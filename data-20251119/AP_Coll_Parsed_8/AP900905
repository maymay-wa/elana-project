themselves in to colombian authorities will not be extradited to 
the united states president cesar gaviria said wednesday in an 
official decree 
gaviria said the policy a notable departure from the past 
forms part of the governments plan to end drugrelated terrorism 
in colombia

demanding an end to extradition the fate drug traffickers fear 
most

terrorist attacks apparantly hoping that the new administration 
would end extraditions gaviria was inaugurated aug 7

themselves in will face lighter sentences 
judges will be given the capacity to reduce sentences of 
those who turn themselves in confess their crimes lay down 
weapons and other goods linked to their crimes and cooperate with 
investigations gaviria said 
in repeated communiques drug traffickers using the pseudonym 
the extraditables offered to turn themselves in to colombian 
judges in an apparant attempt to convince the government to end 
extraditions 
the extraditables communiques bore the letterhead we prefer 
a tomb in colombia to a jail cell in the united states 
gavirias predecessor virgilio barco reinitiated extraditions 
a year ago after drug traffickers declared war on the state 
twentytwo colombians accused of drug trafficking have been 
extradited to the united states since then 
violence meanwhile has soared with policemen in particular 
singled out as targets of hitmen hired by drug traffickers a 
domestic airliner in addition was blown out of the sky this year 
outside bogota killing more than 100 people 
the government has blamem the medellin cartel for killing more 
than 500 people including three presidential candidates 
thousands of others have died in fighting between rival drug 
gangs and violence by rightwing death squads financed by cocaine 
smugglers

awaiting extradition will be sent to the united states 
he said three other extradition requests by the united states

the soviet union will maintain diplomatic ties 
with iraq for now but still demands that iraq end its occupation of 
kuwait tass reported wednesday following president mikhail 
gorbachevs meeting with the iraqi foreign minister 
us sen bob dole said he believed the minister tareq aziz 
was carrying a message for gorbachev to give to president bush at 
the superpower summit in helsinki 
the kansas republican the minority leader in the senate spoke 
to reporters after his own meeting with the soviet president in the 
kremlin aziz met with gorbachev later in the day 
tass said the meeting was held at the request of iraqi president 
saddam hussein and that the two held a frank discussion on the gulf 
crisis 
it said soviet officials emphasised that they want for the 
moment at least to maintain permanent diplomatic contact with 
iraqi leaders 
until now however no political or diplomatic contacts 
between moscow and baghdad have produced the desired result the 
immediate withdrawal of all iraqi troops from kuwait and the 
restoration of that countrys independence and sovereignty tass 
said 
dole said he thought aziz was coming here hopefully to pass 
some message on to gorbachev that might be passed on to president 
bush 
maybe it will provide some breakthrough maybe some little ray 
of hope maybe saddam hussein now realizes he made a big big 
mistake by invading kuwait on aug 2 dole told an airport news 
conference minutes before leaving for washington 
bush and gorbachev meet in the finnish capital sunday the 
crisis following iraqs invasion of kuwait was expected to rank 
high on their agenda 
aziz was to address a news conference thursday at the soviet 
foreign ministry and was expected to discuss the message he was 
believed to have carried 
dole said he and six other republican senators winding up a trip 
to the soviet union just had a very good visit with president 
gorbachev we talked about a number of issues particularly the 
upcoming summit 
we indicated none of us want armed conflict we hope there 
will be a peaceable solution my impression is that gorbachev 
is in almost total agreement on this point 
he indicated it was a turning point that was very important 
for both countries dole said he sees it as a very important 
meeting when you think about this being the two superpowers 
meeting now for the first time with reference to a conflict where 
they are both on the same side 
gorbachev told the senators his meeting with aziz was 
initiated at the request of the iraqis dole reported he 
said in effect i am prepared to hear them out and of course i 
will be reporting to president bush on what was said and what 
transpired 
in an interview broadcast on soviet television wednesday night 
gorbachev described dole as close to president bush and said 
the conversation was important for me in connection with the 
forthcoming meeting in helsinki 
during the interview gorbachev dwelt almost exclusively with an 
economic program he is expected to announce next week to move the 
soviet union closer to a market economy away from the current 
central planning system 
dole replied when pressed on what proposals gorbachev and bush 
might make to end the gulf crisis i wouldnt even speculate on 
what would transpire 
sen john warner rva said he asked gorbachev to clarify 
this question of the soviets there in the capacity of advisers and 
experts referring to 193 soviet employees affiliated with iraqs 
military 
according to warner gorbachev said right away theyre not 
advisers they have not been involved in the hostilities they are 
simply contractors there to work on the equipment we would like to 
bring them back but if we were to break those contracts and bring 
them back home it could well jeopardize the 60008000 soviets 
there on construction contracts 
warner ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee said gorbachev also wanted to sign treaties with the 
united states and other western nations to cut conventional and 
longrange nuclear arms by the end of the year

antisemitism in eastern europe the new york times reported in

four months ago someone painted a small 
rustyred swastika on a stone pillar a few steps from the israeli 
ambassadors home 
he drives by it every day neighbors walk dogs past it children 
play nearby no one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol 
graffiti and other signs of antisemitism are being seen again 
in poland even though it is nearly bereft of jews and the 
prejudice of the streets has begun to infiltrate politics 
some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and 
with a seeming inevitability antisemitism 
on the other side prominent anticommunist figures like adam 
michnik editor of the newspaper gazeta wyborcza and zbigniew 
bujak both leaders of the progovernment democratic action party 
have been sounding the alarm 
solidarity chairman lech walesa indignant at suggestions of 
bigotry on the part of himself or some of his followers declared 
lech walesa is not and will not be antisemitic 
in a resolution july 29 walesas national citizens committee 
condemned both prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of 
antisemitism to smear political opponents members of the 
committee have accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the 
extent of antisemitism in poland 
the late sociologist aleksander hertz a polish jew said 
antisemitism grew in the 19th century in response to polands 
humiliating partitions russian influences and the prosperity of a 
burgeoning jewish population which both the declining aristocracy 
and impoverished peasants resented 
in politics antisemitism peaked just before world war ii when 
it was a major tenet of the popular national democrats university 
students hounded jewish colleagues and antisemites organized 
boycotts of jewish businesses 
three million polish jews were killed by the nazis some of the 
halfmillion who survived owed their lives to poles who hid them 
but others were betrayed by polish acquaintances 
polish jews who lived through the holocaust were traumatized by 
it and feared trying to reclaim homes and property from christians 
particularly after a pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in kielce 
most of them emigrated to israel or the united states 
an official communist purge of zionists prompted the last 
big wave of emigration in 1968 reducing the number of jews to 
500015000 in a nation of 38 million people 
for the first time in centuries poland is without a large 
jewish population and profound changes have resulted 
before the war jews were about 10 percent of the population 
concentrated in towns and cities and made up a large part of the 
middle class the landed aristocracy disdained commerce and 
peasants stuck to their farms so much of the small business trade 
and industry were left to jews 
half a century after nazi occupation poland still has not come 
to grips with the loss of its jewish population any discussion of 
jews is likely to provoke strong emotions often defensive 
polands only rabbi pinchas menachem joskowicz said he had 
noticed more antisemitism recently he used to find respect and 
friendliness when he walked the streets in his traditional orthodox 
garb joskowicz said but now encounters hostility 
two weeks ago i had guests from israel and we went for a 
walk he said in an interview then youths maybe 21 maybe 
younger started shouting jews to palestine and other slogans 
too i did not pay any attention let them shout 
but when we walked a few meters they approached us and started 
hitting one of the guests 
joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know 
what to tell jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to 
visit poland 
there is a tendency to blame jews for the nations troubles 
i keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough 
they are probably jews and they are destroying us walesa told a 
meeting of his national citizens committee on june 24 
he said such remarks do not mean antisemitism is increasing 
but that the government must do a better job of explaining itself 
to the people 
farmers who occupied the agriculture ministry in june demanding 
guaranteed prices were heard muttering about the jewish 
government 
that government is led by a devout roman catholic prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki who identifies with 
christiandemocratic politics and sometimes is accused of being too 
solicitous of the church 
allegations that jews run the government rest on the fact that 
some prominent solidarity politicians are jews two examples are 
michnik and parliament member bronislaw geremek leader of the 
citizens parliamentary club who are of jewish descent but do not 
practice the religion 
communist functionaries used such information in the past in the 
vain hope of discrediting solidarity 
in august the national party a farright group based in the 
southern city of krakow said it was unfair for an ethnic minority 
to have dominance in the government the grunwald society created 
by nationalistic communists contended recently that german and 
jewish chauvinists were the greatest threats to polish 
sovereignty 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska who wrote a 
book on the remaining jews in poland with her husband a 
photographer said antisemitism is coming to the surface in the 
more liberal atmosphere since communist rule 
now everything is free she said many good things have 
come out but also some bad things 
some antisemitism is present in all countries she said and 
i hope it will be marginal in poland too for the future because 
its visible it can be fought

the harsh 
conditions of the saudi desert are taking a toll on us military 
equipment affecting simple mechanical gear as well as sensitive 
hightech equipment from m16 rifles to weapons guidance systems 
the warships patrolling the waters around the arabian peninsula 
are also have problems officers and maintenance crews said 
when you buy a stereo what do the instructions say marine 
gunnery sgt tate ingles of miami asked during a recent interview 
they say you should keep it away from heat dust and vibration 
you put the same electrical gear in the saudi desert and well 
there you have it 
because of the heat and sand weapons systems that rely on 
sensitive electronics and computers could be troublesome to operate 
if extended hostilities broke out technicians say 
at eagle forward a base camp for apache gunships and other 
helicopters of the 101st airborne divisions air assault brigade 
the soft saudi sand blown by the desert wind is the big headache 
its unbelievable it gets everywhere a maintenance crew 
member said 
crews are flushing out the apache engines with water every day 
to rid them of the sand the powdery sand also finds its way into 
transmissions and gears that turn the rotors forcing more frequent 
maintenance on those systems as well 
hovering around in the desert is going to be very hard on the 
engines said maj greg maisel of laredo texas the executive 
officer of a marine attack squadron 
helicopters are being fitted with radiator filters much like the 
black wraps often seen on fronts of sports cars 
we were having a lot of overheating problems because of sand 
clogging the radiators squadron leader lt col don cody said 
we think the filters have fixed that 
the sand scours the paint from rotor blades exposing metal that 
glints in the sun making the helicopters easier to spot 
sand is the reason the air force is cutting the time between its 
routine maintenance tests and routine adjustments made every 100 
hours are now being done every 6075 hours an air force official 
said 
one persistent problem is sand clogging airintake valves of jet 
engines much like the apaches the engines of air force and navy 
planes on the ground and aboard carriers are being flushed with 
water daily 
a marine sergeant cleaning his automatic rifle noted 
sometimes im not sure it would fire if i needed it to we train 
in the desert but ive never seen anything like this 
tanks need more frequent filter cleanings and track flushing and 
higher viscosity oil radiators need to be checked constantly to 
prevent overheating 
the sand cakes on headlights and windshields and can get into 
the fuel supply if proper care is not taken 
weapons systems protected from the sand cant escape the 
scorching sun 
within days of arriving here 82nd airborne units were reporting 
dead radios because wires were burned out or fused by the heat 
one officer in the division said monday that parts for the 
radios and other equipment being damaged are getting hard to come 
by were short quite a few things said the officer who spoke 
on condition of anonymity im sure well get them eventually 
meantime ingenuity is helping 
on tuesday two 82nd soldiers were at a safeway supermarket in a 
saudi town cleaning it out of sponges and cloth a vehicle 
containing several tow antitank missiles and other weapons 
exploded at an 82nd motor pool monday and the men suspect heat was 
a factor 
the equipment problems are frustrating but the maintenance 
crews try to keep a sense of humor 
some officer says hey my radio dont work ingles said 
i tell him sir if youd been sitting out here under a 
magnifying glass in 130degree temperatures all day you wouldnt 
work either

the royal academy of arts in piccadilly opens an 
exhibition of 94 works by monet on friday hoping to draw at least 
a half million visitors over three months more than for any other 
show in its 222year history 
receipts at that level would bring in up to 56 million which 
could be used for its current huge renovation 
the works in the new exhibition monet in the 90s the series 
paintings are among the most beautiful and intriguing that monet 
did in his long life he was 86 when he died in 1926 at his home in 
giverny near paris 
in the 1890s he created series of paintings of the same 
subjects in different weather and light exhibiting each group as 
it was completed 
among the subjects in the show are 11 views of grainstacks 20 
of poplar trees 10 of rouen cathedral seven of misty mornings on 
the seine river 15 of the normandy coast four of the thames and 
five of the japanesestyle bridge over monets waterlily pond 
ten paintings of the creuse valley in central france include one 
loaned by britains queen mother elizabeth 
paul hayes tucker associate professor of art at the university 
of massachusetts spent four years assembling the exhibition from 
five continents and said monets paintings of the 1890s were 
perhaps the grandest incarnation of his art 
they have been collected from all over the world with immense 
difficulties and i believe we wont be able to see them together 
again in our lifetime said academy president roger de grey 
the show with some changes opened at boston museum of fine 
arts in february and was later seen at the art institute of 
chicago london is its only venue in europe 
in 1872 monets style was dubbed impressionism by a 
derisive critic who saw in paris his painting of le havre called 
impression sunrise 
monet subsequently became rich and famous as the father of 
impressionism the most popular art movement the world has ever 
known 
ironically the academy in 1871 turned down three monet 
paintings of london canvases of hyde park green park and the 
thames river at westminster 
the academy is the first gallery in britain to adopt the 
european and american system of selling tickets in advance and has 
already sold 16000 at 5 pounds 935 each 
the show is open daily through dec 9

a supermarket chain has slashed retail 
beef prices by as much as 50 percent and says its partly because 
the persian gulf crisis has cut off the iraqi market for irish meat 
superquinn which has 12 outlets in the greater dublin area has 
reduced the price of boneless rib steak from 320 to 170 per 
pound 
the whole thing is a cynical advertising ploy to grab a bit of 
the market william smith president of the irish master butchers 
association complained on tuesday he contended that wholesale 
prices had held steady 
there is an element of a special offer in it said fergal 
quinn owner of superquinn but he insisted it was a legitimate 
reaction to the gulf crisis 
its influenced by the fact that there is surplus of beef in 
the market place he said 
iraq had been a major buyer of irish beef but the market was 
cut off by a unordered trade embargo following iraqs invasion 
of kuwait on aug 2 
quinn added that the drop in demand was largely for hindquarter 
cuts and he had no plans to mark down the price of sirloin

grateful for soviet backing in the persian 
gulf president bush is unlikely to try to push president mikhail 
s gorbachev beyond his political limits when they meet sunday in 
finland 
at the same time bush will try to help gorbachev where he needs 
it the most his ailing economy 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher will take some 15 chiefs of 
american corporations to moscow to begin discussions on largescale 
technical cooperation 
secretary of state james a baker iii meanwhile will discuss 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze us offers to 
help improve areas such as banking housing the tax system and 
distribution networks 
baker delivered a list of nine projects to shevardnadze in paris 
in midjuly this followed an initial discussion between bush and 
gorbachev at the malta summit last december and bush intends to 
pursue the subject at helsinki provided the persian gulf crisis 
does not take up all their time 
a leader of the communist partys traditionalist wing told 2500 
delegates at a russian party congress tuesday that gorbachevs 
reform program is on the brink of collapse 
ivan k polozkov first secretary of the communist party in the 
russian republic drew vigorous applause from the delegates the 
group includes many generals and career party officials who are 
believed to harbor reservations about gorbachevs policies on 
both the economic and persian gulf fronts 
many of those same conservatives do not seem to agree with the 
soviet leader and shevardnadze his chief interlocutor with the 
us administration that the cold war is over 
gen vladimir lobov the military chief of the warsaw pact was 
quoted last week as expressing grave doubts about the us military 
buildup in the gulf area according to tass the soviet news 
agency he warned that it drastically changes the strategic 
balance in the region 
fighting to keep his reforms going gorbachev cannot risk it all 
by going much further than he has to accommodate bush in his 
campaign against iraqi president saddam hussein 
after some initial hesitation the soviets voted aug 6 in the 
un security council for a worldwide economic boycott of iraq and 
then on aug 25 after more hesitation to use force to implement 
it 
in both instances the soviets could have killed the us moves 
with their veto gorbachev chose instead to support bush in what is 
the most dramatic gesture of superpower cooperation since the 
waning of the cold war 
i dont know where we would be with this effort if it were not 
for the cooperation and enlightened new thinking of the soviet 
leadership baker told the house foreign affairs committee on 
tuesday 
and yet to keep peace with their political foes gorbachev and 
shevardnadze also are stressing the explosive nature of the 
situation in the gulf and urging a speedy political settlement it 
is a view endorsed last weekend in beijing by chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen after three hours of talks with shevardnadze 
if bush could have his way the soviets would yank the 193 
military advisers and some 1000 other soviet nationals involved in 
training maintenance and other militaryrelated tasks in iraq 
they are remnants of the kremlins longterm close military ties to 
the saddam government 
we think quite frankly it is inappropriate to be providing 
any military assistance to iraq at the present time and we will 
continue to talk to the soviets about the 193 baker told the 
house committee 
but he said it was not clear the soviet advisers are free to 
leave some 8000 soviet nationals are in iraq and kuwait 
so as bushs helsinki summit with gorbachev shapes up the 
president will emphasize the cooperation he is getting from the 
kremlin and not haggle over the bumps in the road 
we want to keep them on the reservation a senior us 
official told the associated press on tuesday we are not asking 
for anything specific at the moment 
a key us objective he said is to assure the soviets that the 
military operation in the persian gulf is not directed against 
moscow 
in all 26 countries have sent in military forces many of them 
token contributions 
while the west and japan rely far more than the soviet union on 
gulf petroleum the soviets are a superpower with close ties to a 
number of arab countries and clearly do not want the area dominated 
by the united states 
bush is bound to make the point to gorbachev repeatedly that the 
us objective is to force iraq to reverse its annexation of kuwait 
and no more than that

the united states is working to develop a 
longterm alliance to stabilize the middle east in much the way 
that nato was used to contain soviet expansion after world war ii 
secretary of state james a baker iii says 
at a hearing tuesday before the house foreign affairs committee 
baker described the alliance as a new security structure for 
the region he told a reporter later that it could be military in 
nature or diplomatic and political 
the us role remains to be defined but the new entity would 
include major arab participation said baker who also was 
testifying today before the senate foreign relations committee 
weve still got a lot of work to do baker said after a 
threehour hearing in which he addressed for the first time 
publicly how the united states ultimately might deal with the 
continuing threat posed by iraqi president saddam hussein whose 
forces invaded kuwait on aug 2 
addressing the expense of the us military operation in the 
persian gulf baker said leadership sometimes does cost its 
going to run us probably around 6 billion for the balance of 
1990 
at the same time some lawmakers reacted coolly to tuesdays 
announcement by the white house that president bush wants to 
forgive 7 billion in past military loans to egypt a reward for 
president hosni mubaraks leadership in marshaling arab opinion 
against saddam 
such a move would require action by congress lawmakers said 
they valued egypts action but they were wary of the high figure 
which is equal to half of next years total foreign aid budget 
its a small price to pay for the level of cooperation weve 
gotten from egypt said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but the price looked a lot larger on capitol hill 
it may be a little premature said house minority leader 
robert michel rill just back from a fourday trip to the middle 
east during which he and other lawmakers met with mubarak i 
would like to hear firsthand from the administration the 
rationale michel added 
sen patrick leahy dvt whose senate appropriations foreign 
aid subcommittee must deal with the request predicted that other 
nations israel pakistan greece and turkey for example will 
be lining up for similar favors 
i know its going to be necessary to increase some foreign aid 
dollars as a result of operation desert shield the military and 
economic drive against iraq leahy said in an interview but he 
added it looks like some in the administration are saying lets 
have a blank check for foreign aid i want to remind them that my 
subcommittees still got the checkbook 
baker in his testimony to the house committee said creation of 
a new multilateral security structure is likely to be required 
even if there is a pullback from kuwait 
the new structure would involve some continuing us 
presence he said maybe it wouldnt be a ground force 
presence maybe it would be a naval presence 
when asked by rep stephen solarz dny whether any 
multinational arrangement could prevent saddam from developing 
nuclear weapons or from using the chemical and biological arsenal 
he already has bakers answer sounded much like cold war 
deterrence 
it is conceivably possible to come up with a security 
structure that would make it so clearly to the detriment of any 
subsequent leader or even the present leader to use or 
contemplate using any of those weapons that there would be very 
little risk that they would be used baker said 
in other comments baker said 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat jumped 
too quick in aligning himself with iraq in the crisis as money 
flowing back home to palestinian families from workers inside iraq 
falls off i think there could well be some reassessment of 
that commitment he said you are beginning to see in public 
comments and in other ways that a reassessment is going on 
the united states has added iraq to its official list of 
countries sponsoring terrorism the move which carries certain 
automatic trade sanctions was largely symbolic because iraq 
already is under a total economic embargo

an appeals court panel tuesday postponed the 
execution of a convicted murderer after hearing arguments that he 
was coerced into confessing by a sheriff who now is a congressman 
us rep tommy robinson has denied allegations he and his 
pulaski county deputies beat defendant barry lee fairchild and five 
other black suspects and urged them to confess to the killing of an 
air force nurse 
fairchild 36 was scheduled to die by lethal injection at 9 
pm wednesday for the 1983 abduction rape and murder of marjorie 
greta mason 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals on a 30 vote ordered 
the case returned to us district court for a hearing on the 
allegations 
the state attorney generals office was preparing to petition 
the us supreme court to dissolve the stay and let the execution 
proceed 
assistant attorney general jack gillean said he would argue in a 
petition to be filed wednesday morning that that defense attorneys 
failed to present a plausible case that fairchild is innocent he 
said that is a requirement this late in the appeals process 
fairchilds attorneys say he is mildly retarded with an iq 
between the 60s and 80s and contend he was easy prey for 
authorities seeking to force a confession he confessed twice but 
later said the statements were coerced 
his lawyers also contend that someone other than fairchild 
confessed to the murder they said police later dropped the man as 
a suspect because he provided few details about the crime 
we are not just dealing with coerced confessions we are 
dealing with what appears to be investigative practices that do not 
depend on collecting evidence richard burr of the naacp legal 
defense fund told the panel we are dealing with a systematic 
practice of culling out suspects based on whos the weakest 
before the stay was issued robinson the congressman issued a 
news release saying the attorneys for barry lee fairchild have 
lost all credibility the affidavits filed today are the desperate 
lastminute moves of ambulancechasing publicityseeking lawyers 
who care more about ego gratification and about their own press 
clippings than they care about our system of justice 
robinson was elected as a democrat but switched to the 
republican party he lost the gop primary for governor this year 
and isnt seeking reelection to the house 
in recent days burr of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and defense attorney john wesley 
hall said they got a tip that four other men were beaten the 
attorneys and their staffs interviewed nolan mccoy frankie webb 
donald lewis and randy mitchell concerning the allegations three 
of the four men are state inmates 
they were beaten several were bloodied in the beatings that 
were inflicted the attorneys said in tuesdays pleading they 
were threatened with guns often thrust into their faces and they 
were kicked all were pushed and shoved and knocked around they 
were terrorized racially threatened with hanging and with being 
killed and thrown in the river they were called nigger they had 
a barrage of pejorative epithets thrown their way and they were 
all told we know you were involved 
a spokesman for the lower court said a date for the hearing had 
yet to be set 
the hearing tuesday was conducted by telephone conference in the 
little rock office of judge richard s arnold judges donald ross 
of omaha neb and frank magill of fargo nd participated

a dentist believed to have given a 
patient aids during a tooth extraction has sent others he once 
treated a warning letter suggesting they get tested for the virus 
i am sorry i cannot tell you this face to face but i am dying 
of this disease wrote dr david j acer of stuart i am very 
close to the end 
the centers for disease control last month reported that a 
21yearold woman contracted aids during a dental visit the 
nations first known instance of a health professional apparently 
giving the disease to a patient 
the agency did not identify the dentist or the patient and said 
it was not clear how the virus was transmitted 
i do not understand how such a thing could have happened and 
i do not believe it did happen acer wrote i am a gentle man 
and i would never intentionally expose anyone to this disease 
the dentist sent a copy of the letter to the state department of 
health and rehabilitative services which released it tuesday it 
was unclear how many he sent to former patients 
the letter does not say when acer learned he had aids or how 
long he practiced afterward he said he stopped when he got 
aidsrelated cancer 
acer whose telephone number is unlisted could not be reached 
for comment 
while hrs never publicly confirmed that the dentist in the cdc 
report practiced in florida the agency said it had the ability to 
track down patients and urge them to take an aids test 
but under state confidentiality laws hrs would be prevented 
from telling the patients that their connection to the dentist had 
prompted the advice 
acer said he consulted experts after testing positive for the 
aids virus and was assured he could continue practicing among the 
guidelines he followed were those from the cdc itself such as 
wearing gloves and a mask he said 
acer said he did not suffer a puncture wound that could have 
exposed the patient to infected blood 
because i was aware that i had the hiv virus i was extremely 
careful in how i practiced dentistry he said 
nevertheless acer said he understood that former patients could 
be frightened and suggested they contact health authorities for 
testing and counseling 
i have cared for people all my life and to infect anyone with 
this disease would be contrary to everything i have stood for he 
wrote i am sorry if the news story has caused you fear and 
worry 
a 22yearold woman identified only as kb has taken steps to 
sue a dr da for malpractice in state court in palm beach 
according to court papers a motion says the woman went to the 
dentist in 1987 and contracted aids from him 
the lawsuit has yet to be filed the motion asked that the woman 
be allowed to testify via videotape because she is in the advanced 
stages of the disease a judge granted the request last month

israelis awoke the other day to a new bumper 
sticker come on saddam step on the gas 
the slogan was an example of the macabre humor that has cropped 
up as israelis try to cope with the tension and uncertainty born of 
threats from iraqi president saddam husseins to attack them with 
chemical weapons 
both saddam and chemical weapons have become sources of gallows 
humor a new tshirt features a picture of saddam with the legend 
wanted for murder jaywalking and armed robbery 
a popular theme for satirists and cartoonists are the 
longsnouted gas masks to be distributed to civilians in case of an 
iraqi attack 
the jokes began after saddam first issued his threat in april 
saying he would annihilate half of israel with binary chemical 
weapons if israel were to attack his country with nuclear weapons 
statecontrolled television picked up the theme in a skit that 
also played on the heated political horsetrading going on then to 
form a new government it showed several friends wearing gas masks 
and playing cards 
as the camera zoomed in on one of the players he lifted his 
mask and said with a sigh of admiration that saddam is an ok 
guy thanks to him you cant smell the stink of the politics in 
this place 
saddams invasion of kuwait last month followed by an 
acrimonious public debate about whether to distribute gas masks at 
once provided humorists with fresh material 
the mass circulation maariv newspaper ran a twopage spread of 
cartoons called gas masks in our daily lives one of the frames 
showed an attack dog running away from a mailman wearing a gas mask 
a popular prime time television show featured a wife at the 
dinner table complaining about the husbands noisy eating habits 
the camera then turned to the husband his face covered by a gas 
mask with strands of spaghetti dangling from the nose filter 
you try eating through this thing he said angrily 
israelis surrounded by hostile arab states and hardened by the 
wars they endured during the countrys four decades are a 
responsive audience

new york post management told its unions tuesday 
that the paper had to have a cost cutting plan by the end of next 
week and indicated the continued publication of the nations oldest 
daily was at stake 
post vice president and general manager richard t nasti said 
after a meeting with leaders of the papers 10 unions that the 
paper has set sept 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement he 
said he was optimistic the deadline will be met 
nasti didnt say specifically what would happen if the deadline 
werent met 
theodore kheel a labor mediator and unpaid adviser a union 
group who attended the meeting said he understood that management 
would suspend publication sept 15 if it couldnt reach agreement 
with the unions on 17 million in savings 
the papers 900 employees and 10 unions are represented by the 
allied printing trades council 
the councils president george mcdonald said management told 
us they are losing money and they are looking for some relief from 
the unions the losses have been blamed in part on the citys 
slumping economy 
publisher peter kalikow called the meeting and said through a 
spokesman the session was very cordial not a hostile meeting 
with both sides trying to work it out 
the post offered to open its books to its 10 unions and 
meetings with individual unions are scheduled throughout wednesday 
and thursday 
in a prepared statement nasti said management officials would 
meet with each union for lengthy and detailed explanations of 
their cost saving proposals 
this newspaper has served new york for 190 years and through a 
cooperative effort between labor and management it will continue to 
serve new york for another 190 years he said 
kalikow must find 25 million in annual savings to continue 
publishing the paper nasti said 
kheel said the 17 million figure is the amount the post hopes 
to save through costcutting measures affecting its unions with 
the rest to be made up in other ways 
kalikow took over the post from rupert murdoch in 1988 when the 
paper was losing about 3 million monthly concessions from the 
unions were part of the package that murdoch had to achieve in 
order to meet kalikows terms 
those same unions are now involved in intense negotiations with 
the rival daily news of new york the news is seeking contracts 
that would allow management to institute a variety of cost saving 
measures that the news says are critical to its survival

the agriculture departments food guardians 
are getting steady pressure from the meat industry to soften the 
round of inspection layoffs that will occur next month if congress 
and the white house fail to reach a budget agreement 
but the plan for furloughing thousands of federal meat and 
poultry inspectors for several days every twoweek pay period 
beginning oct 1 the start of fiscal year 1991 is still in 
effect officials said tuesday 
the die is cast and unless something is done the furlough 
will take place said spokesman jim greene of the departments 
food safety and inspection service 
last week the inspection agency notified the nations 6300 
federally inspected meat and poultry plants that the initial layoff 
order by president bush would be for a maximum of 36 hours during 
the oct 114 period 
agency administrator lester crawford said the layoffs would 
effectively shut down plants during the furlough periods 
the white house meanwhile said it is willing to listen to 
proposals for a budget reduction of less than 50 billion the 
current target under the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
budget negotiators will resume talks in private at andrews air 
force base md in hopes of reaching an agreement by sunday 
meanwhile if layoffs take effect on oct 1 as currently 
planned it could mean hardships for the industry and consumers 
said the american meat institute a trade association 
furloughs are not the answer said institute president j 
patrick boyle at best it would take years for the industry and 
the economy to recover the losses generated from furloughs of the 
magnitude being discussed for fiscal 1991 
the meat and poultry industry asked agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter to find alternative methods of coping with the 
inspection agencys budget problems including the possibility of 
giving inspectors priority status so they could keep production 
lines moving 
closing factory doors has unacceptable costs not only to 
plant workers who would be denied their jobs but to consumers 
who would be denied essential food products and to the government 
which would be denied additional tax revenues the groups told 
yeutter 
a shutdown of one day would idle 356000 workers halt livestock 
and poultry purchases from producers and cost nearly 1 billion in 
lost sales throughout the marketing chain they said 
however fsis administrator crawford said the industrys request 
for giving inspectors priority for remaining on the job would not 
work 
in plant inspectors import inspectors and circuit supervisors 
comprise 82 percent of our work force he said the remaining 
18 percent represents laboratory technicians compliance officers 
label reviewers and administrative staff that are essential to 
carrying out the fsis label 
about 88 percent of the agencys budget is salaries crawford 
said and 46 percent of its money is for fixed nonsalary costs 
that must be paid with or without a furlough

spraying chemicals to kill grasshoppers on 
land set aside under the conservation reserve program is not 
expected to have significant harmful effects according to studies 
by the agriculture department 
the environmental assessments by usda involved crp land in 
idaho western minnesota and the dakotas a region of severe 
grasshopper infestation officials said tuesday 
land in the program is taken from crop production for 10 years 
and planted to protective grass and trees 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said crp land poses an extremely 
inviting target to grasshoppers which can consume all vegetation 
in an infested area 
the assessments were made under an assumption that grasshoppers 
will be controlled through an integrated pest management program 
using several methods including spraying with malathion carbaryl 
and acephate as well as using baits containing carbaryl or nosema 
locustae 
however glosser said the use of nosema a biological control 
agent will not be used on crp land this year because it does not 
achieve the quick knockdown of grasshoppers needed to protect 
nearby crops 
the assessments were said to cover effects on human health 
endangered species other wildlife water resources aquatic 
species soil vegetation air quality land use cultural 
resources and economic concerns

a new mechanical big foot with legs and feet 
instead of wheels is being developed to prowl forests the 
agriculture department says 
the vehicle will soon be strolling about the woods of 
southwest virginia near blacksburg home of virginia polytechnic 
institute and state university one of the machines developers 
the department said tuesday 
products technologist robert koeppen of the forest service said 
the machine could solve some forest management problems while 
helping protect forest ecosystems 
currently forest managers depend on rubbertired vehicles 
which can cause soil compaction rutting or damage to vegetation 
the agency said wheeled vehicles also are limited by terrain that 
is too rough steep wet or soft 
the machine called the robotic walking vehicle may 
alleviate such problems for example it can move sideways a 
maneuver koeppen said may help drastically reduce damage to forest 
soils and vegetation 
a public unveiling of the machine has been scheduled for sept 
11 at virginia tech with field tests to begin later this month 
the tests will include the machines performance on level 
mountainous and simulated lowlying wetland terrain

one percent of american families would save an 
average 19599 from a proposed capital gains tax cut while 80 
percent would face higher taxes to pay for the benefits according 
to a private analysis released today 
the fourfifths of american families whose incomes are below 
61000 would receive an average capital gains tax benefit of only 
30 according to the study by citizens for tax justice a 
coalition of labor public interest and citizens groups 
since most families own no capital assets other than their 
homes most actually would get no capital gains tax break at all 
it said these people would face higher taxes to pay for the cost 
of this enormous new loophole for the very wealthy 
those whose incomes place them in the top 1 percent would get an 
average tax cut of 19599 it said 
the washingtonbased citizens for tax justice describes itself 
as a nonprofit nonpartisan coalition working for fairer taxes at 
the federal state and local levels 
capital gains are profits from the sale of stock real estate 
and other investments they now are taxed at the same rates that 
apply to wages and other income 
president bush has made cutting the tax a top priority 
contending such a reduction is needed to keep the economy growing 
his administration has pressed for a reduction during this years 
budget negotiations with members of congress the talks are due to 
resume this week 
the administration has never denied that the wealthiest 
taxpayers would be the biggest beneficiaries of a capital gains tax 
cut but it contends that the proposed tax cut would spur 
investment and create jobs 
the treasury has projected the cut would raise tax collections 
every year and by 125 billion over the 199095 period however 
the congressional joint committee on taxation forecasts annual 
revenue losses after the first two years and losses totaling 114 
billion for 199095 
the congressional budget office last week said a capital gains 
tax reduction could not be counted on to give a significant 
boost to american economic growth 
it is unlikely that the increase in income would generate 
enough additional tax revenue to offset losses to the treasury 
it said 
citizens for tax justice said middleclass americans would not 
benefit from a capital gains tax cut because their incomes come 
mainly from salaries and wages not from stock portfolios or real 
estate holdings 
the wealthy are the only ones who benefit from reduced taxes 
on asset sales because they own the lions share of the assets in 
the first place it said 
the analysis also suggested that because the wealthy in 
california new york texas florida illinois and new jersey are 
so much richer and more numerous than in other states more than 
half of the cuts would go to residents of those six states

irancontra prosecutor lawrence e walsh wants 
a federal appeals court to reconsider its split decision that set 
aside three felony convictions against former white house aide 
oliver l north 
calling the 21 decision unprecedented and unwarranted the 
independent counsel asked the threejudge panel of the us court 
of appeals for the district of colombia to rehear the case walsh 
also suggested a rehearing by all 12 members of the court 
the tartly worded petition charged that circuit judges laurence 
silberman and david sentelle used faulty logic and a plain 
misreading of the record in the case to set aside norths 
convictions 
over the dissent of chief judge patricia wald the two appeals 
judges ordered a hearing to determine if trial witnesses were 
influenced by the testimony that north gave congress under a 
limited grant of immunity from prosecution 
the socalled use immunity granted by the congressional 
irancontra committees barred walsh from using norths televised 
testimony as evidence or for leads in his investigation 
walsh called the panels order an unwarranted extension of use 
immunity protection that was particularly unjustified because 
he took special precautions to make sure that prosecutors were not 
exposed to norths testimony trial witnesses were instructed by 
us district judge gerhard a gesell to testify only from their 
personal knowledge 
the prohibitions against prosecuting based on norths immunized 
testimony do not extend to the independent conduct of thirdparty 
witnesses particularly witnesses who testify on the basis of 
personal knowledge walsh said in the petition 
to conduct the hearing according to the appellate panels 
instructions gesell would have to probe the psychological 
processes of each witness many of whom are irrelevant to the 
conviction walsh said 
the standards the appellate court set for a witness by 
witness hearing would make virtually impossible the criminal 
prosecution of a person who provides public immunized testimony 
walsh said quoting from walds dissent 
north a former national security council aide who coordinated 
secret support for the nicaraguan contras was convicted of aiding 
and abetting the obstruction of congress destruction or alteration 
of government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity the 
construction of a security fence around his house 
north was fined 150000 and ordered to perform 1200 hours of 
community service 
if it is allowed to stand the july 20 appellate court decision 
could invalidate the five felony convictions of norths old boss 
former national security adviser john m poindexter who is 
appealing his sixmonth sentence 
the retired navy rear admiral who was convicted of lying to 
congress about the irancontra affair also gave immunized 
testimony on capitol hill 
walsh filed the petition tuesday as prosecutors from his office 
began trying a tax case against a former cia agent who participated 
in the sale of us arms to iran 
thomas clines who assisted retired maj gen richard v secord 
and arms dealer albert hakim is accused of not fully reporting on 
his incometax forms the commissions he earned from the arms deals 
prosecutors claim that clines earned 875000 from the 
armsforhostages sales 
both secord and hakim who have pleaded guilty to other 
irancontra charges are expected to testify against clines at the 
trial in federal court in baltimore

the greyhound drivers union is cutting off 
50aweek strike benefits for those still waging a 6monthold 
strike because it says it needs the unions remaining money for 
legal battles 
the halt of benefits for the unions 6000 drivers should not 
be taken by anyone as a signal that we are abandoning the strike or 
the campaign we have been waging amalgamated transit union 
president jim la sala said in a letter released tuesday 
the union already has spent more than 6 million on the strike 
according the letter to local union leaders 
strike benefits have to be discontinued starting sept 13 la 
sala said because the unions socalled defense fund was about 
to drop below 2 million 
remaining resources are needed for legal fights the unions 
involvement in bankruptcy proceedings and its buyout effort la 
sala said 
i can fully understand that many of our members manning the 
picket lines may well feel betrayed to the contrary this 
union has made a pledge that greyhound will never operate in a 
picketfree environment so long as our strike continues la sala 
said 
frank motsay president of local 1610 in washington said 
drivers knew the strike benefits eventually would run out and that 
he did not expect it to affect morale on the picket line 
i think its only natural to assume that none of these things 
have a bottomless pit fifty dollars a week is not whats keeping 
them out on the picket line our people are out their for a 
just cause to improve their working condition and wages motsay 
said 
many of the striking drivers have found other jobs since the 
strike began or are receiving unemployment benefits that exceed the 
50aweek union benefit la salas letter said 
greyhound drivers walked out march 2 in a dispute over wages and 
job security since the dispute began greyhound has operated a 
reduced schedule with about 3000 strikebreakers it hired and has 
said it has no plans to resume negotiations with union drivers 
the bus line now in the protection of bankruptcy court has 
been hurt financially as well it blames its money troubles on 
security and legal costs that stem from initial strike violence 
that it charges was orchestrated by union leaders 
la salas letter said that if strike benefits were continued 
the international unions defense fund would be in jeopardy and 
forced assessments might cause the total destruction of some 
local unions 
while the bus line has said the strike is in effect over because 
greyhound has continued operations with replacement drivers the 
union is hoping for other possible solutions 
those include the possibility that a bankruptcy judge might 
replace greyhound chairman fred g currey with a trustee willing to 
resume negotiations with union drivers another possible solution 
would be for a new york investment banking firm the blackstone 
group to take over the company the firm already has said a 
takeover would include bringing union drivers back and possibly 
allowing employees to have part ownership 
in addition theres the chance that a national labor relations 
board administrative law judge in milwaukee will agree with the 
boards general counsel and find that greyhound engaged in unfair 
labor practices that would mean the bus line would have to take 
back the union and give drivers back pay amounting to as much as 
10 million a month however the bus line has already said it 
would appeal such a decision which could mean court battles for 
years 
greyhound contends its financial problems will be resolved with 
a reorganization plan that streamlines the companys operations

secretary of state james a baker iii is the 
latest administration official to suggest that the united states 
would welcome saddam husseins departure from office in iraq such 
leavetakings ordinarily come by way of the assassins bullet 
the idea of ending the persian gulf crisis by having saddam 
killed is much discussed in washington some see it as an 
alternative to a brutal war that would kill thousands of iraqis and 
americans alike to achieve the same end 
as might be expected no one in the executive branch is openly 
advocating saddams murder 
for one thing assassinations are a violation of american 
policy first enunciated in writing by president ford 14 years ago 
in response to suspicions that americans had a hand in the murder 
of the leftist president of chile salvadore allende 
for another the experts including three former cia directors 
say it would be extremely difficult to arrange 
saddam is on guard he has survived dozens of assassinations 
attempts he came to office through that route thats how leaders 
normally rise in his country 
the wall street journal quoted sahib alhakin an iraqi 
dissident in london as saying that removing saddam would not make 
much difference because those around him who might take over are as 
ruthless 
baker told the house foreign affairs committee on tuesday that 
it would not make the administration terribly unhappy if the 
people of iraq decided they wanted a new leader 
but he added thats up to the people of iraq 
sen richard lugar rind is as forthright as anyone in saying 
the us goal should be saddams removal it seems to me 
important that saddam hussein must either leave or be removed he 
said 
president bush asked about lugars view said last week that he 
had great respect for dick lugar but added that he had not 
altered his publicly stated objectives of which saddams 
removal is not one 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger has written that 
any outcome that leaves saddam hussein in place and his military 
machine unimpaired might turn out to be only an interlude between 
aggressions 
early in the crisis bush himself said he hoped the iraqi people 
would do something unless saddam changes his spots 
but former cia director stansfield turner said assassinations 
offend american morality and can backfire 
i dont think an american could possibly kill saddam hussein 
and survive so youd end up hiring someone else and who knows what 
they might do turner said they might kill 5000 people to get 
hussein its a very chancy thing 
richard helms another excia chief said when push comes to 
shove americans dont believe in having america assassinate 
foreign leaders they want somebody else to pull the trigger 
and william colby who also once ran the agency said that bush 
clearly hopes the economic squeeze on iraq will become so severe 
that within the country people will get the idea weve got to 
get rid of this guy 
once before in the panama invasion that resulted in the arrest 
of manuel noriega bush suggested that the people themselves 
remove his antagonist but when panamanian military leaders plotted 
a coup and sought american help signals got crossed and the 
attempt failed 
rep dave mccurdy dokla a member of the house intelligence 
committee was asked as he was leaving on a trip to visit us 
troops in saudi arabia last week about saddams removal 
the future of saddam hussein is of concern to everyone the 
potential power and resources he would have available the 
congressman said you fear his ability to regroup 
but as far as an assassination mccurdy said simply thats 
out of our hands 
shirheen t hunter a mideast expert at the center for strategic 
and international studies in washington said she did not think 
us intelligence forces have the kind of network inside iraq 
that we can pull this kind of thing 
saddam she said is extremely heavily guarded his security 
forces are loyal mostly his relatives or members of his village 
i dont think it is a serious policy option 
the ford executive order directs that no one employed by or 
acting on behalf of the united states government shall engage in 
or conspire to engage in assassination 
jimmy carter and ronald reagan renewed the order bush has not 
but it remains in effect 
it is a policy not a law however and carries no penalty bush 
could revoke it publicly or secretly or simply override it by 
ordering an assassination effort

to the hundreds of millions of moslems 
who live outside the arab world saddam hussein is generally 
considered either a demon or a champion of islam 
some perceive the iraqi president a hero others call him a 
tyrant and fear he will bring disaster to the persian gulf cradle 
of the moslem faith 
nearly twothirds of the worlds estimated 1 billion moslems are 
nonarabs they live in a crescent that reaches from the sands and 
jungles of black africa to the steppes of central asia and juts out 
to islands in the pacific ocean 
the nonarab moslems like their coreligionists in the middle 
east are divided in their opinion of saddam and the presence of 
us troops in the gulf 
some despise him 
some have given him a new name saddma hussein saddma 
means sorrow in the urdu language spoken by many moslems in india 
and pakistan iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait has brought misery 
and fears of greater poverty to a halfmillion south asians who 
worked there 
some revere him 
in bangladesh where moslems account for 90 percent of the 110 
million people the government has promised to send 1200 soldiers 
to saudi arabia to guard against further iraqi aggression but at 
least 5500 civilians have volunteered to fight on the iraqi side 
if war breaks out 
i have offered to fight for iraq because president saddam 
hussein is a champion of islamic revivalism said mohammad 
faisal a businessman in dhaka bangladeshs capital 
in predominantly hindu india whose 105 million moslems give it 
the secondlargest moslem population of any country in the world 
the iraqi consul general in bombay has compiled a list of moslem 
volunteers the sunday mail newspaper reported 
we intend to call up these reserves if and when the need 
arises amer naji the consul general said 
in new delhi hundreds of moslems emerging from their weekly 
prayers on friday burned an effigy of president bush to protest the 
american deployment in saudi arabia 
in jakarta capital of indonesia the islamic council for the 
defense of the holy land called a rally to deplore the iraqi 
invasion the 2000 demonstrators also called on the united states 
to withdraw from the gulf indonesia with 162 million moslems is 
the largest moslem country in the world 
the countrys largest moslem organization muhannadiyah has 
urged the americans not to take any arbitrary action 
the us presence is not genuinely aimed at defending the 
interest of an invaded country said yuwono subarsong dean of 
the political faculty of the indonesian university 
he said washington only wants to ensure its oil supply to 
maintain the american way of life 
in pakistan a moslem state with 103 million adherents of the 
religion a poll of 700 people showed 74 percent supported the 
governments decision to send troops to saudi arabia while 11 
percent opposed it but the same poll showed 62 percent opposed the 
presence of american forces in saudi arabia home of the moslem 
worlds most sacred shrines 
in the past two weeks moslem fundamentalists have staged noisy 
but nonviolent antiamerican protests in islamabad karachi and 
other cities 
in india the government avoided direct criticism of saddam and 
thanked him for helping some of the 180000 indian workers in 
kuwait and iraq return home but posters have appeared in the jama 
masjid a new delhi mosque that is one of the worlds largest 
asking iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
in malaysia where 45 percent of the countrys 178 million 
people are moslem the government has backed the united nations 
sanctions against iraq but the opposition pan islamic party held a 
demonstration calling for us withdrawal 
most west african nations with large moslem populations have 
either remained silent or criticized iraq initially and then kept 
quiet 
nigeria africas most populous nation with 119 million people 
half of them moslem has said very little about the invasion but 
it has defied saddams orders to close its embassy in kuwait 
in uganda moslem leaders have criticised hussein 
umar kaggwa a kampala businessman said he thought saddam 
should have learned a lesson from former ugandan leader gen idi 
amin who invaded tanzania and precipitatated his own downfall in 
1978 
i think saddam is mad kaggwa said

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
possible duty in saudi arabia national writer fred bayles is 
following the 14 guardsmen as they prepare for deployment overseas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a silent semicircle of men stood in a 
room with dirt floors and unfinished walls at their center a 
candle heated a coffee can holding five tear gas tablets 
one by one as if in some initiation ceremony the men drank 
from hoses in cumbersome gas masks then took them off counted to 
10 spelled their last name and recited their social security 
numbers 
voices cracked halfway through the litany 
this mild torture suffered by the 14 members of the 265th 
quartermaster detachment is part of regular training for all us 
soldiers 
but for the water purification unit of the south carolina 
national guard the session in the posts gas chamber had added 
significance it marked the end of chemical warfare training meant 
to prepare the unit for mideast duty 
mobilized for deployment last week the allendale sc unit 
had spent four of six training days brushing up on nbc nuclear 
biological and chemical warfare 
the men heard lectures and watched movies about the effects of 
nerve agents choking gases and blister gas they walked in 
90degree heat wearing gas masks hoods overboots and bulky 
chemical warfare suits 
the gas chamber was a final stop to show the men their equipment 
worked 
with masks on the tear gas had little effect when masks came 
off the air in the dim room felt red hot as if the candles heat 
was everywhere the exposed faces went through escalating degrees 
of pain from the sensation of a slight sunburn to that of flayed 
flesh 
a quick walk into the outside breeze and a splash of water from 
a canteen cleared it away 
stings a little but it wasnt so bad said mark rooker at 
20 the youngest member of the unit 
to celebrate the 265ths graduation 2nd army commander lt gen 
james crysel came by the chamber 
crysel whose command includes the federalized 265th stood 
downwind from the chamber impervious to its fumes he spoke to 
several of the men about their unit and their families 
the men looking like mole people in their chemical warfare 
mufti gave muffled answers 
the 265ths men were assured all through training that the 
equipment can save their lives the bigger problem is functioning 
as a soldier in the claustrophobia of the mask and overgarments 
that quickly leave a man soaked through with sweat and smeared with 
the charcoal from the suits liner 
some people get an attitude in the mask said sgt van 
toliver a post instructor warned the group it makes you 
angry 
before the gas chamber session the men spent an hour in suits 
and masks practicing the frustrating task of swapping contaminated 
protective clothes for fresh ones 
when the sweatdrenched men finally removed their masks the 
anger sgt toliver warned of was obvious 
they throw gas at us when were over there and were going to 
die said ulysses calhoun one of the units younger members 
might as well take off the mask and get it over with 
not everyone agreed 
ill stay with the mask said sgt hullie cohen a guardsman 
for 16 years i plan to do what i can to survive 
cohen a burly 40yearold brick mason often breaks a moment of 
tension with a joke he is equally deliberate on the basketball 
court choosing his shots while the units younger members gun for 
impossible baskets it seems he rarely misses 
it was cohens first time in the gas chamber he was one of the 
few who volunteered to go through again this time without a mask 
i just wanted to see what i could stand he said the gas 
temporarily blinded him he had to be led out

sen sam nunn of georgia is changing his 
position on the governments role in regulating abortion saying 
the decision should be left to the informed conscience of the 
mother in most cases 
nunn a conservative democrat previously had supported proposed 
constitutional amendments to overturn the supreme courts 1973 
decision legalizing abortion 
but he now favors leaving the decision prior to viability of 
the fetus to the informed conscience of the mother nunn wrote 
in a letter to constituents 
he favors prohibiting abortions after viability except in 
cases where the life of the mother is threatened the letter 
added 
while roe vs wade was a questionable constitutional decision 
the viability standard it established may now be the best 
legislative policy on abortion said nunn 
nunn is regarded as a potential presidential candidate in 1992 
he began rethinking the abortion question after it became 
apparent that changes in the makeup of the supreme court could 
force congress to decide when the government should intervene in 
the abortion decision said his press secretary scott williams 
in the letter nunn said he still considers abortion a tragedy 
and an act of great moral consequence that should be strongly 
discouraged except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of 
the mother is endangered 
but he said he concluded that laws prohibiting early abortions 
cannot be enforced because legalized abortion has been the law of 
the land since the 1973 supreme court decision

an ohio family in which nine members 
developed a potentially crippling form of arthritis has helped 
researchers isolate a gene that may be responsible for the 
degenerative disease 
researchers led by dr darwin j prockop of thomas jefferson 
university in philadelphia and dr roland w moskowitz of case 
western reserve university in cleveland surveyed the genetic 
pattern of three generations of the family and found a faulty gene 
that produces a protein mutation 
the genetic flaw changes a single amino acid in the structure of 
a component in cartilage and this leads to an early onset of 
arthritis prockop said at a news conference tuesday 
we now know that a gene can cause the problem said prockop 
moskowitz said the gene apparently is not responsible for 
osteoarthritis in all families where the disease is common 
we think it is likely that other genes are involved he said 
the cause of primary osteoarthritis has long eluded science even 
though it is one of the most common complaints among people past 
the age of 55 affecting about 16 million americans 
the disease causes a breakdown or erosion of cartilage that 
covers and cushions joints it can affect any joint but most 
commonly the hands ankles knees and hips severe cases can lead 
to crippling that can be corrected only by replacing the diseased 
joint with an artificial one 
currently treatment consists only of treating symptoms and 
relieving inflammation 
prockop said that with the arthritis gene identified scientists 
now have a research target that could lead to drugs to prevent or 
arrest the disease process however such drugs will take years to 
develop he said 
in the family that was studied prockop said the researchers 
found that there was one defective gene and one good gene for the 
production of collagen ii a protein that is the primary component 
in cartilage the defective gene substitutes an amino acid called 
cysteine for one called arginine he said the result is an altered 
and weaken collagen and this leads to an early onset of arthritis 
with this discovery we hope to find ways to make the good 
gene work better and the bad gene work less well said prockop 
researchers started studying the ohio family which was not 
identified after a physician referred them to moskowitz 
three generations of the family starting with the father in the 
first generation suffer from osteoarthritis 
in the second generation three brothers and one sister out of 
seven children had the disease three in this group underwent joint 
replacement surgery and in the third generation there were five 
with arthritis for some in the family the disease symptoms 
appeared at age 16 
using a tissue sample from one family member with arthritis the 
scientists isolated the collagen ii gene and found that it was 
mutated they then checked that gene in the other family members 
and found it was defective in the nine who were affected with 
arthritis but not in 10 others 
tests were conducted on 57 unrelated individuals without 
arthritis and the defective gene was not found 
prockop said it is now possible to identify the gene from tissue 
samples within four weeks and his laboratory hopes to develop tests 
that can make a genetic diagnosis within two days this would 
enable members of a family where arthritis is common to determine 
if they are susceptible to the disease 
moskowitz said that in expanded studies 10 families with several 
generations of arthritis have been examined and the faulty gene has 
been found in three of the groups this suggests that the gene 
found in the ohio family is not the only one underlying arthritis 
john d stobo a johns hopkins university medical professor who 
is president of the american college of rheumatologists said the 
discovery provides real hope that a cure will be forthcoming 
dr arthur i grayzel senior vice president of the arthritis 
foundation said the new research has the potential for helping 
change the concept of osteoarthritis from a disease that is the 
inevitable consequence of aging to a disease that has a specific 
cause in different people 
the research was supported in part by national institute of 
arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases one of the 
national institutes of health

fired a toy air gun in the direction of the captain 
the captain then admonished the boy telling him not to aim the 
gun at anyone

smiling at the boy the boy recocked the air gun and fired a shot 
at the captains chest

president bush has flown the equivalent of 
eight times around the globe in his 20 months as president 
starting this week hell be able to make the circuit without even 
having to stop 
the president who has traveled farther and more frequently than 
any other chief executives at comparable points in their terms 17 
countries and 40 states as president so far will get the ideal 
accompanying piece of hardware a plane capable of staying aloft a 
week or more through midair refueling 
although nearly two years behind schedule the new air force one 
takes flight this week 
bush a former navy pilot is expected to take his maiden flight 
on the new plane a converted jumbo boeing 747 on thursday when 
he gives speeches for republican candidates in topeka kan and 
tallahassee fla 
then he will use it this weekend when he flies to helsinki 
finland for his oneday summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
while midair refueling is an option to be reserved for an 
emergency the new plane can fly 7140 miles without refueling 
thats 1400 miles farther than the present air force one a 
20yearold boeing 707 
it also carries stateoftheart communications systems an 
antimissile system collisionavoidance equipment and is designed 
to protect electronic systems after a nuclear explosion 
the new plane also has 
eightyfive telephones 
twin beds in the presidents stateroom a changing room and a 
shower 
a builtin movie screen and projection systems 
refrigeratorfreezers that can hold a weeks supply of food 
for 70 passengers and 23 crew members 
a private office for the president with eight large chairs and 
a sofa 
seven lavatories 
a medical emergency room 
two copying machines and television videocassette and stereo 
systems 
although the plane originally was intended to be ready for 
president reagans return trip to california in january 1989 it 
seems more madetoorder for bush 
what other president would expect to take in both kansas and 
florida and call it a day trip for instance or fly to finland for 
lunch 
look out world here we come bushs press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said in announcing that the new plane was ready 
the new air force one and an identical backup plane to be 
delivered in june 1991 were built by boeing at everett wash 
and spent most of the past three years at boeings plant in 
wichita kan for outfitting 
boeing officials are expected to be on hand when the plane 
touches down in topeka on thursday on its inaugural flight 
barring any unforeseen complications that would delay use of the 
plane its maiden flight will be a kind of triumphant return to 
kansas its birthplace fitzwater said 
progress on the planes was delayed nearly two years primarily by 
boeings efforts to equip the plane with wiring that could 
withstand a nuclear blast boeing officials have said 
the new plane has about twice as much wiring 126 million feet 
as a commercial 747 
boeing signed a fixedcost contract with the us air force to 
deliver both planes for 250 million although the price later was 
revised to about 266 million actual costs rose to close to 400 
million air force officials have said with much of the overrun 
being absorbed by boeing 
the larger planes also required construction of a new hangar at 
andrews air force base in the maryland suburbs of washington 
the designation air force one does not relate to a specific 
plane but rather to whatever plane the president is riding on 
when he takes a small gulfstream as he sometimes does on the way 
to camp david md that becomes air force one 
the first air force one was a fourengine pistonpowered 
dc4 flown by franklin roosevelt in 1942 and dubbed sacred cow 
the new 747 will replace the current 707 air force no 2700 
that is primarily used as air force one 
the second plane will replace the backup 707 now used for 
presidential travel air force no 2600 on which lyndon johnson 
took the oath of office on nov 22 1963 
that plane which bush uses occasionally is the first jet ever 
used by a president

the biggest payola case since the scandal 
that ruined the careers of some of rock n rolls top disc jockeys 
30 years ago has been thrown out by a judge who ruled prosecutors 
deliberately withheld evidence 
us district judge james ideman on tuesday dismissed payola and 
racketeering charges against independent record promoter joseph 
isgro 43 citing outrageous government misconduct the trial 
began aug 21 
assistant us attorney william lynch said he will appeal 
isgro was on trial on 57 counts of tax fraud racketeering and 
other charges he was accused of paying cash and cocaine to radio 
stations in texas and california in return for playing certain 
songs 
the trial had featured testimony about cash and drugs stuffed 
into album jackets and audio cassette cases delivered to radio 
station executives 
ideman said prosecutors deliberately withheld from the defense 
contradictory statements by a key witness dennis di ricco a 
former internal revenue service agent convicted of tax conspiracy 
and obstruction in 1989 
prosecutors had earlier denied hiding the testimony 
having been caught with a smoking pistol the government 
which denied it had a pistol then denied that the pistol smoked 
the judge said 
he declared a mistrial and dismissed the indictment he also 
threw out the case against isgros codefendants cocaine dealer 
jeffrey monka 32 and former columbia records executive raymond 
anderson 50 
the government was willing to win at all costs and it got its 
hand caught in the cookie jar said defense attorney don re 
the defense had discovered that di ricco at his trial denied 
involvement in payola with isgro contradicting what he told the 
grand jury that indicted isgro 
isgro said he was relieved and happy the trial was over 
isgros clients included columbia mca warner brothers rca and 
polygram records 
a 1960 federal law made it a crime punishable by a 10000 fine 
and up to a year in prison to offer money or other inducements to 
give records airplay 
the law followed a scandal that rocked the music industry in the 
late 1950s and early 60s the scandal led to congressional 
hearings into the thenwidespread practice of offering djs 
inducements to give certain records airplay 
among those called to testify were dick clark of american 
bandstand and alan freed who is credited with inventing the term 
rock n roll 
the investigation cost the careers of several top disc jockeys 
of the era

american indian leaders want congress to 
approve a memorial to the warriors who fell at little big horn and 
virginia officials are urging a national commission to help 
preserve civil war battlefields 
we need to honor our warriors who gave their lives carol 
gipp of the national congress of american indians told the house 
interior committees subcommittee on national parks and public 
lands 
the appeal came tuesday as indians conservationists and others 
crowded the hearing room to plead for approval of favorite bills 
before congress adjourns next month 
a memorial to the warriors who fell in the 1876 victory of the 
sioux over lt col george custer and a detachment of the 7th 
cavalry regiment would cost about 21 million the national park 
service has estimated the service is supporting the memorial as 
yet undesigned 
the memorial would be adjacent to the monument to the 7th 
cavalry which was erected on last stand hill on the montana 
battlefield in 1881 it bears the full names of custer and each of 
the 224 other men in his command 
virginia officials and historic preservationists urged approval 
of a national commission on civil war battlefields to help shield a 
number of sites from development as the suburbs outside the 
nations capital spread southward 
mayor elizabeth g helm of winchester pointed to estimates that 
employment in the dulles corridor outside washington would grow 
more than 1000 percent and the homes of those joining the labor 
force most likely would be in central maryland and the northern 
shenandoah valley 
this same area is heavily steeped in history and tradition but 
we have tended to take this heritage for granted she said we 
have assumed that it will always be with us for future 
generations

a congressman and a team of 
researchers plan to visit christie brinkley to see if the cover 
girl has figured out a way to fight lyme disease 
brinkley believes the guinea hens she is raising are eating the 
deer ticks on the long island estate she shares with her husband 
singer billy joel the ticks carry lyme disease which causes a 
variety of symptoms and can be fatal 
rep george hochbrueckner quickly seized the photo opportunity 
when brinkley told the democrat the tick population dropped after 
she let the hens wander 
he said researchers will study whether the birds can tell the 
difference between dog ticks and deer ticks they will also try to 
determine if the deer tick population is lower on the celebrity 
property than at neighbors homes 
the hens are used in africa to keep ticks out of barnyards

an effort is under way to get people in the 
iron city to stop eating like steelworkers 
the state has joined 100 companies and two drug store chains in 
sponsoring the pittsburgh community health challenge which will 
offer some 52000 workers and other members of the public a 10week 
analysis of their eating habits 
organizers hope to turn people away from an arteryclogging 
legacy of pirogies kielbasa gyros and other highfat ethnic 
dishes that sustained generations of robust steelworkers 
our parents developed highfat kinds of foods when they were 
working in the steel mills said donna donati the programs 
executive director they used to work very hard burn those 
calories off 
but were eating the same foods they ate when they hung their 
clothes outside on the line rather than what we do sitting around 
as they dry in the dryer 
the city once dependent on steel has created service 
hightech and medical jobs since the decline of the mills in the 
early 1980s 
supporters of the program dined on lowfat quiche and cheesecake 
at a tuesday lunch to unveil the effort aimed at curbing the citys 
appetite for foods loaded with saturated fats and cholesterol both 
linked to heart disease 
questionnaires about family medical history smoking exercise 
and diet will be handed out the participating companies including 
ppg industries inc hj heinz co and allegheny ludlum corp 
among the areas largest employers 
thrift drugs and legend pharmacies will distribute 
questionnaires at their stores 
a computer analysis will tell respondents how they compare to 
average americans in the risk of heart disease 
its really personal it will hit them right on the head 
ms donati said 
pennsylvania had 2668 heart disease deaths per 100000 people 
in 1986 the most recent year available said dr lewis kuller of 
the university of pittsburghs school of public health the 
national average was 2468 deaths per 100000 
most southwestern pennsylvania residents are ignorant of the 
dangers of cholesterol and fat researchers said 
most of them dont have the foggiest idea what theyre doing 
to themselves kuller said its so simple too people can 
reduce cholesterol in their food through simple changes and 
substitutions 
organizers said doctors dont tell their patients enough about 
the importance of diet 
most doctors are poorly educated in nutrition said pitts 
dr trevor orchard they dont have time to spend giving 
nutrition counseling even if they did know what they are talking 
about 
the physicians should be provided with the names of foods that 
are low in fat or cholesterol as the drug companies have been 
doing for years said christian chavanne executive chef at 
galaxy cheese co 
the company makes formagg a cheese of skim milk and soybean and 
canola oils that was featured in pizza quiche and chicken at 
tuesdays lunch 
chavanne said watching fat content doesnt mean you cant have 
that occasional binge or splurge once in awhile the tbone steak 
every three weeks if youve been good

britains middle east empire is long gone but 
londons strong political and defense ties in the region have given 
it a highprofile role in the persian gulf crisis 
britain helped draw the current map of the middle east after 
world war i and was deeply involved in governing many countries in 
the region including both iraq and kuwait 
last month it was the first power to send weapons in support of 
the us buildup in the region and last weekend prime minister 
margaret thatcher bore the brunt of iraqi invective over the wests 
military challenge to its invasion of kuwait 
mrs thatcher accused president saddam hussein of iraq of having 
hidden behind the skirts of women and children and the iraqi 
news agency denounced her as an old hag 
thatcher would do well to bear in mind that the empire on 
whose possessions the sun did not go down has long been defunct 
and neither she nor any of her allies will be able to set the clock 
back it said 
dr basim musallam director of the center of mideast studies at 
cambridge university says the historical background has made 
britains role in the persian gulf bigger than the number of 
planes it has sent 
britain sells sophisticated military hardware to the gulf 
states and british officers help train their soldiers and pilots 
in 1988 britain signed its biggest arms deal ever to sell 
saudi arabia nearly 20 billion worth of warplanes 
britain was the last imperial power to withdraw from the 
gulf musallam said in an interview the british know the 
terrain very well they have close connections with the local 
rulers much more than the french or americans 
originally britain needed the middle east to shut out russia and 
germany and secure its routes to the orient and it ruled arabia 
from india until after world war i 
the seven sheikdoms which now comprise the united arab emirates 
and kuwait gave britain control of foreign affairs and defense in 
the late 19th century bahrain was a british protectorate from 1861 
until 1971 
a romantic angloarab tradition developed personified by such 
figures as lawrence of arabia 
oil changed britains interest in the middle east the royal 
navy switched to oil in 1912 just as the anglopersian oil company 
which is now british petroleum started operations in persia now 
iran 
having defeated the ottoman empire in world war i britain and 
france drew new mideast boundaries france got lebanon and syria 
britain got iraq transjordan now jordan and palestine 
britain installed friendly arab rulers who were more or less 
amenable to british protection a situation which survived more or 
less until the late 1930s according to oxford university 
historian alastair parker 
then came more changes oil was struck in saudi arabia and the 
americans moved into the middle east for the first time meanwhile 
the jews were demanding a state in palestine 
britain was torn and in 1939 it opted for a proarab policy 
after world war ii the british empire began to wane but 
londons interests in the middle east remained paramount in 1956 
it joined france in trying to seize the suez canal from the 
egyptian nationalist leader gamal abdel nasser in the early 1960s 
it sent troops to ward off threats in the persian gulf and adan in 
presentday yemen 
prof john vincent a middle east historian at the university of 
bristol says iraq shouldnt be surprised by britains response to 
the kuwait invasion we are sticking to precedent he said in 
an interview this is what weve always done 
our interest has stayed the same down the ages he said 
we want a balanced strong independent middle east which isnt 
under the thumb of any great powers and which isnt under a 
regional dictator 
columnist robert harris mused in the sunday times at the 
reversal in us and british roles 
for half a century after world war i american foreign policy 
was dominated by a desire to break up the british empire that 
policy succeeded perhaps too well he wrote 
now as washingtons gunboats are required to steam along our 
old imperial routes to the gulf one cannot help but smile

gov bob miller crushed five democratic 
challengers tuesday in his bid for a full term in the job he 
inherited two years ago businessman jim gallaway won an eightway 
race for the republican nomination 
miller moved up automatically from the lieutenant governors 
post after gov dick bryan was elected to the us senate in 1988 
with onethird of precincts reporting miller had 41294 votes 
or 80 percent the next most popular choice of voters was none of 
the above which appears on all nevada ballots with 4100 
votes or 9 percent a longshot hopeful who changed his name to 
rhinestone cowboy was running third with 1540 votes 
in the gop race gallaway had 23146 votes or 49 percent 
none of the above drew 10585 votes or 24 percent and builder 
charlie brown had 9221 votes 
gallaway a relative newcomer to the state said miller had 
shown a total lack of leadership as governor gallaway was 
accused by brown of trying to buy the election with slick 
television ads gallaway outspent brown by 4to1 
a poll conducted for the nevada retailers association in august 
looked at the likely matchup in november and found miller trouncing 
gallaway 60 percent to 27 percent the polls margin of error was 4 
percentage points 
but gallaway hoped to gain support from two issues he favors 
abortion rights and opposes a statewide payroll tax plan while 
miller is antiabortion and backs the tax 
in a bizarre contest the name of late assemblyman marvin 
sedway a las vegas democrat was listed on the ballot in the 
district 15 assembly contest he died in july of lung cancer too 
late to have his name removed the ballot also included political 
unknown charles wakefield 
sedways widow kim expressed interest in the job but too late 
to get on the ballot she hoped sedway would win the primary and 
the county democratic committee would then pick her as its 
candidate if so she would face republican bob wong in november 
a plane crash monday seriously injured two candidates in the gop 
primary sue wagner running for lieutenant governor and bob 
seale who is running for treasurer seales wife judy was killed 
in the crash authorities said both held substantial leads 
five people were aboard the twinengine plane that crashed after 
takeoff from fallon for a labor day parade in carson city two 
aides to the candidates suffered less serious injuries and were 
taken to a hospital authorities said

in an outpouring of emotion tens of 
thousands of chileans lined the streets to view the casket of 
toppled marxist president salvador allende whose remains were 
unearthed from a humble grave for an honorable burial 
tuesdays solemn ceremony organized by the new democratic 
government came 17 years after allendes death in a bloody 
military coup 
the military was conspicuously absent from the ceremonies gen 
augusto pinochet led the coup against allende and still heads the 
armed forces 
the day was chosen because it marked 20 years since allende 
became the western hemispheres first freely elected marxist 
president 
as the crowd dispersed after the observances riot police 
blocked small groups who attempted to march to the city center 
interior minister enrique kraus said 92 people were detained in 
sporadic clashes with police in santiago and five in vina del mar 
but all were released three hours later santiago was reported calm 
at dusk 
the official observances were marked by appeals to preserve 
chiles newly restored democratic rule 
we express our will to favor the future of our country which 
demands from us to unite beyond the disputes that separated us in 
the past president patricio aylwin said in a speech at the 
cemetery 
allendes remains which had been buried outside the capital 
were placed in a marble mausoleum at santiagos main cemetery 
where other chilean presidents and dignitaries are buried 
aylwin an elected civilian who was a political foe of allende 
succeeded pinochet in march putting an end to 16 years of 
authoritarian military rule 
allende died during an attack on his presidential palace on 
sept 11 1973 the military said he committed suicide rather than 
surrender 
allendes remains were unearthed early in the day from a modest 
family tomb in vina del mar in santiago thousands of people lined 
the streets to view the flagdraped coffin 
the procession drove the presidential palace the catholic 
cathedral and finally the capitals main cemetery 
rightwing politicians said the ceremony was a bid to gain 
political advantage for the government and the left 
but the government said the reburial was repairing an 
unjustice toward a man who was a legitimate president of chile 
aylwin was booed when he recalled in his speech that he had 
opposed the allende government 
raising his voice the 71yearold president replied to those 
who are booing i say the only language that will allow us to 
understand each to other is the language of truth 
the horror and suffering that chile has gone through should 
never happen again he continued its a task for all chileans 
to prevent it and we will be able to do so only if we reject 
hatred and violence 
allendes widow hortensia bussi said tuesdays ceremonies 
should be seen as a contribution to reconciliation 
french prime minister michel rocard speaking on behalf of 
foreign dignitaries attending the ceremony stressed the importance 
of preserving democracy 
he said restoration of democracy in chile shows that freedom 
can be momentarily supressed but it can never be defeated 
security around the ceremonies was tight 
four bombs went off overnight in santiago causing minor damage 
to two military monuments and two shops but no injuries a 
rightwing group claimed responsibility

the new york post is losing 25 million a year 
and could close unless its unions agree to costcutting measures 
union and management representatives say 
post general manager richard t nasti said after a meeting with 
leaders of the papers 10 unions tuesday that the paper has set 
sept 15 as a deadline for reaching agreement he added that he is 
optimistic the deadline will be met 
nasti said there is a 25 million annual gap that must be 
filled to allow publisher peter kalikow to continue publishing 
the paper but in a statement he did not say what would happen 
if the deadline were not met 
theodore kheel a labor mediator and adviser to the unions 
allied printing trades council who was at the meeting said it was 
his understanding that if they are not able to reach agreement 
with the unions on savings of some 17 million they would suspend 
publication and give employees a 60day notice 
kheel said workers would be paid during the 60 days but the 
paper could cease publication immediately on sept 15 
he said 17 million is the amount the post hopes to save through 
costcutting measures affecting its unions with the rest to be 
made up in other ways 
the allied is an umbrella group for the 10 unions representing 
900 employees at the post which is the nations oldest daily the 
tabloid founded in 1801 has a circulation of 505000 behind the 
daily news and the new york times 
the post offered to open its books to its unions and meetings 
were scheduled for today and thursday to discuss costcutting 
proposals 
kalikow bought the post from rupert murdoch in 1988 when the 
paper was losing about 3 million a month concessions from the 
unions were part of the package that murdoch had to achieve to meet 
kalikows terms 
the unions also are involved in negotiations with the daily news 
over costsaving measures the newspaper says are crucial to its 
survival

federal scientists have concluded a controversial 
bloodheating treatment for aids did nothing to help two us 
patients 
the team of researchers from the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases also said the hyperthermia treatment a 
technique to raise body temperature and kill the aids virus should 
not be repeated 
dr kenneth alonso who helped pioneer the technique charged 
that the report was replete with errors and merely an attempt 
to discredit his work 
apparently any work which does not fit your thesis is 
ignored alonso said in a letter to dr lawrence deyton niaid 
assistant director for community and head of the investigative 
team the letter was released on tuesday 
a summary of the investigative teams findings released tuesday 
by the niaid said hyperthermia as applied in these cases 
appears to have offered no clinical immunologic or virologic 
benefits to these two patients 
niaid reported that the two patients still were infected by the 
aids virus 
there does not appear any support for further human 
experimentation in this area at this time the summary concluded 
the institutes report is the harshest official criticism yet of 
the treatment which offered hope to thousands of aids sufferers 
earlier this year after one patient pronounced himself cured 
niaid researchers visited alonso at his request july 25 to learn 
about his technique which had been performed in the united states 
on two patients infected with the virus a third man reportedly a 
very ill aids patient from new york received the treatment from 
alonso in mexico and died hours later 
the first patient 33yearold carl crawford reported dramatic 
improvements in his kaposis sarcoma a skin cancer afflicting many 
aids patients he went so far as to tell reporters he had been 
cured of aids 
but tests showed no evidence the man had kaposis sarcoma the 
niaid reported the researchers suggested crawfords skin problems 
resulted from an infection from cat scratches that was cleared up 
by antibiotics 
alonso called that conclusion absurd 
the second patient a 38yearold with advanced aids whose 
identity was kept confidential reported little or no improvement 
after hyperthermia according to the niaid report alonso disputed 
those findings as well 
hyperthermia commonly used to treat infections before the 
advent of antibiotics is still used against some cancers 
in the procedure developed by alonso and his former partner dr 
william logan the patients blood was run through a heater and 
back into the body to raise body temperature 
the niaid report however noted that some researchers have 
reported that heat can actually increase the aids virus

breakfast is a banana apple orange or an mre 
mealreadytoeat frankfurters are the favorite

headed for the days practice battle positions and maneuvers until 
noon 
at 7 am its 85 degrees an hour later its 97 by noon its 
approaching 120 degrees and the heavy guns crawl under camouflage

heavy gun trio sometimes get up a football game 
after 5 pm its time for more maneuvers and then a stop for 
dinner sometime after the eagerly awaited sunset

flip it over every 3 seconds said 1st lt ron ainslie the 
platoon commander 
it gets pretty hot said ainslie a 28yearold from

police fatally shot six students 
protesting plans to give more jobs to lowcaste hindus and growing 
violence prompted the government today to cancel bus service 
linking new delhi with state capitals 
the buses were canceled to avoid clashes and attacks on 
stateowned buses during a 50hour strike beginning thursday that 
students have called 
they are protesting prime minister vp singhs proposal to 
reserve half of all government jobs for lower castes 
thousands of passengers were stranded at new delhis inter state 
bus terminus today at least 25000 people a day normally travel on 
buses from the station the largest in india 
said a transport official at the bus terminal we are running 
only those limited services which can return to the depot by this 
evening 
police in bihar indias poorest state opened fire on students 
tuesday killing at least six people and wounding 50 news reports 
said the violence raises to 14 the number of people killed in four 
weeks of street protests against singhs decision 
the statesman newspaper said students had set numerous cars on 
fire and attempted to storm the government secretariat in patna 
the capital of the eastern state of bihar 
indian express a new delhibased newspaper said groups of 
students planned to block all traffic on the streets of the capital 
when the strike begins thursday 
an organization of uppercaste farmers that commands wide 
support in areas around new delhi has pledged support and said its 
members will block all roads leading to the city 
prime minister singh announced aug 7 that 49 percent of 
government jobs would be reserved on the basis of caste up from a 
previous 22 percent in addition 5 to 10 percent of jobs would be 
reserved for poor people regardless of caste and the rest would be 
awarded on merit he said 
the proposal raised a storm of protest the government employs 
18 million people and a whitecollar job is muchsought by 
graduating students 
opponents said singh was attempting to buy votes from the lower 
castes who form a majority of indias 880 million people 
the chief opposition party the congress party of previous prime 
minister rajiv gandhi has dismissed the proposals as politically 
motivated 
media criticism has also been fierce the biweekly india today 
magazine said tuesday that the decision marked the descent of 
singh from leader to demagogue 
he has been reduced to a votehungry power broker 
shamelessly using the two elements which have ever bloodied and 
divided this nation religion and caste the news magazine said 
hindus who make up 82 percent of the countrys people are 
divided into four main castes and hundreds of subcastes 
discrimination on the basis of caste is legally banned but in 
reality the system permeates much of indian life especially in 
rural areas

intelsat the international satellite consortium 
is suing titan rocket builder martin marietta corp for 400 
million over the botched launch of a 145 million communications 
satellite now stuck in a useless orbit 
in the lawsuit filed tuesday in federal court in baltimore 
intelsat charged that martin marietta miswired the rocket then 
gave false assurances of its quality before the march 14 launch 
for which intelsat paid 115 million 
martin marietta has said a wiring problem caused failure of the 
satellite and its attached booster rocket to separate from the 
titan when they reached orbit 
as a result the uninsured satellite fell short of its station 
22300 miles above earth and will be a total loss unless it gets a 
boost a shuttle crew will try to rescue it next year at a cost to 
intelsat of about 90 million 
intelsat claimed martin marietta didnt take proper steps to 
detect the flaw and failed to properly analyze test data or 
supervise crews that built the rocket 
elliott miller martin marietta director of corporate relations 
said the lawsuit had no merit and that intelsat had declined to buy 
insurance 
under the launch services contract between martin marietta and 
intelsat the relationship of the parties for risk of loss is 
clearly set forth he said the contract provides that martin 
marietta is not liable for the satellite failure to achieve orbit 
martin marietta based in bethesda md built the rocket near 
denver 
the aerospace company attempted a preemptive strike against 
intelsat in july asking the federal court to declare that its only 
legal responsibility was to provide a replacement launch martin 
marietta said it might have to go out of the commercial launch 
business if it were made to pay damages 
but in its lawsuit intelsat noted that martin marietta was 
considering dropping out anyway

thousands of ragged asian refugees 
who fled iraq and kuwait are battling for starvation rations in 
this squalid desert camp the united nations is desperately 
appealing for international help 
thousands pushed and scuffled among themselves tuesday next to a 
large trailer truck from which jordanian officials were trying to 
distribute food a round piece of flat arab bread one tomato and 
one small cucumber per person 
the commotion and the disorder was so great that the dozen or so 
jordanian soldiers on duty stripped off their belts and started 
flailing the ragged refugees yelling at them to stop fighting and 
get into line 
but again and again as soon as some order was restored the 
thousands at the back surged forward screaming for their share of 
the meager rations before they ran out 
there were slightly less chaotic scenes at scattered points in 
the vast desert camp when half a dozen tanker trucks arrived to 
distribute water 
we are fighting because we are hungry and thirsty tell 
the world we are going to die here if we are not helped ahmed 
saed a whitebearded pakistani pleaded with reporters visiting 
the camp near the iraqi border 
it is not easy to control people who are hungry and thirsty 
said suleyman bakr one of five jordanian doctors manning a first 
aid tent 
we need more food more water and better organization but 
whats needed more than anything is to get these people to their 
countries as soon as possible he said 
the makeshift camp at ruweishid is regarded as the most 
desperate area in jordan for evacuees who have arrived from kuwait 
and iraq in the month since iraqi troops overran the oilrich 
emirate 
it is located at shaalan 50 miles inside jordan between the 
ruweishid border post and the iraqi border it houses 40000 mostly 
penniless refugees from bangladesh india pakistan sri lanka the 
philippines and thailand 
many have been stranded for the past two weeks awaiting travel 
arrangements for the journey on to their homelands 
philippine airlines announced today that it has scheduled 21 
flights this month to the jordanian capital of amman to speed up 
the evacuation of stranded filipinos 
rk jenny a senior un official trying to organize a massive 
airlift for the asians announced tuesday that the united nations 
has launched a world appeal to help jordan cope with the massive 
influx 
this is going to be a gigantic problem calling for a gigantic 
response he told a news conference in the capital amman 
jordans crown prince hassan said more than 100000 asians are 
stranded in his country out of the 420000 people who have 
crossed into jordan from iraq and kuwait since aug 7 
the situation may soon become critical he told the news 
conference the plight of these persons has only evoked the 
faintest of responses from the world community and from a world 
press more interested in war scenarios than humanitarian relief 
indeed there has been concern that world attention has been 
focused instead on the betteroff westerners being held by the 
iraqis and their quest to get out 
in amman later tuesday jordans americanborn queen noor 
embraced and kissed british millionaire richard branson when he 
flew in aboard a 747 jumbo jet of his virgin atlantic airline with 
30 tons of food for the stranded asians 
we are so grateful we desperately need all this the queen 
told branson as she pointed at the sacks of wheat slung on top of 
the scarlet first class seats of the jet 
we will get this to the really desperate areas and this action 
you have done is a tremendous help the queen added 
branson said he was worried more about the plight of the 
stranded asian and arab refugees than of the westerners trying to 
leave areas under iraqi control 
what we are doing is only a pittance he said children 
and old people are dying we need a massive airlift and ships 
this is something the united nations should do 
one bangladeshi in ruweishid said his embassy in kuwait 
advised us to leave after the iraqi invasion to avoid being 
killed if war broke out with america 
but it would have been better to stay in iraq and face death 
there rather than die in this terrible stink hole in the desert

chancellor helmut kohl plans to name 
four leading east germans to his cabinet to help deal with the 
massive problems of their people when the two germanys merge next 
month government sources said today 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere is a top candidate 
for a cabinet post said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
in east berlin today officials said the number of east germans 
either unemployed or working shorter hours at lower pay jumped to 
nearly 2 million of the 88 million workers last month 
the central labor office said 361286 east germans were without 
jobs last month up by 86269 from the end of july the jobless 
rate went from 31 percent to 41 percent 
that compares with a 16 percent rate at the end of june just 
before east germany converted to a free market economy on july 1 
after four decades of socialism 
many factories and businesses no longer subsidized are having 
difficulty competing with more efficient western enterprises that 
now have access to the east german market electronics textiles 
automotive and agricultural industries are among the hardest hit 
the number of workers who came under a west germanfinanced 
program fighting the rise in unemployment was up to 1439412 more 
than double the 656277 in july 
the workers under this program would have been laid off but are 
being kept on payrolls at shorter hours and lower pay subsidized by 
west germany 
critics say these workers some of whom are making only a small 
amount over the unemployment rate and not actually doing any work 
should be counted among the jobless 
government sources in bonn said today that as part of kohls 
plans for an interim government for a united germany the chancellor 
will be adding four east german officials to his cabinet 
east germany and its government will cease to exist on oct 3 
the chosen day of unity 
the four new ministers will help kohl govern what is now east 
germany between the day of unity and dec 2 when an allgerman 
parliament will be elected said the sources 
they said that along with de maiziere other top candidates are 
guenther krause de maizieres leading unity negotiatior sabine 
bergmannpohl president of the east german parliament and rainer 
ortleb head of the east german free democrats 
the four new cabinet members would be ministers without 
portfolios said the sources 
west german radio said the four new ministers would act as 
intermediaries between kohls government and east germanys five 
soontoberecreated states 
east germany will also have parliamentary representation in the 
interim period between unity and allgerman elections 
the two germanys have agreed 144 east german lawmakers will have 
seats in the west german parliament after unity 
the major east german parties are choosing the 144 on the basis 
of the current balance of power within the east german parliament 
which will be dissolved when unity comes

japan loaded a ship with 800 fourwheeldrive 
vehicles for the usled multinational force in the persian gulf 
but a seamens union held up todays planned departure because of 
the war danger 
the 11 million in cargo japans first installment of the 1 
billion it has promised in aid for the effort against iraq also 
included an unspecified number of water trucks and air conditioners 
negotiations between the government and the all japan seamens 
association continued into the evening and it was unclear when the 
ship would set sail from the central port of nagoya the union said 
its members should not be forced to sail into the tense gulf region 
the panamaregistered sea venus owned by kawasaki kisen co 
ltd would take about three weeks to get to the gulf region the 
ships agent said in a telephone interview 
the vehicles are expected to be used by military staff in the 
multinational forces assembled in saudi arabia said a foreign 
ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the shipment is part of the assistance package announced last 
week by prime minister toshiki kaifu it is to include 100 medical 
personnel and chartered civil aircraft and ships that will 
transport food water and medical supplies ship as well as other 
nonmilitary goods 
kaifu has ruled out a direct role for japans military citing 
the constitutional prohibition against the use of force in settling 
international disputes 
the foreign ministry official declined to say when further 
shipments were to be made but japan has said prefabricated 
housing refrigerators and power generators would likely be sent 
kuwait today joined washington in urging japan to make a greater 
contribution 
i would have wished japan to have done more sheikh ali al 
khalifa al athbi alsabah finance minister of the kuwaiti 
government in exile told reporters in tokyo 
but he added that persuading japan to contribute more should be 
done very softly considering their circumstances 
us treasury secretary nicholas brady is to stop briefly in 
tokyo on friday to explain to kaifu and other japanese officials 
what kind of further assistance washington is seeking 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe on tuesday dismissed 
criticism that the aid package did not go far enough saying it was 
a rather sizable amount 
he also said japanese corporations will be asked to divert 
existing stock to the assistance package and sell their products to 
the government at cost 
toyota spokesman yoshiharu tateishi would not say what losses 
the company might incur but said providing vehicles for the 
persian gulf force would delay supplies 
our productivity is not capable to cover the losses because 
the domestic demand is already quite high he said

pope john paul ii ended his fiveday 
pilgrimage to tanzania today by celebrating mass at the foot of 
mount kilimanjaro and imploring rich countries to forge a new era 
of solidarity with africa 
let the world not forget the urgent needs of the peoples of 
africa the pope said before flying to the central african 
country of burundi the second leg of his 10day fournation tour 
john paul making his seventh trip to africa said he was 
pleased with the growth of the roman catholic church in tanzania 
but he could not ignore that millions of africans continue to live 
in poverty 
i implore gods gifts of comfort strength and peace upon 
those who suffer or are in need on this continent he said in a 
departure speech in the name of our common humanity i appeal to 
the more developed nations of the earth to inaugurate a new era of 
solidarity with africa based on justice and respect 
earlier today about 40000 people attended the popes mass in 
kilimanjaro stadium a former cricket and polo grounds of british 
rulers 
when john paul arrived the 19300foot snowy peak of africas 
tallest mountain broke through clouds that obscured it much of the 
morning 
in his homily the pontiff paid tribute to the missionaries who 
brought christianity to northern tanzania 100 years ago 
the many saints and martyrs of the young african churches show 
that what has been handed on since apostolic times need not be 
watered down in order to penetrate the rich soil of africa he 
said the heroic response to the demands of conversion and the 
challenge of martyrdom constitutes a glorious page in the history 
of your particular churches 
the pope encouraged his flock to practice their faith in an 
authentically african way by incorporating their customs culture 
and traditions in the church 
by illuminating and purifying these elements of local life 
with the gospel and bringing them into catholic unity the whole 
church is marvelously enriched he said 
the pope has urged roman catholics to shun such practices as 
witchcraft and polygamy stressing that the basic tenets of the 
faith cannot be compromised 
among the gifts for the pope was a stuffed lion brought to the 
edge of the altar on the back of a pickup truck by a masai moran 
or warrior dressed in the tribes traditional togalike robe of 
red and blue 
to mark the popes visit members of the mount kilimanjaro

the rival koreas today held their 
highest level meeting to date and north korea demanded that south 
korea immediately release jailed dissidents and halt a joint 
military exercise with the united states 
for its part south korea proposed mutual recognition free 
travel and gradual arms reduction the communist north and 
capitalist south never formally recognized each other after the 
division of korea in 1945 
across town about 1000 radical students yelling us troops 
get out hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police who blocked 
them from marching off the campus at seoul national university and 
fired tear gas to disperse them 
several people were injured and at least five students were 
arrested 
south korean prime minister kang younghoon the first to speak 
at the opening session had no opportunity to respond directly to 
the demands of the communist north but the seoul government has 
already said that the issues are internal matters 
the north also demanded that south korea cease efforts to seek a 
seat in the united nations saying that would perpetuate the 
division of the peninsula 
after each side made its statement the formal meeting was 
adjourned as scheduled a second meeting was to be held thursday 
behind closed doors 
it was unclear whether the future of the talks would be 
jeopardized by the norths demands but north korean prime minister 
yon hyong muk strongly indicated that progress in other areas would 
be unlikely unless the demands were met he stopped short of 
calling them conditions 
we view these as very urgent very serious matters 
directly connected with the future fate of this conference the 
north korean premier said 
the south opened the talks with a proposal based on its 
conviction that mutual confidencebuilding measures must precede 
unification talks 
north korea has taken the view that confidence between the two 
sides will come only after arms cuts and unification are complete 
should the authorities of both sides persist in 
confrontational and hostile attitudes interkorean relations will 
never be improved kang said 
the south korean prime minister said cooperation between the two 
sides should include free travel across the border during major 
holidays economic and trade cooperation and the reconnection of 
railroad highway mail and telephone service lines 
kang also proposed that the two governments work jointly to 
locate family members separated by the threeyear korean war in the 
early 1950s an estimated 10 million koreans were separated from 
family members during the conflict 
on arms reduction kang said the two sides should agree to equal 
numbers of troops and weapons currently the north has about 11 
million troops and the south has 650000 and the support of 43000 
us troops stationed in south korea 
kang said international safeguards for peace on the peninsula 
should involve not only the two koreas but interested foreign 
powers including the soviet union china japan and the united 
states 
south korean observers have been careful to point out that the 
talks that began today are meant to be a significant first step in 
a long process of dialogue which eventually may lead to unification 
a peace treaty was never signed after the korean war 
the north korean delegation is only the third to visit the south 
in more than 40 years the 90member delegation crossed the border 
tuesday for a fourday visit 
the talks opened promptly this morning with the sevenmember 
official delegations of both sides facing one another across a 
rectangular table 
the north korean premier wearing a badge depicting north korean 
communist party leader kim il sung waved briefly to onlookers and 
took his seat at the north side of the table the south korean 
premier sat on the south side 
the premiers smiled broadly and shook hands across the table 
when photographers yelled for them to repeat the action they stood 
for about a minute clasping hands 
the north korean delegation was staying at a luxury hotel where 
they could tune into american television enjoy a sauna in a posh 
health club and buy german and french magazines 
the south korean government was picking up the tab

students watched videotaped lessons that a 
teachers union official called hightech scabbing during a 
strike that lasted only one day before negotiators reached a 
tentative settlement early today 
teachers were expected to vote this morning on the settlement 
offer which was made about 230 am after nearly 6 hours of 
talks said melanie mitchell president of the yakima education 
association ratification was expected to be a formality 
details of the offer were not immediately available but 
mitchell said it gives teachers more say over the method of 
classroom instruction sets limits on class size and addresses 
teacher evaluation concerns 
i think weve achieved a settlement both parties can be 
pleased with she said 
school administrators defended their use of television 
instruction in the 12000pupil district but some teachers and 
students werent impressed 
its a joke said sophomore john williams who walked out of 
an english class tuesday at davis high school to find a skiing 
magazine in the library 
im going home said student carmen espinosa 
but another student brendon curland said it was better to go 
to school because there would be too many distractions trying to 
work at home 
yakimas 709 teachers walked out monday night in a dispute over 
class size pay for extracurricular activities teacher 
evaluations grievance procedures and use of teacher aides 
administrators had recorded video lessons and on tuesday the 
first day of classes showed them in every school while teachers 
walked picket lines outside 
teachers urged parents to keep their children home at davis 
high more than half the 1600 students were in class but many 
classrooms were empty 
students worked with supervision from teacher aides some 
students talked back to the video teachers others sipped soft 
drinks gazed out windows or talked among themselves 
this guy looks cool one student sneered as a lecture on the 
civil war came on the screen 
carolyn wallace of the national education association called the 
televised lessons hightech scabbing 
we have never heard of anything like this ms wallace said 
by telephone from washington dc some districts have shown 
educational films during strikes but never recorded lessons she 
said 
striking teachers questioned the value of the tapes 
its tough to ask a tv a question said roger farnum an 
english teacher at davis 
principal robert mclaughlin said the video lectures follow 
regular lesson plans and that teachers would pick right up from 
them when they return we think this is a quality education this 
is not babysitting he said 
but its not as good as having my instructors here he 
acknowledged 
the tapes were supplemented tuesday by four pages of advertising 
in the local newspaper containing lesson plans and assignments for 
students 
the tapes also were shown over two educational cable tv stations 
controlled by the district and students could do the work from 
home for credit said district spokeswoman rhonda stone 
the district said it would pay to hook up cable for any family 
of a student that didnt have the service and for newspaper 
subscriptions 
administrators began taping the lessons last week at the 
districts tv studio and said they hoped to stay one week ahead in 
the event of a lengthy strike said mclaughlin who is teaching 
economics 
teacher aides who did not strike could oversee classrooms but 
cannot do any teaching said aide lisa baker i make sure they 
are getting their notes down she said 
ms baker said some students asked her to switch channels to 
mtv in another class a boy insisted to an aide that davis students 
were allowed to have soft drinks during class mclaughlin said they 
arent

members of congress are questioning president 
bushs decision to forgive 7 billion in debts from egypt saying 
it could trigger pleas for similar relief and push up the federal 
deficit 
house minority whip newt gingrich rga said congress would 
approve bushs recommendation to reward egypt for helping in the 
persian gulf operation against iraq if egypts participation saves 
the united states substantial money 
if we could avoid spending a substantial amount of money by 
having egyptian soldiers in place of american soldiers there could 
be a tradeoff there gingrich told reporters in atlanta 
i think we would have to look at the other nations that owe us 
a lot also sen john glenn dohio said today on abcs good 
morning america program there are going to be requests from 
others if we do this undoubtedly but he said he thinks there 
will be a lot of support for forgiving egypts debt and it should 
be considered 
its not as expensive ifyou evaluate it in terms of the 
present worth of that debt sen richard lugar rind said on 
the same program a lot of debt reductions occurring around the 
world you take a look at what the world market is for it for 
example 7 billion is in fact worth five cents on the dollar if 
you try to sell it on the open market 
several members of congress said that while they support bushs 
overall policy of holding the line against further aggression by 
iraqi president saddam hussein they are concerned about the 
repercussions of operation desert shield on the already steep 
federal budget deficit 
growing political pressure for a deal between the white house 
and congress to curb federal deficits already had thrown into doubt 
the notion that money saved by the lessening of eastwest tensions 
could amount to a peace dividend to be applied to domestic needs 
in asking congress to approve a deal to write off 7 billion in 
egypts military debt to the united states the white house said 
bush decided on this course of action as a symbol of our 
appreciation for egypts assistance in the gulf operations 
but house minority leader robert michel rill said the move 
may be a little premature he added i would like to hear 
firsthand from the administration the rationale for the decision 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of a senate foreign aid 
panel said the debt forgiveness would lead to similar requests 
from other nations that have suffered economically because of an 
embargo on trade with iraq 
im not willing to double or triple our foreign aid budget 
without a lot more understanding of what the united states gets out 
of it he said 
leahy predicted that such a major step involving egypt would 
trigger similar requests from israel turkey greece the 
philippines morocco pakistan and other nations 
i know its going to be necessary to increase some foreign aid 
dollars as a result of operation desert shield leahy said in an 
interview but he added it looks like some in the administration 
are saying lets have a blank check for foreign aid i want to 
remind them that my subcommittees still got the checkbook 
egypt has an additional 6 billion in nonmilitary debt to the 
united states and that still stands fitzwater said 
he said forgiving the 7 billion debt would mean the us 
treasury would forgo a payment of 750 million this year which 
would have contributed to the efforts to reduce the federal deficit

three western human rights monitors 
probing alleged abuses in the restive kosovo province were detained 
by police ordered out of yugoslavia and barred from the country 
for the next three years diplomats said today 
the diplomats who asked not to be identified said three 
members of the viennabased international helsinki federation were 
detained late tuesday at their hotel in prizren a kosovo town 
close to the border with neighboring albania 
the three were ordered out of yugoslavia within 24 hours and had 
their passports stamped to bar them from the country for three 
years according to the diplomats and lisa lotteleicht a group 
spokeswoman in vienna 
a dutchman in the delegation identified as barend cohen told 
his embassy in belgrade the group also had all its work documents 
confiscated lotteleicht said 
the police action followed increasingly critical reports by the 
group on the human rights situation in kosovo an ancient serbian 
province now dominated by ethnic albanians 
the serbs have taken full adminstrative control of the province 
arguing this is necessary to protect the slav minority from alleged 
ethnic albanian harassment 
more than 60 ethnic albanians have died in clashes with 
serbdominated security forces in the past 18 months as the 
albanian majority there struggles to regain autonomy 
serbias tactics in kosovo have drawn increasing criticism from 
visiting western delegations 
last week 21 police and dozens of demonstrators were injured in 
clashes between security forces and thousands of albanians waiting 
to greet a us congressional delegation investigating alleged 
human rights abuses 
the delegation led by republican sen robert dole of kansas 
said later it was deeply disturbed by fresh evidence that 
serbian authorities are engaged in a systematic pattern of 
violating the rights of albanians 
the delegation was led by christine von kohl a danishborn 
correspondent who now lives in austria but previously spent several 
years working in belgrade cohen and an austrian were the other two 
detained 
vera caric head of the press department of the yugoslav federal 
government said that neither her office nor the foreign ministry 
had official word of the delegations visit 
serbian authorities were not immediately available for comment 
kosovo is the heartland of serbias ancient medieval kingdom and 
the issue of its autonomy is a highly emotional one in the state 
yugoslavias largest serbs maintain that if given selfgovernment 
ethnic albanians would secede and merge with neighboring albania

children have been able to leave

ailing men left aboard two iraqi airways flights on saturday in 
the first major airlift since saddam announced they could go some

nasa headed with confidence today 
into the final hours of columbias countdown which was halted once 
before by fuel leaks and then by problems with one of four 
telescopes aboard 
columbia is scheduled to blast off with seven astronauts and the 
astro observatory at 120 am edt thursday 
it will be nasas first shuttle launch in more than four months 
the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following 
the 1986 challenger disaster 
were not tracking any problems at the current time 
everyones upbeat ready to go test director mike leinbach said 
today 
air force meteorologists today were predicting an 80 percent 
chance of good weather at launch time and expected the outlook to 
improve as the day wore on 
an important test was to come this afternoon when nasa was to 
begin fueling the shuttle with a halfmillion gallons of liquid 
oxygen and liquid hydrogen a hydrogen leak forced nasa to scrub 
columbias first countdown on may 30 the leaky hydrogen lines were 
later replaced 
there will be a little apprehension of course on all of our 
parts program manager bill huddleston said tuesday but we 
have all the confidence in the world that weve got this problem 
resolved 
a launch attempt set for the weekend was scrubbed after nasa 
lost contact with astros xray telescope secured alongside three 
ultraviolet telescopes in columbias cargo bay the problem was 
corrected allowing another countdown 
the latest delay required a juggling of astros observing 
schedule said arthur davidsen principal investigator of johns 
hopkins universitys ultraviolet telescope about 150 highenergy 
objects will be observed during the nine to 10day flight some of 
them millions of degrees hot 
astronomers now will be able to observe jupiter which was too 
close to the sun last week davidsen said but an important quasar 
the brightest one has moved too close to the sun and will not 
be visible to astro 
the 150 million observatory had been scheduled for a ride on 
columbia in 1986 but the challenger disaster two months earlier 
put all missions on hold 
it will be the first scientific mission in five years dedicated 
entirely to scientific research astro will remain on board and 
return to earth for possible reuse 
the mission will be the first shuttle flight since april when 
discovery put the hubble space telescope in orbit the telescope 
was later found to have a flawed mirror that produces blurry images 
that news quickly was followed by the discovery that atlantis 
had hydrogen leaks similar to columbias nasa briefly grounded the 
threeshuttle fleet and atlantis secret military flight was 
delayed from july to november 
nasa has wasted no time getting its shuttle program back on 
track while repairing columbia and atlantis the space agency has 
been preparing discovery for an october flight with the ulysses 
satellite discovery was moved out to the other shuttle launch pad 
tuesday night 
ulysses is being sent on a fiveyear journey to explore the 
suns poles nasa has from oct 5 to oct 23 to launch discovery 
because of earths alignment with the sun and jupiter otherwise 
the mission must wait 13 months

cambodian government officials and 
rebel leaders were in jakarta today for possible meetings on a 
unsupported peace plan the talks scheduled to begin thursday 
may bring together representatives of premier hun sens 
vietnambacked government and leaders of a threemember guerrilla 
coalition 
but plans for the meetings seemed threatened tuesday after 
disputes over who would represent the various groups 
coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk said earlier this week 
he would be represented by his son prince norodom ranariddh hun 
sen said he would send a subordinate because sihanouk would not be 
in jakarta then the khmer rouge said it would boycott the talks 
because hun sen had withdrawn 
son sann leader of the third element in the coalition said he 
was prepared to hold talks on cambodia despite the absence of hun 
sen 
i hope hun sen will be coming soon if they are serious 
they will come said khmer rouge leader khieu samphan said after 
arriving in jakarta 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas arranged for no more than 
three days of informal talks on a peace plan adopted aug 28 by the 
five permanent members of the un security council 
the plan approved by the united states the soviet union 
china britain and france calls for a truce and un supervision 
before elections it also proposes a supreme national council of 
representatives from the four cambodian factions 
khieu samphan said he hoped his arrival would encourage hun sen 
to make an appearance 
all three guerrilla factions welcomed the un plan phnom penh 
however expressed support for a major un role but said it 
should retain power in the interim period 
the peace plan originally proposed by australia appears to 
offer the best hope to end the decadesold conflict 
millions have been killed in cambodia since 1970 when a coup 
ended three decades of rule by sihanouk the khmer rouge won a 
civil war in 1975 and ruled the nation for three years its blamed 
for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in efforts to 
create a new agrarian society 
the sovietbacked vietnamese invaded in december 1978 guerrilla 
combat and near famine in 1979 drove hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians to un refugee camps in thailand 
the hun sen government comprises largely khmer rouge defectors 
sihanouk said from beijing that he was not coming to jakarta 
because hun sen should negotiate with son sann who is premier of 
the resistance coalition 
sihanouk also said he doesnt want bilateral talks with hun sen 
because a solution must be worked out among all four cambodian 
factions 
the khmer rouge receives weapons and supplies from china moscow 
backs the phnom penh government and the united states supports the 
noncommunist factions under sihanouk and son sann

patrols of jewish sites after a vandal scrawled hate graffiti on a 
monument at umschlagplatz where jews were put aboard trains to the 
treblinka death camp in world war ii

was discovered early monday at the monument which was dedicated in 
april 1988 on the 45th anniversary of the warsaw jewish ghetto 
uprising 
authorities were alerted by residents but the graffiti was not 
removed until tuesday due to bureaucratic shuffling the newspaper 
gazeta wyborcza reported 
this deserves contempt this hurts wounds and casts a shadow 
on the great majority of poles who consider such an act as 
sordid said government minister aleksander hall 
hall representing prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis cabinet 
laid flowers at the monument tuesday to honor the jewish victims 
not only the church but the whole nation condemns and

britain today pledged to contribute to a 
usorganized fund to share costs of the persian gulf operation 
against iraq and treasury secretary nicholas brady called the 
european portion of his fundraising tour a success 
a spokeswoman for prime minister margaret thatcher said mrs 
thatcher promised a contribution but offered no specific amounts 
and brady told reporters after his 45minute meeting at 10 downing 
street that he was pleased by the response 
we didnt talk specific amounts but she was tremendously 
supportive and indicated that the plan we had outlined to her was 
one with which she agreed brady said 
brady left immediately for seoul where he was to hold talks 
with south korean president roh taewoo on friday before heading to 
tokyo the last stop on his fournation journey to meet with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
at a news conference brady rejected suggestions that european 
and asian leaders might resent being leaned on by the united states 
to put up more money for the persian gulf campaign 
quite the contrary mrs thatcher thought it was exactly the 
right thing to do brady said 
earlier brady had said he believed increased assistance would 
be forthcoming once the allies review the details of the american 
proposal more closely 
but he said his fourday fundraising marathon may not bear 
fruit until the allies have a chance to study the us proposals 
and their own economic assessment of the situation in more detail 
brady met with french government officials on tuesday 
the administration is seeking more than 25 billion in economic 
assistance to defray the military and economic costs of the 
campaign to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
french foreign minister roland dumas said following his 
discussions with brady late tuesday in paris that the two had 
enjoyed a very constructive conversation and we will look at 
these problems in the near future 
us officials said the french had told brady that the question 
of increased european economic assistance would be taken up at a 
meeting of officials of the 12nation european community on friday 
for his part brady gave what amounted to a pep talk to the 
allies contending that they were close to putting into place the 
final pieces of a threepart strategy to resolve the mideast crisis 
he said that strategy focused on the trade embargo approved by 
the united nations the military buildup led by the united states 
and economic assistance to provide staying power for the first 
two efforts 
there is diplomatic support there is military support and now 
we have the job of providing economic support brady said 
bradys globegirdling jaunt was one of two administration 
efforts to round up economic support secretary of state james a 
baker iii was scheduled to leave washington tonight on a similar 
mission to oilrich countries of the middle east with later stops 
planned in west germany and italy 
the administration has a lot riding on its fund drive it fears 
that without a substantial flow of economic assistance third world 
nations especially hurt by the loss of trade with iraq will begin 
violating the embargo 
officials speaking to reporters aboard bradys plane said a 
critical need at present was to get commitments for 10 billion or 
more to provide assistance to turkey jordan and egypt the three 
countries suffering the most economically from the persian gulf 
crisis 
in addition the brady mission was discussing allied support to 
help defray the cost of the huge us military buildup 
japan and west germany two economic superpowers who depend on 
mideast oil are being looked to along with saudi arabia and the 
exiled government of kuwait to help provide perhaps 11 billion a 
month or more to cover such us costs as transportation and 
housing for military forces 
the administration also was discussing raising funds to help the 
emerging democracies of eastern europe and other countries such as 
brazil and the philippines cope with higher oil prices

construction of polands only nuclear 
power plant project has been halted under a new policy stressing 
coal and other natural energy sources the official news agency 
reported today 
work on the four 440magawatt reactors began in 1983 and the 
first reactor was scheduled to start producing electricity as early 
as next year 
but concerns about rising costs and environmental dangers have 
plagued the plant at zarnowiec on the baltic coast northwest of 
gdansk demonstrations against the project intensified following 
the 1986 nuclear accident at chernobyl in the soviet ukraine 
prime minster tadeusz mazowieckis cabinet voted to stop work on 
the plant and devise a plan to sell off components 
the costs of the completion of the investment would probably 
exceed construction costs of a conventional plant of equal 
performance the council of ministers said following its decision 
tuesday the pap news agency reported 
work was stopped last year on polands only other nuclear 
project located in klempicz about 150 miles west of warsaw that 
plant was to have four 1000megawatt reactors also of soviet 
design 
under the new energy policy development of nuclear power is not 
envisioned until at least the year 2000 and then only in a 
limited scope according to pap 
the plan worked out by the solidarityled government urged 
continued reliance on coal but supported a shift to more efficient 
energy sources such as natural gas crude oil and water power

a federal bankruptcy judge has thrown into 
jeopardy the 52 million deal by a san diego evangelist to purchase 
the assets of the ptl ministry once headed by jim bakker 
this deal is in big big trouble said dennis shedd the 
courtappointed trustee overseeing the sale of the defunct 
religious empire near fort mill 10 miles south of charlotte nc 
i dont think people are aware of how serious this is but 
they should be shedd said after a bankruptcy court ruling 
tuesday 
judge thurmond bishop ruled against the preferential right that 
evangelist morris cerullo claimed to negotiate an extension of 
ptls contract for satellite time from home box office 
hbo officials said they can strike a better deal for their 
satellite time from someone else 
without the network cerullos plan could crumble 
were going to have to regroup and decide whether to appeal or 
whatever we have to do shedd said 
if cerullo decides ptl isnt worth buying without the satellite 
time and backs out of the deal he stands to lose a 7 million 
nonrefundable deposit for the network and an additional 1 million 
deposit for the remaining assets of ptls bankrupt christian 
retreat and theme park 
the issue tuesday involved a contract bakker signed with hbo in 
1985 to sublease satellite time that allowed ptl to beam its gospel 
to cable tv systems serving millions of people 
bakkers inspirational satellite network and broadcast 
facilities reached about 800 cable systems and 7 million cable 
households in the united states at its peak 
the contract calling for monthly payments of 242000 expires 
in february 
cerullo wanted hbo to approve the transfer of ownership for the 
few remaining months he also wanted to negotiate an extension of 
the contract so he could continue to use hbos leased satellite 
capacity 
chicago lawyer james cherney represented hbo in court tuesday 
and argued that cerullo does not have the right under his agreement 
to purchase ptl to negotiate with them concerning an extension of 
bakkers original contract 
bishop ruled in favor of hbo 
if the judges ruling is not appealed and stands hbo could sign 
a contract with anyone for the satellite time 
an hbo official told the herald of rock hill on tuesday it is 
unlikely they would sign an agreement with cerullo 
we got a much better offer from turner broadcasting system 
and wed feel a lot better with him on board than cerullo he 
said 
tim treadwell attorney for cerullo refused to comment after 
the judges decision 
earlier this summer cerullo received court permission to buy 
ptls remaining assets including the 2200acre heritage usa the 
property closed since hurricane hugo struck in september 1989 
includes two 500room luxury hotels a theme park five 
restaurants a shopping mall a water park conference center 
housing projects and more than 1500 acres of undeveloped land 
cerullo announced in august he planned a 15 million facelift 
for the retreat before reopening it in mid1991 
ptl has been in bankruptcy since june 1987 when bakker resigned 
amid a sexandmoney scandal he is now serving a 45yearold 
federal prison sentence for conspiracy and defrauding his followers 
of millions of dollars

researchers are intrigued by a report 
linking a virus to chronic fatigue syndrome but say more study is 
needed before the cause of the mysterious debilitating illness is 
known 
a study released tuesday said evidence of a type of virus known 
as a retrovirus was found in the blood of 23 of 30 victims of the 
syndrome many of their healthy relatives also showed evidence of 
the virus suggesting it is contagious the researchers said 
its very interesting and it definitely needs to be followed 
up said ann schluederberg chief of the virology branch of the 
national institutes of health she said a more direct 
causeandeffect must be established 
there are things about it that make it not at all implausible 
just more has to be done she said 
the findings mean hope for treatment for those who suffer from 
the syndrome and vindication for those who were told the symptoms 
were all in their heads 
its very encouraging very important said marya grambs 
director of the chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome 
foundation in san francisco 
this is first time anything has been published but the 
information and suspicion has been very clear for a while she 
said 
the foundation one of four national groups dedicated to the 
illness estimates 3 to 10 million americans are afflicted 
the disease starts with flulike symptoms and can develop into 
overwhelming fatigue and depression other symptoms include muscle 
and joint pain headaches fever sore throat memory lapses and 
depression 
because the symptoms mimic those of many other diseases it is 
often misdiagnosed she said 
its so critical that this disease is recognized by the 
government and medical community so it can be aggressively 
researched so people who have it can be validated and not told 
theyre crazy she said 
because it was widely reported among welleducated women in 
their 30s and 40s the syndrome was dubbed yuppie flu 
the new findings were presented tuesday at a neuropathology 
conference in kyoto japan by elaine defreitas of the wistar 
institute in philadelphia dr paul cheney of charlotte nc and 
dr david bell of lyndonville ny 
if it turns out to be the agent causing this then we learn 
something about treatment and something about prevention said 
walter j gunn principal cfs investigator for the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta it has the potential to be a very 
important study 
but the research must be replicated several times before it is 
accepted by the scientific and medical community gunn said 
this is an extremely tricky area he said it would not be 
hard to make a mistake 
defreitas herself told the charlotte observer i dont think 
any of us understands what this thing is or how its transmitted 
or what the role of this agent is in this disease certainly the 
studies have to be replicated 
using a new laboratory technique defreitas found that nine of 
11 adults and 14 of 19 children had blood cells containing a viral 
sequence similar to the human tcell lymphotropic retrovirus 
specifically htlvii 
the htlv family of retroviruses is linked with leukemia chronic 
diseases of the central nervous system and aids 
defreitas also checked 10 healthy adults and 10 healthy babies 
as controls and none showed the presence of such viruspositive 
blood cells 
the researchers checked outwardly healthy relatives and close 
friends of the cfs patients they found that 43 percent of those 
exposed to the sick adults tested positively and 29 percent of 
those exposed to the sick children tested positively 
retroviruses are not supposed to be casually transmitted among 
humans cheney told the observer maybe we found the one that 
is 
the cdc is conducting a study to estimate how many people have 
the disease gunn said the center gets 1000 to 2000 phone calls 
a month from people who suspect they have cfs he said

the united states and its allies must plan a 
new regional security structure for the middle east that would 
not only stop iraqi aggression but deal with future crises in the 
region secretary of state james a baker iii said today 
this is not the last crisis of this nature we are likely to 
face in this region baker said of iraqs invasion last month of 
kuwait 
it is worthwhile to begin considering regional security 
structures that would guarantee an equilibrium in this region 
that will produce peace and create a more durable order 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee 
baker cautioned that planning for such a structure has barely 
begun and he said it would not necessarily have to be modeled on 
the western nato alliance or involve a leading role for the united 
states 
but on tuesday at a similar hearing before the house foreign 
affairs committee baker compared the function of such a regional 
alliance to natos role in containing the soviet union following 
world war ii 
after tuesdays session baker told a reporter that the 
structure could be military in nature or diplomatic and political 
he told the house panel it should include major arab 
participation

a federal prosecutor warned jurors today they 
would enter a strange world during the trial of an excia agent 
accused of not paying taxes on his share of irancontra arms 
profits and hiding some of it in switzerland 
the evidence will take you into a world you are unfamiliar 
with stuart e abrams told jurors in opening arguments its a 
world of international arms deals secret financial accounts and a 
world in which financial transactions are made in large sums of 
money 
thomas g clines 62 of middleburg va is on trial for 
allegedly underreporting arms sale earnings on his 1985 and 1986 
tax returns he also is charged with failing to tell the internal 
revenue service about overseas bank accounts 
clines and others allegedly sold arms to iran then used some of 
the profits to supply weapons to the contra rebels in nicaragua at 
a time when such aid was banned by congress some of the money was 
kept in a foreign account codenamed ctea according to the 
congressional irancontra report issued in november 1987 
the government contends clines reaped about 882000 in 
commissions 
clines pleaded innocent march 9 to all four counts of an 
indictment returned feb 22 if convicted of all crimes he could 
be fined up to 1 million and sentenced to 16 years in prison 
clines reported gross receipts of 265000 for the tax year 1985 
and 402513 for 1986 prosecutors said 
abrams told jurors that clines received 20 percent of arms sales 
profits in 1985 and 30 percent in 1986 
some of the money he sent back to banks in the united states 
but not all of it abrams said hundreds of thousands of dollars 
were transferred into the swiss account he said 
defense attorney paula m junghans told the jurors in her 
opening statements that clines is looking forward to the 
opportunity to explain his side 
dont assume because the government has amassed all this 
paperwork that something must be wrong she told the jurors 
there is no charge in this case that says it is a crime to buy 
and sell arms 
retired air force maj gen richard v secord is expected to be 
the first government witness 
secord enlisted clines a 29year cia agentturnedinvestor and 
consultant as the primary broker for the arms deals in 1985 and 
1986 according to the congressional report 
secord and iranianborn businessman albert hakim operated the 
enterprise a maze of companies set up to carry out the arms 
sales to iran and the military supply shipments to the contras 
prosecutors said the enterprise was formed at the request of 
former national security adviser john poindexter and oliver north 
a retired marine lieutenant colonel who was a national security 
council staff member 
the enterprise took in nearly 48 million 122 million more 
than its expenditures during its first two years of operation 
the congressional report said secord hakim and clines took 
commissions from the 122 million surplus to reward themselves 
for their work on arms deliveries the report said the 
commissions totaled approximately 44 million 
prosecutors have alleged that secord made more than 1 million 
from his role while secord has maintained that he made no more 
than 250000 
secord pleaded guilty nov 8 1989 to one felony count of 
making false statements to the irancontra congressional 
committees he was sentenced in january to two years of probation

the albuquerque nm tribune on the savings and loan industry 
it seems that each day brings more bad news about the savings 
and loan mess the latest quarterly review of the industry by the 
office of thrift supervision documents a dramatic decline 
even the healthiest thrifts are showing an increase in losses 
and defaulted loans and the number of those healthy thrifts is 
dwindling in the recent survey the ots dropped 106 savings and 
loans from its list of wellcapitalized and profitable 
institutions fewer than half the thrifts in the country 
excluding those taken over by the government can now be 
considered in robust financial health 
an even darker portent the rot is spreading from texas and the 
southwest into the northeast and midatlantic states california 
long considered the safest territory for the industry is also 
feeling the pinch 
washington has yet to get serious about the savings and loan 
scandal posturing and fingerpointing are the order of the day 
our national leaders may choose to whistle past the graveyard 
but the data dont lie the savings and loan industry is dying a 
slow and agonizing death and the taxpayer must pay for its 
expensive funeral

the providence ri journalbulletin on housing problems 
once again congress has left to the last minute its annual 
renewal of two tax breaks that are needed to alleviate pressing 
housing problems 
a mortgage revenue bond program essential to firsttime 
homebuyers of moderate means as well as tax credits needed to keep 
rental units affordable to the poor will expire later this year 
unless they are extended we believe neither program should be 
allowed to lapse because of the unresolved federal budget dispute 
ironically both enjoy wide support in congress some 300 
lawmakers have endorsed them however there is always the 
danger they could fall between the boards as bigger fiscal issues 
monopolize attention to avoid that congress should promptly pass 
bills to renew these programs when legislators reconvene this month

the florence sc morning news on scientific discoveries 
although the headlines and news shows are often dominated by the 
big events such as blockades troop movements and the stock 
markets very often major improvements in society are done in small 
ways microscopic ways to be exact 
scientists at the johns hopkins oncology center in baltimore 
have isolated a gene that prevents colonies of cancer tumors from 
growing the gene called p53 could lead to finding natural 
proteins to switch off cancer p53 is one of a group of what is 
known as suppressor genes because they appear to act as a brake on 
cancer formation suppressor genes have been found to be either 
missing or mutated in the cells of several types of solid cancer 
tumors researchers have noted 
there is still a long way to go and many things to study 
before the experiments become a treatment for cancer patients but 
it is an example of genetic research and the enormous benefits it 
has for mankind 
last month the genetic revolution progressed when a federal 
panel for the first time approved two gene therapies for tests on 
humans within a year scientists should know whether the tests are 
effective against a lethal skin cancer and a rare deficiency of the 
immune system 
it is true that genetic experimentation is fraught with dangers 
but so is every human endeavor our ancestors probably thought fire 
was a great advance until they realized that they too could burn 
nevertheless they kept setting fires 
no doubt there will be abuses in the research not once in all 
of history has there not been abuses in research but there have 
also been tremendous advances in the 21st century and perhaps 
before the genetic revolution may well remake society even more 
than the computer revolution has changed work and leisure in the 
latter part of the 20th century 
obviously careful study and planning are needed we do not know 
the pitfalls that await in genetic research but to stop would be 
akin to our ancestors putting out fire because someone slipped and 
fell in the flames

files 
raoul wallenberg a swedish diplomat saved the lives of as many 
as 100000 jews in hungary during the closing months of world war 
ii then wallenberg vanished an apparent victim of bloodthirsty 
soviet secret police who suspected he was a spy 
but reports that wallenberg may have survived into the 1980s 
and still may even be alive have intrigued investigators of the 
stature of the late andrei sakharov now the soviet union in one 
of the most dramatic acts of glasnost has agreed to open its files 
on wallenberg 
soviet officials now say that they will open the archives of the 
kgb and other agencies to an international commission investigating 
the fate of wallenberg it is almost certainly too late to save 
wallenberg as he saved so many others but at least the world can 
learn the truth about his fate by refusing to give up their quest 
for the truth investigators have honored one of the centurys

with each passing month it becomes increasingly clear that the 
soviet union is no longer americas chief adversary in the world 
indeed it is coming to look more and more like an ally the sept 
9 ussoviet summits main purpose is to intensify international 
pressure on iraqs saddam hussein a venture in which the united 
states and soviet union are on the same side 
the united states and the soviet union still have thousands of 
nuclear warheads trained on each others territory and 
negotiations aimed at reducing those weapons have stalled but 
weve reached a stage where the specter of deadlocked arms talks no 
longer arouses a sense of foreboding 
that could change of course in the unlikely event that soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev is ousted in favor of someone more 
menacing but for now a bushgorbachev meeting reminds one less 
of the superpower summits of old than of those routine 
gettogethers a us president has from time to time with the west 
german chancellor or the british prime minister

los angeles daily news on sex discrimination in the saudi desert 
while doing their duty us servicewomen have been forced to 
make some absurd concessions that male soldiers havent been asked 
to make such as wearing excessive clothing in the blistering heat 
its apparently been the militarys way of making sure that 
american forces dont offend their saudi hosts whose islamic 
customs are exceedingly repressive toward women 
fortunately there are signs that relief from the heat and some 
forms of discrimination are on the way restrictive dress rules for 
military women have been relaxed on at least one us military 
compound in saudi arabia according to the husband of an air force 
sergeant sent to the region 
female soldiers are now being permitted to wear shorts in their 
offduty hours within their living area they also may wear bathing 
suits when swimming in a portable pool at the compound 
servicewomen whould be given that much leeway at every military 
installation in saudi arabia 
theres a chance that any change in the rules would not sit well 
with the saudis this is a country after all where women must use 
separate beaches cover most of their faces in public and are not

sunday mail harare zimbabwe on the persian gulf 
once western economies wobble the ripple effects reach 
developing countries sooner rather than later and the effect 
of the crisis in the persian gulf will be felt when many 
developing countries are perhaps most vulnerable 
many have adopted exportled structural adjustment programs and 
if a recession however mild is added to the growing trend in 
trade protectionism in the west those programs could stumble and 
fall 
this once again highlights the importance of developing 
countries to lessen their present almost total reliance on western 
markets for both exports and imports 
aug 30 
the statesman calcutta india on the persian gulf 
for all the aggressive bluster and massing of troops and 
warships in the area a political solution to the crisis in the 
persian gulf cannot be ruled out 
while prone to miscalculating the consequences of his 
aggression iraqi president saddam hussein has a sensible 
appreciation for the mailed fist for he wields one himself after 
all 
militarily he cannot hope to match the west he must 
therefore consider withdrawal from kuwait

the guardian london on the persian gulf 
because america is the greatest democracy it cannot adequately 
play the part of freedoms flying squad 
the bitter ghosts of the vietnam venture are not exorcized they 
are one of the dominant themes of hollywood at the start of the 
90s the controlled experiments of grenada and panama sanitized 
war with no bodies in the bag for the cameras have not 
reconciled the american voter the human being with human rights 
to a world where thousands upon thousands of lives may be put in 
jeopardy in foreign fields 
the myth of a hightech war fought by fighting machines at long 
range is just that a myth the mirror image of a television world 
which showed the citizens of the soviet union what economic misery 
they were enduring is that those same screens will show dead 
americans and dead civilians caught up in a melee of bloodshed 
there is no longterm reality to this role it is not what 
democracies are about it is an attempt by old minds left bereft 
by the crumbling of the cold war to construct a new order which 
merely echoes the simplicities of the past 
in fact there is only one global policeman that for its 
frailties is the united nations because it represents the 
collective wisdom of a world of many nations and infinite systems 
of government it is not the excuse for action in the gulf it is 
for good or ill the pivot of it

straits times singapore on the soviet union 
it is getting increasingly difficult these days to fault soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev for radicalism the man who began his 
career at the kremlin as an undoubted revolutionary though of the 
peaceful variety shows signs five years later of transformation 
into an establishment figure who lives an uneasy life between the 
nostalgia of revolution and the realities of power 
he acknowledged last week that there was public scepticism over 
the reform program an economic collapse of the country could not 
be ruled out as could not serious tears in its political fabric 
 
if his reforms are to mean anything they must not only move 
forward but gather momentum an honest and speedy transition to a 
market economy is a necessity not a luxury 
gorbachev can take heart that there is someone who understands 
just how critical matters are russian federation president boris 
yeltsin whose radical posture calls for privatization the closing 
of inefficient industries and an end to heavy subsidies has often 
differed with gorbachev 
it was reported however that the two had agreed last week on 
the need for urgent and drastic action that cooperation will 
hopefully come about and continue the kremlin leader needs all the 
radicals he can get to put the spirit back into the gorbachev 
revolution in present soviet circumstances nothing less than a 
revolution is needed to keep reform alive

national concord lagos nigeria on the proposal that african 
nation should establish a continental defense force 
it appears that an african high command has become irrelevant to 
the realities of african politics today 
for one thing the fact has been firmly established that african 
nations do not share a common ideological perspective and the 
operations of the proposed defense force would only subject the 
organization of african unity to intense controversy and 
unnecessary acrimony 
furthermore most of the problems plaguing various countries are 
so local in nature that they do not warrant the intervention of a 
continental force 
in these circumstances the oau should perhaps think of a 
contingency arrangement whereby a peacekeeping force could be put 
together when the need arises

president bush said today that even though the 
government is occupied with the persian gulf crisis progress is 
being made in the fight against illegal drugs which remains a top 
priority 
i know that other subjects preoccupy all of us these days but 
this one remains number one will continue to remain number one 
when the international situation has calmed down the president 
said 
in remarks to a group of staff and reporters a year after he 
laid out his drug war strategy bush declared 
i think america is making progress against drugs and will 
continue to do so 
he cited a decrease in casual drug use and decreased 
availability of cocaine 
bushs chief lieutenant in the fight against drugs provided a 
more detailed assessment of the administrations contention that 
the war is being won 
last years hopeless cause is this years revived opportunity 
for victory national drug policy director william j bennett 
said in remarks to the gathering marking the anniversary of bushs 
drug speech 
i think a prudent and cautious judgment on our present 
circumstances would be that the drug problem in general 
nationwide is no longer getting worse and in some very 
significant aspects it is now getting better not victory but 
success bennett said 
in an interview tuesday bennett contrasted the current drug 
picture with the situation when he took office 18 months ago 
at the time he recalled people said his job was undoable 
mission impossible figurehead nothing can happen 
instead bennett said the government actually can get some 
things done if it is given the right equipment the right direction 
and the command of the president and we made some progress 
however he said this is no time to let up and stop pursuing 
the drug strategy that stresses tough enforcement of drug laws when 
violated by either traffickers or users as well as increased 
spending on treatment and education 
theres plenty more to do bennett said there are some 
places that are not getting better 
the announcement of the drug strategy last sept 5 was bushs 
first primetime televised speech in it the president said he 
wanted to make our streets and neighborhoods safe he referred 
to people being mugged on the way home from work by crack gangs 
and children dodging bullets as they went to school 
in the past year thanks in large part to colombias crackdown 
on the cocaine cartels that was strongly supported by the united 
states the supply of cocaine to this country has decreased 
but instead of making the streets of america safer bennett said 
earlier this summer the cocaine shortage increased the violence 
because of greater competition among drug dealers there will be 
the same number of dogs fighting over a smaller number of bones 
he said 
asked tuesday whether the american people might be wondering 
just what the drug war is all about if battles won cause more 
violence bennett said the violence fuels the national interest 
and the interest of citizens but it isnt the only thing that 
fuels their interest 
i think the largest part of the concern that people have is 
how it will affect their children he said 
the high level of violence is not always connected to the drug 
trade he said he noted that the murder rate has declined in some 
cities detroit dallas san francisco and san diego which are 
not necessarily the same cities where were seeing the greatest 
progress in the war on drugs 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee was releasing a report today citing some 
successes of the drug war and some failures including an increased 
number of murders this year inadequate drug education and lack of 
treatment for pregnant or incarcerated addicts 
rep john conyers chairman of the house committee on government 
operations said we are losing the drug war in our inner cities 
prevention and education efforts directed at the educated 
middle class appear to be having a dramatic effect the michigan 
democrat said in a statement treatment programs have room for 
clients who can afford to pay however the chronically addicted 
cannot pay when they are poor and unemployed as is often the 
case 
conyers urged reallocation of the federal drug budget spending 
an equal amount on treatment and prevention as is spent on law 
enforcement the current split is almost 70 percent for law 
enforcement the rest for treatment and education 
the national institute on drug abuse recently reported that the 
number of cocainerelated emergency room visits continued to 
decline in the first quarter of 1990 a drop first seen in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 
the institute which gets its figures from the drug abuse 
warning network of hospital emergency rooms and coroners 
nationwide also found that the number of heroinrelated emergency 
room visits declined in early 1990 however the number of people 
who died with traces of cocaine or heroin in their systems 
increased in 1989 
as for attitudes a survey released tuesday found that an 
everincreasing segment of the american public including 
teenagers is rejecting illegal drugs seeing their use as 
dangerous and unattractive behavior 
this trend was observed in all major ethnic groups whites 
blacks and hispanics according to the survey by the gordon s 
black corp

the new england aquarium plans to send one of its 
three show dolphins to a navy program that does research on them 
and trains them for military work a move that has prompted 
protests 
federal records indicate it will be the fourth dolphin the 
aquarium has sent to the us naval ocean systems center in san 
diego in the last 10 years the boston globe said today 
the curator of marine mammals at the aquarium kathy krieger 
worked for the ocean systems center for two years 
the dolphin to be sent there is rainbow who is about 11 years 
old and is being sent because he is aggressive and incompatible 
with the other two used in shows at the aquarium she said 
we feel that is the place he will get the best care she 
said she admitted the aquarium does not know exactly what the navy 
plans to do with him 
we know he will not be treated in an inhumane manner or be in 
any danger she said the people who work with the animals in 
the navy assure us that none of the animals have been hurt 
thomas lapuzza spokesman for the navy center said rainbow will 
be used immediately for research but he could not say whether he 
ever will be used for military work 
the navys dolphin program is classified it has been criticized 
for use of animals in war and for the way dolphins are treated 
im very surprised they would plan on releasing animals to the 
navy im shocked scott van valkenburg of the boston marine 
mammal coalition told the globe 
the fact that they might be sending animals to a program where 
they might be used in military action is amazing he said the 
group said it plans a protest rally saturday 
were looking into how they are planning to transport this 
dolphin said doreene close of the coalition to end animal 
suffering and exploitation if we can find that out we will do 
everything in our power to stop it 
the navy will send the aquarium an 11yearold partially deaf 
female dolphin as a replacement for rainbow and ms krieger 
thought it would fit in better with the other two at the aquarium 
lapuzza said the navy used dolphins for military work in vietnam 
and in 1987 in the persian gulf but he would not say what they did 
a former trainer at the navy facility said dolphins were trained 
to kill with 45caliber guns attached to nose cones the globe 
said the guns would be triggered when dolphins rammed enemy 
frogmen the navy refused to comment on those allegations

some 2000 egyptian soldiers along with 
kuwaitis who fought invading iraqis a month ago are manning the 
front line below the kuwaiti border officers said wednesday 
these are among the visible arab units in the multinational 
force led by the united states to defend saudi arabia against a 
possible attack by iraq 
the total number of arab forces has not been disclosed and 
there has been confusion over the number of troops promised by 
various arab countries and the number actually sent 
saudi officers say 3000 syrians and the same number of 
moroccans are in the field but correspondents taken to the sector 
by the saudi military did not see any of them 
the reported syrian presence would mark the first time syrian 
troops have stood beside the egyptians since they fought israel in 
the 1973 yom kippur war 
arab forces form the first line of defense along the 
northeastern desert and coastal approaches to saudi arabias 
oilrich eastern province south of them are the us forces the 
desert is dotted with small encampments antiaircraft units 
platoons of tanks and armored personnel carriers 
at one of the camps maj gen turki alnufaie said he was 
waiting for units to arrive to put his total force at a division 
and a little more 
he commands saudi arabias 20th mechanized brigade and the rapid 
deployment force made up of troops from the six gulf cooperation 
council states saudi arabia kuwait the united arab emirates 
bahrain qatar and oman 
alnufaie gave no strength figures but judging by the size of 
the units described by other officers he may be talking about 
20000 troops alnufaie said that once those troops whom he did 
not identify reached the scene we await orders to deploy to 
defensive positions 
he said the syrians were deployed east of his position but were 
not under his command 
kuwaits defense minister told the associated press on tuesday 
that a 7000man force of kuwaits 16000strong army was currently 
on maneuvers and that half of them would soon join as regulars 
in northern saudi arabia 
a short distance from alnufaies command post troops 
identified as kuwaitis were dug in with armored personnel carriers 
and other vehicles 
egyptian president hosni mubarak was the first arab leader to 
offer soldiers for the saudi cause but their status has been 
marked by confusion 
a defense ministry source in cairo was quoted aug 16 as saying 
there were 3000 egyptians in saudi arabia and 2000 more were en 
route to join them 
on tuesday egypts staterun middle east news agency said an 
unspecified number of egyptian troops was en route to the united 
arab emirates 
military sources have said the total in saudi arabia is 4000 
including paratroopers commandos infantrymen and chemical warfare 
specialists

former sen lawton chiles overcame questions about 
his mental stability and swept to victory over rep bill nelson for 
floridas democratic nomination for governor gov bob martinez 
easily captured the gop nomination 
in nevada gov bob miller crushed five challengers tuesday for 
the democratic nomination for a full term in the job he assumed two 
years ago businessman jim gallaway topped seven other republicans 
for the gop nomination 
chiles wasnt the only political comeback in florida impeached 
federal judge alcee hastings won a slot in a democratic runoff for 
secretary of state 
and voters in two florida counties rejected controversial ballot 
measures in broward an ordinance that would have protected 
homosexuals against discrimination was defeated 59 percent to 41 
percent in sarasota voters decided by 73 percent to 27 percent 
not to slap a twoyear moratorium on growth 
chiles and martinez both captured 69 percent of the vote 
nelson chiles and other democratic leaders held a unity rally 
today at the state capitol 
its awfully good to be the head of a united democratic ticket 
and i think thats what we have this time a united democratic 
ticket chiles said 
martinez greeted supporters in tampa today then jetted to 
miami with stops in orlando and jacksonville also planned 
weve reached a point where reality has to take over from 
rhetoric and substances over slogans martinez said claiming he 
knows state issues and is more specific than chiles 
martinez campaign manager jm mac stipanovich said chiles 
had retreated into overinflated 60s liberal bull that has no 
place in society 
chiles a 60yearold moderate retired two years ago saying he 
was burned out from three terms in the senate at the time he was 
chairman of the budget committee he was diagnosed as depressed and 
began using the drug prozac 
during the campaign he was dogged by questions about his age 
and mental stability and was pressured into releasing his medical 
records 
nelsons running mate state house speaker tom gustafson was 
widely criticized and finally apologized for suggesting chiles 
could be suicidal such attacks were thought to have produced a 
voter backlash in chiles favor 
chiles received 739916 votes to 325448 votes or 31 percent 
for nelson a sixterm congressman 
chiles told supporters his victory represented a mandate for his 
campaigns theme an attack on bigmoney politics he had limited 
contributions to 100 and raised 2 million nelson raised 6 
million and spent 1 million of his own 
we thought people should count more than money chiles said 
and we felt like that people could join with us if we did limit 
our contributions and if we trusted them they would respond 
nelson a 47yearold who went on a space shuttle mission as a 
member of congress in 1986 had claimed to have more energy and 
vision to lead the state 
martinez who is considered vulnerable because of his 
antiabortion stance and his support three years ago of a services 
tax that later was repealed had 457952 votes to state sen 
marlene woodson howards 131782 votes or 20 percent three other 
contenders divided the remainder 
martinez said he would focus his campaign on his 
administrations achievements in the environment crime education 
reform and drugs 
in nevada miller had moved up to governor automatically from 
lieutenant governor in 1988 after gov dick bryan was elected to 
the us senate 
nearly complete returns showed miller with 66998 votes or 81 
percent none of the above which appears on all nevada 
ballots as a means of voter protest received 6754 votes or 8 
percent a longshot hopeful who changed his name to rhinestone 
cowboy ran third with 2308 votes or 3 percent 
in the gop race gallaway had 35628 votes or 50 percent 
none of the above drew 15637 votes or 22 percent and builder 
charlie brown had 14966 votes or 21 percent 
gallaway a relative newcomer to the state said miller had 
shown a total lack of leadership as governor but a poll last 
month of the likely matchup in november indicated miller would 
trounce gallaway 60 percent to 27 percent 
hastings who as floridas first black federal judge was removed 
by the us senate after a jury acquitted him of bribery will face 
former newspaperman jim minter in an oct 2 runoff for the 
democratic nomination for secretary of state the winner will meet 
incumbent jim smith a republican 
with 99 percent of precincts reporting minter had 355139 
votes or 38 percent to 312224 votes or 33 percent for 
hastings former ku klux klansman john paul rogers got 273454 
votes or 29 percent 
former gov claude kirk 64 also moved toward a political 
comeback winning a threeway race for the gop nomination for 
education commissioner kirk governor from 196771 avoided a 
runoff with 54 percent of the vote 
kirk and martinez are the only republican governors in florida 
since reconstruction 
the broward referendum was opposed by the roman catholic 
archdiocese of miami and by critics who warned its passage would 
bring more homosexuals and aids to the county 
in sarasota supporters of a twoyear moratorium on new 
structures said it would give time to improve services and address 
other problems of growth opponents said a halt would put thousands 
out of work and damage the economy

pressure to save fuel could increase highway 
deaths an auto safety group said wednesday in reporting new 
evidence that small cars are less safe than bigger models 
the study by the insurance institute for highway safety 
concludes that on average small cars are deadlier than less 
fuelefficient autos that japanese cars are becoming longer and 
safer while american cars are becoming shorter and more dangerous 
and that when a manufacturer reduces the size of a given model the 
model becomes more dangerous 
in a broad study begun well before the mideast crisis brought 
new attention to ways of decreasing us dependence on foreign oil 
the institute said safety too often is ignored in the debate over 
auto mileage standards 
carmakers already are required to produce cars with an average 
of 275 miles per gallon for 1990 models one legislative proposal 
would increase fuel economy 20 percent in passenger cars by 1995 
and 40 percent by 2001 
fueleconomy standards create safety problems if they force 
automakers to make cars smaller in order to increase the average 
miles per gallon of their fleets the institute said 
the organization which is financed by auto insurance companies 
researches a wide range of highway safety issues 
institute president brian oneill said there are ways to save 
more fuel without making cars smaller including engine changes 
that put less importance on power and speed and measures that 
relieve urban congestion 
but carmakers say they eventually have to make cars smaller to 
meet the stringent mileage standards 
im as good an environmentalist as the next guy but i believe 
we have to look at the complete picture oneill said 
smaller cars are more prone to rollovers and damage that can 
injure occupants the institute said offering the following 
evidence 
based on an analysis of death rates and fuel ratings for 47 
fourdoor cars on average for every one milepergallon 
improvement in fuel economy there is a 39 percent increase in the 
death rate 
overall the death rate in the smallest cars on the road is 
more than double the rate in the largest cars 3 deaths per 10000 
registered cars for the smallest cars and 13 for the largest in 
1989 
the frequency of damage claims for small twodoor cars is 35 
percent higher than for large twodoor cars 
among the 29 two and fourdoor cars with the highest frequency 
of injury claims 27 are small and two are midsized 
the institute said that in the 1979 model year the average 
wheelbase of toyotas and nissans was 15 inches shorter than the 
wheelbases of domestic ford and general motors cars and the death

the eightyear battle over the salt 
caves hydroelectric project is a western showdown reminiscent of 
those between freerange cattlemen and fencebuilding homesteaders 
but this fight is between a coalition of a city developers a 
local congressman and a federal agency facing an alliance of state 
agencies voters outoftown congressmen fishermen and 
environmentalists 
at issue is an 11mile stretch of the klamath river 27 miles 
southwest of klamath falls in southcentral oregon 
initial proposals by the city of klamath falls would have 
drowned the river behind a dam but the proposal now is for no dam 
at all just a series of canals and conduits bringing water from 
an existing dam upstream that hasnt lessened opposition 
the proposal now rests in two sets of hands 
the federal energy regulatory commission could sweep aside 
most of the objections raised by state agencies simply by granting 
a license 
congress is considering a bill that would block the commission 
by including the upper klamath river in the federal wild and scenic 
river system 
if the agency is going to crush state and regional decisions 
we think that is another reason wild and scenic legislation should 
be passed to protect this river and protect the broad range of 
people opposed to this project said chris orsinger spokesman 
for the oregon rivers council an environmental group 
opponents say the project would destroy the last freeflowing 
troutfilled stretch of a waterway already shackled by four dams 
supporters say the project can generate millions of dollars to 
help klamath falls get back on its feet after a decade of decline 
no customers have yet agreed to buy the dams electricity and 
opponents say the project cant make a profit 
the federal energy commission says there is a need for the 
electricity and the project can make a profit estimated by the 
city at 3 million a year 
in 1985 klamath falls applied to the commission for a permit to 
build a 117 million 130foottall dam at salt cave a spot named 
for holes in a cliff that would generate 140 megawatts of 
electricity 
the city even swung a deal that so far has financed planning and 
design without costing taxpayers a dime it sold 250 million worth 
of bonds then reinvested the money at a higher interest rate than 
it had to pay on the bonds 
the oregon department of fish and wildlife protested that the 
original proposal would flood one of the states premier trout 
streams and rafters said it would dry up a top summer whitewater 
run 
the city scaled down the dam in 1986 and tacked on a ski area 
to mitigate for the loss of fishing and rafting 
in 1987 thengov neil goldschmidt said oregons environment 
should be enjoyed by all not sacrificed to economic development 
for one city 
the state department of environmental quality denied the project 
a crucial water quality permit the state department of energy 
questioned the need for the power 
and reps peter defazio ron wyden and les aucoin all 
democrats from western oregon across the cascades from klamath 
falls introduced the first bill to grant federal protection to the 
river the bill failed 
in 1988 the quasigovernmental northwest power planning council 
created by congress to plan for power needs in the northwest 
included the upper klamath river among 40000 miles of northwest 
waterways where it did not want hydroelectric development 
oregon voters approved an initiative putting the upper klamath 
on the state scenic waterways list 
last year the federal energy commission suggested doing away 
with the dam and the reservoir and klamath falls agreed 
the new design would draw water directly from the tailrace of 
the jc boyle dam carry it 10 miles downstream through canals and 
conduits built into the canyon wall to a powerhouse where it would 
spin generators and be returned to the river 
michael hartfield spokesman for the salt caves project says 
the nodam proposal would improve trout habitat by taking away the 
periodic surges of water released from the boyle dam leaving a 
constant flow 
but that would mean less water in the river say opponents who 
also object to the canals and conduits 
a us supreme court decision this year backed the citys claim 
that a federal energy commission license would override the states 
opposition 
in the meantime defazio wyden and aucoin introduced another 
bill for federal protection 
the federal agency has said it will await the bills fate in 
congress before acting 
its up to congress said orsinger

iraqi troops are 
systematically looting valuable equipment from kuwait and mining 
vital oil power and watertreatment facilities a kuwaiti 
resistance leader said wednesday 
the kuwaiti a former government official said the organized 
destruction of kuwait city indicates the iraqis expect to either 
withdraw or be driven out of the country they invaded aug 2 
equipment being taken includes computers telephones and other 
communications supplies hospital beds and sophisticated medical 
equipment and even window frames the official said he declined 
to be identified for security reasons 
like other kuwaitis including government ministers in exile 
the resistance leader said he would welcome an offensive against 
the iraqi occupation forces to drive them out of kuwait 
but other kuwaitis disagree with his assessment of iraqs 
intentions regarding how long it expects to remain in kuwait which 
has the thirdlargest oil reserves in the world 
some ministers of kuwaits governmentinexile based in taif 
saudi arabia say iraq has flooded kuwait with its citizens and may 
settle thousands of them there 
iraq annexed kuwait six days after the invasion and last week 
the former emirate was declared iraqs 19th province 
the resistance leader is an articulate englishspeaking member 
of kuwaits ruling alsabah family and an officer in kuwaits army 
he was interviewed at his headquarters not far from the kuwaiti 
border he refused to allow details of his base to be revealed 
the resistance leader said it was his impression gleaned from 
information he received from guerrillas moving secretly in and out 
of kuwait that the iraqis intend to steal what they can from 
kuwait because they know their days are numbered 
theyre destroying kuwait he said all communications 
system all telephones even traffic lights 
nothing of value is left untouched he said 
his comments could not be independently verified but some 
details conform with intelligence reports published elsewhere 
the resistance leader runs many secret crossborder operations 
smuggling ammunition supplies and communications equipment into 
kuwait for the resistance 
but despite kuwaits wellfinanced guerrilla campaign of armed 
attacks and civil disobedience the official said its obvious we 
cant wage guerrilla warfare for long the newly formed 
resistance has an estimated 10000 men compared to the estimated 
170000 troops iraq has in kuwait he said 
the kuwaitis are trying to show the world they are willing fight 
to regain their country the resistance leader said

sweaters from hong kong south korea and 
taiwan that are being sold in the united states at less than fair 
market value harm us industry and thus are subject to 
antidumping duties the government ruled wednesday 
the national knitwear amp sportswear association in new york had 
filed complaints last september against sweater manufacturers in 
the three countries the sweaters are made predominantly of acrylic 
fiber 
by a 21 vote the international trade commission determined the 
imports materially injure or threaten injury to the us 
industry the commerce department ruled earlier that the imports 
were being sold at less than fair market value 
since the commerce decisions the customs service has been 
requiring bonds equal to the amount of antidumping duties for the 
imports the bonds now will be converted and actual duties will be 
imposed on subsequent imports the duties are designed to make the 
prices of the imported sweaters comparable to those charged for 
domestic sweaters 
commerce had described the sweaters as knitted or crocheted 
outerwear garments including jackets vests cardigans and 
pullovers it said imported sweaters represent 72 percent of the 
13 billion us market and the three countries ship 55 percent of 
the imports 
it said the value of sweaters imported from hong kong in 1989 
was 2088 million south korea 4761 million and taiwan 4855 
million

the chairman of the house banking committee on 
wednesday proposed limiting the number of accounts that can be 
insured by the government and perhaps reducing maximum coverage 
below 100000 
deposit insurance is at the heart of our financial and 
economic stability said rep henry gonzalez dtexas we 
ignore its problems only with the greatest peril 
gonzalez in a speech to the house noted that in the wake of 
the failure of the fund that insured deposits in savings and loan 
institutions the bank insurance fund is facing a fifth straight 
year of multibilliondollar losses 
despite doubling bank insurance deposit premiums it will take 
as long as five years for the fund to reach a reasonably safe 
level he said 
key elements of the plan proposed by gonzalez would 
limit the number of accounts protected by federal insurance and 
consider reducing the 100000 maximum insurance 
under present law about 99 percent of all deposits are insured 
because a wealthy person can use joint and trust accounts to avoid 
the 100000 limit gonzalez said the changes also would prevent 
abuse of the insurance by pension and other investment funds 
allow regulators to raise assessments for insurance premiums as 
the need arises institutions that engage in greater risks would 
have to pay more for deposit insurance 
toughen capitalization requirements so bank owners would have 
more of their own money at risk 
limit permissible investments for insured deposits 
require a parent holding company to share responsibility for 
losses incurred by any insured affiliate 
the 1989 law bailing out depositors in failed sampls created one 
fund to insure bank deposits which already is in operation and a 
second to insure sampl deposits starting in 1992 
although the law requires the bank fund to have a reserve of at 
least 125 for each 100 of covered deposits huge losses have 
reduced the actual reserve ratio to about 60 cents per 100 
gonzalez said

overthrow leaders in countries aligned against him he singled out 
saudi arabia and egypt

departure in cooperation with concerned countries the news 
agency reported it said all border points were open for their 
departure and the iraqi airways was ready to lease its aircraft 
for flying them to any capital

are being kept behind as human shields against any us attack on 
strategic sites

doctors should encourage their patients to write 
down their wishes about whether they want lifesustaining treatment 
stopped if they become hopelessly ill according to a group medical 
ethicists 
the living wills spell out what kind of care people want if 
they become too sick to speak for themselves such directives are 
required in two states new york and missouri before food water 
and medical treatment can be withdrawn 
in june the us supreme court upheld missouris guidelines 
writing that states can require clear and convincing evidence 
of a patients wishes 
the patient in that case nancy cruzan had been in a vegetative 
state since a 1983 car accident her parents believed she would not 
want to be kept alive in such a condition and sought to have her 
tube feeding stopped however she had not made a living will and 
the court refused to allow her parents to speak for her 
a statement on the case was drawn up at the annual conference of 
bioethicists in lutsen minn in july signed by 36 ethicists and 
published in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
besides urging doctors to learn what their patients want they 
wrote that physicians should also encourage patients to discuss 
their preferences with their families and close friends and to 
prepare and sign advance directives 
even though unnecessary in most states such statements often 
help to resolve legally and ethically troubling cases they noted 
they added that the supreme court decision does not change the 
laws ethical standards and medical practices that have evolved 
since the karen ann quinlan case in 1976

president bush today told lawmakers just back 
from the persian gulf that the sanctions against iraq must succeed 
or we will review our options 
bush also placed a moraleboosting call to us ambassador 
nathaniel howell at the besieged us embassy in kuwait city where 
a skeleton staff of diplomats has stayed behind to assist americans 
trapped in iraq and kuwait 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush heard 
repeated statements of support to see this mission through from 
the more than 30 representatives and senators who attended the 
session in the state dining room 
fitzwater praised the soviet unions role in the international 
effort to isolate iraq and said the united states is now even 
more interested in helping mikhail gorbachevs faltering economy 
he quoted bush as telling the lawmakers we must keep pressure 
on iraq and convince saddam hussein that time is against him 
the president said the sanctions must succeed if not we 
will review our options said fitzwater he would not elaborate 
on todays statement by the iraqi president in baghdad that 
the children of iraq are dying because of the united nations 
embargo fitzwater said we have no evidence to that effect 
he dismissed the iraqi president remarks as another rhetorical 
diatribe intended to split arab unity and a sign of 
desperation 
for saddam hussein to claim moral rectitude is totally beyond 
belief the spokesman said 
the iraqis have cut off water and electricity to the us 
embassy as part of their drive to shut down all foreign embassies 
in the land they annexed following an aug 2 lightning invasion 
fitzwater said howell is struggling in a very difficult 
situation 
earlier sen john glenn suggested that the us troops 
stationed in the saudi arabian desert be given pay and income tax 
incentives to forestall a morale problem 
glenn who was part of a congressional delegation just back from 
th middle east said he told bush such benefits as free postage 
stamps imminent danger pay and exemption from income tax 
should be arranged for us troops on duty in saudi arabia 
i just want to forestall a morale problem among the soldiers 
who have no idea how long they will be stationed in the bleak hot 
desert where there are few comforts glenn dohio said following 
the white house meeting 
glenn also suggested the sea blockade should be extended to 
impede air cargo to iraq by imposing sanctions against countries 
where the planes originate 
sen william cohen rmaine said bush should push soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to pull remaining soviet military 
and technical advisers out of iraq he said bush should not accept 
the figleaf excuse that the advisers are there on unexpired 
contracts 
sen john kerry dmass said he urged bush to press the 
soviets for military intelligence material they could provide on 
the iraqi military capability 
the lawmakers also said they had received strong assurances from 
saudi arabias king fahd and egypts presdient hosni mubarak that 
the economic sanctions against saudi arabias saddam hussein can 
work if given enough time 
however some of the kuwaitis who fled their country when iraq 
invaded it aug 2 are more trigger happysaid house republican 
leader bob michel rill 
some other members of the congressional delegation have 
suggested us reserve combat units should be sent to saudi arabia 
to provide a critical test of the forces capabilities 
we want to see how good the combat units are rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee said 
at a news conference tuesday this is a test for the future 
rep bill dickinson of alabama the ranking republican on 
aspins panel said he regretted the pentagons decision not to 
activate national guard combat units which comprise onethird of 
the combat power of the active army divisions being sent to the 
persian gulf 
another senior member of the armed services committee rep gv 
sonny montgomery dmiss said the current situation provides 
an ideal opportunity for evaluating the reserves 
theres no shooting war lets find out if you can mobilize 
and see how many will show up said montgomery who toured 
bahrain egypt and saudi arabia in the house delegation 
the more than 9000 reservists called to active duty following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait last month have been largely confined to 
support roles backing up activeduty combat forces in the gulf 
area more than 100000 us servicemen and women are serving on 
land or sea in the region 
theres concern that were putting all this money into combat 
reserves and yet theyre not being called up said cohen 
pentagon spokesman pete williams declined to say what 
recommendations are before defense secretary dick cheney about 
increasing the reservists role he said there has been a lot of 
discussion about what might happen down the road but no decision 
has been made

most of americas largest church 
organizations cautious since the vietnam war about supporting us 
military involvement are not sure how to respond to the buildup in 
the persian gulf 
the rev tj jemison president of the national baptist 
convention usa broke with other us religious leaders during 
the churchs annual meeting this week when he criticized the 
deployment but the gathering as a whole has not yet spoken 
and in an apparent policy change today jemison told the 
convention he supports president bushs decision to send troops to 
the middle east 
as true americans we owe allegiance to the stars and stripes 
forever jemison said we are loyal and devoted citizens 
he had america the beautiful played for the convention and 
he recited the pledge of allegiance 
most religious bodies condemned the iraqi invasion of kuwait but 
are trying to figure out how to balance their opposition to saddam 
hussein with concern the us response may be motivated more by oil 
than by humanitarianism said dale bishop director of the middle 
east office of the national council of churches 
i think the caution reflects different opinions which means 
no one is feeling empowered to speak on behalf of the church on 
this issue bishop said tuesday 
the executive committee of the council the nations largest 
ecumenical body was scheduled to meet sept 12 to discuss the 
persian gulf 
the baptist convention was expected to vote thursday at its 
110th annual meeting here on a resolution attacking the troop 
deployment 
the convention is the nations thirdlargest protestant 
denomination with 78 million members and considers itself the 
largest organization of blacks in the world 
there is a moral issue jemison said its over oil were 
jeopardizing our fine young men and women over oil in the persian 
gulf 
jemison said tuesday that with pressing social needs in this 
country its really unfortunate to spend a billion dollars a 
month over oil 
other religious groups also have spoken out on the persian gulf 
crisis 
following a meeting with defense secretary dick cheney on aug 
24 11 leaders from a broad range of american jewish organizations 
issued a statement supporting president bushs policies and 
actions in addressing iraqs aggression 
robert k lifton president of the american jewish congress 
said that hussein would have entered saudi arabia unless bush acted 
and that the iraqi leader is intent on trying to hold the world 
hostage 
my view is the president did the only thing he could do at 
this time he said 
other us church leaders have been reluctant to take a stand 
i think some part of our people were so burned in the vietnam 
experience before they make a commitment to something like 
this they want to be surer than sure lifton said 
the rev paul h sherry president of the 16 millionmember 
united church of christ and the rev john o humbert president of 
the 11 millionmember christian church disciples of christ said 
in a joint letter to bush last week that restraint is essential in 
working toward a negotiated peace 
the american friends service committee an independent quaker 
organization in philadelphia called on tuesday for a halt to the 
us buildup saying american troops should be replaced by an arab 
or un peacekeeping force 
still most of the nations large church organizations have 
avoided judging bushs decision to send us troops to defend saudi 
arabia and try to force iraq out of kuwait 
in the 53 millionmember roman catholic church archbishop 
daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the national 
conference of catholic bishops said only that he was praying for a 
peaceful solution so that the soldiers sailors and air men of 
all forces now arrayed in the region may soon be restored to their 
families 
presiding bishop edmond l browning of the 25 millionmember 
episcopal church of which bush is a member urged the president 
not to allow national pride to obstruct negotiations

opponents of the robert mapplethorpe photo exhibit 
lost a bid in court wednesday to halt the show they say violates 
obscenity laws 
boston municipal clerk magistrate rosemary carr denied three 
complaints against the exhibit which would have prompted an 
investigation by the district attorney 
carr said personally i wouldnt pay five cents for the 
pictures but she moved quickly to deny the request by the american 
family association 
the group had sought a ruling that the exhibit which includes 
nude photos of children is exploitative constitutes 
dissemination of obscene materials and dissemination of matter 
harmful to minors 
lesley pasquini who filed the complaints against the institute 
of contemporary art said members of her group will discuss their 
next step were going to keep making people aware of whats 
going on and whats being pushed before the public she said 
but museum attorney cassandra warshowsky said the exhibit is 
protected 
there is an exemption in the obscenity statutes for 
exhibitions in a bona fide museum school or library warshowsky

a former call girl was slain within a day after 
she went to a party thrown in 1985 by officials of the sincefailed 
vernon savings amp loan of texas according to court documents 
the lavish allnight party allegedly was paid for with 10000 
in bank funds vernon savings officials spent more than 500000 on 
rent for the house during a threeyear period in the mid1980s 
according to court documents 
a former call girl who has been questioned by homicide 
detectives told the the san diego union that donna gentile 22 was 
present at the june 21 1985 party at a northern san diego county 
beach house 
gentile also was a sometime police informant 
her nude body was found at dawn on june 23 the coroner 
estimated she had been dead 10 to 15 hours before she was found off 
a rural highway eastern san diego county gravel had been stuffed 
in her mouth the newspaper reported 
if the date of the party is close to that and we know 
donna was a talker if that is what was happening there could be 
all sorts of motives for her death other than what we are looking 
at now a law enforcement source told the union 
shortly before her slaying gentile had testified at a city 
civil service commission hearing about alleged misconduct by some 
officers 
assistant police chief norm stamper has been working with the 
san diego metropolitan homicide task force in its search for links 
among the slayings of gentile and 42 other women mostly 
prostitutes their bodies have been found in remote parts of san 
diego county since 1985 
the former call girl has been interviewed repeatedly by 
detectives but had not mentioned seeing gentile at that party her 
statements are the first disclosure of gentiles presumed 
whereabouts immediately before her slaying the newspaper said 
wednesday 
if that is the date of the party then it is of 
importance chief deputy district attorney brian michaels said 
the former call girl characterized the financiers as frequent 
customers of karen wilkening who is serving a prison sentence for 
operating a san diegoarea call girl ring 
i knew that vernon gang really well she said they 
spent a lot of money and had a lot of parties on yachts

institution is accused of spending several hundred thousand 
dollars of vernon funds on prostitutes hunting trips political 
contributions yacht trips antique cars and the beach house

i wouldnt be surprised by anything coming up so i wouldnt 
want to foreclose anything but i dont want to suggest that the 
prosecution would attempt to make this part of the case against 
dixon in dallas us attorney marvin collins said in dallas

republican us sen mitch mcconnell has 
called out a familiar pair of bloodhounds to track down votes in 
his campaign for reelection this year 
the dogs which appear in one of mcconnells new television 
spots are the same ones that were given some credit for his 1984 
ouster of democratic incumbent walter dee huddleston in the 
original ads the bloodhounds were dispatched to search for 
huddleston at resorts where he was paid to give speeches while the 
senate was in session 
this time mcconnell is using the hounds to send the message 
that he will be in washington to vote on issues of concern to 
kentuckians 
remember that ad mcconnell asks in the new spot which 
first aired tuesday it was funny but the point was dead 
serious in the last campaign i made a commitment to the people of 
kentucky i said i wouldnt miss a single vote to collect a 
speaking fee and ive kept that pledge 
mcconnell does collect fees for making speeches and has opposed 
efforts to prohibit such fees saying a ban on that form of income 
would be unfair because many senators own property that generates 
outside income 
in the ad mcconnell tells viewers his sixyear 
votingattendance record is 99 percent one of the best in the 
entire senate being on the job is the most important thing a 
senator has to do 
the ad doesnt mention his current democratic opponent former 
louisville mayor and jefferson county judgeexecutive harvey sloane

iowas rivals for governor launched 
their fall television blitz with mild commercials focusing on 
family and their records 
gop gov terry branstad on tuesday began airing a 30second spot 
boosting his role in developing the states economy 
his democratic challenger don avenson began his drive last 
week with one commercial introducing voters to his family and 
another featuring avenson talking about his efforts to push clean 
water legislation 
branstad campaign manager david roederer said the television 
spots build on radio commercials the campaign began last month 
underscoring branstads efforts to manage the state during the 
economic turmoil of the 1980s 
theyll start folding in some testimonials on economic 
development said roederer 
house speaker avensons commercials are designed to soften his 
image by playing on his family and connection to popular 
environmental programs said spokeswoman susy robinette 
both camps insisted they were staying away from hardhitting 
negative commercials the governors race is generally considered 
competitive though branstad has built a big edge in campaign 
finances

american women who are part of the military 
buildup in saudi arabia may have to get used to cultural 
differences that put them in a subservient role the white house 
said wednesday 
it is something our military is grappling with said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater describing it as just one of 
many similar kinds of cultural situations that our service men and 
women are running into there 
the saudi expect female soldiers to conform to such cultural 
practices as not allowing women to shop alone the culture bars 
socializing or having personal contact even for business with a 
member of the opposite sex who is not a relative 
the pentagon did get a special exemption from the saudi 
government to allow women to drive trucks forklifts and other 
vital equipment saudi women are not allowed to drive 
when shopping female soldiers must be accompanied by a male who 
makes the purchases while the woman stands with her eyes downcast 
to avoid offending the male shopkeeper 
we are working on it fitzwater said when asked whether the 
administration was trying to remedy the situation our commanders 
are working with the saudis and trying to develop new programs and 
processes for living there that can accommodate both cultures

an extract from pokeweed plants can hamper 
reproduction of the aids virus within infected cells suggesting a 
possible new approach to treating infected people researchers say 
in testtube experiments the extract worked in tiny amounts 
that did not disturb key functions in uninfected cells researchers 
said 
the work is reported in thursdays issue of the british journal 
nature by scientists from oncogen in seattle the veterans 
administration medical center in san diego and the university of 
minnesota in minneapolis 
pokeweed contains clusters of purplishwhite flowers and 
reddishpurple berries it grows in north america and its roots 
and berry seeds are poisonous 
researchers purified a substance called pokeweed antiviral 
protein from the leaves of the plant 
they mixed it with proteins called monoclonal antibodies which 
targeted the dose to cells infected by the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
this mixture called a conjugate strongly inhibited 
reproduction of the aids virus in blood cells called t cells from

three radical leftists will plead guilty to 
setting off bombs at the us capitol and seven other sites and 
the government has agreed to drop charges against three other 
people 
laura j whitehorn linda s evans and marilyn j buck are 
scheduled to plead guilty friday in us district court here to 
participating in a conspiracy to set off the eight bombs that 
damaged property but caused no injuries according to court papers 
filed last week in federal court 
the nov 7 1983 blast at the capitol blew a hole in a wall 
outside the senate chambers damaging five paintings and knocking 
the door to democratic leader robert byrds office off its hinges 
as part of the deal government prosecutors agreed to drop 
bombing charges against three other members of the leftist group 
who are serving lengthy prison sentences for possession of 
explosives 
the six defendants are members of a radical group that variously 
identified itself as the armed resistance unit the revolutionary 
fighting group and the red guerrilla resistance unit 
the group is linked to the 16 million armed robbery of a 
brinks armored car near nyack ny in 1981 in which two policemen 
and a guard were killed buck is serving a 50year sentence for 
participating in the brinks holdup and four other armed robberies 
the plea agreement filed by us attorney jay b stephens said 
the disposition of the bombing case was in the interest of 
justice but gave no reason for why the government agreed to 
settle the case 
lawyers familiar with the case said a may supreme court decision 
in a new york case on the issue of double jeopardy figured in the 
governments willingness to drop the charges against susan l 
rosenberg timothy a blunk and alan berkman 
rosenberg and blunk are serving 58year sentences for possessing 
more than 600 pounds of explosives they were caught loading the 
explosives into a rented storage bin in cherry hill nj in 1984 
berkman a physician is serving a 10year term for possession 
of explosives weapons and false identify cards when he was 
arrested in 1985 in doylestown pa 
a seventh defendant in the case elizabeth duke is a fugitive 
in 1989 us district judge harold h greene dismissed the 
bombing charges against rosenberg blunk and berkman ruling that 
the evidence in the case had already been used to convict them of 
the earlier firearms charges 
the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia 
reinstated the charges saying the new indictment did not violate 
the rules against double jeopardy 
but the defense renewed its doublejeopardy claims last spring 
after the supreme court said in a new york case that prosecutors 
cannot bring charges based on evidence that had already been used 
to convict the defendant of a different offense 
greene has not ruled on that motion 
whitehorn 45 buck 43 and evans 43 agreed to plead guilty 
to conspiracy and destruction of government property each could 
be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison 
whitehorn also agreed to plead guilty to fraud in connection 
with possession of false identification documents that the fbi 
found during a 1985 raid on her baltimore apartment the charge 
carries a fiveyear prison term 
prosecutors agreed to drop other baltimore charges against 
whitehorn 
in addition to the explosion at the capitol bombs were 
detonated outside the national war college at fort mcnair here 
april 26 1983 the washington navy yard computer center on aug 
18 1983 and the washington navy yard officers club on april 20 
1984 
bombs were also placed at the fbis office on staten island 
ny on jan 28 1983 the israeli aircraft industries building in 
new york on april 5 1984 the south african consulate in new york 
on sept 26 1984 and the new york patrolmens benevolent 
association on feb 23 1985

persian gulf arrived in the united states on wednesday weary from 
a 20hour flight but thrilled to be back 
im happy to be home said taleb subh 15 of davenport 
iowa who had been visiting aunts and uncles in kuwait when iraq 
invaded the country aug 2 
he said he went to the us embassy where officials snuck 
him to baghdad 
they took care of me said taleb who was among five men 
nine women and 10 children who flew home aboard a virgin atlantic 
airways boeing 747 
the group was among 29 americans who began the journey to 
freedom in jordan on tuesday said lori levin an airline 
spokeswoman she said she did not know why five of the americans 
decided to stop in london rather than make the flight to the newark 
norik checkosky of middletown came to the airport to meet her 
mother zaroohi babooriam who had been in iraq visiting relatives 
right now she seems physically ill she looks very bad ms 
checkosky said 
she said she learned in a telephone call from her mother tuesday 
that the freedom plane would arrive wednesday 
she said she was just fine tired but fine ms checkosky 
said 
the virgin atlantic boeing 747 landed about 320 pm at newark 
international airport and passengers were expected to spend at 
least an hour passing through us customs before they could leave 
the airport or catch connecting flights 
we welcome these people home lucinda florio wife of gov 
jim florio said in presenting yellow roses to nithal george who 
was traveling from iraq with her three children ages 11 7 and 2 en 
route to san jose calif 
representatives of the american red cross met the former 
hostages at the airport to smooth their return 
well make flight arrangements said jane frotton director 
of emergency services for the red cross essex county chapter 
the americans who were among 11000 westerners believed to be 
stranded in kuwait and iraq traveled through amman jordan and to 
london before arriving in newark 
the plane loaded with medical supplies and food had flown to 
jordan on monday and had clearance to land in baghdad but was 
unable to do so because such supplies would have violated the trade 
embargo against iraq ms levin said the supplies 2 tons of 
flour 25000 blankets and 2 tons of medical supplies were 
requested by jordans king hussein 
the hostages freed by iraq made their way to jordan for the 
flight home 
though hundreds of westerners were allowed to leave baghdad on 
tuesday and wednesday iraqi red tape kept many others waiting 
the iraqi news agency on wednesday quoted an unidentified 
government spokesman as saying iraq was trying to speed the 
departure of foreign women and children 
the news agency said all border points were open for their 
departure and the iraqi airways was ready to lease its aircraft 
for flying them to any capital 
iraqi president saddam hussein has said women and children can 
leave but foreign men are being kept behind as human shields 
against any us attack on strategic sites

the fourth person to head panamas 
national police since the us invasion in december has been fired 
after writing a letter to a newspaper in response to corruption 
allegations 
lt col fernando quezada was replaced provisionally by ebrahim 
asvat who becomes the first civilian in 40 years to head panamas 
security forces asvat also is the public security director for the 
interior and justice department 
the president has separated lt col fernando quezada from 
his post as directorgeneral of the public force because of an 
absolutely unacceptable public letter said a communique issued 
late tuesday by president guillermo endaras office 
quezada was fired after he sent a letter to la prensa publisher 
roberto eisenmann and fax copies to news organizations protesting a 
story published tuesday 
according to the story the former head of the antiterrorist 
unit ramon diaz said quezada received 25000 from ousted 
dictator manuel antonio noriega but later tried to depose the 
strongman 
quezadas letter recalled noriegas charges of gross personal 
misconduct against eisenmann 
asvat said wednesday that quezada will remain on the police 
force at his present rank but without specific duties 
the public force replaces the panama defense forces which were 
headed by noriega 
although many current officers are former defense forces 
personnel the new department was converted to a civilian force and 
placed under the interior ministry after noriega was driven from 
power during the us invasion 
asvat told the associated press on wednesday that from now on 
the civilian force will accept cadets only from police academies 
not military schools 
after noriega was taken to miami to face us drugtrafficking 
charges col roberto armijo took over the public force but was 
replaced when a bank account of more than 1 million was found in 
his name 
a deputy aristides valdonedo took the job but was fired when 
he was linked to the arson of a building of which eisenmann was 
part owner 
he was replaced by col eduardo herrera hassan who retired aug 
22 quezada was named to the post after four civilians turned it

attorneys for a former nazi guard argued 
wednesday that he should not be stripped of us citizenship 
because he knew nothing about the killings at the concentration 
camp where he served during the holocaust 
the justice department has sought since 1988 to denaturalize 
retired janitor michael schmidt on charges he illegally obtained a 
visa to the united states shortly after world war ii 
the government argued before the 7th circuit us court of 
appeals that schmidt 67 failed to meet visa requirements because 
he aided in the deaths of more than 100000 people at the 
sachsenhausen prison outside of berlin 
therefore his naturalization was illegally procured said 
ronnie eddlman an assistant us attorney 
but schmidts attorney george collins said his client worked 
only as a guard at sachsenhausen and knew nothing about the 
extermination of prisoners collins said that on his visa 
application schmidt acknowledged he had served with the 
schutzstaffel or ss the elite military unit of the nazi party 
that served as a special police force 
this is not visa fraud collins told the threejudge panel 
the only thing before you is whether a man at a prison should be 
denaturalized for things that went on inside that prison which he 
didnt know about 
collins argued that schmidt a native of romania wasnt privy 
to events inside the camp because he only patrolled its perimeter 
as an ss guard and escorted prisoners to work outside the camp 
schmidt was 20 at the time 
ms eddlman urged the appellate court to uphold the decision 
earlier this year of the us district court for the northern 
district of illinois which ordered that schmidt be denaturalized 
it is not credible that the person did not have knowledge of 
the killings inside the prison camp she said 
collins disagreed 
the evidence against him that he was there should be no 
presumption of guilt collins said 
schmidt who lives in suburban lincolnwood refused to comment 
after the hearing his wife son and daughter who also refused to 
comment attended the 25minute proceedings with about 20 neighbors 
and friends 
he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time said a 
neighbor gerhard taraschewsky 
schmidt would have to leave the country if the lower courts 
ruling is affirmed the appellate court took the arguments under 
advisement and did not say when it might rule

students in two school districts 
traded in their books for rakes to help harvest a bumber crop of 
wild blueberries giving them a reprieve on the start of classes 
this years crop already exceeds the record 523 million pounds 
harvested in 1988 officials say and its more than double the 26 
million pounds processed last year they say 
as a result hundreds of students in the cherryfield and machias 
areas in eastern maine who were scheduled to return to school 
wednesday wont go back to classes until monday 
the crop is unusually large and the blueberry industry means a 
great deal to the economy of this area said william clark 
superintendent of school union 102 in machias 
the school district that serves cherryfield and eight 
neighboring towns agreed in late june to a request by blueberry 
processors to move back the start of the school year to accommodate 
what was already shaping up to be a bountiful harvest 
the abnormally large amount of fruit is attributed to good 
growing weather adequate rain the year before to form the flower 
buds sufficient snow cover to prevent winter kill and good 
pollinating weather in the spring 
the blueberry yield also was helped by the more than 30000 
beehives imported into maine to bolster the native pollinators 
the bees were out there working real hard said edward j 
mclaughlin executive director of the maine blueberry commission 
maines wild blues are frozen and sold primarily to large 
food processors theyre used in such products as pancakes and 
muffin mixes 
although mechanical harvesters were introduced in some areas of 
the areas most of the raking is still done by hand rakers 
generally earn about 150 a day although the fastest workers have 
been known to make over 200 
school children who work in the fields count on the cash to buy 
winter clothes or save for college 
a typical kid might make 60 a day which is pretty good if 
youre 13 or 14 years old said russell libby of the state 
department of agriculture 
teachers also take part in the harvest we have two who are 
foremen on the receiving docks said joseph white superintendent 
of school administrative district 37 in harrington

president bush said wednesday that the united 
states is making progress in the war on drugs but two key 
congressmen said the yearold program isnt doing enough to help 
impoverished americans 
drug czar william j bennett and president bush cannot deny 
that we are losing the drug war in our inner cities said rep 
john conyers jr dmich chairman of the house committee on 
government operations 
prevention and education efforts directed at the educated 
middle class appear to be having a dramatic effect conyers said 
treatment programs have room for clients who can afford to pay 
however the chronically addicted cannot pay when they are poor and 
unemployed as is often the case 
rep charles b rangel chairman of the house select committee 
on narcotics abuse and control agreed with conyers criticisms 
saying the statistics showing improvement primarily pertain to the 
middle class 
unfortunately the administrations antidrug strategy has not 
been responsive to the concerns of inner city and other chronic 
drug abusers whose drug abuse is fueling the crisis in our 
emergency rooms in our criminal justice system and in our 
treatment centers said rangel dny 
bush and bennett the presidents chief lieutenant in the drug 
war emphasized the positive in speeches and a white paper released 
wednesday the first anniversary of the presidents announcement of 
his war on drugs 
i think america is making progress against drugs and will 
continue to do so bush said but he acknowledged that the war is 
far from won 
there is still too much violence too much destruction too 
many innocent victims he told a gathering of staff and 
reporters drugs are still an international menace 
and he committed his administration to remain on the front 
lines until this scourge is licked for good even as the 
government seems preoccupied with the persian gulf crisis 
i know that other subjects preoccupy all of us these days but 
this one remains no 1 will continue to remain no 1 when the 
international situation has calmed down bush said 
the president said that signs of progress included americans 
increasing hostility toward drugs declines in casual drug use law 
enforcement successes at home and in latin america and the 
reduction in cocaine supplies 
cocaine bush said is harder to find more expensive less 
pure than it was just one year ago 
conyers however urged revising the federal drug budget to 
spend as much on treatment and prevention as is spent on law 
enforcement the current split is almost 70 percent for law 
enforcement with the remainder going for treatment and prevention 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee released a report citing some successes of the 
drug war and some failures including an increased number of 
murders this year inadequate drug education and lack of treatment 
for pregnant or incarcerated addicts 
much progress has been made in fighting drug use but 
declarations of victory in the drug war are still far away biden 
said 
new york city police commissioner lee brown appearing before 
bidens committee wednesday said initial enthusiasm over the war 
on drugs was dampened by a lack of sufficient federal funds for 
local lawmen 
new york he said was designated a high intensity drug area 
under the program and made eligible for increased funding but he 
said none of the 4 million in additional aid went directly to 
local police 
the national drug control strategy needs redirecting he 
said 
los angeles police chief daryl gates told the panel that the 
drug strategy may not be perfect but i think it is a good one 
bennett director of national drug control policy said 
wednesday that he was not declaring any victories but simply 
publicizing signs that the situation may not be as bleak as it once 
appeared 
he said that when he was confirmed to his job 18 months ago 
most commentators friends and critics both described the work 
ahead in almost apocalyptic terms the drug crisis was hopeless 
beyond control getting worse with no end in sight 
now he said the drug problem in general nationwide is 
no longer getting worse and in some very significant aspects it is 
now getting better not victory but success 
bush made the drug strategy announcement sept 5 1989 in his 
first primetime televised speech

an international commission found wednesday that 
the soviet government issued misleading statements on the fate of 
raoul wallenberg the swedish diplomat credited with saving tens of 
thousands of hungarian jews from the nazis during world war ii 
wallenberg vanished after the soviets arrested him in budapest 
in 1945 in the wars final days on allegations he spied for 
germany moscow later said he had died 
wallenbergs relatives say they received reports he is alive 
under detention in the soviet union he would now be 77 
the 25member private commission composed of soviet swedish 
us and canadian members said its investigation of the conduct of 
soviet authorities in the case brings into question their moral 
standing in the matter 
wallenberg a member of a prominent family of bankers and 
industrialists repeatedly risked his life by hiding jews in houses 
he bought or rented often with his own money shortly before 
budapest was liberated he persuaded the nazis to cancel a plan to 
kill 70000 jews still living in the citys ghetto 
in 1981 the united states made wallenberg an honorary citizen 
swedish authorities presented the kremlin with witnesses 
reports in the 1950s and 1960s that wallenberg was alive and was 
seen by nonsoviets at vladimir prison 12 miles outside moscow 
the soviets responded with the gromyko memorandum of feb 6 
1957 saying they investigated reports from vladimir prison and 
concluded wallenberg died of a heart attack in moscows lubyanka 
prison in 1947 
this year the soviets opened some archives to foreign 
investigators for the first time and let the commission hold 
interviews and search files at vladimir prison 
we have found that the soviet union never conducted any 
investigation at vladimir prison said the report issued at a 
news conference by the newly formed sovietinternational joint 
commission on the fate and whereabouts of raoul wallenberg 
it found that despite soviet claims of having investigated the 
case prison archives were not examined prison officials were 
not interviewed and witnesses whose testimony was relevant were 
not examined 
this finding is particularly disturbing and painful as the 
soviet union continued to receive testimony from the swedish 
government in the 1950s based largely on witness testimony from 
imprisoned foreign nationals at vladimir prison who had left the 
soviet union that raoul wallenberg was alive in the 1950s 
yet for 12 years from 194557 the soviet union insisted that 
raoul wallenberg is not in the soviet union and he is not known to 
us 
quoting from the gromyko memorandum named after the late soviet 
foreign minister andrei a gromyko kremlin authorities looked into 
the matter and could not find any information whatsoever about 
wallenberg being in the soviet union none of those 
interrogated knew anything about wallenberg 
accordingly the commissions finding that no investigation had 
ever been conducted by the soviet union at vladimir prison not only 
discredits the gromyko memorandum and the soviet position that 
wallenberg died in 1947 but brings into question their moral 
standing to make any claim whatever in the absence of any 
investigation by them it said 
the commission also found that the kgb secret police kept its 
own files on incarcerated foreigners 
accordingly the commission finds it rather incredulous that 
the kgb claimed to have discovered by accident in october 1989 
items belonging to raoul wallenberg prison registration card 
passport money personal belongings and which it turned over to 
the wallenberg family during their visit 
indeed the former director of archives at vladimir 
found this kgb claim to be rather ludicrous 
moreover the kgb had previously claimed for 32 years that it 
had no information or materials whatsoever relating to raoul 
wallenberg 
members of the commission include wallenbergs brother guy von 
dardel of sweden irwin cotler of canada marvin w markinen an 
american professor who formerly was incarcerated at vladimir 
prison cronid lubarsky another former vladmir inmate and rolf 
bjornerstedt a former united nations assistant secretary it also 
included five soviets

an aquarium director was reconsidering plans to 
trade an aggressive unsociable show dolphin to the navy after news 
of the deal set off a wave of protests from animalrights activists 
the new england aquarium and the navy worked out the swap which 
would have enlisted rainbow an 11yearold male in the secret 
underwater mammal program at the naval ocean systems center in san 
diego 
aquarium director john h prescott said wednesday that the angry 
public reaction prompted him to rethink the trade 
i think the decision is good for the animals concerned 
prescott said but if its causing public concern i must pay 
attention its not a closed issue 
rainbow 8foot2 and 450 pounds is a bluegray bottlenose 
dolphin one of three show dolphins at the aquarium it became 
cantankerous as it matured 
prescott sought a swap rainbow for a female 
other aquariums refused but the navy center which looks after 
studies and trains 142 marine mammals including 109 dolphins 
eventually agreed to take rainbow in exchange for a partly deaf 
female 
the center trains dolphins in underwater surveillance and 
detecting locating and marking objects for recovery other details 
are are classified said tom lapuzza a spokesman at the san diego 
center 
the trade was delayed because the military buildup in the 
persian gulf took navy planes that could have been used to 
transport rainbow 
news of the deal got out thursday and animal rights activists 
raised an outcry 
we have been attempting to persuade the aquarium not to 
capture wild dolphins and whales our efforts are more urgent 
now that we learn that the aquarium is acting as a clearinghouse 
for animals for the military the boston marine mammal coalition 
said in a statement 
a protest at the aquarium was set for saturday 
the aquarium got so many calls it recorded a message to 
intercept them inviting anyone concerned about rainbow to send a 
letter 
national interest in the navy dolphins was galvanized by reports 
in 1988 that 13 dolphins in navy training had died between 1986 and 
1988 nearly half the animals suffered from lack of appetite or 
stomach ulcers before their deaths the report said other causes 
were hepatitis and pneumonia 
a federal marine mammal commission probe found no major problems 
in the program no navy animals have died in the past 13 months 
lapuzza said 
then in may a former trainer told the media that bottlenose 
dolphins with 45caliber guns mounted on their snouts were being 
trained by the navy to kill enemy frogmen 
lapuzza denies such claims 
the navy has never trained marine mammals to kill people and 
will never do so lapuzza said we do not train mammals to 
perform operations that will put them in danger 
the navy did use dolphins for military work in vietnam and in 
1986 and 1987 in the persian gulf however lapuzza said he 
refused to say what the mammals did there arent any immediate 
plans to use dolphins in the gulf crisis he said 
the aquarium has given the navy three dolphins since 1980 all 
animals it couldnt take for various reasons prescott said 
praising the care the military gives the animals 
the boston controversy coincides with a similar one in 
washington state in silverdale wash wednesday night the navy 
planned to hear public concerns about the navys intention to use 
dolphins to guard trident submarines at bangor wash 
the hearing is part of a settlement reached after 15 animal 
rights groups sued the navy in april 1989 claiming that bringing 
the warmwater dolphins to the colder waters of hood canal required 
an environmental assessment under the national environmental policy 
act 
the suit was dropped when the navy agreed to make that 
assessment

the bush administration said wednesday four 
days before the ussoviet summit that it would take a fresh look 
at economic aid for the soviet union in light of moscows real 
and very helpful support in the persian gulf 
the administration had previously rejected the idea but 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the soviet 
cooperation in the gulf has impressed us to the point where we are 
even more interested in being supportive economically if we can 
be 
meanwhile the white house announced that president bush would 
address a joint session of congress next tuesday night after 
returning from his weekend summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev bushs topics aides said would include the summit and 
the gulf crisis 
according to a white house statement bush had brought up the 
idea of the joint session appearance earlier in the day in 
conversations with house speaker thomas s foley dwash and 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
speaker foley extended an invitation to the president on 
behalf of both chambers the statement said 
white house aides said that the speech would deal primarily with 
the persian gulf crisis but that bush would also give lawmakers a 
rundown on his session in helsinki with gorbachev 
in presummit comments white house officials seemed to be going 
out of their way to praise the soviets 
fitzwater said he was certain the issue of western economic aid 
to moscow would come up at sundays summit the administration 
opposed direct economic aid as recently as last july at the 
economic summit of seven industrial nations in houston 
but fitzwater said of the soviets they have sent ships to 
the gulf they have been supportive president gorbachev has made 
some strong public statements of support for the unbacked 
trade embargo against iraq 
he said gorbachevs words have a political impact in the world 
of countries that have formally been aligned with the soviet union 
that is very hard to measure but one which we know is real and has 
been very helpful 
furthermore fitzwater said the united states is willing to 
talk with the soviet union about a longstanding soviet proposal 
revived on tuesday by foreign minister eduard shevardnadze for a 
middle east peace conference 
the conference which the united states long has opposed would 
seek to resolve all conflicts in the region including the 
arabisraeli dispute 
in the past moscow has been iraqs principal arms supplier 
however after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the kremlin cut 
off arms sales although several hundred soviet military advisers 
remained in iraq 
some lawmakers back from visits to the middle east urged bush 
at the white house on wednesday to press gorbachev to pull russian 
military advisers out of iraq and to provide the united states with 
intelligence information on iraqs military capability 
but as to the military advisers fitzwater said there is no 
sense in getting argumentative with the soviets on this issue 
fitzwater portrayed the continued presence of the soviet 
advisers as a marginal problem and not one that threatened the 
effectiveness of the embargo against iraq 
the spokesman said that bush wants to discuss with gorbachev the 
status of an international monetary fund review of soviet economic 
needs 
the study was commissioned at the houston summit as a compromise 
between the united states which opposed direct economic aid to the 
soviets and west germany and france which favored it 
noting reports of bread shortages and other economic 
deprivations in the soviet union fitzwater said well be very 
interested in president gorbachevs analysis of what his problems 
are and whether or not the west can be helpful and in what areas 
fitzwater said he did not expect a final resolution of the 
economic aid issue at helsinki 
meanwhile administration officials said it now seems unlikely 
that bush will stop in brussels on his way home from helsinki to 
brief allies on the gorbachev summit as had been discussed 
earlier 
the white house said bush had decided to postpone until later in 
the month a political trip to colorado and california that had been 
scheduled for next tuesday and wednesday

democrats rallied wednesday around 
their landslide gubernatorial primary winner lawton chiles who 
launched whats expected to be a tough general election campaign 
against republican gov bob martinez 
in nevada political newcomer jim galloway opened his republican 
gubernatorial campaign by trying to draw democratic incumbent gov 
bob miller into a debate 
floridas firstterm governor was spoiling for a fight saying 
in tampa that hed leave the rallies to the democrats 
weve had the unity we dont need the rally said martinez 
who got 69 percent of the vote in tuesdays gop primary 
democratic officeholders ranging from sen bob graham to county 
commissioners joined about 250 people wednesday on the steps of the 
capitol to celebrate the victory by the man nicknamed walkin 
lawton 
chiles and running mate kenneth buddy mackay of ocala a 
former congressman got 69 percent of the vote and carried 65 of 67 
counties in defeating bill nelson a sixterm congressman from 
melbourne 
nelson criticized chiles sharply during the campaign for 
accepting what he called sweetheart financial deals 
he also suggested that chiles wasnt healthy enough to handle 
the governors office chiles had said he was burned out when he 
decided in 1988 against reelection to the us senate and later 
revealed hed been taking antidepressant drugs 
on wednesday nelson called that a family fight and said he 
and his running mate house speaker tom gustafson were committed 
to supporting the chilesmackay ticket 
i decided to come here today not just to say pretty words but 
to suggest some things i could do nelson said later he went to 
the chiles headquarters to telephone supporters about contributing 
to the party nominee 
chiles said he held no grudges the enduring friendship that 
we have and have had over the years did endure 
according to complete but unofficial vote totals chiles got 
739916 votes or 69 percent to nelsons 325448 votes or 31 
percent in the gop race martinez got 457952 votes also 69 
percent to state sen marlene woodson howards 131782 votes or 
20 percent three other candidates split the rest of the republican 
vote 
chiles has run well ahead of martinez in most polls but the 
governor has begun to close the gap recently martinez has a huge 
campaign war chest ready for the campaign and plans a new 
television ad blitz beginning this week 
martinez called for debates before journalists which chiles has 
said he doesnt like he said he did not intend to bring up 
questions of chiles health but hinted that voters should watch the 
democratic nominee closely 
people will make that judgment how healthy he is by the 
vigor he may show how he addresses debates or does he stay vague 
does he speak on the issues martinez said 
in nevada it was the challenger gallaway who said he wanted 
to get the governor out from behind his desk to debate 
final results of the voting were delayed by massive computer 
failures in the las vegas area where most of the states voters 
live clark county election officials blamed computer glitches 
poorly trained volunteers and soggy ballots for a vote count fiasco 
that left some local candidates guessing their fate the day after 
the election 
but nearly complete returns showed miller who is seeking a full 
term in the job he inherited two years ago winning the democratic 
primary with 66998 votes or 81 percent he was followed by none 
of the above a protest option on all nevada ballots that 
tallied 6754 votes or 8 percent and a longshot hopeful named 
rhinestone cowboy with 2308 votes or 3 percent 
gallaway a businessman and newcomer to nevada politics had 
35628 votes or 50 percent in his eightway gop race none of 
the above drew 15637 votes or 22 percent and builder charlie 
brown had 14966 votes or 21 percent

antiapartheid course irreversible president fw de klerk on 
wednesday invited groups of all races to join negotiations on a new 
constitution 
now is the time to wipe out petty differences he said 
the government and african national congress were scheduled to 
continue talks thursday despite tension over the armys 
involvement in a township shooting that killed 11 people 
an anc spokeswoman said she knew of no change in the plans for 
thursdays meeting 
anc leader nelson mandela visited black townships near 
johannesburg wracked by fighting that has killed more than 550 
people since aug 12 
mandela repeated accusations that police fueled the fighting by 
siding with zulu backers of the conservative inkatha movement 
against xhosas and other blacks loyal to the anc police deny the 
charges and say they have prevented the violence from escalating 
defense minister gen magnus malan said black leaders appeared 
unable to control their followers and should stop blaming police 
and soldiers for the unrest 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi said a meeting with mandela 
could help curb the violence but mandela has refused such a 
meeting 
the anc blames inkatha for starting the recent fighting but an 
inkatha youth leader accused the anc on wednesday of trying to wipe 
out his groups members 
the townships were reported quiet wednesday after a day in which 
40 people were killed 
a momentum has begun which is making the negotiation process

a member of the house democratic leadership 
angered by japans slow response to aid the united states in the 
persian gulf crisis on wednesday called for forcing the asian 
nation to pay for us troops stationed in japan 
rep david bonior dmich the fourth ranking democrat in the 
house said he wrote his measure which will be offered when the 
house considers the fiscal 1991 defense bill before iraqs 
invasion of kuwait last month 
but the chief deputy majority whip said the amendment is 
needed now more than ever 
japan has announced that it would supply the united states with 
a 1 billion assistance package but bonior said it seems now that 
the aid will be delayed 
everyone is bellying up and doing their part and theyre 
hanging back i think thats grossly unfair bonior told a news 
conference 
the michigan democrat complained that us forces in the gulf 
region are protecting the oil interests of american allies 
including japan which can afford to pay for its defense as well as 
the defense of oil supplies 
too often we have seen japanese promises and no action they 
should pay a greater share in the persian gulf and they should pay 
for our troops protecting japan bonior said 
according to boniors estimates the united states spends 45 
billion annually to station about 50000 us troops in japan while

a 537 million decadelong study ordered by 
congress concluded thursday that acid rain should be viewed as a 
longterm problem requiring pollution controls but is not the 
environmental crisis some scientists have suggested 
the report by the national acid precipitation assessment program 
was embraced both by those who support steep cuts in sulfur dioxide 
emissions and by critics of such cuts the critics have long 
claimed that severe pollution controls costing as much as 5 
billion a year are an overreaction to the acid rain problem 
in its final draft report the scientific group known as napap 
reiterated that pollutioncontrol measures are needed to return 
hundreds of lakes and streams especially in the northeast and the 
midatlantic states to healthy conditions 
the report also acknowledged that acid rain is affecting 
visibility across much of the east causes damage to some forests 
particularly red spruce at higher elevations reduces soil 
nutrients kills some aquatic life erodes buildings and statutes 
and poses health problems to some humans exposed to acidic aerosols 
james mahoney director of napa outlined the draft report to a 
final meeting of the group and said its findings have reduced the 
scientific uncertainties about acid rain 
acid rain is correctly viewed as a longterm problem which 
should be resolved by permanent measures he concluded 
summarizing the findings 
mahoney said that while the study supports many of the 
scientific views expressed over the years on acid rain it also 
rejected other more extreme views such as those that consider 
it a flatout crisis or those who would say theres no 
problem at all 
napap was established by congress in 1980 to improve the 
understanding of acid rain during its decade of work it spent 537 
million 
the report stopped short of endorsing specific control 
requirements including the 10millionton cut in sulfur dioxide 
emissions required by legislation nearing approval in congress 
the study said however that if annual sulfur dioxide emissions 
were cut by 10 million tons the damaging trends would be reversed 
such emission controls would lead to the chemical recovery of 
lakes in the adirondacks where the acid rain problem is said to be 
most severe and protect lakes in the higher elevations of the 
midatlantic states it also would reduce other damages caused by 
acid rain and improve visibility 
but the pollution controls would not be cheap with the expense 
increasing sharply as steeper emission reductions are put in place 
an 8millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions would cost 
17 billion to 27 billion a year while cuts of 10 million tons 
would cost as much as 4 billion a year the study estimated 
the most severe pollution control requirements would have to be 
imposed on electric utilities especially those burning highsulfur 
coal in the midwest for the results to be effective the study 
said 
the national coal association issued a statement urging that 
congress ease its acid rain pollution controls in light of the 
napap study the report provides strong evidence that there is 
time to implement more costeffective ways in which to mitigate the 
limited environmental impacts of acid rain said richard lawson 
the associations president 
but eileen claussen a senior director involved with air 
pollution issues at the epa said the napap report clearly 
establishes the link between sulfur emissions and environmental 
damage and supports the bush administrations call for tough 
pollution controls by coalburning electric utilities 
president bush has supported legislation calling for utilities 
to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the 
end of the decade clean air legislation approved by the house and 
senate and awaiting action by a conference committee would require 
such reductions

a scandal dubbed israels watergate eclipsed 
news of the persian gulf crisis here wednesday featuring 
accusations of highlevel political fraud and questions on the 
propriety of wiretapping under jewish law 
it rattled nerves in prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
narrowbased coalition cabinet and renewed tension between israels 
two main communities sephardic jews from africa and the middle 
east and ashkanazim of european origin 
national police commissioner yaacov turner under fire for 
investigating interior minister ariyeh deri defended himself 
against charges by deris supporters that the probe began because 
deri is a sephardic jew born in morocco 
its crazy turner said to prevent an investigation they 
are willing to break up an entire people whoever helps this along 
is worse than a criminal 
police minister roni milo of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
likud bloc said he will summon turner on thursday to discuss that 
comment 
a statement from milos office carried by israel television 
said turners comments dealt with issues not related to 
proper functioning of the police force and its national tasks 
the scandal began last week with reports that five people were 
held on suspicion of bugging the telephone of investigative 
reporter mordechai gilat of the newspaper yediot ahronot 
a recorder was found on a motorcycle outside gilats home with 
wires running through his phone box and into his tel aviv apartment 
gilat wrote articles in june that led to police investigation of 
deri 31 a leading member of the ultraorthodox torah guardians 
party known by the hebrew acronym shas deri is suspected of 
misappropriating millions of shekels in government money by 
diverting funds from local councils to religious institutions after 
taking office in december 1988 
a shekel is worth just over 50 cents 
deri denied the charges on national tv both he and police have 
refused to comment on his interrogation by investigators tuesday 
israeli reports said wednesday police also suspected deri had 
advance knowledge about gilats being wiretapped deri has not 
commented 
deris supporters seek to use the tapes as a possible way to 
exonerate him some israeli reports said the recordings contained 
conversations between gilat and turner coordinating their moves 
the issue led to radio discussions by religious experts on what 
jewish law has to say about admitting a wiretap as evidence 
some rabbis argued that 13thcentury sage gershon ben solomon of 
arles france ordered a man punished for reading someone elses 
mail without consent the same principle could be applied to a 
wiretap they reasoned 
rabbi ovadiah yosef of shas a former chief sephardic rabbi 
said nobody could hide his words or deeds from god 
the almighty has a tape with television pictures he was 
quoted as telling followers nobody can go to heaven and claim to 
the creator i never said such things 
deris supporters demand the tapes be declared legal evidence 
and that turner be ousted if found to be in the wrong 
gilat won a supreme court injunction monday barring use of the 
tapes 
questions over turners role also motivated shas leaders to 
charge deri was being persecuted because of his north african 
origins 
it is all a plot against the sephardic community israel 
radio quoted rabbi shabtai atun a shas supporter as saying 
the sephardim comprise about 60 percent of jewish israelis the 
ashkanazim who gained political power in prestate israel still 
dominate the government however 
cabinet members from shas raised the deri issue at sundays 
cabinet meeting news reports said communications minister raphael 
pinchasi of shas won shamirs promise that the fraud probe against 
deri would be carried out quickly before it could upset the 
political balance 
shas has five seats in the 120member parliament but is a key 
player among the 10 parties in shamirs government it brought down 
shamirs coalition with the labor party on march 15 by abstaining 
in a vote of no confidence 
wiretaps also were featured in the watergate scandal that drove 
richard nixon from the presidency in 1974

armenias communist party chief has threatened to 
quit the soviet politburo unless president mikhail s gorbachev can 
restore order in the disputed region of nagornokarabakh news 
reports said wednesday 
meanwhile the armenian parliament passed a resolution 
complaining that citizens of the predominantly armenian territory 
located inside the neighboring republic of azerbaijan are having 
their rights trampled upon the tass news agency reported 
the armenian population of nagornokarabakh continues to be 
subject to terror on the part of azerbaijani authorities assisted 
by units of the soviet army and interior ministry troops tass 
quoted the resolution as saying 
a state of emergency is in effect in the mountainous region 
part of azerbaijan since 1923 ethnic battles between residents of 
the two caucasus republics over who should control the area have 
left more than 200 people dead the past two years 
vladimir movsisyan the communist party leader of armenia said 
in an appeal published in the republics newspapers wednesday that 
indifference and indecision on the part of the soviet leadership 
have given azerbaijans leaders a free hand to pursue an 
antiarmenian policy according to the independent interfax news 
service 
it quoted him as saying misinformation circulated about 
armenians aggressive activity in azerbaijan has put the two 
republics on the verge of war 
movsisyan who as the republics communist party leader is a 
member of the soviet politburo threatened to resign unless the 
nagornokarabakh issue is solved as soon as possible so that 
armenian lives in the region are protected tass and interfax 
reported 
the president of azerbaijan ayaz mutalibov also has accused 
the soviet authorities of inaction in the dispute and he has 
issued a different kind of threat that his republic may secede 
from the soviet union if the kremlin does not act to normalize 
the situation in nagornokarabakh 
mutalibov made the threat in an interview published tuesday in 
the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya 
movsisyan said a natural gas pipeline to yerevan armenias 
capital has been shut off and freight trains have stopped 
arriving in the city of idzhevan costing the republic tens of 
millions of rubles 
in addition azerbaijani authorities are forcing armenians to 
leave their homes in nagornokarabakh in order to change the 
demography of the region the armenian parliaments resolution was 
quoted by tass as saying 
the parliament urged that interior ministry and soviet army 
troops be deployed immediately along the borders of 
nagornokarabakh and adjacent areas to restore soviet authority and 
selfgovernment in the area tass reported 
last week the armenian parliament banned the armenian national 
army created last winter as a vigilante group to protect the 
mostly christian population of armenia from the mostly moslem 
population of azerbaijan lawmakers acted after the militant 
nationalist group was blamed for the shooting deaths of a member of 
parliament and another man 
gorbachev has demanded that militants in the republic disarm and 
disband paramilitary groups but armenian leaders say they can 
police their own population

bar polands biggest daily newspaper from displaying the unions 
logo in another move that reflects the deepening split in the labor 
movements ranks

gdansk voted 2621 with 12 abstentions to take away the union logo 
from the gazeta wyborcza newspaper a newspaper spokeswoman later 
said it would comply with the decision 
solidarity chairman lech walesa was not present for the vote 
walesa in june questioned the use of the logo by gazeta 
wyborcza which is published by a private company the newspaper 
was the first independent daily to be published legally in poland 
after decades of communist rule 
the editorinchief adam michnik defended the dailys right to 
use the logo at that time 
michnik a historian and longtime adviser to walesa stressed in 
a june 6 editorial that the daily was a direct continuation of the 
unions underground press 
after wednesdays vote solidaritys national spokeswoman 
barbara malak announced she was resigning to protest the 
leaderships decision 
the logo was treated as a censorship tool directed against the 
press and other media i had to decide whether or not to accept my 
job as spokeswoman when it comes to using censorship ms malak 
told the pap news agency 
alina bialkowska a senior editor reached at gazetas office 
said the newspaper would remove the solidarity logo and publish a 
statement by the editorial staff on thursday 
the newspaper will remain the same independent like it has 
been all the time she said 
gazeta wyborcza was founded in may 1989 as a result of the 
roundtable agreements that restored solidaritys legal status the 
union was banned by communist authorities after the december 1981 
martial law crackdown 
early editions of the newspaper focused on elections to 
parliament in which solidarity scored easy victories 
although generally supportive of solidarity the daily has 
ceased to be a union mouthpiece since the creation of a 
noncommunist government a year ago it has defended the policies 
of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and taken a lukewarm attitude 
toward walesas ambitions to become polands president 
michnik is a leader of the citizens movement for democratic 
action a recently formed solidarityrelated political group that 
supports mazowiecki the staff of gazeta wyborcza denies it is 
aligned with the group

gov james blanchard chose olivia maynard 
head of the states office on aging as his running mate in a move 
that could placate women and senior citizens angered when he dumped 
78yearold lt gov martha griffiths 
the governor denied picking maynard 54 to mollify those 
interest groups 
the senior citizens and womens groups told him they supported 
his initial decision blanchard said but he added that picking 
maynard will bring a new sense of enthusiasm about his 
democratic ticket 
amid the controversy blanchards republican opponent senate 
majority leader john engler last week chose a state sen connie 
binsfeld 66 as his running mate her selection was expected to be 
ratified at the gop convention which begins friday in detroit 
blanchard had a doubledigit lead over engler in a poll 
conducted in late july 
blanchard seeking his third fouryear term described maynard 
as a fighter for senior citizens and people living on fixed incomes 
i trust her with power i trust her with decisions i trust 
her ability to work and select good people and i trust her with the 
future of this state he said

1983 and has been director of the states office of services to the 
aging since march 1983 
blanchard 48 announced aug 24 that he was replacing griffiths 
on the democratic ticket after two terms because he didnt feel she 
was ready to step in at any moment to take over as governor 
the naming of his new running mate came one day after the crusty 
former congresswoman and longtime fighter for womens rights said 
she wouldnt oppose his decision at the state democratic convention 
this weekend in flint 
the convention which begins friday must ratify blanchards 
choice 
griffiths originally furious about blanchards decision also 
denied a published report she called the governor a son of a 
bitch last week she said the reference was to politicans in 
general who dump someone after getting what they want 
she dodged a question about whether he falls into the same 
category as other politicians saying you be the judge 
griffiths is widely credited with helping blanchard first gain 
the governors office in 1982

a man who won 188000 in floridas lottery 
last year will get a paupers burial after he apparently was 
crushed to death in a trash bin following a night of drinking 
police say roy clark may have spent all the money he won in a 
fantasy five drawing but on wednesday they were looking for any 
relatives in case some cash or property remained 
poof said orange county sheriffs detective tom mccann i 
guess he just blew it 
when clarks body compacted by a garbage truck was found 
friday at the orange county dump there was less than 10 in his 
pocket it was the last of 40 he made the previous day working for 
a labor pool 
police said they didnt know whether clark had anything left to 
show from his winnings 
detectives know that clark 39 spent at least some of his money 
buying rounds of drinks for friends and riding around in 
limousines they traced much of the money through several bank 
accounts he wrote checks for most of it from an account with 
barnett bank in tallahassee 
they said they had heard he invested in several businesses and 
that he bought a condominium in hawaii and land in california 
if true those holdings would go to any heirs but after nearly 
a week of looking for his next of kin police havent found anyone 
friends said he carried a picture of a young girl he said was 
his daughter brandy whom he described as a student at the 
university of new mexico in albuquerque but when detectives 
checked they were told that no one named brandy clark was 
registered there 
when he hit the lottery last september clark had been working 
for a sod company and living in an apartment building in winter 
park he had become friends with the family across the hall chuck 
and sandy herbert 
he moved away after hitting the lottery and detectives said 
they believe he was living with another man in a rented trailer in 
east orange county 
in april the herberts said clark came to see them at their new 
home he told them he was having some legal problems getting his 
winnings from the lottery and needed a place to stay 
until the week before he disappeared clark lived with the 
herberts and their three children they find it hard to believe he 
lied about not getting his winnings 
he was a good man he was always watching the kids for me he 
loved them said sandy herbert every time i look here or 
there i can picture him holding the baby 
he enjoyed snorkeling and watching national geographic nature 
programs she said he didnt drink carouse or take drugs she 
said 
clark told the herberts he would be gone for a few days on a 
business trip with his lawyer to try to get his lottery winnings 
i cant see him leaving like that knowing he wasnt going to 
come back sandy herbert said he had a home here whatever 
happened to him in that week is the answer

apartments gave clues of a careful cautious killer 
ive never been associated with a crime scene that had so many 
violent attacks and so litle evidence left behind west said 
this individual that perpetrated these crimes is not your average 
criminal hes very methodical and very neat he doesnt leave any 
traces of his presence in the crime scenes 
students in gainesville remembered their dead classmates at a 
memorial service in a 10000seat sports center also wednesday

people attending the memorial service 
dr larry w tyree president of santa fe community college 
said with each horrible tragedy the sense of helplessness 
has grown in each of us 
as the grisly job of examining evidence and looking for a killer 
continued investigators divulged more brief glimpses into what 
they have learned about the crimes 
west used an experimental reflective ultraviolet imaging system 
that intensifies light 70000 times to examine two of the three

the four female victims in an apparent attempt to confuse 
investigators about whether the women were sexually assaulted the

found aug 26 the body of miss hoyt 19 was found the next day

this is the most difficult crime scene ive ever seen said 
west who has been a medical examiner for 13 years 
he said hes been able to turn up some fingerprints but the 
odds are they belonged to the residents of the apartments he 
said he hasnt been able to find any prints on the areas we 
believe the perpetrator to have touched moved or manipulated 
despite the filing of unrelated new charges in indian river 
county against edward lewis humphrey for armed burglary and 
attempted sexual battery police said it has not affected his 
position on their pool of eight suspects 
an arrest is not imminent in the slayings said lt spencer

still have no timetable on arrests or legal options 
only humphrey and stephen michael bates a 30yearold lakeland 
shortorder cook have been publicly mentioned as being on the list

since his aug 29 arrest in an unrelated assault case 
police in dothan ala also have contacted gainesville police 
about the may stabbing death of marilyn mitchell a nursing 
graduate from the university of alabama to see if that case is 
related 
polk county authorities have said they doubt bates is the 
killer but his fingerprints have been sent to the task force 
investigating the slayings 
humphrey faces the new charges after he was identified by a 
27yearold woman as the man who attacked her at knifepoint in 
1988 she called police after seeing humphreys picture in a 
newspaper 
he said something or did something in this case that is very 
similar to characteristics of the suspect in gainesville said

cries for help by tens of thousands of 
hungry asians stranded in jordan after fleeing kuwait are finally 
being heard by other nations but there still were concerns 
wednesday that the aid could come too late 
the multitudes now living in makeshift desert camps are 
fighting for food and water and many are on the verge of 
starvation 
jordans crown prince hassan chided the international community 
earlier this week for its slow response to his governments pleas 
for aid 
the international organiztion for migration announced wednesday 
it would begin an airlift thursday to evacuate 19000 people over 
the next two weeks it said it planned 72 flights at a cost of 
about 12 million 
foreign correspondents visiting the stinking camp at salwa near 
ruweishid on the jordanianiraqi border were surrounded by hordes 
of bedraggled bangladeshis and other asian nationals pleading for 
deliverance from the blazing desert 
tell the world we will die here if we are not helped was 
one of the anguished cries heard over and over in the camp on an 
expanse of stony desert 
about 40000 asians are packed into the salwa camp which lacks 
basic sanitary and other amenities 
some are crammed into tents but shelter for most is a womans 
sari spread overhead to provide some shade from the fierce sun the 
severe food shortage has forced people to fight over scraps of 
bread 
the official jordanian news agency petra said wednesday 605277 
evacuees had crossed into jordan since aug 2 when the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait sparked the exodus of foreigners from the two 
countries 
the vast majority of evacuees have left jordan but 105000 
bangladeshis pakistanis indians sri lankans thais and filipinos 
are stranded in camps scattered throughout jordan waiting for 
transportation home petra said 
nearly 20000 more cross into jordan every day but only half 
that number leave daily the agency said 
the west german government announced tuesday it had dispatched 
an 167seat aircraft that over the past 10 days evacuated 6000 
egyptian nationals stranded at jordans red sea port of aqaba 
sweden denmark and norway on wednesday together pledged 14 
million in aid finland pledged 25 million and italy 34 million 
the united nations already has sent more than 3000 metric tons 
of food and other supplies to jordan and received 19 million in 
aid mainly from japan and sweden said robert souria a relief 
official with the agency 
but he added the international community needs to send more 
jordans americanborn queen noor hugged and kissed british 
tycoon richard branson when he flew into the amman airport tuesday 
night aboard a jumbo jet of his virgin atlantic airline laden with 
40 tons of supplies for the 100000 stranded asians on the verge of 
starvation 
we are so grateful we desperately needed this the queen 
told branson 
branson flew back to london with a planeload of western women 
and children hostages who had been allowed to leave iraq 
there is a tremendous amount of concentration on a few british 
and a few american people coming out of iraq branson told 
reporters 
i feel it is slightly embarrassing being there with a big 
plane and there is a refugee camp 10 minutes away with thousands 
and thousands of people from india and bangladesh who may be 
waiting for months to get out 
he said relief efforts should be coordinated by european nations 
to ensure that all aircraft arrive full of provisions and tents 
and return full of westerners

mosbacher and 15 chief executive officers of us companies are 
scheduled to leave for moscow on saturday for a weeklong visit to 
discuss what kind of technical assistance the united states can 
give the soviet union 
during the trip they plan to meet with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev and boris yeltsin president of the russian republic 
said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the bush administration while balking at providing the soviet 
union with cash grants or loans agreed at the economic summit of 
industrial nations in houston in july to provide the technical 
assistance 
about 80 other nations receive american technical assistance 
which can range from developing a flyresistant wheat in morocco to 
bringing down bangladeshs fertility rate 
the soviets need help with improving their transportation 
infrastructure and housing said business leaders who will make the 
trip 
big chunks of money are not what they want they want to have 
the exposure to the management techniques and construction 
techniques and operating techniques that we take for granted 
said mark hungerford chairman and chief executive officer of 
tanscisco industries inc of san francisco a rail car company 
hungerfords company for example is engaged in a joint venture 
with the soviets to help them with a heating system for tank rail 
cars that performs well in cold climates his firm also is helping 
the soviets to better transport petrochemical products 
another transportation firm sealand service inc of edison 
nj will be represented by its chief officer alex j mandl 
sealand specializes in global distribution networks or 
establishing a way for goods to be transported by land and sea 
the trip mandl said gives him a chance to help both president 
bush and his company 
that part of the world is opening up as long as the iron 
curtain was up our distribution network did not participate in 
that part of the world as that wall comes down we have a chance 
to be in there mandl said 
leonard sylk chairman and chief executive officer of shelter 
systems group of hainesport nj said the soviets have been 
interested in his firms expertise because it makes manufactured 
housing components or the roofs floors and walls that largescale 
builders use in putting up houses 
us business leaders stand to gain if the soviet economy 
improves sylk said 
other companies to be represented on the trip are according to 
government sources the archerdanielsmidland co of decatur

irene dunne filled the screen like a good 
vintage champagne in a baccarat crystal goblet 
she was bubbly of course but like that fine champagne hers 
were small neat bubbles compacted with years of flavor and refined 
ever so to explode not all at once but slowly and smoothly and 
surely 
dunne who died tuesday night in her los angeles home at 88 was 
one of the last of that great breed of film actors who delighted 
generations with those romantic frolics known as screwball comedies 
her portrayals were spontaneous unexpected flirty and winsome 
they were tantalizing frothy and intelligent above all they were 
downright funny she may have liked her dramatic roles more i 
remember mama magnificent obsession but comedy made her a 
legend 
she had an offhanded but charming way of delivering lines in a 
voice that sounded like sable brushing diamonds hers was not the 
clipped patrician charm of katharine hepburn or the coquettish 
zaniness of carole lombard her timing was better in a way ask her 
a question and she could say more with a turn of her head and a 
simple ahh than with a long answer or even a yes or 
no 
cary grant paid me one of the loveliest compliments of my 
life she once remarked he said i had the best timing of 
anyone he ever worked with it must be something that comes 
naturally to you my father had a keen sense of humor which i 
think is different from having a sense of humor 
timing and attitude 
its not that im prudish its just that my mother told me 
never to enter any mans room in months ending in r she tells 
charles boyer in love affair a 1939 movie later made into an 
affair to remember with deborah kerr and cary grant 
in the awful truth leo mccareys academy awardnominated 
crazy romp about a divorcing couple who scheme to get back 
together dunne lucy warriner turns the table on costar cary 
grant jerry warriner in the classic lola scene 
she shows up as jerrys alleged strippersister lola at a 
formal dinner party given by his terribly proper fiancee and her 
terribly proper family with an outfit that would make a 
streetwalker proud dunne swings into a stripper number she had 
seen jerrys girlfriend of the moment dixiebelle perform in a 
nightclub dixiebelle had a fan blow her skirts above her head 
during certain lyrics in the song 
lucy sings my dreams have gone with the wind and dunne 
who had a trained lyric soprano voice butchers her singing talents 
in the most vulgar but funny ways 
i used to dream about a cottage small 
a cottage small by the waterfall 
but i wound up with no dreams at all 
my dreams have gone with the wind 
there is no fan as lucy performs the embarrassing number 
instead she makes the wind sounds herself and spreads her legs 
apart this song has some wind effects in it but youll just 
have to use your imagination about them she coos 
earlier in the movie lucy and jerry have a courtroom custody 
battle for their wirehaired terrier mr smith dunne with an 
allknowing and alluring smile at the judge hides the dogs 
favorite squeaky toy in her fur muff he runs to her to prove whom 
he prefers 
love wins out as it always does in these situations despite 
dunnes chilling promise to grant i wouldnt go on living with 
you if you were dipped in platinum 
dunne and grant have another wonderful romp in garson kanins 
my favorite wife in which dunne returns home after being 
shipwrecked and presumed dead for a number of years shes spent 
the time with randolph scott and grant has remarried 
how long does it take to tell a woman my wifes come back 
i can say it in two seconds my wifes come back youve had two 
days she snaps at him 
she also asks oh by the way how was my funeral 
but the urbane charms drop ever so slightly in life with 
father here dunne is understanding loving and the allknowing 
wife to william powells irascible husband 
you know dunne tells zasu pitts in the movie i dont 
believe clare has come right out and told me he loves me since 
weve been married course i know he does because i keep 
reminding him of it you have to keep reminding them 
grant loved working with dunne and once summed up the delightful 
effects of her performance he called it a lovely flirtation

the united states the president of the czechoslovakian 
parliament told a crowd of about 1200 half the population of the 
southern minnesota farming community 
children chanted dubcek dubcek and waved czechoslovakian 
and american flags 
i am especially glad that the new generation that is here does 
not forget the old country he said through a translator 
in an effort to inject life into czechoslovakias sagging 
economy a sixmember delegation including top ministers of 
industry and science is visiting minnesota to learn about medical 
and computer technology 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev made a oneday visit to 
the state in june for similar reasons 
dubcek met with about 100 health care executives tuesday at 
medtronic inc the worlds largest maker of cardiac pacemakers in 
the minneapolis suburb of fridley 
dubcek said at a luncheon address wednesday that the shift from 
a planned economy to a free market system will progress slowly and 
painfully over several years 
destruction of the totalitarian power is not enough he 
said it is necessary to rebuild the economic structure from 
scratch we want to avoid the danger of excess inflation that has 
so badly hit our neighbors in poland and hungary 
that can be spurred by foreign investment and joint ventures 
with american entrepreneurs the czechoslovakian leader said 
our industry is considerably sound even if some of our 
industrial branches may be obsolete he said we have qualified 
workers and technicians who are experienced we have a relatively 
low foreign debt 
earlier dubcek joined local and state officials for breakfast 
at schumachers new prague hotel they ate the czech sausage 
jiternice with horseradish along with biscuits potato dumplings 
and scrambled eggs 
dubcek now 68 was led the 1968 prague spring liberalization 
movement that was crushed by warsaw pact forces last year he 
regained his post as head of parliament following two decades of 
political exile and relative obscurity 
he told a crowd gathered on the steps of the st wenceslaus 
church in new prague that his years of struggle were worth the 
ultimate freedoms gained by his countrymen when they forced out the 
communist government 
as the lessons of history say violence can never last 
forever he said truth and justice will come sometimes 
later but it will always come the best witness of that is my 
good mood as i talk to you here 
i can tell you frankly that to be here i feel i am among 
members of my family he said 
new prague was founded by czech immigrants in the 1870s more 
than 500000 people with eastern europe roots live in minnesota 
state house speaker robert vanasek of new prague called dubcek 
the greatest slovak of the 20th century

richard v secord testified wednesday that a 
former cia agent shared in irancontra arms sale profits but that 
records of the weapons deals were cooked after the scandal 
became public 
the retired air force major general was the leadoff witness in 
the governments tax case against thomas g clines the retired cia 
agent who is accused of underreporting some of his arms sale 
earnings on his 1985 and 1986 tax returns 
the trial in us district court focuses on profits during the 
irancontra affair which involved the sale of arms to iran and 
efforts to supply weapons to the contra rebels in nicaragua at a 
time when congress banned such assistance 
clines 62 of middleburg va also is charged with failing to 
tell the internal revenue service about overseas financial 
accounts if convicted he faces up to 16 years in prison and fines 
of up to 1 million 
secord pleaded guilty last year to a felony count of making 
false statements to the irancontra congressional committees he 
was sentenced in january to two years probation 
secord said he asked clines in early 1985 to help obtain weapons 
for the rebels fighting the sandinista government in nicaragua 
secord said clines agreed he managed the procurement he 
said he used his contacts in the communist east bloc of europe 
and western part of europe to procure the infantry weapons that 
were needed 
clines often worked out of a closet office in lisbon 
portugal he said 
clines initially received 20 percent of the profits and began 
receiving 30 percent in 1986 secord said the remaining shares 
went to secord iranianborn businessman albert hakim and various 
companies the general testified 
prosecutors claim clines received about 882000 in commissions 
in the arms deals some of the money was kept in a swiss bank 
account codenamed c tea the prosecutors said 
clines reported gross earnings of 265000 for the tax year 1985 
and 402513 for 1986 according to a fourcount indictment 
returned feb 22 in baltimore 
secord said he couldnt remember much about the c tea account 
i have a vague recollection that he clines said there was 
such an account secord testified im not sure clines said 
anything to me about its purpose 
according to the congressional irancontra report issued in 
1987 the account was managed at a genevabased firm called 
compagnie de services fiduciare or csf 
secord said he believed the csf records were altered sometime 
after congress began investigating the irancontra affair 
i believe the csf ledgers were cooked secord said i 
believe they were falsified in some respects 
but when asked whether he had ever seen a forged document 
relating to clines profits secord said i dont believe so 
under questioning from defense attorney paula m junghans 
secord testified that clines was not a shareholder officer or 
director of any of the companies set up to channel irancontra arms 
money 
rafael chi chi quintero a former contract agent for the cia 
who began working for the irancontra operation in early 1985 
testified for the government under a grant of immunity 
quintero said clines once told him that he had earned roughly 
700000 during the affair he said he later overheard clines tell 
his lawyer on the telephone that he had earned 750000 
under crossexamination however quintero testified that he did 
not know if the figures referred to gross earnings or what clines 
had made after expenses or taxes 
in her opening remarks junghans said clines got involved in the 
affair because he was sympathetic to the contras and it was an 
opportunity to make some money 
there is no charge in this case that says its a crime to buy 
and sell arms she said

a judge on wednesday denied a 35 million 
wrongful death claim by the widow of sen john east who contended 
that government doctors failure to diagnose a thyroid disorder 
drove her husband to suicide 
the firstterm republican killed himself june 19 1986 by 
running his car in the closed garage of his greenville nc home 
he left a suicide note blaming his doctors saying they ruined 
my life 
priscilla east contended in her wrongful death lawsuit that 
navy doctors who provide care for members of congress were slow 
to detect her 55yearold husbands thyroid condition the suit 
said the delay triggered severe depression that led to the 
senators suicide 
us district judge walter black who heard the case without a 
jury ruled against mrs east 
this is a truly tragic case black wrote in his opinion 
however the court has determined that the medical care 
rendered by the government doctors while clearly not perfect does 
not establish liability in this case 
ira oring the assistant us attorney who represented the 
government said the physicians have had to live with a cloud 
over their careers for some period of time essentially they have 
been vindicated and were very happy for them 
terri steinhaus an attorney representing mrs east said the 
lawyers believe the courts decision is unsupported by the 
evidence 
ms steinhaus said mrs east had no comment on the decision she 
also said no decision has been reached on whether an appeal will be 
filed 
the case was heard in baltimore because that is the seat of the 
judicial district that includes bethesda naval medical center

his late fathers dream of a headquarters for 
the nations largest black church is the jewel in the crown in the 
reign of the rev tj jemison as president of the national baptist 
convention usa inc 
that must be our vatican that must be our center of 
strength jemison said as he cajoled pleaded for funds at the 
denominations 110th annual meeting for the 10 million world 
baptist center some critics say is a monument to one mans ego 
the center with its 162foot spire 3000seat auditorium and 
300seat choir loft was dedicated with great fanfare in june 1989 
in nashville tenn with the rev jesse jackson at his side 
jemison said he was the instrument called by god to build the 
headquarters envisioned by his father dv jemison 
for others it revives the ageold controversy of whether church 
money should be spent on buildings or people 
it is a travesty when we see the problems of drug abuse 
teenage parenting and other social ills said cain felder 
professor of new testament at howard divinity school at howard 
university and the author of troubling biblical waters race 
class and family 
even critics concede the headquarters the first one of its 
kind ever for a black church body is a tribute to the remarkable 
charismatic powers of jemison 
his father elected president of the baptist convention in 1941 
was not able to realize his dream of giving the denomination an 
architectural monument of its own blind and in failing health the 
rev dv jemison was forced out of office by the rev joseph h 
jackson in 1953 but not before he ensured his son was installed as 
general secretary of the denomination 
tj jemison had to wait 29 years before jackson would be ousted 
from office but he almost immediately set out to build a 
headquarters that would rival the buildings long taken for granted 
by most predominantly white denominations 
in so doing he may have permanently altered the way the 
denominations 32000 churches give financial support to the 78 
millionmember baptist convention which refers to itself as the 
largest black organization in the world 
jemison has made it clear annual contributions as low as 50 
would no longer be acceptable and has tried to recruit 100000 
baptist builders to give at least 10 a month to pay off the 7 
million still owed on the building 
on tuesday jemison devoted half of the denominations board of 
directors meeting to taking up a collection for the center raising 
half of the 1 million fundraising goal he set for the annual 
meeting 
jemison continued fundraising at the general convention 
wednesday 
dont walk around with the money in your pocket jemison 
told the delegates dont get too happy and keep it to friday 
felder said the center with its palatial offices and 
prominently displayed portraits of jemison is a symbol of how the 
denomination has not fulfilled its potential for social change as 
the nations largest black institution 
it is a sleeping giant that tends to remain asleep when it 
tends to wake up it is filled with gross overindulgence felder 
said 
forrest harris director of the kelly miller smith institute on 
the black church at vanderbilt divinity school said jemison has a 
clear agenda for addressing social problems but he said the jury 
is still out on jemisons administration because so much energy 
has been invested in the building of the world baptist center 
even while raising funds jemison concedes he has his 
detractors but he contends the center will be a catalyst for 
social action including being a place where the homeless drug 
abusers and people afflicted with aids will be cared for 
the headquarters is a symbol of new independence for national 
baptists jemison said 
its not for jemison its not my ploy he said tuesday as a 
steady stream of delegates brought up checks from their 
congregations its something we should have had a long time 
ago

murderer who contends his confession was coerced by a sheriff who 
is now a congressman 
barry lee fairchild 36 had been scheduled to die wednesday 
night by injection but the 8th us circuit court of appeals voted 
30 tuesday to send the case to us district court for a hearing 
on the allegations he was beaten by the sheriff and his deputies 
that hearing was scheduled for nov 13 
us rep tommy robinson has denied that as sheriff he and his 
pulaski county deputies beat fairchild and five other black 
suspects and urged them to confess to the 1983 abduction rape and 
murder of air force nurse marjorie greta mason 
on wednesday he released a statement criticizing the justice 
system and the defense these legal maneuvers could go on for 
years the time has come for congress to limit the number of 
appeals that can be filed by those on death rows across the 
country 
the rights of barry lee fairchild were never violated the 
statement continued he abducted raped and murdered a young lady 
who had been in our state for only 10 days he has had appeal after 
appeal at some point all of us must step back and say enough 
the congressman was elected as a democrat but switched to the 
republican party he lost the gop primary for governor this year 
and isnt seeking reelection to the house 
the high court ruling to uphold the stay of execution was 
unanimous said supreme court press officer toni house 
fairchilds attorneys say he is mildly retarded with an iq 
between the 60s and 80s and contend he was easy prey for 
authorities seeking to force a confession he confessed twice but 
later said the statements were coerced 
his lawyers also contend that someone else confessed to the 
murder and that police dropped the man as a suspect because he 
provided few details about the crime 
defense attorneys say they have interviewed four men who say 
they too were beaten and threatened with racial epithets by 
deputies investigating the case 
on wednesday assistant attorney general jack gillean confirmed 
that three of the four men who submitted affidavits about the 
alleged beatings were suspects in the murder he said they were 
questioned by police days before fairchild was arrested and 
questioned 
defense attorney john wesley hall said the fact that police had 
other suspects wasnt revealed to his clients trial counsel the 
information could have helped convince the jury that police 
rounded up blacks and beat on them until they elected which one was 
the best one to be charged hall said 
gillean said he had no reason to believe the information was 
withheld

iraqi president saddam hussein on 
wednesday renewed his call for a holy war against the huge western 
military presence and said un sanctions could kill iraqi 
children 
he also urged arabs to rise up and overthrow leaders aligned 
against him singling out saudi arabias king fahd and president 
hosni mubarak of egypt formerly close allies 
saddam has previously called for a holy war or jihad but his 
speech read by a spokesman over baghdad television wednesday was 
his most virulent attack on arab leaders who sided with western 
powers after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
an earlier translation from saddams arabic speech carried by 
the associated press incorrectly stated that saddam said some 
children were dying because of the sanctions 
the children of iraq are dying that translation said 
however the arabic text carried by the official iraqi news 
agency did not contain that quote 
in the broadcast speech monitored in cyprus saddam appeared to 
reject foreign help to circumvent the un embargo assistance for 
which his government had previously appealed on humanitarian 
grounds 
have you o brothers known throughout the history that you 
have come across that anyone tried to starve a nation to death by 
depriving it of food said saddam 
and have you witnessed in the history that is known to you 
that some children should die because of a premeditated decision to 
deprive them of milk 
the children of iraq before the rest of the nation refuse 
that we beg for the milk which they need from the infidels and 
shameless 
saddam reiterated that iraq would defy the boycott and would be 
victorious even against the advanced military technology arrayed 
against it 
he said the people are ready to sacrifice and do without 
saddam is holding an estimated 20000 westerners and has 
deployed some western men as human shields to deter attack on vital 
military and civilian installations within iraq 
he has warned that any shortages among iraqs civilian 
population caused by the unimposed embargo would be applied 
equally to foreign children and elderly persons being detained 
in the past saddam has bragged that his nation could withstand 
the sanctions a claim made in tandem with iraqi attempts to 
convince some embargo nations to wink at the sanctions and resume 
trade with iraq 
jordan a close ally of iraq has agreed to go along with 
sanctions but has so far rejected fullscale compliance on the 
grounds that international law might forbid blocking food and 
medicine from iraq 
referring to the egyptian and saudi people saddam said we 
call on them to revolt against the traitors and fight the 
presence in the holy land of the western multinational force 
we call upon all arabs within the teachings of allah and 
according to the moslem holy war of jihad to fight this us 
presence of nonbelievers and to fight the stance taken by arab 
agents who have followed these foreigners said saddam in the 
broadcast 
the western force in the gulf now totals about 65000 troops and 
30 to 40 warships 
arab nations such as egypt morrocco and syria have sent 
contingents to fight in the usled multinational force while the 
fivenation gulf cooperation council has fielded its rapid 
deployment force against him 
the gcc members include the united arab emirates oman qatar 
saudi arabia bahrain and before the invasion kuwait 
saddams speech on baghdad television was read by miqdad morad 
a veteran radio and television announcer who was the only spokesman 
authorized to announce military communiques during the eightyear 
iraniraq war 
saddam charged the saudis were agents of foreign forces who were 
backed by the zionist money and the zionist media a 
reference to domestic us support for israel

a military court sentenced four palestinians to 
life in prison for murdering an arab village leader the army said 
wednesday the 1000th day of the uprising against israeli rule of 
the occupied lands 
arab reporters said the men all from the west bank village of 
kfar bidiya killed the village leader on suspicion he sold land to 
israelis 
underground leaders of the uprising had called for protest 
marches to mark the anniversary of the israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip but no demonstrations were reported 
instead thousands of palestinian children marched off to the 
first day of elementary school classes in the west bank one 
stonethrowing incident was reported in a schoolyard 
the army said the four men sentenced on tuesday were hassan 
idalkum ahmed salah salah abusafia and hasan elkara they were 
convicted of gunning down mustafa salim abu bakr 41 the muhktar 
or traditional leader of kfar bidiya in october 1988 the army 
said 
the gunmen set abu bakrs body afire after killing him the 
muhktars two young sons were wounded in the incident 
about 255 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs in the 
33monthold uprising most on suspicion of collaboration with 
israeli authorities 
in addition 728 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians and 47 israelis have died in the violence 
repeated orders from the palestine liberation organization 
urging moderation in collaborator interrogations have not reduced 
the collaborator killings 
meanwhile the israeli military government allowed 195000 
elementary students in the west bank to begin their 199091 school 
year 
intermediate and senior high schools will be allowed to open in 
the next several weeks if there are no problems at elementary 
schools the government said about 100000 students attend these 
schools 
gaza schools opened tuesday and no incidents were reported 
according to israeli radio reports 
most elementary and secondary schools in the west bank were 
closed for at least six months during the 198889 school year after 
the army charged they were hotbeds of antiisraeli activity 
human rights groups and palestinian educators said the closures 
constituted collective punishment 
israeli authorities warned that schools would be closed again if 
violence breaks out 
we are assuming that parents teachers and students will be 
aware of the fact that we will not agree to suffer violence or 
incitement from within the schools said brig gen freddie zach 
deputy coordinator for the territories we hope that they will 
try to do all they can in order to keep violence out of the 
schools

thousands of monrovia residents seeking 
food and safety flocked wednesday to areas of the capital under the 
control of a west african military force 
monrovia has been virtually cut off from the outside world for 
more than two months partly because of heavy street fighting 
between troops loyal to president samuel doe and two rival rebel 
factions 
maj chris otulana a spokesman for the fivenation west african 
force said wednesday that everywhere in monrovia is calm at the 
moment 
he said some rebels loyal to charles taylor were cooperating in 
efforts to restore peace to the capital 
but taylor who has vowed to destroy the task force continued 
broadcasts from a captured government radio transmitter they 
accused the west african soldiers of abuses ranging from murdering 
civilians to selling cocaine to children 
both doe and prince johnson the leader of a splinter rebel 
group have welcomed the west african troops their forces appeared 
to be observing a truce that began aug 24 the day the west 
africans landed 
the west africans were sent to liberia under orders to end the 
civil war which has left at least 5000 people mostly civilians 
dead since december 
taylor contends that the west african intervention is just a 
ploy to keep doe in power he has expressed concern that the force 
includes soldiers from nigeria and guinea whose leaders in the 
past supported doe 
thousands of monrovia residents poured into areas of the capital 
controlled by the 3000 troops from those nations and ghana sierra 
leone and gambia they apparently felt safer there than in the 
areas held by doe or johnson 
the influx was especially heavy at night in the areas 
controlled by the west africans there was more commerce than at 
any time since the fighting hit the capital with food the most 
highly sought after item 
the west africans control the port area but efforts to use 
spriggs payne airfield to bring in supplies has been hampered by 
the threat of mortar fire from taylors troops the airport is 
controlled by does forces but taylors rebels have staged 
occasional attacks 
diplomats said that if the african force can open the airport 
it will deny taylor any hold on the city and also restore an air 
link with the outside world 
once in firm control of the capital the west africans could 
then move to restore electricity and water and bring in 
desperately needed food and medicine 
when the task force arrived monrovia had been isolated and 
without water and electricity for two months there was almost no 
food 
the task force was not expected to make any major push against 
taylors forces until its commander lt gen arnold quainoo of 
ghana returns from consultations with west african leaders later 
this week 
taylors rebels invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 branding 
does government as corrupt and saying they would overthrow it a 
rebel faction led by johnson broke with taylor in february 
taylor since has declared himself president of liberia his 
forces hold most of the country outside monrovia but their advance 
in the capitals eastern suburbs was held up by does troops doe 
remains holed up in his fortified seaside mansion and johnsons 
rebel group controls part of the capital

nasa scrubbed the launch of space 
shuttle columbia for the third time after discovering a leak as 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being poured into the fuel 
tank on wednesday 
the decision was made after 10 times the normal amount of 
hydrogen was found in the shuttles aft compartment said shuttle 
director robert crippen 
the launch crew immediately began trying to trace the leak no 
new launch date was set 
nasa canceled the first launch attempt in may after sensors 
detected an unusual buildup of liquid hydrogen during fueling in 
the aft compartment and around a valve in plumbing between the 
orbiter and external tank the second scrub was last week because 
mission control had trouble communicating with one of the four 
telescopes in columbias cargo bay 
i think we got fooled by the fact we had two leaks crippen 
said i think this leak has been there all along 
crippen said there was no leak this time in the connecting link 
between shuttle and tank the aft compartment where the explosive 
hydrogen was found contains the shuttles main engines 
thursdays attempt would have been the 36th shuttle flight and 
the first in four months 
wednesdays troubles were the latest blow to nasas image the 
highly touted hubble space telescope failed to operate as 
advertised because its mirrors were ground wrong the shuttle 
atlantis developed a hydrogen leak similar to columbias and nasa 
controllers had intermittent problems contacting the magellan space 
probe which is orbiting venus 
the shuttles business is flying and were sitting on the 
ground crippen said i guess all i can say is that the shuttle 
is a very complicated vehicle it flies in environments that are 
very strenuous and we have to be able to assure that the vehicle is 
safe to fly 
in the three months since the first leak was discovered nasa 
has tested and retested the lines between the fuel tank and its 
three shuttles but never with a tankload of fuel 
crippen said he didnt regret his decision against a tanking 
test such a test would have required five or six days 
it wouldnt have given me that much lead time crippen said 
the line being used on columbia is new having been taken from 
the orbiter endeavour which is under construction in california 
the leak wednesday wasnt in the area of that line nasa said 
but the space agency offered no clue where else it might be 
space shuttles rely on two sources of power to get into orbit 
two solid fuel rockets burn for two minutes to get the vehicle off 
the ground at the same time and continuing for eight minutes 
the orbiter engines burn a combination of liquid oxygen and liquid 
hydrogen 
the shuttles 154footlong tank holds 385000 gallons of liquid 
hydrogen which is cooled to 423 degrees fahrenheit below zero and 
144000 gallons of liquid oxygen at 297 degrees below zero 
the leak was revealed as the hydrogen was pumped in at the rate 
of 8400 gallons a minute in the socalled fastfill mode it 
didnt show in the early minutes of fueling when the hydrogen was 
loaded at the rate of 1000 gallons a minute 
columbia was to have carried an array of four telescopes into 
orbit four astronomers in the crew of seven would have operated 
the instruments which would remain in the shuttles cargo bay the 
launch with the 150 million astro observatory aboard had been 
scheduled for 120 am edt 
dozens of us are dying to see this thing get launched said 
arthur davidsen principal investigator of one of astros four 
telescopes 
it was only the fifth time nasa scheduled a shuttle launch at 
night and the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely 
to scientific research the night launch was planned because of the 
demands of the astronomy mission speaking to nasa employees via 
closedcircuit television from the johnson space center in houston 
vice president dan quayle called the mission cuttingedge space 
activity 
he said that despite its recent problems nasa is up to doing 
the job it was assigned to do 
take it from a guy who knows a lot about unwarranted 
criticism he said once they pile it on they just dont know 
when to stop 
standing about 1 miles away was discovery which was moved to 
nasas other shuttle launch pad tuesday night to await an october 
flight with the ulysses satellite that will study the sun 
the astro designed to study highly energetic stars galaxies 
and other hot objects has been waiting for a shuttle ride since 
march 1986 nasas original target date for the mission the flight 
was postponed indefinitely because of the challenger disaster 
earlier that year

an iraqi soldier shot an american citizen 
trying to avoid capture in kuwait according to a reported reaching 
the state department revealed by the department wednesday night 
the reported shooting happened during a day in which president 
bush telephoned the besieged us embassy in kuwait to encourage 
the ambassador and his skeleton staff to hang on under most 
difficult circumstances 
separately bush told lawmakers he would consider further moves 
if economic pressure fails to push iraqi forces from kuwait 
the state department said attempts by us diplomats to obtain 
more information from iraqi officials in kuwait have been in vain 
we will continue to press this case 
the department declined to identify the american and said it did 
not know the seriousness of his injuries 
bush who met privately with more than 30 senators and house 
members will address a public joint session of congress next 
tuesday night after returning from his weekend summit meeting with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
senior administration aides meanwhile disclosed that the 
united states wants its allies to pay the entire cost either in 
cash or contributions of material of the us military buildup in 
the persian gulf the aides said the administration estimated those 
costs as 6 billion to the end of the year and 1 billion a month 
after that plus 105 billion a year for nearby states hurt by the 
trade embargo and an unspecified sum for developing countries 
battered by oil price increases 
at the capitol on wednesday secretary of state james a baker 
iii wound up a second day of congressional questioning repeating 
his proposal for planning of a new regional security structure 
for the middle east and was leaving wednesday night for saudi 
arabia 
he said anew that americans should not expect any quick 
resolution of the standoff which has brought tens of thousands of 
us troops to the saudi desert across the kuwaiti border from an 
even larger force of iraqis 
current us efforts aimed at weakening saddams resolve 
through the economic embargo are going to take some time and 
that is what we ask most of the american people stand firm be 
patient and remain united so that together we can show that 
aggression does not pay baker told the senate foreign relations 
committee 
however the current situation plays out he said this is not 
the last crisis of this nature we are likely to face in this 
region it is worthwhile to begin considering regional security 
structures that would guarantee an equilibrium in this region 
that will produce peace and create a more durable order he 
gave no details and said such planning was in a very early stage 
meanwhile prince bandar bin sultan the saudi ambassador to the 
united states sent letters to each member of congress expressing 
his countrys gratitude for lawmakers support of operation desert 
shield 
i want to convey our regard and respect for the individual men 
and women of the american air naval and ground units now 
temporarily in saudi arabia and the adjoining waters side by side 
with our own defense forces and those from a number of important 
arab european and other countries vigilantly there he said 
in one military development the navy said it had authorized the 
battleship uss wisconsin in the persian gulf to fire its 16inch 
guns which had been silenced in may after an investigation was 
reopened into the deadly explosion aboard the wisconsins sister 
ship the uss iowa 
navy spokesman cmdr jim mitchell said additional tests had 
determined that the 16inch guns may safely fire specified lots 
of powder which are now loaded on the wisconsin 
bakers overseas trip which will also include the weekend 
ussoviet summit in helsinki and later stops in europe will be 
partly focused on soliciting major contributions to help pay for 
the mideast effort opposing saddam another cabinet member 
treasury secretary nicholas brady was on his way to south korea 
wednesday after winning a pledge of support from margaret thatcher 
in london 
at the white house fitzwater said bush called the embassy in 
kuwait city to express his appreciation to ambassador nathaniel 
howell and the few other staff members who stayed behind to assist 
americans trapped in the region 
iraq has cut off water and electricity to the embassy as part of 
its effort to shut down all foreign embassies in the land they 
annexed following an aug 2 lightning invasion 
bush told his envoy to keep up the good work under these most 
difficult circumstances fitzwater said 
ambassador howell is struggling with a very difficult 
situation in terms of the physical conditions there they have 
fastdiminishing supplies of water and electricity but as you all 
know and have seen on the television reports the embassy staff 
there has been actively working with us citizens in helping to 
facilitate these flights out of kuwait and out of iraq the 
spokesman said 
later on wednesday bush met with more 30 members of congress 
concerning the persian gulf crisis 
bush told them that we must keep pressure on iraq and convince 
saddam hussein that time is against him fitzwater said the 
president said the sanctions must succeed if not we will review 
our options 
the spokesman would not elaborate 
the lawmakers gave bush repeated statements of support to see 
this mission through fitzwater said 
they also had suggestions they indicated in comments after the 
meeting in some of them 
sen john glenn dohio said the us troops stationed in the 
saudi arabian desert might be given pay and income tax incentives 
to forestall a morale problem glenn part of a congressional 
delegation just back from the middle east said he also suggested 
such benefits as free stamps 
glenn suggested sanctions against countries letting planes 
depart for iraq 
sen william cohen rmaine said bush should push soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev during this weekends summit meeting 
to pull remaining soviet military and technical advisers out of 
iraq 
sen john kerry dmass said he urged bush to press the 
soviets for intelligence on the iraqi military capability 
fitzwater praised the soviet unions role in the international 
effort to isolate iraq 
during the day the white house brushed off iraqi president 
saddam husseins incorrectly reported statement that the children 
of iraq are dying because of the unsupported economic embargo 
dismising it as a rhetorical diatribe the statement later was 
determined to be an incorrect translation from the arabic

leftist guerrillas bombed the countrys 
main oil pipeline wednesday forcing the staterun oil company 
ecopetrol to suspend pumping 
ecopetrol said it has stopped pumping 235000 barrels of crude 
oil a day almost half its daily output 
guerrillas of the national liberation army known as the eln 
blew up a section of the cano limon oil pipeline in northeastern

the company did not give any details 
the 500milelong pipeline transports most of the countrys 
petroleum destined for export 
the procuban national liberation army has bombed the pipeline 
scores of times since 1986 causing losses estimated at 520 
million 
the guerrilla group is seeking to reduce the presence of foreign 
oil companies in colombia it is the only leftist rebel group that 
has refused to join peace talks with the government 
colombia is currently producing at maximum capacity around 
465000 barrels a day around 200000 barrels a day are earmarked 
for the international market where prices have risen sharply 
because of the persian gulf crisis 
last month president cesar gaviria announced that colombia was 
raising its oil production by about 15000 barrels per day to join 
other oil producers in helping make up for the shortfall resulting 
from the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
un economic sanctions have caused the withdrawal of more than 
4 million barrels a day of iraqi and kuwaiti oil from the world 
market saudi arabia the united arab emirates and venezuela have 
boosted production to cover most of the shortfall

george plimpton joyce carol oates and 
susan sontag are among the literary chorus pleading with the 
president of yale university to save the prestigious yale review 
the literary quarterly which introduced the works of eudora 
welty robert frost robert penn warren virginia woolf eugene 
oneill among others is to be shelved after issuing its 79th 
volume in november 
more than 50 novelists critics professors and poets have 
signed a petition opposing the decision to halt publication of the 
magazine the oldest literary quarterly in the country 
the petition was delivered tuesday to yale president benno c 
schmidt jr 
schmidt announced in june that yale would shelve the quarterly 
after its 79th volume citing financial difficulty limited 
readership and the absence of any direct tie to yales academic 
programs 
annie dillard author of pilgrim at tinker creek plimpton 
editor of the paris review charles mcgrath deputy editor of the 
new yorker magazine robert giroux editor of farrar straus and 
giroux publishers in new york and james laughlin the founding 
editor of new directions a literary magazine were among those to 
sign the petition 
other signatories from the literary world included novelist iris 
murdoch author oates poet adrienne rich critic sontag pulitzer 
prizewinning poets william meredith and richard wilbur and lord 
noel annan former provost of kings college at cambridge university 
and the university of london 
schmidt said a list of names would not taken alone make a 
difference in his decision though they are serious people and 
ought to be paid attention to 
the yale review has a paid circulation of only about 4200 
schmidt said he wasnt confident he could raise the 1 million 
or so needed for an endowment to fund the the magazines annual 
cost of 60000 to 80000 at a time the university faces other 
financial pressures 
several potential donors have expressed interest in helping fund 
various sorts of publications he said some along the lines of 
the yale review and some not however he said there is no 
clear sense as yet whether they will ripen into actual 
commitments

a toxic plume from a fire that gutted a 
chemicalfilled warehouse near the prudhoe bay oil field prompted 
the evacuation of more than 1000 workers state officials said 
but there were no reports wednesday of injuries nor that 
chemicals had spilled onto the tundra the delicate arctic layer of 
plants that can take years to regenerate 
the fire at the dowell schlumberger inc warehouse at an 
oilfield service camp in deadhorse was contained within four hours 
tuesday night said louis steinke alaska manager for dowell 
schlumberger 
brad fristoe north slope district manager for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation said the nature of the 
fire made it difficult to fight and the building essentially was 
left to burn 
fristoe said the dec would investigate whether chemicals spilled 
on the tundra steinke said there was no evidence of a spill 
fristoe said at least 1000 oilfield workers were evacuated 
but steinke said there were wide fluctuations in estimates and he 
did not have a figure workers returned wednesday morning 
the plume was caused by a number of the chemicals they had 
within the building fristoe said the warehouse contents 
included lubricants acid and solvent he said steinke said a list 
of the buildings inventory was being drawn up 
the fire did not interrupt the flow of oil from prudhoe bay

lt gov evelyn murphy said wednesday shes 
waiting for gov michael dukakis to leave on a trade mission to 
europe so that as acting governor she can push her own plan for 
curing the states fiscal troubles 
dukakis who has postponed the trip angrily replied that murphy 
was playing politics in her lagging bid to win the democratic 
gubernatorial nomination 
earlier murphy said ill put my proposals on the table if he 
continues on his trip 
when im in charge ill show you how i make some decisions 
she said 
the governors in charge murphy added when he wants my 
opinion he can ask for it 
she did not make any details of her fiscal plan public 
this is alexandra haig with nixons secret plan said 
dukakis spokesman stephen crawford he referred to thensecretary 
of state alexander haig who said he was in charge of the white 
house when president reagan was wounded in an assassination 
attempt and richard nixon who said during the 1968 presidential 
election that he had a plan to end the vietnam war but never made 
it public 
a dukakis administration source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said murphy refused to provide the governor with details 
of her proposal when he asked her during a telephone conversation 
wednesday afternoon 
dukakis said of that conversation what i heard was a 
candidate who was trying to use this states fiscal situation for 
personal political gain 
murphy made her comments while looking to inject life into her 
campaign for governor murphy has been trailing her two democratic 
opponents francis x bellotti and john silber who have tried to 
link her with the states fiscal collapse under the dukakis 
administration 
lieutenant governors are elected independently in massachusetts 
so murphy isnt part of the dukakis administration though both are 
democrats 
she has said in the past that she disagreed with the states 
spending practices but her statements wednesday marked one of her 
sharpest departures from dukakis who has low popularity and is not 
seeking reelection 
massachusetts had one of the strongest economies of any state in 
the late 1980s and dukakis touted the massachusetts miracle 
while he campaigned for president in 1988 but when he returned to 
the state after losing to george bush the economy began a slide 
that still is worsening 
dukakis had been scheduled to leave on a european trade mission 
earlier this week but he postponed his travel plans after learning 
that state tax collections fell below projections for the second 
straight month aides said wednesday he hadnt decided when to 
leave 
on tuesday dukakis ordered cabinet secretaries to devise plans 
to cut 150 million from the 134 billion budget for fiscal 1991 
the legislature earlier this year ordered 265 million in cuts and 
approved the biggest tax increase in state history 
murphy said dukakis wasnt acting fast enough 
he hasnt cut yet she said he asked for plans there has 
to be a sense of urgency 
robert donahue campaign director for silber said murphy had 
the opportunity when the state was in a mess when the governor was 
campaigning for president in 1988 she ignored it then

south korea on thursday proposed that 
the two koreas officially recognize each others governments but 
the communist north was not likely to accept 
south korean prime minister kang younghoon initially made the 
offer wednesday at the first talks ever between prime ministers of 
the hostile nations but the proposal was not acted upon 
their final closeddoor session started thursday morning with 
the seven official delegates of both sides sitting across from one 
another at a conference table in a hotel ballroom 
north korea has steadfastly refused to recognize the legitimacy 
of the seoul government maintaining that such a policy would 
perpetuate the division of the peninsula split in 1945 
south korea believes mutual recognition would be practical and 
allow both nations to coexit until unification of the peninsula 
could be achieved 
moreover the south says the north has given tacit recognition 
by agreeing to hold the historic talks the highestlevel contact 
ever held between the nations 
south korean spokesman kim hyungki told a briefing that mutual 
recognition is necessary to ease mutual distrust and improve 
relations between the counties 
he also said 10 north koreans including prime minister yon 
hyong muk would visit south korean president roh taewoo later 
thursday at the presidential mansion 
that meeting would mark the first time the leader of south korea 
has received an official representative of the rival communist 
north korean government since separate governments were formed in 
1948 
during wednesdays meeting about 1000 radical students marched 
through seoul shouting antius antigovernment slogans and 
hurling rocks and firebombs at riot police 
no prime ministers talks without release of unification 
prisoners shouted the students at seoul national university 
us troops get out riot police fired tear gas to block the 
students from marching off campus several students and police were 
injured and at least five students were arrested 
in addition eight radicals were arrested for staging illegal 
demonstrations in front of the hotel where the prime ministers were 
meeting a north korean television cameraman trying to film the 
scene was roughed up by riot police trying to stop him he was not 
injured 
the radical students a small but vocal minority in south korea 
oppose the presence of the 43000 us troops in their country 
saying it hinders chances for unification of north and south korea 
the americans are here under a mutual defense pact with south korea 
during wednesdays meeting north korea demanded that south 
korea release jailed dissidents and stop joint military exercises 
with the united states the north also demanded that south korea 
stop efforts to enter the united nations separately saying that to 
do so would perpetuate national division 
the north korean leader accused south korea of trying to seek a 
twokorea policy through the talks 
if your side takes a twokorea road our dialogue would be 
meaningless and lose its significance the norths premier said 
you must stop efforts to maintain status quo 
south korean officials indicated they would reject all three 
demands at thursdays closeddoor session 
the prime ministers met tuesday and opened formal talks 
wednesday the north koreans are to return home friday if all goes 
well they will meet again next month in the north korean capital 
virtually all the demands and proposals issued by both sides 
wednesday have been made before but never face to face by 
representatives of the rival governments

a federal judge on wednesday rejected an attempt 
to block an execution by a drugdispensing machine that prisoners 
lawyers contend could inflict cruel and unusual punishment 
us district judge james zagel denied an injunction to block 
the sept 12 execution of charles walker who could become the 
first person executed in illinois in 28 years 
zagel said the convicted murderer shouldnt become a pawn in 
a fight over the states death penalty statute 
lawyers working on behalf of condemned prisoners had filed a 
lawsuit in federal court seeking classaction status for the nearly 
130 illinois inmates on death row 
the lawsuit contended the state would violate its own death 
penalty law by executing the inmates with a machine that delivers a 
lethal combination of three drugs state law specifically states 
that two drugs are to be used 
the judge continued the hearing on the lethalinjection issue 
for eight weeks which would be after walkers execution date 
the lawsuit recalls the controversy in florida over whether its 
electric chair was a valid means of execution or a torture device 
during a may 4 execution of jesse joseph tafero flames and 
sparks shot from the inmates head and smoke filled floridas 
execution chamber tafero was finally declared dead after three 
jolts of electricity 
attorneys for three condemned inmates won indefinite stays from 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta with arguments 
the electric chair was not functioning properly their status was 
unclear after a successful execution in the same electric chair in 
july 
the lawyers in illinois requested an immediate injunction 
blocking all state executions until their dispute was settled 
there hasnt been an execution in illinois since 1962 
stuart altschuler a lawyer for the plaintiffs said the lawsuit 
was filed because the states lethal injection machine execution 
procedures and personnel are suspect under state law 
the law amended in 1983 to provide for execution by lethal 
injection rather than electrocution specifies that two chemicals 
be used an ultrashort acting barbiturate to sedated the 
condemned person and a drug that causes paralysis 
but the machine injects three chemicals into the body sodium 
pentathol a barbiturate to render prisoner unconscious 
pancuronium bromide which paralyzes the prisoner and potassium 
chloride which stops the prisoners heart 
it is the potassium chloride that lawyers find objectionable 
they say it is an electrolyte that could cause an excruciating 
burning sensation in the prisoners vein and since he would be 
paralyzed by the second drug he would be unable tell anyone 
an inmate put to death on the machine could vomit and suffocate 
which constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of 
plaintiffs rights under the eighth amendment the lawsuit 
contends 
we have not asked the judge in any way to invalidate the death 
penalty he said weve merely asked that the state adhere to 
its own laws 
altschuler said he planned to file an immediate appeal 
terry madsen chief of the illinois attorney generals criminal 
appeals division said the state continues to test its lethal 
injection machine many other states have used it properly he 
added 
madsen said he was confident the machine would not inflict any 
pain upon walker or others 
but fred leuchter jr the boston man who invented the 25000 
machine that illinois will use said last month he tested the 
machine in may and found it failed 70 percent of the time 
leuchter said the machine is very likely to fail during 
walkers execution because the machinery had been sitting in a damp 
place since it was bought in 1987 
state prison officials however said leuchter made the comments 
out of spite after they dropped him as a consultant to the 
execution 
zagel also denied the lawsuit classaction status saying such a 
method should be used only in cases where the plaintiffs arent 
readily identifiable 
he scheduled a hearing for oct 31 to examine how the states 
lethal injection machine functions and for a briefing on the 
remaining plaintiffs convicted killers charles silagy and walter 
stewart both are on death row 
zagel said he felt no need to act quickly since no execution 
date has been set for either man and since he ordered walker 
excluded from the lawsuit 
in denying the petition to block walkers execution the judge 
noted that walker has repeatedly indicated he wants to die to pay 
his debt to society for the 1983 slayings of a man and a woman in 
southern illinois

a man admitted to police he pulled a 
plastic bag over his wifes head as she lost consciousness while 
trying to commit suicide in a motel room a recording played in 
court wednesday disclosed 
the audio recording was played during a preliminary hearing that 
will decide whether sufficient evidence exists to try bertram 
harper on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the 
aug 19 death of virginia harper 
in the recorded statement given to a romulus police detective 
about nine hours after mrs harper died harper described his 
wifes cancer and their earlier commitment to end each others 
suffering if necessary 
the loomis calif couple chose to do that in michigan harper 
said because they understood the state has no law against helping 
someone commit suicide 
but harpers lawyer said later the couple was not influenced by 
the case of dr jack kevorkian who helped an oregon woman commit 
suicide june 4 that case has garnered publicity worldwide 
a deputy wayne county coroner sawait kanluen testified that 
mrs harper 69 had liver cancer but neither that nor drugs she 
had taken in the suicide attempt killed her she had taken 
nontoxic amounts of the painkiller darvon the sleeping pill 
dalmane and the motionsickness drug dramamine 
kanluen said harper died of asphyxiation 
harper admitted to police that as his wife slipped into 
unconsciousness he placed a clear plastic bag over her head and 
secured it with rubber bands knotted together 
if i hadnt placed the bag i dont know what would have 
happened harper told detective sgt gordon malaniak 
eventually she probably would perhaps come out of the 
sleeping pills but then shed have been back to square one shed 
have been back in pain 
i was doing what to the best of my knowledge and belief is 
exactly what my wife wanted and intended me and counted me on 
doing 
district judge henry zaborowski adjourned the hearing until 
friday morning 
after wednesdays hearing harper held a news conference with 
his stepdaughter shanda mcgrew defense attorney hugh davis and 
derek humphry executive director of the hemlock society an 
organization advocating the right of terminally ill people to end 
their lives when and as they choose the society is financing 
harpers defense 
davis said the murder charge will not stand up because it lacks 
the key element of malice 
the definition of malice cant be construed broadly enough 
to include love he said 
davis also denied that the harpers came to michigan to carry out 
their death pact because no charges have been brought against 
kevorkian who invented a machine that alzheimers disease sufferer 
janet adkins of portland ore used to kill herself prosecutors 
are still investigating that case 
harper said he and his wife learned from a book by humphry that 
michigan has no law against helping someone commit suicide 
i think theyve been made sacrificial lambs on the altar of 
the dilemma about what to do about dr kevorkian humphry said 
harper was jailed for a week before a bail bondsman he never met 
posted his 25000 bond no charges have been filed against ms 
mcgrew

the massachusetts economy faltering since gov 
michael s dukakis ran for president in 1988 is sinking ever 
deeper 
the legislature this year already approved the biggest tax 
increase in massachusetts history and ordered 265 million in 
budget cuts 
on tuesday dukakis ordered 150 million more trimmed from state 
spending and warned it may not be the last time he has to make 
such a request 
dukakis also put off his participation in a trade mission to 
europe to deal with the latest bad news on the fiscal front 
lagging tax collections 
nearly half of massachusetts residents meanwhile would 
consider moving out of the state if the economy got any worse a 
poll indicated 
propelled by a hightech boom massachusetts economy was among 
the fastestgrowing in the nation by the late 1980s in his white 
house bid dukakis touted the massachusetts miracle and its 
nine straight balanced budgets 
but when he returned to the state after losing to george bush 
the picture had begun changing that year lawmakers approved small 
tax and fee increases to balance the budget 
last year legislators approved a 15 percent income tax increase 
that was supposed to be temporary 
and this year the legislature approved 12 billion in higher 
taxes this year and 16 billion the next fiscal year and cut 
spending by 4 percent across the board 
and still the 134 billion budget was in the red 
this week the revenue department reported that getting it back 
into the black would be even more difficult august tax collections 
had come in 267 million below estimates and collections for july 
were almost as poor 
dukakis then ordered his cabinet secretaries to make cuts 
amounting to about 4 percent of executive branch spending 
i hope this will be the last time i have to ask my cabinet 
secretaries to make these reductions but given the uncertainty it 
may not be he said 
the governor said the cuts are absolutely essential if were 
going to make sure that this state begins to get back on the road 
to economic recovery 
asked about the possibility of another tax increase dukakis 
said i dont think thats at all realistic 
the governors action was endorsed by richard manley head of 
the businessbacked massachusetts taxpayers foundation and by 
democratic legislative leaders 
republican leaders while acknowledging the need for cuts said 
the move was too little too late 
it is my understanding the governor has canceled his trip to 
europe on the theory he recognizes the fiscal crisis he might do 
well to take his european trip and cancel the return flight said 
senate minority leader david locke

mercedes maximiliana stirs a huge steaming 
pot and wonders how many neighbors its contents will feed many 
will go hungry she knows 
the pot boils over onto a sputtering kerosene stove that is the 
prize possession of the cocina popular mrs maximilianas soup 
kitchen in los rosales a hillside shantytown 
dozens of thin ragged children wait anxiously around the 
thatchroofed hut in the chill mist of a winter day 
they at least have a chance of eating food prices have 
quadrupled in recent weeks and millions of peruvians go to bed 
hungry every night 
mrs maximilianas soup kitchen called los revolucionarios the 
revolutionaries is one of about 3000 in lima organized by rural 
migrants who join together to save money on cooking 
sixty mothers formed los revolucionarios five years ago and it 
feeds nearly 400 people each day 
more keep coming mrs maximiliana said and we have to 
turn them away because we have no more food 
roman catholic church officials say the soup kitchens serve an 
average of 400 people each compared to 135 a few weeks ago 
peru an impoverished andean nation of 22 million is caught in 
the double stranglehold of severe economic crisis and its worst 
drought of the century 
when president alberto fujimori took office july 28 he 
inherited annual inflation of 3000 percent and disastrous 
unemployment only one of five peruvians has a steady job 
fujimori imposed austerity measures including elimination of 
subsidies on staple foods to curb inflation that was what drove 
prices up 
to help the poorest survive the government created an emergency 
food aid program to provide relief for an estimated 7 million 
peruvians officials now say the number needing help has risen to 
115 million 
officials said aid would be channeled through soup kitchens 
religious organizations and neighborhood groups that administer a 
government program to give each needy child a free glass of milk a 
day 
church organizations say they get only a fraction of the help 
they need 
the health ministry isnt paying salaries said josephine 
gilman director of prisma a churchaffiliated charity health 
workers are threatening to steal the food theyre supposed to 
distribute 
over the chaotic scene hangs the specter of malnutrition 
cocina popular meals often thin soups of rice and vegetables 
with a minimum of meat or fish are not very nourishing 
a nutritional research center called alternative says the meals 
provide only 473 calories and 16 grams of protein far short of the 
basic daily requirements of 2410 calories and 65 grams of protein 
in one soup kitchen in the santa rosa de naranjal shantytown 
two women chopped up 4 pounds of beef a luxury 
it has to stretch for 200 portions of soup one said 
standing nearby were children with bleached hair and swollen 
bellies the marks of malnutrition and parasites 
unicef the united nations childrens fund says 128 of every 
1000 peruvian children die before age 5 a level comparable to 
some african countries 
santa rosa de naranjal receives 55 pounds of fish a day for 600 
people and a weeks worth of flour must last a month the 15 cents 
the kitchens charge for a meal does little to supplement the skimpy 
government donations 
perus barely functional bureaucracy makes things worse 
transport problems and bickering between customs and health 
ministry officials have stranded thousands of tons of donated food 
in warehouses at limas port of callao where it falls prey to rats 
and mold 
the bankrupt state oil company will not supply kerosene to the 
soup kitchens as its part in the emergency program unless the 
government pays for it the state food company has run out of money 
to finance the milk program 
tomas alcedo of the relief agency care said government aid is 
disorganized and just isnt big enough to deal with the problem 
peruvians joke bitterly of suffering the biblical plagues the 
drought a major earthquake in the jungle in june even locusts a 
volcano near the southern city of arequipa is threatening to erupt 
outside a governmentrun soup kitchen in limas decaying 
downtown thousands of people line up every day at 8 am the 
kitchens budget has been halved to 1500 rations a day and 
thousands are turned away 
lunch is thin fare wheat soup a tiny piece of fish and rice 
but people scuffle to get into line for it two policemen with 
automatic weapons enforce the closing of the doors at 1 pm 
there should be preference for babies said a toothless 
father who had waited five hours in vain with his thin 3monthold 
daughter in his arms

the rev eugene hebert an american 
jesuit was riding down the road on his red motorscooter aug 15 
and a red cross nurse waved at him from a passing van he has not 
been seen since 
almost any groups involved in the chaos of sri lankas communal 
hatreds and savage civil war might be responsible for his 
disappearance 
hundreds of people were killed on sri lankas east coast during 
august in ethnic slaughter among tamils moslems and sinhalese 
father hebert neither participant nor bystander got caught in 
the middle 
when last seen the 67yearold priest was returning the 
technical school at st michaels college in batticaloa 135 miles 
east of colombo capital of sri lanka 
bertram francis a tamil student was riding on the passenger 
seat the nurse waved to them 12 to 15 miles outside the town 
the rev harry miller a fellow jesuit who came here with hebert 
42 years ago said this is what he thinks happened there was 
someone somewhere who took exception to this tamil boy and tried 
to take him away father hebert being what he was defended the 
boy to the death 
a us diplomat described hebert one of five foreign priests at 
st michaels as the first american casualty of the 7yearold 
civil war he is presumed dead although neither his body nor the 
scooter has been found 
about 400 people most of them tamils have been reported 
missing in this eastern district in the new round of ethnic war 
that began in june miller said he accused the army in heberts 
case but said he believed it was a tragic blunder 
hebert arrived in sri lanka from jennings la in 1948 the 
year the paradise island then known as ceylon became independent of 
britain he was a teacher parish priest director of the technical 
school and the toughest basketball coach in the country 
some army officers called him a white tiger because he 
interceded for tamil youths detained on suspicion of aiding 
guerrillas of the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
he was a very popular man in this area a tamil businessman 
said he was the only priest who wouldnt get off his bike at an 
army checkpoint 
hebert always had a strong conviction that he was safe 
miller said 
a few days before his disappearance after a tamil priest was 
stoned and beaten by a moslem mob hebert turned to miller and 
another priest and said you know sooner or later one of us will 
go be killed 
when the conflict between the sinhalese who dominate sri lanka 
and the minority tamils became acute in the early 1980s hebert and 
some other roman catholic priests warned of a bloodbath and 
counseled conciliation 
the tamils 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people claim 
discrimination by the sinhalese who make up 75 percent 
since fighting resumed june 11 the army has regained control of 
the towns and most roads in the east conceding the jungle and 
remote villages to the tigers 
in batticaloa a town of 40000 tamils between the sea and a 
lagoon life deteriorated after the army took over according to 
miller and tamil residents 
schools are shut most tamilowned businesses are closed and 
others open only in the mornings 
food is scarce and arrives only sporadically by truck convoy 
people stay indoors after 2 pm in a voluntary curfew born of fear 
young tamils dread what they call arbitrary arrest dozens of 
unidentifiable bodies have been seen burning in the streets 
a senior army officer who spoke in an unauthorized interview 
and refused to let his name be used denied any impropriety he 
said the bodies of tigers killed in skirmishes were burned because 
there was no one to bury them 
while a reporter was visiting a tamil politician soldiers 
entered the house searched it checked the identity papers of his 
employees and took a 19yearold away for questioning the youth 
was released soon afterward 
moslems and tamils often live in adjacent villages outside 
batticaloa they speak the same language and apart from religion 
share the same culture 
most tamils are hindus but many in the batticaloa area are 
christians except for occasional trouble that began about two 
years ago the tamils and moslems had lived together harmoniously 
the resumption of war in june began a period of brutality 
including decapitation and mutilation that has exceeded anything 
before it 
different sides trace it to different events and each community 
professes innocence 
one of the worst massacres took place aug 11 in eravur a 
moslem village just north of batticaloa attackers suspected of 
being tigers killed 127 people by shooting or hacking them to death 
four days later eravur was on heberts route home to batticaloa 
from valachchenai 15 miles north where he met with tamil priests 
and nuns who felt threatened by the violence 
tamils fleeing moslem vengeance and army arrests had abandoned 
the villages between eravur and valachchenai and there was no 
traffic on the road miller said 
at first everyone concluded it was the moslems who killed 
him now i dont think so he said if the moslems were 
responsible miller added it would have been another incident of 
mob violence and could not be kept secret 
he never got to eravur heberts friend said there was 
only one other operating agent in that area and that is the 
army he said 
military officials said a convoy had been expected that day and 
soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards along the road

an unlikely history and lingering mystery mingle 
in a song that infused the old rural south emerged in the civil 
rights movement gained popularity and now has advanced into the 
loftiest hymnals 
aspects of the song amazing grace are somewhat amazing 
themselves and haunting 
theres a kind of wonderful calm that i feel when i sing this 
a kind of uncomplicated feeling the way one felt as a child 
says operatic contralto jessye norman 
country singer johnny cash says its a song with no guile 
straightahead honest gutlevel and heartlevel when i sing 
that song i could be in a dungeon or i could have chains all over 
me but id be free as a breeze 
the lyrics were by a reformed 18thcentury slave trader the 
variable melody clouded in folk origins conceivably among slaves 
it imbued their ensuing culture and later spread through a 
sophisticated world 
now a favorite american hymn amazing grace also turns up 
occasionally in rock concerts and has been rendered in some 
foreign languages 
there is a power of reconciliation that takes place when i 
hear it says broadcaster bill moyers who depicts the story and 
impact of the hymn in an 80minute show being presented wednesday 
by the public broadcasting service 
the first verse goes amazing grace how sweet the sound that 
saved a wretch like me i once was lost but now am found was blind 
but now i see 
the words were by john newton skipper of a british slave ship 
who traded for human cargo in west africa a storm at sea sparked 
religious faith and he later became an anglican minister in olney 
england 
i was once an active instrument in a business at which my 
heart now shudders newton wrote in his journals a common 
drunkard or profligate is a petty sinner to what i was oh to 
grace how great a debtor 
newton became an advocate for abolishing the slave trade his 
journals describing its brutality helped an ally william 
wilberforce win british abolition of it 
twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears 
relieved goes the second verse how precious did that grace 
appear the hour i first believed 
in the film singer judy collins says 
it was always the song that gave me an inner experience of 
another dimension i always feel that theres a mystical territory 
between me and the audience 
its not just me singing somewhere or other there is 
some experience going on which gives something to them and gives 
something to me thats more than the sum of any of us 
the third verse goes the lord has promised good to me his 
word my hope secures he will my shield and portion be as long as 
life endures 
says gospel singer marion williams it gets to most everybody 
it gets to the heart of men 
an aged black wiregrass song leader dewey williams says at 
his 91st birthday party in ozark ark i feel good i just cant 
help it when i get to singing that song it just do something to 
me 
the show ranges over many settings from 18thcentury sailing 
ships to concert halls from prisons to mississippi voter 
registration drives from cemeteries to shape note singing in 
holly springs ga 
says a holly springs man its just a good song wrote like 
its supposed to be wrote 
on a tour of japan by the boys choir of harlem director walter 
turnbull says some foreigners dont understand the songs words 
but it has such a universal flavor and the meldoy itself is so 
beautiful it captures people 
the fourth verse goes through many dangers toils and 
snares i have already come tis grace that brought me safe thus 
far and grace will lead me home 
in a huntsville texas prison an inmate says i couldnt 
hardly sing that song and get through you know four verses of it 
without choking up all i could do was just be humming and 
crying 
shown engraved on newtons tombstone are his words 
once an infidel and libertine a servant of slaves in africa 
was by the rich mercy of our lord and savior jesus christ 
preserved restored pardoned and appointed to preach the faith he 
had long labored to destroy 
the fifth verse goes when weve been there ten thousand 
years bright shining as the sun weve no less days to sing gods 
praise than when wed first begun 
a harlem choir boy says of his reaction to the song 
i feel like im walking on a beach and like wind is hitting 
me and stuff like that thats how i feel about it not like a 
rough wind like a soft wind just coming by like a breeze

in his latest role jesse jackson describes 
himself as a journalist with a mission in other callings civil 
rights activist contender for democratic presidential nominations 
candidate to be an unpaid shadow senator for the district of 
columbia journalists cover his missions 
jackson went to iraq to interview saddam hussein then gained 
entry to kuwait on his first outing as a television interviewer he 
flew home sunday with 47 americans who had been held hostage there 
one of them said that but for jacksons intercession they would 
not be free the white house concurred a spokesman praising 
jacksons effort and saying the administration had cooperated 
that blurring of the roles of interviewer hostage negotiator 
and freelance diplomat fits the pattern of a persian gulf crisis 
in which television is part of the weaponry ironically jackson 
himself complained about live television diplomacy saying 
diplomats should be negotiating directly not arguing 
electronically 
if talking is impossible then war becomes inevitable he 
said in the first of four inside edition programs based on his 
trip to iraq thats only a preview of the televised jackson his 
own syndicated talk show is to begin later this month a rival tv 
syndicator paid 125000 to send jackson and a crew of 14 on the 
trip to iraq after he had shopped among other organizations and 
networks for sponsorship 
i am fundamentally a communicator and journalism is 
communication jackson said sunday i do not believe in 
abstract journalism it has to have a mission 
jacksons own missions are multiple and hard to classify he is 
the rev jesse jackson he heads the rainbow coalition he 
intercedes in labor disputes crusades against drugs mounts 
boycotts against businesses deemed to be shirking in the 
advancement of black employees and executives 
he has run twice for the democratic presidential nomination and 
early surveys show his wide name recognition places him in the 
front rank of prospects for the 1992 campaign 
jackson isnt saying what hell do then as a champion of 
statehood for the district of columbia he is running now to be one 
of the two shadow senators who will be official lobbyists for 
that cause there are four candidates and a jackson victory is a 
near certainty another is that the capital wont become a state 
any time soon 
a plan to appropriate 13 million in city funds to pay salaries 
and office expenses for the shadow senators was scrapped because of 
the budget crunch so the job wont pay a salary nor will it 
provide the senate floor access that jackson had hoped to gain 
then again jackson doesnt seem to need a position or a title 
in order to promote his causes his image and his political aims 
hes been doing it for years at home and abroad meeting with the 
heads of more than 60 governments 
selfstarting diplomats sometimes have irked prior 
administrations but there was no overt sign of it this time 
although jackson had claimed at one point that the government was 
trying to discourage sponsorship of his trip 
the president is pleased by jesses success in bringing 
back americans and we are grateful that he was able to make those 
arrangements said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
he was successful and thats important he did get 
american lives out we did cooperate 
in january 1984 jackson had negotiated the release of a navy 
pilot held by syria after his jet was shot down during a raid on 
syrian antiaircraft positions in the mountains of lebanon 
he said relatives of iraqi hostages had contacted him for help 
looking to him because he had succeeded before 
when he flew home with navy lt robert o goodman jr in 1984 
one of the reporters who traveled with them was terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent of the associated press anderson 
himself was taken hostage in beirut in march 1985 and has been 
held since longer than any other western hostage in lebanon

buying a home is supposed to be the american 
dream for many people that dream has been dampened by the effects 
of the savings and loan crisis which has made victims of both 
buyers and sellers this the second of a threepart series sampls 
on main street examines how the crisis has battered one 
midsized city 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in many places the savings and 
loan crisis seems a faroff fury unknown people swindling faceless 
institutions in complicated ways with vague consequences 
but in colorado springs as in many cities across the country 
the consequences have undermined everyday life by exacerbating an 
already depressed economy 
three of the six local sampls went under this year a surviving 
thrift seeks to reassure listeners in its radio ads that weve 
been in business over 70 years sale signs in suburban yards 
proclaim bankowned headlines in the real estate section 
scream repo 
some people cant get out of their homes some cant get into 
homes sellers have to swallow bigger losses because prices are 
depressed by the huge inventory of governmentowned homes hanging 
over the market buyers have trouble getting mortgages because 
money is tight qualifying is harder and rules are much stricter 
the sampl crisis says national association of home builders 
economist dean crist is hitting main street now 
in the mid1980s colorado springs exploded as a high tech high 
rollin military mecca that grew from 214000 residents in 1980 to 
about 300000 before the energy and defense booms went bust in the 
late 80s 
overbuilt and overappraised commercial and residential real 
estate prices dropped through the basement developers simply 
walked away from their debts so did homeowners caught in the 
squeeze between lost jobs and high mortgages their houses were 
repossessed by banks sampls or the federal government 
this year three sampls were taken over by government regulators 
two were sold one simply was shut down when no one offered to buy 
it and the repossessed properties settled into government hands 
today government agencies estimate they are offering for sale 
as many as 2200 singlefamily houses in the area thats almost 
half the 4620 singlefamily homes listed for sale by the pikes 
peak association of realtors multiplelisting service at the end of 
august 
steve barron a local realtor said the sampl crisis didnt cause 
the depressed market in colorado springs but it added to it 
what the sampls did was make money available for building on a 
speculative basis said barron they loaned money at 100 
percent rather than force a down payment all that overbuilding is 
what you see now 
the sampl crisis has lowered market values throughout the 
city said realtor cliff snyder 
barron views it as an opportunity for some people who were shut 
out of the housing market because of inflated prices during the 
1980s heyday 
the sampl collapse has created a window of opportunity for 
people who couldnt buy in back in 87 he said houses are as 
low now as theyre ever going to get this chance will never come 
again 
but the veteran realtor acknowledges that the sampl crisis 
coupled with a sluggish national economy and colorado springs 
overdevelopment has changed the way he and his colleagues approach 
clients 
the real estate community as a whole is much more cautious 
about the way they do business when they represent the seller 
they insist on a job history and a credit report on the buyer 
barron said 
heck in the 1980s if a buyer had a pulse he qualified now 
its gone to the other extreme he said 
were looking at a lot of retrenching its much tighter now 
much tougher to buy a home said charles grayson a banker in 
colorado springs 
judy and dave crenshaw can testify to that they had to go to 
three different mortgage companies and deal with two government 
agencies before they finally were able to buy a home here 
the government has tightened their belts so extremely that it 
has made it very difficult for people like us said mrs 
crenshaw we got caught in the squeeze 
the crenshaws lost out on one home because an appraisal fell 
more than 11000 short of the loan they were seeking that 
appraisal really did us in she said with disgust it was very 
stressful for us 
two months later they bought a new twostory home with a full 
basement for 80000 even that wasnt easy 
it took us three or four weeks longer to get the house than we 
expected and cost us more money because of the delay said mrs 
crenshaw a civil service employee at the fort carson army hospital 
the resolution trust corp the government agency established to 
sell properties acquired through failed sampls requires buyers in 
colorado springs to spend an extra 25 for credit counseling 
with such fierce competition in the marketplace barron said 
that extra fee might make the difference between selling an rtc 
home and one just like it down the block offered by a private 
buyer and financed by a mortgage lender who doesnt charge for 
advice 
were talking about buyers without a lot of disposable 
income said barron why should they have to pay 25 to rtc for 
something they can get free someplace else 
barron will not take his buyers to any sampl for financial 
assistance too unstable too many hassles too risky he said 
why add to the trauma and stress with a technically 
incompetent or unstable lender its a question of confidence will 
they still be there next week said barron i dont know 
anybody in my office using a savings and loan regularly today 
kerry wanner concurs 
word is spreading among brokers and agents said wanner a 
broker were bottomline people when you go to an sampl and you 
cant get the job done you dont go there anymore

fivefoottall rare porcelain vases stand guard at the entrance to 
a french restaurant employees stand in hallways just to answer any 
questions that might happen by 
to some the phoenician resort epitomizes excellence to others 
it is a monument to excess and extravagance paid for by the 
nowinsolvent lincoln savings amp loan 
but for anyone who spends a night there its hard to believe 
this 275 million desert oasis actually is a governmentowned and 
operated property 
if the governments running it theyre doing a wonderful job 
id say this is one of their more successful ventures frederick 
shaw a westfield nj physician said with a chuckle its the 
nicest resort ive ever stayed in 
club fed as it is called locally was seized by fbi agents 
last november after federal regulators took over lincoln from 
charles keating the phoenix developer blamed for one of the 
costliest of all sampl failures 
as if the phoenicians ownership wasnt troublesome enough 
iraqs invasion of kuwait created some figurative ripples through 
the seven swimming pools here too 
lincoln savings owned 55 percent of the resort the share now 
in the hands of the federal resolution trust corp the londonbased 
kuwait investment office owns the remaining 45 percent 
they assured us the investment is secure phoenician 
spokeswoman sally cooper said of the kuwaitis 
the us government continues to run the palmfilled oasis 
hiring an austrian hotelier to manage the 130acre resort until a 
buyer can be found 
no attempt has been made to sell the hotel because of pending 
litigation and the kuwaitis have the first right of refusal rtc 
spokesman kevin shields said 
the phoenician is one of the bestknown of all the thousands of 
properties now in the hands of the federal government acquired 
through failed sampls 
it became both a symbol of the sampl excess and a battleground 
for keating who claims sampl regulators didnt understand his 
business and conspired to ruin his deals 
regulators for their part claim keating looted lincoln 
savings using it as his own piggy bank to finance a lavish 
lifestyle for his family and build speculative white elephant 
projects like the resort which they say has lost millions since 
its october 1988 opening 
its very opulent and extravagant shields said this is 
not something sampls should go around building 
so heated is the feud between keating and regulators that when 
the government ousted keatings management of the phoenician fbi 
agents confiscated documents and changed the locks on the doors 
phoenician management now says the resort is breaking even on a 
cashflow basis but thats not a true picture the rtc says 
because the phoenicians balance sheet carries no debt lincoln 
footed the 275 million bill for building the resort 
the question is can it really make a profit shields said 
what price will we be able to sell it in order for the buyer to 
make it profitable 
while all the wrangling has gone on few if any reservations 
have been canceled because of the mess 
really all of this has not had any adverse effect if 
anything curiosity was piqued said ms cooper 
dennis beljan was curious he and his wife came from nearby 
mesa ariz for a golf holiday because i knew it was supposed to 
be a super property 
it exceeds some of the higher quality resorts in the area 
beljan said you dont feel any government presence at all

one hundred and fifty years of dinners at 
antoines hardly show at all and thats the way everyone likes it 
sure the gas jets in the old brass chandeliers have given way 
to electricity and the ceiling fans now stir airconditioned 
breezes on muggy days but if antoine alciatore were to walk in 
today hed find the biggest change is in the clientele 
on any given night id say we have someone worth writing 
about in here someone famous or notorious many people who are 
intriguing said bernard r guste proprietor of the famous 
french quarter restaurant its like home for a lot of the people 
who come here when they want a good meal they want to come home 
we keep it pretty much the way its always been 
started as a modest rooming house and restaurant when it opened 
in 1840 antonies has become a hallmark of excellent food and 
elegant dining in a city where both are revered 
just a couple of blocks from the blare of bourbon street where 
jazz bars vie with strip joints antoines draws local residents 
tourists and the rich and famous 
some diners over the years seven american presidents royalty 
including princess margaret princess anne and the duke and duchess 
of windsor writers such as mark twain sinclair lewis and william 
faulkner entertainers from sarah bernhardt to groucho marx to 
linda ronstadt and sports celebrities including babe ruth jack 
nicklaus and joe montana 
when pope john paul ii visited new orleans in 1988 guste and 
three of antoines waiters were chosen to cook for him and serve 
him at the archbishops residence 
he was the nicest fellow you could ever meet said wiley 
smith who has been a waiter at antoines for 43 years all these 
big people are nice its a education in itself to be at antoines 
i always say i could have traveled the world three times over and 
not met all the people ive met here 
smith 65 should know he served harry truman when he dined at 
antoines and richard nixon as well 
he shrugs off the list of celebrities its too long to itemize 
i like serving the young people who come in he said 
theyre so enthusiastic you know its a big night for them and 
it will be a special memory i like that 
the 33 waiters at antoines have 875 years total years 
experience guste said most of it with his restaurant 
our young waiters start as apprentices to our older waiters 
its a role model thing i tell them you start to walk and talk 
and think like this man and youll make it guste said 
regulars at antoines have their own personal waiters who serve 
them each time they visit and whose names they drop when making 
reservations 
its sort of like having your own doctor guste said they 
know how you like your sauce if you want ice cubes how much bread 
to put on your table you dont have to ask the man serving you 
probably served your father and maybe your grandfather 
guste 42 who started working at antoines in 1967 as a 
cashier is the greatgreat grandson of antoine alciatore for five 
generations he said the restaurant never has been open without a 
family member present making it what he calls the oldest 
restaurant in the united states operated by the same family 
if youre looking for modern dishes light food are 
counting calories or concerned about cholesterol antoines is 
definitely a place to avoid 
the french creole cuisine dished out in the restaurants 16 
private dining rooms hasnt varied much during the last 150 years 
the dishes on the menu which is written in french are 
generously covered with butter and cream bearnaise sauce with its 
nine egg yolks cream sauce made with a quart of halfandhalf and 
rochambeau sauce with almost a cup of butter 
the recipe for oysters rockefeller perhaps the most famous dish 
at antoines is a family secret reportedly stashed in a vault in 
the restaurant but the taste is wellknown almost 3 million 
orders have been served 
the restaurants wine cellar contains more than 25000 bottles 
the oldest wines date from 1884 a brandy was produced in 1811 
prohibition was tough on the restaurant guste said our 
type of food calls for wine my grandfather thought it was terrible 
when customers had to have water instead 
dinner at antoines is not only the name of a frances 
parkinson keyes novel for those who can afford the tab 30 to 
50 without wine or tip its an experience guste said 
reserve early though regulars have standing reservations from 
year to year for holidays like new years eve christmas eve and 
mardi gras and two of the dining rooms the japanese room and the 
1890 room already have been reserved for new years eve 1999 for 
turnofthecentury parties

sometimes when the pain in her belly and 
her toothpickthin legs tears at her lissette rodriguez thinks of 
heaven 
when mom dies i die everyone dies i can walk in there 
she says in her frail voice no pain in my stomach no pain in my 
knee and i walk again 
sometimes her chest feels so tight she cant breathe 
sometimes those who love her cant hold her because her 40pound 
body is so brittle that she bleeds inside 
in these excruciating moments sandy as she is nicknamed 
prays she asks god to take the pain away 
barely 12 years old sandy is dying of aids for her death is 
represented by the concept of heaven where everything is beautiful 
you close your eyes and your body is not working she says 
then you go to god go to jesus in a big place where he lives my 
father is in there everyone who dies goes there 
sandys doctor dr laura hoyt said every part of the girls 
body from her head to her toes is not working properly her 
brain lungs heart liver kidneys blood immune system 
weve had her on hospice care at home since last spring the 
doctor said we are keeping her as comfortable as possible for as 
long as possible she hates being in the hospital and doesnt want 
to die in the hospital 
sandy is among the nearly 2500 children under 13 who have 
contracted fullblown aids since the epidemic began the centers 
for disease control in atlanta reported in august that more than 
1300 of those children have died in the united states and its 
territories 
sandy was born four weeks prematurely in new york city the 
woman she knows as her mother carmen candelaria is really her 
aunt mrs candelaria took sandy and another child from her own 
sister when they were born because the sister was unable to care 
for them 
sandy contracted aids through a blood transfusion needed because 
of her early birth mrs candelaria said the girls natural mother 
died two years ago at age 41 after mixing valium and alcohol at a 
party she said 
mrs candelaria said she knows nothing about sandys father her 
own husband the man sandy knew as her father was killed when 
sandy was 7 in a holdup in the video store he owned in puerto rico 
where they lived for five years 
i miss my father sandy says i miss him every day every 
night 
sandy hasnt walked since last december she spent from 
christmas through march in the hospital and watched her friend 
christina from puerto rico die of aids on new years eve 
i was scared she says soon her eyes were closed her 
mother is crying her father is crying i started crying i said 
i want to see her she was covered her hair was a mess all 
gone i miss her shes gone to heaven she moved from the islands 
to god 
mrs candelaria threw a big barbecue may 1 for sandys 12th 
birthday and invited the people at the hospital who care for her 
sandy who weighed 60 pounds then mustered the strength to blow 
out the candles and got icing on her nose 
she celebrated her first communion not in a church but in the 
hospital where she returned at the end of may when her condition 
worsened 
for mrs candelaria it was bittersweet she is tormented by the 
picture in her mind she is unable to shake the image of a little 
girl with brown hair and eyes white lace dress and stockings 
locket around her tiny neck in a wheelchair surrounded by nurses 
a cake decorated with the sentiments jesus loves lissette we 
do too 
i just got sad said mrs candelaria i wanted it to be 
not in the hospital but a real normal communion she told me not 
to cry if i cry shell cry they both cried 
sandy is attached to mrs candelaria wanting her there every 
moment even sleeping with her mrs candelaria is her shadow and 
has devoted much of her life to caring for her 
she is mrs candelarias protector never talking to her about 
the inevitable 
she knows mrs candelaria said she never talks to me 
about dying she sees me cry too many times 
each day brings a new onslaught of pain for sandy diarrhea 
coughing fever fungus itching her blackandblue body is 
replenished with new blood every month transfusions to keep her 
alive and platelets to help stem the diseases tide 
a hug a kiss a banged foot can start internal bleeding 
i have a pain in here sandy says rubbing her stomach 
sometimes i throw it up sometimes i get mad at doreen 
doreen small her devoted nurse said sandy always fights with 
her 
then she says shes sorry im the focus of her anger which 
is ok when shes in a good mood shell paint pictures for me i 
have a bunch of pictures 
a luxury for sandy is to have her feet rubbed she asks anyone 
who is handy to accommodate her when her cousin lues rivera 
jokingly threatened to stop one day she teased him in spanish i 
dare you 
sandy is a prisoner of her bed cared for at home by her mother 
and the center for hope hospice 
dont put me in there yet she orders ms small afraid she 
may never get back out to do all the things she wants 
her bedroom is filled with a cabinet of survival gear sterile 
water saline gauze diapers dressing kits needles to flush her 
iv 
her link to life is a catheter that enters her chest nourishing 
her with food vitamins minerals and dextrose the thrush 
infection from her mouth to her stomach and the medicine have 
killed her appetite 
sometimes the food at the hospital i dont like it she 
says a treat for her is pizza and french fries but she can handle 
only a few bites 
her constant companions are her makebelieve friend poopy who 
takes her shopping a doll called baby bubbles whom she hugs and 
rocks and the telephone she frequently calls poopy to take her 
shopping and to chitchat i want to see my grandmother and cousin 
you see the movie mermaid i like the sound 
when you think how limited her life is thats her only 
contact to the outside world said ms small 
her dreams are simple to get out of her bed to go to school 
to see her classmates and the new kids on the block to have 
another party to fly to puerto rico to visit her grandmother to 
see the clouds from the plane 
i dont want to die never never she cries i want to 
live

its an oasis of gentility a bastion of british 
tradition a purveyor of the national drink shepherds tea room is 
also part of a renaissance tea never fell out of favor in england 
but tea rooms did now theyre coming back 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a country that takes its tea 
seriously shepherds tea room gets top marks from the industry 
insiders at home as well as from an innocent abroad my mother 
from among thousands of tea shops across england this oasis of 
gentility was given the 1990 top tea place of the year award by the 
tea council limited which represents british tea packagers and 
distributors as well as six other teaproducing countries 
perhaps more impressive to me was the reaction of my vacationing 
mother who lives in texas where tea means iced tea and people who 
drink it hot are suspicioned as foreigners she put shepherds 
right up there with buckingham palace parliament and the tower 
bridge as fun places to visit 
its so quaint said mother lorrain rubin of houston and 
how civilized to stop for tea in the late afternoon 
beyond the bright purple door of the stately redbrick georgian 
home shepherds tea room is a vision of pale pink walls flowers 
and lace tablecloths an aria from a french opera plays faintly 
beneath soft conversations 
a wellgroomed young waiter escorts us to a table in a sunny 
room and mother says i like this place everyone here is my 
age 
at one table four grayhaired ladies in sensible shoes discuss 
the thoroughbreds racing in the days glorious goodwood an annual 
event for englands horsey aristocracy a group of young women with 
wellbehaved children sit on our right a gentleman reading the 
times of london to our left 
the tea room on london street serves 700 pots of tea a week to 
customers most of whom are regulars 
we get lots of older single ladies says the proprietor 
richard spence 32 they know that even if they come alone they 
will find companions with whom to have a nice chat 
indeed the tea room has become an institution in this ancient 
town noted for its georgian architecture and fine harbor for 
sailing enthusiasts located on an estuary on englands southern 
coast about 55 miles south of london 
richards wife and coowner yvonne adds one chap said his 
mother comes because the people she will find here are people she 
would have in her front parlor its a safe place 
tea rooms always have been a haven for women a century ago 
they were just about the only public place a lady could venture 
unchaperoned and maintain a good reputation 
the first recorded english tea room was a womans idea in 1864 
the manager of a bread shop near london bridge started serving tea 
to her favorite customers and before long everyone wanted some 
the idea brewed a while and then she asked the bakery directors 
if she could sell pots of tea with scones the result was a 
smashing success tea shops became a part of the nations heritage 
and part of every englishmans childhood 
no saturday shopping trip was complete without a stop for tea 
and scones afternoon tea dances held in london after the world war 
i attracted crowds 
the spences bought their tea room in 1987 six months after they 
were married both had been managers for large hotel chains but 
wanted to do something together 
they added the lace bought modern white bone china and revamped 
the menu traditional english dishes such as welsh rarebit and 
ploughmans platters are now served alongside healthy salads 
sandwiches and filled baked potatoes 
mother ordered rarebit and i chose a savory meat lasagne a dish 
i loved as a child 
hows your lasagne mother asked 
its really good i replied but not as good as yours 
she smiled and finished lunch with a slice of rich chocolate 
mousse cake i chose the treacle tart and whipped cream from among 
a refrigerated case of homemade shortbread iced tea cakes walnut 
layer cake rice crispy squares and caramel bars 
then we had tea a pot of spicy china black for her and a peach 
fruit tea for me 
the tea was delicious tasting nothing like common american tea 
that is brewed fromnd often tastes slightly bitter 
and stewed 
shepherds also serves earl grey darjeeling ceylon afternoon 
tea camomile lemon kiwi and blackcurrant teas the man who sells 
the spenc bleached bags aes their tea has combined assam ceylon and african 
leaves 
for a special english breakfast tea that the spences serve and sell 
by mail 
but the quality of the tea was only one of many criteria used by 
judges in awarding the prize they also were impressed by the tea 
rooms courteous staff cleanliness and ambience 
other tea rooms that received awards of excellence from the tea 
council this year were 
the commodore hotel in instow devon the tea shoppe in hutchison

president mengistu haile mariam 
beams and waves to the masses from a huge billboard in addis 
ababas main square 
beneath it a uniformed security guard uses a stick to control 
the hundreds of ethiopians who besiege the immigration department 
every day for exit visas 
one of them the wife of a ranking politician shares a 
whispered joke with a visitor we like to think hes waving 
goodbye 
mengistu who gained power after a military coup toppled emperor 
haile selassie in 1974 seems determined to hang on despite 
military diplomatic and economic setbacks 
consider his problems 
two major guerrilla armies have demoralized a military made up 
largely of forcibly enlisted youngsters with little training and 
less inclination to fight for mengistu 
after nearly three decades of war secessionist rebels occupy 
nearly all of eritrea the northernmost province a smaller allied 
force holds neighboring tigre province and has swept southward to 
within 100 miles of the capital 
the soviet union for 13 years ethiopias ally and arms 
supplier has withdrawn most of its military advisers has reduced 
weapons shipments and recommends negotiations to settle ethiopias 
internal conflicts cuban advisers also have left 
ethiopia says the military absorbs half its annual budget the 
economy is in tatters the arms debt to the soviet union is 
estimated at 5 billion to 6 billion and moscow indicates it 
expects to be paid western nations and international lending 
agencies to which ethiopia owes an additional 2 billion to 3 
billion also expect payment 
famine is an almost constant threat particularly in the 
north where drought and war have limited harvests for years more 
than 1 million people died in the last great famine in 198485 
and only continuing relief efforts have prevented a repetition 
anywhere else in the world a leader confronted with such a 
litany of disasters would have bowed out but our man will brave it 
out said an ethiopian political scientist 
how long mengistu can do so may depend on eritrea nearly a 
third of his 315800man army is under siege in the eritrean 
capital asmara surrounded by rebels of the eritrean peoples 
liberation front 
mengistu has acknowledged the fall of asmara could bring down 
his government diplomats in addis ababa say he is determined to 
hold the provincial capital 
dawit wolde giorgis a former ethiopian official who headed the 
relief program in the 198485 famine and now lives in new jersey 
said mengistu has lost control of the country but still 
prevails in the capital primarily because the opposition 
movements are disunited 
there is no real source of strength in the regime except the 
machinery of terror and need for economic survival he said 
perhaps 100000 people in the establishment are loyal to him 
because they know that their life and security depend on the 
survival of mengistu 
goshu wolde a former foreign minister now living in maryland 
said the army could dislodge mengistu but its main forces are on 
the war fronts and the military is under surveillance he said 
past coup attempts failed for lack of resources and organization 
some observers suggest the eritreans could seize asmara any time 
they chose because they have popular support and most governemnt 
soldiers probably would quit fighting 
others believe an assault on asmara might panic the defenders 
into burning the elegant garden city once the capital of italys 
prized african colony 
i think theyd rather starve it into surrender one analyst 
said the commanders would probably fly out before the end and 
the city would be wide open 
a desire to starve rather than destroy asmara may lie behind the 
rebels refusal to reopen the nearby port of massawa some 
diplomats say 
massawa one of ethiopias two red sea ports has been idle 
since the rebels captured it in early february 
two months ago the united nations thought it had the agreement 
of both the government and rebels to send a damageinspection team 
to massawa 
at the last minute however the rebels refused entry to the 
ship carrying the team the eritreans have not explained the 
action but some analysts in addis ababa say the rebels may have 
feared any food delivered through massawa would primarily benefit 
mengistus beseiged 2nd army 
an estimated 400000 civilians live in asmara and the small 
surrounding area still held by the 2nd army a force of about 
120000 
food is supplied to the civilians by a un airlift from assab 
ethiopias other port far down the coast near somalia the 
government also flies in arms and food for the soldiers 
eritreans outside the besieged area are fed adequately if not 
abundantly by a relief effort run by the rebels from neighboring 
sudan 
the food is getting into asmara but its not enough and its 
not clear whether the army is laying claim to some of it said a 
european diplomat familiar with the un airlift which began july 
1 
mengistu responded to the economic crisis earlier this year by 
scrapping the marxist policies his government had followed for 15 
years and encouraging foreign investment many diplomats say it was 
too little too late and point to signs of increasing corruption 
and poverty 
as the economy deteriorates and the tigre peoples liberation 
front moves ever southward toward addis ababa residents of the 
capital are getting jittery 
in addition to the long lines at the immigration department 
about 100 people a day apply for visas at the us embassy those 
with money hoard food gasoline and water and the black market in 
foreign currencies is brisk

in a land of famine and war the 
privileged few feast and frolic 
of ethiopias 50 million people one in 15 faces starvation and 
at least 8 million are trapped in areas being contested by 
government and rebel armies at the other extreme are the 2000 
diplomats and expatriates and a few hundred rich ethiopian 
families 
although rebels of the tigre peoples liberation front have 
advanced to within 100 miles of addis ababa there are no signs of 
panic among foreigners 
they play roulette at the ghion casino order lobster or salmon 
at the jacaranda restaurant play tennis or swim at the hilton 
hotel get together in a steady round of cocktail parties and spend 
weekends at lakeside resorts a few hours drive away 
for most expatriates and ethiopians with hard currency all 
roads lead to the stateowned victory store a fantasyland of 
luxuries on the outskirts far from the pickpockets beggars 
urchins and hawkers who hound shoppers in downtown addis ababa 
its open to anyone with who has dollars in this oneparty 
state whose leaders preached marxism until recently 
other state stores are short of basics like sugar cooking oil 
and rice the victory has french cheeses italian wines danish 
hams tunisian sardines american cookies and ketchup australian 
canned fruits and vegetables and belgian pates 
it also stocks french perfumes spanish shoes japanese 
television sets and video recorders and british refrigerators and 
stoves 
shoppers can relax over coffee or a beer in the victorys own 
red lion pub while their bills are totaled or scan the bulletin 
board for what departing diplomats and others have to offer from 
cars or compact disc players for sale to houses for rent 
foreigners often spend more here in a day than we get in a 
year said an ethiopian clerk at the victory who earns the 
equivalent of about 60 a month its difficult to keep a smile 
when were serving them 
a jewelbedecked woman led four loaded carts out of the store 
a months groceries worth more than 900 she tipped the ethiopians 
who pushed the carts 1 each

there are no violins or bright 
costumes in this ragtag gypsy settlement 30 miles from budapest 
just the memory of centuries of oppression and a skeptical view of 
the future 
four decades of communism did little to temper the bitter 
history of gypsies in eastern europe and the coming of democracy 
is not enough to inspire trust within the dirtfloored shacks of 
kerepestarcsa 
most inhabitants wear dirty handmedowns a 30yearold looks 
50 and few of the children wear shoes no one is sure how many 
people live here 
the average traveler thinks heres a gypsy hes happy well 
fed and plays wonderful music but that is only 1 percent of the 
gypsy population said bela osztoikan head of the gypsy 
organization phralipe or brotherhood 
in reality most of them live in poverty and where there is 
poverty there is no culture there is more crime and there is 
darkness 
leaders of eastern europes 6 million gypsies have no praise for 
the former communist regimes which were guilty of forced 
assimilation exploitation and discrimination and little faith in 
a democratic future 
most gypsies are afraid of change which takes them toward 
the unknown said manush romanov of bulgarias democratic union 
of roma one of the two main gypsy branches calls itself roma and 
the other is sinti 
however deep their distrust the new freedom allows gypsies to 
voice their frustrations openly for the first time in decades 
the communist hungarian leaders of the past 45 years stripped 
the gypsies of their own communities forbade them to practice the 
trades of their ancestors spoke disparagingly of their language 
and culture gypsy author jozsef choli daroczi said recently 
in hungary and elsewhere the communists preached equality in an 
attempt to paper over centuries of prejudice that culminated in the 
extermination of an estimated 500000 european gypsies by the nazis 
the hatreds did not die prominent in the budapest graffiti of 
the 1980s was oac for oeld a ciganyt which means kill the 
gypsy 
a 1983 song by the hungarian rock group mosoly contains the vow 
to exterminate all gypsies adults and children 
officials also did their part in czechoslovakia jozef prokop 
of the government commission for the problems of the gypsy 
populance said a few years ago that 20 percent of gypsy newborns 
were mentally retarded 
he expressed horror at a birth rate of 7000 a year in an 
estimated gypsy population of 600000 and advocated enforced birth 
control prokop also recommended alternative methods of raising 
gypsy children for example in foster homes special boarding 
schools and the like 
gypsies say bulgaria responded to a perceived danger of gypsy 
overpopulation with a 30year assimilation campaign that began in 
the 1950s and included forced name changes 
by the 1960s at the latest everything had been forbidden that 
had anything to do with gypsyhood romanov said he described 
attempts to destroy gypsy traditions and language as cultural and 
ethnic genocide 
less forced assimilation occurred in poland and romania but 
gypsies there were pressured into giving up traditional ways in the 
name of equality 
despite their numbers an estimated 3 million in romania alone 
gypsies became an ethnic nonentity and others made the decisions 
relating to them 
what special status they were given was negative in hungary 
television programs dealing with crime showed photographs of 
juvenile offenders only if they were gypsies 
after trying to erase the old traditions communist authorities 
across east europe offered no real way for gypsies to integrate 
and left them generally with poor schooling substandard housing 
and little medical care 
such neglect produced an army of gypsy school dropouts that 
became a source of cheap unskilled labor for stateowned 
enterprises 
gypsies now stand to suffer most from the double squeeze of 
companies closing or laying off thousands of employees and 
costconscious governments cutting back on social programs 
in a capitalist system there will be no further need for the 
great masses of the gypsy people qualified only for menial tasks 
phralipe said in its founding declaration last year they will be 
pushed to the edge of society 
beggars and black marketeers have reappeared in european 
capitals many are gypsies 
east europeans share the perception that much of the increase in 
crime is attributable to gypsies 
such developments have given new life to old beliefs that 
gypsies are thieves and loafers 
they are all accusing us of murderous crimes said a 
30yearold gypsy from giurgiu in southern romania 
antigypsy feeling has led to violence unthinkable under 
communist regimes where rowdies had more fear of police in 
prague czechoslovakia roving bands of skinheads have attacked 
gypsies 
weve had so many promises that were tired of them said 
ilona bango 30 joining companions in reciting a long list of 
wrongs let action replace words

the huddled masses it turns out werent 
particularly tired or poor or tempesttost they were the 
wretched refuse of nobodys shore and instead of dissolving into a 
melting pot they formed a lumpy stew of old world languages foods 
and customs 
such are the lessons of the ellis island immigration museum 
which opens to the public monday on the island through which 12 
million immigrants passed between 1892 and 1954 
the new museum housed in the renovated victorian immigration 
station building is dedicated to refuting and rewriting a variety 
of persistent myths about immigration in general and the island in 
particular 
visitors might be surprised to learn 
the only people who were given new names on ellis island were 
the young women who got married there 
a greater proportion of wouldbe immigrants were barred from 
america at european ports about 5 percent than at ellis 2 
percent 
most who passed through ellis ferried on to new jersey the 
gateway to the rest of america not new york city 
although 30 million people came to america in this century 10 
million moved out 
the myth the museum most thoroughly deconstructs is that of the 
uprooted immigrant a pathetic ragged creature blindly fleeing 
tyranny plague or famine 
these were not destitute people said diana pardue 
supervisor of curators the really poor did not come over they 
couldnt afford the passage or they didnt have the 25 you needed 
to clear immigration here 
most of those who did come she added were middle or 
lowermiddle class they were looking for a better lifestyle or a 
chance to be educated or to buy land 
they had tasted freedom and prosperity in europe wanted more 
and so set out for the worlds emerging agricultural and industrial 
power 
i dont think the myth of misery and degradation helps at 
all sen daniel patrick moynihan has written in particular 
it doesnt help explain the strengthening of american democracy in 
the age of immigration 
the museum helps refurbish the immigrants image by displaying 
their middleclass trappings a teddy bear carried by a girl from 
switzerland an early german box camera a silver pocket watch from 
france 
oral histories fill in the picture the mother of michael 
dukakis for instance recalls coming here not because of hunger or 
war but because women in her native greece could not go to college 
if the immigrants were not so wretched neither were the 
conditions under which most of them traveled pardue admits that 
steerage the least expensive steamship passenger class could be 
unpleasant but she likens it to tourist class on an airline 
today immigrants paid a rate like the supersaver fare 
the museum also stresses the immigrants attempts to retain 
rather than reject their ethnic identity 
the old theory is the melting pot where immigrants were 
immediately assimilated said pardue now we believe that the 
immigrants pretty much maintained their ethnicity and settled in 
groups of their own 
although ellis welcomed its share of the famous irving berlin 
and bob hope passed through in their early years the new museum 
emphasizes the experience of ordinary people 
unlike the immigration museum in the base of the statue of 
liberty which stresses the contributions of rich men like andrew 
carnegie and joseph pulitzer there are no famous immigrants in 
this museum said phyllis montgomery a staffer at a firm that 
helped create the exhibits 
the museum also will dispel one particularly durable legend 
that ellis immigration clerks shortened and otherwise 
americanized unwieldy european names 
national park service researchers encountered only one immigrant 
who claimed to have been renamed at ellis and she could provide no 
documentation 
whats more there was no legal way names could have been 
changed here said pardue even if a clerk mispronounced 
someones name it was never written down 
some immigrants names were changed involuntarily but probably 
by other culprits suspects include steamship company clerks in 
europe who compiled the passenger lists on which ellis immigration 
officials relied 
to a clerk in the german port of bremen some polish names 
might be incomprehensible said gary roth an exhibit designer 
some changed their names by taking marriage vows the 
immigration service would not allow unescorted single young women 
including mailorder brides to leave the island so the knot was 
tied in the islands chapel 
in many cases historians believe newcomers simply changed 
their own names to better fit in with their new surroundings 
finally the museum aims to give ellis island itself a new 
image according to pardue the isle of tears wasnt so sad 
most people think it was a drab awful place but it wasnt all 
doom and gloom 
the island was breezy in summer and commanded a fine view of 
lower manhattan and new york harbor it had playgrounds for 
children who years later still recalled the man with the cart who 
handed out milk and cookies 
the few immigrants who were detained enjoyed three meals a day 
gardens tennis courts and concerts one said she heard caruso sing 
there some got their first look at an electric light others 
their first taste of white bread 
many people were in awe of the place said pardue in some 
ways it was a sort of miniresort

thirty years ago the joke 
circulating mgm studio went like this 
too bad about ann miller 
why what happened to her 
she fell down and broke her hair 
the sophisticates used to deride miller with her laquered hair 
powdered face and sunshiny verve but most of her detractors are 
dead or at the motion picture country house and miller goes on 
the gams are great and the toes can still tap a mile a minute 
she remains a hollywood landmark at age well its best to let 
her tell it 
my story is kind of weird she says i was discovered 
dancing up at bal tabarin a theaterrestaurant in san francisco 
when i was not quite 13 years old i was very tall and i had 
eyelashes and long fingernails the whole thing lucille ball and 
vaudeville and radio comic benny rubin saw me dancing one night 
that was when eleanor powell was at her height 
rko was looking for another dancer and lucy and benny saw me 
doing this little machinegun tap thing they asked me if id like 
to take a test at rko of course my mother and i just jumped at 
the chance they asked me how old i was and i said 18 television and 
on 
broadway in mame she teamed with mickey rooney in a hokey 
revue sugar babies that lasted 8 years in new york on the 
road and london it made both stars rich 
sugar babies brought me the financial freedom that i 
needed miller reflected and it brought me the stardom that i 
needed at mgm i always played the second feminine lead i was 
never the star in films i was the brassy goodhearted showgirl i 
never really had my big moment on the screen 
sugar babies and mame gave me the stardom that my soul 
kind of yearned for

when director fritz lang fled nazi germany in 
1933 he gazed out the dining car of his train and brushed the hair 
out of his eyes the wind sweeping across his face he then watched 
the tracks join together split in two and join together again 
at least thats how howard rodman imagines it he also imagines 
a meeting between lang and nazi propaganda chief joseph goebbels 
theyre sitting in goebbels office parallelograms of light 
shining on a dusty parquet floor as the propaganda minster speaks 
lang stares at a large municipal clock outside a ray of sunlight 
inching towards his shoe 
destiny express 1795 atheneum is rodmans first 
published novel the writing clean and welllighted it was 
inspired appropriately by one of langs movies during an 
afternoon in 1982 when rodman took time off from his job as a union 
organizer in manhattan and sat through the directors classic 
thriller the testament of dr mabuse 
rodman who always loved film noir of the 1940s and 50s said 
the lang film was one of those movies that changes your life 
part of it was realizing how much of contemporary films from 
star wars stuff to indiana jones come right out of this 
particular film he said part of it was the joy of watching 
somebody inventing the language of filmmaking right before your 
eyes how you tell a story through shots and narratives was 
something that he along with other people devised and i watched 
that happening 
lang was one of germanys most celebrated directors until the 
nazis came to power and rodman who had completed a novel about 
sex drugs and politics in new york tracked down his other 
films metropolis and m among them he also read books and 
contemporary reviews 
rodman considered an essay about langs films but instead was 
drawn to dramatizing the director especially the artistic 
collaboration with his wife thea von harbou who remained in 
germany and eventually became a nazi 
its pretty clear that their partnership was equal said 
rodman who has written for the magazines premiere and american 
film but the real kicker was how they each thought of those 
films 
he looked back at all the films he made prior to leaving 
germany as the films that of course were the films that someone 
when confronted with nazism would have to be repelled by it would 
have to escape it would leave behind your career your language 
everything 
she saw the exact same films as the absolute natural 
precursors of what the nazi party was doing she saw metropolis 
as leading everything inevitably and joyfully to the ascension to 
power of hitler i wanted to know how two people could be so 
incredibly intimate as collaborators and yet have widely different 
world views 
destiny express named after langs 1921 film destiny 
takes place during the directors last days in germany thea is 
having an affair with an american surrealist fellow artists 
bertolt brecht billy wilder and max ophuls are leaving the 
country and goebbels has offered lang the chance to make 
propaganda films 
this is rodmans equivalent to motivational light a novel so 
visual that shadows seem to streak across the page and the words 
stand out like individual frames 
alone in the corrider he scraped a wood match against the 
wall lighting a cigarette rodman writes 
langs feet like his hands were quite large and he walked 
with an erect military carriage he had been out here for most of 
the film extinguishing coarse imported cigarettes on the floor 
and watching the play of his distinctly multiple shadows the 
shadows elongated and foreshortened as he paced the hallway 
lang adjusted his monocle and idly lit one more match 
i didnt know what the characters faces would look like or 
what they were going to say unless i knew what the light was in the 
room rodman said im not in real life usually a glum sort of 
custard but i wanted that sense of the world closing in 
i think it is true that what lang is thinking is a world in 
which the camera the car the airplane all are used for 
purposes for genocide and not longer after the events of this 
book 
adapting destiny express to film seemed obvious and rodmans 
agent is working on a deal in which the movie would be shot in 
europe using englishspeaking actors all rodman had to do was 
prepare a treatment a process painful enough to give him 
nightmares about parallelograms of light 
it was the hardest thing i ever had to write he said i 
had to turn the book inside out in order to do it find some 
external equivalent for every literary thing in this book the 
writing was deceptively cinematic you had to reinvent it from the 
details i did it but i never will again

country music singer holly dunn offers 
these reasons why she recently had nine straight top 10 hits it 
was a miracle divine guidance 
it was the kind of explanation youd expect to hear from the 
daughter of a minister dun also has less heavenly ideas why her 
music is played so often on the nations 2100 country music radio 
stations 
i hope its because our music is good and has integrity she 
said we dont put something out just to be putting it out we 
labor over the writing the producing and the singing 
dunns versatility hard work and clean living have made her one 
of country musics steadiest and most popular performers during the 
past four years 
her poignant 1986 hit daddys hands is destined to become 
a country music classic since then she has won the country music 
associations horizon award as the most promising newcomer and she 
has affirmed that honor with no 1 country hits such as are you 
ever gonna love me only when i love and love someone like 
me 
she teamed with michael martin murphey on the duet a face in 
the crowd which earned them a grammy nomination she also 
recorded the duet maybe with kenny rogers and has sung on 
albums with dolly parton and emmylou harris 
last october she became the 64th regular cast member of the 
grand ole opry 
dunn 33 was born and raised in san antonio texas she has 
created her niche like many other country stars singing about love 
and family but she offers much more 
im a little unique in a lot of ways she said during an 
interview in her publicists music row office 
im the only one as far as i know on the female side who 
writes produces and sings the material i think this gives me a 
real legitimacy a genuineness im not just up there standing 
where they tell me to stand singing what they tell me to sing 
i feel what i do i think theres a sensitivity in a lot of 
my music a lot of me in there i think people appreciate that 
this is what i try for anyway 
she wrote daddys hands a touching tune about a childs 
memories of her father as a fathers day gift to her dad a church 
of christ minister in san antonio it found its way onto record and 
into country music lore 
its become one of the most requested songs in country music 
of all time dunn said its right up there with forever and 
ever amen and all those standards 
some people believe it may follow the pattern of wind beneath 
my wings which was a country hit by gary morris and crossed over 
to the pop charts years later to become a hit for bette midler 
dunn isnt sure 
its so country the melody the feel all of it i dont 
know how anybody would change that but it would be fine with me if 
they want to try she said 
what really surprised me is someone hasnt picked it up for a 
greeting card commercial or something ive had it pitched to 
several companies because its such a natural it would be a 
perfect fathers day ad 
daddys hands her best known record came early in her 
career 
i guess its kind of strange to have it happen so quickly 
dunn said in a way it created sort of a false energy we had to 
level off somewhere and now weve kicked back in we had such a 
big surge because of that one song 
she has been in nashville since graduation from abilene 
christian university in the country music capital she worked as a 
clerk in a bookstore and then as a travel agent before becoming a 
fulltime performer 
she worked as a staff songwriter for four years before signing 
with mtm records to pursue a singing career when mtm folded she 
quickly signed with warner bros 
along the way she sang most of all why with parton harris 
was guest vocalist on dunns cornerstone lp then there was 
work with rogers whom she describes as one of the nicest people in 
music 
he thanked me for helping his career and im sure i didnt 
thats the kind of person he is very generous she said i 
also got to work the road with him some and that fulfilled some 
fantasies of mine

anyone who has seen pictures of military 
equipment assembled in the mideast or who observes the millions of 
automobiles on us roads knows immediately that america can still 
manufacture 
despite this visual evidence stories abound about the decline 
of american manufacturing about the abandonment of still another 
plant about the socalled deindustrialization of the nation 
modern mythology snaps murrary weidenbaum american 
manufacturing not only is well he says but has improved in 
several ways that bode well for the future 
he observes that the decline that led to a rash of doomsday 
books articles and extremist forecasts ended nearly a decade ago 
as often happens however the belief lingers erroneous though it 
might be there is some say a vested interest in the myth 
research books consultancies academic grants 
but says weidenbaum the manufacturing sector today 
contributes just about the same proportion of the total output of 
the american economy as it did three decades ago and in that 
period the economy grew more than four times 
weidenbaum has a longtime involvement with issues of industrial 
myth vs fact having been chairman of the council of economic 
advisers in the reagan administration and since then as director 
of the center for the study of american business a think tank 
based at washington university in st louis 
contrary to the doomandgloomers he says the longest us 
peacetime expansion didnt bypass the industrial sector by 
yearend 1988 he points out industrial production was 40 percent 
above the 1982 low perhaps of even greater importance that rate 
was 24 percent above the previous cyclical high 
now he states three key forces are at work which strongly 
suggest the industrial sector will continue strong in the 1990s 
american companies have been reducing the cost of producing 
goods and services 
in 1980 the average privatesector worker received a 9 percent 
wage boost by mid1989 the rate was half that for all 1988 the 
number of work stoppages involving 1000 or more employees was 43 
compared to 300 a decade earlier 
workers and managers are showing a new awareness of their 
personal responsibility for quality 
at some manufacturers weidenbaum states employees receive as 
much as 40 hours of training in quality measurements and 
responsibility for quality control is gradually moving from 
inspectors to workers themselves 
private investment in research and development continues to 
grow 
for the first time since data was assembled business rampd 
outlays in the 1980s exceeded government spending by 445 billion 
to 430 billion the number of rampd scientists and engineers grew to 
595000 in 1987 from 469000 in 1980 
these three factors have made a difference and will continue to 
do so says weidenbaum 
from 1973 to 1981 he points out domestic manufacturers 
increased productivity by only 15 percent a year but from 1981 to 
1988 the average more than doubled to 38 percent higher even than 
in the period 19481973 
in short says weidenbaum the american manufacturing sector is 
stronger today than it was a decade or so ago in spite of the 
persistent declaration by public officials academics and others 
that it is in decline 
weidenbaum believes american competetiveness will continue 
strong assuming the country doesnt adopt counterproductive public 
policies 
protectionism would be one such policy a spate of social 
mandates higher minimum wages compulsory health insurance 
parental leave that raise the cost of doing business would be 
another 
in contrast he says a reduction of federal budget deficits 
through spending cuts especially if the cuts focus on consumption 
could lead to additional improvements in the manufacturing sector 
he concludes enhancing the competitiveness of american 
industry is not fundamentally a question of how to get government 
to do more for manufacturing but how to get it to do less to 
manufacturing

as the trademark piano received a final 
tuning sales help scurried around the new nordstrom inc 
department store unpacking the remaining boxes rearranging clothes 
racks and getting to know the inventory 
the opening of the nordstrom store at the garden state plaza 
shopping mall in paramus nj marks the retailers first foray 
into the fiercely competitive northeast 
the official debut occurs friday when the 245000squarefoot 
store opens for business members of the media were given a preview 
tour of the store tuesday 
operating in this area might pose the biggest challenge yet for 
the west coast chain that has been migrating eastward as part of an 
ambitious expansion 
a struggling regional economy has shaken consumer confidence and 
crimped spending crisis in the middle east could further curb 
retail spending as the critical holiday season approaches 
nonetheless nordstrom executives seem optimistic about entering 
the market and private analysts say the retailer stands a good 
chance to thrive here 
its serviceoriented brand of retailing combined with broad 
assortments of reliable quality merchandise will give it an edge 
over rivals with less favorable reputations analysts say 
i think its probably one of the best if not the best 
department stores in the country said carl steidtmann chief 
economist at management horizons the retail management and market 
research division of the accounting firm price waterhouse the 
fact that the competition is in such a state of disarray might make 
it a good time to go into the northeast 
richard pyle a retail analyst at piper jaffray amp hopwood inc 
said nordstrom which focuses on womens mens and childrens 
fashions shoes and accessories is in far better financial shape 
than its competitors 
some department stores such as macys which is a nordstrom 
neighbor at the garden state plaza are courting customers 
aggressively to boost business and pay off debts others such as 
saks fith avenue are adjusting to life under new owners who are 
closely monitoring bottom lines 
the 61store nordstrom chain dates back to 1901 when swedish 
immigrant john w nordstrom founded a seattle shoe shop with money 
made mining gold in alaska nordstrom still emphasizes shoes the 
paramus store boasts an inventory of some 70000 ladies shoes and 
30000 mens 
the chain has historically prided itself on topnotch service 
and stories abound about its sales associates going to unusual 
lengths to please people nordies have been known to personally 
deliver merchandise to customers homes and to write thankyou 
notes to customers typically on their own time 
the legendary service has been a key to landing customers in new 
markets 
as elsewhere the paramus store employs personal shoppers who 
will help customers select apparel assemble outfits and 
accessorize a concierge stationed near the entrance will steer 
customers in the right direction and handle special requests 
shoppers have three restaurants to choose from on the stores three 
levels and a spa offering massages facials manicures pedicures 
and waxing 
james f nordstrom one of three descendents of the founder who 
currently bear the title cochairman said shoppers appreciate 
being treated well no matter what part of the country they live in 
apart from minor adjustments in merchandise mix he said there have 
been no special adaptations made in bringing the seattlebased 
retailer east 
the chain already operates two stores in the virginia suburbs of 
washington and intends to open two more in new jersey over the next 
two years plus one in new york in 1993 its growth strategy calls 
for about four openings a year 
we just think customers like a lot of selection good quality 
and to be treated nicely he said in a telephone interview from 
the companys headquarters 
one blot on the nordstrom name appeared earlier this year when 
the washington state department of labor and industries acting 
after a union complaint ruled that the company has failed to pay 
employees for some of the extras they provide the agency ordered 
nordstrom to properly compensate employees for work and to pay back 
wages 
industry analysts say nordstrom has weathered the bad publicity 
without much damage to its reputation a 15 million reserve the 
company set aside to pay back wage claims should be adequate 
james nordstrom said the labor problems which have been 
confined mostly to the seattle area havent impaired the 
retailers results 
many employees have proven their commitment to the company he 
said by paying their own way to transfer to new stores the 
paramus store will have about 100 sales associates who have 
previously worked elsewhere for nordstrom an additional 100 
managers were transferred by the company which has a policy of 
promoting from within about 900 employees overall will work at the 
garden state plaza store 
nordstroms sales and profits havent been as impressive lately 
as they had been in the recent past earnings slid 20 percent in 
the first half of this year to 49 million on sales of 136 
billion that deterioration came after a 7 percent income drop last 
year to 115 million despite a 147 percent sales gain to 27 
billion 
nordstrom also has felt the pinch of the currently sluggish 
retail climate cochairman nordstrom said its fair to say that 
our planned increase in sales is greater than the increase were 
experiencing 
he said the retailer is taking a conservative approach to the 
coming season and will tighten inventory slightly 
if business doesnt measure up chainwide for a prolonged period 
nordstrom may scale back its expansion plans were not going to 
leverage ourselves and grow for growth sake nordstrom said 
noting that some openings may be delayed if necessary 
at the paramus store retail analysts say the company is hoping 
sales will exceed 100 million in the first year nordstrom 
executives declined to disclose projections

this western wisconsin community in 
many ways the center of the dairy industry is the first 
battleground over proposed changes in the governments decadesold 
milk pricing system 
it hosts the first hearing today in a rare us department of 
agriculture investigation into whether the federal milk marketing 
system should be altered to eliminate price disparities from one 
region to another 
the formula partially pays farmers based on how far they live 
from eau claire a city of about 50000 located 120 miles east of 
minneapolis in the heart of wisconsins dairy farm region 
dairy farmers close to eau claire argue the milkpricing system 
is unfair outdated and provides artificially high subsidies for 
producers in the south and west who live farthest from here 
the milk marketing order system created in the 1930s is 
designed to insure an adequate supply of milk move milk from 
highproduction areas and stabilize the market said bob cropp a 
dairy marketing specialist at the university of wisconsinmadison 
but while milk production in the south and west traditionally 
nondairy producing states that have received higher prices for 
their milk has increased markedly the current system continues 
to pay farmers in those regions more than the midwest cropp said 
i dont mind competing against farmers from the south and west 
as long as we are competing by the same rules said wisconsin 
dairy farmer pete knigge the chairman of the national commission 
on agriculture and rural development policy 
officials expect the hearings to manifest the strong regional 
splits over the issue 
certainly there is a great divergence of opinion among 
producers in various parts of the country on changes needed in the 
order program said jim barr chief executive officer of the 
national milk producers federation in virginia 
the federation represents about 100000 dairy farmers who 
produce 70 percent of the nations milk barr said the groups 
membership is about evenly split over whether the current system 
should be changed he said 
an administrative law judge will conduct the agriculture 
department hearings which will explore about 60 different 
proposals to alter the system us rep steven gunderson rwis 
said 
the administrative law judge will make recommendations to us 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who observers predict will 
take two to three years to institute changes 
three days of testimony are planned in eau claire the remaining 
hearings will be sept 1019 in minneapolis sept 20 in st cloud 
minn oct 15 in syracuse ny oct 1012 in tallahassee fla 
and oct 15 in dallas 
the present system includes a transportation factor in 
determining what farmers are paid for milk the farther a farmer 
lives from eau claire the more the producer receives 
while wisconsin remains the no 1 milk producing state with 
about 175 percent of the nations milk supply a title it has 
held for the last century california has moved into second place 
with a 13percent share of the market 
eau claire became the measuring spot for the transportation 
differential in 1961 because the bulk of us was produced in 
wisconsin and minnesota and eau claire was center of that 
production 
when you look at the kind of increases in production in the 
south and west there simply is no rhyme or reason for providing 
incentives based on how far you live away from eau claire 
gunderson said 
for example in june a wisconsin dairy farmer on the average 
earned 1420 for every eight gallons of milk he produced based on 
the federal milk orders barr said 
the same farmer in florida got 1730

its getting a little easier to get into one of 
businesss more exclusive clubs 
two new york stock exchange seats in the past two months have 
each sold for 301000 each the lowest level in more than 5 years 
prices of seats which entitle members to trade directly on the 
stock exchange floor tend to reflect the level of trading volume 
on the nyse the nations largest stock exchange 
the latest sale on tuesday matched the price paid on aug 23 
continues a decline that has driven down prices from the alltime 
high of 115 million in september 1987 a month before the stock 
market crashed 
a seat last sold for 300000 on dec 17 1984 
brokerage firms in the last year have reduced personnel and 
operations individual investors have shied away from stocks and 
commission rates have fallen reducing the desirability of owning 
a seat less trading means lower commissions and less revenue for 
brokerage firms 
the price of an nyse membership has fallen steadily since the 
1987 market crash after a steady rise that took seats from a low of 
35000 in 1977 to 105000 in 1978 425000 in 1983 and 600000 
in 1986 
the high seat price this year was 430000 on june 7 according 
to stock exchange records there have been 24 seat sales so far in 
1990 including seven in august compared with 26 in all of 1989 
the most recent seat sales have been 370000 on july 17 
330000 on aug 3 325000 on aug 14 320000 on aug 15 
310000 on aug 20 301000 on aug 23 309000 on aug 28 and 
305000 on aug 31 
following the latest sale the quoted price for a seat was 
350000 with a bid of 280000 the quoted price is the asking 
price and the bid is what a buyer is willing to pay 
seat prices also have fallen at the american stock exchange to 
10year lows but the sharp rise in oil prices since iraq seized 
kuwait last month has driven up seats on the new york mercantile 
exchange where oil futures are traded 
the seat system dates to 1868 when stock exchange membership 
was made saleable before that each member had a lifetime seat 
reserved in one place 
physically there havent been seats on the floor for years and 
the name dates to a time when brokers literally sat around trading 
a roster of stocks the number of seats has been limited to 1366 
since 1953

troubled loans for real estate and leveraged 
buyouts are adding to the burdens of the nations biggest banks 
moodys investors service inc said 
the problems are hindering the banks recoveries from past 
mistakes in lending to developing nations the credit rating agency 
said 
in a pessimistic annual review moodys said tuesday the 1990s 
may be the decade in which some powerful regional institutions 
challenge the supremacy of the nationwide moneycenter banks 
while the creditworthiness of most of the nine moneycenter 
banks has steadily declined since the 1970s problems have 
accelerated in recent years with credit rating reductions 
moodys said in a 37page report that major trouble spots for 
banks are 55 billion in commercial real estate loans inadequate 
reserves to cover nonperforming loans to developing countries and a 
large exposure to buyouts and other highrisk transactions 
the nine money center banks are bankamerica corp bankers trust 
new york corp chase manhattan corp chemical bank corp 
citicorp continental bank corp first chicago corp 
manufacturers hanover corp and jp morgan amp co 
the report said that all the money centers except jp morgan 
and bankers trust are undercapitalized because of the sharp 
deterioration in domestic asset quality and low domestic reserves 
moodys said it was not clear the banks could rebuild capital 
quickly enough to absorb additional provisions against domestic and 
developing country loans which might be required 
the report mentioned security pacific corp of los angeles 
wells fargo amp co of san francisco ncnb corp of charlotte nc 
and banc one corp of columbus ohio as key superregionals for 
the 1990s 
the most recent round of creditrating downgrades affecting 
citicorp and other giants were prompted by the real estate slump 
and moodys offered no promises that further downgrades could be 
avoided 
moodys said vacancy rates remain high in big cities which 
appear to be overbuilt and that construction loans of all types 
are potentially troublesome particularly for hotels and strip 
shopping centers 
market psychology has deteriorated as the savings and loan 
scandal has forced many regional and moneycenter banks to reduce 
new real estate lending that has put developers under pressure and 
made existing properties tough to sell moodys said 
the credit agency listed texas arizona new england oklahoma 
tennessee and colorado as highly distressed markets it said 
significant risk elements exist in new jersey georgia 
maryland virginia pennsylvania california new york and florida 
chemical bank had the largest percentage of nonperforming 
commercial real estate loans on which no interest is being paid 
at 155 percent followed by citicorp at 139 percent and first 
chicago at 126 percent jp morgan had by far the lowest rate 
04 percent 
overall 114 percent of the banks 549 billion in commercial 
real estate loans outstanding in march were described as 
nonperforming the report said 
moodys also said banks still need to increase their reserves 
to account for a larger slice of outstanding loans to latin 
american countries 
moodys said average coverage by banks increased to 50 percent 
in the first quarter of 1990 from 37 percent in 1988 but the level 
remains below the 75 percent to 100 percent established by most 
regional and international banks 
further clouding the future of national banks is exposure to 
highrisk transactions mostly leveraged buyouts initiated in the 
mid to late 1980s in a leveraged buyout an investor or investors 
borrow a large amount of money to purchase a corporation and then 
sell assets to make interest payments 
moodys said the nations moneycenter banks had 54 billion in 
exposure to highly leveraged transaction at the end of 1989 up 
from 32 billion in 1988 in part because of a broader regulatory 
definition 
but the report pegged hlt exposure as a major coming problem 
area with nonperforming assets expected to rise substantially 
compounding the problems is the collapse of the junk bond market 
which was envisioned as a place to refinance some leveraged buyouts 
problem borrowers may go bankrupt resulting in a lengthy 
workout process before the banks can recover their principal 
moodys said 
in several instances asset sales have fetched prices below 
expectations the report said as a consequence those lbo 
structures that rely upon asset sales or refinancing to meet 
maturing principal may encounter difficulty in the next few 
years

the international monetary fund which has 
prescribed financial austerity and freemarket capitalism for 
countries from mexico to mozambique may be about to issue the same 
prescription to the capital of world communism 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday that an 
imfled study of the soviet economy will be on the agenda when 
president bush meets with soviet president mikhail gorbachev in 
helsinki finland on sunday 
industrialized nations meeting at the economic summit in houston 
in july ordered the imf and three other international financial 
institutions to study the soviet unions needs and the 
opportunities for western help 
president bush will be interested in the progress that has 
been made in that assessment and president gorbachevs views of 
the reform effort fitzwater said 
the imf founded in a new hampshire village 46 years ago to 
stabilize the exchange of money among nations is coordinating the 
study also taking part are the washingtonbased world bank which 
makes loans for projects in third world countries the parisbased 
organization for economic cooperation and development and the 
newly formed european bank for reconstruction and development 
graham newman deputy chief of the imf information office said 
a team representing the four organizations has been in the soviet 
union conducting interviews and collecting data for the study 
which is due to be completed by the end of the year 
newman said the imf will not have a representative in helsinki 
but it could well be that the team will submit to the president 
a memo on its progress 
of the four agencies the imf is perhaps the most controversial 
partly because of policies that its critics say have imposed 
stringent economic rules on developing nations to the detriment of 
the poor 
the standard prescription for countries suffering from 
inflation to get an imf loan is dismissal of workers from public 
employment deflation of the currency and removal of subsidies on 
basic staples said laurence birns president of the council on 
hemispheric affairs there is no question that the group that 
bears the heaviest burden in these restructuring efforts are the 
poor and the rural middle class 
imf spokesman newman conceded that in any economy when 
adjustments need to be made there are some shortterm problems 
but newman said the fund encourages the countries to develop a 
safety net to protect the most disadvantaged 
i suppose one has to look at the alternatives newman said 
if countries do not put their economies back in order again 
things are only going to go from bad to worse and the poor are 
going to suffer even more 
in addition to barbs from liberals such as birns and his group 
the imf has faced opposition from economic conservatives 
i think the problem is that they have essentially become a 
dole said doug bandow a senior fellow at the cato institute 
we have seen throughout latin america that as a practical matter 
countries will get money year after year even if they dont live up 
to their conditions 
newman took issue saying if performance criteria have not 
been attained and a country wants to continue with the program 
that triggers an automatic consultation to find out what went wrong 
and why it went wrong he said imf loans have been stopped in 
many many cases 
bandow also argued that imf conditions encourage countries to 
adopt protectionist measures which hurt their economies and to 
raise taxes rather than reduce spending to curb budget deficits 
my guess is that the study of the soviet economy may not be 
a bad thing bandow said the problem is that the policy of the 
imf suggests that whatever the study is the outcome isnt going to 
be terribly helpful 
the fivemonth deadline for the soviet study came as a shock to 
some in organizations accustomed to more leisurely studies 
we did a study of the chinese economy many years ago said 
peter riddleberger press manager for the world bank it took 
several years of course 
hernan puentes a chilean economist who is riddlebergers 
counterpart at the imf said i tell you people are scared to 
death of being asked to do it in five months its going to mean 
sleepless nights for a lot of people

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca is telling 
his executives to cut the budget again 
for the second time since june 1989 chrysler has boosted its 
target for costcutting this time to 25 billion by the end of 
june it had been 15 billion by the end of this year which in 
turn was up from the original 1 billion 
chryslers costcutting program comes as its profits and sales 
sink 
iacocca disclosed the latest target in an interview in tuesdays 
editions of the wall street journal spokesman steve harris said 
the means for removing the additional expenditures havent been 
worked out yet 
some tentative targets were being talked about harris said 
tuesday we havent formalized that yet or put the program in 
place that is a tentative target that he iacocca is looking at 
harris said productdevelopment plans would be exempt from any 
new round of cuts 
anything having to do with the product or customer 
satisfaction is intact he said 
industry observers generally agree that chrysler badly needs to 
introduce a new midsize sedan as soon as possible to freshen its 
lineup the next such car is codenamed lh and is due in 
dealerships in late 1992 as a 1993 model 
also on tuesday chrysler tacked seven months onto the life of 
its st louis car plant which employs about 2300 workers 
chrysler had initially planned to close the plant sept 21 then 
delayed it until nov 9 
company spokesman alan miller said the factory now is due to 
close may 24 at the end of production for the 1991model dodge 
daytona and chrysler lebaron coupe and convertible cars daytona 
production will be moved to sterling heights mich and lebaron 
production is to transfer to newark del 
chryslers sales this year have been slumping through the first 
seven months of 1990 the company sold about 104 million cars and 
light trucks down 155 percent from last year 
iacocca said in the journal interview that the cost cutting 
prevented chrysler from going into the red during the first half of 
this year the company made 251 million during the first six 
months of 1990 64 percent less than it made during the same period 
last year 
part of the reason for the decline in profits has been 
chryslers continued heavy use of incentives to prop up sales 
company officials have said incentives cost chrysler more than 
1000 for every vehicle sold 
wall street analysts and chrysler executives expect the company 
will lose a substantial amount of money in the third quarter 
mainly because of production interruptions at its two profitable 
minivan plants the two factories were shut down for four weeks 
apiece for retooling for 1991 models 
chrysler has eliminated about 2500 of its 28700 whitecollar 
jobs since last october harris said the costcutting program was 
announced in july 1989

texas officials have imposed a distribution embargo on kellogg 
cos heartwise cereal in texas in a dispute over labeling 
on tuesday the texas health department ordered warehouses to 
halt distribution of the cereal it accused kellogg of deceptive 
labeling and of failing to warn consumers about potential allergic 
reactions to psyllium a whole grain touted by kellogg as a 
cholesterol fighter 
texas is the only state that has sought to ban sales of 
heartwise which was introduced last year by the battle creek 
michbased cereal maker and has prompted a federal inquiry into 
the safety of psyllium 
last week kellogg filed a federal lawsuit in dallas against the 
texas health department and the attorney generals office to try to 
ward off the embargo and allow the company to retain its current 
labeling on the product 
for the state of texas to detain heartwise on the basis of 
their belief that its an unapproved drug is totally ridiculous and 
a total disregard for the science behind psyllium kellogg 
spokesman joseph stewart said 
kellogg maintains that psyllium a grain grown mainly in india 
has been scientifically shown to help reduce cholesterol when used 
as part of a complete nutritional diet the soluble fiber is used 
in laxatives and its inclusion in heartwise has led to a 
controversy in the food industry about whether the cereal should be 
considered a drug or food 
the food and drug administration is currently reviewing data on 
psylliums safety and the companys cholesterolfighting claims 
i think this goes back to the labeling of foods with druglike 
claims said dan sowards chief of the food branch for the texas 
department of health the fda has said products that 
continued to make health claims would be subject to scrutiny 
sowards said his department has asked kellogg to change the 
products name and remove heart symbols from the box as well as 
references to hospital endorsements it also has asked for 
inclusion of warnings about potential allergic reactions to 
psyllium 
sowards said data given to the fda by kellogg include at least 
50 cases of allergic reactions to the grain and some of them 
required hospitalization 
kellogg maintains heartwise has been shown to be safe most 
grains including wheat cause allergic reactions in a very small 
percentage of people stewart said 
three independent university studies released in april found 
psyllium to be more effective in fighting cholesterol than wheat or 
oat bran cereals 
stewart said the embargos timing less than a week after the 
lawsuit was filed shows that it is politically motivated and 
not out of any concern for public safety 
he said the company is worried about the controversys affect on 
the cereals sales which have been disappointing 
john mcmillin a food analyst for prudentialbache securities of 
new york said those worries are justified 
this just might be the nail in the coffin for heartwise 
mcmillin said it is my own feeling that the state of texas has 
no business doing this but consumers and the state of texas 
seem to perceive this as a drug and not as a food 
general mills inc pulled its psylliumbased cereal benefit in 
january citing poor sales

boys clothes with an antihunting message 
have been pulled from jc penney co inc store shelves due to 
hunter complaints one of them from michigans largest conservation 
and sportsmens group 
duncan muir public relations manager for the dallasbased 
retailer said the decision was made tuesday after complaints from 
across the nation 
it is our company policy not to take a position one way or the 
other on these sorts of issues this is taking a position and an 
anti position he said 
obviously this was pointed out to us and frankly we feel 
weve made a mistake all we can do is just withdraw it from the 
stores he said 
michigans largest conservation and sportsmens group michigan 
united conservation clubs took aim at penney on friday 
conservation clubs executive director thomas washington said the 
clothes were a slap in the face to michigans million hunters he 
said the clothings message that anyone who enjoys hunting is 
somehow dangerous and evil is simply outrageous 
a card attached to each shirt in the clothing line shows a 
sketch of a bird hunter aiming a shotgun over which a large red 
x has been marked under that are the words absolutely no 
hunting of wild and free animals while wearing this garment 
a similar message is stitched into an inside panel of the 
garment 
pants have a larger card with the message wild life protected 
by man surround the world with pure thoughts tags in the clothes 
indicate it was made in hong kong 
penney bought the environmental protection department line 
of clothing from a new york company h cotler co 
the head of the company howard cotler was in a meeting tuesday 
and didnt return telephone calls seeking comment 
in a letter to the national rifle association last week cotler 
said the antihunting message was a marketing tool that had been 
discontinued 
he wrote that his company neither condemns nor supports 
antigun or antihunting legislation and it was trying to appeal 
to the environmental awareness of young people 
muir said he didnt know how many pieces of clothing were being 
taken off penney store shelves its in various stages of 
shipment a lot of it is still on its way and stores order on their 
own so its hard to say how many pieces are out there 
he declined to place a dollar figure on the penney order to 
cotler saying that was an internal inventory matter muir also 
said the retailer hadnt decided what to do with the clothes 
penney is the nations largest department store chain with 1330 
stores

speculation that us monetary authorities might ease credit

ibm today announced its next 
generation of mainframe computers as part of a strategy designed to 
ensure the large machines place at the center of corporate 
information systems 
the worlds largest computer company also announced replacement 
models for several lowerlevel computer lines in what the company 
said was its most sweeping announcement in 25 years 
international business machines corp announced 18 new 
computers including a topoftheline model that provides twice 
the power of its current highend model 
the new machines are part of what ibm calls its system390 line 
replacing its current system370 this is only the third mainframe 
system line from ibm since the early 1960s 
the new machines which are called the enterprise system9000 
family range in price from 70480 to 228 million 
ibm says its new topend model will be the most powerful 
computer on the market however this model wont be available 
until the third quarter of 1991 many of the lower level models 
will be available later this year or early next year 
as part of its announcement today ibm also disclosed new ways 
to link various size computers in a network and new operating 
system software for the new computer line 
despite the increasing popularity of smaller computers 
mainframes account for about half of ibms profits when associated 
software and equipment are included that makes acceptance of the 
new models crucial 
the introduction of the new machines which has been rumored for 
more than a year also is important to ibm because its competitors 
are stepping up the pressure 
the major makers of ibmcompatible mainframes hitachi data 
systems corp fujitsu and amdahl corp all are planning major 
upgrades to their machines 
on tuesday fujitsu japans largest computer maker beat ibm to 
the punch it announced a powerful new mainframe that it says is 
the fastest in the world fujitsu officials said the top model in 
their new m1800 series is capable of executing up to 600 million 
instructions per second or mips in scientific calculations 
however the fujitsu machine would not be capable of achieving that 
speed in commercial applications 
analysts say the new topoftheline ibm computer will run at a 
maximum speed of about 230 mips ibms current mostpowerful 
mainframe can handle about 112 mips ibm does not disclose its mips 
ratings of computers 
ibm also said that customers will be able to link eight of the 
next topend models to operate as one machine boosting power 
dramatically 
fujitsus new technology is likely to appear in mainframes 
produced by amdahl a us maker of ibmcompatible mainfames that 
is 45 percent owned by fujitsu 
hitachi and amdahl traditionally undercut ibms prices and 
their share of the us mainframe market has been growing while 
ibms slipped in recent years but ibm still holds about 87 percent 
of the us highend mainframe market according to computer 
intelligence a la jolla calif research firm 
ibm compared the importance of todays announcement to the 1964 
disclosure of its system360 line considered a milestone in the 
computer industry 
the company even rented a special amtrak train to take reporters 
from new york city to the announcement site at its poughkeepsie 
mainframe plant 
mainframes typically are used by large corporations such as 
airlines and insurance companies to hold vast amounts of data such 
as information on millions of customer accounts 
the new ibm machines feature fiberoptic lines to link the 
computers to datastorage devices fiberoptic lines which 
transmit information in beams of laser light can move data to the 
computers processor at about twice the rate of the standard 
electrical lines used on the 3090s ibms current top machines 
helping speed processing 
while the system390 represents a major improvement some 
analysts say it doesnt appear to be the breakthrough they earlier 
expected 
it is not a qualitatively different type of technology the 
3090 is being extended said tom willmott a vice president of 
aberdeen group a bostonbased research firm 
he doesnt think the doubling of processing power will do much 
to improve the operation of database programs that are among the 
most popular uses for highend mainframes 
analysts also expressed concern that some of the new models 
wont be available until the second half of 1991 that lag could 
cause customers to defect to competitiors or postpone orders that 
would have gone to 3090s hurting ibms revenues

a handful of major japanese banks may face a 
downgrading in their credit ratings following the recent dramatic 
fall in the tokyo stock market and amid pressure to improve their 
profitability an international credit rating agency said wednesday 
among the banks put on rating watch by the ratings agency 
ibca are the socalled big five city banks daiichi kangyo bank 
fuji bank mitsubishi bank sanwa bank and sumitomo bank and the 
industrial bank of japan 
these institutions currently carry a aaa rating the highest 
credit rating available 
but ibca noted that their results in recent years have been 
increasingly dominated by the stock market which has declined 
sharply this year that decline coupled with the weakness of the 
japanese yen have brought to an end the virtuous circle whereby 
japanese banks could finance at insignificant costs virtually any 
level of growth the agencys report said 
ibca predicted life for japanese banks is going to be more 
difficult for here on 
the bigfive banks have increased their equity base by more than 
300 percent over the past five years or roughly 40 billion the 
agency said but those gains were possible because japanese 
investors have been willing to put up with minimal dividends 
ibca said oncepliant investors may go on strike as capital 
losses mount 
further ibca noted that japanese banks have been slower than 
their international peers in setting aside reserves to cover 
problem foreign loans and those losses are expected to mount 
but the agency said its overall concerns center on high monetary 
growth and the current international tensions rather than the 
performance of individual banks 
ibca said that other japanese banks also may be put on a ratings 
watch

the government reported a slight deterioration in the condition of 
the us soybean crop 
the share of the soybean crop in good to excellent condition 
slipped to 58 percent last week from 59 percent a week earlier

normal pace leaving the crops unusually vulnerable to an early

agricultural products when president bush meets soviet president

an index measuring changes in helpwanted 
advertising in major us newspapers stayed the same in july and

wednesday 
the business research group said its helpwanted index 
registered 132 in july unchanged from junes reading and down from 
149 in july of last year 
ken goldstein a conference board economist said events in the 
middle east could cause businesses including exporters to put 
some hiring plans on hold prior to iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait the economy and the labor market in particular appeared 
poised for modest improvement he said 
now it is more likely that exporters business investors and 
consumers will put some plans on hold until the economic and 
political situation in the persian gulf becomes more clear 
goldstein said 
for the labor market that probably means no big staff 
expansions over the next few months and little chance of wantad 
volume quickly turning around he said 
parts of the country in which oil plays an economic role could 
experience job gains if the recent spike in oil prices encourages 
growth in oil exploration the board said in a news release 
the conference board based in new york collects information 
for its helpwanted index from 51 big newspapers around the country 
each month ad volume is sensitive to labor market conditions and 
considered to be a gauge of changes in the supply of jobs at the

jury selection began today in what promised to be 
a lengthy and complicated trial of 14 currency traders charged in a 
wideranging probe of corruption in the citys commodities pits 
the defendants all traders of japanese yen futures contracts 
face 393 counts stemming from allegedly illegal trading practices 
at the chicago mercantile exchange 
jury selection began before us district court judge william t 
hart said a clerk in harts chambers who declined to be identified 
by name 
hart has set opening statements for next tuesday in the trial 
which is expected to last four months 
a 15th defendant martin riley jr pleaded no contest during 
pretrial motions tuesday to one count of mail fraud and two counts 
of violating the commodities exchange act said assistant us 
attorney dan gillogly riley a trader in the japanese yen pit 
listed financial and health reasons when entering the plea 
hart accepted the plea conditionally until he reviewed rileys 
financial and health records gillogly said 
the trial is the second major trial stemming from an undercover 
fbi investigation at the merc and the chicago board of trade 
the 14 defendants are accused of violating the commodities 
exchange act by executing trades outside the openoutcry system at 
the futures exchanges 
in all 48 people have been indicted in the probe fbi agents 
posed as traders and secretly tape recorded conversations that 
prosecutors said revealed fraud among traders at the merc and the 
cbot 
in the first trial a federal jury convicted two swiss franc 
traders on relatively minor trading violations a third trader was 
acquitted 
the jury in that trial failed to reach verdicts on scores of 
more serious charges including a racketeering count against one of 
the defendants and mail and wirefraud charges against all three 
the scandal prompted the merc the cbot and their regulators to 
adopt tougher antifraud measures and congress is considering 
regulatory changes to strengthen the markets integrity 
yen trader aric march pleaded guilty aug 24 to two counts of 
mail and commodities fraud as part of a plea agreement the 
government agreed to drop fraud charges against him according to 
court documents the government had accused march of prearranging 
trades of sampp 500 futures with another broker 
march is expected to testify in the other yen traders trial 
six of those traders are charged with racketeering conspiracy 
and all are charged with wire and commodities fraud 
the trial of 12 cbot soybean futures traders is scheduled to 
begin monday before us district judge george marovich 
one soybean trader who was to go on trial before marovich 
pleaded guilty in late august to racketeering and tax fraud the 
trader james d nowak was charged last year with two counts of 
racketeering more than 200 counts of fraud and violations of the 
commodity exchange act

xerox corp on wednesday began offering a 
total satisfaction guarantee that promises a free replacement 
to customers dissatisfied with any of the companys products 
the guarantee covers all xerox products delivered from now on 
for three years or for the full term of financing through xerox 
whichever is longer 
a customer not totally satisfied with a product for whatever 
reason can have it replaced with the same or comparable product 
entirely at xerox expense company officials said at a news 
conference 
we believe this is clearly different from anything thats out 
there today said paul v cahn vice president of reprographics 
and customer service marketing 
the customer is the sole arbiter and decisionmaker with 
virtually every other guarantee or warranty the company decides 
whether a replacement is needed 
david schofield an industry analyst with duff amp phelps in 
chicago said the guarantee might help ease a little buyer 
fear and is probably more psychological than anything else 
i dont know that its going to be a huge boost to sales he 
said i agree with them that it probably wont cost a whole lot 
either 
james j miller xeroxs manager of reprographic product 
marketing said the company does not expect the guarantee to be a 
major expense 
we dont think that were going to get a lot of machines 
back he said 
for the past two years xerox has offered threeyear warranties 
covering repairs on most of its lowvolume consumer products under 
those warranties the company decided whether or not to replace a 
machine cahn said 
the new guarantee supplements existing warranties and applies to 
machines bought rented or leased from xerox or an authorized 
dealer customers must have a xerox service contract 
cahn said xerox expects the guarantee to increase sales in all 
areas the pledge will be extensively advertised over the next few 
weeks he said 
standing behind xerox equipment to the point of replacement is 
good for the customer and its good for xerox he said 
xerox also announced the introduction of two new small copiers

holdings plc for trading securities in the 170 billion private 
placement market 
the announcement follows a recent rule change by the securities 
and exchange commission making it easier for securities firms to 
sell unregistered stocks and bonds to big institutions 
amex said the new electronic marketplace for trading the 
securities is expected to be implemented in the first half of 1991 
and will be called the system for institutional trading of 
unregistered securities of situs 
amex chairman james r jones said in a statement the new system 
would help companies from any country to gain access to a rich 
and largely untapped source of capital liquidity 
the secs new rule 144a exempts us and foreign institutions 
from registration requirements for the sale of stocks and bonds to 
big institutions the market is used largely to sell corporate debt 
the rule was expected to give a boost to the securities industry 
during a slump in trading of stocks and bonds on the public market 
and other business areas but activity there has slumped as well 
us private placement financings fell by one third in the first 
half of 1990 to 553 billion from 821 billion a year earlier 
idd information services said tuesday 
the drop occurred despite the sec rule change and a drying up in 
the junk bond market as a source for corporate financing idd said 
under the agreement for private placement electronic trading 
situs owuld be a division or subsidiary of the exchange 
the exchange would be responsible for regulating and 
administering the system which would be developed operated owned 
and maintained by reuters a worldwide business newsgathering and 
informationdistribution organization

alls not happy here on jolly road home 
of the nations thirdlargest computer company 
unisys corp the behemoth created by burroughs corps 1986 
purchase of sperry corp is struggling mightily to make money once 
again after reporting a staggering 639 million loss last year 
since last october it has slashed more than 8000 jobs closed 
plants and refocused its mishmash of inherited product lines 
still the red ink keeps flowing in july unisys reported a 
451 million loss in the years first half after paying 
preferredstock dividends two weeks ago the companys stock price 
plunged to a 52week low after several industry analysts reduced 
their earnings forecasts 
the cutbacks losses and a pentagon bribery scandal at the 
unisys defense division are said to have taken their toll on morale 
among the companys 78000 employees 
but the payback from the belttightening should appear later 
this year analysts say when they expect unisys to report a profit 
in the fourth quarter 
once those plants are closed and the benefits start flowing 
through its virtually impossible to build a scenario where 
theyre not in the black said rick martin an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the situation wasnt always bleak most observers agree 
burroughs 48 billion merger with sperry initially was a success 
the consolidation of the two oldline computer companies led to a 
streamlining that cut costs and improved profits 
in a burst of optimism w michael blumenthal the burroughs 
chairman who engineered the merger launched the renamed company on 
an ambitious plan to double annual sales to 20 billion by 1993 he 
predicted unisys would rival international business machines corp 
the worlds largest computer maker 
but the scheme of the former us treasury secretary flopped 
the computer industrys breakneck growth slowed to a trot in the 
late 1980s and major corporations began to move away from large 
mainframe computers unisys mainstay product to smaller models 
that left unisys with warehouses full of unsold computers and 
unneeded production lines analysts say 
you dont take two slowgrowing companies and turn them into 
one fast growing company said martin 
with profits strangled unisys was forced to borrow up to 15 
billion to pay shareholder dividends analysts say pumping up its 
debt to a high of 41 billion last year 
unisys also saw its important government business drop last year 
when its defense unit was barred from bidding on contracts for 
three months as part of the ill winds probe of pentagon fraud 
several unisys executives pleaded guilty to bribery and unisys 
still faces a possible fine 
to help fix the problems blumental in october announced the 
sweeping restructuring taking a 231 million charge against 
earnings to pay for it in april he relinquished daytoday 
control and his chief executive title to james a unruh a longtime 
burroughs executive 
in a recent interview unruh spoke frankly about the companys 
troubles 
we had a very difficult 1989 it seemed like whatever could go 
wrong did go wrong he said at the companys sprawling 
headquarters complex in this philadelphia suburb 
unruh admitted unisys misjudged the us computer industry 
slowdown but noted the companys plight wasnt unique 
digitial equipment corp the worlds secondlargest computer 
company reported its firstever quarterly loss earlier this year 
and has eliminated thousands of jobs ibm also has been cutting 
costs 
the industry is undergoing a painful transition as large 
computers are losing favor to cheaper and less profitable 
midsize and desktop models that often are linked in networks 
in addition companies increasingly want computers that use 
industrystandard operating systems the base layer of software 
that controls internal computer functions with the move to these 
open systems which unisys has joined profits have been 
squeezed as computers become more like interchangeable commodities 
unruh said the cutbacks have been painful both to him and 
employees 
closing plants is not a pleasant process reducing employment 
is not a pleasant process at all said the softspoken north 
dakota native whose teamoriented management style is said to 
differ markedly from that of the more demonstrative blumenthal 
unruh 49 said no more major cutbacks are planned but he 
wouldnt rule them out if the economy continues to sour unisys 
also could be hurt by a steeperthanexpected scaleback in us 
defense spending which accounts for about 22 percent of its 
revenue he said 
unisys which traces its history to the first successful 
electronic computer the giant eniac machine built at the 
university of pennsylvania in the mid1940s has reorganized its 
operations around customer lines of business instead of the size of 
its computers 
for example it has targeted the airline health care 
insurance banking and phone companies among others as areas 
where it can offer specialized software and services along with 
unisys computers 
the strategy is a contrast from past practice unruh said when 
unisys would tell its customers weve got the next bigger 
faster box for you here it is good luck because thats where we 
stopped 
by becoming an expert in particular businesses and providing 
specialized software unisys can differentiate itself from 
competitors who also are promoting industrystandard computers 
unruh said 
sensing that hooking computers in a network was a growing trend 
unisys made two major acquistions in 1988 timeplex inc a maker 
of networking equipment which it acquired in a 300 million stock 
swap and convergent technologies inc a maker of networked 
desktop computers which it bought for 350 million 
unisys says it will provide ways to use mainframe computers as 
the information hub of computer networks that adhere to 
industry standards at the desktop level 
a strategy based on networked industrystandard computers is 
not foolproof said wendy abramowitz an analyst at argus research 
corp a new york investment research firm almost every computer 
company is singing the same song making it a very competitive 
market she said 
also the company must not alienate its many longtime mainframe 
customers analysts say these machines will be based on the old 
burroughs and sperry proprietary systems for the foreseeable future 
debt reduction is another area unruh has targeted the company 
announced in june it would sell 150 million in convertible 
preferred stock to mitsui amp co unisys longtime japanese business 
partner to reduce unisys debt by that amount 
that also could help boost unisys stock price which sank to 
around 8 a share in recent weeks from a high of 3025 last year 
i can understand why the stock price has gone down people 
want to see results said unruh the actions to be taken are 
just the basic actions of turning the business around

the government is seeking to get italys 
fiat group back in the bidding for its ailing state truckmaker 
empresa nacional de autocamiones sa enasa because its earlier 
deal with germanys daimlerbenz ag has collapsed a newspaper said 
spains leading daily el pais wednesday reported that spanish 
industry ministry officials opened talks with fiat after an 
agreement for a joint buyout by daimlerbenz and man ag fell apart 
in a decision last november the spanish government gave the nod 
to a joint bid for enasa by daimlerman over offers by fiat spa 
anglodutch truckmaker daf nv and ab volvo of sweden 
daimlerman had offered to pay 36 billion pesetas or about 380 
million for a total 80 percent stake enasas state owner the 
national industrial institute would hold the rest 
but in july the west german federal cartel office stunned spain 
by blocking the purchase on antitrust grounds even though the west 
german government had strongly lobbied spain for the deal 
el pais said industry ministry claudio aranzadi traveled to 
turin italy in early august to meet with fiat managing director 
cesare romiti 
on wednesday an industry spokesman said talks with daimlerbenz 
continued but he declined to confirm or deny contacts had been 
made with fiat officials 
a fiat spokesman said he had no knowledge of meetings with 
spanish officials 
enasa posted profits last year of 240 million pesetas or 247 
million ending years of losses

condition in august evidence of new softening in the labor market 
would bolster the case for the central bank to loosen its monetary 
policy

united states will regret involvement in the middle east appeared 
to have only a minor impact on the dollar if the persian gulf

wheat futures prices rebounded strongly wednesday on the chicago 
board of trade ending a sixday decline amid speculation the 
united states will offer food credits to the soviet union 
other grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher after the 
agriculture department reported a slight deterioration in the 
condition of the us soybean crop 
on other commodity markets oil and precious metal futures 
advanced and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 263 a bushel corn futures

bushel oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with september at 
108 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 5 cents higher

wheats rally represented the markets first upward move since 
aug 24 when the september contract settled at 284 a bushel 
the september price fell 28 cents or about 10 percent in the 
interim reflecting an abundance of wheat on the world market due 
to favorable growing conditions in much of the northern hemisphere 
analysts said speculation that the united states will offer the 
soviets food credits mounted after agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said wednesday that deteriorating soviet food supplies 
could warrant a technical exemption from a law prohibiting such 
credits to countries that are not among americas mostfavored 
trading partners 
i think theyre going to get credit said katharina zimmer 
grains analyst with merrill lynch capital markets inc 
considering how the soviet union has supported the us 
position in the persian gulf id be willing to bet you five bucks 
they will get it she said 
anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said rumors circulated that president bush and 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev would strike a deal on food 
credits at their meeting this weekend but frick said she doubted 
the process would move that quickly 
oil prices rose on the new york mercantile exchange as tensions 
rose in the persian gulf the higher prices extended tuesdays 
sharp gains and reignited inflation fears which prompted a runup 
in precious metal futures prices on new yorks commodity exchange

hussein said wednesday that the children in iraq are dying 
because of unsupported economic sanctions but he appeared to 
retract an earlier appeal for foreign help to circumvent the

oil prices rose to nearly 30 per barrel 
wednesday as traders began buying in response to iraqi leader 
saddam husseins televised call for an arab holy war against the 
west 
light sweet crude for october delivery rose 65 cents to close at 
2977 per barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the price 
rose as high as 2989 before falling back 
it was full of religious fanaticism and i think people kind 
of got nervous and started bidding the market back up said brian 
tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers inc 
were getting close to that 30 mark and it looks like people 
might want to get up there and test that 30 area he said 
traders also said prices were partially keeping pace with a 
bullish oil market in europe 
other petroleum futures were mixed 
unleaded gasoline dropped 225 cents to 9227 cents per gallon 
for october delivery speculators were either taking profits from 
the previous days jump or selling gasoline so they could buy more 
crude said randall rothenberg a broker with dean witter reynolds 
inc 
later contract months for gasoline were up 
home heating oil for october rose 98 cent to 8337 cents per 
gallon while later months were also up natural gas was up to 
1514 per 1000 cubic feet compared with tuesdays close of 
1510 
traders said wednesdays rise in oil prices was also partly 
attributable to speculation on wall street that the american 
petroleum institute on wednesday would report a decline in the 
nations stockpiles of crude 
the api report which is released after the markets close said 
crude stocks for the week ending aug 31 were at 3722 million 
barrels down from 3766 million barrels a week earlier but up from 
3358 million barrels a year earlier 
crude imports were up to 68 million barrels a day compared 
with imports of 66 million barrels a week earlier and 64 million 
barrels a year earlier api said 
crude stocks were down because companies were drawing on their 
supplies tagler said 
the stockpile of gasoline was virtually unchanged for the week 
at 2105 million barrels imports stood at 192000 barrels 
compared with 287000 barrels a week earlier and 221000 barrels a 
year earlier 
analysts have attributed the drop in gasoline imports to 
supplies that were diverted to other buyers after the boycott of 
iraq and kuwait cut into the worlds refining capacity companies 
also traditionally try to avoid holding onto too much gasoline 
after labor day considered to be the end of the peak summer 
driving season an api spokesman said 
the price of gasoline dropped at the pump the american 
automobile association reported wednesday the nationwide average 
price for a gallon of selfserve unleaded regular was 1273 down 
34 cents from a week earlier the aaa said 
the retail pump price remained about 198 cents higher than on 
aug 1 the day before iraq invaded kuwait the aaa said 
a spokesman for the service station dealers of america said the 
decrease was attributable to lower prices charged by gasoline 
suppliers

ibm unveiled a new generation of 
mainframe computers wednesday that it said would double the power 
of its most profitable machines and cement their position at the 
center of office computing 
the announcement made at the companys us mainframe factory 
was billed as the most important rollout for international business 
machines corp in 25 years 
the success of the new machines is crucial to the worlds 
largest computer company because it derives about half its income 
from mainframes and associated equipment and software 
the move was well publicized in advance but industry experts 
were still impressed with the scope of the companys new strategy 
the announcement crystallized a new vision for how ibm believes 
mainframe computers should fit into todays decentralized computer 
systems where desktop machines are almost as common as telephones 
you saw it piecemeal before said industry consultant sam 
albert the new machines show that ibm intends the mainframe to be 
the traffic cop of computer networks said albert a former ibm 
executive 
in addition to annoucing 18 new machines ibm said it would 
provide systems that will allow mainframes to manage information on 
all sorts of computers throughout a company 
such systems would address the growing concern of companies that 
too much information is spread among desktop computers that dont 
communicate well with each other 
the company said it also will provide products that will make it 
easier to connect nonibm computers to a network of ibm machines 
ibms new mainframes provide about twice the processing power of 
the three mainframe lines they replace and are priced from 70480 
to 228 million the line is ibms response to several japanese 
mainframe makers that recently announced new highend models 
on tuesday fujitsu ltd announced a new mainframe it said would 
be the worlds fastest ibm dismissed that claim saying it has 
provided the most powerful machines for years and will continue to 
do so 
the new computers are part of a model line ibm calls system390 
it is intended to be the successor to ibms original mainframe 
line the system360 which was introduced in 1964 and the 
system370 introduced in 1970 
among the machines advances are fiberoptic lines that 
compared with the copper lines they replace more than double the 
rate at which information can be transferred to the computers from 
the huge datastorage devices used with mainframes 
the fiberoptic lines which transmit data as flashes of laser 
light also allow the datastorage devices to be located several 
miles from the computers themselves instead of several hundred 
feet with copper cable ibm said that would give customers more 
flexibility in locating computer rooms 
ibm also will provide the means to link together up to eight of 
the new models to vastly increase processing power this is the 
first time ibm has provided such a linkup 
in addition ibm announced the first encryption device that can 
built into a computer the optional coding device would be useful 
to protect the security of transactions such as electronic funds 
tranfers between banks the company said it also said the central 
intelligence agency has expressed interest in the device 
ibm also said it will sell devices that can boost the power of 
the most powerful model of the new line to supercomputer status 
supercomputers are used for such calculationintensive tasks as 
weather forecasting 
the socalled priceperformance measure of the new 
computers which compares the price with the machines processing 
power is 15 percent to 25 percent greater than the models they 
replace said rick martin an analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc 
ibm said the system390 represents the first generational change 
in its mainframes in which owners of most existing machines can 
easily upgrade to the new line 
the two highend models of the new line wont be available until 
the third quarter of 1991 ibm said that could provoke some 
customers who need that level of power to consider competing 
machines analysts said 
ibm said the delay was due to normal testing procedures on the 
advanced processors that will drive the new highend models 
the processors in the models that are available immediately or 
in coming months are based on ibms existing highend mainframes 
the 3090 series said carl j conti the ibm senior vice president 
in charge of mainframes 
conti said he expected customers who need the power of the new 
highend machines will buy the models that are available then 
upgrade the computers with the new processors 
ibm has come under increasing pressure in recent years from 
makers of ibmcompatible mainframes principally fujitsu hitachi 
data systems corp and amdahl corp 
amdahl is 45 percent owned by fujitsu while hitachi data 
systems is partially owned by hitachi of japan 
these three companies often undercut ibms prices and their 
share of the mainframe market has been growing as ibms has slipped 
however ibm still holds about 87 percent of the us highend 
mainframe market says computer intelligence a la jolla calif 
research firm 
because wednesday announcement had been expected the stock 
market reaction was muted ibm shares finished off 12 cents for 
the day at 10237

a house subcommittee chairman said wednesday he 
will ask that two former denver developers be subpoenaed to answer 
questions about their finances and failed silverado banking 
savings and loan 
kenneth good and bill walters defaulted on 132 million in loans 
from the former denver thrift they had been scheduled to appear 
thursday before the house banking committees subcommittee on 
financial institutions supervision regulation and insurance 
members of congress want the two to explain how they can 
maintain affluent lifestyles after claiming in earlier 
congressional testimony to have a negative net worth 
this week good and walters both refused to appear before the

three economists told congress wednesday that 
foreign investment in the united states can be good but must be 
closely watched by the government 
the danger they said is predatory investment by foreign 
companies that buy their american competitors and shut them down 
they also said business practices of other nations can conflict 
with american philosophies even to the point of running against 
us law 
we must reject the assertion that corporate nationality does 
not matter said steven cohen director of the berkeley 
roundtable on the international economy at the university of 
california 
for example japans behavior is determined by rules that are 
very different from the united states said clyde prestowitz 
director of the economic strategy institute in washington 
most traditional business practices of japan are contrary to 
antitrust laws he said 
prestowitz cohen and robert reich of harvard university 
expressed their views to a congressional panel studying the 
governments role in a world economy dominated by multinational 
corporations 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic 
committee asked the economists if a federal law should be passed 
limiting government subsidies to americanowned companies 
cohen said the ownership of the firm wasnt as important as its 
behavior in the united states for example a foreignowned company 
that is creating employment bringing in new technology and 
developing technology in the united states is benefiting this 
country he said 
problems occur when foreign ownership starts changing the 
politics of the united states the economists warned 
reich criticized the governments enforcement of antitrust 
laws he said lack of enforcement has caused monopolistic and 
predatory practices

in apparently the first reversal of its kind 
for the office of thrift supervision a federal judge ruled 
wednesday that the government must return control of the states 
largest thrift to its management 
us district judge dale saffels ordered the federal ots to 
release the franklin savings association from receivership by 10 
am thursday saffels said decision to place franklin under 
control of the federal resolution trust corp in february was 
arbitrary and capricious 
further saffels found the ots decision lacked any basis in 
fact 
saffels also retained jurisdiction in the case for the next 90 
days meaning the ots cannot appoint another conservator or attempt 
to place franklin in receivership during that time without his 
approval 
saffels told reporters that after 90 days the ots could move 
against franklin again that could mean more court hearings he 
said 
and wed probably start over again he said 
in washington ots spokesman william fulwider said he believes 
it is the first time a court has returned control of an sampl from 
the agency to private management the ots was set up about a year 
ago as part of the savings and loan bailout legislation 
harris weinstein chief counsel of the ots said in a statement 
that the thrift agency regretted saffels decision 
we firmly believe the government acted in a timely and proper 
manner in taking over franklin an institution that was being 
operated with insufficient capital and in an unsafe and unsound 
manner said the statement released in washington 
ots continues to believe that the takeover of franklin was 
fully justified and in the best interests of taxpayers the 
deposit insurance fund and the institutions depositors 
weinsteins statement said the ots plans to appeal the decision 
vigorously he said the agency will ask the district court to 
stay its order while the appeal is pending 
if that motion is denied the ots will immediately seek a stay 
from the federal court of appeals in denver weinstein said

t boone pickens is taking his battle against a 
japanese auto parts manufacturer to us newspapers thursday with a 
advertising campaign proclaiming america you lost the economic 
war 
in fullpage ads appearing in the new york times and washington 
post pickens says his fight with koito manufacturing co ltd is 
an example of how japan is closed to foreign investors 
the ads also claim the japanese economy is being protected by 
the us military in the middle east and providing little in return 
with 26 percent pickens is the largest shareholder of koito but 
has been rejected in repeated attempts to gain seats on the board 
of directors koito claims pickens is a stalking horse for another 
japanese corporate raider 
pickens accuses toyota motor co koitos largest customer and 
second largest shareholder of controlling koito and blocking him 
in order to keep hidden its amount of control 
the japanese refuse to play on a level playing field causing 
the loss of american jobs and a growing us trade imbalance the 
ads say now japan is even refusing to fully support americas 
military efforts in the middle east where japan gets all of its oil 
to fuel its economic machine 
japans cartels are taking us to the cleaners and laughing 
all the way to the bank pickens said now they are evening 
doing it under the protection of our aircraft in the middle east 
earlier this week prime minister toshiki kaifu announced an aid 
package of 1 billion for the usled force arrayed against iraq 
and further assistance for middle east countries hurt by the 
embargo on baghdad 
the government also asked the countrys private industry to help 
support the multinational force in the persian gulf by providing 
jeeps carcarrying ships and other products and services 
readers are asked to write president bush trade representative 
carla hills japanese us ambassador ryohei murata and others to 
complain about toyota and other japanese cartels taking advantage 
of americas fairness 
pickens plans to spend several hundred thousand dollars on the 
campaign said associate andrew littlefair the ads will also 
appear later in usa today plus large regional newspapers and 
special interest magazines 
the ads also repeat taunts such as yankee go home and 
remember pearl harbor pickens heard at koitos annual meeting 
earlier this summer 
i think the ad appears to be blatant japanbashing said 
koito spokesman richard wolf and i think it is attempting to 
appeal to the lowest common denominator and i dont think that tack 
is going to be successful 
what the ads are designed to do is camouflage the fact that he 
is pursuing his own personal financial agenda and that is to 
obtain a greenmail payment for koito stock that he is stuck with 
wolf said

the united states wants its allies to 
pay the entire cost of its military buildup in the persian gulf an 
estimated 1 billion a month senior administration officials said 
wednesday 
the officials provided some of the first specific figures on 
what president bush had in mind when he called last week for 
americas allies to pay their fair share of the campaign against 
iraqi president saddam hussein 
bush directed two of his closest cabinet aides secretary of 
state james a baker iii and treasury secretary nicholas brady on 
global fundraising missions 
baker was scheduled to tour the oilrich capitals of the middle 
east while brady was in the middle of a whirlwind tour of four 
capitals in four days 
after meetings with french officials and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher bradys delegation made a refueling stop in 
anchorage before flying on to meetings friday with south korean 
president roh taewoo and japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
in london baker pronounced mrs thatcher enormously 
supportive aides said she promised detailed figures soon 
the secretary also said his french visit was a success 
the senior administration officials briefing reporters on 
condition that they not be named said that bradys mission was 
focusing on two types of assistance 
one is emergency aid for countries especially hard hit by the 
trade embargo against iraq and the other is cash and contributions 
to defray the costs incurred by the united states in its big 
buildup of troops and ships in saudi arabia and the persian gulf 
the officials put the total cost of the buildup at 6 billion 
through the end of 1990 and estimated it would average 1 billion a 
month after that 
a request to allies to meet the entire us cost is reasonable 
one official said because they couldnt buy this military 
capability anywhere else in the world 
the officials indicated that the administration hoped for many 
contributions such as oil air and sea transportation and medical 
supplies in part to blunt the criticism that cash donations 
effectively turn the us military into a mercenary force 
one official said the worldwide search for donations was linked 
in part to the us budget deficit 
brady told reporters traveling aboard his plane wednesday that 
the administration remained opposed to any efforts to reduce the 
targets for deficit reduction next year 
he said the president strongly favored reducing the deficit 
projected at 231 billion for the 12 months beginning oct 1 by 
50 billion next year and reducing cumulative deficits by 500 
billion over five years 
egypt jordan and turkey would be the principal candidates for 
trade asssistance estimated as needing 35 billion through the 
end of this year and another 7 billion next year 
the officials said that the conversations with thatcher and the 
french centered primarily on this issue and involved a dicusssion 
of a possible 3 billion in aid that the 12nation european 
community was scheduled to take up friday at a meeting of european 
finance ministers in rome 
in addition to aid to the socalled front line states of egypt 
turkey and jordan and the military payments to the united states 
the administration also wants to raise an unspecified amount to be 
used to alleviate economic damage from rising oil prices in 
countries such as the philippines brazil and the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe 
the officials would not discuss an overall price tag but the 
various elements could well add up to more than 25 billion 
the paris and london stopovers were seen as a way for the united 
states to gain endorsements for bushs call for burdensharing 
before the administration solicits japan and west germany two 
economic superpowers who have been accused especially by many 
members of congress of not doing enough so far in the persian gulf 
crisis 
the officials on bradys plane said that japans pledge of 1 
billion in aid was a good beginning but they did not dispute 
reports that the administration will press for more 
one officials said that taiwan a country that is not on the 
travel agenda of either brady or baker would be approached by a 
thirdparty emissary and asked for support because of diplomatic 
relations with mainland china the united states is limited in the 
types of official contact it can have with taiwan 
before leaving london brady rejected a suggestion that foreign 
leaders might resent being leaned on by the united states for 
economic help 
quite the contrary mrs thatcher thought it was exactly the 
right thing to do brady said

a federal judge wednesday refused to stop home 
box office inc from showing films containing songs copyrighted by 
broadcast music inc in a licensing dispute involving nearly all 
of hbos programming schedule 
but us district judge john sprizzo ordered hbo to pay bmi an 
interim fee for broadcasting films containing songs by bmi 
composers bmi sued hbo in january as hbos license was about to 
expire and the two sides couldnt agree on a new fee 
the broad licensing dispute which involves several lawsuits 
focuses on who and how much should be paid to music syndicates for 
the songs heard during movies 
sprizzo refused to slap an injunction on hbo that would have 
prevented the paytelevision service from showing about 80 movies 
on its september schedule that contain bmi songs including 
batman 
since its license expired jan 1 hbo has continued to broadcast 
such films without paying a fee 
we would have no schedule without bmi music hbo general 
counsel john redpath jr said and without a schedule we dont 
have a business 
bmi attorney robert sisk could not be reached for comment 
the lawsuit was filed amid efforts by bmi to boost its cable 
television levies beyond raising basic rates bmi wants to collect 
from local cable systems as well as from cable programmers it now 
charges just programmers that aspect of the case still is in 
litigation redpath said 
bmi represents more than 100000 composers and publishers of 
more than 15 million songs collecting a contracted fee whenever 
one of its songs is played it licenses radio and television 
stations hotel and restaurant chains even discotheques 
hbo owned by time warner inc has more than 23 million 
subscribers making it the largest paytelevision service in the 
nation 
redpath said hbo has paid for music rights for more than a 
decade and was willing to negotiate a new fee he said sprizzo 
suggested hbo pay bmi 15 cents per subscriber which redpath called 
too high redpath said the two sides would negotiate 
hbos fees amounted to about 27 cents per subscriber to bmi and 
the american society of composers authors and publishers which 
has about 45000 members 
bmi demanded a split license from hbo in which the cable service 
would buy performance rights for programs only until they are 
transmitted to the local oeprator the operator which transmits to 
the home viewer would have to negotiate licenses separately 
bmi has named manhattan cable television inc a local operator 
and a unit of time warner in the same lawsuit hbo contends that 
split licenses violate antitrust laws and says local operators 
with dozens of channels would be hardpressed to negotiate 
individual licenses for each program 
bmi lawyers have maintained that hbo has not proven that 
operators cannot negotiate individual licenses

the federal trade commission filed an 
administrative complaint against the college football association 
and capital citiesabc inc on wednesday saying their national 
television contracts are anticompetitive 
the fivepage complaint a copy of which was obtained by the 
associated press said competition among schools and networks for 
college football games has been hindered and that consumers have 
been deprived of the selection of college football games that would 
otherwise have been televised in a competitive environment 
the ftc asked that the cfa and cap cities appear before an 
administrative law judge on nov 13 in washington the ftc could 
void the national television contracts and prohibit the cfa from 
negotiating new deals for all its members 
abc currently televises games under a contract with the big ten 
and pacific10 conferences the cfas 64 million fouryear 
contract with cbs expires after this season and it is scheduled to 
begin a 210 million fiveyear deal with abc in 1991 
in addition the cfa has a deal with espn that expires after 
this season and a 125 million fiveyear renewal with espn that 
begins in 1991 cap cities owns 80 percent of espn and the other 20 
percent is owned by rjr nabisco inc 
the cfa is comprised of 64 schools from all major conferences 
except the big ten and pac10 the association announced the filing 
of the complaint at its boulder colo office after lew engman 
its washington lawyer received the papers 
we are disappointed that the ftc has decided to file a 
complaint against the cfa the association said in a statement 
such action however should not be construed as a finding that 
the cfa has acted unlawfully but rather as an initiation of the 
formal hearing process 
abc sports spokesman mark mandel said the network did not have a 
comment since it had not yet seen the complaint 
engman said the ftc did not take the more drastic step of going 
to federal district court for an injunction against the contracts 
mary l azcuenaga one of the commissioners dissented from the 
complaint another commissioner deborah k owen dissented in part 
after the administrative law judge makes his ruling either side 
can appeal to the five commissioners of the ftc if the full 
commission rules against the cfa the association can appeal to the 
us court of appeals 
the ftc scheduled a news conference for thursday to discuss the 
complaint the papers say that competition among schools in the 
marketing of college football telecasts has been hindered 
restrained foreclosed and frustrated and competition among 
telecasters of college football games has been hindered 
restrained foreclosed and frustrated 
the ftc said these acts constitute unfair methods of 
competition in or affecting commerce 
the cfa began marketing football games in 1984 in june of that 
year the us supreme court ruled that the ncaa violated antitrust 
law by selling national tv contracts

the dollar approached its lowest opening level in 
almost a year against the japanese yen thursday while share prices 
on the tokyo stock exchange inched up 
the dollar opened at 14148 yen down 082 yen from its 
wednesday close the dollar was quoted at 14165 yen late during 
new yorks wednesday session 
the dollar opened at 14097 yen on oct 19 1989 
a trader with fuji bank who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the lower opening was in part due to a rumor that life 
insurance companies had sold dollars in sydney prior to the 
opening of the tokyo market 
buy orders for the dollar appeared on the tokyo market shortly 
after it opened he said 
dealers are adjusting positions ahead of possible credit 
easing by the us federal reserve and employment statistics due 
to come out friday he said 
many economists say the us economy is headed into a recession 
and the fed will move to lower interest rates to spark economic 
activity 
lower interest rates tend to make a nations currency less 
attractive to foreign investors 
in stock trading the closely watched nikkei stock average of 
225 selected issues rose 3230 points or 013 percent in the 
first 30 minutes of trading on wednesday the index fell 82930

the chicago mercantile exchange said wednesday it 
wants to tighten up the socalled circuit breakers in its 
stockindex futures market in a further attempt to prevent a 
runaway stockmarket collapse 
the merc said it had applied to the commodity futures trading 
commission to reduce the maximum daily price limit for standard amp 
poors 500 index futures to 20 points from 30 points 
the new limit would be equivalent to about 150 points on the dow 
jones industrial average the current limit of 30 points is equal 
to more than 250 dow points 
the mercs board of governors approved the lower limit after 
studying the workings of circuit breakers during recent periods of 
extreme market volatility that occurred during the week after iraq 
invaded kuwait in early august 
on the whole the circuit breakers have been given high marks 
and have been cited as having a stabilizing effect on the market 
the exchange said in a statement 
after consultations with futures and securities industry 
market participants the board concluded it would be beneficial to 
further reduce the maximum daily price limit for sampp futures the 
merc said 
sampp 500 futures are the most widely traded stockindex futures 
which are contracts to buy and sell baskets of stocks the 
contracts enable investors to hedge against stockmarket losses or 
speculate on stock prices without actually owning stocks 
some critics contend computerdriven trading strategies 
involving huge blocks of stocks and futures can cause violent price 
swings in the stock market limits on the price movement of the 
futures contracts are intended to act as brakes on a runaway stock 
market
