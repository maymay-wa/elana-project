the wife and son of starsky and hutch star 
paul michael glaser are infected with the virus which causes aids 
and the couples daughter has already died from the disease 
although elizabeth glaser and her 5yearold son have not 
developed aids the couples first child daughter ariel died of 
aids complications last year at age 7 glaser the former star of 
the cop show starsky and hutch is the only family member not 
infected 
lesser men would have walked said mrs glaser who has taken 
the antiaids drug azt for the past 18 months he never made us 
feel we were anything but a family 
glaser said the family had no choice we have grown up a hell 
of a lot it was either grow up or perish he said 
the glasers have strived to keep their family life as normal as 
possible but they anticipate that will change they told the los 
angeles times in a story in fridays editions 
they said they decided to go public with their pain after they 
learned the national enquirer was planning a story on them the 
tabloid declined to comment 
we begged them not to run the story but they said it was 
newsworthy said glaser who is now a film director 
our fear is the greatest for our son mrs glaser said it 
is our right to tell him when he is strong enough and old enough to 
handle the information now we may not have that choice 
glaser who played the streetwise plainclothes detective dave 
starsky in the police action series that ran from september 1975 to 
august 1979 acknowledged it is not easy for him to talk about the 
tragedy he faces 
this has to be a story about how we rise above our fears how 
we all have to be stronger than we ever thought we could be he 
said 
glasers former costar david soul said he had been unaware of 
the familys situation and encouraged the public to support the 
glasers by helping to fight the deadly disease 
i have been deeply saddened to learn of the events of these 
past several years and of the profound loss which paul and elizabeth 
have suffered soul said but i am also inspired by the strength 
of their commitment to each other and to their children 
the familys nightmare began in 1981 when mrs glaser contracted 
hiv after receiving seven pints of blood 
she had been rushed to a hospital for the transfusions when she 
began hemorrhaging in her ninth month of carrying ariel 
four years later her daughter was hospitalized with a stubborn 
illness tests confirmed it was aids 
the glasers said ariel contracted the virus from her mother 
through eight months of breastfeeding the boy contracted it in the 
womb 
after her daughters death last year mrs glaser former exhibit 
director for the local childrens museum turned much of her 
attention to raising money for pediatric aids research she has 
collected more than 5 million 
her efforts have drawn the support of many celebrities and 
politicians including former president ronald reagan and his wife 
nancy 
her story also moved kitty dukakis the wife of the former 
democratic presidential candidate michael 
nobody in that short of time has touched me so said mrs 
dukakis i have never been with anybody who could rise above their 
own pain to help so many other people 
as of aug 1 aids had been diagnosed in 102621 americans of 
whom more than half or 59391 have died according to the national 
centers for disease control no one is known to have recovered from 
aids 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by the 
human immunodeficiency virus which damages the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to death from infections and 
cancer 
it is spread through sexual contact needles or syringes shared 
by drug abusers transfusions of infected blood or blood products 
or from an infected mother to her baby before or during birth 
however screening procedures not available when mrs glaser had 
her transfusions have greatly reduced the risk of acquiring the 
virus through tainted blood

the second test flight of 
the b2 stealth bomber was scrubbed in midflight because of a crack 
in a part provided by a defense contractor once fined for billing 
fraud air force officials said 
a hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive which powers 
the 530 million hightech jets generators and controls caused oil 
pressure to drop during the aug 16 test flight air force capt 
tess taft said thursday 
it wasnt anything critical that would have caused the plane to 
crash she said it was a minor problem 
the flight of the batwing bomber designed to pass through enemy 
radar undetected was scheduled to last up to four hours but was 
halted after about one hour 
the casing for the aircrafts no 1 accessory drive was made by 
sundstrand aviation of rockford ill which pentagon officials 
indefinitely suspended last year from doing business with the 
government 
sundstrand was fined 115 million in october for overcharging the 
government for parts billing the pentagon for babysitting costs 
country club dues and executive servants 
the suspension did not affect contracts the company already had 
including the one for the b2 casings 
sundstrand spokesman claude vernon said he would not comment on 
the flaw 
the part was redesigned to make it thicker after laboratory tests 
indicated the casing would work better if strengthened ms taft 
said 
theres absolutely nothing wrong with the part as originally 
designed she said things break ok 
officials for northrop corp which builds the b2 said the 
thinner casings measuring four feet long one foot wide and five 
inches thick were examined and cleared as airworthy 
we wouldnt put anything in there that we thought was 
potentially defective said northrops b2 spokesman tony cantafio 
air force engineers continue to work with designers from 
northrop sundstrand and other subcontractors throughout the b2 
construction process and were fully aware of the modifications made 
to thicken the casing ms taft said 
cantafio and ms taft both said they were unaware of any plan to 
replace the thinner parts before the b2s next test flight 
the government has spent about 224 billion in the b2 program 
which is 18 months behind schedule and congress has balked at the 
thought of paying more than 500 million apiece for 132 bombers 
shrouded in secrecy for 10 years northrop and the pentagon last 
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes 
the pentagon wants 47 billion for the bomber in the coming 
fiscal year and it may need 8 billion in each of the three years 
of peak production 1992 to 1994

a state appeals court ruled friday that five boston 
public schools at the heart of a fierce dispute over budgetcutting 
can be closed 
schools superintendent laval wilson said the five schools will be 
closed as planned and affected parents will receive new school 
assignments for their children 
on july 25 the citys school committee voted to close the 
schools to meet mayor raymond flynns 362 million target budget and 
to ease a projected 26 million deficit going into the school year 
the threejudge appeals court panel ruled that the school 
committees vote was valid even though it erred when a required 
public hearing was delayed until aug 7 
parents who had fought the closings said they did not expect to 
appeal fridays decision which overturned a suffolk superior judge 
david m rosemans decision tuesday to block the closing plan 
school committee member rob cappucci said he preferred saving 
money by closing the schools rather than putting special programs 
like athletics on the chopping block 
i would rather close buildings than programs said cappucci 
wilson said the committee has made 3 million in administrative 
staff cuts

floridas second sweep of drug users and dealers 
netted more than 1400 arrests by friday evening as authorities 
combined reverse sting and trojan horse operations with search 
warrants and highway surveillance 
i think the idea is to just get as much crack off the street as 
we can and to once again send a message to people that are buying 
and selling crack that its not going to be tolerated said jim 
liljedal spokesman for the broward county sheriffs office 
by 1100 pm friday the roundup produced 6683 crack cocaine 
rocks 26 pounds of cocaine powder 1044 pounds of marijuana 52 
firearms 209 vehicles and 54667 in cash 
a total of 1465 arrests had been made by friday evening in the 
operation staffed by an estimated 1200 officers in all of the 
states 67 counties 
the 48hour crackdown dubbed operation rock pile ii was 
launched at 1201 am thursday and was coordinated by the florida 
sheriffs association 
a total of 2076 arrests were made in the first operation rock 
pile begun june 31 it also netted 3510 crack cocaine rocks 10 
pounds of cocaine powder 3 pounds of marijuana 327 vehicles 50 
firearms and 55107 cash 
crack a derivative of cocaine is sold in small chunks called 
rocks 
the only thing that surprised us intially was what seemed to be 
an unsually high amount of marijuana liljedal said at the 
operations command post in fort lauderdale 
in reverse stings officers pose as drug sellers and bust 
customers 
in trojan horse operations several deputies ride hidden in the 
back of a truck and jump out to make arrests when the driver is 
offered crack for sale by street corner dealers 
nothing seems to deter these people when theyre looking for 
crack or looking to sell it said liljedal

a 10yearold boy pleaded innocent friday 
to adult charges of criminal homicide in the march shooting of a 
7yearold girl who was riding a snowmobile in a lot adjacent to his 
home 
cameron kocher was 9 years old when police said he loaded his 
fathers 35caliber rifle pointed it out his parents bedroom 
window and shot jessica ann carr of gilbert in the back he has been 
free on 50000 bail 
cameron stood silently next to his attorney as monroe county 
judge ronald e vican addressing the boy as mr kocher 
explained the charges of criminal homicide aggravated assault and 
recklessly endangerment 
defense attorney charles hansford signed documents indicating 
camerons plea while the boy looked on and told the judge he had 
instructed the boy to stay quiet 
cameron stood before the judge with his arms folded occasionally 
looking at the ceiling and let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his 
parents after the proceedings ended 
jessica was riding on the back of a snowmobile march 6 in 
kresgeville with her friend and camerons nextdoor neighbor 
shannon ratti 13 when she was shot 
cameron was arrested two days later after police found the rifle 
with a telescopic sight a cut on the boys forehead and blood 
splattered in the room cameron said the rifle cut him when its 
recoil jammed the scopes eyepiece into his face 
in june vican refused to transfer camerons case to juvenile 
court saying the shooting was deliberate vicans decision followed 
four days of testimony from psychologists hired by the kochers and 
the state 
vican wrote in june that all four psychotherapists who examined 
cameron agreed he did not have any mental or emotional problems at 
the time of the shooting 
the psychologists disagreed however on whether cameron could 
understand the proceedings and participate in his defense the also 
disagreed on whether he could form the intent to kill 
cameron faced a prearraignment shortly after his arrest in 
march when bail was set at 50000 he has been free on bond since 
then 
assistant district attorney mark pazuhanich said in an interview 
he has ruled out seeking the death penalty he said if the boy is 
convicted punishment could range from probation in conjunction with 
psychiatric treatment to life imprisonment 
the defense has 30 days to file pretrial motions

why waltz when you can rock n roll 
wrote a visitor in the guest book at the medievalstyle castle of 
reputed cocaine trafficker camilo zapata vasquez 
the question reflects the fastlane philosophy obviously embraced 
by colombias wealthy drug lords and was revealed in the public 
confiscation of hundreds of their properties nationwide in an 
antinarcotics crackdown 
the sandstone castle ringed by formal gardens dominates a 
200acre compound of 10 buildings a dozen thoroughbred horses as 
well as goats ducks dogs and even a couple of flamingos visible 
from a nearby highway it has long been a landmark in chia a suburb 
13 miles north of bogota 
it was seized by the army this week and shown off to reporters 
on friday 
european and oriential antiques filled the castles richly 
appointed rooms lined with paintings statues and ceramic 
figurines beds were framed with crystal and bronze or four 
towering posters with marble bedside tables filled with electronics 
to open and shut doors and control video equipment 
a guest book provided a peek at the peculiar variety of people 
who visited the estate 
it is just one of many believed to have been owned by zapata 
vasquez even though he is considered a kind of secondstring 
smuggler lacking the householdname stature of reputed cartel 
bosses such as pablo escobar jorge ochoa and gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha 
the visitor who endorsed rock n roll signed his message 
apparently in jest m19 power m19 is the name accorded to a 
leftist guerrilla group operating in colombia although the 
traffickers are much more closely associated with rightwing death 
squads 
another visitor calling himself mad max wrote living by 
chance loving by choice and killing by profession 
an oct 10 1988 visitor named tuti wrote in a feminine hand 
happy birthday tomorrow theyll kill me and itll be your fault 
many women left their phone numbers after their signatures 
margarita zapata identified by army officials on the estate as 
zapatas sister was much more solemn may god and the virgin 
bless all of this and those who inhabit it 
the book also was signed by two men who identified themselves as 
local police station commanders two army lieutenants and an army 
captain two local mayors also signed one of them declaring few 
people can truly appreciate the history of this property 
a group of women from several embassies including yugoslavia 
uruguay chile canada and britain signed the book as did a tour 
from a religious society 
next door to the estate is a religious boarding school run by 
nuns 
in a garage and sprawling servants quarters attached to the 
castle were two new mercedes automobiles also confiscated 
there were also stables where an office wall was lined with 
ribbons and trophies an indoor swimming pool and gym tennis 
courts horse exercise trails and a modern thatchroofed cottage of 
many rooms 
there was a chapel as well dedicated to st francis of assisi 
with stained glass windows antique religious statues and pews for 
about 30 people 
studiously ignoring the dozens of soldiers who guarded the place 
were 10 groundskeepers who watered the wellkept lawns and acres of 
gardens trimmed the hundreds of yards of hedges and tended to the 
animals 
they gave contradicting statements about zapata vasquez he never 
came to stay he came regularly he just left a couple of weeks ago 
they all agreed on one thing they were underpaid receiving the 
minimum legal wage about 80 a month

the hospitality extended for 40 years 
by this haven for soviet bloc refugees is being strained as more 
east europeans take advantage of reforms and emigrate to the west 
while east germans flooding across the austrohungarian border 
this summer have enjoyed heartfelt welcomes other east european 
refugees find state support withering away 
women in the border town of moerbisch have spent days sorting old 
clothes cooking and giving hugs to exhausted east germans who 
stumble in after a grueling journey to freedom through the 
borderland brush 
you just have to help anyone with a sense of humanity has 
to said one woman her eyes filling with tears as she surveyed 
the large hall where tables were piled high with clothes and dazed 
east germans sat over sausages and bread 
i remember in 1956 my husband drove down to the border day and 
night with his truck to pick up the refugees she said on 
condition of anonymity recalling the mass exodus of hungarians 
after soviet tanks crushed hungarys antistalinist uprising 
in 1968 austria sheltered streams of czechoslovaks after other 
warsaw pact countries crushed the prague spring reforms 
and when martial law was declared in poland in 1981 at least 
35000 poles sought asylum here 
ilse tremmel chief organizer of moerbischs relief program is 
full of energy seeing that volunteers get rest and giving a 
mothers firm hug to a 17yearold boy who left his childhood and 
his parents on the other side of the eastwest divide 
the help has come from everywhere she says private 
individuals companies stores everyone is helping 
the east germans spend only days in austria before going to west 
germany 
but thousands of poles and hungarians want to remain and because 
of that they feel less welcome 
their asylum applications now are rejected on grounds they are 
not politically persecuted but seek only to improve their economic 
situation 
refugee peter mojzer doesnt see the distinction you cant 
separate the two he says if the communist party regulates 
everything then you cant live or work freely 
many austrians believe the hungarians and poles sponge off the 
state receiving free room and board plus meager monthly allowances 
while they wait years for applications to be processed 
but in july and august 3800 hungarians and poles stopped 
receiving the allowances and were turned out of governmentrented 
hotels and boarding houses 
they came to austria before may 1988 when the austrian 
government began rejecting most asylum applications 
interior minister franz loeschnak under fire from leftwingers 
who argue this violates austrias policy of sheltering all refugees 
insisted the poles and hungarians were informed months in advance 
but many said they were given only days notice 
about 800 jobs and language training for some poles and 
hungarians was arranged to end the furor 
but austria and the west in general still faces the dilemma of 
absorbing tens of thousands of east europeans expected to cross 
increasingly open borders 
pius strobl a leader of the small opposition greenalternative 
party noted that 10 percent of austrias population of 74 million 
are former refugees 
austrias declining population should encourage authorities to 
integrate new arrivals who are anxious to work he said 
two million refugees have come here since world war ii ended and 
613000 remain officials say last year 16000 applications for 
asylum were submitted double the number for 1986 
hungarians who refuse to return home and depend on charitable 
organizations complain they are trapped in a catch22 situation 
needing a work permit to secure a residence permit and a permanent 
place of residence to acquire a work permit 
who can guarantee that the reforms in hungary will continue 
asked ferenc briski who came to austria in 1987 
briskis family is among several that found lodging in eastern 
burgenland province with help from the greens and charity groups 
some live without electricity or heating 
hungarianborn wilma csoknyai recalls when she came to austria 
after world war ii and how impressed she was with the hospitality 
after the war when nobody had anything it was apparently 
easier to be a refugee she said now people cant imagine how 
it is to have nothing

a man described by police as a drug dealer 
was arrested for investigation of murder in the death of huey p 
newton but claimed selfdefense in killing the black panther 
founder police said friday 
tyrone robinson 25 of oakland was arrested on a weapons charge 
around 7 pm tuesday hours after newtons predawn murder on a west 
oakland sidewalk and 
investigators believe they recovered the 9mm pistol used in 
newtons killing police said but ballistics tests are still 
pending 
robinson considered the murder a means to advance in the 
black guerrilla family a narcotics distribution gang said sgt dan 
mercado at a early evening news conference at the oakland hall of 
justice 
he wanted to be a highmuckymuck mercado said later in an 
interview he was a foot soldier and he wanted to be a shot 
caller he figured we already knew we felt we had him and he new 
it 
the black guerrilla family is a prisonbased gang that operates 
in the states maximumsecurity prisons including san quentin 
where newton served time authorities said 
robinson currently on parole for a robbery conviction admitted 
to the killing early friday and is scheduled for arraignment 
tuesday mercado said 
mercado said newton and robinson have known each other for two 
years 
mercado said newton argued with robinson over a cocaine deal and 
that robinson then shot the 47yearold former leader of the black 
militancy movement in the 1960s 
robinson contended newton pulled a gun when the two met at a 
street corner in the drugtorn neighborhood but investigators said 
they found no evidence newton had been armed 
the killing occurred in a neighborhood where newton as minister 
of defense for the black panthers once tried to set up social 
programs to help destitue blacks 
police said robinson told them newton demanded drugs and that he 
refused to sell them to him police said the two argued for about a 
minute 
police said newton had crossed the black guerilla family 
several times in the past investigators believe newton stole drugs 
from the gang including an instance earlier this summer when 
robinson said he was robbed by newton of 14 crack cocaine rocks 
valued at 160 
mercado said a man accompanying robinson witnessed the shooting 
but police did not divulge whether the man arrested friday for 
investigation of auto theft backed up robinsons claim of 
selfdefense 
police said they had located several other witnesses who disputed 
robinsons account of the killing there have been no other arrests 
in the case mercado said 
robinson was arrested tuesday for investigation of felony 
possession of a firearm about a block from the crime scene he was 
questioned about newtons murder but was not considered a prime 
suspect until thursday 
two other men were arrested at the same time on weapons 
violations but are not considered suspects in the case mercado 
said 
police denied a report published thursday that three men had been 
linked to the killing but acknowledged for the first time that the 
men were arrested on weapons charges one block from where newton was 
slain about 12 hours earlier 
newtons slaying prompted a noontime protest march friday that 
started in the neighborhood where he was slain 
about 40 members of uhuru house waved banners carried placards 
with his photo and chanted who killed huey dont you tell no 
lie it was the government the government the fbi 
fbi infiltration of the black panther party had contributed to 
its gradual disintegration as the group founded more than 20 years 
ago drifted from operating ghetto social programs into violence and 
its members were killed 
officials in the fbis san francisco office did not immediately 
return a telephone message friday afternoon 
the protesters marched two miles to city hall and the alameda

vice president dan quayle visited nasas 
jet propulsion laboratory to congratulate voyager scientists and 
underscore his new interest in the us space program 
i am exceedingly delighted to be here on this very historic day 
for america and americas space program quayle told a receptive 
crowd of perhaps 1000 laboratory employees 
the crowd cheered as quayle said that unmanned missions the jet 
propulsion laboratorys specialty will continue to be an important 
part of the us space program 
we are seeing a beginning of a new era where well see a 
recommitment to space quayle said echoing comments he has made 
in recent months as he works hard to adopt the space program as his 
issue 
quayles visit friday morning followed voyager 2s close 
encounter with neptune that capped a 12year 44 billionmile 
flight that took the two voyager spacecraft to jupiter in 1979 
saturn in 1980 and 1981 and uranus in 1986 
quayle who had shown little interest in the space program before 
becoming vice president has now seized upon it as an issue he can 
use to improve his political fortunes 
its a great opportunity for him because ordinarily vice 
presidents have limited duties said david beckwith quayles 
press secretary 
the issue was handed to quayle by congress which established the 
national space council at the end of the reagan administration and 
designated the vice president as its head 
quayle is hoping to convince congress and the public that 
expenditures on space are worthwhile even in the face of continuing 
federal budget deficits 
on july 20 the 20year anniversary of the landing of a man on 
the moon president bush called for the permanent settlement of 
space by first returning to the moon and then sending a manned 
mission to mars 
bush charged nasa and quayle as head of the national space 
council with developing a plan to carry out those goals the plan 
is supposed to be delivered to bush in october 
quayles visit to the jet propulsion laboratory which included a 
briefing with laboratory officials and a tour of the voyager control 
center was patterned after a successful visit last month to the 
general dynamics space systems division is san diego 
quayle gave the same stump speech in both places contending that 
space exploration furthers scientific understanding provides jobs 
leads to new technology and inspires young people to seek careers in 
science or engineering

president bush appealing to other 
nations to rally behind colombian officials on the front line of 
the war against drugs is sending president virgilio barcos 
government a 65 million package to combat narcotics trafficking 
the aid announced friday by the summer white house consists 
primarily of aircraft mostly helicopters and a variety of other 
equipment and supplies but no us troops 
however presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said some us 
advisers would be sent to show colombians how to use and maintain 
the equipment he said they would number fewer than dozens but 
did not have a precise figure 
we will provide only material support and training the 
vacationing president said in a statement the united states has 
complete confidence in the capability of the colombian police and 
military to deal with this situation 
it is time for the united states and other countries of the 
world to stand with president barco during his courageous challenge 
to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of colombian 
society 
bush vowed to assist the colombian officials who are on the 
front line of the war against drugs 
colombia has been rocked by recent drugrelated violence 
including the assassination last week of the leading presidential 
candidate and this weeks bombings of homes and offices of 
government and political leaders 
fitzwater said eight huey transport helicopters would be sent to 
columbia next week and another 12 would be sent later along with a 
blackhawk helicopter for medical evacuation 
a us air force c5 transport plane brought in two bell 212 
helicopters friday that were delivered to colombian authorities the 
helicopters which add to six of the same type colombian police 
already had represent an immediate tangible response of the us 
government to president barcos steppedup war on the narcotics 
traffic the us embassy said in a statement 
fitzwater said the eight hueys would be used mainly for 
carrying troops and policemen into rural areas and for locating 
drug activity 
in addition another 20 helicopters previously bought by 
colombia and not part of the new package will also be shipped over 
the next few months fitzwater said 
the package includes another 86 million for light aircraft but 
the type and number has yet to be determined fitzwater said 
also in the package are machine guns and other small arms 
grenade launchers mortars aircraft ammunition radios jeeps 
ambulances field gear antitank weapons field trucks utility 
boats 18man assault boats that carry machine guns medical 
supplies tools and spare parts 
bushs statement reiterated the administrations vow to work with 
colombian legal officials in extraditing drug traffickers wanted in 
the united states 
fitzwater said the overall package represents a conclusion that 
we have a responsibility and an interest in helping them to the 
maximum degree possible 
the aircraft and supplies will help barco launch a major 
effort against the drug cartel fitzwater said 
the money comes from a special foreign aid fund and is separate 
from bushs new 8 billion antidrug program to be unveiled by the 
president in a nationally televised address sept 5 fitzwater said 
the drug at plan will also contain additional funds for colombia and 
other latin american countries 
the money is also separate from a 2 million program announced 
earlier in the week to help colombia set up security for public 
officials 
bush will meet with cabinet members involved in drug policy and 
drugpolicy coordinator william bennett here next week 
the president is midway through a threeweek vacation that runs 
through labor day evangelist billy graham was spending the weekend 
with the first family 
bush on friday followed what has been his usual pattern of 
athletic activities including golf boating and horseshoes 
at one point bush ran his 28foot speedboat fidelity into a 
hard submerged object either a rock or piece of wood forcing him 
to abandon a morning of boating 
however the mishap which damaged the housing of one of his 
propellers was quickly repaired by a local marina and bush was back 
on the water by late afternoon

the food and drug administration is beginning 
to draw up guidelines to market a female condom which its 
manufacturer says can help protect women from the aids virus and 
other sexually transmitted diseases 
colin m pollard an fda member of the panel that heard testimony 
on the device friday estimated that it will take wisconsin 
pharmacal co at least 18 months to conduct the study receive fda 
approval and market the female condom 
it will take us quite a while to just get the study going 
mary ann leeper of the jackson wis company said after the 
hearing the results of the hearing are about as good as we 
could expect 
leeper in a presentation at the hearing said the female condom 
is the only method that a woman can herself control to protect 
against infection from the aids virus and from other sexually 
transmitted diseases 
today if a woman asks a man to wear the male condom and he 
says no her choices are to take the risk or to get out of bed 
leeper told the panel a difficult decision in the heat of the 
moment 
the device displayed by leeper resembled a sock made of 
polyurethane a tough clear flexible plastic there are soft 
flexible rings at both ends 
leeper said the ring at the closed end is to aid insertion when 
properly used she said a sheath barrier is created within the 
vagina the ring at the open end of the device remains outside and 
protects the labia 
the female condom would cost about 150 leeper said and is 
designed for one use 
wisconsin pharmacal proposed to market the condom solely as a 
device to protect against the spread of sexually transmitted 
diseases 
but the fda advisory panel decided that before receiving approval 
such a barrier device should be tested on an unspecified number of 
women for long enough to prove that it is at least as effective as 
the male condom as a contraceptive 
the panel concluded that there was no ethical way to test the 
female condom for its ability to protect against disease but that 
investigating how well it prevents pregnancy would act as a 
surrogate test for how well it prevents disease 
requiring tests against disease directly is unethical the panel 
said because it would require exposing some women to the risk of 
sexually transmitted diseases 
proposed guidelines were revised during the hearing and panel 
chairwoman dr elizabeth b connell of emory university in atlanta 
said the fda staff will draw up formal regulations connell said the 
advisory panel would meet again to consider the final guidelines 
but she said no date has been set 
in her presentation leeper asked that the condom be approved for 
marketing only as a diseaseprevention device and medical experts 
from johns hopkins university eastern virginia medical school and 
from private medical organizations spoke in favor of this approach 
leeper said the female condom which the company is calling 
wpc333 has been successfully tested on research equipment at the 
university of san francisco and is less likely to fail than the male 
condom

the helicopters weapons and supplies the us 
military is providing colombia will help that nation take its 
antidrug battle into the remote regions where drug traffickers hide 
our military equipment is wellsuited for that purpose it is 
durable and designed to operate in rough terrain army maj david 
super a pentagon spokesman said friday 
while the exact numbers and types of equipment have not been 
completely worked out president bush has decided to send some 65 
million worth of material to help stem the flow of illegal drugs to 
the united states and help colombia battle drug dealers 
no us combat personnel will be sent to colombia officials 
stressed but a small number of us advisers will train colombians 
in the use of the equipment 
there are 112 us government employees in colombia including 36 
military personnel the pentagon said 
the initial 20 million package bush has designated for colombia 
includes some of the roughandtumble type of equipment that us 
forces used in the jungles of vietnam such as the eight uh1 
huey troop transport helicopters 
the choppers which also may be used for ground surveillance can 
be modified to carry two 50caliber machine guns 
they are fast versatile and reliable and can be used to great 
effect to speed up transportation when the roads are bad super 
said of the choppers 
under past foreign military sales agreements the united states 
has sold colombia huey choppers as well as the updated blackhawk 
version which must be flown by colombian pilots 
the colombians can put most of the transportation communications 
and small weapons to work if they carry out raids against the ranch 
headquarters and cocaine processing plants scattered about that 
countrys rough mountainous territory 
included in the first package destined for colombia are machine 
guns mortars ammunition 4wheel drive vehicles ambulances 
communications equipment and antitank guns said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the antitank weapons could be used to blow up entire buildings 
if necessary 
the colombians are also in line to get 12 more hueys a blackhawk 
medical evacuation helicopter assault boats trucks medical 
supplies and airplanes fitzwater said 
although he did not identify which type of fixedwing aircraft 
might be sent the colombians a good candidate would be an a37 a 
small twoperson attack jet that can carry small rockets or bombs 
the colombians already have 18 similar aircraft in their own air 
force and have pilots familiar with such a craft 
the blackhawk helicopter which can be transformed into a medical 
evacuation chopper is the larger modernized version of the older 
huey and can carry twice the payload 
super noted the type of us trainers that will be sent to help 
will depend on the final type of equipment that is shipped to 
colombia 
they may need help maintaining the equipment with mechanics 
or they may request training in tactics map reading or first aid 
any number of things that we could provide super said

the library of congress said today it has 
received 135000 to help restore fire and waterdamaged books in a 
leningrad institution where one of the worst library disasters in 
history occurred 
the gift from readers digest will help experts counter the 
damage at the ussr academy of sciences library whose collection of 
20 million books manuscripts and periodicals was begun in 1714 by 
peter the great 
four million books were damaged or destroyed in a 19hour fire in 
february 1988 
the library of congress is a leader in developing techniques to 
rescue books threatened by decay or disaster 
james h billington librarian of congress and a russian expert 
went to leningrad after the fire to assess the damage and arranged 
for a protocol signed by the two institutions agreeing to preserve 
damaged materials and replace destroyed books 
peter waters a library of congress expert on the conservation of 
damaged book collections went to leningrad within six weeks of the 
fire 
billington welcomed the gift saying in a statement that it 
underscored the principle that library collections are truly 
international resources for humanity which all of us must support 
whenever one of them is threatened by destruction 
the library said the readers digest grant will finance 
equipment supplies and technical consultation to return to use many 
of the 200000 rare volumes that were frozen in an effort to arrest 
deterioration after the fire 
the leningrad institution is one of the worlds largest research 
libraries although not nearly as large as the library of congress 
which holds 86 million items 
the academy library is a major exchange partner for most us 
research libraries that collect russian and soviet materials every 
year several hundred us specialists in russians affairs visit 
there to do research 
a few months after the fire soviet historian and cultural 
activist dmitri likhachev said the disaster could have been 
prevented if officials had heeded warnings about the dilapidated 
condition of the soviet unions most prestigious book collections 
he said it pained him to see how rare books and art treasures 
that were spirited away by residents of leningrad to protect them 
from nazis who occupied the city in world war ii had been destroyed 
through negligence

us rep barney frank says his political 
career is intact but he made a big mistake in hiring a paroled male 
prostitute to do personal chores at his washington home 
frank who disclosed his homosexuality in may 1987 befriended 
and employed the man four years ago after paying him for sex the 
massachusetts democrat fired his employee in august 1987 when he 
suspected the man was selling sex from franks apartment 
certainly if i were a voter i would not ask my advice on how 
to rehabilitate someone frank 49 said during a news conference 
friday at his office in this boston suburb i think i have had 
much better judgment in my public life 
the state republican party called on frank to resign but the 
congressman up for reelection in 1990 said the incident would not 
affect his political career or plans 
i dont think im going to be heavily penalized by the voters 
for being suckered by a guy i was trying to help he said 
some of his colleagues agreed 
house speaker tom foley a democrat said frank has provided 
outstanding service to his constituency and the nation and i am 
absolutely confident he will continue to do so long after this 
matter has been forgotten 
the only other member of congress to acknowledge being 
homosexual rep gerry studds dmass easily won reelection after 
being censured by the house in 1983 for an affair 10 years earlier 
with a 17yearold house page 
after revealing his homosexuality frank won election to his 
fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in the states 4th 
district which encompasses some boston suburbs and parts of 
southeastern massachusetts 
barney frank is on virtually everyones list as one of the 10 
ablest members of congress studds said i suspect he will 
remain on that list for a very long time to come 
franks hiring of the male prostitute was first detailed in 
fridays editions of the washington times 
the newspaper said the man was named greg davis but frank said 
his real name is steve gobie no telephone number was listed for a 
steve gobie in washington or its suburbs 
frank said he met the man in 1985 and estimated his age at 26 or 
27 the congressman admitted paying for sex with the man once but 
said the relationship quickly became one of friendship 
he said he paid gobie to do household chores driving and other 
errands from his own money not congressional or campaign funds the 
total compensation amounted to about 20000 a year including cash 
and payment of lawyer and other bills 
in an interview on wusatv in washington dc a man identifying 
himself as gobie repeated charges that frank was aware of the sexual 
activities at the apartment 
he knew what was taking place he knew there were clients 
coming to his house as long as the clients werent there when he 
was there that was no problem gobie said 
frank called the mans allegations that he was aware of the 
activity absolutely untrue 
alexander tennant executive director of the state gop said 
frank should resign because there are laws against patronizing 
prostitutes 
this is simply a question of a congressman who had the publics 
trust and violated this trust by engaging in illegal activity 
tennant said frank revealed today that he paid for sex 
frank said his only other contact with gobie after the firing in 
august 1987 came in december of that year when gobie called to say 
he was having problems and needed help 
at the hourlong news conference frank refused to answer most 
questions about his sex life but he did say the temptation to pay 
for sex was one of the things that led me to acknowledge being 
gay it was one of the reasons i was vulnerable to being preyed 
on 
he told the associated press that he has now been in a monogamous 
relationship for about two years with a very sensible person and a 
steadying influence

the chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee says a report by federal regulators raises 
conflictofinterest questions regarding the activities of chicago 
board of trade officials during last months soybean emergency 
the commodity futures trading commission which oversees the 
nations futures markets said friday that an initial review of the 
emergency liquidation in the soybean futures market found no 
examples of selfdealing 
but sen patrick leahy the agriculture committee chairman noted 
the report raised possible conflictofinterest questions about 
several of the officials who voted for the forced reduction of 
holdings in july soybean futures contracts 
the cftc must question those chicago board of trade directors 
participating in the july soybean decision whose affiliated firms 
held net short positions in the july soybean contract in house or 
customer accounts said leahy dvt in a statement issued by his 
office 
futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods 
at a specified price at a certain time in the future 
credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their 
selfregulatory functions the public will not tolerate selfdealing 
or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders leahy 
said 
the board of trade the worlds largest commodity exchange 
issued an emergency order last month requiring traders to reduce 
their holdings in soybean futures contracts 
that decision touched off wild swings in soybean prices and 
sparked sharp criticism by farm groups and traders saw the value of 
their futures holdings drop 
those who had sold borrowed soybean futures on speculation the 
price would fall in whats known as a short position stood to gain 
from the emergency order because it resulted in a steep drop in 
soybean prices 
the board of trade has said it took the action after consulting 
with the cftc because a subsidiary of italian grain merchant 
ferruzzi finanziaria spa failed to voluntarily reduce its large 
holdings in the july soybean market 
cbot officials have said the exchange was worried that soybean 
supplies were insufficient for meeting large holdings of contracts 
for july delivery of soybeans in the final days of trading in that 
contract 
the july 11 order requiring traders to reduce their positions in 
the july soybean market to 1 million bushels was widely perceived as 
a move to prevent ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market which 
ferruzzi has denied 
ferruzzi also has bitterly criticized the cbot action 
we continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the 
board to take its emergency action said david swanson an 
executive with ferruzzi group a us subsidiary 
the ferruzzi group supports sen leahys call for further 
investigation by the cftc into the matter said swanson also 
chief executive officer of central soya co 
the cftcs preliminary report was contained in a 36page letter 
to leahy from cftc chairwoman wendy l gramm 
among the preliminary findings the cftcs review disclosed no 
board of trade governing member appeared to trade for the purpose of 
profiting personally or through an affiliated company from prior 
knowledge of the july 11 order 
our position is that even though a firm held a position in the 
july soybean market a director would not be influenced said bot 
spokesman michael oakes

energy secretary james d watkins is balking at 
a request by a federal judge that he testify on what the government 
agreed to in settling a classaction lawsuit over pollution from a 
nuclear weapons plant 
watkins didnt explicitly say he would refuse to appear in the 
court of us district judge s arthur spiegel in cincinnati but 
indicated he would try to avoid it 
my lawyers tell me that its not essential that i am not bound 
by law to comply with that thing watkins said in a meeting friday 
with reporters in his office 
its very difficult for me to be put in that position to 
demand my presence under these circumstances 
the suit was brought by 14000 people who live near the fernald 
ohio weapons plant the residents allege they suffered emotional 
distress and diminished property values as a result of uranium dust 
releases from the plant 
they contend they still have the right to sue for contamination 
cleanup costs but the department which owns the plant says the 
proposed settlement is intended to preclude any further suits over 
cleanup 
the plant known as the feed materials production center is 18 
miles from cincinnati 
spiegel who must approve the proposed settlement said wednesday 
he wanted watkins to testify under oath on his understanding of what 
the settlement entailed 
stanley chesley lawyer for the residents said watkins was 
running the risk of being formally ordered to testify 
adm watkins is picking a fight with the wrong judge chesley 
said 
in a related matter watkins said he would present to president 
bush within two weeks a plan for restoring the nations capability 
to produce a gas needed to make nuclear warheads 
the plan will include a recommendation that three active but 
idled military reactors in south carolina be restarted and run for 
another 15 years to ensure a supply of tritium a radioactive gas 
used to boost warheads explosive power 
watkins provided no details of the plan but he has said he would 
like the first of the savannah river reactors near aiken sc to 
be operating by early next year all three have been under repair 
for more than one year leaving the pentagon with a diminishing 
stockpile of materials for warhead production 
watkins also said he would tell bush the savannah river reactors 
should not be operated beyond 2005 because of uncertainty about 
aging problems 
not one of us would sign on a piece of paper that its smart to 
take those aging reactors beyond that point he said there are 
just too many unknowns 
watkins said congress should move quickly to approve the 
financing for development and construction of two new 
tritiumproducing reactors one at savannah river and one in idaho 
to ensure a continued supply beyond the 1990s the department has 
said the plants can be built in 10 years for 68 billion 
the fragility of the antique reactors at savannah river is 
going to be hanging over our heads like the sword of damocles until 
the year 2005 he said

focus public attention on the worlds underwater environment 
rick sammon president of the sponsoring organization cedam 
international said the selection was the start of an educational 
campaign aimed at preserving the worlds beautiful but very 
fragile marine environment 
if a concerted effort is not undertaken soon to protect and 
preserve our underwater wonders they like the classic seven 
wonders of the world could be lost forever through carelessness 
negligence or deliberate mistreatment he said

a young man from a poor hispanic 
neighborhood who went on to attend harvard university was sentenced 
to 10 years in prison for six armed robberies committed during 
school breaks 
jose luis razo 22 was convicted in june of six robberies and 
attempting to escape police after his 1987 arrest in orange county 
he was found innocent of four other robberies 
hes earned his way to harvard but he also earned his way to 
prison deputy district attorney ravi mehta told the court before 
sentencing mr razo needs to pay his dues to society now mr 
razo needs to be punished for what hes done 
razo also faces trial in los angeles county where he is charged 
with three counts of robbery and six of assault with a deadly weapon 
i have not disregarded the good things i have learned about 
you mr razo orange county superior court judge jean rheinheimer 
said before she sentenced razo on friday this is not a happy 
sentencing for this court 
rheinheimer who could have given him a maximum 15year term was 
asked by the defense to consider razos achievements as a star 
athlete and scholar who gave time to charity 
i dont know how it is that a boy such as jose razo stands 
before this court facing 15 years in state prison said attorney 
john barnett perhaps the gap between the barrio of la habra and 
harvard university was just too wide for him to pass 
but rheinheimer said she could not ignore the fact the crimes 
were premeditated and occurred over a twoyear period showing what 
she called a pattern of conduct dangerous to society 
each of the 10 store robberies committed between december 1985 
and june 1987 occurred during school breaks while he attended 
harvard for two years 
razo sat expressionless friday as the sentence was read his 
tearful parents refused to comment what can we say jose razo 
sr said 
barnett said he planned an appeal 
he called the sentence too severe but added the judge gave 
her honest opinion of what the crimes were worth and what the 
defendant was worth 
with credit for time served and for good behavior razo could be 
eligible for release in about three years mehta said outside court 
razo will then face three years on parole a 500 fine also was 
imposed 
razo was a former high school football star boys club boy of

rep pat schroeder the colorado democrat who 
heads the panel that funds us military bases says the philippines 
will have a long wait coming if they expect large sums of us 
aid 
her comments came as the united states and the philippines 
prepare to start negotiations on renewing six military base leases 
that expire in 1991 many filipino lawmakers are demanding far 
higher us aid in return or a phased withdrawal of american forces 
schroeder just back from a 16day trip to japan the 
philippines taiwan thailand and south korea said the philippines 
wants 2 billion each year 
i told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more 
than double they have a long wait coming she said in a statement 
friday 
her sentiments have been echoed in recent weeks by other 
lawmakers visiting the region over the summer recess 
the united states agreed to pay the philippines some 960 million 
until 1991 but schroeder said she would introduce a bill to sever 
the link between us foreign aid for the philippines and us base 
rights there 
either a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not 
she said 
schroeder also issued a report she commissioned from the general 
accounting office the watchdog agency of congress which said japan 
could save the united states 600 million annually by assuming 
payments in japanese yen for such things as utility bills and 
salaries of japanese workers on the bases 
the report also disputed japans claim that it cannot increase 
support for us forces without renegotiating the 1960 agreement for 
the stationing of american troops there 
the japanese are hiding behind this document and our 
government lets them get away with it schroeder said 
the study praised japan for increasing its share of funding for 
the us forces from 24 percent in 1981 to 31 percent or 17 
billion in 1987 but it said much of the gain resulted from the fact 
that the stronger yen now buys more dollars 
although the increase in japanese support from 1981 to 1987 is 
impressive when measured in us dollars much of it can be 
attributed to the decline of the dollars value against the yen 
the report said 
when measured in dollars japans cash contributions rose 137 
percent but because of the strengthening of the yen the actual 
increase was 44 percent the study found

with the burden of a sheep thrown over his 
shoulder a sculpture of a basque shepherder stands against the 
solitude of a grassy knoll in western nevada 
a figure as if sculpted by the wind itself says an 
inscription on a concrete incline leading to the 22foottall 5ton 
abstract bronze sculpture a man solitary and strong held 
straight by his own will patient laborer facing onto the uncertain 
horizon of adventure 
the sculpture scheduled to be dedicated sunday culminates a 
fouryear 350000 effort by basques in america france and spain 
to erect a us monument to thousands of their countrymen who began 
coming here during the 1850s gold rush to roam the mountains 
keeping watch over sheep 
for 100 years an estimated 95 percent of all shepherds in the 
west were basques who had come to the us with a few dollars and 
worked to amass their own herds eventually owning the largest sheep 
ranches in the united states 
we felt if we didnt do something to honor our heritage what 
brought us all here to this country we would be lost in the melting 
pot of america explained janet inda of reno secretarytreasurer 
of the national basque club 
basque sculptor and noted artist nestor basterretxea said he 
wanted the monument named solitude to capture the loneliness of 
the shepherds life 
i wanted it to look as though it was a stone carved from the 
wind he said thursday through an interpreter as the huge 
sculpture was erected i wanted the shepherder to be part of the 
elements 
gene sullivan director of the washoe county parks department 
said the rancho san rafael park knoll was specifically selected as 
the site of the only monument to basque shepherders in america 
because it used to be a sheep ranch 
there just couldnt be a better place for this sullivan 
said its a typical sheep grazing area 
the reno site also was selected because it is the geographic 
center of the largest population of basques in the united states 
about 90 percent of us basques live in nevada california or 
idaho according to mrs inga 
about 75000 to 100000 americans have basque ancestry basques 
hail from the pyrenees mountains along the border between france and 
spain 
foreign dignitaries including 70 basque nationals have traveled 
to reno for the dedication sunday morning the event coincides with 
the citys annual basque festival which begins today 
the bronze sculpture was cast in mexico city and almost didnt 
make it out of mexico because of red tape 
but prominent nevada basques helped cut the red tape including 
author robert laxalt whose brother paul is a former us senator 
it was held up by the mexican ministry of fine art said 
laxalt adding he used white house contacts to help get it out of 
the country earlier this week the ministry of fine art released the 
sculpture after authorities were assured it wasnt a mexican 
national treasure 
this has been a fouryear effort to memorialize the only 
forgotten stereotype in the building of the early west laxalt 
said you have the pony express riders the miners and the 
cowboys but the shepherders always were low profile and lived in 
solitude

after eight years of guerrilla war the 
usbacked contra rebels who fought to topple nicaraguas 
sandinista government will begin disbanding in less than two weeks 
the secretarygeneral of the organization of american states 
joao clemente baena soares of brazil and un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar announced friday that work will begin sept 
6 
perez de cuellar met with nicaraguan foreign minister miguel 
descoto brockmann to discuss resettling the estimated 11000 to 
12000 nicaraguan rebels now based in honduras 
upon learning that dates had been fixed for the demobilization of 
the contras descoto said that is very good news we have wanted 
that for a very long time 
i would imagine that the vast majority of the people would want 
to come home even some of the miami contras have returned said 
descoto 
under an agreement signed aug 7 by the presidents of nicaragua 
el salvador honduras costa rica and guatemala the ussupported 
contras are to repatriated or resettled in other countries 
the tela declaration calls for the rebels to be resettled by dec 
5 
numerous contra field commanders and guerrillas have said they 
will not give up their fight 
however a un diplomat active in central american affairs said 
preliminary talks with the rebels indicate they are quite willing to 
go home or be resettled and that little resistance is expected 
disarming and resettling the contras will require a new un 
peacekeeping force said the diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the world bodys experts believe the size and cost of such a 
force can be minimized if the contras are disarmed over a period of 
months in small groups rather than rounded up and disarmed at once 
he said 
the united states had lobbied the central american nations to 
allow the contras to stay in their border camps in honduras until 
national elections are held in nicaragua on feb 25 to maintain 
pressure on the sandinistas to allow a fair campaign 
even honduras however which has received lavish military and 
foreign aid from washington agreed earlier this month that there 
was no justification to allow the contras to remain until then 
the united states gives the contras 45 million a month in 
nonlethal aid which may also be used for resettlement 
congress cut off money for weapons last year the contras later 
negotiated a truce with the sandinistas and since then have launched 
only sporadic raids 
perez de cuellar also met friday with el salvadors foreign 
minister jose manuel pacas castro 
el salvador wants its central american neighbors to turn their 
attention on disbanding the leftist rebel force trying to topple its 
government a goal the us government shares 
the joint unoas statement alluded to that aim by saying 
efforts will be made to disband and resettle all those involved in 
armed actions in the countries of the region when they voluntarily 
seek it 
the salvadoran rebels are the faribundo marti liberation front 
known by its spanish acronym as the fmln

maybe its just her imagination 
but janice evans swears the train rumbling by her home has been 
louder since those hellish days in may when a train derailment was 
followed by a fiery pipeline explosion 
its like you stop every time the train passes to make sure 
nothings happening during the night its just twice as loud 
said mrs evans one of dozens of residents still looking for 
explanations and blame for the twin disasters 
beginning monday some of their questions may be answered when 
the national transportation safety board begins five days of 
hearings into the may 12 derailment of a southern pacific freight 
train and the may 25 explosion of a calnev pipe line co gasoline 
line near the tracks 
the two disasters killed six people and destroyed 15 homes 
focusing new attention on pipeline safety the ntsb hearing is 
intended to gather information to help the board determine a cause 
of the disasters and to make recommendations to prevent further 
accidents said board spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
the board will pursue how workers calculated the load weight on 
the train the quality of locomotive brakes the cleanup of train 
wreckage near the calnev pipeline and the effectiveness of check 
valves in the line 
a final report with the probable cause is expected in at least 
six months 
in the meantime were just kind of in limbo said mrs evans 
whose house escaped serious damage but who continues to see a 
psychologist to help her deal with the emotional trauma caused by 
the disasters 
the ntsb hearing marks the latest in a series of public hearings 
probing the disasters 
in earlier sessions government officials called the nations 
pipeline safety programs inadequate while industry officials 
responded by pointing to the industrys relatively good safety 
record 
some of the sharpest criticism of the governments role in 
pipeline safety has come from democratic lawmakers who say 
regulators are burdened by staff shortages outofdate equipment 
and a tangle of weak and confusing laws 
the states pipeline safety division which acts as the federal 
governments surrogate in pipeline regulation employs 12 people to 
oversee thousands of miles of lines 
officials acknowledged that for several hours after the 
derailment they didnt even know of the existence of the duffy 
street pipeline which supplies 90 percent of las vegas gas and 
nearly all the jet fuel to george and edwards air force bases 
the federal office of pipeline safety said the calnev line may 
not have exploded after the train derailment had authorities been 
given the power to order a pressure test on the line to search out 
leaks and weak spots calnev did not perform the test saying it did 
not appear necessary at the time 
three check valves in the pipeline uphill from the rupture failed 
to close after the blast and gasoline flowed back into the flames 
ntsb inspectors found 
investigators discovered that the valves had not been inspected 
or maintained since they were installed along with the pipeline in 
1970 
calnev has since inspected its valves and taken other steps in 
the wake of disasters said spokesman richard kline 
calnev like other pipeline companies vigorously defends its 
practices by pointing to its safety record which shows that 
carrying fuel through pipelines is considerably safer than carrying 
fuel in tanker trucks or railroad cars

party under indictment in connection with a spy case said today he 
is launching a campaign to get his prosecutor fired and to force the 
government to expedite reform 
kim daejung head of the party for peace and democracy said it 
will battle the government in the national assembly the courts and 
among the people to speed democratic reforms and wipe out legacies 
of past authoritarian regimes 
there are over 900 political prisoners in jail this is more 
than were jailed at any one time under the chun doohwan regime 
he said referring to the predecessor of president roh taewoo 
speaking at a news conference prior to a rally in the western 
port of inchon kim said the indictment against him is tantamount 
to the government of roh taewoo declaring it has given up its 
willingness to carry out reforms toward democracy

to report the illegal visit to north korea by national assemblyman 
suh kyungwon 
suh has been jailed on charges of violating national security

surrendered to authorities june 25 and was formally charged and 
expelled from the party three days later for a trip made in august

north korea which south korea has considered an enemy since the 
peninsula was divided in 1945 the two koreas fought a war in 
195053 but a peace treaty was never signed 
kim who ran for president in 1971 and 1987 has denied he had 
prior knowledge of suhs trip or espionage and says the government 
has purposely harassed the opposition party to discredit and 
embarrass it among voters 
he said his party will introduce a resolution in the national 
assembly seeking the dismissal of prosecutor general kim kichun in 
charge of investigating the case and will call for televised 
hearings on democratic reform 
in september he said the party will begin a nationwide petition 
drive to press demands for democratization and will hold rallies in 
27 cities to denounce political suppression 
kim charged that tortures are practiced widely even though the 
constitution guarantees the rights of suspects to be assisted by 
counsel kim claimed suh had been physically tortured for 50 days 
by being allowed to sleep only in brief intervals and enduring 
interrogations standing 
he said others have had to endure similar torture

education while others used their cars for personal pleasure and 
profit the daily reported many of the offices registered their 
cars in the names of individuals or army units

technology they can use for modernizing their countrys stagnant 
economy especially in the vast underdeveloped stretches of eastern 
siberia 
vladislav malkevich chairman of the soviet chamber of commerce

to defense technology that has been declassified in keeping with the 
reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev 
what is at issue is certainly not joint ss20 missile 
production malkevich told a friday news conference but many of

police searched for an 18yearold suspect and 
put bulletproof vests on five young white men subjected to death 
threats after they were charged with participating in a fatal racial 
attack 
the five were charged friday in the death of yusef hawkins 16 
who was shot wednesday night when he and three friends all black 
went to the mostly white bensonhurst neighborhood of brooklyn to try 
to buy a used car 
police said hawkins and his friend ran into a gang of 10 to 30 
young people armed with baseball bats and at least one gun in rage 
against interracial dating 
parallels to the 1986 howard beach case deepened as it emerged 
that one of hawkins companions luther sylvester 17 is a cousin 
of michael griffith griffith was chased to his death in howard 
beach by a gang of white teenagers angry that blacks entered their 
neighborhood 
as condemnation mounted from civil rights leaders and candidates 
in this years city elections police announced a 10000 reward for 
information leading to other arrests and convictions in the case 
the new york times and the daily news reported in their saturday 
editions that witnesses identified an 18yearold as the gunman and 
that he was the subject of an intensive manhunt officially police 
said only that a sixth youth was wanted for questioning 
the suspects charged friday were led out of a police station 
wearing bulletproof vests 
an anonymous caller had told a desk sergeant that they were 
going to get those guys as soon as they left the station 
inspector richard mayronne said 
police said the racial tragedy resulted from the anger of a young 
man who was jilted by a girlfriend who began dating a darkskinned 
hispanic man the gang gathered to waylay black or hispanics youths 
they thought were coming to the neighborhood to attend gina 
felicianos 18th birthday party 
miss feliciano fearing trouble had called off the party and 
the white youths attacked hawkins and his friends sylvester 
stanford 18 and troy banner 18 
keith mondello 18 who police say was miss felicianos former 
boyfriend steven curreri 18 pasquale raucci 19 and charles 
stressler 21 were charged with assault riot aggravated 
harassment violation of civil rights and menacing and possessing a 
weapon a baseball bat mondello and curreri also were charged with 
conspiracy 
james patino 24 was charged with assault riot aggravated 
harassment and violation of civil rights 
police who impounded modellos car and opened it after waiting 
for a search warrant said they found a bat inside but no gun 
figures who played key roles in the howard beach drama also 
entered the bensonhurst case within hours of the shooting 
stephen murphy the lawyer who won the only acquittal among the 
major howard beach defendants is representing one of the white 
brooklyn youths c vernon mason who as attorney for one of the 
howard beach survivors forced appointment of a special prosecutor 
is representing stanford 
murphy said mondello was not the boyfriend jilted by miss 
feliciano he said mondello conceded being at the scene and having a 
bat but maintained the youth was armed to protect himself against 
the girls threat that her black and hispanic friends would beat him 
up 
police said miss feliciano was cooperating with the investigation 
david dinkins the only black candidate in the sept 12 mayoral 
primary condemned the racism underlying the attack by saying it 
wasnt mistaken identity it was a case of any nigger will do 
the new york urban league renewed its call for appointment of a 
permanent special prosecutor for bias crimes the league president 
donald polk also proposed setting up sting operations in 
neighborhoods with histories or recent incidents of racially 
motivated harassment or violence 
we in new york are once again confronted with an unacceptable 
racial disaster another intolerable incident of racial 
violence said norman siegel executive director of the new york

wilkesbarre pa ap the parents of a 14yearold boy never 
meant for their oldest child to die believing throughout a 42day 
fast that the lord would save them from a financial crisis their 
attorney said 
larry and leona cottam accused of murder in the starving death 
of their son eric had hoped their faith would sustain them through 
hard times defense attorney al flora said during opening statements 
friday in the cottams trial in luzerne county court 
flora said the couple and their 12yearold daughter laura were 
shocked when they found eric dead jan 3 at their home in nearby 
nuangola 
they never believed anyone would die and they thought god would 
intervene flora said 
mrs cottam wept quietly throughout the opening arguments while 
her husband a former minister in the seventhday adventist church 
sat stoically beside her 
after erics death his parents and sister were hospitalized for 
malnutrition the family went without food for six weeks despite 
having saved 3775 they said was a tithe belonging to god police 
said 
the 5foot9inch teenager weighed 69 pounds when he died 
in other statements flora said the cottams did not seek help 
because authorities did nothing years earlier when the couple 
learned their children had been sexually molested he said they were 
too scared to turn to outsiders because they were afraid the 
children would be taken from them and hurt 
the evidence will show more than anything else they feared the 
very thing we look to for help flora said 
assistant district attorney ann cianflone told the jury brought 
from philadelphia because of pretrial publicity that the family 
wanted to eat she said eric had tried to stay alive by eating roots 
from the back yard and hiding a frying pan and oil in his bedroom 
all the evidence will show that for a sixweek period of time 
larry and leona cottam did nothing to get out of the situation they 
were in she said 
they did not call for help they did not call for assistance 
until after eric cottam had died 
flora suggested during his opening arguments that the cottam 
children had been sexually molested sometime during late 1983 or 
early 1984 when they attended a oneroom churchaffiliated school 
the cottams had enrolled their children in the school which had 
only five other students at the time when they moved to luzerne 
county after larry cottam had been assigned to be the pastor of four 
area churches 
flora said the couple became concerned after laura began 
screaming in the middle of the night and would awaken crying and 
trembling the couple pulled their children from the school 
it was only after the couple moved to pittsburgh where larry 
cottam became pastor of another church that they learned of the 
reasons behind lauras nightmares flora said 
flora said the cottams sought medical treatment for the children 
and at the urging of hospital officials contacted state and luzerne 
county law enforcement officials for help 
when authorities didnt take action for several months the 
cottams decided to retreat from the outside world flora said 
they moved back to luzerne county teaching their children at 
home and turning to god for help from financial problems when 
cottam lost his job as a truck driver flora said

a state appeals court overturned the murder 
convictions of three men in an alleged gaybashing ruling that 
the evidence failed to justify the convictions 
the 1st district court of appeal said friday that no murderous 
blows were struck before the victims head fatally struck the 
pavement the court said the man was struck twice slapped and 
probably punched 
the attack was unprovoked and seems clearly to have been 
motivated solely by the three mens mindless homophobia said 
justice william newsom in the appeals courts 21 ruling 
the court cited the legal standard for murder when no intent to 
kill is shown acting deliberately and in disregard for human life 
a person must commit an act that is inherently lifethreatening 
that standard cannot be met by a beating unless it is so brutal 
that death is a probable consequence said newsom 
the court ordered the convictions reduced to involuntary 
manslaughter a death resulting from an ordinary assault with a 
maximum sentence of four years 
if upheld the ruling would reduce the mens convictions from 
seconddegree murder to involuntary manslaughter lawyers for two of 
the men said they would be eligible for immediate release from 
prison where they have been since 1984 on sentences of 15 years to 
life 
any antigay behavior is despicable and people should be 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law said maureen kallins 
lawyer for defendant timothy white but this was never a murder 
tim white slapped someone and a slap does not make him a 
murderer 
deputy attorney general blair hoffman said there was a good 
chance the state would appeal the ruling he said it was a close 
question whether the mens actions were lifethreatening a 
requirement for a murder conviction but that the appeals court 
should have let the jury resolve the issue 
white then 22 and codefendants donny clanton 19 and david 
rogers 19 had driven 40 miles to san francisco from their homes in 
vallejo a witness quoted rogers as saying lets go beat up some 
faggots 
the men went to an area of san francisco frequented by 
homosexuals and pursued two passersby one john oconnell 41 was 
struck and knocked to the sidewalk he went into a coma and died 
days later the court said the cause of death was the impact of his 
head on the pavement 
the killing and several other assaults to which the men pleaded 
guilty prompted a public outcry then mayor dianne feinstein posted 
a 10000 reward in the case and a state law was passed increasing 
damages in suits by victims of gaybashing

leader fw de klerk pledged cooperation but reported no 
breakthroughs in talks aimed at rescuing a faltering peace agreement 
in angola 
de klerk on his first diplomatic mission since he became acting 
president aug 15 conferred for nearly three hours friday with 
mobutu at his resort home on the shores of lake kivu in northeastern 
zaire 
a joint communique described the talks as positive opportune 
and constructive particularly at this critical state of 
developments in angola 
the statement said the leaders agreed on the need for more 
discussions they refused to answer any questions at a lakeside 
luncheon following the talks 
the angolan government and the rebels agreed june 22 to a 
ceasefire brokered by mobutu but the opposing sides have 
repeatedly accused each other of violations rebel leader jonas 
savimbi said thursday that the truce was over and told his forces 
to prepare for further fighting 
an official close to fridays discussions who requested 
anonymity suggested south africa and zaire would try to keep the 
peace process alive by serving as intermediaries between angolas 
marxist government and the usbacked guerrilla movement 
mobutu has been leading efforts to negotiate a settlement of 
angolas civil war and south africa endorsed his initiative after 
halting military assistance to the guerrillas last year 
de klerk is to meet zambian president kenneth kaunda in 
livingstone zambia on monday a scheduled trip that led to his 
appointment as acting president after pw botha resigned in anger 
over the plans 
as leader of south africas ruling national party de klerk is 
favored to win election to a fiveyear term as president after 
parliamentary elections sept 6 
the guerrilla group the national union for the total 
independence of angola has been fighting since 1975 for a 
powersharing agreement with the angolan government 
the united states supplies the rebels with about 15 million in 
aid annually and routes supplies through zaire 
the angolan government and the rebels said friday that more than 
200 people had died in fighting this past week in central and 
southern angola the casualty toll was one of the highest reported 
since a ceasefire was declared in angola in june

killed 77 government soldiers who attacked rebel positions earlier 
this week

polish communists may have suffered a defeat but 
nobody should write their political obituary the soviet communist 
party daily pravda said today in what appeared to be a warning to 
polish radicals 
with the election of soldarity member tadeusz mazowiecki as 
polish prime minister pravda said extremistminded people are 
hurrying to write off the polish united workers party because they 
argue it has finally found itself in isolation abandoned by its 
associates 
that would be premature pravda cautioned in fact it said the 
communists by right are the most important group in polish politics 
one should not ignore the fact that the puwp a more than 
2millionstrong party of communists remains the leading force of 
society and has always worked and acted for the good of the people 
repeatedly led the country out of deep crises and been a herald of 
all progressive reforms the soviet paper said 
mazowieckis election on thursday with the support of many 
communist lawmakers gave the soviet union and their east bloc 
allies the first noncommunist chief of government in the region 
since world war ii 
mazowiecki was chosen after parliamentary elections in which 
communist candidates were trounced and after a communist prime 
minister was unable to form a government in the face of opposition 
from the solidarity labor movement 
the soviet government sent an immediate telegram of 
congratulations to mazowiecki but pravdas commentary the most 
authoritative to date cast doubt on whether mazowiecki can succeed 
in breaking polands economic decline 
is this the way out of the labyrinth the newspaper asked in 
a headline it never really answered the question 
the kremlin has repeatedly said polish politics are purely a 
matter for poles to decide but pravda gave a picture of events in 
the soviet unions western neighbor that must have seemed quite 
familiar to soviets who have seen promises of political reform at 
home accompanied by food shortages and unrest 
and yet the polish communist party has not been discouraged 
has not given up its lofty and necessary mission to renew socialism 
to achieve national concord and to reform the economy pravda said

the austria press agency quoted unidentified law enforcement 
officials in eisenstadt near the border as saying the east germans 
crossed into austria overnight individually or in small family 
groups 
that marked a change from recent mass escape attempts 
hungary announced friday that it would increase its contingent of 
border guards because they have been overwhelmed by up to 500 
escapees at a time 
the flight of politically and economically disenchanted east 
germans into austria began after hungary tore down most of the 
barriers on its side of the border in may the move was welcomed in 
the west as a sign of liberalization in hungary one of the soviet 
blocs most reformminded countries 
but it has led to tensions with east germany which has declined 
to follow the east bloc reform movement which began in the soviet 
union 
west german officials estimate that since july 5000 east germans 
with little chance of legal travel to the west have used hungary a 
warsaw pact ally that they can visit freely as an illegal transit 
point to the west 
west germany which welcomes all east germans immigrants has 
exerted pressure on hungary as well calling for a humane solution 
to the problem 
hundreds of east germans also are refusing to leave west german 
diplomatic property in budapest hungary prague czechoslovakia 
and east berlin unless they are guaranteed safe passage to west 
germany

syrian and christian gunners battled with 
howitzers today but a police spokesman said the clashes had 
slackened since a soviet envoy started a bid to secure a stable 
ceasefire 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules said 
four hours of predawn shelling subsided after 7 am into 
intermittent exchanges of machine gunfire and 60mm mortar rounds 
across the citys dividing green line 
he said two people were killed and nine wounded in the artillery 
duel which also targeted christian ports north of the city and 
syrian gun emplacements in moslem west beirut 
the cyprus government today halted daily flights by military 
helicopter between cyprus and lebanons besieged christian enclave 
sources reported 
a lebanese embassy source speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the ban and called it a temporary measure 
the cyprus government declined comment but one source said the 
ban was imposed because lebanon violated an agreement to use the 
flights for humanitarian purposes only and was using them to carry 
christian military personnel 
the helicopter flights and a daily hydrofoil service between the 
christian port of jounieh and the cypriot port of larnaca next to 
the airport have been the christian enclaves only links with the 
outside world 
by police count 796 people have been killed and 2231 wounded 
since the fighting began march 8 between christian army commander 
gen michel aouns troops and syrian forces backed by moslem militia 
allies 
the spokesman said the intensity of the syrianchristian 
clashes has diminished noticeably since soviet envoy gennady 
tarasov arrived wednesday on a mission to halt the latest round of 
violence in lebanons 14yearcivil war 
tarasov who heads the soviet foreign ministrys middle east 
department talked with aoun and moslem lebanese leaders before 
leaving friday for damascus for meetings with syrian officials 
syria a close soviet ally claims to be in full agreement with 
moscow over lebanon which it considers within its sphere of 
influence but tarasovs talks with aoun contradicted the syrian 
refusal to accept the maronite catholic general as a negotiating 
partner 
aoun has declared a war of liberation against syria he says 
syrias 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate have betrayed their mission by fighting on the 
moslem side 
tarasov said after meeting aoun on friday the soviet union 
strongly believes there are no military solutions to the lebanese 
problems 
a source close to aoun speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the general told tarasov of his full readiness to cooperate with 
the soviet effort on lebanon 
he said the soviet envoy was working on a formula accepted to 
all for stabilizing the security situation and lifting the 
blockade imposed by syria on the 310squaremile christian enclave 
north of beirut 
syria and its allies laid siege to the enclave in retaliation for 
aouns march 6 blockade of illegal militiarun ports south of beirut 
aimed at retrieving lost taxes estimated at 100 million annually 
a senior moslem official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said tarasov offered soviet guarantees covering the security part 
of a plan to defuse the situation and address the political crisis 
lebanons moslems who make up a majority of the countrys 
population are seeking political reform guaranteeing an equal share 
of power with the traditionally dominant christians 
the moslem official said the soviet mission focused on reviving a 
threemember arab league mediation committees peace effort in 
lebanon 
the committee comprising leaders of morocco saudi arabia and 
algeria said july 28 it had reached an impasse because syria 
refused to agree to setting a timetable for pulling its troops out 
of lebanon 
syrianchristian clashes escalated sharply after the committees 
report which aoun considered a victory for his cause 
the moslem source said the soviet diplomatic effort did not 
contradict the deployment of a flotilla of french warships in the 
eastern mediterranean off the lebanese coast 
the soviet effort is the carrot and the french naval buildup is 
the stick the source said 
he added that the french naval presence is a message to the 
syrians and their allies that storming through the christian 
enclave is not permitted 
it is the same message that tarasov delivered at the diplomatic 
level he saidl 
there have been reports the syrians and moslems militias were 
planning to launch massive ground attacks against the enclave home 
to about 1 million christians

israel has set up a committee to investigate the 
possible involvement of its private security companies in training 
murder squads for colombias drug cartels a senior foreign ministry 
official said today 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu speaking on israel 
radio said israel was not asked to conduct an investigation either 
by colombia or by the united states but has offered its cooperation 
to both countries 
two days ago we asked the colombian government at the request 
of foreign minister moshe arens for any information available to 
them and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do 
netanyahu said 
on friday an israeli reserve officer denied reports he was 
involved in training death squads for colombian drug lords saying 
instead he was an instructor for a group of cattle breeders fighting 
leftist guerrillas 
israel television and all of the countrys major dailies last 
week identified lt col yair klein as the head of a group of four 
israeli army reserve colonels who allegedly helped train 
paramilitary troops and assassination teams in colombia 
klein 44 a retired commander of a paratroop antiterror unit 
and president of a private security firm called spearhead was 
identified in israel on the basis of film broadcast by nbc 
i trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against 
terrorist organizations mostly the group called m19 a guerrilla 
group with the goal of turning colombia into cuba or nicaragua 
klein told national television friday 
a senior defense ministry official said klein probably will be 
questioned about his activities in colombia klein returned to 
israel on friday from the united states the television said 
netanyahu has said israel may revoke the passports of any israeli 
mercenaries proven to be involved in the training of death squads 
for colombian drug lords 
israel he said had set up an interdepartmental committee to 
look into this in the foreign ministry and other offices of the 
government 
klein said four spearhead instructors started to train a group of 
cattle breeders 18 months ago he said the training lasted for six 
months and the film was a concluding film of the training 
this group included only farmers who have been physically 
injured by guerrilla bullets and survived or had their families 
killed nobody else was accepted into this organization he said 
klein said the organization enjoyed the tacit support of the 
colombian government the first meeting with the group was preceded 
by a meeting in bogota that included a deputy government minister 
two senior officers and a representative of a bank 
he said military equipment and ammunition was used during the 
training which was conducted in full view of an army camp 
the colombian government cannot say it did not know anything 
about our training of such a group i estimate it was interested in 
such bodies being trained to solve the guerrilla problem klein 
said 
he said he was convinced that the group spearhead trained was not 
involved in drugs but he left open the possibility that it was 
doing so secretly 
on thursday the israeli defense ministry said in an official 
statement that spearhead has been denied a permit and operated 
illegally in colombia 
it said a second firm which it did not identify had violated 
terms of a permit to do security work in colombia but that no link 
to illegal activities had been established 
klein responded that he did not have a permit to work with 
official bodies but didnt need one to work with private groups 
he said spearhead entered colombia with the help of an israeli 
company that provided security services for the banana plantation 
owners union he declined to identify the company 
klein said his firm ended contacts with the group when we felt 
we were not needed and had a feeling the government started to 
ignore the body we trained 
the israelis he said were replaced by two mercenaries from 
scotland one from the united states and one from south africa he 
said the organization may later have gotten involved in drugs 
i estimate there is no organization today in colombia that is 
not linked to drugs from the government downwards klein said

crack seizures in western europe amount to a few 
ounces a year a tiny haul alongside the us flood but many 
europeans are getting worried 
crack is the specter i see hanging over europe britains 
home secretary douglas hurd told delegates of the 23nation 
council of europe whom he invited to london in may to discuss drug 
abuse 
our job must be to work together urgently to ensure that the 
united states experience is not repeated here he said 
britain is the only european country already battling a crack 
problem but with cracks parent drug cocaine flowing into europe 
alongside horrifying images of cracks impact in the united states 
vigilance is increasing 
interpol the parisbased international police agency now 
monitors all crack seizures rather than only those of over 100 
grams or 35 ounces 
agents of the drug enforcement agency have held a workshop to 
teach italians how to spot il crack and the problem is likely 
to be high on the agendas of two major drug conferences 
crack is a smokeable derivative of cocaine that gives an instant 
intense high as the drug goes straight to the brain but wears 
off in a few minutes leaving a lingering deep depression 
but europeans are divided over the size of the wolf at the door 
the dutch predict they wont even have a problem others doubt crack 
could find the home in europe that it has in the united states 
where crime and drug abuse rates are higher 
west german police have seized so little that they are not 
keeping track swedish police say they have heard of its use but 
havent seized any the swiss confiscated two grams in 1988 spain 
and italy have seized none 
the general rule is that europe is four to six years behind the 
states says gerhard neurohr head of interpols cocaine division 
of course every rule has its exceptions and crack may be an 
exception 
but then remember angel dust slang for phenyl cyclohexyl 
piperidine a powerful psychedelic drug it swept the united states 
and everybody waited in europe for an angel dust wave that never 
happened 
nowhere is the debate more heated than in britain which had 31 
crack seizures in the first six months of 1989 and 27 in the same 
period last year british authorities say they seized 102 grams 
about 36 ounces between january 1987 and june 1989 68 grams or 
24 ounces of it in the first half of this year 
although the number of seizures is still small they have been 
quite widespread with crack found in many of our major cities 
hurd told another privately sponsored crack conference in july 
problem users have appeared in the last 15 months in south 
london says steve tippell who heads a counseling center there and 
is touring us cities to study their responses 
because of cracks high cost here tippell says most users in the 
british capital make their own crack which is easy to convert from 
cocaine a rock of two smokes costs 30 to 40 double the price 
in the united states 
interpol says crack seizures in europe total 600 grams about 22 
ounces since 1986 although british drug experts say this might not 
include small amounts seized 
cocaine seizures on the other hand rose from 345 pounds in 1978 
to almost six tons last year in europe exceeding the heroin haul 
for the first time interpol says 
we were caught napping when heroin first arrived in the early 
70s says hans lundborg narcotics bureau chief at swedens 
ministry for social affairs the government cant afford to make 
that same mistake again 
britain is emphasizing education and treatment rather than 
allout attempts to stop suppliers 
the americans are quite clear that if they would have their 
time over again they would have given more emphasis to prevention 
work says hurd 
he told the council of europe meeting that britain will increase 
annual funding for education and teacher training to 11 million 
and provide extra cash for drug treatment and un drug programs 
britain also will host an international conference next year on 
fighting drugs especially crack and the european parliament and 
commission will hold a similar meeting in the spring 
i am convinced that crack is on its way says sir jack 
stewartclark a british european parliament lawmaker helping 
organize the parliament meeting 
the american situation today is likely to be the european 
situation tomorrow with some slight differences he said in a 
telephone interview 
a nonpartisan group of british lawmakers returning alarmed from 
a study trip to the united states called for targeting demand by 
setting up usstyle helplines and a national public awareness 
campaign 
despite his strong statements hurd rejects a national campaign 
against crack saying this would advertise the drug 
ministers recall a national drive against heroin several years 
ago that was widely believed to have glamorized the drug 
to portray crack sensationally as uniquely diabolical will only 
add to its allure wrote addiction experts john strang and 
griffith edwards in an aug 5 british medical journal editorial 
but dave turner director of an umbrella group of drug 
organizations says some of the hype about crack and cocaine is 
important in order to put pressure on the government 
interpols neurohr also cites the high cost of crack in europe as 
well as a different mentality toward cocaine as reasons why europe 
may not be too badly affected 
in the states crack is a cheap drug for social underdogs he 
told the associated press in europe social underdogs drink 
alcohol or shoot heroin or take amphetamines 
people here are wellinformed even drug addicts discuss the 
dangers of crack

the government on saturday rejected an 
appeal from the orthodox church of greece for release of military 
rulers held in jail since their junta collapsed in 1974 
the holy synod which acts as the churchs ruling body made the 
unprecedented request friday 
it said the former dictators should be freed in appreciation of 
the optimistic spirit currently being cultivated for the more 
general reconciliation of the greeks and the forgetting of past 
misfortunes and divisions 
however government spokesman athanassios kanellopoulos said 
the government was never concerned with the subject and it does 
not comment on holy synod announcements 
the current government is made up of an alliance of leftists and 
conservatives 
the military which seized power in april 1967 was toppled in 
july 1974 after it engineered an abortive coup in cyprus the 
attempt led to a turkish invasion of the northern part of the 
mediterranean island 
the rightwing military dictatorship was responsible for the 
widespread detention and torture of political opponents and the 
suppression of a student uprising in november 1973 
three former junta leaders were sentenced to death in august 
1975 but their sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment 
another eight were given life terms

a university of michigan policy aimed at 
cutting discriminatory harassment on campus is unconstitutional a 
federal judge ruled 
university officials proposed the policy last year after assorted 
racist acts including a widely publicized incident in which a 
student disc jockey on a campus radio show allowed a caller to tell 
antiblack jokes 
us district judge avern cohn ruled friday that the policy 
violates freedom of speech and was so vague that persons of common 
intelligence must guess at its meaning 
the ruling likely will have national significance said howard 
simon executive director of the american civil liberties union in 
michigan which challenged the policy on behalf of an unidentified 
michigan student 
universities from duke to stanford and wisconsin and in between 
are faced with these same kinds of problems and are considering 
similar policies to the university of michigan simon said 
the policy barred harassment or discrimination based on race 
ethnicity religion sex sexual orientation creed national 
origin ancestry age marital status handicap or vietnamveteran 
status the aclu did not challenge a part of the policy that bars 
physical acts of harassment 
the policy is clearly wellintentioned the university needs 
to address problems of harmful racism on campus but the method by 
which they chose to do so assaults the principles of free speech and 
freedom of expression simon said 
the judge has forced them to go back to the drawing board and 
develop a policy that doesnt violate free speech but protects 
students from harassment he said the judge performed a public 
service 
the universitys general counsel elsa kircher cole said she was 
disappointed by the ruling 
we had very carefully crafted a policy that would recognize 
first amendment rights of students while addressing the very serious 
problems of racial and sexual harassment on campus cole said 
cole said the university had begun reviewing the policy before 
cohn held a hearing on it friday and now will decide whether to 
rewrite it or appeal the judges ruling 
a majority of michigan board of regents had favored the policy 
but regent deane baker said he glad it was struck down 
my own belief is that people on campus should be completely 
free to speak as they wish baker said one might not agree with 
what is said but if there is any place where we should have free 
speech it is our universities where we seek to find truth

a political leader indicted in a north 
korean spy case said saturday he will try rally the countrys 
splintered opposition forces for a new campaign to push government 
reforms 
kim daejung of the party for peace and democracy said his 
indictment is tantamount to the government of president roh 
taewoo declaring it has given up its willingness to carry out 
reforms toward democracy 
kim who heads the largest opposition party vowed to battle the 
government in the national assembly and the courts to speed 
democratic reforms and wipe out legacies of past authoritarian 
regimes 
there are over 900 political prisoners in jail this is more 
than were jailed at any one time under the chun doohwan regime 
he said referring to rohs predecessor in remarks at a news 
conference 
kim told a news conference that his party would introduce a 
resolution in the national assembly to fire prosecutor general kim 
kichun he is supervising the case against kim 
addressing an outdoor rally of 20000 supporters in the western 
port of inchon later on saturday kim pledged to launch the 
strongest possible antigovernment campaign 
kim and two other members of his party were indicted friday they 
were accused of failing to report to authorities about an illegal 
visit to north korea by national assemblyman suh kyungwon then a 
member of kims party 
suh has been jailed on charges of violating national security 
laws espionage and accepting 120000 from agents of the communist 
country 
the opposition leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 
1971 and 1987 has denied prior knowledge of suhs trip in august 
1988 kim has said the government is attacking him an an effort to 
discredit the political opposition 
if convicted kim could face up to five years in prison 
kim said his party will begin a nationwide petition drive in 
september to press for more democracy and will organize rallies in 
27 cities to denounce political repression he said his party will 
join its efforts with those of other dissident forces 
kim youngsam who heads the opposition reunification democratic 
party criticized the indictment of the rival party leader 
the suh case should be thoroughly investigated but it is 
nonsense to indict the head of an opposition party simply for 
failing to report it to authorities he told a news conference 
his group is the secondlargest opposition party both kims ran 
for president in 1987 during a feud among opposition forces 
splitting the opposition vote and allowing roh to win the presidency 
without a majority 
national security laws forbid unauthorized travel to north korea 
which south korea has viewed as an enemy country since the peninsula 
was divided in 1945 the two koreas fought a war in 195053 and 
never signed a peace treaty 
in another development about 350 radical students and families 
of political prisoners held a peaceful rally at korea university in 
seoul to denounce the roh government they accused authorities of 
stepping up persecution of political dissenters 
government officials deny holding any political prisoners

a sustained drug crackdown in colombia could 
eventually cut the flow of cocaine into the united states but 
traffickers have too much money and too many tricks to be deterred 
in the near future 
in the long term we may see a considerable reduction said 
charles j gutensohn chief of cocaine investigations for the drug 
enforcement administration but the problem is the cocaine is 
already in the pipeline and more people are using crack which 
uses less cocaine 
colombian drug traffickers process and ship most of the worlds 
cocaine to the united states colombias government following the 
murder of presidential hopeful carlos galan intensified its war on 
drugs by confiscating 200 million in property and making mass 
arrests last week 
in a show of support the united states on friday offered a 65 
million aid package to help colombia with its crackdown 
traffickers however buoyed by the big bucks and the ready 
market in the united states have been hard to stop many top 
dealers are millionaires and one official pointed out that pilots 
many of them americans can make hundreds of thousands of dollars 
for a single flight in a cocaineladen plane 
they are cagey gutensohn said of the traffickers they are 
people who have a lot of money and they can pay ohers to take 
chances 
in addition the colombians could shift their operations to 
isolated areas in neighboring countries brazil peru or bolivia 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that us 
officials are concerned about that possibility 
robert strang a dea special agent in new york city said 
colombian traffickers in the united states sell their wares in large 
lots of more than 200 pounds at 8000 per pound on the streets 
one pound broken down into grams nets a dealer 80000 
and its even more for crack he said referring to a form 
of cocaine that is smoked with one ounce of cocaine you can make 
370 vials of crack which means you can almost quadruple your 
money 
in new york city alone estimates are there are 600000 cocaine 
users more than half of them devotees of crack strang said 
last year the dea confiscated a record 55 tons of cocaine in the 
united states up from eight tons six years ago but production of 
the coca leaf is up in peru bolivia and colombia the largest 
producers of the sturdy tree that nets four harvests a year 
additionally detection of cocaine has become increasingly 
difficult as traffickers find new ways to smuggle it across every 
american border state 
officials point to the inventiveness of traffickers who are 
slipping the drugs into the united states in trucks over the mexican 
border small planes into the southern states and large freighters 
that can be loaded at sea 
we cant search them all gutensohn said 
smugglers have loaded cocaine at sea from one ship onto another 
some from hong kong and japan and stored the drug inside legitimate 
shipments of furniture in one case the cocaine in liquid form was 
hidden inside plastic bags and put into a fish tank 
it was discovered when the fish died an administration 
source said adding that in another incident the drug was neatly and 
professionally stuffed inside the planks of imported picnic tables 
the distribution chain starts with the large drug cartels in 
colombia and then moves to colombian dealers inside the united 
states from there it goes in quantities of up to 150 pounds to the 
trafficking groups mostly jamaicans dominicans and los angeles 
street gangs gutensohn said 
they purchase smaller levels and bring it to the inner 
cities he said 
the trafficking groups sell several pounds to dealers who operate 
what are called crack houses then the crack house owners 
sell to individual users 
youve got level after level gutensohn said 
colombian cocaine made a notable entrance on us streets in the 
1970s and trafficking has grown to the point where cocaine and 
colombia are essentially the same thing said don hamilton 
spokesman for the administrations office of national drug control 
policy 
but hypothetically if youve locked up a dozen or so people 
that would not break the trade he said 
a state department official who deals with south american drug 
issues said i think they are moving the networks out of colombia 
living there and enjoying the wealth but the cocaines going out 
from god knows where 
a sustained crackdown in colombia could over a long time have 
an impact but i dont think you could possibly tell for a year and 
even if you grab the bosses theres going to be somebody else who 
takes over said the official who following department guidelines 
spoke on condition he not be further identified 
kennington wall of the drug policy foundation a private research 
group seeking alternative strategies for fighting the drug war also 
said cocaine traffickers would move their operation bases to safer 
areas 
if you push it down in one place it will pop up in another 
he said

base capt tess taft said 
she did not have any other details about the flight 
the abbreviated second test flight of the b2 on aug 16 was

a defense contractor once fined for billing fraud 
a hairline crack in a casing of an accessory drive which powers 
the 530 million hightech jets generators and controls caused oil

federal investigations of bribery and fraud 
involving generic drugs have embarrassed the industry but do not 
appear to be dampening the popularity of its lowcost products with 
consumers 
industry officials and analysts say the public is so smitten with 
generic drugs which mimic namebrand products whose patents have 
expired but cost up to 70 percent less there should be no 
longterm damage to sales based on the revelations so far 
the 5billionayear industry has been absorbing week after week 
of damaging publicity lately about falsified test results and 
gratuities paid to federal officials more is likely in the months 
ahead 
the us attorneys office in baltimore already has obtained 
guilty pleas from some industry officials and federal regulators 
the department of health and human services the food and drug 
administration and congress have ongoing investigations 
the image has been tarnished theres no question said 
hemant k shah of warren nj a private financial analyst of the 
generic drug industry but i really dont expect anything other 
than business continuing to boom for generic drug companies 
jay molishever spokesman for the generic pharmaceutical industry 
association a trade group of 20 generic drug makers concedes a 
fear is beginning to take hold 
however molishever adds whatever downturn may occur because 
of the concern and there is concern we believe will be 
shortterm 
more than 400000 prescriptions nearly onethird of all 
prescriptions written last year in the united states were filled 
by generic drugs analysts expect that market share to keep growing 
to perhaps 37 percent by 1993 
their optimism is bouyed by what has not been unearthed while 
instances of falsified test results and gratuities paid to federal 
regulators to speed the governments approval process have been 
uncovered there have been no indications of tainted drugs 
i emphasize that we have no evidence that the safety or 
effectiveness of generic drugs has been compromised health and 
human services secretary louis w sullivan said in announcing a plan 
to beef up federal oversight of the industry 
pharmacists report no great hesitation by consumers to purchase 
generic drugs other than the 26 that the food and drug 
administration has recalled so far 
to put that figure in perspective the generic drug industry says 
that of 10000 drugs approved for sale in the united states 8000 
are copied and sold by generic producers with more generic versions 
available all the time as patents on the original products expire 
it is a little bit early but our people are not expecting to 
see a dip in generic sales said maryellen kari spokesperson for 
the walgreen co the deerfield ill based drug store chain whose 
49 billion in sales last year made it the nations largest 
there seems to be very little customer alarm generated by the 
publicity 
continuing investigations promise to produce more news in coming 
weeks 
the us attorneys office in baltimore which has jurisdiction 
because the food and drug administration is headquartered in 
rockville md so far has obtained guilty pleas from three fda 
officials three drug company officials and two drug companies for 
various crimes involving the fdas drug approval process 
assistant us attorney geoffrey garinther says his office has 
spent most of its time examining gratuities paid by companies to fda 
officials to speed approvals of generic drugs in an industry in 
which the first to hit the market often gets and retains a huge 
share of sales 
only recently he said have investigators begun looking into 
allegations of companies substituting brandname drugs for the 
generic products they claim to be testing under fda procedures 
companies send potential products to independent laboratories for 
testing and submit the results paperwork to the fda for its 
study 
last june vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens 
ny admitted it sought fda approval for a generic blood pressure 
drug by actually testing dyazide the brandname product it was 
supposed to copy 
my guess is there will be guilty pleas garinther said 
the fda is continuing its investigations of potential 
irregularities by 11 generic drug companies the agency is also 
studying the 30 most commonly used generic drugs accounting for 75 
percent of generic drug sales to verify that they were approved 
for sale legitimately 
the department of health and human services is auditing the fda 
its subdivision to make sure its oversight of generic drugs is 
effective 
in addition rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee plans to continue his series of 
hearings into problems within the industry and its regulation by the 
government

the chinese government gave new assurances 
saturday through a visiting chineseamerican that senior leader deng 
xiaoping is in good health despite persistent reports that he is 
seriously ill 
anna chennault head of the republican heritage groups council 
said dengs children assure me hes in very good health and still 
smoking and swimming and sometimes scolding them 
mrs chennault also said that during a dinner with beijing mayor 
chen xitong he said leaders erred in using troops against 
prodemocracy protesters in june 
chen said troops were used because police were not experienced in 
handling riots and probably they didnt have enough police mrs 
chennault said 
speaking at a news conference at the us embassy she said deng 
sent a message via his children that at this time it is better for 
him not to receive any foreign visitors to show hes not trying to 
take over and trying to control all the other officials 
deng 85 holds only one official post as head of the central 
military commission and in recent years has turned over much daily 
decisionmaking to his proteges in the communist party and 
government 
however he still wields final authority as was made clear when 
he ordered the june 34 army attack on demonstrators in beijing in 
which hundreds and possibly thousands died 
wellplaced chinese sources have said deng is seriously ill with 
cancer and is receiving medical care in beijing he has not been 
seen in public since early june 
reports from a variety of sources also indicate a power struggle 
is brewing over his succession and that members of the conservative 
faction that led the june crackdown are trying to play down dengs 
illness to gain time to consolidate their position 
mrs chennault however said she was told deng was in beidaihe 
a seaside resort northeast of beijing where he and other top 
officials vacationed in past summers 
i think this is a time that the leadership is going through 
some rearrangement of who will do what said mrs chennault she 
said she did not know enough about the situation to assess chinas 
stability 
mrs chennault who was born in beijing is the widow of gen 
claire lee chennault the famed world war ii flying tigers 
founder she has visited china often and occasionally advises 
president bush on asian affairs 
she said she plans to report to bush on her 10day visit 
mrs chennault said she met with vice president wang zhen 
communist party secretariat member ding guangen and other officials 
up to the ministerial level 
topics of discussion included ousted party chief zhao ziyang who 
was purged in late june in a power struggle over handling of the 
popular student led democracy movement and is still being 
investigated 
he has not been seen in public since late may and the government 
has indicated he may be put on trial 
asked what the leaders she met thought of zhao mrs chennault 
said certainly privately people agree zhao ziyang did a great 
deal 
she refused to go into more detail and would not say if her talks 
covered dissident fang lizhi the astrophysicist who has been hiding 
in the us embassy with his wife since june 
she also refused to say if bush had asked her to bring fang up to 
the chinese but said that she met with the president before leaving 
for china 
he did ask me verbally to tell his friends here that we are 
very interested in continuing the good relationship that we have 
tried so hard to build in the last more than 10 years or so mrs 
chennault said 
fangs presence in the embassy has strained chineseus 
relations already at a low point because of the crackdown there 
was speculation that one purpose of mrs chennaults visit was to 
discuss fang

voyager 2 discovered broad flat bands 
of dust orbiting neptune and found evidence the planet has 
southern lights nasa said today 
the probe also detected nitrogen in the atmosphere of triton the 
moon whose pink snow and ice volcanoes were described by excited 
scientists as unique in the solar system nasa said 
theres dust bands theyre broad said nasa astronomer rich 
terrile describing the findings from latest photorgraphs the bands 
orbit neptunes equator as do its narrow rings that were discovered 
by voyager earlier 
although voyager has passed its closest encounters with neptune 
and triton it continued today to back recorded photographs taken 
during the time of closest approach and scientists and engineers 
celebrated the spacecrafts successful flyby 
my understanding was most of the engineers and science team had 
one hell of a party last night mike urban a voyager engineer 
said today 
the oneton space probe capped its historic 443billionmile 
12year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3048 miles over 
neptunes north pole thursday night then dove past triton the 
planets largest moon it made its closest approach about 23900 
miles above the moons surface at 210 am pdt friday 
during its approach to neptune voyager discovered six moons 
besides triton and nereid which were first observed from earth it 
also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a 
partial ring or ring arc scientists believe will also prove to be 
a complete ring 
while only the narrow rings were visible as voyager flew toward 
neptune the broad dust bands became visible when they were backlit 
by sunlight after the space probe passed the planet terrile said 
that makes them look like saturns broad rings but only when viewed 
from behind neptune 
the same thing happened when voyager passed uranus in 1986 that 
planet had 10 narrow rings when seen by the approaching spacecraft 
which then found extensive bands of dust after passing uranus 
terrile said neptunes dust bands are not as extensive 
evidence for the glowing lights known as an aurora was found at 
30 degrees south latitude on neptune as voyagers ultraviolet light 
sensor made a northtosouth scan of the planet deputy project 
scientist ellis miner said today 
because the scan didnt cover different longitudes scientists 
dont know the auroras full extent or whether it circles neptune 
east to west as do earths auroras miner said 
miner said voyager also found nitrogen in tritons atmosphere 
nitrogen makes up 78 percent of earths atmosphere 
on earth the northern and southern lights encircle the poles 
but can get pushed closer to the equator when the sun generates 
magnetic storms however it would be very unusual for an aurora on 
earth to get as close to the equator as 30 degrees latitude 
auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in the 
solar wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetivc field lines on 
earth they glow in visible light neptunes lights glow ultraviolet 
because of hydrogen in its atmosphere 
engineers spent the night unloading voyagers eighttrack tape 
recorder playing back pictures and scientific data recorded during 
the neptune and triton rendezvous and also loaded new instructions 
telling the probe how to point its cameras and sensors urban said 
voyager today started sending back its most detailed images of 
triton which is fourfifths the size of earths moon but pictures 
returned friday were more than enough to stun scientists 
the range of geological forms is dazzling astronomerauthor 
carl sagan said friday we are almost certainly in a regime of 
volcanism involving ices maybe exotic ices such as water ice 
mixed with frozen nitrogen or methane natural gas 
the photographs show a cracked frozen triton scarred by 
thousandfoothigh ridges fault lines bowlshaped craters 
mysterious domes and dark spots ringed with white halos that so far 
defy explanation 
the images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any 
weve ever seen voyager project scientist edward stone said 
friday at the national aeronautics and space administrations jet 
propulsion laboratory 
icy volcanic flows have been seen on uranus moon ariel and some 
other moons but triton is the first place scientists have actually 
seen ice volcanoes stone said photographs showed at least three 
inactive volcanoes 
nasa geologist joseph boyce said one of the ice volcanoes which 
look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material measures 
several hundred miles across some were encircled with cliffs 1000 
to 2000 feet high 
the properties of exotic ices of water methane and nitrogen 
are very different from ordinary ice said sagan a member of 
the voyager imaging team that may explain the exoticness of the 
landforms 
parts of the moon are frozen methane discolored by a bombardment 
of radiation that produced chemical changes sagan said weve got 
pink snow think about how exotic that is 
preliminary measurements of tritons magnetic field suggest that 
it does not have a north pole and a south pole like earths magnetic 
field but rather multiple poles researchers said 
robert strom of the voyager imaging team said the relative 
scarcity of craters on triton tends to confirm speculation that 
triton originated outside the solar system and became captured by 
neptunes gravity perhaps after colliding with one of its moons 
voyager also revealed that triton has an atmosphere and is 
covered with a haze of what could be photochemical smog 
on the moons sunlit southern hemisphere frozen methane or other 
volatile material is boiling off the surface causing haze and 
condensing on the moons cooler regions scientists said 
voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 
saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 until oct 2 voyager 2 will look 
back at neptune then it will head toward interstellar space 
weary nasa scientists many of whom spent all night at the 
laboratory analyzing data returning from the spacecraft gushed over 
the spectacular images being received 
laurence soderblom of the voyager imaging team said wow what 
a way to leave the solar system

pope john paul ii on saturday marked the 50th 
anniversary of the outbreak of world war ii by condemning nazism and 
marxism as substitute religions and hailing democratic reform in 
his native poland 
the pontiff singled out poland while expressing support for the 
right of people to determine their own governments poland last week 
installed the first noncommunist government leader in the east bloc 
john paul made his appeals in a 20page apostolic letter marking 
the sept 1 anniversary of the start of the war and a 12page 
message to polish bishops on the same subject 
in the official english translation of the letter the pope said 
in it was our duty before god to remember the war in order to 
honor its victims forgive the offenses committed and reflect on 
its causes 
we have a duty to learn from the past so that never again will 
there arise a set of factors capable of triggering a similar 
conflagration he said in the apostolic letter according to an 
official englishlanguage text 
he traced nazi atrocities to its denial of god and law which he 
said led to the crushing of human rights and eventually the rights 
of nations 
nazi paganism and marxist dogma are both basically totalitarian 
ideologies and tend to become substitute religions he wrote in 
one of his harshest condemnations yet of communism 
focusing on his native land john paul said poland was on the 
winning side of the war but that under communist rule poles were 
forced to ask themselves whether they in fact being treated as the 
vanquished and were compelled to undertake new struggles 
for in truth a state whose society is not sovereign is no 
sovereign state at all the pope said in the message to polish 
bishops 
john paul was apparently referring to the campaign of the 
solidarity labor movement that culminated last week with the 
appointment of a noncommunist as prime minister 
at a news conference to release the papal documents cardinal 
roger etchegaray said the pope was holding up poland as an example 
he knows very well that the polish experience isnt limited to 
a national reality but can also be applied to other situations 
above all in europe said the french cardinal head of the 
vaticans council for justice and peace 
but asked whether the pope was advocating democracy for eastern 
europe and the baltic states etchegaray said one should not 
imagine that the pope tries to revise pacts to revise polands 
borders 
in his statements the pope also made a special appeal for an end 
to discrimination 
he singled out the nazi slaughter of the jews as something 
which will forever remain a shame for humanity 
about 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust 
jews and catholics are now embroiled in a dispute over a catholic 
convent at the site of the auschwitz death camp in poland 
jewish groups are outraged at the polish churchs refusal to move 
the convent as promised they say the convent and its christian 
symbols are insults to the memory of the 25 million jews who died 
there 
asked why the pope had not intervened etchegaray said knowing 
the degree to which the pope respects the local churches the 
pope shows himself even more respectful of the local church he comes 
from

at least 20 people were shot and killed 
in a central sri lankan village military officals said saturday 
and residents accused soldiers of carrying out the killings 
up to 16 more people were killed in various attacks during the 
past 24 hours officials said 
all the victims of fridays attack in tirapanne 100 miles 
northeast of colombo were sinhalese and their bodies were thrown in 
six houses that were later burned said military officials who 
cannot be identified under briefing rules 
residents in anuradhapura 12 miles from tirapanne blamed the 
attack on soldiers in civilian clothes and said they apparently 
meant to avenge the slayings of a fellow soldiers parents the 
residents contacted by telephone spoke on condition of anonymity 
progovernment vigilante groups and the military have been 
accused in the past of killing civilians during operations against 
sinhalese extremists the government denies the charge 
an opposition lawmaker janak mahendra adikari said in 
anuradhapura that the tirapanne toll could be much higher he said 
hundreds of villagers had fled to anuradhapura 
in another attack friday men in military uniforms burned six or 
seven homes in katukeliyawa 15 miles south of anuradhapura said 
adikari contacted by telephone 
there are reports of five to six civilian casualties in this 
attack but we do not have confirmation he said the military 
could not immediately confirm the attack 
the government armed the military with sweeping powers under 
emergency laws to curb an antigovernment campaign by the sinhalese 
extremists belonging to the peoples liberation front 
the front stepped up its campaign of assassinations and strikes 
after president ranasinghe premadasa imposed a nationwide state of 
emergency june 20 the government says at least 1000 people have 
died since july 15 
in their latest attack radicals detonated a bomb under a police 
vehicle in kurunegala district friday killing three policemen and a 
civilian driver the military officials said 
one laborer traveling in the vehicle also was killed and five 
policemen were injured in the blast about 85 miles northeast of 
colombo the officials said 
they said two policemen and a wildlife official were killed 
friday in an ambush of their vehicle in anuradhapur district which 
carries the same name as its largest town 
a naval officer a front member and three civilians were killed 
in separate incidents during the past 24 hours in southern sri 
lanka the officials said one unidentified body also was found they 
said 
at least 5000 people have died in the sinhalese extremist 
campaign launched in july 1987 to protest the governments peace 
overtures to tamil separatists in the northeast 
the radicals said the government gave too many concessions to the 
minority tamil community in an indiasponsored peace plan of june 
29 1987 that aimed to end the sixyear tamil demand for an 
independent nation 
sinhalese radicals also were angered by the deployment of indian 
peacekeeping soldiers in the northeast invited to enforce the june 
1987 accord they said the indian presence compromised the 
countrys sovereignty 
the accord collapsed when the strongest tamil rebel group 
rejected it and began attacking indian troops at least 1000 
indian soldiers have died in the fighting more than 10000 sri 
lankans have been killed in the sixyear separatist war 
tamils who form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalese 
majority who make up 75 percent of the population 
the sinhalese control the government and the military 
india became involved in the ethnic problems of its small 
southeastern neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 
million tamils

hundreds of thousands of people 
are streaming across european borders in one of the largest 
migrations in years many using new travel freedoms to seek out old 
homelands 
east germans are flooding into west germany moscow is granting 
some soviet jews their longtime wish to emigrate and ethnic turks 
have fled in record numbers to turkey from virtual persecution in 
bulgaria 
one immigration expert says the borderblurring flood may be the 
biggest mass movement of europeans since after world war ii the 
bulk of the migration has been from the east bloc to the west with 
many taking advantage of looser travel restrictions to escape 
stagnant economies 
about 400000 ethnic germans from the soviet union and five other 
eastern european countries are expected in west germany this year 
that marks an emotional homecoming for the descendants of settlers 
who themselves sought a better life by heading eastward decades 
even centuries ago 
i myself left the german democratic republic in 1952 says 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of the new 
arrivals from that communist nation i know whats driving these 
people on and i know that no one makes a snap decision to flee 
the number of east germans reaching west germany this year is 
expected to hit 100000 the highest number since 207000 people 
arrived in 1961 when the berlin wall was built 
so far in 1989 the majority of the east germans leaving behind a 
growing sense of hopelessness in their bleak pollutionridden 
country are emigrating legally 
but for those leaving without permission the escapes can range 
from a deathdefying swim across a berlin river to a sprint across 
the border between hungary and austria 
many of the refugees are young workers who will be sorely missed 
back in east germany a country of 166 million on saturday alone 
more than 100 east germans crossed illegally into austria 
authorities said 
east germany intensified a media campaign aimed at stemming the 
flow of refugees to the west the communist party daily neues 
deutschland printed 23 letters it said it received from readers 
criticizing west german media coverage of the exodus and warning 
east germans of an uncertain future in the west 
the west german media has become hysterical the newspaper 
quoted a man identified as hansdieter stuck they want to 
hoodwink young and old into giving up home and hearth 
west germany is the promised land for another current wave of 
european migrants ethnic germans whose ancestors settled in what 
is now the soviet union and other parts of eastern europe 
generations ago 
last year we had 200000 and this year we are counting on 
400000 says ina ruehl an expert with the west german red cross 
in bonn 
the numbers she cited reflect the new arrivals from the soviet 
union poland romania hungary czechoslovakia and yugoslavia 
after the war it was 12 million people that was the largest 
movement ms ruehl said referring to the exodus of germans from 
eastern europe following the collapse of the nazis third reich 
so this is really the secondbiggest such movement 
by comparison up until 1987 only about 600 ethnic germans were 
allowed to emigrate from their homes in the harsh climes of siberia 
and soviet central asia 
emigration is regarded by many as the only possibility to 
remain germans to preserve their traditions language and 
culture the official soviet news agency tass said aug 17 
summing up the views of a new organization representing the 
minoritys interests 
last week the head of the soviet unions visa agency said that 
due to eased travel restrictions 200000 soviets are expected to 
emigrate this year rudolf kuznetsov said about 107000 soviets 
already have received permission to leave this year most of the 
emigrants go to the united states and west germany 
the soviets have begun to open the gates for the estimated 18 
million to 3 million jews demanding the right to emigrate since 
1971 about 300000 soviet jews have left 
thousands have made their way to italy by way of vienna hoping 
to eventually reach the united states but while the united states 
used to welcome the soviet jews with open arms that policy was 
tightened in october 
the ethnic turks streaming out of bulgaria are leaving behind 
official harassment bordering on outright persecution 
bulgarian authorities have embarked on an assimiliation campaign 
forcing the ethnic turks to adopt slavic names the ethnic turks say 
they have been fined and beaten for speaking turkish in public and 
for practicing islamic rites 
the number had climbed to more than 300000 in three months 
before ankara began clamping down last week in hopes of forcing 
concessions from bulgarias communist authorities 
about 30000 romanians most of them ethnic hungarians have fled 
to hungary over the past two years the ethnic hungarians also 
demand the right to use their language and maintain their cultural 
traditions are violated 
hungarys willingness to take in the refugees and budapests 
championing of their rights have worsened the already strained 
relations between the two warsaw pact allies 
sheer economic need often remains the greatest force for massive 
internal migrations within europe demonstrated by the millions of 
turks italians spaniards and others who have found work in 
northern european countries over the last few decades

the evangelical lutheran church in america 
has decided to make sure dissenting voices are heard when the new 
denomination makes a pronouncement on a controversial social issue 
the church approved a policy of recognizing substantial minority 
views friday in a session that also affirmed membership in the 
sometimes controversial national council of churches and world 
council of churches the ecumenical organizations include most major 
protestant and eastern orthodox churches in this country and around 
the world 
the method of handling church pronouncements including dissent 
came in the adoption of a document detailing the basis for speaking 
out on moral issues in society 
delegates narrowly approved an amendment offered by christa klein 
of york pa providing that whenever significant division is shown 
in approving social pronouncements summaries will be given of 
dissenting positions 
the rev frank lay of oregon ill argued this would reduce 
the force of statements and the rev l edward knudson of 
milwaukie ore contended it would take away impact and meaning 
however the rev douglas johnson of spring grove pa said 
intelligent and moral honesty demanded that there be room in the 
church for those who differ and that this should be openly 
recognized 
as a parish pastor this is one of the problems i have 
struggled with when a stand is taken with which someone doesnt 
agree he said 
the provision was approved by a 489453 vote 
lengthy debate preceded the vote for membership of the 
53million denomination fourthlargest among us protestants in 
the national council of churches the council has been involved in 
leadership conflicts and financial strains and is undergoing 
structural reforms 
bishop glenn nycklemoe of the southeastern minnesota synod based 
in rochester minn said he had reversed his opposition to 
belonging to the council sensing new directions and new spirit 
in it 
of the three lutheran bodies merged into the denomination the 
former lutheran church in america had belonged to the national 
council but not the former american lutheran church or former 
association of evangelical lutheran churches 
the eightday assembly which runs through next wednesday also 
adopted working guidelines for ecumenical efforts for christian 
unity 
citing the biblical and theological bases for it the 5000word 
document urges work for the oneness to which god calls the world 
in the saving gift of jesus christ

police arrested 30 people in 
cape town on saturday during two protests against a controversial 
rugby tour by a squad of international allstars 
the demonstrations held hours before the start of a match were 
part of a nationwide antiapartheid campaign launched aug 2 to 
protest segregation and the sept 6 parliamentary elections which 
exclude the black majority 
in other developments anglican archbishop desmond tutu sent 
letters to four western leaders including president bush 
describing the almost daily unrest this month in black and 
mixedrace townships outside cape town 
and the countrys two largest antiapartheid labor federations 
met near johannesburg to discuss strategies for opposing laws that 
limit worker rights 
twenty eight demonstrators were arrested at a hotel in cape town 
after meeting briefly with willie john mcbride manager of the 
international squad made up of australian french and british 
players 
several demonstrators carried posters that read mercenaries go 
home and apartheid tour must stop 
two activists also were arrested when about 30 protesters 
gathered outside the main cape town branch of first national bank 
sponsor of the rugby tour bank officials said they have received 
several bomb threats in recent days 
the activists were identified as dawood khan a spokesman for the 
western cape traders association and willie hofmeyer a leader of 
the banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition 
police on friday banned all rallies in protest of the tour the 
international teams visit has been denounced by activists as a 
breach of a sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid 
the international xv squad whose tour was approved by the 
international rugby board already has played two matches in south 
africa but saturdays contest was the first against the south 
african national squad the springboks 
rugby is the most popular team sport among white south africans 
who believe their squad would be the best in the world if allowed to 
compete regularly on an international level 
saturdays match which the springboks won 2019 marked the 
first international competition for the south african team since a 
new zealand team made an unsanctioned rebel tour in 1986 
in most sports the world governing bodies have barred south 
africans from international competition because of apartheid 
however the degree of sanctions varies in each sport 
south africa has not been allowed to compete in the olympics 
since 1960 and generally its amateur teams have difficulty playing 
abroad or attracting visitors in professional sports south africa 
often lures foreign competitors with huge sums of money in cricket 
boxing golf and tennis 
british cricket players have agreed to a tour in january even 
though they will face an automatic fiveyear suspension from 
international competition south africa also stages an annual golf 
tournament with a 1 million first prize the largest of any 
tournament and consistenly draws top players 
tutus spokesman john allen declined to release details of the 
letters but he said tutu mailed them to bush british prime 
minister margaret thatcher french president francois mitterand and 
west german chancellor helmut kohl 
the clashes between activists and police have escalated steadily 
since the launch of the defiance campaign and police blamed two 
deaths friday on rioters 
the two labor federations that met saturday the congress of 
south african trade unions with 900000 members and the smaller 
national council of trade unions have said they make take protest 
action before the elections 
gen hennie de witt the police commissioner imposed tight 
restrictions on the meetings allowing only union members to attend 
prohibiting political banners and restricting discussions to labor 
issues 
dozens of police armed with shotguns and tear gas were present at 
the meeting attended by 800 delegates

six centuries after the ottoman turks 
launched their conquest of the balkans from this city bursa is 
bursting with refugees fleeing part of the old empire 
this city of ancient mosques and modern factories has become a 
symbol of turkeys problems in dealing with a flood of ethnic turks 
migrating from bulgaria to escape a campaign to erase their culture 
since midmay 310000 ethnic turks have arrived from bulgaria in 
one of the largest mass movements of people since world war ii 
the difficulties prompted turkey to impose a visa requirement 
last week to curtail the immigration 
the ethnic turks say they are escaping a forced assimilation 
campaign aimed at changing their moslem names to slavic ones wiping 
out use of the turkish language and halting the practice of islamic 
rites 
like immigrants the world over the bulgarian turks flooded into 
areas where earlier arrivals had established communities bursa 150 
miles southwest of istanbul received the largest group an 
estimated 75000 
enough said mayor teoman ozalp in an interview in three 
months the city population rose by 10 percent we cannot cope with 
it no city in the world can cope with it 
immigrants residents and city officials say the major problem is 
housing 
many immigrants have gone to stay with relatives who are putting 
up as many as 15 or 20 newcomers in their threeroom houses 
about 20000 immigrants have been given shelter in schools but 
they will have to be evacuated shortly in preparation for the start 
of classes sept 18 
in the shade at a schoolyard ismail sukruoglu oren spoke of his 
problems since arriving from bulgaria four days earlier the welder 
had just gotten a job but was unable to find a home for his family 
it was hell there but it is trouble here too he said 
immigrants say that when they do find work they get less than 
the minimum wage 
for residents the problems have mounted too bursa natives 
complain that some employers are firing workers to hire cheaper 
immigrant labor they say rents have doubled and tripled since the 
arrival of the ethnic turks 
according to mumin gencoglu head of the balkan immigrants 
association lack of organization by the government has exacerbated 
the problem 
what are farmers doing in this industrial city he asked 
the government should have divided people according to their 
professions and sent them to areas where there are jobs or land 
available for farming 
prefabricated houses should have been constructed immediately he 
said 
the government has promised to give 150 a month to each family 
for rent beginning next month 
but there are no houses for rent we already had a housing 
shortage when they started coming says mayor ozalp 
the government tried to send the ethnic turks to different parts 
of the country but the orders were not mandatory 
we have lost track of 100000 arrivals said the minister in 
charge of the immigrants ercument konukman they did not go where 
they were sent we believe most went to bursa or istanbul 
even critics of the government admit that no one expected so many 
bulgarian turks streaming in from the balkans which was part of the 
ottoman empire bursa was the capital of that empire in the 14th 
century 
the mass migration began when bulgaria expelled leaders of a 
protest against the 5yearold assimilation campaign bulgaria then 
began issuing passports that allowed ethnic turks to leave with a 
few suitcases and bundles of household goods unleashing a flood of 
emigration to turkey 
turkish premier turgut ozal initially said he was prepared to 
admit all of bulgarias estimated 15 million ethnic turks offers 
of jobs and housing poured in from around the country and the first 
100000 arrivals were handled relatively smoothly 
but turkey miscalculated believing bulgaria would not want to 
risk labor shortages by allowing a mass emigration of ethnic turks 
who make up more than 15 percent of bulgarias population 
as of tuesday ethnic turks were allowed in only with visas from 
turkish consulates 
ozal has defended the new requirement as necessary to force 
bulgaria into negotiations on an immigration agreement turkey is 
seeking to control the pace of the exodus and ensure immigrants are 
compensated for property left behind and accumulated pension 
benefits 
turkish officials have pledged to give priority in issuing visas 
to divided families but immigrants are not satisfied 
now they have no hope now they will be wiped out as an ethnic 
group lamented one sabahattin hatipoglu

guam wants the united states to pay millions of 
dollars in reparations for the brutal japanese occupation of the 
pacific island during world war ii a debt the us government 
forgave in 1951 for diplomatic reasons 
although we feel that a moral obligation falls on japan we 
cannot seek justice from the japanese said joseph f ada 
governor of the us territory located only 1150 miles from tokyo 
from 194144 guam suffered through some of the most brutal 
treatment ever inflicted on an american community survivors recall 
massacres beatings forced labor and other horrors 
but the united states most unfortunately gave away our right to 
reparation from the japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with japan 
without anybody once asking our people according to ada 
the bush administration opposes reparations saying the us 
government spent 8 million immediately after the war on 4200 
death personal injury and property damage claims 
there is no reason for the american taxpayers to pay further 
compensation for world war ii claims arising from enemy action 
said larry l morgan of the interior department which in 1950 took 
over responsibility for guam from the navy 
a guam reparations commission appointed this year asked for 
compensation totaling 160 million to include payments for deaths 
injuries forced labor forced marches or internment 
the waiver of japanese reparations granted early in the korean 
war was a policy decision of the united states to conclude a 
quick treaty with japan to turn japan into a valuable asian ally 
and a bulwark against communist expansion ada said 
ada appeared last month at a hearing on guam war reparations 
legislation introduced by ben blaz guams nonvoting delegate in 
the house of representatives the measure faces more hearings and a 
possible committee vote later this year 
the island of 212 square miles about onesixth the size of 
rhode island was acquired from spain in 1898 after the 
spanishamerican war it remains a key us pacific military base 
japanese still invade guam but this time as tourists boosting 
the islands main civilian industry accounting for most of the 
500000 annual visitors to guams beaches 
blaz and ada say the new payments are justified in light of 67 
million paid in micronesian war claims and the 20000 authorized by 
congress for each japaneseamerican interned during world war ii 
too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and 
there was confusion over the eligibility of guam natives who 
received us citizenship only in 1950 said blaz 
guam senator eddie duenas said apparently many who were 
eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or 
were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives 
a guamanian woman mrs beatrice perez emsley recalled during 
the summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness 
in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated chamorros native 
tribespeople 
she said a japanese soldier had tossed her there without 
realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used 
a bayonet instead of sword 
i could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the 
dirt was beginning to choke me i had to bear the pain and keep 
still or else those japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me 
she said 
mrs emsley now 58 said she finally crawled into the jungle and 
wandered for a week until another guamanian fugitive found her 
years later they met members of the us 3rd marine division who 
were liberating the island 
reparations will not remove from us the awful memories of the 
horrors we witnessed or experienced she said but they will 
show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us 
duenas the senator said that the united states made death 
payments ranging as low as 221 and high as 3500 to 750 people on 
guam after the war 
island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of the 
population or up to 2000 people were killed and 90 percent 
suffered severe hardship injury or disease 
the blaz bill contained an initial authorization for 20 million 
specifying 20000 for the estates of those killed 15000 for 
personal injury 1000 for forced labor and 7000 for forced march 
or internment

prime minister felipe gonzalez will dissolve 
parliament this week and call early elections to coincide with the 
seventh anniversary of his socialist partys first victory a 
newspaper report said saturday 
analysts said the early elections would allow the gonzalez to 
take advantage of favorable results in european parliamentary 
elections disarray among opposition groups and a strong economy 
the independent el pais spains leading newspaper said the 
47yearold leader would dissolve parliament on sept 2 and set 
elections for oct 29 an election had been scheduled for june 1990 
at the latest 
the paper cited unidentified government sources for its report 
gonzalez would be seeking an unprecedented third term for the 
socialists 
on oct 28 1982 the socialists won a landslide victory in 
elections to gain their first parliamentary majority in the history 
of spanish democracy they won another majority in june 1986 
the analysts who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
gonzalezs party could benefit from the june elections across 
western europe when socialists won 395 percent of the vote for the 
european parliament 
they said the prime minister also was taking advantage of a 
strong economy and the breakdown of an alliance between the 
conservative popular party and the centrist social democratic center 
the socialists hold 183 of the 350 seats in the lower house of 
parliament the popular party holds 91 the social democratic center 
has 28 and the rest of the seats are controlled by several smaller 
parties 
in addition the analysts pointed out that spains economy has 
grown by 45 percent annually for the past three years setting a 
european record 
early elections could also disrupt the momentum of the leading 
socialist and communist labor unions whose leaders have hinted at 
strike action later this year

railroad workers heeded a call by 
solidarity leader lech walesa to end a oneday strike today but 
they sent an appeal to prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki asking him 
to satisfy their pay demands 
the conclusion of the strike at one minute after midnight friday 
followed walesas appeal that the new prime minister be allowed to 
start work with the support of all poles the independent trade 
union leader said mazowieckis election was a breakthrough not 
to be wasted 
walesa also suggested friday that the strike by the railway 
workers in lodz the countrys secondlargest city located in 
central poland could be a provocation against mazowiecki who 
this week took office as head of the first noncommunist government 
in the east bloc 
we trust that as premier you represent the interests of the 
working people and you will take immediately decisions satisfying 
our demands the workers said in announcing the end of the strike 
the statement was carried on pap the state news agency 
abandoning the strike they said was proof of our support and 
trust for mazowiecki 
the prime minister who assumed office thursday in a historic 
transfer of power from the communist party to a solidarityled 
coalition traveled to the southern shrine city of czestochowa today 
to take part in annual ceremonies honoring the black madonna 
polands most revered icon 
he planned meetings with various political leaders as he began 
the task of assembling his cabinet 
in his first meeting with a top soviet official the prime 
minister met in warsaw with vladimir kryuchkov the chief of the 
soviet kgb who is on a working visit to poland said ryszard 
wojtkowski acting as mazowieckis spokesman 
the meeting was private and its agenda was not known beforehand 
kryuchkov spoke with several of polands top communist officials 
the soviet union has generally approved the dramatic political 
changes in poland however the soviet communist party daily pravda 
today said that while polish communists may have suffered a defeat 
nobody should write their political obituary the article appeared 
to be a warning to polish radicals 
with the mazowieckis election pravda said extremistminded 
people are hurrying to write off the polish united workers party 
because they argue it has finally found itself in isolation 
abandoned by its associates 
that would be premature pravda cautioned in fact it said the 
communists by right are the most important group in polish politics 
mazowiecki met friday with emissaries from the superpowers 
including us labor secretary elizabeth dole and soviet ambassador 
vladimir brovikov 
after the meeting mrs dole said washington will consider new 
ways to help poland but she did not mention financial aid beyond 
the 119 million president bush offered during a july visit 
solidarity leaders have been hoping for a 10 billion from the 
west and walesa said the west would be to blame if polands new 
government failed for lack of financial aid 
obviously we do have a budget deficit at home mrs dole 
said we will provide aid as we can when we can but there is 
already a very significant program under way 
she said bush soon will send us experts to poland to study how 
they can help 
her husband senate minority leader robert dole rkan and 
three democrats sen frank lautenberg of new jersey rep jim moody 
of wisconsin and sen dennis deconcini also attended the meeting 
dole said mazowiecki told him he who helps early helps 
twice in other words this is very important now to keep up the 
momentum and let the polish people see some change 
walesa who convinced communist president wojciech jaruzelski to 
support the solidarityled government said friday that mazowieckis 
selection was the breakthrough needed to stop polands economic 
decline 
but to succeed poland needs financial help and much more than 
the west has offered so far walesa said friday on abcs 2020 
i will say that if we fail we can blame the world even the 
united states that you havent contributed with cooperation in 
these conditions of civilization development you will be to blame 
for polish failure he said 
in a show of support unthinkable just a few months ago communist 
party chief miezcyslaw f rakowski interrupted an official visit to 
bulgaria to send mazowiecki a telegram friday promising the partys 
support in everything aiming at leading the country out of the 
crisis 
soviet ambassador vladimir brovikov met with mazoiecki and 
congratulated him on his election by the sejm the lower house of 
the national assembly mazowiecki sent greetings to the soviet 
people a government spokesman said

stood before the judge who called him mr kocher and told him he 
had been charged with shooting a 7yearold girl in the back with a 
hunting rifle 
cameron kocher pleaded innocent moving closer to becoming 
apparently the youngest person ever in the country to be tried on an 
adult homicide charge he is 10 
the boy let out a heavy sigh as he turned to his parents keith 
and patricia kocher after his arraignment ended friday 
prosecutors have ruled out the death penalty if the the 
fourthgrader is convicted mark pazuhanich a monroe county 
assistant district attorney said life in prison remains a 
possibility though he hasnt decided yet what punishment he would 
seek no trial date has been set 
camerons lawyer said prosecutors who fought a request to move 
the case to juvenile court should realize they are not dealing with 
a miniature adult 
he doesnt understand the concept of murder and doesnt fully 
understand the concept of death charles hansford said after the 
arraignment i dont know how to prepare him 
cameron is charged with killing a playmate firstgrader jessica 
carr she died march 6 two months before camerons 10th birthday 
after she was shot as she rode on the back of a snowmobile 
schools were closed that day because of heavy snow cameron 
jessica 13yearold shannon ratti and other children were spending 
the day playing video games at shannons house in kresgeville a 
town of 250 people in the foothills of the pocono mountains 
after shannons father richard ratti found dirty dishes in the 
house he put the video games off limits and the children went 
outside to ride snowmobiles but camerons parents had told him not 
to ride snowmobiles when they werent around and he left the house 
angry and went to his home next door ratti testified 
the boy said the shooting was an accident while he was playing 
with a gun but investigators gave this account of what happened 
next ticking off a list of deliberate steps that the judge cited in 
his decision to have the boy tried as an adult 
cameron took a key from under a lamp in his parents bedroom and 
opened his fathers gun cabinet took out a 35caliber marlin 
leveraction hunting rifle his father had taught him to shoot and 
loaded it 
after unlocking a bedroom window and opening it cameron took out 
the screen and set it aside and he pointed the rifle out the 
window investigators said 
at 105 pm a shot rang out and jessica about 100 yards away 
fell from the back of the snowmobile shannon was driving 
the rifles recoil slammed the scope into camerons face cutting 
his forehead cameron put the rifle back in the cabinet bandaged 
his forehead and hid a spent shell casing 
fearing a sniper was on the loose ratti called cameron and told 
him to come back to his house for safety rattis wife trudy 
testified that cameron explained the bandage on his forehead by 
saying he cut himself with a knife when a dog jumped on him as he 
made a peanut butterandjelly sandwich 
as others frantically tried to help jessica cameron sat on the 
rattis floor and resumed playing the video game ratti testified 
cameron kept playing the game while the other children prayed and 
made getwell cards for the girl 
if you dont think about it you wont be sad ratti quoted 
cameron as saying 
the girl was pronounced dead about an hour after she was shot 
cameron was arrested two days later after investigators found his 
blood on the rifle 
cameron told psychotherapists he was playing hunter when he 
was looking through the guns scope and the rifle accidentally 
fired he said he couldnt see anything through the scope but snow 
and trees dr robert sadoff a psychiatrist who examined cameron 
for the court has testified 
a ballistics specialist testified the rifle could not have 
discharged accidently unless a severe blow to the rifle forced the 
hammer to strike the firing pin 
citing camerons apparent mental stability aboveaverage grades 
and the deliberate actions he allegedly took before and after the 
shooting monroe county judge ronald vican in june refused to move 
the case from criminal court to juvenile court hansford has 
appealed 
pazuhanich said the case one of two murders in the county this 
year troubles him 
im preoccupied with how the boy is reacting to the process 
im preoccupied by the tension thats in that neighborhood when you 
have the rattis and the kochers living side by side and the carrs 
still visit the rattis and everybody is in close proximity to one 
another he said 
you wonder as im sure the carrs do what was going through

media magnate rupert murdoch says 
british television is overrated obsessed with the past and badly in 
need of competition 
murdoch whose holdings include the fox television network in the 
united states as well as newspapers and magazines in several 
countries recently ventured into british television with sky 
channel received by subscribers on satellite dishes 
in a speech friday at the edinburgh international television 
festival murdoch said americas mostwatched programs are far more 
impressive than those in britain 
much of what passes for quality on british television is really 
no more than a reflection of the values of the narrow elite which 
controls it murdoch said 
but this publicservice tv system has had in my view 
debilitating effects on british society by producing tv programs 
which are often obsessed with class dominated by anticommercial 
attitudes and with a tendency to hark back to the past 
murdochs sky channel is competing with britains four television 
channels two operated by the governments british broadcasting 
corp and two by independent television he said television should 
be subject to the same laws of supply and demand as newspapers 
journals magazines books and feature films 
i believe that a largely marketled television system with 
viewers choosing from a wide variety of channels financed in 
different ways will produce a better television system than 
todays he said though he did not advocate that the bbc turn to 
commercial support

thousands of civil rights demonstrators men 
clad in black women and children in white marched quietly upon the 
supreme court and the capitol today in a reprise of the naacps 
historic silent march of 1917 in new york city 
the washington march was concerned with one issue alone the 
supreme court and its recent hostile decisions diluting 
affirmative action and minority setaside programs said benjamin l 
hooks executive director of the naacp 
but the tone and style of the protest led by six drummers with 
muffled drums was fashioned after a march in new york city 72 years 
ago to protest segregation and the lynchings of blacks in the south 
on that occasion web dubois led 8000 people down fifth avenue 
in utter silence that day too the men dressed in black and the 
women and children in white 
us park police estimated the turnout when the march began at 
only 5000 but revised that figure to 35000 as the ranks swelled 
during the 1 hour procession to the capitol from washingtons mall 
us capitol police put the crowd which assembled on the capitol 
grounds at the end of the march at 18500 according officer greg 
nevitt 
hooks claimed from the podium that the march had drawn a turnout 
of 135000 
each of the marchers carried a printed affirmation which said 
we march to send a message to all people regardless of race 
color religion sex or ethnic orgin that we will not and cannot 
acquiesce quietly as an uncaring supreme court majority dismantles 
court ruling after court ruling and turns its face toward the dark 
past and away from the present and future 
and it said we march proudly in the footsteps of our brave 
sisters and brothers from another age who marched 72 years ago in 
silent witness against lynching discrimination segregation and 
racism for us not to march at this point in time would be a grave 
disservice to them 
the protest was aimed specifically at four decisions by the court 
this year in the view of civil rights lawyers the ruling in 
patterson vs mclean credit union sharply limited the previous power 
of minorities to sue private parties including schools for 
discrimatory practices similarly the courts decision in richmond 
vs j a croson co was seen as diluting job setaside programs and 
other affirmative action plans 
march organizers also assailed the decision in martin vs wilks 
which allowed white firefighters in birmingham ala to attack a 
consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of 
reverse discrimination the fourth ruling wards cove vs 
antonio was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in 
job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias rather 
than requiring employers to demonstrate at the same time that 
their hiring practices furthered legitimate business interests 
the march culminated with a rally at the capitol where hooks and 
other civil rights leaders were scheduled to speak 
the rev jesse jackson the rev joseph lowery head of the 
southern christian leadership conference and mayors kurt schmoke of 
baltimore and marion barry of washington also were on the program 
on friday hooks talked about recent incidents of violence 
directed at his organization saying they have raised our level of 
concern not only for ourselves but for all other institutions and 
individuals who traditionally draw the wrath of racists 
several shots were fired july 19 into the naacp headquarters 
last monday a teargas bomb concealed in a package sent through 
the mail exploded at a regional office in atlanta 
these are the acts of terrorists hooks said people could 
have been behind those lighted windows in baltimore and in atlanta 
several innocent people including children and the elderly had to 
receive medical care 
if these acts were meant to frighten us or deter us from 
any course of action they failed completely we did not give in to 
terrorism when the ku klux klan was riding high and mighty and we 
will not give in to these latterday terrorists he said 
we are not looking toward bringing vast numbers of people to 
washington hooks said in this instance the medium is the 
message and the medium is the silent march 
the supreme court has often been the target of major 
demonstrations in the capital in recent years an estimated 325000 
turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion however the court weeks later 
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for antiabortion 
forces

army officials pored over seized records 
from a drug barons financial empire saturday and police announced 
the arrest of eight more suspects in the killing of a presidential 
candidate 
army gen ramon niebles told the associated press in a telephone 
interview he expected the seized records to be of great value in 
our campaign to wipe out narcotics trafficking 
authorities said the records include numbers of local and foreign 
bank transactions as well as names of lawyers and others involved in 
the financial empire of reputed cocaine kingpin gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha 
the records were discovered at his rural bunkerlike estate 
seized by the army thursday near the town of pacho about 60 miles 
north of bogota 
we are processing these documents which provide fine 
information on the estate said niebles commander of the 13th 
army brigade 
he declined to disclose details of the records or anticipate what 
actions such as future raids they might inspire according to the 
bogota daily el tiempo the records represent the financial books 
for rodriguez gacha since 1982 
rodriguez gacha nicknamed the mexican for his affection for 
that countrys music and culture is among the bosses of the 
socalled medellin cartel based in the industrial city of medellin 
the cartel is the worlds largest cocainetrafficking organization 
and supplies an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine distributed in 
the united states 
dozens of luxurious homes apartments and offices believed owned 
by gacha were among hundreds of properties siezed in an 
eightdayold offensive by police and military forces nationwide 
the unprecendented crackdown was prompted by the assassination of 
a highly popular presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan 
police in bogota announced the arrest of eight more suspects in 
galans killing aug 16 at a political rally on bogotas southern 
outskirts bringing to 13 the total of suspected participants or 
accomplices under arrest 
five heavily armed men were arrested in a surprise raid last week 
at a downtown bogota apartment four of them were identified by more 
than a dozen witnesses at the rally 
galans killing capped a 48hour wave of assassinations 
including that of a national police colonel in medellin and a 
prominent bogota magistrate it outraged colombian society and 
inspired the government crackdown backed by a series of tough 
emergency decrees by president virgilio barco 
barco renewed extradition with the united states and streamlined 
the procedure to reduce the need for extensive judicial review 
under bloody intimidation by traffickers the supreme court 
nullified the extradition treaty in june 1987 
about 11000 people have been detained in the government sweep 
including a handful of suspects described by colombian authorities 
as major traffickers or drugmoney managers wanted by the united 
states 
drug and legal experts at the us embassy were working over the 
weekend to try to arrange the extradition of some of the suspects 
sources said as were colombian justice officials 
on friday authorities disclosed the arrest in medellin of 
rodriguez gachas alleged finance chief luis fernando galeano 
berrio army officials said he was wanted in the united states on 
drug charges 
they said they also arrested freddy rodriguez a son of rodriguez 
gacha and that he also is wanted in the united states but there 
was no immediate us confirmation american narcotics experts in 
bogota previously have confirmed that three other suspects arrested 
in the sweep are wanted by us courts 
cartel bosses such as rodriguez gacha pablo escobar and jorge 
ochoa continue to elude authorities 
according to the bogota daily el espectador rodriguez gacha 
escaped to brazil wednesday in a private aircraft local press 
reports have placed escobar the medellin cartels most notorious 
leader in panama

luxurious the kinky and the macabre at one ranch owned by 
rodriguez gacha soldiers found a wooden gallows but said they have 
no idea if it was ever used 
another drug lords estate featured a twostory stone playhouse 
for children built like a medieval castle opulent mirrored 
bedrooms with tiger skins valuable paintings and other works of 
art saunas and indoor swimming pools are common features 
at a mansion outside bogota believed to belong to reputed 
trafficker camilo zapata the army uncovered a room filled with 
articles of withcraft including potions dried tigers feet 
rotting vegetables and fruit and images of christ immersed in

editors note jalalabad has been under siege ever since soviet 
troops withdrew early this year the pressure from guerrillas has 
eased somewhat but jalalabad remains a city on edge an associated 
press reporter visited jalalabad last week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as this city tries to return to 
normalcy after six months on the front line of the afghan war the 
frequent boom of heavy weapons serves as a reminder that guerrillas 
are still around 
schools shops and factories are open again but jalalabad is a 
shadow of the legendary garden city beloved by afghan kings for its 
mediterranean climate and leisurely lifestyle 
this strategic city on the road from kabul to pakistan is 
shellpocked but officials say the worst is over and there is 
widespread longing for peace 
since soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan on feb 15 
jalalabad has been the main battleground for the sovietbacked 
government and usbacked guerrillas trying to topple it and set up 
an interim government in the city 
the rebels failed to take jalalabad 45 miles from pakistan 
after nearly 10 weeks of the most intense bombardment of the war in 
april and may government troops then pushed the guerrillas back 
along the main highway that leads to pakistan beyond the strategic 
crossroads of samarkhel 
local officials took reporters to samarkhel nine miles southeast 
of jalalabad which government forces captured from the guerrillas 
in midjune it had been the most significant gain of the rebels 
who call themselves mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
there were no sounds of gunfire in samarkhel and government 
soldiers lounged under the few trees seeking shelter from the 
noonday sun and smoking an occasional cigarette 
on the yellow shellpocked wall of a building once used as a 
transport office were scrawled the words interim government of 
afghanistan the hero mujahedeen of afghanistan 
an arch over the road said long live the afghansoviet 
friendship 
government officials refused to show reporters the samarkhel 
garrison at the foot of a rocky ridge about 2 miles away for what 
they said were strategic reasons although the government claims its 
troops occupy the garrison the guerrillas claim it is a nomans 
land 
the ridge itself is the last natural line of defense preventing 
the government from moving on the main guerrilla areas nearer to the 
pakistani border lt gen manok mangall governor of nangarhar 
province which includes jalalabad said the important and 
significant spots were in government hands but western reporters 
on the trip said they had climbed the ridge recently with the 
guerrillas who controlled it 
the guerrillas say controlling this ridge will enable them to 
launch a successful offensive against the samarkhelbased government 
troops once they restock their weapons and ammunition supplies the 
loss of samarkhel has made it infinitely more difficult for the 
guerrillas to accurately launch their main shortrange missiles 
against jalalabad and its airport 
in recent weeks the airports gravel runway has been repaired 
and reporters flew to jalalabad on a fixedwing antonov 32 rather 
than by helicopter but the flight was at night in complete 
blackout to minimize risks of a mujahedeen attack 
mangall who is chairman of the afghan defense council said 
there were 12000 armed guerrillas in nangarhar now but twothirds 
were not fighting 
every night i am negotiating with two or three guerrilla 
commanders he said most of them are tired of war 
the highly decorated general said the guerrillas have given up 
their plan to transfer their interim government to jalalabad from 
pakistan and the reconstruction of jalalabad is accelerating 
at bayazid roshan university and the nangarhar teachers training 
institute which reopened last month after a threemonth break 
classes were very small and many classrooms were empty 
a small nucleus of shops have reopened but in the crowded 
marketplace three out of four shops remained shuttered a sign of 
continuing uncertainty about the future 
the sounds of outgoing artillery fire and missiles and even a few 
incoming rockets are largely ignored but the effects of the 840000 
rockets and other heavy artillery which mangall said had hit 
jalalabad during 42 days at the height of the siege are not 
forgotten 
during a brief shopping tour in the bazaar 22yearold takar 
who lost three members of his family in rocket attacks five months 
ago heard there was an american journalist around and stopped his 
bicycle to say 
i hate the american government because they are assisting 
opposition groups in our city they are killing our people we want 
peace to come to afghanistan 
at the teachers training school 18yearold adilla dehquanzadeh 
said she wanted to ask president bush why the americans are arming 
the mujahedeen 
if i met him i would ask him not to equip the opposition with 
new weapons not to kill our innocent people especially our 
children and to support national reconciliation she said

christian and syrian forces battled with 
rockets and artillery on saturday but a police spokesman said 
hostilities have diminished since a soviet envoy began a peace 
mission in the ravaged country 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules 
said two people were killed and nine wounded in the clashes scores 
of shells and rockets crashed in residential neighborhoods on both 
sides of beiruts dividing green line 
the new casualties brought the overal toll to 796 killed and 
2231 wounded since fighting broke out march 8 between the 
traditionally prowestern christians and syrian troops 
the spokesman noted that the exchanges were limited to two 
areas which reflects the noticeable decrease in the intensity and 
scope of the shelling duels since soviet envoy gennady tarasov 
began his mission on wednesday 
it was moscows first direct mediation in lebanon since the civil 
war broke out in april 1975 
tarasov visited syria moscows chief arab ally where he met 
with foreign minister farouk alsharaa on wednesday he drove to 
beirut thursday and met for two days with moslem and christian 
leaders including gen michel aoun commander of christian army 
units with whom syria has refused to negotiate a peace settlement 
tarasov who heads the middle east department at the soviet 
foreign ministry returned to damascus on friday and was expected to 
fly home this weekend for consultations with kremlin leaders 
his mission coincided with a french naval buildup off lebanon 
paris said it sent a sixship flotilla to the eastern 
mediterranean on a humanitarian mission to evacuate 7000 french 
nationals if the situation worsens 
but syrias moslem allies and the fundamentalist hezbollah or 
party of god said the move was tantamount to a military 
intervention and vowed to attack any vessel that approaches the 
coast 
after his meeting with aoun on friday tarasov said the soviet 
union strongly believes there are no military solutions to the 
lebanese problems 
aoun a spokesman said expressed to tarasov his full readiness 
to cooperate with the soviet effort 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said tarasov 
was working on a formula for stabilizing the security 
situation and lifting the blockade imposed by syria and its allies 
on the 310squaremile christian heartland 
asked whether aoun would accept the deployment of observers at 
christian ports to prevent arms supplies form reaching aoun as 
demanded by the moslems the source said would the other side 
accept observers to prevent the flow of weapons from syria 
a moslem source said the soviet diplomatic effort did not 
contradict the deployment of french warships in the mediterranean 
the soviet effort is the carrot and the french naval buildup is 
the stick the source said also insisting on anonymity 
he said the french flotilla in the mediterranean was a 
message to the syrians and their allies that storming the 
christian enclave is not permitted he said the soviets agree 
with that

highwire artist philippe petit walked a tightrope 
soaring over paris to the second level of the eiffel tower on 
saturday and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have 
too much fun 
with a brisk breeze blowing off the seine river petit leaped 
onto the rope at the palais de chaillot and walked 2300 feet on a 
cord set at a 16degree angle to the eiffel towers second level 
330 feet above the sidewalk 
thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length 
of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three 
pencils occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower 
on his balancing bar was a copy of the declaration of the rights 
of man the enduring statement of social justice and liberty that 
emerged from the french revolution in 1789 
my head was full of pure and beautiful things i felt a 
profound joy almost like a child an engulfing elation petit 
said afterward looking windswept and tired but triumphant 
the hardest part was not letting my joy surpass the control i 
needed to continue i was invaded by a joy that was almost dangerous 
because i had my life in my hands 
with wellwishers and the press on hand petit announced that his 
next walk would be across the grand canyon next summer 
petit known for his dangerous walks between the towers of notre 
dame cathedral and new yorks world trade center slid down a 
gossamer thin rope to the second floor of the eiffel tower and 
delivered the declaration text into the hands of paris mayor jacques 
chirac 
his slender 5foot7inch frame was decked out at the beginning 
in a silver jumpsuit with sky blue scarves dangling from his arms 
and legs 
early on in the walk he stripped off the costume by french 
couturier thierry mugler and was left in a multicolored body 
stocking that made him look like a small exotic bird against the 
blue sky 
he lay down carelessly dangling a leg off the wire he stopped 
to admire the monuments of paris he waved his arms and kicked his 
feet 
magnifique formidable super bubbled 8yearold joanna 
bosc who added that she enjoyed the show 
eighteenyearold fleur saltes came 60 miles from the town of 
meaux to see the spectacle and said it was worth the trip 
it was really scary because of the wind but it ended 
wonderfully she said 
the walk was the highlight of celebrations marking the 
bicentennial of the declaration of the rights of man 
partying continued saturday night at a concert sponsored by 
president francois mitterrand under the monumental cube of the new 
arche de la defense

after months in a political coma mayor edward i 
kochs underdog candidacy for a fourth term is showing signs of 
life but with the democratic primary a little more than two weeks 
away its far from clear that hes overtaken the man seeking to 
become the citys first black mayor 
koch has cut back on his wellknown acerbic rhetoric is spending 
200000 a week on television commercials and has been seeking out 
other political leaders 
ed koch keeps publicly and privately pleading for my support 
herman badillo a prominent hispanic political leader and former 
congressman said last week david dinkins hasnt called 
dinkins the manhattan borough president is kochs chief 
opponent in the sept 12 democratic primary and while badillo 
hasnt made his endorsement yet his preference seems clear the 
first rule of politics he said is that youve got to ask 
koch has been doing a lot of asking this summer most of it with 
his trademark unselfconsciousness and his efforts seem to be paying 
off 
what we had to do was make the turnaround wed been in a 
descending posture to say the least for at least a year said 
david garth kochs longtime strategist now its a very close 
race between dinkins and koch 
but dinkins still leads in the polls and some analysts say the 
mayor remains a hobbled candidate 
two polls of likely voters last week showed dinkins at 42 
percent with koch getting 33 percent or 34 percent the other two 
democrats were in the single digits with about 10 percent undecided 
koch had to burp up a little bit because he couldnt get any 
lower than he was said norman adler a consultant for the 
teamsters union which backs dinkins the mayors worst enemy is 
not dinkins its the mayor 
the two other democrats are comptroller harrison j goldin and 
former transit chief richard ravitch contestants for the republican 
nomination are former federal prosecutor rudolph w giuliani and 
cosmetics heir and former ambassador ronald lauder 
unpopularity dogs koch he suffers from concern over soaring 
crime drug abuse and longrunning corruption scandals voters 
express fatigue with his nearly 12year tenure in april 58 percent 
wished he would not run 
yet koch knows how to court the electorate the mainstay of his 
recovery has been a steady diet of television advertisements 
200000 a weeks worth since july 1 featuring citizens touting 
his accomplishments 
the mayors image appears only in a small photo at the close the 
effect is to play down kochs personality while playing up his 
experience 
what the mayor has done right is to moderate his rhetoric he 
is talking more about performance he is not engaging in any 
personal attacks said paul crotty his campaign manager he 
says he is a kinder gentler koch and he has been for the better 
part of the year 
koch still would likely lose a kindandgentle contest with 
dinkins understated noncombative dinkins has spent more time 
collecting endorsements than dueling opponents 
for dinkins the unacknowledged campaign slogan for the last 
six months is operative for the last three weeks slow and steady 
wins the race said mark green an unpaid adviser and former 
democratic candidate for the us senate its neither in dinkins 
character nor the campaigns need to throw a lot of lastsecond hail 
mary passes 
dinkins has sharpened his style somewhat charging koch with 
divisiveness and mismanagement and painting him in a television ad 
as a patron of housing for the wealthy but dinkins message 
overall remains mild one ads tag line proclaims you dont have 
to be loud to be strong 
the approach has its critics dinkins has just been too weak a 
candidate said badillo who has had fallingsout with both 
dinkins and koch in past political wars hes been too timid hes 
not been effective and hes taken the hispanic community for 
granted 
although ethnic politics have not played a dominant role each 
candidate has sought to expand his base an ad for dinkins stresses 
his support for israel and his criticism of islamic minister louis 
farrakhan koch who is jewish has ads that are peopled heavily 
with blacks and hispanics 
were counting on a healthy proportion of the africanamerican 
vote said david fishlow spokesman for dinkins but we also 
have lots of white and hispanic areas targeted for getoutthevote 
operations 
getting out the vote is key in the primary dinkins with strong 
union support expects 7000 volunteers to hand out literature work 
the telephones and take voters to the polls koch expects 2000 
volunteers 
david dinkins does have a tactical advantage on election day 
because he does have troops on the other hand we have a tactical 
advantage in our incumbency said crotty weve always believed 
that as you got closer and closer to the primary koch would look 
better and better

communist party chief milos jakes 
on saturday rejected the type of reforms embraced by hungary and 
poland and condemned foreign activists who participated in recent 
antigovernment demonstrations 
at a rally milos jakes said the party cannot allow the 
weakening of the leading role of the communists the official ctk 
news agency reported 
while no country was directly mentioned jakes comments clearly 
were meant to draw the line between czechoslovakia and the two 
soviet bloc countries implementing the most daring reforms hungary 
and poland 
both have committed themselves to a multiparty system and 
increasingly favor freemarket economics in poland the first 
noncommunist prime minister in the soviet bloc took office last 
week 
on the foreign protesters jakes condemned the misuse of visits 
to czechoslovakia for interference in our internal affairs as it 
was demonstrated on aug 21 said ctk 
prague riot police dispersed thousands of demonstrators aug 21 
the 21st anniversary of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that crushed 
attempts to liberalize communism in ways that resemble some present 
soviet polish and hungarian reforms 
state news media said 370 people were detained including 50 
foreigners 
at the rally saturday at banska bystrica 300 miles east of 
prague politburo member ignac janak condemned actions of 
socalled tourists from hungary poland italy and some other 
countries ctk reported 
the communist party daily rude pravo said they did not behave 
as normal tourists such as come to prague by the millions every 
year therefore a punishment must come 
the rude pravo commentary appeared directed at two hungarian 
activists the government said thursday that the rest of those 
detained had been released 
the two identified as tamas deutsch and gyoergy kereny of 
hungarys fidesz political opposition group unfurled a banner at 
the demonstration proclaiming bolsheviks came with tanks we come 
with flowers kereny also addressed the crowd before his arrest 
ctk said the two would be tried for committing an offense against 
the public order it did not say what the maximum sentence could be 
the hungarian news agency mti in a report from budapest said 
the two were informed at the prague city jail that they would be 
tried also present were the hungarian consul and a josef lzicar an 
attorney known for his defense of prominent human rights advocate 
vaclav havel 
both men submitted a formal complaint against their arrest and 
the hungarian embassy in prague guaranteed the two would appear at 
trial said mti diplomatic sources said however that the two 
remained in custody 
in budapest hundreds of fidesz supporters gathered in front of 
the czechoslovak embassy to protest the decision to try the two and 
spokesmen said the group would continue the vigil 
janak also criticized hungarian tv for airing interviews critical 
of the soviet military intervention with officially disgraced 
czechoslovaks on the night of the anniversary 
among those interviewed were the architect of the reforms former 
communist party leader alexander dubcek and havel a prominent 
member of the charter 77 human rights monitoring organization 
good neighborly relations the spirit of mutual trust respect 
and understanding are not built in a way demonstrated to us 
constantly by some foreign political journalists of hungarian 
television janak said 
when it aired initially in april the dubcek interview drew 
strong protest from the czechoslovak leadership which took power 
after the sovietled invasion 
hungary was one of five warsaw pact countries that participated 
in the invasion but its communist leadership has been the only one 
within the pact to call the military intervention a mistake

while the ptls deposed leader struggles 
in a federal courtroom the rev sam johnson faces a different 
battle rebuilding the image of the church that was left behind 
i sometimes envy the ministries that werent affected by the 
ptl mess said johnson now the pastor of heritage church which 
has moved from the 2300acre ptl park near here to three concrete 
buildings in a lowermiddleclass neighborhood some ministries 
were affected by the scandal but we were the scandal we were the 
eye of the storm 
heritage church was founded by jim bakker whose trial on fraud 
and conspiracy charges begins this week in federal court the jury 
was selected last week 
richard dortch bakkers top assistant from 1984 to 1987 already 
has pleaded guilty to four fraud and conspiracy charges and was 
sentenced last week to eight years in prison and a 200000 fine 
it was dortch who asked johnson then ptls executive in charge 
of missions for a 10000 loan to handle a kook who was 
threatening the ministry 
the kook turned out to be jessica hahn whose tryst with 
bakker in 1980 eventually led to the television evangelists 
resignation from ptl in march 1987 dortch investigations showed 
arranged a payoff of 265000 in ministry funds to buy her silence 
the 10000 loan landed johnson a seat before the federal grand 
jury that investigated ptl for 16 months before indicting bakker 
dortch and james and david taggart two former bakker assistants 
who have been convicted of tax evasion and face up to 25 years in 
prison and 1 million in fines each in sentencing scheduled sept 8 
johnson who left ptl in disgust one month after bakker resigned 
was not indicted he later returned to take over heritage church 
the church johnson said last week has been badly battered by 
the ptl fall 
the television ministry is struggling to carry on nightly 
broadcasts last wednesday the church rented an extra hour of 
satellite time to appeal for funds and said the television shows may 
be off the air soon in new york los angeles and other major markets 
as for the numbers attending services in person johnson avoids 
comparison figures but the churchs former sanctuary was about 
three times the size of the one the congregation has now johnson 
instead compares the church to samson of the bible 
his eyes were poked out his hair had been cut off he had lost 
his beauty johnson said of the old testament character but his 
hair grew back and the spirit returned to him and the last verse of 
that story is important it says he killed more philistines in that 
final day than his entire life before 
he came back from the lowest point of his life to a great 
victory said johnson a bible school classmate of bakkers 
prosecutors contend that bakker and other ptl executives diverted 
4 million in donations to the ministry to support fancy homes 
designer clothing and lavish travel 
three months after bakker resigned ptl was put under bankruptcy 
protection and the church was left to face his disenchanted former 
supporters 
the bitterness was heaped on us from time to time johnson 
said 
prosecutors say ptl raised 158 million between 1984 and 1987 
through lifetime partnerships that promised supporters three 
nights lodging per year for life in the hotels being constructed at 
heritage usa ptls expansive retreat near here 
prosecutors say the money was diverted to support the bakkers 
plush lifestyle in those years bakker and his wife tammy faye 
drew 35 million in bonuses plus other perks 
i do not believe that people begrudge them the salaries though 
they were excessive johnson said and i think people could 
forgive him for the jessica hahn thing 
but what hurt the most were the broken promises johnson 
said thats what brought the bitterness the hurt among those who 
believed in the ministry 
in the churchs new surroundings there is no heritage grand 
hotel no covered shopping mall no sprawling water park 
its an old gymnasium johnson said looking out at the rows 
of folding chairs 
were back to the basics here were not about buildings and 
land and water parks here but the spirit is with us 
the church bought the folding chairs six television cameras and 
a broadcast truck from stephen mernick the canadian businessman who 
bought heritage usa through the bankruptcy court mernick sold the 
equipment at a bargain johnson said helping the ministry to stay 
on the airwaves 
the move from bakkers dream resort came from necessity johnson 
said but it may have symbolic value in showing to journalists and 
others drawn here by the bakker trial that the church is no longer 
bakkers church 
were hoping that when they come here theyll see this is not 
the same place that theres a different spirit here now johnson 
said

the evangelical lutheran church in america 
lashed out saturday at widespread sexual harassment of women and 
called on congregations to make sure their churches are free of such 
mistreatment 
at one point at the churchs governing assembly women who had 
experienced harassment were asked to stand and about 40 of 
aproximately 300 women among 1000 delegates did so 
the rev judith gerlitz of new york city said that while sexual 
harassment and abuse has spread in the country the church has 
done little about it 
some denominations have done surveys finding the problem 
extensive even among church personnel and have initiated 
countermeasures the assembly here added its stern voice on the 
matter 
the church will not tolerate any forms of sexual abuse or 
harassment by any of its personnel the assembly declared and 
pledged to make our church a safe place for all persons by 
moving firmly against such abuses 
the 53millionmember denomination called for looking into the 
problem at various church levels and creation of procedures for 
victims to report incidents and also to provide healing for 
victims 
sexual violence of many kinds is widespread in our society 
including sexual harassment on the job rape and sexual assault 
incest and child abuse the resolution said 
it estimated twofifths of working women have been sexually 
harassed and a third of children sexually abused before 18 
such abuses betray gods creation inflict grievous suffering 
and rend the fabric of the whole community of the people of 
god the church said 
another action saluted the 20th anniversary of the start of 
ordination of women in the three lutheran branches merged into the 
present denomination it has about 1000 ordained women among 11000 
clergy 
congregations that have not experienced the preaching teaching 
or pastoral care of women were encouraged to open doors to them 
active recruitment was urged of women for seminaries and ordination 
the church has made a commitment not to keep a separate role of 
silent and secondclass women said christine myers crist 
executive director of the churchs commission for women 
that means she told the assembly bringing the unheard 
unheeded voices of women into full participation some feel that 
is to try to destroy men she said no way 
in a report she noted that 60 percent of the churchs members 
are women recalling the example of jesus in regard to women the 
report said 
barriers against women were woven into the fabric of the 
society in which jesus lived but jesus reached across all those 
barriers against women ignoring rules against them putting 
scriptures back in their hands 
he appeared first to women as witnesses to his resurrection 
the report said 
the assembly is the first since the 1988 merger of the lutheran 
church in america the american lutheran church and the association 
of evangelical lutheran churches 
the eightday assembly runs through wednesday

the civil rights convictions of white supremacists 
david lane and bruce pierce in the murder of radio talk show host 
alan berg have been upheld by a federal appeals court 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals rejected the defendants 
arguments that they participated in bergs murder because they hated 
the outspoken broadcaster as an individual and not because he was a 
jew the two had contended their federal civil rights convictions 
and 150year prison sentences should be overturned for that reason 
no reversible error has been demonstrated the appeals court 
said in its decision friday 
the court also rejected other arguments by the defendants 
including that there was insufficient evidence to convict them and 
that their civil rights trial amounted to double jeopardy because 
their earlier racketeering trial included testimony about the berg 
murder 
lane and pierce belonged to a group of white supremacists called 
the order they were convicted by a denver us district court jury 
in november 1987 of violating the civil rights of berg 50 when he 
was gunned down in june 1984 
they were indicted on the civil rights count of interfering with 
a federally protected right resulting in death because there is no 
federal murder charge state prosecutors had decided there was 
insufficient evidence to try the two for murder 
the two along with several others were also convicted of 
federal racketeering charges which included allegations of the berg 
killing in seattle in 1985 their 150year sentences for the denver 
convictions are to follow their racketeering sentences 
pierce was sentenced to 100 years and lane to 40 years for the 
racketeering convictions which were based on their roles in bergs 
death bank robberies and counterfeiting 
witnesses had testified that the murder was triggered by bergs 
onair derision of the defendants rightwing beliefs

the head of the soviet kgb said saturday 
that prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki polands first noncommunist 
leader is a solid man who will succeed in solving the nations 
problems 
also saturday several hundred railroad workers in the city of 
lodz ended their strike at the request of solidarity leader lech 
walesa the workers urged mazowiecki to grant their pay demands 
walesa also met with labor secretary elizabeth dole and senate 
minority leader robert dole rkansas and gave them a letter for 
president bush seeking more us economic aid to help polands 
struggling economy 
party central committee secretary leszek miller meanwhile told 
a meeting of leaders of party committees that they should be loyal 
to the new solidarityled government the staterun pap news service 
reported 
there is no conflict between preserving ideological identity as 
party members and being loyal to the legal state authorities 
miller said 
mazowieckis meeting with kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov was his 
highestlevel contact with a soviet official since the polish leader 
took office last week in a historic transfer of power from the 
communist party 
i liked him kryuchkov told reporters after he emerged 
saturday evening from seeing mazowiecki at the office of the council 
of ministers a solid man 
according to the kgb chairman mazowiecki spoke of his plans for 
polands government while he told mazowiecki about social reforms in 
the soviet union the talks were productive and interesting he 
said 
polands new prime minister knows how to deal with things 
kryuchkov concluded we wished him great success and he will be 
successful 
polish state television later broadcast the first part of the 
meeting on its main evening news i am glad i can see you and that 
i have my first opportunity to talk to a representative of the 
soviet leadership mazowiecki told his guest 
the irony of mazowiecki a longtime solidarity activist and 
former political prisoner receiving at his government office the 
head of the soviet intelligence agency is another example of the 
remarkable changes overtaking poland and the communist world 
it also seemed to underscore the high level of soviet concern as 
it begins adjusting to the new reality 
kryuchkov turned up without prior public announcement saturday 
and first met with communist president wojciech jaruzelski and the 
acting interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak whom mazowiecki 
replaced as prime minister kiszczak then accompanied kryuchkov to 
the meeting with mazowiecki 
on friday mazowiecki met with the soviet unions ambassador to 
poland vladimir brovikov one day after he took office 
the installation of a noncommunistled government in poland has 
been greeted with concern but apparent acceptance in moscow 
although many of the practical ramifications have not been worked 
out 
mazowiecki has said that under his solidarityled government the 
communist party will retain the defense and interior ministries and 
that poland will maintain its obligations to the warsaw pact and 
comecon the east bloc economic alliance 
but it has not been made clear if mazowiecki as prime minister 
will have access to sensitive state secrets concerning for 
instance warsaw pact defense strategies or if he will sit in on 
all the discussions at the annual full warsaw pact summits 
poland is the soviet unions largest and most strategic east bloc 
ally linking it to east germany the frontline state facing the 
nato states in the west 
the kgb the committee for state security controls the secret 
police intelligence gathering and border defense for the soviet 
union kryuchkov has been chairman since last year and has brought 
an unprecedented openness to the post undergoing questioning from 
soviet legislators and granting several press interviews 
before meeting kryuchkov mazowiecki flew by helicopter to the 
southern shrine city of czestochowa for annual ceremonies honoring 
the black madonna polands most revered icon at the jasna gora 
monastery 
a meeting of the nations roman catholic bishops was taking place 
at the monastery mazowiecki is the first practicing catholic to 
lead the government in postwar poland a country in which more than 
90 percent of the people consider themselves catholic 
in other developments saturday 
railroad workers in lodz under pressure from walesa ended a 
oneday strike and sent an appeal to mazowiecki our premier 
asking him to satisfy their pay demands 
the conclusion of the railroad strike at 1201 am followed an 
appeal by walesa that the new prime minister be given a chance to 
begin to work walesa said mazowieckis election was a 
breakthrough not to be wasted 
abandoning the strike rail workers said in a statement was a 
proof of our support and trust for mazowiecki the strike by 
several hundreds workers had shut down all local train service 
walesa met in gdansk with the doles who delivered a letter of 
greeting from bush 
i am very satisfied walesa said after the meeting in the 
united states there is great interest in poland now and i hope 
these visits which are so numerous recently will help encouraged 
investors to get involved in poland 
he said he was giving the doles a letter for bush asking for 
increased us economic involvement in poland to match the faster 
pace of reforms going on 
but mrs dole said after the meeting she did not foresee 
immediate financial aid beyond the 119 million that bush offered 
during a visit to poland in july of course as we can and when we 
can we will hope to increase that aid she said

the communist partys central committee on saturday 
harshly criticized nationalist activists in the baltic republics 
saying they are leading the restive region into an abyss 
the official message from the partys policymaking body accused 
separatist elements of whipping up nationalist hysteria in 
latvia lithuania and estonia and appealed for an end to their push 
for secession 
the message came three days after more than 1 million residents 
of the baltic region linked hands in a giant chain to protest the 
sovietnazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the soviet annexation 
of the three states 
the sharply worded appeal showed clear concern in the highest 
councils of the soviet leadership about the possibility of the 
beginning of the breakup of the soviet union a nation of many 
ethnic groups 
the statement was read as the top item on the nightly news 
program vremya and carried by the official tass news agency 
things have gone far serious danger is threatening the baltic 
people the central committee said people should know what 
abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward 
in an apparent reference to economic problems the message 
continued if they managed to attain their goals the consequences 
could be catastrophic for their peoples their very ability to 
survive could come under question 
the central committee also criticized the three republics 
government and party leaders saying some did not try hard enough to 
stop the slide toward separatism and others played up to the 
nationalist mood and weakened their opposition to separatist plans 
grassroots baltic groups have turned during the past weeks to 
more and more active agitation for full independence for their small 
republics 
their increasingly open calls for secession have brought 
counterattacks in the central soviet press but saturdays central 
committee message was moscows sharpest response so far 
the central committee condemned the antisocialist antisoviet 
thrust of the baltic activists and said they were working against 
the common interests of the soviet people 
in initial reaction baltic activists said the appeal would not 
divert them from their drive for independence 
the message wont have any particular effect because it doesnt 
include any concrete steps said ulo kaevats of the estonian 
peoples front i see it as an expression of weakness and of a 
policy that is not very rational

the government is investigating whether private 
security companies from israel helped train assassination squads for 
colombian drug lords a foreign ministry official said saturday 
an israeli reserve officer whom news reports have linked to such 
activities said he had actually been teaching cattlemen how to 
protect themselves from communist guerrillas 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu speaking on israel 
radio said israel had set up a special investigating committee 
without being requested to do so by either colombia or the united 
states 
colombia and the united states launched a major drive to break up 
the drugtrafficking underworld in colombia after drug bosses there 
had a presidential candidate killed last week 
the medellin drug cartel supplies most of the cocaine sold in the 
united states 
two days ago we asked the colombian government at the request 
of foreign minister moshe arens for any information available to 
them and we have offered them assistance with anything we can do 
netanyahu said 
we need to find out if israelis indeed are involved and 
what we can do to make sure that they are not he added 
the israeli government made the request after american news 
reports that some israelis were helping colombian drug cartels train 
assassination squads 
the foreign ministry official said israel would take action 
against anyone found to have violated israeli laws 
he had said friday that israel may revoke passports of any 
israeli mercenaries proven to be involved in training assassination 
squads 
lt col yair klein identified as an israeli trainer of such 
squads on the basis of videotape broadcast by the nbc news returned 
to israel on friday from miami 
the 44yearold israeli is a retired commander of a paratroop 
antiterror unit and president of a private security firm called 
spearhead 
i trained a group of farmers who defended themselves against 
terrorist organizations mostly the group called m19 a guerrilla 
group with the goal of turning colombia into cuba or nicaragua 
klein said on israeli television friday 
a senior defense ministry official said klein is likely to be 
questioned about his activities in colombia the television said 
that the ministry is considering filing a police complaint 
however israeli television and major dailies last week 
identified klein as the leader of four israeli army reserve colonels 
reported to have worked with the colombian drug traffickers 
klein said saturday on armed forces radio that his company 
trained colombian cattlemen and that the video in which he was shown 
was made by spearhead for advertising purposes 
he said the company completed its training a year ago and that 
his last visit to colombia was four months ago klein said that 
visit had nothing to do with the training program but he did not 
say exactly why he went

a magazine said saturday that 
federal prosecutors are preparing to charge a former us soldier 
with treason for his alleged role in a spy ring that sold nato 
secrets to the soviets 
the hamburgbased der spiegel magazine said it would be the first 
time in west german history that a foreigner faced such charges 
according to the spiegel report federal prosecutors in karlsruhe 
are concluding an investigation and preparing to charge clyde lee 
conrad with high treason 
conrad remains in investigative custody in a west german prison 
following his arrest in august 1988 
under west german law the 42yearold former soldier would face 
a maximum 10year prison sentence if convicted on spying charges 
however he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted of 
high treason 
the federal prosecutors office in karlsruhe was closed saturday 
and officials could not be reached immediately to comment on the 
report 
der spiegel did not say when conrad would be charged 
in february prosecutors said their investigation of conrad had 
showed that nato strategies were damaged more than they thought when 
he was arrested 
authorities suspect conrad acted as ringleader of an 
international spy network that sold the soviets information about 
the western alliances nuclear missiles bases and troop strengths 
prosecutors believe conrad who had access to secret documents 
before retiring from the army in 1985 collected more than 1 
million for peddling the secrets 
spiegel said the former sergeant is suspected of selling the 
soviets secret rocket codes for nuclear weapons on west german soil 
conrad was in charge of keeping classified nato documents which 
were held in a safe at the bad kreuznach base 
news reports at the time of conrads arrest said he had hired 
other us soldiers to obtain information the material was was 
passed by couriers to a hungarian intelligence officer in vienna 
austria and then on to the soviets according to the reports

it could be tough to find a tow truck in 
rhode island on sunday unless the breakdown is somewhere between 
the warwick mall and the rocky point amusement park 
tow truck drivers and rigs from nine states are scheduled to 
parade between the two sites hoping to gain a little more respect 
from drivers who equate calling a tow truck with visiting the 
dentist for root canal work 
its basically an awareness thing said lou pucino of pucino 
brothers of rhode island his east greenwich company is a 
majorleague towing operation with 10 trucks that can handle 
everything from volkswagens to buses 
sure you say i dont get enough respect for the work you 
do we do too pucino said people ridicule us a lot in tough 
situations 
pucino presides over the rhode island towing association this 
year and decided it was time to show off when the association 
shifted its annual family outing from a massachusetts farm to rocky 
point he said he thought of the parade something towing 
associations in other states also have done 
pucino said he expects nearly 100 gleaming trucks with their 
lights flashing and uniformed drivers to roll along in formation 
a lot of people dont realize how sophisticated our business 
has become pucino said as cars have become more sophisticated 
so has our equipment there are no hooks on tow trucks anymore 
the new gentler tow truck now uses a sling that slides under the 
wheels and lets a car ride on its own suspension he said 
a small towing rig can cost 35000 he said and the price of 
some of the larger ones if you have to ask you cant afford it 
we want the people to realize that we are not putting the money 
under our mattresses were spending it on men and equipment he 
said 
the towing association has 85 members out of about 110 licensed 
towers in rhode island but all this sophistication should mean that 
motorists wont have to steam on the highway while the tow drivers 
enjoy a clambake 
we all have radios nowadays and cellular phones everybodys 
in touch pucino said so hopefully well be able to provide the 
service on sunday

what started as the nostalgic whimsy of 
three friends has become a corporate extravaganza of 3000 real and 
fancied cowpokes 300 covered wagons and 4000 cattle that will roll 
across montana next month 
its an old west cattle drive like the old west never saw a 
statesanctioned event to celebrate montanas 100th anniversary in a 
vaguely authentic recreation of the days of the open range 
cold beer and entertainment every night and no rustlers 
the great montana centennial cattle drive is just one of scores 
of events sanctioned by the montana centennial commission but it 
stands alone for its grandiose scope gaudy exuberance and bigtime 
price tag 
officials of the nonprofit latigo corp established to organize 
the drive estimate the cost at anywhere from 400000 to 1 
million depending on variables such as the fees for countrywestern 
talent who will entertain at the wagon train each night grammy 
award winner lee greenwood headlines the final concert in billings 
sept 9 
the drive begins on labor day at the little town of roundup 
chosen as the origin partly for its name 
it will roll southward 60 miles in a leisurely six days from the 
banks of the musselshell river through the bull mountains across 
the prairie ending near the yellowstone river at the livestock 
auctions of billings thats about the same pace as the cattle 
drives of 100 years ago 
about 100 drovers experienced cowhands have been hired to 
drive the main herd and a separate lead herd of some 300 longhorns 
the wagon train will follow with its mixture of dudes 
nostalgists and adventurers ranging from celebrities such as 
television magnate ted turner to wouldbe westerners from as far 
away as japan and australia 
the youngest drover is 13yearold turk stovall of billings who 
has worked cattle since he was 2 
this drive will not be of the hollywood cowboy school but 
rather a 1989 drive which will honor and pay tribute to all the 
great drives of the past said western cartoonist stan lynde an 
originator of the idea 
billings officials will close some streets for the herd when it 
arrives and us 87 south of roundup will be closed to traffic for 
two days 
it is a federal route but this is an extraordinary event 
said roger scott division administrator for the federal highway 
administration there has never been a cattle drive like this 
the basic plan as conceived by cartoonists lynde and barry 
mcwilliams and a friend jim wempner was to recreate an oldtime 
drive and let the public help drive the cattle to market then sell 
the herd and go home 
it sounded so simple 
the original goal was 10000 cattle and 5000 riders but that 
proved too ambitious a goal for the drive which for a time bogged 
down in logistics and personalities and almost died 
some of the financing and organization show ingenious modern 
twists 
when nelson story brought the first great herd from texas to 
montana in 1866 he paid the cowboys to help him as latigo is 
paying the drovers 
but the nonprofessional riders who want to come on the 
centennial drive are paying latigo 130 to 150 for meal tickets 
plus 25 to feed their horses and contributing a cow to the herd 
besides if they dont have a cow latigo will rent them one same 
with the horses 
nelson story hired a cook latigo hired two catering companies 
and in 1866 nelson story never told his cowboys to bring 
sunblock and bug spray 
though authenticity is not a major goal of the celebration 
participants are not allowed to wear baseballstyle caps tennis 
shoes or brightcolored jeans backpacker tents will be allowed only 
if their colorful modern fabric is hidden by plain canvas 
any profit from the drive will go to a fund to provide 
scholarships for rural montana youngsters and economic development 
projects two foundations have pledged 2 million in matching funds 
other moneymaking devices include sale of licenses to identify 
products with the drive an auction of donated art and western items 
and the countrywestern concert

to the somber cadence of muffled drums an 
estimated 35000 people marched saturday upon the supreme court and 
congress to protest what naacp director benjamin l hooks called 
the legal lynching of black americas hope to become full 
partners in the american dream 
the march aimed at spurring legislative remedies for four 
recent civil rights decisions by the high court was fashioned in 
tone and dress after the historic silent march 72 years ago in 
new york city as then men wore black and women and children wore 
white as then the marchers kept their lips sealed throughout the 
procession 
the 1917 march of 8000 people led by web dubois down fifth 
avenue elevated the 8yearold national association for the 
advancement of colored people to the forefront of the thenfledgling 
civil rights movement saturdays event which drew nearly every 
major civil rights leader in the nation may have restored that 
standing for an organization which lately has been criticized within 
the black community as staid and ineffective 
for an organization thats dead we did pretty good didnt 
we beamed hooks as he looked upon the throng which gathered at 
the east front of the capitol for a rally after the silent march 
hooks claimed a turnout of 135000 people police estimates were 
far smaller the us park police put the number of marchers at 
35000 the us capitol police said the crowd at the rally was 
18500 
more than 200 civic church and labor organizations had joined 
the naacp in sponsoring the march individuals joining hooks on the 
speakers dais included the rev jesse jackson aflcio president 
lane kirkland joseph lowery president of the sourthern christian 
leadership conference dorothy height president of the black 
leadership forum and dozens of others 
we come presenting our bodies in silent protest in a manner 
used in 1917 to protest the brutal lynching of black americans in 
this nation said hooks it is ironic that 72 years later we 
find ourselves marching once more to protest the legal lynching of 
black americas hope for a chance to become full partners in the 
american dream 
the five justices who voted on four separate occasions to roll 
back the clock on civil rights by their actions have unraveled the 
ropes used by black americans to climb out of the valleys of 
economic segregation 
in the view of civil rights lawyers the four decisions this year 
seriously cut into the modern legal gains of minorities 
particularly employment rights in one case patterson vs mclean 
credit union the court sharply limited the power of minority men 
and women to sue private parties including schools for 
discrimatory practices similarly the courts decision in richmond 
vs j a croson co was seen as diluting job setaside programs 
guaranteeing certain percentages of municipal projects to minority 
subcontractors and other affirmative action plans 
march organizers also assailed the decision in martin vs wilks 
which allowed white firefighters in birmingham ala to attack a 
consent decree calling for the promotion of blacks as a case of 
reverse discrimination the fourth ruling wards cove vs 
antonio was criticized as shifting the entire burden of proof in 
job discrimination cases to the victims of employer bias 
kirkland told the rally at the capitol that the unions march 
today because we believe discrimination cannot be eradicated from 
our society until there is equal employment opportunity for all 
americans 
the supreme court has often been the target of major 
demonstrations in the capital in recent years an estimated 325000 
turned out last spring to urge the court to stand by its 1973 
decision legalizing abortion however the court weeks later 
softened that ruling in a case seen as a victory for antiabortion 
forces

polls published saturday indicated us rep barney 
franks constituents still strongly support him despite revelations 
about the congressmans relationship with a male prostitute 
the state republican party meanwhile called for the 
massachusetts democrats resignation but political observers 
predicted frank who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in 
1987 would survive the scandal 
on friday frank 49 acknowledged he had once paid for sex with 
a man he identified as steve gobie then hired him as a personal 
aide in an effort to wean him from a life of drugs and prostitution 
frank said he fired gobie when he became suspicious that the man was 
selling sex from franks capitol hill apartment 
frank said he had been victimized and predicted voters would 
not hold the incident against him 
the polls and a tradition of tolerance in massachusetts 
appear to back him up 
a poll of 400 registered voters in franks district conducted 
friday night for the boston globe and wbztv showed 653 percent did 
not think frank should resign while 223 percent did about 12 
percent had no opinion or refused to answer 
the boston herald and wcvbtv polled 300 of franks constituents 
and 56 percent said frank has performed well enough as a 
congressman to deserve reelection while 29 percent called for his 
ouster five percent said their view depends on who opposes frank in 
1990 
both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent 
after publicly acknowledging his homosexuality frank won 
election to his fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote in 
the states 4th district encompassing some boston suburbs and parts 
of southeastern massachusetts 
it would be worse if it were some kind of a money scandal his 
sex life is well known so it came as no surprise said robert 
freysigner a political science professor at bradford college in 
haverhill 
the only other member of congress to publicly acknowlege being a 
homosexual is rep gerry studds also a massachusetts democrat 
studds easily won reelection after being censured by the house in 
1983 for an affair 10 years earlier with a 17yearold male house 
page 
the state gop urged frank to resign charging he violated the 
law lied about the situation and showed a profound lack of 
judgment 
alexander tennant the partys executive director said he 
believes voters will absolutely object to barney frank when they 
find out he has been using his public position to help a prostitute 
drug dealer and convicted felon the washington times reported 
friday that gobie had been convicted of obscenity sex and drug 
charges 
but christopher bosso a congressional scholar at northeastern 
university said franks admissions likely would not affect his 
reputation as an effective lawmaker 
power on capitol hill is based on two things seniority and 
support from the voters bosso said barney frank is smart even 
those who disagree with him realize hes one of the smartest members 
on capitol hill

a newly restored version of sergei eisensteins 
1938 film classic alexander nevsky is wowing audiences on a 
world tour that its producer hopes will carry it triumphantly back 
to the soviet union 
id love to take this film home to russia said producer john 
goberman who said he is awaiting an overture from moscow the 
first performance would knock them out theyd be beside 
themselves 
besides eisensteins dramatic blackandwhite photography the 
screen epic about the 13th century defeat of marauding teutonic 
armies by russian forces led by prince nevsky features a rousing 
musical score by composer sergei prokofiev 
a fresh print of eisensteins 107minute movie made from the 
original nitrate negative in the moscow film archive was prepared 
for gobermans concert presentation saturday night at the 
outdoor theater of wolf trap farm park in suburban virginia 
while shown on a 30foot screen over the stage with english 
subtitles displayed on a smaller screen underneath prokofievs 
music was to be performed in sync with the film by the national 
symphony orchestra mezzosoprano janice taylor and a chorus from 
the oratorio society of washington 
the film has two tracks for remastered dialogue and sound 
effects a computer slide track for subtitles and a fourth track 
that feeds cues to the orchestra conductor 
the print is so gorgeous it just glows goberman said it 
will make you fall in love with blackandwhite film all over 
again 
the music was another matter goberman described the faint 
scratchy soundtrack of the original film performed by a 30member 
studio band in one word horrible 
the orchestra was clearly having a bad day with one of the 
greatest film scores ever written he said during a break in 
rehearsals at the kennedy center 
shortly after prokofiev completed the 60minute movie score he 
condensed it into his widely performed 40minute alexander nevsky 
cantata for mezzosoprano chorus and orchestra 
copies of the original movie score are lost so goberman 
recruited musical arranger william d brohn to transcribe the 
missing 20 minutes of music from the original soundtrack for full 
orchestra using the cantata as a framework 
we knocked ourselves out to make this music authentic 
goberman said we even left in prokofievs obvious mistakes we 
took the film and added the music we think is what prokofiev heard 
in his head it is fair to say that almost every note is by 
prokofiev 
goberman who also has produced the awardwinning live from 
lincoln center broadcasts for public television said performances 
of alexander nevsky are booked through next year at the pompeii 
festival in italy toronto san diego and san antonio texas 
the restored version premiered in los angeles in november 1987 
and came to washington after enthusiastic receptions in cleveland 
philadelphia london and hollywood 
eisenstein is reported to have made the film about nevsky a 
legendary russian hero because he had fallen into disfavor and 
needed a popular hit that would please soviet dictator josef stalin 
and his cultural bureaucrats 
for his part stalin embraced nevsky as a valuable piece of 
artistic propaganda to mobilize the soviet people against a 
threatened invasion by nazi germany the movie was shelved after the 
nazisoviet nonaggression pact was signed in 1939 but was eagerly 
shown after the germans invaded two years later 
for his efforts eisenstein was awarded the order of lenin and 
slapped on the back from stalin who reportedly exclaimed sergei 
mikhailovich you are a good bolshevik after all 
goberman rejects the notion that nevsky is esoteric art or a 
mere stalinist propaganda vehicle 
this is a popular film made for audiences to enjoy he said 
this is cowboys and indians only theyre russians and germans it 
was made to get audiences excited and it really does

an army unit and a contra guerrilla 
group drew guns when they met in northern nicaragua but decided to 
hold an informal halfhour peace parley that included an exchange of 
cigarettes 
it was the first known talks between sandinista army and contra 
groups since the signing of a regional accord signed this month in 
honduras to dismantle the nicaraguan rebel force 
an army unit commanded by lt bernardo diaz nearly ran into the 
contra group on a dirt road near the honduran border thursday 
afternoon said photographer ruben farina the only journalist 
present 
diaz shouted for everybody to hit the dirt but at the same 
time he was yelling at the contras that he did not want any 
shooting farina said 
the contras were yelling the same thing that nobody wanted to 
shoot just talk those were pretty tense moments 
eventually after placing safety catches on weapons diaz and the 
leader of the guerrilla squad marlon moreno espinoza apparently 
convinced each other of their good intentions 
the decisive point in lowering the tension was when the 
sandinista soldiers started offering cigarettes to the contras 
said farina who was working for the associated press 
from there on the two sides sort of mingled still being 
careful though and started talking to each other in small 
groups 
rebel commander danilo wilmer peralta had requested a meeting 
thursday morning with a saninista unit near los manchones about 150 
miles north of managua but his detachment failed to show up farina 
said 
the 20 government troopers then moved north they ran into the 30 
contras several hours later at a bend of the road 
farina said the 30minute meeting ended with moreno telling diaz 
that he would consult with peralta and other superiors about 
accepting amnesty and promising to make contact again next week 
diaz gave the contras copies of the accord to dismantle the 
contras signed aug 7 in tela honduras by the presidents of costa 
rica el salvador guatemala honduras and nicaragua 
a un observer group established at the behest of the central 
american presidents is to oversee the dismantling and repatriation 
or relocation an operation that should begin within two weeks and 
be completed by dec 5 
most contras an estimated 10000 have been encamped in 
southern honduras near the nicaraguan border since their leaders 
signed a temporary ceasefire with the nicaraguan government in 
march 1988 but pockets of contras remain in northern nicaragua and 
in central chontales province staging scattered attacks 
diaz commands the sandinista army quilali reserve battallion 
of the 311th brigade moreno heads a contra batallion also called 
quilali 
quilali is the name of a town in northern nueva segovia province 
and the meeting took place about six miles north of the town 
farina said the contras appeared to know little of the regional 
accord which diaz explained to them 
after diaz distributed the copies of the accord the contras 
left looking over their shoulders as they disappeared into the bush 
barricada the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista 
national liberation front on saturday said more than 400 contras 
have left their camps in honduras and are trying to return to 
nicaragua 
the daily quoted jose tomas osorio umanzor whom it described a 
sevenyear contra veteran as saying more than 400 rebels had 
deserted and were wandering around the border trying to enter 
nicaragua 
osorio returned to nicaragua through the nicaraguan border town 
of las manos in nueva segovia province on wednesday according to 
barricada 
the nicaraguan red cross has set up border offices to receive 
nicaraguans who want to return

a miami couple who survived 66 days aboard a life 
raft in the pacific ocean returned home saturday looking for a long 
rest away from the water and their aquatic tormentors 
william butler 59 and simone butler 56 arrived at miami 
international airport after a sevenweek ordeal during which they 
said their boat was sunk by whales and they had to fend off sharks 
and subsist on fresh fish and desalinated sea water 
the couple each more than 50 pounds lighter after the ordeal 
flew from san jose costa rica a week after they were rescued by a 
costa rican coast guard cutter 13 miles off that central american 
nations coast 
its hard to believe that seven days ago we were still adrift 
trying to make landfall butler said really its hard to 
discuss the situation 
butler said the most dangerous day on the covered raft was a day 
he called the shootout at ok corral 
the butlers that afternoon found themselves in the middle of a 
huge school of triggerfish a small feeding fish then came a school 
of porpoises and about 20 to 30 sharks he said 
they all got in a huge feeding frenzy butler said that 
ended only about 3 am the next day 
during the turbulent episode either a porpoise or a shark got 
caught in one of the rafts balast bags and violently threw the 
raft about for a couple of minutes according to butler 
butler a retired exporter looked trim and fit he wore a bushy 
grey beard grown during the sojourn 
mrs butler who lost 67 pounds left the plane in a wheelchair 
but stood up to greet waiting family members and friends and talk 
with reporters 
among those waiting to meet the butlers was their 2monthold 
granddaughter jessica butler who was born after they put to sea 
the couple was hospitalized in costa rica after the rescue 
the first night in the hospital said mrs butler a native 
of france i had a terrible nightmare and didnt know where i 
was it was a terrible two minutes in the dark before i realized 
that i was on land and it was all right 
on may 24 the butlers began a voyage from panama to hawaii in 
their 40foot sailboat 
nearly three weeks out whales apparently seeking to protect 
their young attacked and sank the boat the couple said 
i dont know anything about whale psychology butler said 
but i assume we headed into the whales pack the babies were in 
front the mothers behind then the males 
butler said the male whales attacked the boat ramming its hull 
while making loud chugging sounds like a locomotive the couple 
sent help signals grabbed essentials and jumped into the raft as 
the craft went down in minutes 
they managed to escape with six cans of food including half a 
jar of peanut butter the ships log a puncture repair kit for the 
rubber raft and the crucial fishing line and a portable desalination 
filter 
the canned food held out for 20 days then they lived on fish 
they caught 
the couple said they sighted dozens of ships during their ordeal 
but werent seen by the crews 
the costa rican coast guard spotted the couple floating in their 
life raft aug 19 
were going to rest and go away from the ocean for a while 
to the mountains the prairies butler said 
the lifelong sailor said he plans to resume sailing in about a 
year 
they said they have received various offers for rights to the 
story of their ordeal 
weve already received a lot of offers butler said offers 
for movie rights for tv rights for book rights for 
ghostwriters but weve put that all on hold his wife said

pravda on saturday accused several unofficial 
newspapers that have sprung up under kremlin reforms of using 
western funds to press for the overthrow of the soviet government 
in another attack on liberal trends the communist party daily 
also warned poles that polish communists may have suffered a defeat 
but nobody should write their political obituary 
pravda called for a crackdown on publications that carry 
systematic and vicious attacks on our party and its leadership 
among targets of pravdas censure were papers put out by the 
selfstyled opposition party democratic union an independent 
siberian news agency and unofficial journalists lev timofeyev and 
sergei grigoryants 
their press activities which once would have brought them 
constant harassment and arrests have flourished despite continuing 
obstacles under the kremlins policy of glasnost or more openness 
commentator yuri zhukov listed among his complaints against the 
activist journalists truly blasphemous attacks on lenin 
including pornographic verses 
he denounced cooperation between unofficial journalists and 
western radio and press saying their western support made them the 
equivalent of foreign publications put out without permission on 
soviet territory 
zhukov also accused many of the unofficial publications of 
pirating their paper supplies and the use of copying facilities 
under a law passed july 31 calls for the violent overthrow of 
the soviet government are criminal offenses an earlier version also 
banned statements that discredited the government but it was 
replaced 
on poland prava said extremistminded people are hurrying to 
write off the polish united workers communist party following 
the election of soldarity member tadeusz mazowiecki as polish prime 
minister 
the newspaper cautioned that discounting the communists would be 
premature pravda cautioned it said the communists by right are the 
most important group in polish politics 
mazowieckis election thursday with support from many communist 
lawmakers gave the east bloc is first noncommunist leader since 
world war ii 
the soviet government sent an immediate telegram of 
congratulations to mazowiecki but pravdas commentary the most 
authoritative to date cast doubt on whether mazowiecki can succeed 
in breaking polands economic decline 
is this the way out of the labyrinth the newspaper asked it 
never really answered the question

soviet and us scientists politicians and 
entertainers on saturday urged their governments to forge an 
environmental security alliance to combat global warming 
actorfilmmaker robert redford who cosponsored the fourday 
conference with the soviet academy of science read a letter to 
president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the united states of america and the ussr are the two 
largest producers of greenhouse gases thought to cause global 
warming redford said 
we should provide the leadership in the search for common 
solutions to the global warming problem as well as for the 
environmental security of the world 
the letter was signed by redford and space researcher roald 
segdeev head of an 11member soviet delegation who said the two 
nations must cooperate to undo the environmental damage they have 
incurred 
for the crimes weve committed as humans on the planet we are 
sentenced to do this job and i think it is a lifelong sentence 
segdeev said 
his comments ended the conference of soviet and american 
scientists political leaders environmentalists filmmakers and 
authors among those attending were sens bill bradley dnj and 
tim wirth dcolo idaho gov cecil andrus astronomer carl sagan 
former interior secretary stewart udall and cartoonist garry 
trudeau 
the attempt at greenhouse glasnost was not as much a 
scientific conference as it was an attempt to pass the baton 
from scientists to policyshapers in both countries who need to 
take action redford said 
during the conference scientists predicted that the greenhouse 
effect caused by rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and 
other gases produced by industrial societies could raise global 
temperatures by 2 to 10 degrees over the next century that could 
alter worldwide weather patterns and cause the melting of the polar 
ice caps flooding coastal regions 
to combat the rise of carbon dioxide much of which comes from 
the burning of fossil fuels the letter proposes the two superpowers 
form an environmental security alliance to 
promote energyefficient technology 
halt production and use by the year 2000 of chlorofluorocarbons 
another group of greenhouse gases and substantially reduce 
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 
reduce the rate of worldwide deforestation and start the 
planting of trees in unforested areas 
the letter was accompanied by a conference report detailing 
specific strategies for reducing global warming 
in the past redfords institute for resource management a 
private environmental mediation group based at his sundance resort 
in central utah has tackled offshore drilling in the bering sea 
the construction of power plants in the southwest and air quality 
issues

the b2 stealth bomber ended 
the longest and most secretive of its three test flights over the 
mojave desert on saturday with a safe landing here an air force 
spokeswoman said 
the batlike bomber took off at 830 am from edwards air force 
base and landed at 106 pm four hours and 36 minutes later said 
capt tess taft 
brig gen richard m scofield program director for b2 system 
program office called the bombers third flight a success we are 
extremely pleased with todays mission scofield said in a 
statement 
the b2s flight saturday was by far the longest highest and 
fastest thus far said taft 
the aircraft flew at 25000 feet and at speeds of up to 300 
knots or about 345 miles per hour she said in the previous two 
flights the bomber never exceeded a height of 10000 feet a speed 
of 180 knots or two hours in the air 
the primary mission was to check out the systems and see how it 
flies she said thats what test flights are for to go a 
little bit higher fly a little bit faster 
as in the earlier test flights the bomber was piloted by air 
force col richard s couch and northrop chief test pilot bruce 
hinds said taft 
she did not have any other details about the flight from the 
desert air base 55 miles northeast of los angeles 
the second test flight of the radarevading b2 on aug 16 was 
cut short in midflight because of a hairline crack in the casing of 
an accessory drive the part powers the 530 million jets 
generators and controls and caused oil pressure to drop taft said 
friday 
the bombers twohour maiden flight earlier this summer was 
termed a success 
unlike the previous two test flights the saturday flight was not 
announced in advance by the air force 
the government has spent about 224 billion in the b2 program 
which is 18 months behind schedule congress has balked at the 
thought of paying more than 500 million apiece for 132 bombers 
shrouded in secrecy for 10 years northrop and the pentagon last 
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes 
the pentagon wants 47 billion for the bomber in the coming 
fiscal year and it may need 8 billion in each of the three years 
of peak production from 1992 to 1994 
engineers say that the use of composite materials combined with 
the bombers shape and smooth leading edges give it a tiny radar 
signature making it nearly impossible for current soviet systems to 
detect

floridas second statewide crack crackdown this 
summer captured more than 2100 suspects from teenagers to an 
82yearold man and more than doubled the number of crack rocks 
confiscated authorities said saturday 
the greater quantity of crack seized in operation rock pile 
ii indicates police arrested more dealers than in the first 
roundup broward county sheriffs spokesman george crolius said 
an estimated 1200 officers in all of the states 67 counties 
arrested 2117 suspects during the 48 hours ending midnight friday 
compared with 2076 arrests in the twoday operation begun june 30 
the second roundup produced 9507 crack cocaine rocks 
individual chunks of crack ready for smoking as well as 273 
pounds of cocaine powder 1272 pounds of marijuana 75 firearms 
327 vehicles and more than 70000 in cash crolius said by 
telephone from the operation command post in fort lauderdale 
the first operation rock pile netted 3510 crack cocaine 
rocks 10 pounds of cocaine powder 3 pounds of marijuana 50 
firearms 327 vehicles and 55000 cash 
the operations main objective was to get as much crack off the 
street as we can said another sheriffs spokesman jim leljedal 
in pompano beach frank wilcher 82 was among those arrested 
crolius said 
wilcher who had a substantial amount of crack rocks cash and 
several firearms in his house was charged with trafficking in 
cocaine and could face a life sentence if convicted crolius said 
its an enticement to all members of our society the lure of 
easy money from the sale of crack rocks said crolius 
the crackdown coordinated by the florida sheriffs association 
combined reverse sting and trojan horse operations with search 
warrants and highway surveillance 
undercover officers in reverse stings pose as drug sellers and 
arrest customers in trojan horse operations deputies hidden in 
the back of a van jump out and arrest street corner dealers when

roman catholic primate jozef glemp on 
saturday urged jews worldwide to stop being antipolish in his first 
comment on the controversy surrounding a convent at auschwitz death 
camp 
let us start a dialogue in honesty and in truth said 
cardinal glemp leader of polands catholic church if there would 
be no antipolonism there will be no antisemitism in our 
country 
he spoke to thousands of pilgrims at jasna gora monastery in the 
southern city of czestochowa on the holiday honoring the black 
madonna polands most revered catholic icon 
glemp was responding to international criticism of the churchs 
aug 10 abrogation of a 1987 promise to move the convent from the 
perimeter of the former nazi camp 
many jewish groups consider the convent an intrusion at the site 
where more than 25 million jews were killed by the nazis three 
million of the 35 million jews in poland at world war ii were 
killed in the holocaust 
most survivors fled immediately after and in another wave after a 
governmentled antisemitic purge in 1968 leaving the jewish 
population here today at only several thousand 
glemp in coments reported by the pap state news agency said 
have there been animosities and adventures against jews in 
poland yes there have have there been jews in poland 
businessmen who neglected and detested poles yes were there 
jewish collaborators during the nazi occupation who did not grow 
into the heroic defenders of the warsaw ghetto yes 
he also noted jews were among polish soldiers killed at the siege 
of monte cassino in italy and at katyn in the soviet union 
the brotherhood of common martyrdom has extraordinary 
significance so why has the problem of auschwitz and the convent 
of the carmelite nuns been born why has it exploded so suddenly 40 
years after putting out the crematoria he asked 
dialogue is needed the systematic explanation of difficult 
things not of putting forth demands glemp said 
the carmelite nuns living beside the camp site in oswiecim 
wanted and want to be a symbol of the human solidarity which covers 
the living and the dead 
cant you see dear jews that acting against them offends the 
feelings of all poles and our sovereignty 
your power is the mass media at easy disposal in many 
countries dont let them serve to kindle antipolonism 
referring to seven american jews who climbed a fence at the 
convent july 14 and occupied the convent yard before being roughly 
dragged out by workmen glemp said dont call the jewish 
assailants heroes 
he also urged jews to distinguish between the auschwitz camp 
where he said mainly poles were killed and the nearby birkenau 
camp run from a nazi headquarters at auschwitz where mainly jews 
died

the state department citing colombias massive 
crackdown on drug traffickers issued a travel warning saturday 
night and asked americans to postpone trips to that south american 
nation 
due to recent events colombias security situation is 
unsettled and likely to remain so in the near future a statement 
read by state department spokesman adam shub said the government 
of colombias aggressive actions against narcotics traffickers could 
raise the level of violence in some areas and american citizens 
even though not specifically targeted could find themselves caught 
up in random violence 
an unprecedented crackdown is underway in colombia following the 
recent murder of a highly popular presidential candidate luis 
carlos galan the colombians have confiscated millions of dollars in 
goods and made mass arrests 
the department of state recommends that nonessential travel to 
colombia be postponed for at least several weeks pending 
clarification of the security situation those who deem their travel 
essential should contact the us embassy in bogota or the us 
consulate in barranquilla immediately upon arrival the statement 
said 
shub said the travel warning was issued following a decision by 
the us embassy in colombia to limit travel to the country he said 
it was a precautionary measure aimed at reducing the demands 
on the embassy security staff 
there is no evidence of a specific threat against either 
official or private americans but given the heightened level of 
confrontation between the colombian authorities and drug 
traffickers we believe it is prudent for us citizens to avoid 
nonessential travel shub said

voyager 2 discovered at least six tiny 
moonlets hidden in one of neptunes two brightest rings and 
also found three more rings orbiting the planet nasa said saturday 
voyagers scientists also reported the solar systems 
fourthlargest planet is surrounded by a radiation belt and has a 
tilted magnetic field and may have an aurora like earths northern 
and southern lights 
the researchers said nitrogen the gas that makes up 78 percent 
of earths atmosphere is the main component in the skies of 
triton the frosty neptunian moon sculpted with faults cliffs pink 
snow meteorite craters and inactive volcanoes that once oozed 
viscous ice instead of molten rock methane or natural gas is 
present as well they said 
by 9 am pdt sunday voyager will be 229 million miles from 
neptune speeding away from the planet at 37689 mph the probe will 
be 275 billion miles from earth voyager traveled a curving 
443billionmile path to achieve thursday nights close encounter 
with neptune and friday mornings flight past triton 
we have five rings at neptune including the two bright ones 
found earlier by the spacecraft and three new ones said bradford 
smith leader of the voyager photographic imaging team at the space 
agencys jet propulsion laboratory 
smith said later the boundaries between the five rings arent 
well defined so there could be as few as three rings or as many as 
five he reversed himself later saturday deciding the rings are 
distinct enough to count the total as five 
a bright ring discovered aug 11 initially appeared to be a 
partial ring called a ring arc but proved to be a complete ring 
six to eight icy objects the largest no bigger than 6 miles to 12 
miles wide are embedded in that ring smith said 
you could refer to them as moonlets he said 
smith said the gravity of the moonlets may explain why the ring 
has a clumpy appearance with some segments wider than others 
so far voyager has discovered six objects orbiting neptune that 
are large enough to be called moons that brings the total to eight 
moons including triton and nereid which were discovered from earth 
the ring containing the moonlets remains neptunes outermost 
ring next toward the planet is a narrow newly discovered ring 
followed by another previously unknown ring that is a broad diffuse 
band of dust then comes the other ring discovered earlier closest 
to neptune is the third newly discovered ring a broad diffuse band 
of dust nasa said was 1550 miles wide 
the initial confusion over the number of neptunes rings is 
reminiscent of what happened at uranus in 1986 ten thin rings were 
apparent as voyager neared uranus but after the spacecraft passed 
that planet a wide sheet of rings and dust bands became visible 
when backlit by the sun as a result scientists still are arguing 
how many distinct rings orbit uranus 
researchers said saturday that voyager also found 
neptunes magnetic poles are tilted at least 30 degrees away 
from the poles around which the planet rotates earths magnetic 
axis is angled 12 degrees away from its rotational axis putting one 
magnetic pole in northern canada about 1000 miles from the true or 
rotational north pole 
the planet is surrounded by a radiation belt much weaker than 
the van allen belts encircling earth the radiation belts location 
near the orbit of triton may explain the pinkish hue of some of the 
moons surface radiation bombardment can turn frozen natural gas 
that color 
deputy voyager project scientist ellis miner said there is 
evidence from an ultraviolet light sensor that at 30 degrees south 
latitude neptune has an aurora similar to earths northern and 
southern lights other scientists saturday refused to discuss the 
evidence saying it was too preliminary 
if the aurora proves real neptunes tilted magnetic field would 
explain why the glowing lights are relatively close to the planets 
equator rather than the rotational poles 
auroras are caused when electrically charged particles in solar 
wind spiral in toward a planet along magnetic field lines on earth 
they surround the polar regions because the magnetic and rotational 
poles are relatively close 
voyager continued saturday to send back recorded photographs 
taken during its neptunetriton flyby including its most detailed 
photos of triton 
the spaceship also looked over its shoulder to make a global 
temperature map of neptune search for auroras and more rings and 
study the weight of neptune and triton 
voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored jupiter in 1979 
saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 until oct 2 voyager 2 will look 
back at neptune then it will head toward interstellar space 
looking for the edge of the solar system

voyager 2s neptune encounter marks the 
last planetary flyby by a us spacecraft but missions to venus 
jupiter and mars mean america will keep exploring space a nasa 
official said saturday 
we are embarking on the second golden age of space science 
said lennard fisk the agencys associate administrator for space 
science and applications whats coming up is an era of 
unprecedented excitement and activity 
the national aeronautics and space administration plans to launch 
35 space science flights in the next five years the highest launch 
rate ever and us spacecraft will be exploring planets 
continuously from next year until 2006 fisk said during a visit to 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory 
fisk was at the lab to watch voyager 2s brush with neptune last 
thursday night the probes final encounter after it explored 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
in many ways this is the end of an era the last time we will 
see a planet for a first time the end of the reconnaissance phase 
of planetary explorations he said there are no plans to explore 
pluto the only planet still not visited by a spacecraft 
but fisk listed several missions that will orbit planets rather 
than fly past them 
magellan launched from a space shuttle last may arrives at 
venus next august and will study that planet for several years 
galileo will be launched from the shuttle atlantis on oct 12 
arriving in orbit around jupiter in 1996 and studying the planet 
until the end of the century 
the hubble space telescope is due for launch from a shuttle next 
march and is so powerful that from its orbit around earth it will 
be able to observe the universe back to the beginning of time 
fisk said 
mars observer will be launched in 1992 reaching the red planet 
in 1993 and studying it until 1996 
nasa has asked congress to approve the comet rendevousasteroid 
flyby and cassini missions fisk said craf would fly past an 
asteroid then orbit a comet from 2000 through 2002 fisk said the 
similar spacecraft on the cassini mission would drop a probe onto 
saturns moon titan then orbit saturn from 2002 through 2006 
fisk disputed assertions that unmanned space exploration will 
suffer financially because of the shuttle program saying that 70 
percent to 80 percent of nonmilitary shuttle flights will be 
dedicated to space science 
fisk said space science studies suffered in recent years not from 
a lack of funds but because of delays in developing the shuttle and 
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger and halted 
launches until last fall

the 14party opposition coalition on 
saturday announced a platform for february elections focusing on 
nicaraguas economic crisis but offering no details of a promised 
austerity budget 
the national opposition union also promised legal title to 
peasants given land under sandinista agrarian reforms and 
compensation for those whose land was confiscated 
it pledges several improved social programs but does not mention 
the tough measures any nicaraguan government would need to take to 
halt inflation and increase production 
a coalition government of national salvation would institute 
an austerity budget the platform says without detailing specifics 
president daniel ortegas sandinista government already is taking 
some measures in january it fired 30000 public employees cut its 
budget by more than 40 percent and slashed investments to combat 
inflation that topped 33000 percent last year 
but the sandinistas have failed to create a climate of confidence 
in the private sector to encourage production confiscating land as 
punishment for political opposition is among sandinista measures 
that have antagonized private business and lowered production 
that is one area marked for change by the coalition which spans 
a broad spectrum of ideologies range from communist to conservative 
its platform envisions less state control of the domestic and 
export markets more foreign investment and a freeing of the economy 
it also mentions in several places its intent to separate the 
armed forces from politics and reduce the size of the 200000strong 
army the largest in central america 
the coalition said it will announce its candidates for president 
and vice president next week coalition members still must decide 
the procedure for choosing the candidates 
likeliest choices for their presidential candidate are violeta 
barrios de chamorro whose family owns the opposition newspaper la 
prensa businessman enrique bolanos geyer and independent liberal 
party leader virgilio godoy

a new expedition spurred by the 
theory of two retired military fliers is planned next month to try 
to solve the mystery of amelia earharts disappearance 
the pioneering aviatrix and her navigator fred noonan vanished 
52 years ago in the south pacific on a 2556mile leg of their 
attempted flight around the world 
the pensacola news journal reported saturday that two men from 
this florida panhandle city tom willi 62 a former navy pilot and 
tom gannon 69 who had been an air force navigator have persuaded 
the international group for historic aircraft recovery or tighar 
that they had the navigation clues to solve the mystery 
the organization plans to send a 20member expedition that will 
include willi and gannon to the fiji islands on sept 4 said 
richard gillespie executive director and search team leader for the 
group based in wilmington del 
there have been numerous theories to explain ms earharts 
disappearance including speculation that she was captured by the 
japanese and executed as a spy willi and gannon believe she may 
have come down on nikumaroro island then known as gardner island 
about 1000 miles south of fiji they base their theory on a study 
of her flight plan and other information 
they contend winds may have blown the plane southeast of its 
destination howland ilsand toward nikumaroro with only two hours 
of fuel left ms earhart and noonan decided to fly south toward 
nikumaroro because they knew there were no other islands to the 
north of their flight path within range of their remaining fuel 
willi and gannon contend 
were just amazed that nobody ever figured this out before 
gannon said the whole thing was a navigation problem i guess it 
took two navigators to hopefully solve it 
although it had been widely thought the navy searched the island 
willi and gannon said they found out that float planes from the 
battleship uss colorado flew over but no search party ever landed 
there 
they say have other clues including the reported 1938 discovery 
on the island of a female skeleton wearing american shoes ms 
earhart and noonan disappeared on july 2 1937 
in the four days after they vanished radio operators at 
different locations picked up 24 transmissions made in a female 
voice and on ms earharts frequency when plotted the 
transmissions cross at nikumaroro willi and gannon say 
we have always stayed away from the amelia earhart thing 
gillespie said were a nonprofit aviation archaeological 
foundation and there are so many theories about amelia earhart that 
arent credible 
gillespie said however that he changed his mind after spending 
a day with willi and gannon as they unraveled clues based mainly on 
celestial navigation techniques that he described as a lost art 
those techniques he said are what ms earhart and noonan relied 
upon in the days before electronic navigation systems 
the expedition is expected to last through the first week of 
october and cost up to 250000

small claims court that he lost wages because of the nations 
largest oil spill

writing 7700 in checks to daniels he dropped his demand for a 
letter of apology from don cornett the head of exxon in alaska

fishermen unable to fish and left him without people for whom to 
hang nets his earnings would have allowed him to rent a boat for a 
fishing venture that would have generated 100000 he said

takeitorleaveit offer of only 500 an exxon attorney said the 
company had trouble getting paperwork from daniels

a federal jury on saturday night 
declared independence militant filiberto ojeda rios innocent of all 
charges filed against him for shooting at fbi agents during his 1985 
arrest 
this has been a historic verdict a message of powerful content 
to the united states government ojeda rios told hundreds of 
wellwishers outside the federal building i was tried by their 
court but by puerto ricans and they lost 
but us district judge carmen consuelo vargas de cerezo said she 
could not free ojeda rios since he still is wanted in hartford 
conn for his alleged part in a 7 million wells fargo robbery 
there in 1983 
defense attorney luis camacho said ojeda rios probably will be 
transferred to roosevelt roads naval station in eastern puerto rico 
and eventually be flown to hartford 
the 12member jury issued the verdict after more than four hours 
deliberation 
ojeda rios selfproclaimed leader of the proindependence 
macheteros underground group had faced charges for shooting at 
federal agents during his 1985 arrest at his home in luquillo 
puerto rico fbi agent abelardo alba was slightly injured when 
struck by a bullet fragment in the eye 
the fiveweek trial in which ojeda rios defended himself ended 
thursday 
the jury dropped all eight charges including assault illegal 
arms possession and preventing federal agents from carrying out an 
arrest 
ojeda rios claimed he acted in selfdefense when he opened fire 
with his uzi submachine gun alleging the fbi agents who raided his 
home shooting their weapons intended to kill him 
i could reach no other conclusion ojeda rios told the jury 
they tried to assassinate me 
he said he had been under fbi surveillance for weeks and could 
have been arrested at any time making the raid unnecessary 
ojeda rios acknowledged he burned documents moments before the 
federal agents burst into his apartment but said it was to protect 
the identity of other puerto rican independence militants 
us district attorney daniel lopez romo told the jury that those 
activists were not innocent believers in the noble ideal of 
independence he said ojeda rios burned the documents to protect 
puerto ricans involved in illegal activities 
during the trial fbi witnesses claimed they warned ojeda rios to 
surrender before deciding to raid the apartment 
the fbi arrested ojeda rios and several other macheteros members 
in an islandwide sweep on aug 30 1985 
sixteen puerto ricans allegedly took part in the wells fargo 
robbery including seven who were sentenced earlier this year the 
state department claims the main suspect in the robbery wells fargo 
security guard victor gerena escaped to cuba with part of the loot 
ojeda rios is expected to stand trial on the robbery charges at a 
later date 
the trial came in the midst of heated debate of the islands 
relationship with the united states which took control of puerto 
rico after the 1898 spanishamerican war 
draft legislation for a 1991 plebiscite on the islands future 
recently has been prepared the options are statehood independence 
or continued commonwealth status with more autonomy for its 32 
million people in a 1967 plebiscite the spanishspeaking caribbean 
island chose commonwealth status

a texas congressman asked the treasury 
department friday to investigate a customs service ruling he says 
would allow us companies to import south african steel for 
construction of a bridge across the houston ship channel 
bryant a democrat said the decision by customs commercial 
rulings division appears to go against the antiapartheid act of 
1986 which prohibits the importation of south african steel and 
iron into the united states 
according to bryant the ruling would allow two contractors hired 
by the texas highway department williams brothers of houton and 
traylor brothers of indiana to import nearly 31 million pounds of 
steel from a south african company for the bridge project 
customs spokeswoman judy turner in houston said the agency was 
not prepared to comment late friday on bryants inquiries she said 
she could not confirm the substance of the ruling and officials at 
the division were not available for comment late friday 
the 91 million bridge would be the costliest state funded road 
work in texas history 
according to bryant the ruling was issued july 14 
considering the fact that president bush the congress and 
many other public officials both statewide and nationally have have 
gone on record opposing the inhumane system of apartheid and the 
purchase of materials derived from the exploitive use of cheap 
leabor i cannot even begin to comprehend this decision said 
bryant 
bryant has also asked robert h dedman chairman of the texas 
highways and public transportation commission for an explanation 
i am at a loss to understand why the highway commission would 
apparently not only pass over the american steel industry and its 
workers but also indirectly support south africas apartheid 
government bryant wrote dedman 
bryant has asked treasury secretary nicholas brady to determine 
whether the commercial rulings division has the jurisdiction to make 
such a ruling and on what basis it made its decision he also wants 
to known when the contract was signed the name of the south african 
company and whether the ruling violates the antiapartheid act of 
1986 or any other laws on trade with south africa 
the antiapartheid act of 1986 is aimed at curtailing us trade 
with south africa because of that countrys system of racial 
separation

the commodity futures trading commission said 
friday that it found no examples of selfdealing by officials of the 
chicago board of trade during last months forced liquidation of 
soybean futures contracts 
but the chairman of the senate agriculture committee said a 
preliminary report by the commission raised possible 
conflictofinterest questions about several of the officials who 
voted to require traders to reduce their holdings of contracts 
calling for future delivery of soybeans to them long positions 
the cftc must question those chicago board of trade directors 
participating in the july soybean decision whose affiliated firms 
held net short positions in the july soybean contract in house or 
customer accounts said sen patrick leahy dvt in a statement 
issued by his office 
credibility is paramount for exchanges in carrying out their 
selfregulatory functions the public will not tolerate selfdealing 
or conflict of interest by exchange directors or insiders the 
leahy statement said 
holders of short positions promises to deliver beans they do 
not own would benefit from an order like the one issued by the 
board of trade on july 11 
one who holds a short position can can buy and deliver beans or 
he can buy an offsetting long position generally such a trader 
is betting on a fall in price and the ability to buy an offsetting 
contract at a price lower than he paid for his original contract 
thus making a profit 
if the longs are forced to sell the price of the contract 
declines and the shorts can fulfill their obligations cheaper 
than they would otherwise 
the order forcing longs to sell touched off wild swings in 
soybean prices and sparked sharp criticism by farm groups and 
traders who saw the value of their holdings drop 
the board of trade has said it acted after consulting the 
commission because italian grain merchant ferruzzi finanziaria 
spa failed to reduce its large holdings in the july soybean 
market voluntarily 
officials of the exchange have said they were worried that there 
were not enough beans to fulfill all delivery commitments in the 
final days of the contract 
the order required traders to reduce their long positions to 1 
million bushels and was widely perceived as a move to prevent 
ferruzzi from cornering the market that is forcing other traders 
into a position of having to deliver beans to ferruzzi where 
ferruzzi was the only source of beans 
such a situation if ferruzzi could maintain it would all but 
enable ferruzzi to name its own price to let the other traders off 
the hook stock and commodity exchanges have rules aimed at banning 
corners 
ferruzzi has denied any wrongdoing or intention to corner the 
market and has bitterly critized the boards action 
we continue to believe that is was totally unnecessary for the 
board to take its emergency action said david swanson an 
executive with ferruzzi group a us subsidiary 
the ferruzzi group supports sen leahys call for further 
investigartion by the cftc into the matter 
michael oakes a spokesman for the exchange said that even 
though directors may have represented firms whose customers held 
short july soybean positions theyre not involved in the 
decisionmaking of their customers 
the commission said it found no director who appeared to trade 
for the purpose of profiting personally or through an affiliated 
firm from prior knowledge of the july 11 order 
one director excused himself before deliberations began because 
he held a spread position both long and short in july soybeans 
his affiliated firm also had net short positions for itself and 
customers 
the commissions preliminary report was contained in a 36page 
letter to leahy from chairwoman wendy l gramm it said 
investigators intend to conduct more interviews

highlight of french celebrations commemorating the bicentennial of 
the declaration of the rights of man 
people hear the word funambulist and they think of the circus 
but thats not at all what i do he said gazing at the wire 
strung fine as a spiders web 
i want people to be enlightened by a vision i want to uplift 
their minds and hearts 
petit who shares with dancers a passion for poetic gestures and 
movements that transfigure is asked with deadly monotony about the 
danger involved in his work the question bores him 
i take no risks ive been preparing for this for 10 years and 
the technical aspects for six months said petit who did all his 
own rigging and studied blueprints photos and charts 
his walk was authorized by paris mayor jacques chirac who will be 
waiting on the towers second level 330 feet above the ground 
petit will carry a rolled copy of the declaration of the rights of 
man on his 40pound balancing bar to lay in chiracs hands 
the document distilling ideals of liberty and social justice 
that emerged in 1789 from the french revolution doesnt interest 
petit he wants to present his own vision 
when you see someone who does something seemingly impossible 
it must be that anything is possible i want to tell people your 
dreams can come true not by luck but by shovel and ax

the united states and taiwan have signed an 
agreement that will enable federal authorities to track taiwanese 
fishing vessels by satellite in an effort to reduce illegal salmon 
fishing in the north pacific 
the agreement signed thursday calls for radio transponders to 
be installed in taiwanese boats allowing satellite surveillance of 
taiwans pacific fishing fleet it also permits us officials to 
board those ships 
in addition the pact provides for observers to monitor the 
driftnet fishermens impact on dolphin porpoise seal and other 
marine mammal populations 
tough negotiating pays off said us sen frank murkowski 
ralaska i believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone 
for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most 
vital resource 
the united states has accused taiwan fishermen of using driftnets 
to deplete the north pacific of its rich marine resources 
especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the united 
states 
conservationists have criticized the driftnets some of which are 
40 miles long for their incidental catches of thousands of sea 
birds seals and other animals 
some northwest fishermen said they liked what they heard friday 
about the pact 
its another step forward said barry collier of the pacific 
seafood processors association 
but at least one environmental group warned the agreement doesnt 
go far enough and that no such pact has been signed with south korea 
as a congressionally mandated deadline approaches 
you just cant trust these driftnetters said alan reichman 
pacific ocean ecology coordinator for greenpeace 
collier whose pacific seafood processors represents 85 percent 
of the processors in alaska washington and oregon estimated 7 
million salmon were taken illegally during 1987 
the agreement was signed for the united states by david laux 
chairman of the american institute in taiwan and ding moushih 
taiwans representative in washington dc diplomatic letters to 
finalize the agreement were signed friday 
the institute serves as the unofficial us embassy in taiwan 
the us government severed diplomatic ties with taiwan in 1978 
the key here is this monitoring equipment will go a long way to 
determining where those fish are caught and give us more confidence 
in managing the resource said vince curry of the alaska factory 
trawlers association 
by signing the pact taiwan beat a monday deadline set by a 1987 
law that threatened sanctions if japan south korea and taiwan did 
not agree to monitor their pacific fishing fleets and enforce bans 
on taking highseas salmon 
japan signed an agreement in june that called for the 
experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers nine 
american five canadian and 33 japanese to monitor driftnet damage 
to marine mammal populations 
similar details were not available friday for the pact with 
taiwan 
the us state department said friday that talks with the south 
koreans had been suspended until aug 29 similar agreements to 
those accepted by the japanese and taiwanese have been proposed 
yu yuhsien chairman of taiwans council of agriculture said in 
taipei that his government agreed to the pact for the sake of 
600000 fishermen on the island who depend on exports to the united 
states mostly of tuna and shrimp

some bond market investors had been pinning hopes 
on lower interest rates but recent indications that the economy is 
maintaining strength have dashed speculation that the federal 
reserve board will ease rates soon 
with that prospect now unlikely bond prices have fallen in 
recent weeks the price drop has brought a return of an inverted 
yield curve or the situation where shortterm bonds yield more than 
longerterm ones 
an inverted yield curve defies the logic that longterm investors 
should be compensated more than shortterm ones because of the 
higher risk in holding debt for a longer period of time 
a further weakening of bond prices has been caused by the 
treasury which has flooded the government bond market with new debt 
issues this month 
signs that a recession was not imminent prompted a bond selloff 
earlier this month putting even more downward pressure on prices 
bonds are considered a good investment when the economy is slumping 
because their rate of return is constant 
but to confuse matters bond prices rallied briefly this past 
week when bond prices rise yields fall market watchers attributed 
the price rise to an auction of fiveyear treasury issues wednesday 
that drew greaterthanexpected demand 
however trading was thin wednesday leading some to speculate 
that the rally reflected buying interest among a small group of 
investors 
marketwatchers looking to the feds federal open market 
committee for lower interest rates may be disappointed 
the fomc which sets interestrate policy held its 
eighttimesayear meeting last week but as is its practice gave 
no hint of any decision on its strategy 
most experts expect the fed to stay on its current course of 
moderating economic growth by holding interest rates steady the 
bush administration has been pressing for lower rates to stimulate 
economic growth but the fed appears more concerned with 
forestalling any resurgence in inflation 
a few weeks ago everyone assumed that the economy was slowing 
precipitously said william veronda senior vice president for 
fixedincome securities at the denver investment firm financial 
programs inc 
unfortunately for that thesis it now appears that the economy 
was either one never as bad as it appeared to be or two theres 
been some slight reacceleration he said 
the current bond slump curtailed a rally that sent treasury 
prices to twoyear highs the yield on the bellwether 30year 
treasury bond fell from about 930 percent in late march to 784 
percent on aug 1 since then it has risen somewhat and was 
trading in the range of 8 percent to 825 percent last week 
some market experts say that current economic conditions mean 
neither gloom nor doom for bond investors 
while recession may not be imminent a rebound in economic 
activity that could revitalize inflation appears remote moodys 
investors service inc said in a commentary last week most of the 
markets recent setback reflects how too many investors had expected 
too quick an easing of monetary policy 
some marketwatchers advise bond investors to put their money in 
the middle range of debt maturities such as fiveyear treasury 
notes striking a balance between the attraction of high yields on 
shortterm instruments and the possibility of capital gains on 
longterm bonds 
smith barney harris upham amp co has advised customers to reduce 
their longterm bond holdings as a percentage of their total 
investments due to the belief that the fed will not ease interest 
rates soon 
smith barney and other investment houses believe that longterm 
treasuries will hold in the range of 8 percent to 850 percent in 
coming months but says smith barney it now seems more likely that 
these bonds would yield more than this range rather than less in the 
near term 
we continue to see the potential for still lower yields over 
the intermediate to longer term on the assumption that the federal 
reserve continues a policy of on balance restraint as long as the 
economy is operating near full resource utilization the 
investment house said in a commentary

sugar futures prices fluctuated widely on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange as traders bought into the market on news of 
a large purchase by india and bailed out on reports the european 
sugar beet crop may exceed last years 
adding to sugar price instabilty is what analysts say is the 
inability of the october futures contract to sustain advances at a 
price higher than 14 cents a pound 
bernard savaiko an analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
said traders view the sugar market as bullish but are afraid to buy 
contracts 
he said there wont be a significant change in trader attitudes 
until third world countries are willing to pay high prices created 
by the delicate balance of supply and demand 
world sugar stocks are low due to several years of poor 
sugarcane crops and steadily rising consumption 
savaiko said a factor keeping third world countries out of the 
sugar market is that sugar is often bought and sold for dollars 
making it expensive in terms of those countrys currencies 
a third world leader india entered the market for 200000 tons 
of refined sugar but it had been expected that india would purchase 
as much as 500000 tons of raw and refined sugar so the smaller 
figure was a disappointment 
sugar prices fell sharply on projections by fo licht the west 
german sugar statistical firm that european sugar production will 
increase from the 301 million tons produced last year to 323 
million tons 
licht also said weather in the soviet union had been excellent 
resulting in an improved crop of sugar in that country reducing its 
import needs

malcolm forbes might measure up to george m 
cohan as a showman but the multimillionaire motorcyclist doesnt 
hold a candle to the vaudevillian hoofer when it comes to outdancing 
the internal revenue service 
forbes dropped some vague hints that he might seek a tax 
deduction for his bellydancing party of the century last 
weekend in morocco where such swells as henry kissinger and 
elizabeth taylor ate pigeon under tents 
after a small public outcry forbes called a news conference to 
say he would not be taking a deduction for his 70th birthday party 
and in fact had never considered doing so 
clearly business entertainment is not what it was 59 years ago 
when the late george m cohan scored a victory over the irs so 
sweeping that tax lawyers still talk about the cohan rule 
cohan the original yankee doodle boy claimed 55000 in 
deductions for entertaining his actors employees drama critics and 
lawyer in the early 1920s the irs disallowed the deductions because 
he hadnt kept records 
in 1930 a federal appeals court ruled that since cohan obviously 
had some legitimate expenses the irs appeals board should find a 
way to grant him some deductions in spite of the lack of records 
the cohan rule hamstrung the irs over the following decades and 
people who knew how to milk the system probably got more than they 
should have said nancy anderson senior tax research and training 
specialist for hampr block inc in kansas city mo 
in the 1980s congress has tightened the tax laws on business 
entertainment considerably not only toughening recordkeeping 
standards to eliminate the cohan rule but cutting the deduction rate 
to 80 percent and gradually limiting or disallowing deductions that 
once were routine golf club dues nights out at cheesy discos sky 
boxes at the superdome 
malcolm forbes argued this past week that he could have qualified 
for some deductions if he had wanted to since many of his guests 
were advertisers in his magazine but several tax experts said the 
magazine publisher was living in the past 
i dont know where forbes was coming from said mario borino 
national tax director for the accounting firm of bdo seidman even 
under the old law before tax reform i would have serious questions 
as to whether the cost of any part of that birthday was deductible 
it used to be kind of fair game you go to a sporting event or 
you go out to a nightclubtype restaurant and have a great time and 
just because you happen to do business with the people you deduct 
it that just doesnt fly anymore said hampr blocks ms anderson 
forbes is not the only victim of changing times a philadelphia 
rabbi arnold h feldman was turned down by the tax court in 1986 
when he tried to deduct the 4000 cost of his sons bar mitzvah 
reception for 725 people 
under section 274 of the tax code the taxpayer must establish 
that the item was directly related to or associated with the 
active conduct of the taxpayers trade or business 
for forbes discussing hotair balloons with lee iacocca thus 
would not qualify moreover there is no deduction for amounts 
which are lavish or extravagant under the circumstances which 
would seem to disqualify a party featuring 600 belly dancers and a 
thundering horde of 200 berber marksmen on horseback 
its a very good example of what used to be and would be a 
real hard sell now ms anderson said 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 stocks set a record on 
thursday one day short of the second anniversary of its previous 
peak the 5653point surge to 273464 was hailed by some analysts 
as closing the book on the stock market crash of 1987 but on 
friday stocks retreated slightly and the dow average fell 228 
points 
holiday corp once known as americas innkeeper agreed to 
sell its holiday inn division to britains brewing giant bass plc 
which will pay 125 million in stock and assume about 21 billion 
of holiday debt the deal marked the end of an era for the nations 
first motel franchise founded 35 years ago by entrepreneur kemmons 
wilson 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo suggested he might sell a 
controlling stake in continental airlines partly because the 
carriers business has been hurt by a bitter strike at sister

as they study the forces behind the advance that 
carried the stock market to record highs in the past week some 
analysts look far beyond the latest swing in interest rates or the 
economic outlook for 1990 
the impressive gains in stock prices this year they say have 
merely extended a historic bull market that can be traced back to 
1982 when the dow jones industrial average stood as low as 77692 
or even 1974 when it bottomed at 57760 
as the charts of this long climb keep stretching out they make 
the crash of 1987 look less and less like the cataclysmic event it 
seemed at the time for all the pain it inflicted 
the first wouldbe historians of the great bull market see 
several largescale themes running through it 
a return to freemarket economic policies in the worlds 
industrialized countries after the increased reliance on government 
control and regulation that had taken place in the years since world 
war ii 
a sense of capitalism on the offensive and communism on the 
defensive around the world with economic power gaining importance 
over military might 
a largely successful campaign to subdue inflation in the united 
states after a scary surge in prices in the 1970s that had eroded 
confidence in financial rather than tangible assets 
the restructuring of american industry under pressure from 
foreign competition to make it fit once again to hold its own in 
global markets 
broad generalizations of this kind make many investors squirm 
any time people start believing grandiose claims about the supposed 
significance of what the market is doing veterans of the game start 
to suspect that stocks are ripe for a fall 
still ideas like this suggest that the stock market has been 
doing a lot more in the 1980s than just bouncing around wildly at 
the whims of computerprogram traders or the latest monthly economic 
statistic 
furthermore they represent the kind of longterm thinking that 
separates true investors from traders bucking the house odds to 
try to profit from a hot tip or takeover rumor 
at the close on friday dow joness average of 30 industrials 
stood at 273236 up 4439 from the week before 
among the broader indexes that had preceded the dow to new highs 
several weeks earlier the new york stock exchange composite index 
rose 215 to 19479 the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market gained 478 to 46675 and the american 
stock exchange market value index was up 200 at 38118 
volume on the big board averaged 16596 million shares a day up 
from 14884 million the week before 
the backtonature economics movement underlying the bull market 
hasnt always been a pretty or popular phenomenon 
it has been accompanied by financial scandals in both the united 
states and japan upheavals in the oncestable working environments 
of countless employers and a longrunning debate over whether the 
energy born of rampant selfinterest will take any society where it 
wants to go 
many observers worry that it has spawned excesses most notably 
in the use of borrowed money at every level of the economy that 
could sooner or later turn the markets heyday into a wistful memory 
but for now at least it has validated the faith of true 
believers in the longterm merits of stock ownership 1987 crash or 
not 
as norman fosback put the case in the investment advisory letter 
market logic those who forswear the stock market forever because 
of the crash overlook the real lesson of history a longterm 
stock investment program is the most reliable and easiest way to 
accumulate wealth that our society has to offer

though some firsttime investors who were scared 
away by the stock market crash two years ago never returned those 
who remained got their reward market watchers said 
the record high of 273464 in the dow jones industrials average 
thursday once again pointed out the value of a longterm investment 
strategy these observers said 
on friday the average slipped back 228 points to 273236 
anyone who held stocks for the past two years has about broken 
even while people who panicked and sold at the bottom took big 
losses 
a person has to live through a market break to fully appreciate 
what can happen in the next market peak said ken janke president 
of the national association of investors corp a nonprofit group 
of individual investors and investmentclub members 
media accounts of small investors abandoning the stock market 
after the crash were overblown says james cloonan president of the 
american association of individual investors 
the shrinkage in his members stock portfolios was mainly from a 
drop in the market price of shares not stock sales he said 
industry figures show that individual investors did leave the 
market after the crash but that many have since returned 
according to the securities industry association an average of 
37 million shares a day were traded by retail as opposed to 
institutional customers on the new york stock exchange in august 
1987 
that november after the crash the average number of daily 
retail trades dropped to 31 million the average for all of 1988 was 
29 million retail trades a day 
but the figure jumped to 39 million a day from january to june of 
this year the latest figures available 
the retail investor definitely is back said george monahan 
director of industry studies for the industry group 
nevertheless don scidmore a small investor in seattle said he 
believes the dow high could scare some investors away from the 
market rather than lure new ones 
the little investors you can to go any investment club now 
and theyre chewing their fingers and saying the dows up now and 
its due for a fall said scidmore who is retired and belongs to 
two investment clubs 
scidmore is not frightened away himself if youre in it for 
the long run so what he said it goes up and it goes down 
individual investors feel unable to compete with market 
professionals and institutions said david mclaughlin a portfolio 
manager with chase investment counsel corp an independent 
financial consultant in charlottesville va 
the individual investor feels that hes sort of outside looking 
in that the experts know whats going on they know where to look 
for takeover candidates mclaughlin said the individual feels 
that he doesnt get a fair shake 
mclaughlin believes the dow high will do little to lure more 
small investors back to the market he said the reaction of many is 
well i missed it and i should have been in on it but its too 
late now 
i think if we had a recession and we got into it for couple of 
quarters and of course the stock market would probably be lower 
then i think youd see the individual investor coming back he 
said 
on the flip side of that coin mclaughlin said that if the dow 
continues its upward climb and sets more records the trauma of the 
crash could fade into the back of many investors minds 
nancy dunnan an author of investment books agreed that many 
individual investors have returned to the market but she said 
87 wasnt that long ago so youre not going to see all of them 
jump back in 
she said small investors should have learned at least one lesson 
from the crash 
i think they should watch the market every single day and not 
let it ride and if they see a dip and theyve already made their 
profit to not be shy or greedy and take that profit she said

the japanese did it in six months france did it 
in 19 months and britain beat us by 20 days 
while the new record set by the dow jones average of 30 
industrials was celebrated as a symbolic comeback from the crash of 
1987 other stock markets around the world have made faster 
recoveries than wall street 
it wasnt that the us did poorly mark sladkus a vice 
president at morgan stanley amp co said friday its that the 
other markets had special circumstances 
a market measure compiled by morgan stanley and based on overall 
market performance shows that the us market reached a new high on 
july 26 lagging japan austria belgium denmark france the 
netherlands norway and sweden 
on the continent 1992 became a phenomenon that investors could 
sink their teeth into and europeans worked hard to sell 
investors on the concept of a single market of 320 million 
consumers said robert brusca chief economist at nikko securities 
co international inc 
it refocused attention on the tremendous opportunities that 
will be there in the private sector as trade barriers melt away 
and europe becomes an unencumbered free market brusca said 
in advance of 1992 the mergers and acquisition fever that has 
heated up the us market for so long spread its virus to the 
continent brusca said 
last year italian financier carlo debenedetti almost 
singlehandedly hoisted the belgian market out of the doldrums with 
his hostile and ultimately unsuccessful bid for societe 
generale a huge belgian conglomerate 
in addition to outright mergers european companies are fast 
forming crossborder alliances with likeminded firms all that is 
bringing in new technology new competitors and more strength and 
vitality to markets that had been a little more parochial brusca 
said 
in london the financial timesstock exchange 30share index hit 
a new high on aug 4 and has since surpassed that mark the broader 
100share index is just 46 points shy of its alltime high 
japan long the envy of other markets posted a new high in april 
1988 less than six months after black monday but experts note the 
japanese market did not fall as hard in the crash and therefore had 
less ground to regain than other markets 
additionally extremely low yields in the japanese bond market 
gave stocks a boost there are not a lot of competing domestic 
instruments so the stock market emerges as king brusca said 
this year however its performance has been hohum a scandal in 
the top ranks of government has taken its toll as has the weakening 
of the yen against the dollar japanese investors flush with cash 
are looking farther afield for places to stash their money 
hong kong which also performed well following the crash riding 
the wave of enthusiasm over chinas plans for economic expansion 
was slamdunked following the tiananmen square massacre said 
brusca the key hang seng index which hit a 1989 high of 33096 in 
midmay plunged to 20936 on june 5 it has yet to near its 
precrash high 
surprisingly some of the best postcrash opportunities can be 
found in emerging markets like mexico malaysia thailand argentina 
and others which allow foreigners to invest directly in securities 
so far this year morgan stanley has pegged their collective growth 
rate at about 33 percent 
over the long term those markets will outperform others 
because they represent more rapidly expanding economies morgan 
stanleys sladkus said they are clearly riskier but offer an option 
to investors bent on diversification 
thanks to the recent strength of the dollar the us markets 
remain attractive compared to their foreign counterparts 
theres clearly a pretty consistent flow into usdollar 
assets including stocks largely because confidence in our currency 
has been restored said charles i clough chief investment 
strategist at merrill lynch amp co a strong currency will just 
continually pull in foreign investments 
other economic factors add to the allure of american stocks and 
bonds theres a good feeling in terms of interest rates coming 
down corporate earnings going up and that weve been able to avoid 
a hard landing said sladkus

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo said he 
was considering a sale of continental airlines because the noise 
at striketorn eastern airlines was hurting the sister carriers 
business 
in an interview friday with the associated press lorenzo said 
the sale of part or all of houstonbased continental was under 
discussion partly because of the negative impact from easterns 
bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding 
we have to be responsible to our shareholders lorenzo said 
in his new york office we have an obligation to look for 
alternatives continental has been impacted by the noise level 
from all of our friends over in miami 
he made the surprise announcement about continental late thursday 
in response to a question at a company meeting 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection since march 9 five days after pilots machinists and 
flight attendants walked off the job eastern has been reorganizing 
as a smaller carrier and has hired nonunion workers 
the spillover from the eastern situation has eroded bookings on 
continental flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter 
said lorenzo whose texas air is the parent of the two carriers 
continental showed a net profit of 321 million in the quarter 
compared with a loss of 1509 million a year earlier 
continental could benefit from distance from eastern lorenzo 
said he cited the success of the trump shuttle which enjoyed a 
sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer donald trump 
bought it from eastern in early june for 365 million 
lorenzo stressed however a full or partial sale of continental 
are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision 
hasnt yet been made 
we have been approached by parties interested in a possible 
sale he said 
despite the strife at eastern and continentals reputation as a 
farecutting carrier with inferior service texas air stock has 
soared from around 9 or 10 a share at the beginning of the year to 
over 20 currently it rose 87 cents friday to close at 2075 on 
the american stock exchange after jumping as high as 2225 
possible buyers of continental or part of it could include 
scandinavian airlines system which has a 10 percent interest in 
texas air and pan am corp which has expressed a desire to merge 
with another airline under us law foreign airlines are allowed 
to buy up to 25 percent of american carriers there also has been 
speculation that carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc may be interested in a combination with continental 
lorenzo however appears to have rejected the idea of a merger 
with another airline according to a source close to the company who 
asked not to be named that would make more likely a buyout from an 
investor group possibly including sas or another foreign carrier 
sas spokeswoman barbara levites and pan am spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon both in new york declined comment on the matter friday an 
icahn associate didnt immediately return a call seeking comment 
continental would carry a sale price of about 2 billion if it 
were sold in its entirety and lorenzo may be trying to find out 
what the carrier could fetch some analysts suggested 
the worst may be over and it surprises me he lorenzo would be 
considering a major sale said daniel hersh an analyst with 
bateman eichler hill richards in los angeles 
lorenzo may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy 
sweeping the airline industry which could make struggling 
continental a hot property 
a group led by california investor alfred checchi recently 
acquired northwest airlines parent nwa inc for 4 billion while 
united airlines parent ual corp is being ardently pursued by 
investor marvin davis british airways plc and others

like kids tussling over an easter basket of 
goodies two federal agencies and the financial exchanges they 
regulate are squaring off over a new moneymaking product for 
investors known as a stock basket 
on one side are the stock exchanges and their overseer the 
securities and exchange commission created in the depths of the 
depression to regulate stocks and bonds and protect the people who 
invest in them 
on the other side is the newer commodity futures trading 
commission and its charges the boisterous markets that deal in 
commodities such as soybeans pork bellies and silver 
the product at issue is technically called an index 
participation but it resembles a basket of stocks because it 
allows investors to buy or sell something with a value tied to broad 
stock market indexes such as the standard amp poors 500 thats why 
its also called a stock basket 
a week ago a federal appeals court in chicago ruled the sec 
overstepped itself in authorizing three exchanges in new york 
philadelphia and chicago to trade stock baskets 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals held that the new financial 
instruments are futures contracts and should be regulated by the 
cftc throwing doubt on the legitimacy of the baskets traded on the 
stock exchanges 
its like being married for five years and finding out the 
preacher wasnt licensed says amex president kenneth r leibler 
and if you want to get married again you have to do it in a 
different state 
while the new products havent been a raging success since 
trading began may 12 in new york and philadelphia some observers 
they represent the future of the securities industry 
new product development became particularly important after the 
1987 stock crash which depressed the business of many investment 
firms and forced them to seek ways of luring investors back 
the american and philadelphia exchanges as well as the chicago 
board options exchange thought one answer would be stock baskets 
unlike stocks investors never actually buy the securities that 
make up a stock index and therefore have no ownership rights but 
unlike commodity futures theres no settlement or termination date 
the basket can be held indefinitely 
for example an investor could buy a basket tied to the sampp 500 
index when it has a value of 300 a monetary value is assigned to 
each contract usually sold in lots of 100 if the value was 30 or 
onetenth the sampp 500 index the basket would be worth 3000 and 
if the index went up 10 points the investor would make a profit of 
100 because the lot of 100 was now worth 3100 
but the stock baskets also represent a challenge to similar 
products offered by the two major futures exchanges in chicago the 
chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
those two exchanges claimed the stock baskets ought to be 
regulated by the cftc and the appeals court agreed saying the law 
creating the cftc clearly gave it authority in this case 
our feeling is the cftc is best equipped to regulate futures 
products because it has the expertise said michael oconnell a 
spokesman for the board of trade 
to us rep edward markey dmass chairman of the house finance 
subcommittee who has tried unsuccessfully to push market reform 
legislation the ruling highlights the problems inherent in this 
turf battle between the sec and the cftc said a markey spokesman 
but joanne medero the cftcs general counsel said i dont 
think the people here feel it is a turf battle not on the 
commissioner or staff level the turf battle may be more between the 
securities exchanges and the commodities exchanges rather than the 
agencies which is fine thats competition 
the cftc did file court papers in the chicago lawsuit stating its 
view that stock baskets are futures contracts and if the ruling is 
appealed ms medero said we would reiterate our position 
spokesmen for both stock and futures exchanges stopped short of 
saying another agency might not treat them fairly but indicated they 
preferred to deal with the one theyve known for years 
stock exchange officials noted that margins the amount of money 
or collateral that must be put up to buy securities are less 
stringent in the futures markets 
under cftc rules said nicholas giordano president of the 
philadelphia exchange the stock basket wont be a product that 
appeals to the public investor the man in the street itll be 
more speculative have higher risk and would not enjoy the 
protection of public investor rules that have been cultivated by the 
sec for 50 years 
the sec has yet to announce whether it will appeal the ruling by 
the chicago federal court 
i really cant tell you until we do it said paul gonson the 
secs solicitor although he confirmed that the agency was 
discussing alternatives with the exchanges
