vietnam told britain that it rejects 
the forced repatriation of refugees from hong kong and reserved the 
right to send them back to the british colony official vietnamese 
media reported friday 
a foreign ministry official handed a note on the issue to 
british ambassador to hanoi emrys davies said a vietnam news 
agency report in bangkok 
a group of 51 vietnamese were flown from hong kong to hanoi on 
tuesday in the first repatriation of boat people against their will 
however vietnamese authorities accepted the group back and the 
official media said without clear explanation that the repatriation 
was part of the framework of vietnams policy of rejecting 
forced repatriation 
according to the vietnam news agency the foreign ministry note 
strongly affirmed the policy of rejecting forced repatriation and 
and only accepting those who volunteer to return or who are not 
opposed to the repatriation 
it said the ministry official cautioned davies that any 
violation of these principles may hamper and even completely 
disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by 
step as agreed to at the multilateral conference on indochinese 
refugees held in geneva in june 
the agency said the ministry official stressed that if vietnam 
discovers any case of forced repatriation it reserves the right 
to return them to hong kong 
many of the 44000 vietnamese who have sailed into hong kong 
since june 1988 are considered illegal economic migrants unless 
they can prove they fled their communist homeland fearing 
persecution 
thousands have held demonstrations to protest the decision by 
britain its colony to force the return of the refugees a decision 
condemned by the united states

scientists excavating an ancient lake shore in 
virginia say a concentration of fossils there dates from a time 
when the area was a lush tropical forest and creatures resembling 
armored monsters roamed the earth 
hansdieter sues a smithsonian institution paleobiologist said 
thursday that the rich collection of fossil remains are from a 
variety of animals that lived 225 million years ago and some are of 
a type never before found 
many of these are not known because rocks from this particular 
chunk of time are not found anywhere else in the world said sues 
in an interview this is the first time that weve got a really 
diverse group of land animals from this part of geologic time 
sues said the largest assembled fossil includes the body but 
not the head of a fivefootlong reptile resembling an 
armorplated crocodile 
this creature had two rows on its back of this very massive 
bony plate and huge spines sticking out on the side said sues 
its like something from a japanese monster movie it is a 
funnylooking creature and an entirely new type of animal 
sues said the triassic period fossils were found in a formation 
of stone called mudrock about 15 miles southwest of richmond 
the assemblage includes many fossils from a group of animals 
called cynodonts the closest reptile ancestors of the mammal sues 
said the fossils include parts for a cynodont about the size of a 
small dog and other parts from a mammallike reptile measuring 5 
to 10 inches long 
sues said fragments of fossils of this type have been found in 
the northern hemisphere but never in such a large group 
individual cynodont fossils also have been found in argentina 
brazil and in southern africa 
this is further evidence for the super continent of pangaea 
when all of the continents were one large giant land mass he 
said because fossils from the same species and the same era can be 
found on continents that now are separated 
it is thought that during the geologic period called triassic 
between 240 to 205 million years ago all of the earths land area 
was connected in one large mass called pangaea the land mass 
slowly split apart as massive plates drifted away from each other 
over millions of years and the continents and islands eventually 
arranged themselves in their present positions 
sues said that when the cynodonts and other creatures lived in 
what is now virginia the area was near the equator and the climate 
was tropical and humid with lush vegetation 
you had these huge fresh water lakes and rivers throughout the 
whole area he said you had an incredible variety of animals 
there were plant eaters and a whole variety of meat eaters 
sues said the cynodont fossils found in the assemblage include 
five very small jaw bones apparently from hatchlings six larger 
jaw bones and the back bone and head from a stilllarger animal 
the cynodonts were creatures that were the precursors for true 
mammals he said they are not mammals themselves but were 
species that gave rise to mammals 
one of the small jaw fossils is attached to a detailed mold of 
the brain and sues said this may enable scientists to learn more 
about how the mammalian brain developed 
most of the triassic period reptiles died out as dinosaurs began 
to evolve into the dominant animal around the time the first 
mammal is thought to have evolved 
this find gives further evidence that mammals and dinosaurs 
probably evolved at the same time sues said the dinosaur 
became very successful and remained successful for the next 140 
million years and mammals were sort of pushed over the side and 
only became important and successful after the dinosaurs went 
extinct 
dinosaurs became extinct for reasons still not understood 
about 65 million years ago and mammals such as mankind evolved 
into the dominant animal 
the fossil deposit was found by paul e olsen a geologist with 
the columbia university lamontdoherty geological observatory 
olsen was conducting a survey in the area in 1985 sues said 
and chanced onto a small fossil sues identified it as a cynodont 
part and the national geographic society supported further 
exploration leading to the discovery of the large fossil deposit

three members of congress want to know if the 
national institutes of health are making good on a promise to stop 
testing only men when seeking cures to diseases that also affect 
women 
reps patricia schroeder dcolo olympia snowe rmaine and 
henry waxman dcalif on thursday asked the general accounting 
office to investigate a policy adopted in 1987 after a report from 
the public health service showed sex discrimination at nih clinical 
tests 
the gender bias in medical research isnt confined to the lab 
it filters down to the health care that women receive said 
schroeder 
if a woman wants to know if she should take an aspirin every 
other day to help prevent heart disease or take a 
cholesterollowering drug to bring down her cholesterol level her 
doctor wont have the answer all of the research in this area has 
been done on men said the congresswoman 
she was referring to two studies that were highly criticized for 
excluding women the multiple risk factor intervention trials 
which studied coronary disease risk factors and the physicians 
health study which inspected use of aspirin as preventive therapy 
for coronary disease 
both studies were started before 1987 
snowe said she feared the treatments developed from these 
menonly studies might be useless or even harmful when applied to 
women 
the national institutes of health are aware of this problem 
but we want to know what success theyve had in including more 
women in medical research said snowe after all you dont 
test apples to see what happens to oranges 
the institutes which together have a 768 billion budget are 
funding hundreds of studies on their bethesda md campus and 
through grants to universities and private companies throughout the 
country they comprise the nations largest medical research agency 
dr millicent higgins who helps decide who will do research for 
the national heart lung and blood institute at nih said 
observational studies were including women all along the problem 
was in experimentation 
the studies started recently include women she said but 
she said the gao audit will determine the degree to which women are 
involved in clinical testing 
the policy established by nih in 1987 did not have any target 
date or quotas for increasing women in clinical tests 
a research official in another institute at nih said she didnt 
think women were being excluded intentionally 
it was like everything else in our society said dr 
florence hazeltine director of the center for population research 
within the national institute of child health and human 
development women are secondclass citizens so they are thought 
of second 
hazeltine said that because men dominate medical research they 
often study problems related to themselves 
weve heard this for several years said howard lewis of 
the american heart association i think the people making the 
decisions are getting the message 
schroeder snowe and waxman said they want the gao report by 
april before waxmans energy and commerce subcommittee on health 
and the environment begins authorization hearings of the nih budget 
for the next fiscal year 
among the questions asked by the members of congress are 
has nih refused to issue any grants because the applications 
did not comply with the policy to include women 
have any grants been given waivers 
what is the cost of including women in clinical tests what are 
the cost implications of continuing to exclude them 
what are the gender race ethnic origin and age of the people 
used in clinical trials which studies used predominantly one 
gender race ethnic group or age group

ferdinand marcos had full knowledge of an 
intelligence conspiracy that led to the 1981 murders of two 
antimarcos activists in seattle a lawyer told jurors thursday 
but a defense attorney said that although its easy to see the 
late philippines dictator as the personification of excess and 
evil no evidence indicates the deaths of silme domingo and gene 
viernes were caused by anything other than a local union dispute 
the lawyers comments came during closing arguments in a civil 
lawsuit accusing marcos his widow imelda and others of running 
an intelligence network that harassed and intimidated antimarcos 
elements in this country 
plaintiffs claim defendant dr leonilo malabed of san francisco 
ran an intelligence slush fund for marcos that paid for the 
murders and that the payoff was delivered to the killers by 
defendant tony baruso who was president of the alaska cannery 
workers union 
domingo and viernes who were reformist officers of the union 
were shot in its offices on june 1 1981 
marcos intelligence network ran amok and marcos did nothing 
to stop it plaintiffs attorney michael withey said 
marcos had full knowledge of the conspiracy and not only 
foresaw but condoned acts of harassment and physical violence 
against his opponents in the united states withey told the us 
district court jury that is hearing the case against the marcoses 
judge barbara rothstein will judge the liability of five other 
defendants in the lawsuit which seeks millions of dollars in 
damages for the victims survivors 
withey said the murders were made to look like a union dispute 
hotheaded filipinos shooting it out vicious thuggery but 
evidence clearly showed marcos headed an extensive intelligence 
network not only in the philippines but in the united states he 
said 
were talking about so many spy agencies you cant even count 
them all withey said 
at the start of the trial thanksgiving week marcos defense 
lawyer richard hibey had painted domingo and viernes as small fry 
in the antimarcos movement laboring in a smaller vineyard 
than more prominent activists 
but withey noted viernes had traveled to the philippines to meet 
with the largest and most threatening labor organization marcos 
had ever encountered and that both men had sponsored a 
resolution critical of marcos at a hawaii labor convention 
mr hibey may have thought the vineyard was small but 
ferdinand marcos knew better withey said 
three men linked to a filipino gang were convicted of murder on 
the theory that domingo and viernes were victims of an internal 
union dispute over work assignments and gambling in alaska fish 
canneries 
there was turmoil in this union there were bribes there was 
violence there were gangs there was murder hibey said 
sure its easy to look upon ferdinand and imelda marcos as 
the personification of excess and evil thats what the case 
panders to he said 
dont be so blinded by it to seize on the target of two 
incredibly unpopular people and hold them accountable for that 
which is not theirs to account 
but withey said evidence didnt support that explanation 
the evidence establishes that domingo and viernes were far 
more than antimarcos activists who happened to be killed in an 
unrelated dispute he said they were very active and effective 
antimarcos activists 
the jurors must decide whether the marcoses were part of a 
conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent 
in exercising control over their intelligence network 
rothstein on thursday granted a motion by the philippines 
government to be dismissed from the suit 
in a videotaped deposition made before his death last september 
marcos who was overthrown in february 1986 took the fifth 
amendment privilege against selfincrimination when asked about his 
connections with malabed

a survey of bankers shows them to be in basic 
agreement with agriculture department experts that 1990 will be a 
brighter year for farmers and the rural economy 
the usda projects some improvement in net cash income of 
farmers perhaps to around 54 billion or so compared with an 
estimated 53 billion this year 
net cash income is the money farmers have left over from gross 
cash earnings after paying cash expenses 
department economists also predict 1990 increases in farmland 
prices farm assets and equity values which are important 
indicators of financial condition 
overall the financial condition of farmers is stronger now 
than at any other time in the last several years says the 
departments economic research service this is largely due to 
cautious investment behavior effective cost control increased 
cash financing and continued restructuring and writeoffs of 
outstanding debt 
the american bankers association said its survey of 60 bankers 
at the groups annual conference last month in st louis mo 
indicated optimism for the rural economy in 1990 sixty percent 
said they were optimistic about the outlook for the rural economy 
eight percent said it would worsen 
in general the bankers said they believe farmers next year 
will plant more acreage use fewer chemicals sell more products 
to foreign markets sign up for more crop insurance and increase 
their use of computers for their records 
about 48 percent of the bankers responding to the survey said 
competition from other banks and the farm credit system would be 
the biggest issue for them in 1990 rural development was second 
with 28 percent 
the bankers were not so optimistic about the use of the farmers 
home administrations guaranteed loan program half said they 
expect to make fewer fmhaguaranteed loans next year while 25 
percent said they expected an increase and 25 percent no change 
the results apparently reflect the bankers concerns over what 
they consider to be the burdensome paperwork involved in the 
program the association said 
but when it comes to ending federal subsidies to farmers 67 
percent of the bankers said they were opposed to scrapping the 
payments 
nearly all of the bankers surveyed 95 percent said so far 
they have not had to pay for cleanup costs on environmentally 
contaminated collateral or property the association reported 
likewise a majority 93 percent of the bankers said animal 
rights laws have not affected whether they would make a loan 
the american bankers association calls itself the national 
trade and professional association for americas commercial banks 
of all sizes assets of aba member banks are about 95 percent of 
the industry total

the republic of singapore has produced its 
first litter of testtube pigs a step the island nation hopes will 
lead to a supply of genetically superior swine for southeast asia 
a report by the agriculture departments trade officer in 
singapore said the potential market for such breeder pigs is 
estimated at 18 million sows or 270 million in southeast asia 
alone 
companies in britain australia and the united states have 
expressed a keen interest in using singapore as an agrotechnology 
service base the report said 
singapore is eliminating traditional methods of pork production 
which require extensive land use and create pollution 
the birth of the piglets marks the beginning of efforts to 
modernize production and to create a stock of elite genetically 
superior breeding pigs which can be built up for mass production 
throughout the region the report said 
veterinary surgeons implanted a surrogate sow with donated 
embryos last spring resulting in the birth of seven offspring in 
september 
the report said the surrogate mother can be adapted to local 
conditions allowing her to pass on antibodies to local diseases to 
her young because the risk of disease is reduced the chance of 
survival is increased 
also the cost of transporting embryos is less expensive than 
live animals and disease transmission is minimized

the soviet union bought us poultry meat this 
year for the first time in a decade but agriculture department 
analysts say the future potential of the soviet market is uncertain 
sale of 33 million pounds of broiler leg quarters this fall 
was the first since 1980 and that one was halted by the partial 
embargo ordered by thenpresident carter in retaliation for the 
soviet unions invasion of afghanistan 
thus said the departments economic research service there had 
not been actual shipments of us poultry meat to the soviet union 
since 1977 
broader soviet policies toward providing consumer goods and 
us prices relative to european broiler prices will be among the 
factors influencing future sales the agency said russia 
traditionally imports poultry meat from eastern european countries 
primarily hungary and is expected to continue such arrangements 
in 1988 hungary exported almost 70 percent of the estimated 395 
million pounds of poultry imported by the soviet union

house republican whip newt gingrich is 
appealing to his past campaign contributors to help pay more than 
125000 in legal fees for preparing his defense against ethics 
charges 
rich galen a spokesman for the georgia congressman said 
thursday that gingrich sent an urgent fundraising letter last week 
to some 12000 previous contributors seeking help with his legal 
bills 
two washington attorneys former arkansas rep ed bethune and 
dan swillinger have been preparing a defense so gingrich will be 
ready if the house ethics committee decides to launch a formal 
investigation of two complaints filed against him by rep bill 
alexander dark galen said 
its like buying insurance the spokesman said you hope 
you dont have to use it 
the ethics committee has taken no formal action on either 
complaint the first alleges that gingrich violated house rules and 
federal campaign finance laws by getting 21 investors to put up 
5000 each to promote his 1984 book window of opportunity 
an outside counsel hired to evaluate that complaint concluded in 
october that there were not sufficient grounds for the panel to 
investigate gingrich who was elected house gop whip after filing 
the ethics complaint that led to the resignation last june of 
former speaker jim wright 
after the outside counsel made its recommendation alexander 
filed another complaint along with 670 pages of supporting 
documents accusing gingrich of ethics and campaign finance 
violations in seven new areas 
galen said gingrich sent out the fundraising appeal because he 
does not have enough money in his campaign account to pay the 
attorneys bills 
gingrich reported to the federal election commission on june 30 
that he had 35847 in leftover debts from his 1988 reelection 
campaign and a cash balance in his 1990 campaign account of 50297

college graduates in 1990 can look forward to a 
job market much like 1989s a year of good growth with 
engineering students pulling in the highest starting salaries 
according to an annual survey released thursday 
but the author of the survey said the 260 businesses surveyed 
were more cautious in their economic outlook than they were a year 
ago with 44 percent saying they expected business to be about the 
same and 6 percent predicting a decline fifty percent said they 
expected a slightly better business climate in 1990 
this is a rather unusual balance a decidedly mixed 
outlook said victor lindquist author of the northwestern 
university lindquistendicott report of 1990 
although there appears to be economic stability with limited 
growth there is vulnerability in the marketplace said 
lindquist associate dean and director of placement at the school 
if a decline in business becomes pronounced and widespread there 
will be an immediate and sudden drop in job opportunities for 
college graduates 
the 44th annual lindquistendicott report surveyed medium to 
large businesses and industrial companies among those surveyed 
were major employers in banking finance merchandising 
electronics and public utilities 
lindquist said there is a rather good match this year 
between the number of students entering the job market and the jobs 
available but he predicted by 1992 there will be more jobs than 
students because of a declining pool of students 
he said that on average starting salaries for this springs 
graduates would be up 39 percent over last spring lagging 
slightly behind inflation but he noted a new trend in which 24 
percent of businesses offered signing bonuses of about 3000 on 
average to students who actually accept jobs 
students with engineering degrees can expect to earn an average 
32304 starting salary the highest among their peers the report 
said those majoring in computer sciences and chemistry are not far 
behind with average starting salaries of 29100 and 29088 
respectively 
linquist said the outlook should continue to be strong for 
computer science majors 
accounting majors got the biggest percentage salary increase up 
58 percent over last years figure to an average of 27408 while 
starting salaries in salesmarketing showed the smallest increase 
up 2 percent to 27828 
lindquist said companies are spending more money recruiting at 
colleges and universities and noted a little bit of craziness 
in which some companies hold college receptions complete with 
caviar shrimp and exotic pates 
but he said companies continue to seek the old standbys good 
grades and extracurricular activities

the public utility commission thursday 
fined philadelphia electric co 50000 for improperly cutting off 
electricity to customers including a family who resorted to using 
candles that started a fatal fire 
the puc said the utility also must contribute 400000 to an 
energy assistance fund for needy families as part of a settlement 
regarding customer service violations over a twoyear period 
the most publicized case was last april when peco cut off 
electricity to a philadelphia family who used candles to light 
their home 
eleven days later a fire started in their row home in the 
citys fairmount section and killed sevenyearold robert 
blackwell his fiveyearold brother jason blackwell received 
thirddegree burns over 35 percent of his body 
an puc investigation determined peco did not alert a 
responsible adult in the family that service would be 
terminated but instead told a neighbor 
the commission said the utility also did not provide a 48hour 
termination notice and would not agree to payment plan offered 
twice by the family to clear up the delinquent bill 
mitchell miller chief of the pucs consumer research said the 
blackwells owed 73801 peco terminated service and wanted 338 to 
reconnect the electricity and asked the family to pay 20 a month 
afterwards 
the blackwells received state assistance and could not afford 
the amount miller said he said peco would not accept any other 
payment arrangements 
they treated this family like they were mellon bank 
commissioner joseph rhodes jr said they didnt take into 
consideration as required by law the blackwells ability to 
pay 
after reading the pucs report rhodes said he concluded 
pecos violations of regulations directly and significantly 
contributed to the death of robert blackwell and the maiming of 
jason blackwell 
puc chairman william shane said he believes the utilitys 
violations and sloppy administration contributed to the fatal fire 
he said philadelphia electric had been fined 50000 for similar 
violations in 1987 peco was also forced to pay 150000 to an 
energy assistance fund 
peco spokesman neil mcdermott said the fatal fire cannot be 
linked to the companys termination of service 
shane said it is quite disturbing that peco did not modify 
its behavior after the 1987 fines 
i think a 400000 fine has good possibilities for behavior 
modification shane said noting that the greatest driving force 
for change is the death 
without question if you look at the report of the bureau of 
consumer services in this case the company has made substantial 
progress from where it was two years ago mcdermott said

nearly three of every four rural households 
pay more for housing than the government considers affordable with 
about a quarter of all rural residents living in substandard 
dwellings says a new report 
to many americans the lowincome housing crisis is primarily 
an urban problem calling up visions of homeless men and women 
sleeping on steam grates and of families in city welfare hotels 
said robert greenstein director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities 
yet in rural america too there is a crisis in housing for 
lowincome people greenstein said 
his organization and the housing assistance council coauthored 
the report released thursday 
sen terry sanford dnc said the report demonstrates the 
need for his rural housing legislation 
sanford has introduced a bill that would increase funding for 
farmers home administration rural housing programs by 500 million 
over two years targeting rural communities that traditionally do 
not get much help from the federal government 
in my home state of north carolina 12 rural counties have 
poverty rates over 20 percent and occupied substandard housing 
rates over 10 percent said sanford some 100000 north 
carolina households still use outhouses 
the report found that 42 percent of rural poor households spent 
at least half of their income on housing in 1985 the most recent 
year for which data is available it said 26 percent spent 70 
percent or more for housing 
the department of housing and urban development has standards 
that say housing is not considered affordable unless it is 30 
percent or less of a familys income 
while an earlier department of agriculture study showed its 
more expensive to live in urban areas the study released by the 
two organizations thursday says more rural residents live in 
substandard housing than city dwellers 
according to the report the worst rural housing is in the south 
the study showed that 83 percent of all rural housing units with 
rats were in the south as were 79 percent of the homes with 
inadequate waste disposal 73 percent with holes in the floor 61 
percent with inadequate heating 53 percent with cracks in the 
walls and 52 percent with inadequate water supplies 
the study was based on data released in february 1989 by the 
bureau of the census and hud in a study called the american housing 
survey of the united states in 1985 
the center for budget and policy priorities is an independent 
research organization that specializes in issues affecting low and 
moderateincome groups 
the housing assistance council promotes development of 
lowincome rural housing through seedmoney loans technical

a landlords lawyer plans to appeal the 
release of iris the dog and whitehill the cat who had been 
impounded in a dispute over back rent 
civil court judge thomas early signed an order this week 
releasing the animals seized dec 6 with lynell zelenkas car as 
security for the money 
the nightmare is over said zelenka hugging her 7yearold 
saluki and her 11yearold mixedbreed cat 
landlord john chambers said she owes him 12000 in rent which 
he agreed to let go unpaid while her lawsuit over a back injury was 
pending he claims she settled the injury suit recently and failed 
to tell him 
but zelenka who admits owing chambers 6000 ended up with 
only 750 after paying attorney fees and medical expenses early 
was told tuesday 
the judge said he has yet to decide how much rent zelenka owes 
but he ruled zelenkas pets have value only to her and unlike a 
cow or a horse would bring no money if put up for sale 
this is a form of hostage so to speak to take the dog and 
the cat why should the dog and the cat be pulled into the 
middle of this thing and deprived of the love of their master

opposition leaderplaywright 
vaclav havel has gained more support for the presidency with 
40000 supporters cheering him in the streets and the nations 
roman catholic primate joining his chorus of backers 
the opposition and communist leaders planned to resume 
negotiations toward selecting the new president communist 
hardliner gustav husak resigned sunday after swearing in the first 
government here since 1948 not dominated by communists 
opposition spokesman lubos dobrovsky told a news conference 
thursday night that negotiations would resume soon but did not say 
when 
he said negotiators were exhausted after intense discussions 
that lasted until late wednesday and decided to take thursday night 
off 
about 40000 people poured into wenceslas square in prague on 
thursday to show their support for havel the rally was called by 
students who were the vanguard of the prodemocracy movement 
police action on nov 17 against peaceful student demonstrators 
left 143 injured and launched the peaceful revolution that forced 
the communists to relinquish their monopoly on power 
havel for president and we want havel chanted the 
crowd thursday 
the voice of czechoslovak primate cardinal frantisek tomasek on 
thursday joined others supporting havel according to the state 
news agency ctk 
my choice for the function of the countrys president is mr 
vaclav havel fighter for the right justice and truth not only 
for himself but for all of us wrote the popular 91yearold 
cardinal in a statement of support carried by ctk 
the talks wednesday night at first seemed to have produced 
agreement in how a new president would be named 
under the constitution the federal assembly has two weeks after 
the resignation to elect a new head of state and avoid a 
constitutional crisis 
opposition leaders thought they reached an understanding with 
the communist party in earlier negotiations that havel would be 
named president until free elections next year 
but the 350member communistdominated parliament has resisted 
electing the former dissident who spent years in jail for fighting 
communist rule and defending human rights 
in parliamentary sessions tuesday and wednesday the communist 
deputies introduced a proposal to hold a referendum to choose the 
new head of state 
negotiators met until late wednesday and concluded by issuing a 
joint statement saying the deadline would be extended by a 
constitutional amendment to give parliament 45 days to select the 
president 
communist party spokesman josef hora said the party would make 
its decision on the issue at a special congress set for dec 2021 
the partys shifts indicated a split in party ranks between 
reformminded members and those associated with the old 
discredited regime of hardliners 
also suggesting divisions within communist ranks was the 
announcement that slovak party boss ignac janak stepped down 
thursday from the communist party politburo and frantisek hanus 
resigned from the party secretariat

the pentagon has proposed halting 
roundtheclock flights of an airborne command post that since 1961 
has had orders to take charge of nuclear forces if the president 
and other leaders were killed the new york times reported friday 
according to pentagon officials the defense department is 
instead proposing that the planes be changed to continuous ground 
alert with specified number of sorties per week 
the pentagon recommendation made amid growing defense budgetary 
restraints and the belief the threat of a surprise soviet nuclear 
attack is diminishing needs president bushs authorization 
one official told the times the plan has not drawn strong 
objections from within the defense department where some 
preliminary defense budget recommendations were reversed after 
debate 
the air force maintains on a rotating basis a fleet of planes 
collectively known as looking glass that has been under the 
command of the strategic air command in omaha neb in the event 
us leaders were killed during nuclear war a sac general would 
assume command of nuclear forces 
the proposal which originated at sac would save about 20 
million in fiscal 1990 the plan is one of several recommendations 
to change defense planning and spending

younger people with limited educations are more 
likely than anyone to light up and should be the target of 
campaigns against cigarettes a study released by the federal 
centers for disease control concluded 
a 1988 survey of about 20000 people in 36 states and the 
district of columbia found that lesseducated people who also tend 
to be of a lower social and economic status are more likely to be 
smokers 
there has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking but the 
study shows most of the progress is limited to the welleducated 
said dr luis escobedo of the atlantabased cdc who analyzed 
aspects of the survey released thursday 
the emphasis must become more targeted he said some of 
that already is being done through substance abuse programs 
tobacco is an addictive substance 
escobedo said the national cancer institute has a program in 
innercity schools working to reduce the odds of children becoming 
regular smokers as do private institutes and some state health 
departments 
the random telephone survey sought people 18 or older 
results showed that for people older than 35 the likelihood of 
being a current smoker increased with each decrease in the level of 
education 
but for those ages 18 to 34 the chance of being a current 
smoker decreased substantially only for those with more than a high 
school education while smoking rates for high school dropouts and 
those with high school diplomas were more nearly equal 
the study said cultural factors such as the high mormon 
population in utah also may affect who smokes utah had the lowest 
rate of smokers in its over18 population 181 percent and former 
smokers 91 percent 
kentucky had the highest percentage of current smokers 379 
percent the highest percentage of former smokers was in maine 
203 percent 
the median figure for current smokers was 262 percent meaning 
half the states were above that figure and half below the median 
figure for former smokers was 151 percent 
the study said other factors affecting who smokes include 
smoking prevention activities such as school programs state 
cigarette taxes and the intensity of promotional events and 
advertising by the tobacco industry 
the study found that 41 percent of the 18to34 group with less 
than a high school education are smokers the figure dropped to 
about 34 percent for those with a high school education and 19 
percent to those with more than a high school education 
in older age groups the education difference between smokers and 
nonsmokers was much less pronounced 
the survey is part of a continuing study done annually since 
1980 with more states participating each year

the told listeners where the snipers 
were hiding where the bombs were falling they filled the airwaves 
with information some of it frenetic some of it wrong all of it 
thrilling 
im hit screamed a woman reporter over the air when a shell 
landed nearby she continued to broadcast as her van rushed her to 
the hospital where doctors found she was suffering only from shock 
such was the wild freewheeling style of radio reporting here 
during the eightday uprising launched by mutinous soldiers on dec 
1 in an unsuccessful effort to topple president corazon aquino 
filipinos listened to the rebellion on the radio absorbed by 
roundtheclock running coverage by what is the major medium for 
news and information here 
we got threats from all kinds of people almost every day 
said nolan sison managing editor of dzrh radio we tried to 
balance our reporting and the threats from both sides made us 
think we did have a balanced programming 
differences in reporting style showed the slant of individual 
stations 
reporters and anchormen for dzmm screamed at colleagues from 
rival stations for airing tactical information such as 
positions of government forces and the types of firearms and 
vehicles used 
you are traitors to our country a reporter lectured on the 
air 
as tension mounted the government warned it would strictly 
enforce existing guidelines giving it authority to close stations 
that broadcast hostile propaganda or disinformation 
newspapers are exempt from such controls publishers say they 
received no directives from the government on what to print 
individual reporters claim however they have been lectured by 
military and civilian officials angry at stories perceived as 
favorable to the rebels 
the national telecommunications commission closed manila radio 
station dzec after it erroneously reported that mrs aquino fled 
the palace at the height of the coup attempt 
the station has been the chief outlet of supporters of ferdinand 
marcos who died in hawaiian exile this year after being ousted as 
president in february 1986 
the commission also shut down cebu radio station dyla after it 
broadcast a taped interview of rebel leader brig gen edgardo 
abenina a week later the commission reopened the station at the 
request of church leaders 
so far the government has issued no formal warnings against 
other stations it did not prevent the stations from interviewing 
rebels after they gave up strongholds in the makati financial 
district on dec 7 despite the ban on rebel propaganda 
but stations that adopted a more balanced editorial policy faced 
another problem fending off threats from both government 
officials and the rebels 
sison of dzrh said the staff received frequent calls from 
defense secretary fidel ramos and military officials demanding that 
the station omit detailed reports of rebel attacks on military 
camps 
rebels also demanded that reporters covering the street fighting 
broadcast their propaganda 
brig gen oscar florendo chief of the militarycivil relations 
office complained at one point that such detailed reporting was 
helping rebel soldiers correct their aim during air and artillery 
attacks at the armed forces headquarters at camp aguinaldo 
stations also received threats from mutineers who demanded that 
they transmit only rebel propaganda one reporter who spoke on 
condition that his name and station not be mentioned said rebels 
threatened him after management refused to broadcast his interview 
with them 
television stations reacted more cautiously all but one of the 
five manila stations including the government station went off 
the air on the first day of the coup attempt 
technicians at the four stations removed essential transmitter 
parts to keep rebel soldiers from seizing their facilities and 
telecasting propaganda 
in 1987 rebel forces loyal to marcos took over private 
radiotelevision station gma7 and broadcast statements 
gma officials said they learned from that experience and decided 
to resume operations days later when it looked like the conflict 
was over 
as the coup attempt unfolded stations exercised a degree of 
selfcensorship by bowing to government demands that they avoid 
detailed reports of tactical operations 
several continued broadcasting reports of shelling at camp 
aguinaldo and elsewhere for example but would not state precisely 
where the rounds were falling government officers complained the 
rebels were monitoring the reports and adjusting their aim 
accordingly 
stations still reported movements of government forces but 
without detailing exactly how many troops were deployed 
at least 113 people died in the coup the most serious attempt 
yet to topple mrs aquino

from national hero to shunned exile to popular 
lawmaker andrei d sakharovs remarkable journey of conscience 
made him perhaps the worlds most celebrated dissident 
his life was a great irony the physicist who developed the 
soviet hydrogen bomb went on to become his nations greatest 
advocate of human rights at a time when the world lived under the 
shadow of nuclear war 
he spoke out for democracy when many others were silent he kept 
speaking out when it became fashionable under the reforms of 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
hours before he died at age 68 he stood on the floor of the 
soviet congress of peoples deputies and demanded that the 
squabbling opposition form an alternative party to the ruling 
communists 
we cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the 
leadership is doing now he said speaking in an official forum 
the type of words that sent him into internal exile for six years 
that won him a nobel peace prize 
selfless brave and determined the stooped disheveled dean of 
soviet dissent lived to see many of his dreams come true his own 
people began to acknowledge his greatness as the rest of the world 
had done earlier 
but sakharov was never satisfied saluting reforms but faulting 
their inadequacy he constantly challenged even the man who turned 
many of his dreams into reality and set him free after nearly seven 
years in exile 
i personally respect mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev very much 
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of 
perestroika sakharov boldly told the soviet congress in june 
after it added the presidency to gorbachevs job as communist party 
general secretary 
born the son of a physicist on may 21 1921 sakharovs early 
fame was not as a political activist but as a brilliant scientist 
he was inducted into the academy of sciences in 1953 at age 32 the 
hallowed halls youngest member ever 
in 1948 he joined physicist igor tamm in developing the 
hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived and worked in 
secrecy with privileges that included a good apartment a driver 
a high salary and a government awards 
but like albert einstein sakharov began to worry about the 
morality of developing weapons of mass destruction he had his 
first major brush with top soviet officials in 1961 when he 
appealed to premier nikita s khrushchev to stop nuclear weapons 
tests 
khrushchev responded that scientists shouldnt meddle in 
politics two years later the soviet union agreed to such limits 
in a treaty with the united states 
sakharov horrified at soviet societys mistreatment of its own 
citizens once said his social and political views underwent a 
major evolution he risked his prestigious position and began 
using his influence for victims of human rights abuses in 1966 
speaking out for those who suffered under dictator josef stalins 
repressions 
the authorities showed their rage in 1968 when sakharovs 
progress coexistence and intellectual freedom was published 
abroad it called for sovietamerican detente well before the 
concept became part of soviet foreign policy saying progress in 
disarmament is impossible without human rights and political 
changes in the soviet union he was banned from work on secret 
projects 
sakharov called the essay a turning point in my life and two 
years later he helped found the moscow human rights committee in 
1971 after the death of his first wife he married yelena bonner 
a leningrad doctor and human rights activist who was to become his 
constant feisty companion 
in 1975 he won even greater world recognition and was awarded 
the nobel peace prize 
the soviets on the other hand condemned his strong criticism 
of the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan 
first they stripped him of his awards and then on jan 22 1980 
he was pickup up on a moscow street and banished to internal exile 
in gorky a closed city 200 miles east 
in an autobiographical statement written in 1981 sakharov 
reflected on his approach to human rights 
moral criteria in combination with unrestricted inquiry 
provide the only possible compass for these complex and 
contradictory problems today as always i believe in the 
power of reason and the human spirit sakharov wrote 
western governments scientific and human rights groups pressed 
the soviets to release him in december 1986 a phone was suddenly 
installed in sakharovs gorky apartment and gorbachev called to 
say he could return to moscow 
sakharov suppressing his joy at the news to show his concern 
for others told gorbachev to free all political prisoners 
two months after sakharovs release scores of political 
prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind gorbachev he 
gradually was rehabilitated getting his old job back at the 
academy of sciences speaking at official conferences and giving 
interviews to the soviet press 
in november 1988 he was allowed to travel abroad for the first 
time even though gorbachev himself had said earlier sakharov could 
not travel to other countries because he had access to state 
secrets 
although he professed not to aspire to politics sakharov was 
elected to represent the academy in the new congress academy 
leaders had initially rejected him but had to reverse the decision 
after a popular outcry 
sakharovs rumpled figure and highpitched voice became familiar 
to millions of soviets watching his televised appearances at the 
congress and fellow parliamentarian yeltsin called him the 
nations conscience 
age and poor health curtailed his human rights activities he 
looked far older than his years but when he felt he had to speak 
out he did such as his condemnation of the crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators in china in june 1989 and constant 
complaints that gorbachevs economic and political reforms did not 
go far enough 
even though he was a poor speaker with a slight stutter and 
highpitched voice the public had come to know and like sakharov 
so much that an unscientific poll by a soviet newspaper in october 
1989 indicated he was the most popular parliamentarian outscoring 
even gorbachev and the maverick communist boris n yeltsin 
in a february 1989 tribute to sakharov the weekly magazine 
ogonyok praised a person who had earlier been cursed and 
published his longsuppressed essays and letters 
the soviet press had come a long way from the preglasnost days 
when it branded him a traitor and utterly ignorant person who 
groveled before the capitalist order

sen dave durenberger rminn made at least 
40 expensepaid speaking appearances to earn 100000 through a 
book contract hes accused of using to launder honoraria records 
show 
his minneapolis publisher said thursday the speaking fees 
enabled him to show a profit on durenbergers two books on health 
and defense policy and allowed the senator to record the earnings 
as salary 
the senate ethics committee which has hired a special counsel 
to determine whether durenberger used the book deal to circumvent 
senate honoraria limits has subpoenaed records from organizations 
that paid the fees as well as from publisher gary l diamond 
durenberger amended his senate financial disclosure statements 
in recent months to list the 40 expensepaid speaking appearances 
many of them in such locales as bermuda and palm springs calif 
the speaking appearances include an engagement with the american 
podiatric medical association in chicago in 1986 where there was 
not even a mention of the book or books said john carson 
director of government affairs for the group 
carson said a 2000 check was sent to diamonds piranha press 
but he considered it from day one up to the current moment as a 
fee for the purpose of the senator making a speech to our 
audience 
durenberger who says he cleared the book deal through the 
federal election commission contends he broke no senate rules 
aides said he would not respond to questions about the deals now 
under investigation 
the book deal is one of three plans durenberger had for boosting 
his income at a time he was having financial and marital 
difficulties two of the arrangements are being looked at by the 
ethics committee the book matter and allegations that durenberger 
arranged speeches in 1985 and 1986 to coincide with appointments he 
and his wife had with a marriage counselor in boston 
the committee also could be asked to look at payments the senate 
made to durenberger for his rental of a minneapolis condominium in 
which he owned an interest 
diamond says it was his idea not durenbergers to have 
diamonds piranha press division publish the two books neither 
madmen nor messiahs and prescription for change 
but it was the senators idea to use piranha press as a 
speakers bureau to make money for both men from durenbergers 
appearances diamond said 
he sold 13000 copies of his books not enough to cover the cost 
of printing them diamond said the 200000 earned from the 
senators speaking appearances enabled the publisher to net a 
50000 profit said diamond 
that was not the intent at the time we went into it we 
thought most of the money would be from the sales but it just 
didnt work out that way i thought we would sell more than we 
did diamond said in a telephone interview 
diamond estimates special interest groups paid piranha press 
about 200000 to hear durenberger speak over the twoyear period 
durenberger ended the contract because of the criticism he 
received although the fec concluded that payments from his 
publisher would constitute a stipend rather than speaking fees he 
said 
i believe i made a good faith effort to comply with the law by 
contacting the fec and seeking its opinion in advance of any work i 
did under the agreement durenberger said in a statement his 
office issued recently 
the complaint before the ethics committee contends durenberger 
misrepresented the deal to the fec 
durenberger lists 23 appearances in 1985 in connection with the 
books including trips to new orleans hilton head sc and four 
cities in florida his 17 engagements in 1986 took him to palm 
springs twice and bermuda and monterey calif once each 
durenberger filed the amendments to his financial disclosure 
statements as a result of discussions between his aides and the 
senate ethics committee staff said his press secretary carrie 
collins 
the ethics committee staff has refused to comment on the 
investigation but the senators office confirmed the panel 
subpoenaed records about the speaking engagements

president bush calling this years holiday 
the christmas weve awaited for 50 years is urging americans 
to celebrate by reaching out to someone in need 
bush with an assist from his 3yearold granddaughter marshall 
threw a switch to light the national christmas tree on thursday 
night carrying on a tradition that calvin coolidge started in 1923 
he used the ceremony before about 12000 people opening the 
pageant of peace on the ellipse both to celebrate the bells of 
freedom ringing across europe and to nudge americans once again 
to aid the less fortunate 
bush even got into the shopping spirit earlier thursday making 
a personal expedition to a local sears store to buy presents 
clothing not toys for his 11 grandchildren he came prepared 
with a list and paid cash 
unlike his predecessor ronald reagan who used to light the 
national christmas tree from the white house bush went to the 
ellipse to light the 35foot living blue spruce decorated this 
winter to symbolize bushs thousand points of light 
describing the dramatic strides toward democracy that have 
unfolded in eastern europe bush declared this is the christmas 
that weve awaited for 50 years 
now he said 1989 is ending bright with the prospect of a far 
better christmas time than europe has ever known a far better 
future the world dared to imagine 
with the berlin wall tumbling down and spring returned to 
prague he said the glad sound you hear is not only the bells of 
christmas but also the bells of freedom 
turning his thoughts toward home bush said 
weve worked hard this year all of us all of you to help 
build a better america to help make this a kinder and gentler 
nation 
but there remains a world of need all around us in this 
holiday season reach out to someone right where you live he 
said 
from now on in america theres no room at the inn thats 
simply not an acceptable answer said the president 
the national christmas tree is a living blue spruce transplanted 
to its permanent spot on the ellipse in 1978 
the ceremony which kicked off the 1989 pageant of peace on the 
ellipse took place despite some starcrossed microphones 
when singer loretta lynn tried to belt out a good old country 
christmas her cordless microphone flickered on and off a 
stagehand gave her another mike it was dead 
lynn corralled master of ceremonies willard scott dressed in a 
santa claus suit and began singing into the mike beneath his beard 
im glad i had one beard to give for my country quipped the 
jocular weatherman 
later singer marilyn mccoo found herself without amplification 
and pageant president joseph h riley couldnt be heard introducing 
bush 
some speakers cut off in midceremony for the president 
before retreating to the white house bush leaned over and 
intoned into scotts beard site of the only reliable microphone 
santa you did a fine job

their trial is the last of five that began nov 22 in tokyo 
district court 
more than just legal proceedings the court actions are 
examinations of the cozy relationship between japanese government 
and business 
the recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down prime 
minister noboru takeshita who resigned last spring after 
acknowledging he received large donations from the giant 
information services conglomerate 
other key figures in the governing liberal democratic party have 
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking 
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from 
recruit 
like the other three defendants ezoe accused prosecutors of 
mistreating him 
the prosecutors questioned me from morning to night when i 
tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the 
point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing he said 
fujinami 56 was chief cabinet secretary under prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone takeshitas predecessor he is accused of 
receiving the equivalent of 140000 and 10000 shares in 
recruitcosmos a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential 
people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly 
prosecutors say he put pressure on the labor ministry not to 
change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates 
which would have hurt recruits sales of jobplacement magazines 
fujinami denied the allegations 
fujinami said he had been unaware of both the political 
donations from recruit and the sharedealing which was done by an 
aide 
ikeda 52 is charged with receiving 14000 for himself 
35000 for his wife and 5000 shares in recruitcosmos for his 
brother 
according to prosecutors he gave prorecruit speeches in 
parliament in return ikeda resigned his seat fujinami remained in 
parliament but resigned from his party 
ono a 39yearold former company department head who faces two 
counts of giving bribes denied the allegation 
the other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other recruit 
executives 
prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe 
japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or 
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the 
official is in a position to supervise 
recruit offered millions of discount shares in recruitcosmos to 
hundreds of politicians bureaucrats and businessmen before the 
stock was available to the general public 
when it was offered on the overthecounter market the price of 
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits fujinamis 
shares were said to have gained him 215000

the food and drug administration is 
investigating reports that high doses of a generic drug used to 
treat leukemia patients may cause dangerous neurological side 
effects 
the fda said it is considering how to alert physicians to 
reports from the university of wisconsin that high doses of generic 
cytarabine made by quad pharmaceuticals of indianapolis may have 
more serious neurological side effects than are caused by low doses 
of the drug 
the reports were presented to the fdas oncologic drugs advisory 
committee on thursday at an emergency meeting called by the agency 
because of the serious nature of the problem 
stephen rinsler an fda pharmacologist estimated as many as 
3000 leukemia patients may be candidates for highdose cytarabine 
therapy about 30 times the normal dose 
an official said the concerns were not prompted by quads legal 
problems with the agencys generic drug division earlier this 
year the company and a former executive pleaded guilty to charges 
of bribing fda chemists to win approval of generic drug 
applications 
cytarabine is known to have neurological side effects including 
loss of muscular coordination and slurred speech but in high doses 
it appears these side effects may be more prevalent and more 
severe said dr gregory burke acting director of the fdas 
oncology division 
nothing is very definitive burke said its like a flag 
signal 
burke said the action the fda takes to alert physicians to the 
reports will depend on whether quad decides to take similar action 
on its own although he said some action will be taken within the 
week 
quad officials did not return a telephone call for comment late 
in the day thursday 
the fda investigation could not determine whether any patients 
had died as a result of the effects of the quad drug most of the 
patients being treated at the university of wisconsins medical 
center were on a combination of drugs were in advanced stages of 
the disease and could have had other side effects of the 
cytarabine which also suppresses bone marrow and damages the 
liver burke said 
burke said the fda was alerted to the possible problem by the 
university of wisconsin last summer the medical center returned to 
using upjohns brandname cytosar after the side effects of the 
quad product were noticed 
analyses of samples of the brand name and generic drugs found 
they both meet fda standards and neither drug appears to cause an 
unusually large number of neurological problems when used in normal 
doses burke said 
however burke said fda officials are concerned that when used 
in high doses impurities in the quad drug may worsen the side 
effects 
impurities resulting from the manufacturing process are 
different in the two drugs he said at high doses the relative 
amount of impurities could make a difference burke said 
the problem could extend to other drugs when they are used in 
high doses because all drugs contain a certain amount of 
impurities he said 
he noted doctors have found success in high anticancer drug 
dosages and because of that physicians are increasing dosages 
above the level for which the drug was approved in the case of 
cytarabine the high doses were about 30 times the regular dose 
burke said 
the fdas investigation of the wisconsin highdose patients 
found eight of 25 patients on the quad drug experienced 
neurological side effects while three of 34 patients on the upjohn 
drug had these effects rinsler said

irancontra defendant john poindexter says 
former president reagan is trying to avoid political criticism in 
attempting to quash a subpoena for his diaries 
poindexters lawyers challenged both reagan and president bush 
to invoke executive privilege in their attempts to quash defense 
subpoenas for the former presidents diaries and papers 
reagan and the justice department moved to quash the subpoenas 
but on legal grounds other than executive privilege 
obviously their legal position is carefully calculated to 
avoid subjecting them to the political consequences of their 
invoking the privilege including the consequent public perception 
that mr reagan and mr bush are still attempting to hide the true 
facts regarding their involvement in the socalled irancontra 
affair poindexters lawyers said in a court filing 
poindexter who is accused of lying to congressional inquiries 
about his involvement in the armsforhostages deals and covert 
assistance to nicaraguan rebels underscored his desire to call 
reagan as a witness at the trial 
documents produced in response to the defendants subpoena are 
no substitute for mr reagans live testimony indeed that live 
testimony may be essential to the jurys understanding of those 
documents the defense brief said 
poindexters filing in us district court was made in response 
to motions by reagan and the justice department to quash subpoenas 
for documents in the possession of the former president and the 
national archives 
in its brief the justice department told judge harold h greene 
the unique and sensitive nature of the documents sought by 
defendant mandates extreme prudence in fashioning a procedure 
governing their potential disclosure 
poindexter received the judges permission to subpoena the 
documents to try to show that he believed his actions in the 
irancontra affair were legal and authorized by reagan so that he 
would have no motive to lie about them 
if mr reagan or mr bush is concerned about the impact of 
this case upon the prerogatives of the presidency then they should 
invoke executive privilege poindexters lawyers said 
otherwise they are just wasting the courts and the defendants 
time

what was thought to be a raven attacking 
kids at the winona day care center in southeastern minnesota turned 
out to be a crow that seemed to just care a lot about people 
on wednesday a group of preschoolers sang and danced around the 
bird which played tugofwar with sticks and tried to land on 
toddlers heads 
when a crowd of kids goes out on the playground he feels he 
has to come over and play said teacher nancy hoffmaster 
hoffmaster and receptionist debbie stark said the bird also 
liked to pick up pencils and other items which it dropped on cars 
but because the crow scared many of the children it was 
captured later wednesday by security guard art kreisher sr and 
hoffmaster and put into a cage 
kreisher said he plans to free the bird unless it is claimed in 
the next couple of days 
i figure hes got a right to live he really never hurt

the man charged with killing 27 people in 
what police call the nations worst alcoholrelated traffic 
accident publicly apologized for an act he claims to be unable to 
recall 
testifying thursday in front of a chart with the victims 
photographs and names larry mahoney said he had no recollection of 
driving the wrong way on interstate 71 on may 14 1988 and 
colliding with the packed church bus 
its a fact i was involved in an accident but i dont 
remember seeing the bus mahoney said i remember waking up in 
the hospital 
he concluded his 70 minutes on the witness stand by apologizing 
to the survivors and families of those maimed or killed in the 
disaster 
i really am sorry and i mean this mahoney said his voice 
tight with emotion i know its not going to make you feel any 
different toward me 
members of the victims families and mahoneys family broke 
into tears 
behind mahoney was a large seating chart of the church bus that 
carried 67 passengers the names of those killed designated with a 
black letter d 
mahoney faces multiple life sentences if convicted of the 
charges 27 counts of murder 42 counts of wanton endangerment 12 
counts of assault and a count of drunken driving 
defense attorney russell baldani said mahoney was relieved after 
taking the stand 
he didnt have to tell me it was readily apparent 
baldani said 
the trial recessed until monday when both defense and 
prosecution will call rebuttal witnesses 
mahoney a factory worker said he was upset the day of the 
crash over a variety of personal problems his attempts to 
reconcile with his estranged wife janice his declaration of 
bankruptcy because of large medical bills for a daughters health 
problems and attempts thwarted by bad credit to buy a new 
trailer for his family 
mahoney said the problems were not an excuse for his drinking 
and driving 
prosecutor paul richwalsky jr said of mahoneys testimony 
when you compare bankruptcy and how do i get a doublewide 
trailer to the fact that you no longer have a son or a 
daughter or the survivors who will wear the badges of his mistake 
for the rest of their lives it sort of pales in significance 
mahoney described stopping for beer at two bars and a liquor 
store on the saturday afternoon of the crash and drinking with 
friends and while driving to see an exgirlfriend his parents and 
a friend 
he described asking for a beer at a small party after giving a 
friend the keys to his truck no beer was available and a man 
offered him a mixed drink a clear liquid mahoney couldnt identify 
was poured into a glass 
i took a big drink of it and i coughed and choked on it he 
said 
some of the men laughed at his reaction he recalled adding 
that he drank a soft drink to get rid of the taste 
in previous testimony witnesses said the soft drink was mixed 
with vodka but mahoney said he couldnt taste anything in it 
nor did he remember getting the keys to his truck and driving 
away he said 
richwalsky said he had problems with mahoneys selective 
memory 
william summers mahoneys lead attorney said he will attempt 
to introduce evidence about ford motor co next week ford 
manufactured the chassis of the 1977 school bus involved in the 
wreck 
the defense contends that the design of the bus built before 
federal safety standards were tightened contributed to the deaths

the white house says a bipartisan panels 
report on bloody violence at a rally in nicaragua raises the bush 
administrations concerns that the sandinistas dont intend to hold 
a fair election 
members of the panel on thursday gave president bush a firsthand 
account of the bloodletting last weekend that they said was caused 
by sandinista supporters wielding machetes 
democratic and republican members of the delegation met with 
bush for 30 minutes displaying photographs and videotapes of 
people whose arms had been severed at least one person was killed 
in the violence officials have said 
our point was that unless something is changed dramatically 
now people will be afraid to vote in the feb 25 election 
said delegation member bob beckel a political consultant who was 
walter mondales 1984 presidential campaign manager 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the groups 
report only heightens concerns that the sandinistas wont hold 
a fair election as scheduled in february 
fitzwater said the white house gave additional credence to the 
groups report because beckel opposes aid to the usbacked 
contras beckel told reporters although he was disturbed by the 
events he remained opposed to contra aid 
the group said bush agreed to help arrange a meeting with the 
contras in an effort to get a pledge that the rebels wont 
instigate violence during the election 
members of the group said supporters of the leftist government 
violently disrupted a sunday rally held by backers of opposition 
presidential candidate violeta chamorro in the town of masatepe and 
that a sandinista police chief refused entreaties to stop the 
fracas 
cecilia lopez a spokeswoman for the nicaraguan embassy in 
washington called the masatepe violence an isolated incident 
and said the opposition has held more than 50 peaceful rallies 
since campaigning began 
ambassador luigi r einaudi the us representative to the 
organization of american states said thursday that there had seven 
incidents of violence or intimidation since nov 1 when the 
sandinistas lifted their unilaterally declared ceasefire against 
the contra rebels 
despite many fine words about good intentions the reality of 
the violence is preventing the elections from channelling the 
conflict into the political foms that could give nicaraguans hope 
for a more peaceful future einaudi said in a speech to a regular 
session of the oas permanent council 
members of the american group said oas observers missed most of 
the violence and later deliberately downplayed the sandinista 
involvement by saying it was impossible to say who started the 
violence or who played a major role 
the delegation said in its report that observers arrived to find 
a rockthrowing battle involving about 100 people the american 
delegation and two oas observers moved through the crowd urging 
calm 
one of the oas observers told the americans the fracas began 
when opposition supporters were set upon by a small group of 
sandinista backers who taunted them and threw rocks 
after the nearby political rally concluded several bands of 
sandinista youths charged into the crowd with rocks nailstudded 
sticks and machetes the report said 
the observers said they tried to help break up the fracas and 
later sought out the police chief to intervene the police chief 
said he didnt want to intervene because he feared he would be 
accused of interrupting an opposition rally but finally agreed to 
accompany them to the site of the fracas the report said 
the trip by the 15member american delegation was sponsored by 
the nonprofit center for democracy which has sent election 
observers to panama el salvador and the philippines nicaragua 
invited the center to send a team to monitor election preparations

american airline flights will feature taped cnn 
newscasts without pictures of plane crashes after cbs balked at 
the airlines request that it cut such stories from its inflight 
programs 
american did not renew its sixyear contract with the cbs 
morning news and the last program will be shown on the airline 
before feb 28 said david berman a vice president at cbs 
broadcast international 
under americans guidelines he said cbs has pulled entire news 
programs with reports of airline crashes or virtually anything 
detrimental to the airlines 
but cbs refused americans request to delete adverse airline 
news and deliver the remainder of the show he said 
americans rationale may be to avoid alarming passengers but 
its like passing out newspapers with holes cut in them berman 
said thursday 
americans decision to drop cbs was financial and wasnt based 
on an editorial dispute said mary oneill a spokeswoman for the 
airline we didnt feel we were earning enough profit from our 
agreement with cbs she said 
but she said the new cnn arrangement in which video portraying 
airline crashes will be deleted was worked out after americans 
surveys showed that its passengers complained that pictures of 
airline crash scenes disturbed them 
americans new inflight agreement for cable news network 
newscasts is with turner home entertainment a division of ted 
turners atlantabased cable empire that merchandises cnn programs 
and other ventures 
cnn said it hopes to have news programs aboard 144000 american 
flights annually by the end of 1990 its newscasts will begin in 
march with eight domestic flights he declined to disclose the 
value of the contract 
steve chamberlain a vice president of turners merchandising 
division said the americancnn contract is expected to be signed 
next week and editorially is limited to stories about air 
crashes 
there will not be any other wholesale editing of our 
product he said above all we have to preserve the 
journalistic integrity of our network 
chamberlain called the agreement a commonsense approach to 
crashes aboard those jets 
it is unreasonable to expect airline passengers to sit and 
watch a graphic portrayal of an airline tragedy he said 
but ed turner a senior vice president at cnn said as a 
passenger it would probably make me feel better but as a 
journalist it doesnt 
chamberlain said none of the other 10 airlines using cnn have 
asked for edited versions of the news which is recorded from live 
feeds 
oneill in a telephone interview from american headquarters in 
dallas said the agreement wouldnt mean a complete blackout of 
such stories 
what the contract with cnn calls for is that cnn will not show 
the video she said they will talk in the audio portion 
about these kinds of incidents but they will not show the video 
barry sherman chairman of the telecommunications department at 
the university of georgia said the agreement could hurt cnns 
reputation as being free from taint and bias 
what cnn has built its reputation on has been that it has not 
avoided the hard issues theyve never to my knowledge edited 
news content sherman said

conductor michael tilson thomas led the new 
world symphony orchestra one of americas newest orchestras in an 
enlightening debut at the nations most venerable concert showcase 
carnegie hall 
this unique ensemble of young professionals was formed only two 
years ago at a time when orchestras everywhere faced money 
problems 
it bills itself as the only fulltime fullsize training 
orchestra in the country its players are recent college graduates 
ranging from ages 21 to 30 the musicians sign on for no more than 
three years the ensembles alumni already number more than 30 
in short the miamibased new world symphony orchestra is an 
orchestra in perpetual transition 
but that didnt mar thursday nights performance whose diverse 
program ranged from a beethoven symphony to bamboula beach the 
miami bamboula by charles wuorinen 
aside from a botched horn entrance here or a flat flute solo 
there the 80 musicians played with great discipline the biggest 
gaffe of the night was minor tilson thomas premature entrance 
after intermission before the orchestra tuned up 
the still youthful tilson thomas who at age 44 is the new 
worlds artistic director and principal conductor of the london 
symphony orchestra held the playing firmly together 
the concert got off to a jolt with the raucous bamboula 
beach a composition commissioned by the tilson thomas for the 
ensembles inaugural performance in february 1988 
the word bamboula originally a creole dance refers to a 
series of otherwise musically unrelated works of mine which all 
share a certain lightness of spirit the pulitzer prizewinning 
wuorinen explained in the program notes 
it was the first new york performance for the short energetic 
piece whose dissonance is punctuated by the percussion section it 
even included a solo for the steel drum 
the composition sometimes sounded like a ride on a subway train 
but it was a fun trip ending in a smash not a crash 
next was aaron coplaonstrating tremendous discipline after the 
heartpounding finale of bamboula 
the compositions many solos provided a chance to the musicians 
especially the strings and woodwinds to display their skills for 
the most part they seized the opportunity 
tilson thomas also chose an unfamiliar version the complete 
symphonic score rather than the oftenplayed suite from the 1944 
ballet 
some audience members grumbled that they could see why the extra 
10 minutes were cut for others however the additional material 
took the listener into new recesses of the composition especially 
after the shaker variations 
in a bow to traditionalists the program ended with beethovens 
symphony no 7 in a major 
the rhythmic generally whimsical composition provided the 
exuberant tilson thomas with a podium showpiece he conducted it 
without a score jabbing his baton toward the players and giving an 
occasional leap and foot stomp without distracting the listener 
after a standing ovation he returned with members of the 
orchestra who did not have parts in the beethoven for an encore 
wagners prelude to act 3 from lohengrin 
i wouldnt want to end the night without everyone on stage 
he told the audience

the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 9034

trading was inactive because of the expected release later 
friday of monthly us economic figures including trade data for 
october and producer prices and industrial production data for 
november dealers said 
the nikkei slipped shortly after trading began as market 
players who were already worried about the speed of recent rises 
in the index stepped to the sidelines but it recovered later 
after intermittent indexbuying by foreign securities firms the 
dealer said 
indexbuying is a tactic that involves the purchase of at least 
1000 shares in all 225 nikkei issues 
in currency dealings currency rates moved narrowly in inactive 
trading in which market players awaited the us economic data 
said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co 
the dollaryen rate moved very tightly while market players 
were just making position adjustments on the west german mark he 
said 
kanai added that investors in general become reluctant to make 
major moves toward the end of the year to avoid possible risks 
during the christmas and new year holidays

here is a text of andrei d sakharovs final 
public statement a call to create a formal opposition to the 
soviet communist party it was made hours before his death thursday 
to opposition members in the congress of peoples deputies it was 
translated from russian by the associated press 
 
i support the formula of opposition what is opposition first 
we cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the leadership 
is doing now it is leading the country to catastrophe prolonging 
the process of perestroika many years it will leave the country in 
a condition in which everything progressive will be destroyed 
during these years all the plans for transition to a market and 
perestroikatype economy appear to be unrealistic dissatisfaction 
is growing in the country and this dissatisfaction makes the 
revolutionary path of development impossible 
the only possible path of revolutionary development is the 
radicalization of perestroika at the same time we declare 
ourselves an opposition and take the responsibility for the 
solutions we suggest this is another side of the same term 
opposition which is extremely important as well 
at this moment we live in conditions of a deep crisis of trust 
in the party and the leadership this can be eliminated only by 
resolute political measures the exclusion of article 6 of the 
constitution and of the articles in line with article 6 is a 
political move not purely juridicial or organizational this is a 
most significant political act right now in this country and not 
in a year when work over the new text of the constitution will be 
completed then all this will no longer be in doubt we need to 
accelerate the process of perestroika now 
the last thing we need is to make certain the position of our 
interregional group the population of the country puts great hope 
in the group but we began losing the trust of the people 
the last matter i wanted to speak about is whether the political 
strike was a present for rightwing forces and whether an 
opposition group will be one as well i categorically disagree with 
both statements what happened in the past week is the most 
powerful politicalization of the country discussions embrace the 
entire country it is not important whether there were a lot of 
strikes or not they were quite numerous including strikes in the 
don basin vorkuta lvov and many other places but this fact is 
not of principal importance it is important that the people at 
last have found a means to express their will and readiness to 
support us politically and we cannot lose this support the only 
possible response from us is our political position they do not 
need anything else

a district attorney said he will do 
everything he can to keep clarence brandley behind bars despite a 
decision overturning the death row inmates conviction for the 
rapeslaying of a teenager 
montgomery county district attorney peter speers said thursday 
he still believes brandley killed cheryl dee fergeson nine years 
ago and that he will ask the texas court of criminal appeals to 
change its decision 
i believe the opinion is wrong speers said if this 
opinion stands the door will be wide open for convicts to 
manipulate weakwilled witnesses invent witnesses and pervert the 
entire criminal justice system 
brandleys first trial ended with a hung jury an allwhite jury 
from the second trial convicted brandley of raping and strangling 
the 16yearold girl while she was attending a volleyball 
tournament in 1980 at conroe high school where brandley worked as 
a janitor 
the appeals court ruled wednesday that brandley who has been on 
death row for nearly nine years and has had two execution dates 
was the victim of an unfair trial 
brandleys attorneys and supporters claim the investigation and 
prosecution was racially motivated since brandley is black and miss 
fergeson was white 
his attorneys also say theyre confident of acquittal in a third 
trial but doubt there is sufficient evidence to prompt another 
trial 
brandley 38 has said he would welcome a new trial 
speers said he would exhaust all legal avenues including a 
third trial to keep brandley behind bars 
if this result stands it is possible even likely that he 
will have literally gotten away with murder speers said i 
believe this would be a gross miscarriage of justice 
james keeshan the original prosecutor on brandleys case and 
now a district judge in conroe agreed 
i remain convinced based on the evidence i saw that clarence 
brandley murdered cheryl fergeson keeshan said i am concerned 
about what effect this decision will have on future cases where 
orchestrated events years after the trial may result in the 
overturning of convictions 
in the 86page opinion the appeals court said the investigative 
team failed to follow up leads from witnesses failed to take blood 
and hair samples from other janitors who had been brandleys chief 
accusers provided an opportunity for a common account of the 
incident from the janitors threatened witnesses and lost evidence 
from the trial 
three white janitors testified in the first trial that they had 
seen brandley follow miss fergeson to a restroom but when one of 
the men recanted his testimony he was not called to testify in the 
second trial 
speers said he probably will not file a motion with the appeals 
court until next week if the court rejects his request to reverse 
its decision he said he would consider an appeal to the us 
supreme court 
brandleys attorneys are seeking a personal recognizance bond 
for him the appeals court rejected bond wednesday

the judge in the trial of a teenager accused 
of selling federal officials crack cocaine across the street from 
the white house called the government effort to show how easy it is 
to buy drugs was a keystone kops thing 
first the alleged drug dealer didnt show up to make the sale in 
lafayette park drug enforcement administration special agent sam 
gaye testified thursday next the undercover officers body 
microphone malfunctioned then the cameraman videotaping the deal 
missed the action because he was being assaulted by a homeless 
woman 
this is like a keystone kops thing us district judge 
stanley sporkin exclaimed as the government presented evidence 
against alleged drug seller keith jackson 18 whose trial 
continues today 
dea officials set up the sept 1 drug sale to show how easy it 
is to buy illegal drugs even in the shadow of the white house 
president bush used the story of the sale as an illustration during 
his sept 5 nationwide speech about the war on drugs 
jackson is charged with four counts of distributing crack at 
three locations in the nations capital between april 24 and sept 
1 if convicted he faces life in prison without parole 
gaye said his boss asked him aug 31 to set up a drug deal near 
the executive mansion 
he just walked into my office and said can you make a drug 
buy around 1600 pennsylvania avenue gaye testified adding i 
had 24 hours to buy three ounces of crack 
presidential speech writers conceived the idea of having bush 
hold up a bag of crack during his antidrug speech last summer 
while the president was on vacation in kennebunkport maine bush 
endorsed the idea and white house officials called a top aide to 
attorney general dick thornburgh who in turn contacted the dea 
gaye said the first dealer he set up a meeting with didnt show 
then a meeting was arranged with jackson 
the dea officials said that their efforts to get jackson to the 
park almost failed because jackson didnt know where the white 
house was 
gaye also jackson who was supposed to hand the threeounce bag 
of crack to gaye instead gave it to the informer to hand to the 
agent

jennifer casolo received a heros 
welcome and proclaimed she was innocent of hiding munitions in her 
yard in el salvador as she greeted 350 residents who turned out in 
freezing cold to cheer her return 
casolo who said she maintained neutrality while giving visiting 
americans tours of el salvador during four years there said 
thursday night she will speak out against us aid to the 
salvadoran government now that she has been expelled 
casolo arrived in miami on wednesday then flew thursday to new 
york where she fielded questions from reporters at laguardia 
airport before being driven the 75 miles to thomaston in a cadillac 
with sen christopher dodd dconn who had lobbied for her 
release from a salvadoran prison 
casolo embraced her father john casolo and met close friends 
and relatives including her brother john who were waiting for 
her in the town hall of the town of 7000 people 
i want to thank each and every one of you from the bottom of 
my heart for all the prayers and letters john casolo told the 
crowd outside youve really made this the merriest christmas 
weve ever had 
jennifer casolo standing on a flatbed truck draped in red 
white and blue bunting wished the crowd feliz navidad and 
when a sound system failure forced her to use a big megaphone 
joked about her days as a cheerleader at thomaston high school 
she left el salvador wednesday after a judge dropped terrorism 
charges against her for lack of evidence and ordered her deported 
casolo who worked in el salvador for the christian educational 
seminars since 1985 was arrested nov 26 after authorities raided 
her rented house and unearthed dynamite grenades and more than 
20000 rounds of ammunition from the garden 
she said her tribulations were minor compared to those of the 
salvadoran people 70000 of whom have died in a decadelong civil 
war but the disrespect with which us authorities dealt with her 
case demonstrated their cynicism toward el salvadors people she 
said 
its shameful its disgraceful she said in new york how 
can the bush administration say theyre working to create a just 
society in el salvador when they cant even treat an american 
citizen with the rights of a just society 
i tried to convey to the salvadoran police that a person is 
innocent until provent guilty but i didnt know that american 
officials werent giving me that right 
bush administration officials did not press for her release and 
had said they thought she was probably guilty 
casolo said she had a great love for the salvadoran people and 
would not feel free until all political prisoners were released 
there 
the salvadorans deserve a country where they can eat where 
their children can go to school where they dont have to worry 
about being dragged away in the middle of the night casolo said 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani said he was convinced of 
her guilt despite her release asked about that thursday night 
casolo said simply im innocent 
she went on maybe those weapons were there maybe a 
salvadoran guerrilla tipped them off but theres just as much 
possibility that they beat the hell out of someone to get them to 
say it and excuse my language 
of the weapons cache she said i dont know if it was there 
if they put it there or if someone else put it there and i dont 
think ill ever know 
casolo urged an end to us military aid to el salvador 
for four years i worked in el salvador during that time i 
kept my mouth shut she said its time for me to talk so that 
others better understand what has happened 
after the official homecoming at town hall casolo headed for a 
private reunion with her mother audrey casolo who did not attend 
the welcome ceremony because she wanted to greet her daughter 
privately

the imprisonment of a former black civil 
rights activist resulted from racial polarization in the state 
gary tylers lawyer said after a racially split vote by a pardon 
board to reduce his sentence 
the board voted 32 thursday to recommend that gov buddy roemer 
reduce the life sentence for tyler who at 16 was condemned to die 
for the 1974 slaying of a white student during a racial 
confrontation 
the death sentence was automatically changed to life when the 
us supreme court overturned louisianas old death penalty law in 
1976 
tylers conviction has withstood all appeals but the vote would 
make him eligible for parole in five years roemer will make a 
decision within a few weeks his aides said 
parole eligibility isnt the same as freedom for tyler 31 
whose entire adult life has been spent in the state prison at 
angola said attorney mary howell 
if gary was white we wouldnt be here today she told 
reporters after the pardon board meeting we still dont see the 
kind of justice we want in this state 
the vote three black members for reduction in sentence and two 
whites against is representative of racial polarization said 
howell 
its pretty amazing she said in 1985 in ascension parish 
a white kid shot to death an unarmed black kid at a school and was 
indicted for manslaughter he was placed on probation and told to 
finish his education and pay the funeral costs of the victim 
and then we have gary tyler a black kid who police said had 
a smart mouth 
amnesty international and other human rights organizations have 
urged freedom for tyler as have more than 12000 people who signed 
petitions to the pardon board the british reggae band ub40 
recorded a song about tyler and he was described by the soviet 
communist party newspaper pravda in 1978 as a political prisoner 
tylers mother juanita tyler said she was happy with the 
decision but believes board members would have voted for an 
immediate release had they interviewed him board members routinely 
do not interview inmates unless they are facing death 
tyler was active in a school desegregation battle in october 
1974 that drew the ku klux klan and state police to destrehan a 
small town on the mississippi river 25 miles north of new orleans 
one day whites surrounded buses of black students at destrehan 
high school shouting and hurling bottles cans and rocks a shot 
was fired from one of the buses timothy weber a white student 
standing with his mother across the schoolyard fell dead 
witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand tyler was 
the only one on the bus wearing gloves said police 
those who believe tyler was framed say that a student who 
testified against him was known as a liar and that police planted a 
pistol found in the stuffing of the torn seat where tyler had sat

opposition leader patricio aylwin told 
his jubilant supporters today that chileans have regained their 
freedom by electing him president ending the dark era of military 
rule under gen augusto pinochet 
chileans danced waved national flags and set off fireworks to 
celebrate aylwins landslide victory thursday over hernan buchi a 
progovernment candidate celebrations lasted into the morning in 
santiago and cities nationwide 
the election was intended to bring back democracy to the last 
south american country still ruled by the military 
pinochet was forced to call the election after losing a 
referendum in october last year in which voters rejected a 
military proposal that he remain as president until 1997 
speaking to hundreds of supporters early today from the 
thirdfloor balcony of a downtown hotel aylwin referred to the 
generations of democracy enjoyed by chileans until pinochet 
overthrew elected president salvador allende in a bloody 1973 coup 
chile has refound her history chile has regained liberty 
chile has regained democracy said aylwin who promised a 
government of national unity to repair the political and social 
divisions under the pinochet regime 
pinochets government officially recognized aylwins triumph 
interior minister carlos caceres said in a nationally broadcast 
address that authorities would abide by it 
official results from 93 percent of all polling stations in 
thursdays election gave aylwin 3577669 votes or 552 percent of 
all valid ballots he was supported by a coalition of 17 parties 
ranging from right to left 
buchi pinochets former finance minister and architect of a 
free market economy had 1901668 votes or 294 percent a third 
candidate populist businessman francisco errazuriz had 998786 
votes 15 percent 
buchi and errazuriz visited aylwin to congratulate him on his 
victory 
his absolute majority and 21 advantage over his nearest 
progovernment challenger appeared to give him the mandate for a 
possible upper hand in future relations with pinochet who has 
vowed to remain on as army commander 
aylwin 71 a christian democrat and former senate president is 
to begin a fouryear term on march 11 when pinochets term ends 
much of his future authority was expected to depend however on 
results from thursdays voting for the 38 elected senate seats and 
120 house of deputies seats up to 10 more senators are to be 
designated by the supreme court national security council and 
other government bodies 
conclusive returns in the congressional races were not expected 
until later today however there were indications from 
preliminary unofficial returns that the progovernment forces may 
have fared better in the congressional vote than in the 
presidential race 
from the moment aylwins victory became evident supporters took 
to the streets dancing and chanting or roaming in noisy caravans 
of buses trucks and automobiles they waved chilean flags and 
party banners blowing on horns and shooting off fireworks 
similar celebrations were reported in other large cities and in 
the pacific resort city of vina del mar national police used water 
cannons to clear the streets 
demonstrations are legally banned on election day police in 
santiago who had blocked many antipinochet protests and fired 
water cannons and tear gas at demonstrators in the past did not 
intefere with the celebrations and even suspended traffic on the 
citys main boulevard to allow aylwin supporters to listen to their 
leaders victory speech 
its forbidden said a police lieutenant at the scene but 
theres no problem 
ending his speech aylwin urged the demonstrators to return 
peacefully and to attend a celebration rally tonight 
pinochet in a bref conversation with reporters said he was not 
disturbed by aylwins victory they were better organized they 
know how to do things he said 
the election was peaceful with voters arriving early at the 
polls and waiting patiently in long lines sometimes for hours to 
cast their ballots nearly all 75 million elegible voters cast 
their votes 
caceres said chileans should take pride on the peaceful manner 
the election took place and for the high turnout and praised the 
armed forces for maintaining order 
aylwin lauded the maturity of the population and also said 
the armed forces deserved praise for carrying out a clean election

researchers say physicians fail to 
diagnose severe depression in half the patients who suffer the most 
common mental illness and the problem is worse in prepaid health 
plans 
depression is quite serious its eminently treatable and yet 
were finding only half of patients are detected by doctors who 
are paid fees based on how much care they provide patients said 
dr kenneth wells the studys chief author 
only twofifths of depressed patients were recognized by general 
practitioners internists and other nonmental health specialists 
who were paid fixed fees in advance regardless of how much care 
they provided he added 
such doctors include those working for health maintenance 
organizations or hmos and also physicians who provide prepaid 
care in solo and group practices 
the study published in todays journal of the american medical 
association involved 650 severely depressed patients and more than 
500 doctors in los angeles chicago and boston it was conducted by 
researchers from the rand corp in santa monica the university of 
california los angeles and new england medical center hospitals 
in boston 
compared with general medical doctors frequent failure to 
detect depression psychiatrists and psychologists recognized more 
than 83 percent of seriously depressed patients the researchers 
found 
such mental health specialists were equally likely to detect and 
treat depressed people regardless of how they were paid said 
wells a ucla psychiatrist and senior researcher at rand 
i know depression is missed said dr charles mcelwee 
president of the los angeles county medical association all 
doctors have to be on the lookout for the depressed patient this 
study will help raise everybodys level of awareness 
stuart byer president of the california association of hmos 
said he couldnt explain why prepaid doctors were less likely than 
others to recognize depression 
but he said other studies show doctors in hmos which were 
established to control spiraling medical costs deliver better 
care by not overprescribing drugs procedures and hospitalization 
although everyone feels sad at times 94 million americans 
suffer clinical depression during any sixmonth period according 
to the american psychiatric association which calls depression 
the most common and treatable of all mental illnesses 
one in four women and one in 10 men can expect to develop it 
during their lifetime between 80 percent and 90 percent of those 
who suffer depression can be effectively treated by medication or 
psychotherapy an apa pamphlet said 
each year depression spurs 20000 suicides and costs 16 
billion in lost productivity and medical expenses in the united 
states a 1985 study found 
wells said depressed patients in his study felt sad all the 
time every day for at least two weeks and also had at least three 
other symptoms of depression such as poor sleep or appetite 
suicidal thoughts difficulty concentrating having no interest in 
things you normally enjoy 
the researchers evaluated 22462 patients who visited doctors 
regularly using detailed diagnostic interviews to pick a 
representative sample of 650 severely depressed people 
studies in individual hospitals or clinics previously found 
doctors often dont recognize depression wells said his study is 
easily the largest and the first to cover all major types of 
medical practice 
he found general medical doctors paid on a feeforservice basis 
detected only 54 percent of depressed patients and prepaid doctors 
recognized only 42 percent of such people 
wells speculated some doctors view treatment of depression as 
optional because some patients get well without help prepaid plans 
are meant to save money so doctors working for such plans may be 
even less likely than others to watch for signs of depression he 
said 
hmo doctors are not encouraged to underserve patients byer 
said doctors are encouraged to deliver the right care

an increasingly radical and disillusioned andrei 
d sakharov fought until the end to keep the soviet union on the 
path of reform started by president mikhail s gorbachev 
he died late thursday while writing a speech to the soviet 
congress demanding the communists constitutional guarantee to 
power be revoked his family said his last words to them were 
tomorrow there will be a battle 
hours earlier sakharov made an uncompromising if not eloquent 
appeal to create a formal political opposition to the communist 
party and to build a multiparty democracy 
we cannot take on ourselves responsibility for what the 
leadership is doing now sakharov told the interregional group 
it is leading the country to catastrophe prolonging the process 
of perestroika many years 
sakharovs highpitched voice rambling style and stammer made 
him a poor public speaker and despite the groups respect for him 
the hum of other conversations in the hall increased as sakharov 
spoke 
sakharov spent his last several days working in the seat of 
soviet power where until just a few short years ago he was 
roundly and regularly condemned 
having supported gorbachevs reforms in 1987 after the soviet 
leader brought him back from internal exile sakharov had taken an 
increasingly critical view recently that brought him into conflict 
with his president 
he and other radicals had called for a twohour general strike 
monday to press for elimination of article 6 of the soviet 
constitution which makes the communist party the leading and 
guiding force of soviet society and the nucleus of its political 
system 
his last exchange with gorbachev shown on live television 
several hours after the opening of the congress winter session on 
tuesday was a bitter one 
having cut off another deputy who wished to take the podium 
gorbachev invited sakharov to address the 2250member congress 
sakharov urged the congress to strike all the articles 
hindering the passing of laws on land property and other bills 
promoting perestroika 
when he began to speak about the partys monopoly on power 
gorbachev halted him with a curt thank you 
i am under the impression that neither you nor we will know 
how to realize your suggestion gorbachev said who is to 
define what articles to exclude 
when sakharov turned to gorbachev and handed him a stack of 
telegrams in support of his position the soviet leader retorted 
you come to me i will give you three files of telegrams 
undaunted sakharov continued to press the issue 
sakharov was elected one of five leaders of the interregional 
deputies group when it was formed in august and he recently had 
become one of its more radical and outspoken members 
dressed in a brown suit he sat at the end of the head table 
his chair pushed back and forehead in hand at the groups meeting 
thursday with him at the table were the groups other leaders 
historian yuri afanasyev communist maverick boris n yeltsin and 
economists gavriil popov and viktor palm 
the general strike he pressed for on monday failed and that 
tactic was widely criticized by interregional deputies thursday 
one deputy said the strike call was present no 1 to the 
conservatives controlling the congress and that the formation of a 
political opposition would be present no 2 
historian roy medvedev a longtime acquaintance who also serves 
in the congress of peoples deputies said in an interview that 
thursday had been a difficult day for sakharov 
he wasnt a politician and didnt always realize the 
consequences of his actions but he never gave in to 
circumstances medvedev said

thousands of elderly people fall and fracture 
their hips because they take longlasting sleeping pills mainly 
valium librium and dalmane instead of shorteracting drugs a 
researcher says 
the longacting drugs are no more effective than related 
shorteracting drugs but the longacting drugs were developed 
first and some doctors still are prescribing them to the elderly 
said epidemiologist wayne a ray 
ray is coauthor of a study published in todays edition of the 
journal of the american medical association that found people over 
65 who took the longlasting benzodiazepine drugs were 70 percent 
more likely to sustain hip fractures than those who took no such 
drugs 
but shorteracting benzodiazepines carried no higher risk the 
study said 
hip fracture is a serious injury ray said 
he noted that about 250000 elderly people fall and break their 
hips annually in the united states resulting in monetary costs of 
6 billion 
the human costs are even higher ray said a 20 percent 
increased death rate in the year after the fracture a loss of 
ability to walk unassisted among up to half the victims and entry 
into nursing homes among up to a third of victims 
hip fractures mark the beginning of the end for many elderly 
people ray an associate professor of preventive medicine at 
vanderbilt university school of medicine in nashville said in a 
telephone interview thursday 
he estimated that 10 percent to 15 percent of people over 65 
take benzodiazepine drugs the most commonly prescribed 
tranquilizers and sleeping pills because of their effectiveness and 
relative safety 
all have the side effects of reducing coordination and 
alertness ray said but longacting benzodiazepines require days 
to be eliminated while shorteracting ones are largely eliminated 
in hours 
he estimated thousands of hip fractures could be prevented each 
year if older people stopped using the longacting drugs 
rays team studied all the hip fractures reported among people 
65 and older between 1977 and 1985 in saskatchewan canada an area 
chosen because its healthcare system has unusually complete 
records 
the researchers compared use of benzodiazepine tranquilizers and 
sleeping pills among 4501 victims of hip fracture and a control 
group of 24041 canadians matched for comparison 
ray said patients should be encouraged to seek nondrug 
alternatives that will help them relax or sleep such as reducing 
caffeine intake getting more exercise and going to bed later 
three drugs accounted for 95 percent of the longacting 
medications taken by study subjects diazepam marketed as valium 
flurazepam marketed as dalmane and chlordiazepoxide marketed as 
librium all are manufactured by roche laboratories of nutley nj 
nancy mattison a spokeswoman for roche said thursday its 
been generally recognized that there are some adverse effects like 
this on the elderly 
but side effects of the shortacting drugs are less wellknown 
and less predictable than those of longeracting ones she said 
research needs to be completed to identify geriatric patients 
that may be at highest risk of hip fracture at the same time as 
taking benzodiazepines ms mattison said 
shortacting benzodiazepines that accounted for 95 percent of 
those taken by subjects in the study were triazolam marketed as 
halcion by the upjohn co of kalamazoo mich oxazepam marketed 
as serax by wyethayerst laboratories of phildelphia and 
lorazepam marketed as ativan by wyethayerst

a former prostitute who accused the priest who 
founded a runaway shelter of financial and sexual improprieties is 
welcome to come back in off the streets the rev bruce ritter said 
after denying the charges 
if he came back today we would welcome him back to convenant 
house ritter said at a news conference thursday there are 
many people here who care very deeply about him 
prosecutor robert morgenthau confirmed wednesday he was 
investigating the mans charges of financial improprieties by 
ritter the 20yearold former covenant house resident also 
reportedly claimed he had a sexual relationship with the franciscan 
priest 
i categorically deny these allegations ritter said they 
are simply nonsense 
ritter and the authorities have not publicly identified the man 
but a law enforcement source identified him as timothy warner 
ritter said the charges were deeply offensive to me and had 
seriously harmed the image of the charitable organization an 
audit he said found our books in perfect order every penny is 
accounted for 
ritter founded covenant house for homeless teenagers in 1969 
and has built it into an 85 millionayear operation with seven 
shelters in the united states one in toronto and four in latin 
america more than 90 percent of its funding is private 
covenant house directly serves about 25000 children annually 
and its national telephone line gets about a million calls for help 
a year 
ritter said the young man came to the agency early this year 
saying he was a runaway prostitute being pursued by organized crime 
covenant house in manhattan currently has about 150 other 
runaways in similar straits he said they are given special 
attention and a personal mentor 
i chose to become his mentor because frankly i had more 
experience than anyone else he said 
staff members took the man to their homes on special occasions 
and ritter acknowledged traveling with him on a few occasions but 
said there were no sexual relations 
the man was enrolled at manhattan college but eventually 
dropped out and lapsed back into prostitution 
ritter blamed himself for not spending enough time with the 
young man 
we tried so very hard and we failed he said it is 
probably better to say that i failed i thought i knew more 
than i did 
asked why the man would have accused him of such transgressions 
ritter replied i honestly simply do not know 
he said he last spoke with the man in early november telling 
him to either go back to college or get a job the man refused 
either option and left the apartment covenant house had provided 
him on dec 5 he said 
the priest said he was most concerned that supporters have had 
their faith in me shattered and would not be willing to continue 
their aid 
ritter who has pursued a vigorous travel schedule in recent 
years despite a bout with cancer calls covenant house an 
intensive care unit for dying children 
we help about onethird of the kids that come in he said in 
an interview last year we lose the rest

toyota motor sales usa inc and toyota corp will 
ask a judge to set aside a 432 million judgment for a woman whose 
husband and two daughters burned to death in a 1982 car fire 
officials said 
jurors in a state district court awarded 182 million in actual 
damages and 25 million in exemplary damages the largest ever 
against toyota to nike adegbite 36 who watched as her family 
and two others were killed in the fire 
douglas west vice president and general counsel for toyota 
motors in torrance calif said the company was surprised and 
disappointed by wednesdays verdict and will ask for a new trial 
if the judge refuses toyota will appeal the judgment west said 
mrs adegbite escaped with only minor burns and cuts from the 
1973 toyota corona station wagon when it caught fire after being 
rearended by a van 
her husband adeyemi 35 and her daughters yetunde 7 and 
adeloa 8 months were killed the vans driver boyo adetoye 
received minor injuries but his wife and child were killed 
mrs adegbites attorney stan pfeiffer said the lawsuit 
claimed toyota was negligent in its design of the station wagon and 
failed to recall it the trial lasted six weeks 
the attorney said mrs adegbite and her family were in the back 
seat of the station wagon when it was struck on a houston highway 
sept 26 1982 the vans impact pushed the station wagons 
gasoline tank forward pfeiffer said and the tank was punctured by 
an empty spare tire carrier and a valve on the rear axle 
adetoye was not involved in the case because he had reached a 
settlement on a similar lawsuit about a year ago pfeiffer said 
the settlement amount was not disclosed 
west said toyota has never had any other claims against the 
design of the vehicle he added the company denies any defects or 
negligence in the vehicles design 
lawyers on both sides expressed surprise at the size of the 
judgment 
we were of course surprised at the verdict not only by the 
extraordinary amount but that the jury decided against us west 
said 
previously the largest award against toyota was about 5 
million he said 
ms adegbite was surprised too said pfeiffer 
i think everybody was it was an emotional moment he said

patients and their families are launching their own drives to 
find bone marrow donors although they have only a slight chance of 
finding a stranger with the same tissue type 
the extraordinary efforts are being undertaken because the 
nations bone marrow registry of tissuetyped volunteers is growing 
yet lags painfully behind demand experts say 
elaine chin of naperville ill is asking members of chicagos 
asian community to be tested in hopes of finding a donor for her 
son ray jr 20 a leukemia victim on sunday tests were 
performed on 117 people at a cost to the family of 75 per person 
or 8775 results are expected in a few days 
its not for my son only mrs chin said every person i 
recruit goes into the national donor program 
the problem her son and others face is that on average 
patients who are not lucky enough to have a relative with the same 
tissue type have only a onein20000 chance of finding a stranger 
with the same type and chances are even worse for ethnic 
minorities and people with rare tissue types 
by comparison there are basically only four blood types making 
the matching of blood donors and recipients relatively easy 
the only way to solve that problem is to have more marrow 
donors said dr don thomas of the fred hutchinson cancer 
research center in seattle 
bone marrow is the source of red and white blood cells plus 
platelets required for clotting it can be destroyed by disease or 
as a side effect of treatment for cancer 
more than 20000 bone marrow transplants were performed 
worldwide on leukemia victims and other patients through 1987 the 
last year for which figures are available said dr mortimer 
bortin he is scientific director of the international bone marrow 
transplant registry a research group at the medical college of 
wisconsin in milwaukee 
about 98 percent were matches between siblings of identical 
tissue type bortin said 
two years ago today thomas performed the first transplant 
arranged through the federally funded national marrow donor program 
the bone marrow was removed from a 49yearold medical secretary 
from milwaukee on dec 15 1987 sent to the hutchinson center and 
injected the next day into leukemia patient brooke ward of raleigh 
nc 
even though it was a socalled perfect tissue match there was 
still enough of a difference that brooke now 8 has since suffered 
several bouts of graftvshost disease in which white blood cells 
from the transplanted marrow attack the host body according to her 
mother marguriete ward 
i didnt think wed still be battling it two years down the 
road mrs ward said in a telephone interview wednesday still 
she said we had no other choice it was either that or death i 
would take this any day 
she said doctors have told her the problem could lessen over 
time 
the national marrow donor program located in st paul minn 
currently lists about 70000 potential donors for those without 
compatible siblings said spokeswoman liz quam that includes 3400 
from the netherlands which merged its program with the american 
registry last spring 
even with that number of potential donors only about 10 percent 
of those who consult the national registry are matched and 
transplanted said dr paul mccurdy the programs project officer 
for the national heart lung and blood institute 
englands bone marrow registry the worlds largest with 130000 
names also has a reciprocal sharing arrangement with the united 
states as do france canada israel and australia other western 
european countries and japan are expected to follow suit within six 
months 
getting peoples tissue type determined so that their names can 
be entered in the registry takes only a blood test but for those 
volunteers who are found to match the type of someone needing a 
transfusion the actual donation of bone marrow requires general 
anaesthesia and up to a 48hour hospital stay the marrow is 
removed by means of a needle inserted into the pelvic bone 
the government originally intended to have 100000 potential 
donors by the third year of the registry launched sept 1 1987 
said mccurdy 
that target now is thought to be low 
how many people would you have to have in a registry to assure 
everyone would have a donor its not known said the university 
of pittsburghs dr richard shadduck director of the pittsburgh 
cancer institutes adult bone marrow transplant program

hundreds of troops were rushed to a 
major southern city amid reports today that rebel soldiers plan new 
attacks against president corazon aquino 
also today the nations leading cleric delivered an unusually 
strong attack on inefficiency and nepotism in the aquino 
government which has been deeply shaken by the failed coup that 
was launched dec 1 
prices tumbled in early trading on the manila stock exchange 
until the governments social security system and other 
institutional investors intervened to prevent a feared collapse 
traders attributed the panic selling to thursdays grenade 
attack on an american housing and recreational compound there were 
no injuries and minor damage but the incident raised fears of 
terrorism by remnants of military mutineers who tried to topple 
mrs aquino 
the exchanges composite index of 25 selected issues plunged 
5973 points to close at 100281 down 562 percent from 
thursdays finish before the rally exchange president gerardo 
urban warned the market was collapsing and it has lost its 
sanity 
business sources have expressed concern that the aquino 
government will be unable to cope with the economic political and 
social effects of the failed coup 
in davao 560 miles south of here brig gen mariano baccay 
said 500 marines were flown to the city early today from zamboanga 
to secure the airport banks and other key installations following 
reports of rebel troop movements 
baccay told reporters that an unknown number of rebels had left 
their garrison about 150 miles north of davao but it was 
uncertain where they were heading roadblocks had been set up near 
davao the largest city on mindanao island 
on thursday sen aquilino pimentel who comes from mindanao 
warned of a possible coup attempt on the island in the next two 
weeks rodolfo canieso chief of the government intelligence 
service told a senate committee that rebels were planning a new 
strike against the aquino administration in the central visayas 
islands and mindanao 
canieso a retired major general and former army commander said 
60 percent of the 160000member armed forces would accept whatever 
government emerged victorious in a future coup 
in manila cardinal jaime l sin roman catholic archbishop of 
manila called for stern punishment for mutineers but criticized 
the aquino administration for its stewardship of the nation 
the perpetrators of the coup must definitely be hunted down 
and punished sin told a conference of filipino ambassadors 
but beyond that the presidency must be freed of every taint of 
nepotism the fruits of economic recovery must be distributed more 
equitably 
sin has been among mrs aquinos most outspoken supporters since 
the 1986 people power uprising when he called hundreds of 
thousands into the streets to join the revolution that toppled the 
late president ferdinand marcos and put mrs aquino in power 
during the speech sin said the country appeared quiet for the 
moment like the silence in the eye of a typhoon 
unsettling is the actual inefficiency in many branches of 
government sin said unsettling are the unceasing reports of 
the undue influence of presidential relatives in official 
government policy unsettling is the omnipresence still of so 
much poverty so much suffering in our country 
no group claimed responsibility for the grenade attack on the 
us seafront compound but brig gen alexander aguirre chief of 
the police capital command said the attackers could have been 
rebel soldiers angry at us support for mrs aquino 
the incident followed threats against us interests by rebel 
soldiers after us f4 phantom jets flew air cover for government 
forces during the coup attempt which ended saturday at least 113 
people were killed in the eightday coup 
half of the estimated 3000 troops who took part in the coup 
attempt the sixth and most serious insurrection of mrs aquinos 
regime

a fire that killed four retirement home 
residents the fifth blaze in six months at a virginia nursing or 
retirement home renewed a call for a study of fire safety in the 
states housing for the elderly 
the fire thursday at shenandoah homes retirement community was 
the third fatal fire there in 13 years it injured 23 people but 
residents rescue workers and tv cameramen ushered others to safety 
in earlymorning cold 
a preliminary report on the cause of the fire probably would be 
released today said capt mark light of the roanoke county fire 
and rescue department 
after an oct 5 fire killed 12 residents of a nursing home in 
norfolk state sen stanley walker dnorfolk drafted the bill 
calling for the firesafety study lawmakers will consider it next 
year 
its sad that it takes a tragedy to get people to move 
walker said thursday 
the fire broke out shortly after 2 am in a thirdfloor 
apartment at shenandoah homes 
only the second floor of the sixstory building is licensed as a 
home for adults and regulated by the state the remaining floors 
are considered a boarding home because residents require less 
medical care than in adult homes and nursing homes state officials 
said 
residents many wearing only pajamas streamed out of exits into 
the 19degree cold some were aided by wheelchairs and walkers and 
others were helped by fellow residents rescue personnel and even 
tv cameramen 
i left my walker got my cane and everybody helped each other 
get out said marjorie branson 78 wrapped in a blanket 
it was just a marvel how these elderly people reacted under 
pressure said ottis burgher administrator of the 190occupant 
facility 
in 1976 a fire killed four residents of the shenandoah home 
three months earlier a blaze started by a dropped cigarette killed 
a woman 
fires struck a nursing home in albemarle county on dec 6 a 
retirement home in charlottesville on oct 25 and a nursing home in 
chesapeake on june 30 the fires prompted evacuations but caused no

the two candidates vying to become 
brazils first popularly elected president in nearly three decades 
traded barbs and insults in a crucial nationwide debate 
the 2hour showdown between fernando collor de mello a 
centerright former governor and leftist luis inacio lula da silva 
comes in the stretch drive of sundays election new polls show 
that da silva has erased a 15point deficit in the last two weeks 
to make the race almost dead even 
both candidates ducked questions about inflation expected to 
rise 50 percent in december alone instead they traded personal 
barbs during the debate that began thursday and ended early today 
collor de mello shouting and shaking his fists in the air at 
times called his socialist rival intolerant and backward 
and said the election of da silva would prompt nationwide strikes 
and economic chaos 
da silva labeled collor de mello as emotionally unstable and 
a member of the archaic upper class 
da silva 44 a congressman of the workers party and former 
labor leader instead focused on issues such as redistribution of 
land and wealth and statefunded health care and educational 
reforms 
da silva said if elected he would suspend payments on brazils 
110 billion foreign debt the third worlds largest and invest 
the money for social programs 
brazil paid 14 billion last year servicing its foreign debt 
according to the central bank 
collor de mello 40 the scion of a wealthy political clan and 
former governor of the tiny northeastern state of alagoas said a 
debt moratorium would hurt foreign investment and stunt economic 
growth 
instead the national reconstruction party candidate favored 
cuts in state spending and supported making several staterun 
companies private 
the idea of turning our backs on our debt is flawed collor 
de mello said the present government has already stopped 
payments and where has it gotten us 
brazil has effectively halted all interest payments on its 
commercial debt since september 
da silva called land reform and housing programs essential for 
development in brazil 
he said his government would donate plots of land to homeless 
families in cities and subsidize the construction of homes he did 
not specify how the government strapped with an enormous internal 
debt and the burden of paying a bloated government staff would 
pay for these projects 
collor de mello proposed offering incentives to private 
developers to ease the housing cruch 
on sunday an estimated 82 million voters will go to the polls 
to choose brazils first popularly elected president since 1960 
analysts say the election rides on how well each candidate 
portrays himself as the defender of the poor who make up a 
majority of the electorate 
collor de mellos promises to clean up corrupt government and 
sharp attacks on discredited president jose sarney have been 
popular with poor brazilians and gave him a plurality but not the 
required majority in elections last month 
in the last two weeks opinion polls say da silva has closed the 
gap rapidly in part because of a strong performance in the 
candidates first nationwide debate dec 3 
the last popular election for president was in 1960 when janio 
quadros was elected in 1964 the armed forces took power in a coup 
and ruled the country until 1985 
sarney a civilian was chosen in an electoral college vote 
coordinated by the countrys top generals

a man his adopted teenage daughter and 
her friend succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning as they waited in 
a car for a school bus that passed without stopping to help them 
authorities said 
james richard mcclain 42 had driven his daughter misty 15 
and her friend billy payne 16 to a bus stop thursday to wait for 
the regular 7 am bus barbour county sheriff guy steerman said 
all three apparently had lost consciousness by the time the bus 
stopped on us 119 and moved on at 722 am steerman said 
jeff maxson owner of maxsons salvage a service station where 
the car was parked said the 1977 pontiac station wagon was 
steamed up and covered with a thin layer of snow when he and a 
coworker found the bodies at about 8 am as they opened for 
business 
it was pretty cold and they lived up the hollow and he 
mcclain just brought them down for the bus as he did every day 
steerman said they usually had to wait about seven or eight 
minutes but the bus got hung up on a secondary road by the snow 
and the slick roads and it was late approximately 20 minutes 
steerman and maxson said those aboard the school bus apparently 
did not aid the three even though they waited in the same car every 
day at the service station 
they was supposed to stop and look but the car was steamed up 
so bad they couldnt see in it maxson said 
i thought he was asleep maxson said i beat on the 
windows and tried to get them awake i shoved the guy and he 
wouldnt wake up i hollered at him and called him by name 
steerman said he believed the fatal fumes came from a rusted 
exhaust pipe 
misty mcclain had been adopted earlier this year authorities 
said 
steerman said authorities were pretty sure the deaths were 
caused by carbon monoxide poisoning and did not know whether an 
autopsy was planned

an alleged colombian cocaine dealer has been 
extradited to the united states to face prosecution in connection 
with the importation of more than 100 kilograms of cocaine the 
us marshals service says 
nelson cuevas ramirez 55 who was indicted on drug charges by a 
federal grand jury in manhattan in october was turned over by 
colombia authorities at 7 pm est thursday in bogota marshals 
service director k michael moore announced in a statement released 
here early today 
ramirez was immediately flown to the united states arriving in 
new york city at 415 am est moore said 
ramirez is the tenth person to be extradited from columbia since 
august when barco began a new drive against drug trafficking and 
the first since a massive truck bomb exploded in front of the 
offices of bogotas federal investigative police dec 6 killing at 
least 35 people and wounding hundreds 
us marshal romolo j imundi of the southern district of new 
york said ramirez was in custody pending arraignment in us 
district court in manhattan ramirez exact whereabouts were 
withheld for his protection 
the federal indictment accuses ramirez of conspiracy to import 
and distribute about 150 kilograms of cocaine and the importation 
and possession with intent to distribute 111 kilograms of cocaine 
negotiations for the cocaine allegedly occurred in panama and 
the 111 kilograms were seized in april 1987 at the westchester 
county airport in new york moore said 
president virgilio barco and the government of colombia are 
again to be applauded for their continued courage and resolve in 
standing up to the narcoterrorists through these continued 
extraditions moore said 
according to the drug enforcement administration as many as 300 
colombians already are under indictment in various us cities on 
drugrelated charges although many of the indictments are sealed

tests to detect cocaine use should be done on 
hair samples as well as urine samples because a hair analysis will 
detect drug abuse months afterward a study published today says 
but an editorial accompanying the study in the journal of the 
american medical association said hair analysis is unreliable and 
unwieldy 
the study said hair sampling cannot completely replace urine 
testing since it wont detect cocaine use in the recent few 
days as urinalysis does but hair analysis can uncover whether 
someone has long used drugs 
while a urine test may be negative this hair test will make 
it very difficult to hide a history of drug use dr gideon 
koren an author of the study said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
koren and colleagues at the hospital for sick children in 
toronto did an analysis in 1987 of urine and hair samples from 21 
healthy adults who reported no cocaine use 
they compared results of the test with an analysis of urine and 
hair samples from seven pregnant admitted cocaine users who got 
prenatal counseling at the motherisk clinic in toronto and nine 
cocaine addicts from the medical ward at the addiction research 
foundation in toronto 
urine samples from the groups tested negative 
hair tests for the users some of whom participated in a 
treatment program and had quit reflected that they had once used 
the drug but later had quit koren said 
if an adult chooses to stop taking the drug several days 
before the urine test and chooses to tell you that he didnt 
use the drug there is no way you can tell said koren an 
author of the study but there is one place in the body where 
cocaine gets in and does not know how to get out and thats the 
hair 
in the editorial however dr david n bailey of the university 
of california school of medicine said hair analysis is unwieldy 
for use by most laboratories other than research laboratories 
he questioned the reliability of hair analysis saying dyeing or 
bleaching hair could taint test results as could exposure to 
automobile exhaust fumes or other substances that might cause the 
drugs to deteriorate 
while at first glance this practice may seem to be an 
efficacious one it likely will not become standard for some time 
if at all he said 
koren said he has heard that hair analysis is being used on the 
west coast of the united states by a firm which does testing for 
industries he had no other information and said he had seen no 
previous studies on the method 
in the test a hair sample is subjected to a chemical process 
called radioimmunoassay which reduces it to a solution that can be 
analyzed for a cocaine derivative 
hair grows about 1 centimeter per month so we can tell if 
someone stopped the cocaine a couple of months ago the new hair 
near the scalp will not have the cocaine anymore koren said 
he said the researchers main target was to find a way of 
determining drug use in pregnant women who do not admit it 
if there is a baby that looks very sick or has problems that 
cannot be explained by other factors we can tell with this test 
he said this means that in the future if we find cocaine in the 
hair of a baby even if the mother does not admit using it that 
means she did use it

a new federal drug law that imposes 
mandatory prison sentences is drawing complaints from california 
judges who say their authority is being undermined 
i dont think its the worlds most popular thing with 
judges said william ingram chief federal judge for the northern 
district of california 
we get in this business and over the years presumably develop 
some educated discretion with respect to disposition of criminal 
cases and that just takes discretion away you have to comply with 
the statute but i think many judges wish the statute would be 
repealed 
two weeks ago the issue came to a boil in the courtroom of us 
district judge robert schnacke a former longtime federal 
prosecutor and 1970 judicial appointee of president richard nixon 
the case was one where a crack cocaine prosecution in state 
court with a maximum 12year sentence was transferred by 
prosecutors to federal court where penalties are stiffer in this 
case a mandatory life term without parole because of defendant 
david hamiltons two prior convictions 
as jurors prepared to deliberate schnacke said he would 
normally tell them to ignore possible penalties because those were 
up to him but since he had no choice of sentence he said they 
should know that a conviction would be punished by life without 
parole 
on dec 1 the jury acquitted hamilton 30 of san francisco of 
the drug charge convicting him only of a gunpossession charge 
that has yet to be sentenced schnacke thanked the jurors for 
what i take to be an expression of concern about the nature of the 
compelled sentencing process that congress has imposed upon the 
courts 
the new federal drug law effective last november requires 
prison sentences without parole for certain types of drug crimes 
decisions that were formerly left up to the sentencing judge 
a first offender who possessed over 50 grams of crack cocaine 
for sale for example must serve at least 10 years without parole 
with a prior felony drug conviction the minimum sentence is 20 
years and with two prior drug felonies the mandatory sentence is 
life without the possibility of parole 
mandatory minimum sentences applied to some kinds of cases 
result in shocking injustice said federal judge william 
schwarzer judges are going to struggle to find ways to perform 
their sworn constitutional duty to do justice 
federal judges at all levels in the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals which covers california and eight other western states 
voted overwhelmingly earlier this year to urge congress to repeal 
the mandatory sentencing laws 
but us attorney joseph russoniello said schnackes action was 
unprecedented and had virtually dictated the verdict although 
hamiltons lawyer quoted jurors as saying the prosecution had 
failed to prove drug possession russoniello complained to us 
solicitor general kenneth starr but conceded there was nothing he 
could do because an acquittal cannot be appealed

jurors wept as they heard the testimony 
of a patient who survived a dose of a paralyzing drug from a 
hospital nurse then convicted richard angelo for causing four 
deaths 
angelo stared straight ahead thursday during the reading of the 
verdict finding him guilty of murder in two deaths manslaughter in 
a third and criminally negligent homicide in a fourth 
what this guy did to all of these people is beyond words 
said a sobbing kieran greene 24 whose father anthony was one of 
angelos victims greene hugged prosecutor john collins after the 
verdict was announced 
angelo 27 faces a maximum of 50 years to life for the murders 
when sentenced jan 17 
less than an hour before the verdict jurors in the eighth day 
of deliberations listened to testimony by former patient gerolamo 
kucich a 75yearold yugoslavian 
i was actually putting myself in his shoes juror michael 
loguercio said of kucich i walked out of there in tears this 
morning 
kucich testified during the trial that while he was a patient 
angelo had given him an injection saying it would make me feel 
better instead kucich was left fighting for breath 
this is probably a fair verdict said defense attorney eric 
naiburg 
the injections lethal doses of muscle relaxants occurred at 
good samaritan hospital in west islip on long island in the fall of 
1987 
angelo who was a nurse in the intensive care unit for about six 
months admitted to police he had planned to inject the patients 
then be first on the scene to revive them and be seen as a hero 
the jury also convicted angelo on thursday of assault charges in 
the deaths and in the injections he gave kucich he was acquitted 
of assaulting two patients whose deaths were not proved to be from 
the drugs 
naiburg had conceded in his closing statement that angelo 
injected the patients and that he may have caused some of their 
deaths but he had argued that angelo was not aware that the 
injections presented a grave risk to the patients a condition 
necessary for a murder conviction 
he had urged the jurors to find angelo guilty of criminally 
negligent homicide a lesser charge punishable by up to four years 
in jail 
the prosecutor john collins calling angelo a monster in 
nurses whites had argued that angelo had to know the risks 
involved especially after the first victim died 
suffolk county officials exhumed 33 bodies of patients at good 
samaritan who died suspiciously during angelos tenure the medical 
examiner found traces of pavulon in six of the bodies exhumed a 
pavulonlaced syringe was found in angelos apartment the day 
before his arrest 
county court judge alfred tisch remanded angelo without bail 
thursday to the county jail where he has been held since his 
arrest

a state water agency dropped its 100 million 
lawsuit against the city in exchange for municipal promises to 
spend even more to cut the flow of pollution into once pristine 
santa monica bay 
the bay fronting some of the worlds mostvisited beaches has 
provided background scenery to hollywood productions including the 
beach blanket movies gidget tv series and the film 
tequila sunrise 
it touches about 40 miles of wide whitesand beach from the 
palos verdes peninsula in the south to malibu in the north 
the agreement between the regional water quality control board 
and the city of los angeles lists 22 measures the city must pursue 
with costs estimated to surpass 100 million officials said 
thursday 
this is the way controversies between two government agencies 
should be handled mayor tom bradley said instead of fighting 
it out in the courts we solved it at the bargaining table 
the city agreed to take steps to prevent raw sewage spills at a 
treatment plant reduce pollutants washing out to sea from storm 
drains and improve sewage treatment 
a rash of sewage spills in 1987 prompted county health officials 
to close miles of beach angering surfers scuba divers and 
environmentalists 
the city also pledged to create new water reclamation and 
conservation programs and stage a museum exhibit to heighten public 
awareness on bay pollution 
the pact was approved by the city council in a closeddoor 
meeting tuesday and announced on thursday 
virtually all costs will be borne by the citys sewage surcharge 
tax imposed on homeowners and commercial landlords city officials 
said 
state attorney general john k van de kamp filed the suit in 
1987 seeking penalties of up to 20 a gallon for two major spills 
that dumped more than 54 million gallons of raw sewage into the 
bay

the state air resources board has approved a 
plan that could lead to widescale use of alternative fuels in 
california vehicles after 1997 
the proposed requirements would have major implications for 
auto makers and oil companies as well as for consumers go far 
beyond 1994 emission limits for conventional gasolinepowered cars 
that were adopted in june 
the new regulations would probably require use of such fuels as 
methanol compressed natural gas and electricity new emission 
control technologies would also be required 
this is the first time weve started to wean people away from 
gasoline and cars as we know them air resources board spokesman 
bill sessa said thursday 
the limits were contained in a board staff proposal that would 
have to be approved by the board next september 
without a new generation of motor vehicles the board said 
southern california air will not be able to meet federal clean air 
standards 
beginning in 1997 one out of every four cars sold in the state 
would have to emit 70 percent fewer hydrocarbons than required by 
the 1994 standard under the proposal by 1998 half of all cars 
sold would be required to meet the tougher standard 
in effect this would mean two tailpipe standards one for 
conventional gasoline cars based on the 1994 standard and another 
for socalled lowemission cars which the state would require 
to be sold in california 
the 1997 standard limits hydrocarbon emissions to 0075 grams 
per mile the 1994 standard limits them to 025 grams per mile 
federal standards now set hydrocarbon limits at 041 grams per 
mile over time the market share of lowemission cars would grow 
from less than 10 percent in 1994 to 100 percent of new cars sold 
in the year 2000 officials said 
oil companies would be required to sell alternative fuels at 
their service stations as a condition for continuing to sell 
gasoline in the state automobile makers would be required to make 
the loweremission vehicles in order to meet the tougher standards 
industry representatives said the proposed timetable was 
unrealistically fast and may not be technologically feasible 
the air quality management district which regulates air quality 
in the los angeles area said that next year it will consider a 
rule requiring operators of fleets of more than 15 vehicles to 
begin purchasing alternative cleanerfueled vehicles 
the districts goal is to have 40 percent of all cars 70 
percent of all trucks and 100 percent of buses running on cleaner 
fuels by 2000

every autopsy at the new york city medical 
examiners office will include an aids test in an effort to inform 
other people if they may be infected with the virus according to a 
published report today 
the test results will be used in statistical research and in 
contacttracing the tracking of an aids sufferers sexual 
partners or drugneedle sharers the new york times said 
officials at the centers for disease control in atlanta said 
they were unaware of any other such program in the country 
about 8000 autopsies are performed every year by the medical 
examiners office dr charles s hirsch the chief medical 
examiner said he expected to detect the aids virus in about 1000 
of the autopsies 
the testing has been approved by mayor edward i koch and was 
authorized monday by the medical examiners advisory board 
the results and the names of people who have been contacted will 
be kept confidential 
hirsch said testing would begin by years end after he discussed 
the program with groups involved with aids issues 
some people have expressed concern that contacttracing may lead 
to invasion of privacy 
but stephen c joseph the citys health commissioner denied 
that 
what argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting 
partner of someone who is dead he said its very compelling 
the absolute need to warn people at risk who might not learn any 
other way 
he said the program will be useful in evaluating the extent of 
the viruss spread in the city and be an extremely useful tool 
for epidemiologic control and prevention 
there are 75000 deaths every year in new york city autopsies 
are carried out for unusual or unexplained deaths and are required 
in homicides suicides and deaths from drug overdose 
many of those who die for unexplained reasons are believed to 
carry the aids virus particularly intravenous drug users

the soviet congress briefly halted work on 
reforming the economy today to pay tribute to andrei d sakharov 
the colleague who was the ruling communist partys most severe 
critic 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the 2250 members of the 
congress of peoples deputies stood for a moment of silence to 
remember the scientist whose challenge to the kremlins human 
rights policies led to nearly seven years of internal exile 
the 68yearold physicist who died thursday night in his moscow 
apartment was the peoples conscience said boris n yeltsin 
the maverick deputy who along with sakharov was a leader of a group 
considering whether to form an alternative political party 
all honest people in the ussr and throughout the world 
will grieve for him yeltsin said 
at the time of his death the nobel peace prize winner was 
preparing a speech he was to give to congress demanding that the 
communists constitutional guarantee on power be revoked a move 
made by czechoslovakia east germany and hungary in recent weeks 
in other developments in eastern europe 
east germany has established its first contacts with the 
international monetary fund west germanys foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher says in an interview published today that 
closer ties between the two german states contribute to stability 
in europe 
in sofia bulgaria up to 50000 people jeered and whistled 
thursday outside that hall where parliement delayed legally 
repealing the communist monopoly on power 
elsewhere nato foreign ministers meeting in brussels today 
endorsed a plan to allow unarmed military jets from eastern bloc 
countries to fly over their territory as part of efforts to further 
reduce eastwest military tensions 
vitaly i vorotnikov a member of the presidium of the congress 
opened todays session by announcing the death of sakharov who won 
the 1975 nobel peace prize for his human rights work vorotnikov 
paid tribute to sakharov both as a scientist and public figure 
all that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience his 
deep humanitarian convictions said vorotnikov a member of the 
ruling communist party politburo and president of the russian 
federation 
dmitri likhachev another scholardeputy told the chamber 
with sakharov a part of our heart has departed from us we could 
agree or disagree with him but he was a man of absolute sincerity 
and absolute purity and this led him to achievements in sicence 
and his position in public life 
the course of sakharovs independent group of delegates the 
400member interregional deputies group was unclear 
a strike that sakharov tried to organize monday had fizzled and 
deputies outvoted the independents to cut off debate on possibly 
changing an article of the soviet constitution that guaranteed the 
communist partys role as the leading force in society 
sakharov and historian yuri afanasyev said in an emotional 
threehour meeting thursday that it was time to call for a 
multiparty democratic system sakharov said thursday that gorbachev 
and the communist party leadership were leading the country to 
catastrophe prolonging the process of perestroika many years 
thursdays meeting came as the congress began dissecting the 
governments blueprint for economic reform with progressives 
complaining that it was not daring enough to improve the countrys 
grim financial condition 
premier nikolai ryzhkov announced wednesday that the kremlin 
believes it can revive the economy without resorting to such 
radical moves as legalization of private property and selling off 
moneylosing state enterprises 
progressives in congress reacted with scorn to ryzhkovs speech 
which promised five more years of bureaucratic control of such 
mundane details of life as the number of eggs produced per person 
the government proposal does shift the emphasis of traditional 
central planning away from heavy industry to consumer goods and 
services such enterprises are to quadruple in the next fiveyear 
plan from 19911996

presidents of colleges and universities with 
ncaa programs are being urged to support a proposal requiring 
disclosure of graduation rates among athletes as an alternative to 
a governmentmandated program 
federal intrusion in this area would set a very dangerous 
precedent and would open a door that we will never be able to close 
again james whalen chairman of the american council on 
education board of directors said thursday 
whalen said that if the proposal is not approved at the ncaa 
annual meeting jan 79 the congress of the united states will 
do it for us 
sen bill bradley dnj and rep tom mcmillen dmd are 
sponsoring legislation that would require colleges to disclose how 
many of their athletes graduate 
bradley and mcmillen both former professional basketball 
players contend the legislation would improve education standards 
for college athletes and provide students and their parents with 
valuable information about the school they plan to attend 
whalen president of new yorks ithaca college said the 
proposal has little chance of passing unless the majority of the 
presidents attend the meeting many presidents have traditionally 
sent a representative such as the athletic director

an epa spokeswoman says a planned agreement 
between the environmental protection agency and the army corps of 
engineers aimed at carrying out president bushs campaign pledge to 
preserve wetlands may be put on hold for 30 days 
the memorandum of agreement which was scheduled to take effect 
today has sparked an intense struggle within the administration 
the departments of energy and transportation oppose it and the 
council on environmental quality and the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration favor it 
congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity also 
said the interior department has split with the fish and wildlife 
service favoring immediate implementation and the minerals 
management service opposed 
environmentalists are keeping a close watch on the dispute 
which has been growing since epa and the corps initialled the new 
agreement early last month 
i think this is a real litmus test of bushs commitment to 
wetlands protection said jan goldmancarter counsel to the 
national wildlife 
in last years presidential campaign bush endorsed a policy of 
no net loss of wetlands like swamps bogs fens marshes and 
tidal estuaries often craved for residential commercial and 
agricultural development the goal emerged from recommendations of 
the conservation foundation whose then head william reilly was 
appointed epa administrator by bush 
in recent years environmentalists have come to recognize the 
value of these areas for wildlife habitat purification of polluted 
waterways flood control and other purposes

underneath all the celebrity writer truman 
capote was a melancholy lonely little man 
thats one of the points playwright jay presson allen makes with 
surprising poignancy in tru her terrific oneman show based on 
the life of the wellknown literary personality 
the play which opened thursday night at broadways booth 
theater examines a specific highly publicized life but its 
lessons are universal allen takes the man and makes his plight 
moving capote defeated by too much high and low life becomes the 
victim of his success or rather the success he has cant 
compensate for the rejection he feels from family friends lovers 
and a fickle public 
in the play the pudgy pintsized capote prowls his plush 
apartment at united nations plaza he tattles on the telephone in 
search of a dirt fix talks into a tape recorder for a 
biographer and eventually ends up speaking directly to the audience 
about his strange unhappy life 
the show takes place in the week before christmas 1975 its a 
momentous time for capote just after esquire magazine published an 
excerpt from his novelinprogress answered prayers in it 
capote savages some of his rich female friends such people as 
babe paley and lady nancy keith much to his surprise and anger 
they cut him off youd think i killed the lindbergh baby he 
whines 
capote proclaims himself an artist and a true artist has no 
friends he says but the man still craves the acceptance of these 
people their abandonment hurts him just as much as when his own 
mother left him as a child with her sisters in alabama 
there are some sweet remembrances of that time including a 
reading from a christmas memory a heartbreaking holiday story 
about his childhood and his favorite aunt 
capote is played with astonishing fidelity by robert morse the 
actor best known as a brash musical comedy performer is a 
revelation and not only because of kevin haneys remarkable makeup 
which transforms him into a credible likeness of capote 
his capote is wickedly funny a sly imp ready to deliver an 
offcolor joke about the queen mum zing robert goulet or 
rhapsodize about the time he tapdanced for louis armstrong his 
voice is soft and sibilant his body language languid except when 
he dives into a dance bopping to the girl from ipanema 
but theres a desperate side to capote too and morse rises to 
the pain the playwright conjures up a devastating moment in act 2 
when capote puts his fist through a portrait of himself as a young 
man a beautiful golden boy who let his life fall apart it earns 
gasps from the audience 
allen deftly weaves biographical facts into the evening 
refusing to present capote as merely a case study the production 
which the playwright also directed rarely falters as it builds to 
the loneliest of christmas eves 
the luxurious apartment designed by david mitchell offers an 
appropriately panoramic view of the east river and the gaudy 
furnishings include capotes own sofa lent by joanne carson 
its an opulent colorful setting the perfect environment for 
allens extravagant colorful subject but capote who died in 
1984 probably would have been interesting wherever he was and so 
is the play tru is an affecting portrait of a gifted but 
peculiar writer whose saddest story turned out to be his own 
broadway critics praised morse in the oneman show they also 
applauded allen but wished that he had delved deeper into capotes 
persona 
clive barnes in the new york post called morses performance a 
tour de force and said that with the allens help capote really 
does live again 
the daily news howard kissel said allen captures both 
capotes wit and malice beautifully and that morses work is 
sheer joy 
it is a shock not to mention a pleasure and delight to 
stumble on capotes ghost in the unlikely person of robert morse 
said linda winer in todays new york newsday but she said allen 
unfortunately does not touch the mysteries of what made capote a 
great writer when he was up to it 
frank rich of the new york times wishing for a stronger play 
said in place of a life portrait with depth tru settles for 
its windup madame tussaudss caricature of the wrecked 1975 model 
capote and while applauding morses efforts he said his 
performances leaves one eager to see him in other works

the new leader of east germanys communist party 
said the united states should work to keep the two germanys 
separate in the interests of europes stability the new york times 
reported today 
gregor gysi chairman of the oncedominant party said in an 
interview thursday that if east germany were united with the more 
powerful west germany his country would become the poorhouse 
of the new country 
but if unification is to happen he said it should happen 
quickly and simply 
gysi a 41yearold lawyer was elected communist party chairman 
saturday the party relinquished its monopoly on power last month 
gysi told the times the united states should not give up its 
responsibilities in europe 
if the continued independence of the german democratic 
republic is in the interests of stability in europe then you 
should think about whether you want to leave help for the gdr up to 
a single neighbor country and thereby create dependency or 
whether it wouldnt be better to share the responsibility to 
prevent the reemergence of greater germany he said 
gysi said the absorption of east germany into what he described 
as greater germany would create a dangerous economic imbalance in 
western europe and lead to rightwing nationalistic fervor he said 
that frenzy could lead to demands that borders established after 
world war ii be realigned to include former german territories now

french troops landed today on the comoros islands 
taking control of the countrys security in what the defense 
ministry called a military mission requested by the comoros 
government 
four hours later french mercenary bob denard and about 25 other 
european soldiers of fortune who trained and led the 600member 
comoran presidential guard boarded a south african military plane 
and left for south africa agence francepresse reported no 
violence was reported during the french operation 
the french government said earlier that the mercenaries had 
offered to relinquish control of the country but it was unclear 
whether an agreement was reached and if so what terms were offered 
a military spokesman said the soldiers came from the french 
indian ocean island of mayotte 185 miles away under a defense 
cooperation agreement between france and the comoros france once 
controlled the comoros islands 
both president francois mitterrand and defense minister 
jeanpierre chevenement had stressed earlier this week that there 
would be no french military intervention in the comoros 
the islands off southeast african have been in turmoil since the 
nov 26 assassination of president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
afp the french news agency said from comoran capital moroni 
that 50 french paratroopers in helicopters landed to take over 
control of the archipelago from the presidential guard they were 
followed by two transport planes full of troops 
denard and the presidential guard had been in control of the 
islands since the presidents assassination 
at one end of the runway 250 men of the presidential guard 
stood at attention along with denard dressed in civilian clothes 
awaiting the change of control afp reported 
about 25 of the french troops accompanied by the french 
military attache in moroni approached denard and his men and 
after a brief conversation the chief mercenary left the area afp 
said 
on thursday afp said denard was willing to relinquish control 
if the safety of his men was guaranteed and if he and his fellow 
mercenaries were given an unspecified payment it was unclear if 
those demands were honored 
the johannesburg star said south african officials planned to 
issue denard a temporary residence permit on condition he agreed to 
leave within a month 
most comorans believe denard and his mercenaries who first put 
abdallah into power in 1978 were responsible for his death denard 
has denied killing the president but he admitted during a news 
conference that he was in the room when the shooting occurred 
denard a veteran soldier of fortune in several asian and 
african conflicts claimed that abdallah was shot accidentally by a 
bodyguard 
six french and belgian mercenaries left moroni on thursday night 
on the air france flight for paris accompanied by wives and other 
family members afp reported they rest left today the agency said 
the intervention by the french the former colonial power a 
matter of an express request by the comoran authorities said the 
defense ministry in paris it is a takeover from the presidential 
guard 
both france and south africa the biggest aid suppliers to the 
comoros had cut off assistance and were putting strong pressure on 
denard and his men to leave negotiations had been going on for the 
past several days

a judge who was barraged with phone calls when 
the christian broadcasting network telecast her office phone number 
nationwide said it will not help reduce the sentence she gave the 
deputy director of operation rescue 
fulton county state court judge thelma wyatt cummings had 
sentenced michael mcmonagle to six months in jail after he refused 
to pay a 1000 fine after being convicted of obstructing a public 
sidewalk during an abortion protest 
if you believe that harassing telephone calls and harassing 
letters with pictures of dead babies will cause me to modify your 
sentence you are mistaken she told mcmonagle thursday 
i believe that if you file a proper motion for modification i 
will consider it in proper fashion the judge said this is 
having the opposite effect to what i believe you desire 
cbn reporter ty bragg presented a feature on the trials of 
opponents of legalized abortion in atlanta on thursday mornings 
700 club show he supplied cummings number and encouraged 
viewers to call and complain about the sentence given mcmonagle 
the judge said her secretary reported that calls were coming in 
at the rate of one per minute 
cummings also was upset by a statement in braggs report that a 
child pornographer had received a lighter sentence than mcmonagle 
i have not had a child pornography case in my 12 years on the 
bench cummings said 
frankie abourjilie vice president of public relations for the 
virginia beach vabased cbn said mcmonagle had no control over 
the show 
mcmonagle represented himself on a charge of obstructing a 
public sidewalk or passageway during a november trial the charge 
stemmed from a demonstration in october 1988 at the feminist 
womens health center mcmonagle was directing protesters with a 
bullhorn when he was arrested

in another concession to prodemocracy 
groups east germany said today it will disband the communist party 
militia further weakening the partys grip on power 
the announcement came a day after the government abolished the 
hated secret police often used to suppress any signs of dissent 
prodemocracy activists had demanded the breakup of both the 
militia and the secret police as the country moves toward free 
elections in may 
the militia once armed with antiaircraft guns automatic 
weapons armored personnel carriers and rocketpropelled grenades 
acted as the communist partys own army 
in a brief dispatch the state adn news agency said communist 
premier hans modrows government had agreed on an end to the work 
of the militia which it said would be completed by the end of 
june 1990 
according to western estimates the militia numbers 3000 active 
members but it is believed that 400000 could be called up on 
short notice 
the government already has begun disarming the militia which 
was put on alert to help crush the prodemocracy protests in 
october there were some reports that the militia had been put into 
action then 
east germanys communists have made increasing concessions to 
the opposition since hardline leader erich honeckers ouster on 
oct 18 the leadership has promised to separate government and 
communist party functions 
the communist nation has also established its first contacts 
with the international monetary fund as it breaks with the 
isolation of the past 
on thursday the leadership welcomed wideranging economic 
cooperation with west germany and earlier this week it expressed 
interest in closer ties with the united states 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher in an 
interview published today said that closer ties between the two 
german states contribute to stability in europe 
genscher also said that east germans will have a chance to 
decide between a socialist or freemarket system in elections 
planned in the spring and we will respect their decision 
according to the newspaper der morgen 
we remain a single nation the genscher said he envisaged 
the two german states growing together within a general process of 
overcoming the postwar division of europe and a demilitarization 
of eastwest relations 
late thursday adn said east german envoy peter dietze met with 
helen b junz the international monetary funds special trade 
representative 
adn called thursdays session in geneva the first contacts 
between the two sides saying dietze had expressed interest in the 
economic monetary political and financial experience of the 
imf 
the contacts are expected to be continued said adn but it 
did not say whether east germany will seek membership in the 
international organization 
a day earlier poland said it and the imf had agreed on a 
package of economic reforms and credit that is expected to 
stimulate a flow of western support for the east european nation 
the imf with headquarters in washington promotes monetary 
cooperation currency stabilization and trade expansion 
in brussels the european economic community named east germany 
as one of the eastern european countries that could qualify for 
western financial aid if east berlin seeks to adopt freemarket 
principles 
east germany has been showing greater interest in developing its 
foreign trade as demonstrated by the visit of west german 
economics minister helmut haussmann haussmann met with communist 
premier hans modrow and the two sides agreed to set up a joint 
economic commission and broaden cooperation 
east germany is seeking to attract more western capital while 
there are numerous signs of change on the diplomatic level as well 
after meeting with us secretary of state james a baker iii on 
tuesday modrow said that he looked forward to broader scientific 
and cultural ties with the united states in addition to more 
economic links 
baker is the highestranking us official to visit east germany 
in nearly two decades the sides established diplomatic relations 
in 1974 
modrow said he saw clear signs of us support for the current 
democratic and economic reform process under way in east germany 
all of the openings amount to a virtual revolution for east 
germany which as late as august was defending the berlin wall as 
an antifascist protection wall against plundering from an 
allegedly greedy west

scotlands chief law officer today 
announced the first public inquiry into the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 which exploded over scotland and killed 270 people 
lord fraser the lord advocate said criminal prosecution was 
not imminent but that he still hoped to find the terrorists who 
planted the bomb in a suitcase that brought down the flight on dec 
21 1988 
the boeing 747 packed with christmas travelers heading to new 
york from frankfurt and london exploded over the scottish town of 
lockerbie killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
investigators displayed pictures at a news conference today 
showing how they had reconstructed the part of the plane where the 
explosion occurred with a gaping hole in the forward cargo section 
the department of transport said aircraft often are 
reconstructed but that this represented quite an achievement 
because it involved many small pieces scattered over a large area 
police had said earlier they had recovered 85 percent of the 
aircraft 
in a statement released at the news conference fraser said the 
fatal accident inquiry similar to a coroners inquest will be 
held next year but that a date and place had not been set 
the inquirys scope will include whether reasonable 
precautions might have avoided the tragedy and possible 
defects in any system that might have contributed to the 
deaths fraser said 
he said the announcment was made today to give authorities time 
to organize the inquiry and notify people and that it had nothing 
to do with the first anniversary of the crash next week 
fatal accident inquiries are conducted by a sheriff sitting 
without a jury the sheriff will issue a finding on the evidence 
fraser said the inquiry would have power under scottish law to 
order foreign evidence although it could not request people 
overseas to appear relatives of the victims are entitled to attend 
or be represented 
investigators remain determined to bring the evil perpetrators 
of this mass murder to justice fraser said this appalling 
terrorist outrage was an affront to civilized people 
everywhere 
there are two investigations already under way in britain the 
criminal probe headed by the dumfries and galloway constabulary and 
a crash probe by the department of transports air accident 
investigation branch neither of those investigations are being 
held in public 
george esson chief of the constabulary said his investigation 
had focused on the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command or pflpgc an extremist palestinian 
group headed by ahmed jibril 
it would be right to say that we have focused our attention on 
one group but it would be unwise to rule out other 
possibilities he said 
asked whether that group was the pflpgc he said certainly 
investigators have said a bomb made of plastic explosive was 
packed in a toshiba radiocassette player and hidden in a suitcase 
which was loaded into a forward cargo hold they displayed a photo 
today showing the reconstructed metal container which held the 
suitcase bomb 
esson said scottish investigators still believe the suitcase 
bomb either started or passed through the frankfurt airport 
where the flight originated west german police maintain there is 
not enough evidence to prove that 
fraser and esson were asked about mohammad abu talb a member of 
another radical palestinian group who is charged in sweden with 
four bombings in northern europe he was identified in a swedish 
court as a suspect in the lockerbie bombing and police seized 
clothing from his home reportedly to compare with shreds of 
clothing found in the wreckage 
i have at present no intention to seek the extradition of abu 
talb fraser said 
esson said he is certainly an individual in whom we have an 
interest he added that investigators wanted to talk with many 
people but he refused to identify them further 
fraser asked about the contents of the baggage that contained 
the bomb said investigators also had found items of clothing 
which have been further identified and located he refused to 
elaborate 
fraser denied that he was pessimistic about prosecutions and 
said investigators had made impressive progress aided by 
outstanding forensic work and unprecedented international 
cooperation 
what we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an 
international terrorist jigsaw esson said we have some of the 
pieces some we are trying to place and some we have yet to find

andrei d sakharov the brilliant physicist who 
built the soviet hydrogen bomb and became an unwavering beacon for 
the world in the cause of human rights has died at age 68 
the 1975 nobel peace prize winner died alone in his study 
thursday night of an apparent heart attack said his soninlaw 
yefrem yankelevich sakharov died as he had lived the last two 
decades of his life struggling for democracy world peace and 
human liberty 
president mikhail s gorbachev who freed sakharov from nearly 
seven years of internal exile but clashed with him repeatedly over 
the scale and speed of new soviet political reforms mourned the 
death as a great loss 
he was a man of conviction and sincerity gorbachev said 
he was not some sort of political intriguer he was a person who 
had his own ideas his own convictions which he expressed openly 
and directly this doesnt mean i agreed with him although on many 
things we did agree 
sakharov risked his status as a national scientific hero and the 
honors the soviet union had heaped upon him to openly challenge the 
government when most others were silent he was vilified attacked 
by the authorities and banished from moscow in 1980 the exile 
sapped his vitality and undermined his health 
after he was freed by gorbachev three years ago he won a seat 
in the soviet congress he used it as a forum to press for reform 
and freedom in his country gaining new stature as a conscience of 
the nation 
tributes to the brave humanist came from around the world 
sakharovs death occurred after a long day of struggle to 
organize an opposition to the communist party he was preparing a 
speech demanding that the communists guaranteed hold on power be 
revoked yankelevich said 
the defiant activists final words to his family were 
tomorrow there will be battle yankelevich said 
sergei kovalev a fellow human rights activist in moscow and a 
friend said the body was found by sakharovs wife yelena bonner 
bonner was his full partner in their human rights campaigns that 
embraced any cause fought any injustice and gave strength and 
courage to victims and to those who wanted to reform the soviet 
union 
bonner his strength and his companion during the years of 
struggle and exile sat in a chair next to the body a few close 
friends were admitted to the apartment said a friend who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
just hours before he died sakharov stood on the floor of the 
congress of peoples deputies and demanded that opposition 
delegates form an alternative party to the communists 
he told his fellow opposition congressmen that gorbachev and the 
communist party leadership were leading the country to 
catastrophe prolonging the process of perestroika many years 
it was the latest call in his final cause to end seven decades 
of guaranteed communist supremacy 
the 2250seat congress formed a committee to organize 
sakharovs funeral and gorbachev said he and the entire body will 
attend at his own request sakharov will be buried alongside his 
parents monday at vostryakovskoe cemetery on the southwestern edge 
of moscow said a scientific secretary at the lebedev physics 
institute where sakharov worked 
vitaly i vorotnikov a member of the presidium of the congress 
opened todays session with an announcement of the death of one of 
the chambers bestknown deputies a man who was officially 
vilified for decades 
he paid tribute to sakharov both as a scientist and public 
figure 
all that he did was dictated by his sleepless conscience his 
deep humanitarian convictions said vorotnikov a member of the 
communist party politburo and president of the russian federation 
gorbachev joined the congress in standing for a moment of 
silence out of respect for the congress member 
dmitri likhachev another scholardeputy told the chamber 
with sakharov a part of our heart has departed from us 
yankelevich told reporters at the apartment that his 
fatherinlaw died last night of what the doctors say was a heart 
attack we dont exactly know the cause of death yet 
yankelevich said sakharov had left his apartment about 9 pm to 
go downstairs to another apartment in the same building where he 
had a study crammed with books and papers from his scientific and 
political careers

sakharov had suffered from angina but during a visit to the 
united states in december 1988 doctors at massachusetts general 
hospital determined he did not need heart surgery or a pacemaker 
after cardiovascular tests 
he had aged visibly in recent months which were busy with 
international speaking trips and his work as a member of the new 
competitively elected congress 
a white house statement today hailed sakharov as a historic 
figure whose voice was an important dimension in the contemporary 
changes under way in soviet society 
human rights activist natan sharansky who spent nine years in 
soviet labor camps before immigrating to israel in 1986 told 
israel radio today that sakharov had tremendous influence 
among dissidents among free people in the soviet union and who by 
his own personal example helped change the whole climate in the 
soviet union 
in strasbourg france the european parliament unanimously paid 
tribute today to sakharov whose name it had given to its human 
rights prize 
secretary of state james a baker iii attending a nato summit 
in brussels belgium said he was a tremendous force for peace 
and freedom 
the congress formed a committee to organize sakharovs funeral 
the official tass news agency said it was a reflection of 
sakharovs trek from his years as a lonely voice opposed to kremlin 
policies to again becoming a honored member of society 
born may 21 1921 sakharovs first became known as a great 
scientist inducted into the academy of sciences in 1953 at age 32 
the youngestever member like his father he became a physicist 
in 1948 he joined physicist igor tamm in developing the 
hydrogen bomb and for 20 years lived and worked in secrecy with 
privileges that included a good apartment driver high salary and 
government awards but sakharov began to worry about the morality 
of developing weapons of mass destruction 
he had his first brush with top soviet officials in 1961 when 
he appealed to premier nikita s khrushchev to stop nuclear weapons 
tests khrushchev responded that scientists shouldnt meddle in 
politics two years later the soviet union agreed to such limits 
in a treaty with the united states 
after sakharov formed the human rights committee in 1970 he 
became better known as a dissident leader clashing with four 
kremlin leaderships over human rights foreign policy and the 
morality of the nuclear weaponry he helped create 
as an emerging dissident sakharov appeared to be immune to 
official sanctions while other prominent dissidents were forced to 
emigrate or sent to labor camps but in 1973 sakharov was warned 
by authorities that his interviews and statements were used by the 
foreign press for antisoviet slander and that he should be aware 
of the consequences 
sakharov continued to speak out and he and his wife attended 
the trials of prominent dissidents and lent their names to 
international appeals for prisoners of conscience in all countries 
to be freed 
the physicists tireless campaigns on behalf of disarmament and 
human rights won him the 1975 nobel peace prize and he steadfastly 
argued that without international respect for human rights there 
could be no guarantee of peace 
he was stripped of his soviet awards after he criticized the 
1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan and thensoviet leader leonid 
brezhnev banished him in january 1980 to gorky 200 miles east of 
moscow 
sakharov was never charged with any crime or put on trial 
reporters foreign visitors and diplomats who knew sakharov 
described him as a modest man of patience and humor but determined 
once his ire was aroused 
he was released in december 1986 and recalled to moscow by 
gorbachev 
he swiftly took a leading role in urging the soviet leader to 
follow through on gorbachevs twin policies of perestroika or 
restructuring and glasnost or openness 
he was elected to the congress of peoples deputies this year 
completing a remarkable comeback in june he told the soviet 
congress he had no regrets i am proud of this exile in gorky 
like a medal i wear

the crumbling of communist rule in eastern 
europe is prompting some to proclaim that history at least in 
terms of ideological struggle is over and the championship belt 
goes to democratic capitalism 
not so fast say dissenters on the left history is not over by 
a long shot dont count marxism out just yet 
in the united states longtime us communist party leader gus 
hall yearns for the good old days when the soviet union was less 
inclined toward revisionist thought 
hall was so incensed at the irreverent views of a leading soviet 
reform organ moscow news that he urged his allies in the 
birthplace of lenin to have the editor removed 
otherwise said hall they could burn down the goddamn 
building i mean get rid of it as hall sees it the interests of 
class struggle preclude capitalisms right to exist hall also had 
no patience with prodemocracy demonstrators in china finding them 
entirely too proamerican 
halls views may seem increasingly quaint in a world where 
marxists increasingly are on the defensive but the far left does 
not give up easily 
in this hemisphere cuban president fidel castro still boasts a 
devout following among some of his countrymen and the leftist cause 
continues to persuade many in nicaragua and el salvador to take up 
arms 
dont tell the salvadoran rebels that democratic capitalists are 
on the side of history they see around them all the evils that 
karl marx spoke of exploitation class stratification disease 
unemployment and illiteracy 
to these combatants there is considerable allure to a 
philosophy socialism which guarantees equality and the 
right to health care education and employment 
the salvadoran militants dont want to hear about the hundreds 
of thousands who have been demonstrating in prague for the past two 
months demanding an end to 40 years of misrule 
they want an end to more than a century and a half of misrule in 
their own country obviously there are many in el salvador who 
believe that a rebelled government would only make things worse 
and dont tell the hardliners within nicaraguas leadership 
about the wonders of democratic capitalism most of latin america 
has lived under elected civilian governments for the past decade a 
period marked by one of the steepest economic declines in the 
regions history 
the sandinistas blame the armed uprising washington has been 
supporting for almost a decade for their inability to improve the 
lot of their citizens 
perhaps the most irrepressible defender of the marxist faith 
these days is castro who believes someone must stand up for the 
thousands of millions of people in the world who live in inhuman 
conditions 
castro blames this state of affairs on the colossal looting 
of imperialist countries led by the united states 
dont talk to castro about the more than 200000 east germans 
who have fled to west germany this year hed rather talk about the 
40000 children who die each day around the world a hiroshima and 
a nagasaki as he puts it every three days 
standing before a gathering of his countrymen last week castro 
warned of the dangers of reverting to capitalist rule 
prostitution drugs gambling begging unemployment abysmal 
inequality between citizens 
he believes communism is too young a philosophy to give up on 
especially when one considers the alternative this notion of 
course is being rejected by millions of east europeans who believe 
it is farfetched to suggest the flaws of marxism can be corrected 
as castro suggests with mere fine tuning

it was a case in which the judge had to 
read the jury its rights rights to the 1000 prize from a 
lottery ticket that came with lunch 
the panel deliberating in a product liability case wasnt sure 
if it could keep the cash because the government paid for the 
lunch so jurors asked us district judge barbara crabb who was 
presiding over the trial 
bailiff sandy bowe said crabb laughed and said to instruct the 
jury that nothing could be done with the ticket until they decided 
the case being tried 
the lunches which bowe picked up at a delicatessan included 
four instant cash match tickets as a promotion and when a 
juror scratched the tickets one was a 1000 winner 
the eight jurors asked to split the prize and on wednesday 
after the case was settled the judge agreed 
she said she relied on the motion picture miracle on 34th 
street and christmas spirit for precedent 
the bailiff gave the jury four unnegotiated tickets which in 
that state had a negligible value the judge wrote in a decision 
that had the density if not the weight of an actual judicial ruling 
since there was nothing improper about giving uncashed tickets 
of trivial value to the jury there is no basis for either the 
bailiff or the government to try to reassert ownership of the 
tickets or their proceeds 
we need not decide which of the jurors has any greater claim 
to the prize ticket over any of the others in the best spirit of a 
jury the jurors have agreed to share equally in any prize money to 
which they may be entitled

someone has given lt gov bill hobby a 
pounding headache by walking off with the wooden gavel he used 
during a recent special session of the texas legislature 
who would have ever thought someone would take the gavel 
saralee tiede the lieutenant governors executive assistant said 
thursday she said the gavel has been missing since legislators 
left austin earlier this week after wrapping up the session on 
workers compensation revisions 
i mean we operate on the honors system here she said 
its kind of understood that you dont make off with the 
paintings on the wall you dont take the bronze busts and you 
dont steal the gavel 
the oak gavel made by texas prison inmates is nearly 2 feet 
long and weighs about 4 pounds 
it doesnt have much monetary value tiede said however 
it has a lot of sentimental value at this point we thought hobby 
might want to present it to someone 
carleton turner senate sergeantatarms issued a memo to all 
senate offices wednesday asking staff members to look out for the 
gavel 
im not assuming any of the senators did it turner said 
the senate chamber is open at times when there is nobody in 
there it would have been easy for someone to slip in and take it 
state sen carl parker who opposed the workers compensation 
legislation proposed by hobby suggested that it was was probably 
stolen by a representative of the insurance industry who wants to 
enshrine it as a holy object

thatcher 
meanwhile the hong kongs governor said no more boat people 
will be sent home against their will before christmas 
refugees in six camps around this british colony took part in 
todays demonstrations which have widened in scope daily since the 
forced repatriation of 51 boat people on tuesday 
the protesters are among about 44000 vietnamese who have sailed 
into hong kong since june 1988 and are considered illegal 
economic migrants unless they can prove they fled their 
communist homeland fearing persecution 
nearly 6800 have been denied refugee status after being 
screened by immigration officials and face repatriation compared 
with slightly more than 700 who have qualified for overseas 
resettlement 
although the protests have been peaceful about 100 vietnamese 
late thursday attacked a prison officer with iron bars as he 
investigated a crowd gathering inside the chi ma wan camp the 
officer suffered minor injuries 
today about 4000 boat people marched inside the whitehead 
detention center in the new territories about 2500 others chanted 
slogans as they marched between huts in the high island reception 
center next to a rural park the government said 
about 550 boat people staged a sitin at sek kong detention 
center in the new territories 3000 others participated in the 
third day of protest marches at hei ling chau camp on an outlying 
island and 1000 vietnamese demonstrated at sham shui po detention 
center in urban kowloon a few hundred protested at chi ma wan 
an effigy of mrs thatcher who has strongly defended the forced 
repatriation program by this british colony was burned at the sham 
shui po protest a government spokesman said 
governor sir david wilson said today that more vietnamese will 
be sent back against their will but we havent got a flight plan 
before christmas 
wilson acknowledged the program has led to widespread 
international criticism saying we certainly face the fact there 
has been a very emotional reaction against what weve done 
but he added that none of the critics has put forth a viable 
alternative to solve the problem posed by the massive influx of 
boat people 
journalists have not been allowed inside the detention centers 
in recent weeks but relief agencies say the atmosphere is tense 
i think the feeling is that there is a great deal of tension 
in the camps said jim campion of refugee concern hong kong an 
advocacy group for the boat people whether that is going to 
spill out or explode remains to be seen 
about 56000 vietnamese are housed in squalid camps in hong 
kong but only 4500 refugees have been resettled so far this year 
britain argues returning the refugees home is more humane than 
keeping them indefinitely in crowded centers that are rife with 
violence and disease 
the united states has condemned the forced repatriation 
the approximately 12000 boat people in hong kong who arrived 
before june 1988 are considered refugees eligible for resettlement

nato foreign ministers today endorsed a 
plan to allow unarmed military jets from eastern bloc countries to 
fly over their territory as part of efforts to further reduce 
eastwest military tensions 
the endorsement ended two days of talks and followed the 
announcement of a a historic visit by soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze to north atlantic treaty organization 
headquarters tuesday the first ever by a soviet foreign minister 
the ministers proposed that the overflights include europe the 
soviet union the united states and canada larger countries would 
allow several flights a month 
the nato position will be presented to eastern negotiators at a 
conference in february in ottawa 
plans for the soviet visit overshadowed the opening day of nato 
talks during which us secretary of state james a baker iii 
outlined plans for shaping a wider political role for the alliance 
in an era of reduced tensions 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner told reporters that 
during the soviet visit the two sides will discuss matters of 
common interest this is a first contact 
baker in a separate news conference quipped i dont see it 
paving the way for soviet membership in nato 
he said he doubted he would make a similar visit to the warsaw 
pact because the sovietled alliance has no exact counterpart to 
woerner 
shevardnadze will be in brussels on monday and tuesday to sign a 
new trade and economic cooperation agreement with the 12nation 
european community 
in their final statement the ministers welcomed the political 
and economic reforms under way in the soviet union and eastern 
europe and urged that the progress achieved must be consolidated 
many problems remain they said the rule of law and 
democratic government through free elections have yet to be fully 
institutionalized 
there was no alternative they said to the alliances strategy 
of deterrence to prevent war based on a mix of conventional and 
nuclear weapons 
opening nato skies to unarmed warsaw pact planes was first 
proposed by president bush in the spring 
the willingness of a country to be overflown is in itself a 
highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its 
availability to openness the nato ministers said aerial 
inspection also represents a particularly effective means of 
verification of arms control agreements 
under the plan countries would be assigned quotas based on 
their geographic size limiting the number of observation flights 
by unarmed fixedwing aircraft the duration of flights would also 
be limited 
the ministers gave their backing to the eventual reunification 
of east and west germany but through peaceful and democratic means 
the language was identifical to that included in a statement issued 
over the weekend by leaders of the 12nation european community at 
a summit in strasbourg france 
they reiterated the importance of nato as an indispensable 
foundation of stability security and cooperation for the future of 
europe 
the ministers said the surveillance could be used in making sure 
countries comply with the conventional arms agreement being 
negotiated in vienna between nato and the warsaw pact they also 
renewed their commitment to reach an agreement this year on 
reducing tanks armored personnel carriers and other military 
hardware in europe 
on thursday baker sketched his ideas for a broader political 
role for the alliance he foresees nato as a permanent monitor of 
the reductions being negotiated in conventional or nonnuclear 
arms in europe and as a mediator of regional conflicts

jaguar plc says it will start producing a limited 
edition of a 576000 car that can attain speeds of more than 200 
mph 
chairman sir john egan said thursday that the car the xj220 is 
as exciting as jaguars dtype which was introduced in the 1950s 
it is a very interesting project and could herald a pattern for 
the future he said 
the concept model was first revealed at the international motor 
show last year and consumer interest was so strong that jaguar 
believes it is assured of getting buyers for an initial production 
of 220 cars 
output could increase to a maximum of 350 cars if demand is 
strong enough said the chairman of the british car maker which is 
being acquired by ford motor co for 25 billion 
after this we might look at another limited edition more 
super cars could follow if there is a demand he said he added 
that more than 200 new jobs would be created when production 
started at a new factory currently being built in oxfordshire in 
western england 
fifty engineers were already working on the project he said 
the car will be available in lefthand and righthand drive but 
will not be exported to the united states since it will only meet 
european regulations 
the cars are to be sold on a firstcome firstserved basis 
each of the cars will be numbered and customers will have to put 
down a deposit of 80000 the cars will be delivered in 1992 
jaguar said

andrei d sakharov was remembered today by 
colleagues in science human rights and public affairs as the 
conscience of a nation struggling to free itself from decades of 
official lies and corruption 
mikhail s gorbachev who freed the physicist from seven years 
of internal exile called sakharov a man of conviction and 
sincerity 
its a great loss gorbachev said academician sakharov 
during this time of perestroika had his mission his role and that 
we all understood 
he was a person who had his own ideas his own convictions 
which he expressed openly and directly this doesnt mean i agreed 
with him although on many things we did agree he said 
gorbachev had repeatedly clashed with sakharov recently over the 
pace and type of reform in the soviet union 
we have lost our moral compass said roald sagdeyev the 
former head of the soviet space program who worked with sakharov in 
the congress of peoples deputies and the soviet academy of 
sciences and was named to an official funeral commission 
an outstanding person has died such as maybe appears once in 
a hundred years said fellow deputy alexei kazannik of omsk 
the congress of peoples deputies including both supporters and 
political foes of sakharov stood for a minute of silence today 
morning when his death thursday night was announced 
linguist dmitri likhachev one of the countrys most respected 
scholars told the deputies with sakharov a part of our heart 
has departed from us we could agree or disagree with him but he 
was a man of absolute sincerity and absolute purity and this led 
him to achievements in science and his position in public life 
even longtime members of the communist party apparatus which 
under president leonid i brezhnev in 1980 ordered his exile to the 
industrial city of gorky praised his honesty and principle 
sakharov was exiled jan 22 1980 for criticizing the soviet 
intervention in afghanistan less than a month earlier but society 
as well as top officials now agree with sakharovs point of view 
politburo member vitaly i vorotnikov a politburo member told 
the congress that sakharov had been one of the countrys greatest 
scientists a major public figure 
everything that he did was dictated by his tireless 
conscience his deep humanitarian convictions vorotnikov said 
another politburo member conservative yegor k ligachev told 
the tass news agency i was very well disposed toward sakharov as 
a personality 
he did much for the country he adhered to different views and 
positions but this is only natural ligachev said 
sakharovs last political battle was to try to break the 
monopoly on political power enjoyed by vorotnikov ligachev and 
other members of the communist party apparatus 
sakharov said in his last public statement that the leadership 
was bringing the country to a catastrophe he supported a call to 
create a formal political opposition 
yuri afanasyev a historian who sided with sakharov in that 
political battle pledged to continue his work we will continue 
to support the things that he devoted his life to afanasyev said 
communist reformer boris n yeltsin who with afanasyev and 
sakharov was a cochairman of the interregional deputies group of 
legislators told tass that sakharov was the peoples conscience 
and all honest people in the ussr and throughout the world will 
grieve for him 
sakharovs relationship with gorbachev was difficult politically 
but based on a mutual understanding of each others importance 
said historian roy medvedev who knew sakharov for many years 
sakharov realized the great significance of gorbachevs 
reforms while gorbachev realized sakharovs significance in 
political life helped him return to politics medvedev told tass 
sometimes sakharov went even further and demanded from soviet 
society more than it could provide but he always treated gorbachev 
with great respect and always stressed this he said 
a veteran us embassy official in moscow deputy chief of 
mission john m joyce told reporters sakharov was important to his 
country both for the practical work he did and as a symbol of 
something better 
if this country is fortunate the goals he set will someday be 
reality joyce said

the national transportation safety board said 
today it will conduct a hearing focusing on boeing 737 rudder trim 
design and cockpit performance in the crash of a usair jetliner at 
new yorks laguardia airport 
the fourday hearing is to begin feb 13 at the penta hotel in 
new york said spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
the sept 20 accident in which the aircraft skidded off the end 
of the runway into new yorks east river after pilots aborted its 
takeoff killed two passengers the plane lodged on a landing pier 
and broke into pieces 
board chairman james kolstad who will conduct the hearing said 
he expects about 16 witnesses to testify on cockpit crew training 
and coordination design and operation of the rudder trim system 
and other issues 
as tragic as this accident was it could have been much 
worse kolstad said we have mechanical and human performance 
issues to resolve in the course of this investigation and the 
hearing will provide us with valuable information on both issues 
the board did not announce who the witnesses would be but 
surviving crew members often testify at such hearings we may not 
know until just before the hearing whether they will appear said 
lopatkiewicz 
investigators said the planes tail rudder used in steering the 
airliner was misaligned despite evidence that the crew made all 
the proper checks the pilot reported the plane was drifting to the 
left before he aborted the takeoff this focused attention on the 
trim system that holds the rudder steady during takeoff 
the federal aviation administration suspended the pilots 
licenses of capt michael w martin and copilot constantine 
kleissas after the crash for their failure to appear immediately 
for drug tests and questioning by investigators 
the safety boards new york hearing will include a panel of 
senior ntsb staff members and a technical panel of investigators 
as well as representatives of the faa the boeing co and the air 
line pilots association 
the board which is an independent federal agency has no 
rulemaking or enforcement powers its findings of probable cause 
and recommendations will be included in a report to be adopted at a 
public meeting several months after the hearing although it can 
issue urgent recommendations at any time

the metropolitan transportation authority voted 
today to increase transit fares raising the new york city subway 
fare from 1 to 115 
the new fares most of which represent an increase of about 15 
percent take effect jan 1 
they range from the 15cent increase for subways and buses to a 
50 cent rise to 4 for express buses in queens and staten island 
and an 85 cent increase to 635 for the jfk airport express train 
the board approved the changes as demonstrators waved signs 
protesting the fare hike and chanted do the right thing stop 
the fare hike one signholder was hustled from the hearing room 
after he approached the table where the board members were seated 
initially the transit authority proposed sending bus and subway 
fares to 125 with discount packages of 18 selling for 20 
opponents claimed the idea would discriminate against lowincome 
riders 
the hearings and the publiccomment period served their 
purpose which was to get the views of the public and translate 
them to some degree to the proposals that are being made said 
tito davila a spokesman for the state metropolitan transportation 
authority 
the 15cent increase will add about 200 million to transit 
authority coffers the railroads would add another 49 million or 
so and the suburban buses 3 million to 4 million davila said

redoubt volcano hurled a cloud of 
volcanic ash into the sky again early today a day after it roared 
into action and a pilot reported the gritty ash cloud extended 160 
miles from the mountain 
thursdays eruption the volcanos first activity in 23 years 
flung ash seven miles high and prompted the evacuation of seven oil 
workers 
don richter a geologist with the us geological survey said 
redoubt erupted today from 140 am to about 430 am 
it was powerful richter said 
a pilot reported an ash cloud extending from redoubt to 
talkeetna at 339 he said adding that there were some reports 
of flashing lights that probably were caused by glowing lava 
richter said the highaltitude cloud of airborne ash blew past 
anchorage and was falling in less populated areas 
he said more eruptions were likely i dont like to use the 
word normal but a group of eruptions is typical of a volcano 
he said 
thursdays eruption of redoubt near the western edge of cook 
inlet 115 miles southwest of anchorage came a day after 
scientists detected a significant increase in seismic activity the 
geological survey said 
it looked like a little cloud rising over the mountain and it 
just started rising like an atomic bomb when it mushrooms said 
kristopher paull pilot of an airliner in the area thursday 
ash rose from 15000 feet to about 40000 feet within 10 
minutes said air force capt steve stoddard who was flying an 
f15 jet fighter west of anchorage 
seven of 11 workers at the drift river oil storage facility were 
evacuated as a precaution against flooding from melting snow said 
the manager of cook inlet pipeline co operator of the facility 
such flooding occurred when the volcano last erupted in 1966 
manager harold mouser said the workers were transported in two 
airplanes one of which was at the site for a routine grocery 
delivery a helicopter stood by for possible evacuation of the four 
employees who remained at the site as monitors he said 
a truck driver who was on the sterling highway across the inlet 
from the volcano when the eruption occurred said the ash was 
real white and fluffy almost like a cumulus cloud 
john paskievitch a geologist for the us geological survey 
said seismic activity beneath the volcano returned to normal soon 
after the eruption he said it was impossible to predict whether 
more eruptions would occur 
the alaska division of emergency services said a light dusting 
of ash was observed in the wasilla area about 40 miles northeast 
of anchorage shortly after noon thursday 
redoubt volcano is within the lake clark national park and 
preserve and has been active at least four times during this 
century

freely 
former french president valery giscard destaing recalled 
sakharovs legendary drive and benevolence 
i remember the emotion i felt last winter climbing the damp 
and dilapidated stairway that led to his apartment it was he who 
partially opened the door i saw on his face the signs of a great 
man intelligence and goodness 
he seemed luminous that light has gone out the flame that 
lived within him will burn forever his way of defending liberty 
and human rights was not that of a doctrinaire but of a liberal 
in the passion of his combat he conserved his benevolence

political prisoners and changed the penal code so that bulgarians 
can no longer be prosecuted for antistate activity and 
crimes against allied states 
on thursday justice minister svetla daskalova told parliament 
that 53 prisoners would be released in the amnesty it was not 
immediately clear if other political detainees would remain in 
custody 
the vote on the penal code changes was unanimous 
last month parliament granted amnesty to people jailed for 
slandering the state and the communist party before they were 
freed independent rights groups in the west said there were up to 
250 political prisoners in bulgaria

publicized figures on the countrys defense spending dzhurov told 
lawmakers the nation spent 670 million over the past year and that

communist leader todor zhivkov of all his public functions 
formally terminated his role as commander in chief of the armed 
forces which he held as president he lost that post after being 
replaced as party chief by petar mladenov on nov 10 
the national assembly made president mladenov commander in chief 
the moves are the latest in bulgarias whirlwind drive to 
transform itself from a hardline communist state to one at the 
forefront of the prodemocracy reform movement sweeping eastern 
europe 
when the legislature opened its session thursday tens of 
thousands of people demonstrated outside the building to demand 
that the partys leading role as provided for in the constitution 
be abolished 
the communist faction in the parliament had proposed the 
constitutional clause be scrapped but officials in parliament used 
a legal technicality to postpone debate on the proposal until 
january 
before it closed its session this afternoon parliament adopted 
its agenda for the january session which will include debate on a 
new electoral law providing for free elections and a law on 
redistribution of land in this traditionally agrarian country 
in accordance with another communist proposal adopted at a party 
central committee session this week parliament set up a commission 
to investigate corruption under the zhivkov regime

the nations high court today 
overturned convictions imposed in a controversial treason trial and 
set free five black activists three of them senior antiapartheid 
leaders jailed since 1985 
its fantastic because now justice has been vindicated 
said anglican archbishop desmond tutu when he and other supporters 
were told the five men were being flown from their island prison in 
cape town to johannesburg 
the three leaders of the united democratic front and one of 
their codefendants a church worker were convicted of treason in 
november 1988 after a threeyear trial their sentences ranged from 
six to 12 years 
the appeal court in bloemfontein overturned the verdicts of 
those four and seven codefendants convicted of terrorism one of 
the seven who was serving a fiveyear term was freed the others 
had received suspended sentences 
the appeal court accepted defense lawyers arguments that the 
trial judge kees van dijkhorst improperly dismissed one of the 
two legal experts assisting him in the trial 
van dijkhorst had said the law professor wa joubert was too 
sympathetic to the united democratic front because he had signed a 
udfsupported petition opposing a new constitition that entrenched 
racially segregated politics 
during the trial most of the defendants were granted bail 
but van dijkhorst repeatedly denied bail requests by the three 
leaders of the united democratic front a huge multiracial 
coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for black political rights 
lawyers for human rights an association of civil rights 
lawyers hailed the appeal court ruling as an excellent victory 
that would help restore the crebility of the south african 
judiciary 
the group called on the government to disclose how much it spent 
on this abortive prosecution which took years of blundering 
incompetence to achieve nothing but red faces 
ambassador ronald maclean of canada one of many countries which 
denounced the sentences said the appeal court ruling was the 
best christmas present imaginable 
van dijkhorst had ruled that the united democratic front was a 
revolutionary organization which incited violence in black 
townships in 1984 in a bid to render south africa ungovernable 
patrick lekota 41 the fronts publicity secretary was 
sentenced to 12 years in prison pope molefe 37 the fronts 
national secretary and moses chikane 41 secretary of the 
transvaal province branch were sentenced to 10 years the rev tom 
manthata 49 a church field worker was sentenced to six years 
the trial began in 1985 in the small farming town of delams and 
later was shifted to pretoria eleven of the original 22 defendants 
were acquitted at various stages 
the four men convicted of treason were imprisoned on robben 
island in cape towns harbor where many political and security 
prisoners have been held friends and relatives gathered at a ferry 
dock in cape town awaiting their arrival 
among the crowd was manthatas 5yearold daughter goitse who 
was crying with joy 
all four men are married and have children lekota and chikane 
each have daughters who were born after they were jailed in 1985 
and who have never seen their fathers as free men 
also on hand at the ferry landing was one of the defense 
attorneys david dyson he said the appeal court ruling appeared to 
be based solely on legal questions and doubted it was related to 
the changing political climate brought about by president fw de 
klerks easing of curbs on opposition activity 
the trial was one of the longest in south african history with 
439 days of court proceedings spread over more than three years 
the 368page indictment named more than 900 alleged 
coconspirators ranging from anglican archbishop desmond tutu to 
african national congress leader oliver tambo there were more than 
220 witnesses and the official court record contained about 30000 
pages 
van dijkhorst accepted the prosecutors allegations that the 
core of the united democratic fronts leadership was supported and 
guided by the outlawed anc the main antigovernment guerrilla 
movement

the state department expressed concern today 
about the possibility that middle eastern terrorists may be 
planning a variety of attacks perhaps against us targets in 
western europe or west africa 
a brief statement said the concern was based partly on recent 
reports of movement of terrorists from the middle east and the 
discovery of weapons shipments destined for proiranian groups in 
spain and africa 
if credible specific information or a threat to the public is 
received the department of state will provide additional 
information for travelers and other concerned parties the 
statement said 
a state department official who asked not to be identified 
said the administration has begun briefing foreign governments 
about its concerns and felt that a warning to the public also was 
appropriate 
one reason for increased fears of terrorist attack the official 
said is the seizure of 440 pounds of explosives nov 23 in 
valencia spain and the arrest of eight suspected shiite moslem 
extremists by spanish police 
a french police report said the men and explosives were headed 
for france according to spanish police at least three of the men 
are members of hezbollah an iranbacked group of extremist shiites 
based in lebanon 
the official also said there are several anniversaries coming up 
that terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out violent 
activities 
one was the still unresolved bombing of pan am flight 103 on 
dec 21 1988 over lockerbie scotland with a death toll of 259 
aboard the craft and 11 on the ground 
according to investigators evidence points to the popular front 
for the liberation of palestinegeneral command as the responsible 
group 
another december incident was the terrorist attacks on airports 
in rome and vienna two days after christmas in 1985 
the official said they also are wary because the number of 
americans in europe increases sharply during the christmas season 
todays advisory contained scant information but it followed a 
series of precautionary steps by the french government to guard 
against the possibility of terrorist attacks during the holiday 
season 
interior and justice ministers from the european community were 
meeting in france on thursday and today to coordinate efforts to 
track down a shiite militant group reportedly responsible for the 
movement of explosives from spain and to france and cyprus as well 
some french officials believe the principal aim of the group may 
be to try to dissuade france from from opposing an assault in 
lebanon on the christian forces of gen michel auon by a prosyrian 
muslim coalition 
the french action also coincides with the impending trial of one 
accused terrorist charged in bombing incidents and a hunger strike 
by a convicted terrorist who is serving a life term for trying to 
kill former iranian prime minister shahpour bakhtiar 
in the latter case involving the conviction of anis naccache 
the iranian government has repeatedly demanded that he be released

the 4yearold boy watched as the 
television news flashed a picture of jailed south african black 
leader nelson mandela 
the somewhat dated photograph did not make an impression on the 
child the second generation of mandelas family who has had to see 
him from afar 
thats how he used to look the childs mother makaziwe 
mandela said wednesday as she watched the report of a historic 
meeting between her father and south african president fw de 
klerk 
the south african press association said there was speculation 
de klerk could announce a date for mandelas release in a speech 
saturday commemorating the day of the vow a major holiday for the 
afrikaners who control the government 
although many predict mandela will be released in january his 
daughter is suspicious of the whiteled government that imprisoned 
her father in 1962 
being a south african and having grown up in south africa i 
still have the negative feeling that theyve got something up their 
sleeve she said from her modest apartment near the university of 
massachusetts where she is a fulbright scholar studying 
anthropology 
but that doesnt stop her from hoping 
as a daughter there is a little bit of excitement at least 
i am hoping said makaziwe mandela 35 who last saw her father 
earlier this year i barely know my father 
the youngest of three children from mandelas first marriage 
maki mandela was 8 years old when her father went to prison 
she saw little of him when she was growing up and she said having 
a heroic figure for a father was sometimes difficult 
seeing other children with fathers at home or hearing of some 
in the movement who had left the country with their families she 
questioned why her father allowed himself to get caught and go to 
jail 
but by her mid20s she came slowly to the realization of why 
my father had done what he had done she says 
in 1985 she decided to come to the united states to study her 
husband isaac amuah a schoolteacher later joined her and is 
pursuing postdoctoral studies they live here with their three 
young children and plan to return to south africa where she hopes 
to resume work as a community social worker 
wednesday the 71yearold mandela visited de klerk to discuss 
prospects for negotiating an end to south africas racial conflict 
the first meeting between the two 
the meeting was denounced by the farright conservative party in 
south africa and hailed by liberal leaders as a sign that de klerk 
who took office aug 15 accepts mandelas outlawed guerrilla 
movement the african national congress as playing a central role 
in any political settlement 
the black leaders daughter said shes unsure how to read the 
actions of de klerk who on oct 15 ordered the unconditional 
release of seven of mandelas anc colleagues 
it is a change whether it is a positive change or a negative 
change i think history will be the better judge she said 
but she said she doubts her father would stay free for long 
unless changes are made in the system 
unless they give him a larger role to play then i am sad to 
say that i think mandela will go back to jail because he wont sit 
quietly and accept the system that he tried to bring down she 
said 
and she said she sees no signs of sweeping changes in south 
africa along the lines of the changes in eastern europe 
the biggest challenge facing south africa is not really the 
removal of apartheid everybody already knows that apartheid is 
going away but to change the attitudes of people she said 
getting rid of those attitudes is going to be the big problem

the senate has effectively killed a 
proposed referendum that would have allowed colombians to decide 
whether the government should continue extraditing drug traffickers 
to the united states 
the issue has been eliminated interior minister carlos 
lemos said after the senate failed to reach a quorum late thursday 
to vote on legislation that would have allowed the national vote on 
extradition 
the outcome was seen as a victory for president virgilio barco 
who began battling the nations cocaine cartels after they started 
a fierce bombing and assassination campaign in a bid to stop the 
extraditions barco believed the traffickers would have intimidated 
the people in order to win the vote 
the senate vote was necessary to give the house time to approve 
the measure before the congressional session ends saturday 
the senates failure to act also will probably doom 
constitutional reforms sought by the barco government the house 
in defiance of the administration attached the referendum proposal 
to the reform legislation on dec 5 
among the proposed reforms is a plan that would allow candidates 
backed by leftist guerrillas of the april m19 movement to run for 
congress and win seats with fewer votes than normally required in 
exchange the guerrillas would lay down their arms 
m19 said it will cancel its political campaign in light of the 
legislative developments the group said in a communique that the 
government should postpone congressional elections scheduled for 
march 11 and presidential elections set for may 27 
normal elections in a country that has become unhinged would 
carry us toward greater levels of violence the communique said 
the m19 movement is the only one of colombias five leftist 
guerrilla groups to hold peace talks with the government the barco 
administration has viewed fulfilling its agreement with m19 as 
essential to persuade other groups to negotiate but administration 
officials still appeared pleased by the senates failure to vote 
while constitutional reform may be lost this session interior 
minister lemos told reporters that the sacrifice was worth it 
because it prevented the interference of drug traffickers in 
congressional decisions 
the traffickers had sought a national vote on the extraditions 
lemos has said the drug lords would intimidate voters into 
rejecting the policy if balloting on the issue were allowed 
the governments latest antidrug offensive began after 
traffickers assassinated sen luis carlos galan on aug 18 he was 
a leading presidential candidate and an antidrug crusader 
the barco administration revived its extradition policy with the 
united states as part of the crackdown and so far has sent nine 
people to the united states to face drug charges 
colombias cocaine barons responded with a bombing campaign so 
far there have been 203 attacks that have killed 188 people and 
wounded 1238 
government officials have blamed traffickers for the bombing of 
a colombian airliner on nov 27 that exploded shortly after takeoff 
from bogota killing 107 people on board officials also blame the 
drug lords for the dec 4 bombing of colombias secret police 
headquarters that killed 63 people 
a few hours after that blast news media in medellin received a 
communique that said traffickers would continue the attacks until 
congress approved a national referendum on the extradition policy

there are flags for nations states cities 
clubs and teams but until now there was no flag for the whole 
world 
heck mcdonalds even has a flag said ken roffmann one of 
two st louis men who have designed a global flag 
roffmann said thursday that he hoped to have the flag flying 
over every country of the world by the end of 1992 to remind people 
that they are all citizens of the planet earth 
seeing ourselves as one planet no divisions no boundaries 
helps us envision the new levels of cooperation and interdependence 
we need as we move into the most critical decade of human 
history roffmann said 
our survival depends on our ability to think globally and act 
locally he said 
the 3by5 global flag is midnight blue and in the center is a 
fullcolor reproduction of the full earth photograph taken by 
apollo 17 en route to the moon 
roffmann said he and his partner david fischer already had 
arranged to have the flag flying at the global forum on environment 
and development for survival and the sovietamerican citizens 
summit both in moscow next month 
they also hope to have it incorporated into world peace day 
activities around the world on dec 31 as well as the global earth 
day 1990 on april 22 
it would be marvelous if the next time we go to the moon 
instead of planting the american flag we planted this global 
flag roffmann said 
in the first few weeks of their project roffmann said about 
100 global flags have been distributed to people and organizations 
a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the flags which run 
about 50 will go to organizations involved in campaign for the 
earth a 10year campaign to create a peaceful sustainable world

customers who buy chrysler vehicles now 
there was no immediate reaction to chryslers announcement from 
general motors corp or ford motor co in the past when one of the 
big three automakers significantly boosted incentive programs 
others followed suit 
incentives carry a big risk for the automakers while cash 
rebates or lowinterest financing may boost sales the cost of the 
incentives come directly from manufacturer profits 
in late march when ford kicked off incentive programs gm and 
chrysler followed suit within four days those programs stimulated 
sales but dented profits 
todays announcement was an attempt to improve chryslers 
slumping sales 
through dec 10 the companys car and truck sales were running 
67 percent behind last years pace in recent months the decline 
has been more significant 
chrysler reported sales declines of 86 percent and 92 percent 
in october and november respectively things have been worse at 
gm where sales fell 183 percent and 189 percent for the same 
months and at ford which reported declines of 111 percent for 
october and 131 percent for november 
the big three reported their earnings were down 83 percent 
during that threemonth period from the same period a year ago the 
most profitable second quarter in auto history 
chrysler which said its incentive costs during the quarter were 
20 percent higher than in the yearago period reported a 64 
percent increase in its secondquarter profits 
since then chryslers earnings have tumbled in the third 
quarter the company reported a 771 percent decline in earnings 
without a onetime benefit from a sale of stock in mitsubishi 
motors corp some analysts are forecasting the company will barely 
remain profitable in the final quarter of 1989 
fords profits in the third quarter were down 443 percent and

the mayor of pisa signed an order friday that will 
close the leaning tower to the public from jan 7 to april 7 for 
safety reasons 
mayor giacomino granchi said officials would at least consider 
adopting safety measures that would allow a limited reopening of 
the tower to the public 
public works minister giovanni prandini has voiced concern about 
its stability 
the 180foot tower began to tilt almost from the time bonnano 
pisano started building it in 1173 because the ground shifted 
underneath it now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular but 
experts in pisa said it would not topple for at least another 
century if it continued at the same rate 
the city stands to lose money from about 800000 tourists a year 
who pay 307 apiece to climb the tower 
prandini has said the government wont reimburse pisa 
contending that visitors will still flock to see the tower and thus 
the tourist industry wont suffer he also guaranteed that the 
government will pay for the restoration work expected to cost 
about 1076 million

charges against a man accused of sexually 
molesting a 5yearold girl were thrown out after the accuracy of 
dna analysis sometimes called genetic fingerprinting was 
questioned 
the defense lawyer says the doubt raised about the reliability 
of the dna tests should trigger a reexamination of the use of such 
tests in criminal prosecutions 
this case opens up serious questions concerning dozens of 
convictions and pleas across the country that are based on dna 
typing said gene r libby attorney for a south portland man in 
a case involving the states first use of genetic coding to 
identify a suspect 
a cumberland county prosecutor withdrew the dna evidence on 
sunday and charges against kenneth mcleod alleging he committed a 
sexual act with a 5yearold girl were dropped 
in seeking to block the use of the dna evidence libby raised 
questions about the techniques used by lifecodes corp of valhalla 
ny to analyze the sample lifecodes one of only three dna 
testing laboratories in the nation deemed the dna from semen that 
was evidence of the molestation to be a match with dna in a blood 
sample taken from mcleod 
but during a pretrial hearing last week to decide whether to 
admit the results as evidence dr michael baird of lifecodes 
testified that the match was not precise because the dna sample 
from the semen was degraded from exposure to the elements 
karen wexler a spokeswoman for lifecodes defended the 
companys procedures we feel the technique is very reliable 
she said 
deputy district attorney laurence gadner declined to comment on 
the case but indicated that his office would not rule out the use 
of dna typing in future prosecutions 
what happened in the mcleod case is in no way a reflection on 
the future of dna testing and any assertions to the contrary are 
taking advantage of a unique situation gardner said 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is a complex molecule found 
mainly in the nucleus of living cells and plays a vital role in 
heredity because it contains genetic information unique to each 
individual it has been used by forensic researchers to positively 
identify suspects in criminal cases 
developed in england dna typing was accepted as evidence for 
the first time in this country last year in a criminal trial in 
florida since then dna evidence has been used in at least 100 
criminal cases mostly rape and murder prosecutions in 23 states 
similar quality control problems at lifecodes led a court in new 
york to reject part of a dna test as evidence in a murder trial 
last year lifecodes subsequently said it had solved its quality 
control problems

two former executives of norden systems 
today admitted they conspired to obtain confidential defense 
department bid information on a lucrative marine corps contract 
james e rapinac a former senior vice president and cj 
richardson a former marketing official pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy to defraud the government and convert government 
property 
the two acknowledged that they conspired in 1987 to pay defense 
consultant thomas muldoon 49500 to obtain the information about 
the contract for a radar command and control system valued at up to 
150 million 
muldoon who was convicted thursday of participating in a 
separate bribery scheme obtained the information from fellow 
defense consultant mark saunders according to court papers filed 
by prosecutors 
saunders who has not been charged in the continuing 
investigation of pentagon procurement fraud is alleged to have 
obtained the bid information from former navy procurement official 
george stone stone has not yet been charged in the investigation 
nicknamed operation ill wind 
the pleas by rapinac and richardson were accepted by us 
district judge claude m hilton who scheduled sentencing for march 
9 both defendants could receive up to five years imprisonment and 
be fined as much as 250000 
in a statement rapinac said while i offer no excuses for my 
actions i do believe the defense acquisition process is conducive 
to abuses 
earlier in the day hilton sentenced two former executives of 
another defense firm whittaker corp on their guilty pleas to 
bribery charges in an unrelated scheme 
scott m lamberth 59 a former vice president of a whittaker 
subsidiary was ordered to serve 10 months in prison and fined 
10000 for his role in a scheme to funnel more than 80000 to a 
pentagon procurement official 
also sentenced was john franklin van tassel a former whittaker 
employee who received a threemonth term in a halfway house for 
his role in the scheme van tassel who headed the californiabased 
defense firms fayetteville ark operation was also fined 3000 
both men had pleaded guilty sept 26 to bribery charges in 
connection with a scheme to funnel money to former marine corps 
contracting official jack a sherman 
the bribes were funneled through muldoon who was convicted 
thursday of eight charges including bribery and conspiracy both 
lamberth and van tassel testified as prosecution witnesses against 
muldoon 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica acknowledged that both 
men had cooperated with the governments investigation of pentagon 
procurement fraud nicknamed operation ill wind 
aronica said van tassel played a minor role in the scheme 
before he was sentenced lamberth urged hilton to show leniency for 
van tassel who he said only acted as a good trouper who carried 
out my orders 
lamberth and van tassel were executives of lee 
telecommunications which was taken over by whittaker in 1986 
lamberth was a vice president and van tassel was head of 
whittakers arkansas operation 
van tassel now lives in colorado springs colo and lamberth 
lives near durango colo 
another former whittaker executive leonard ingram was 
acquitted of all bribery and conspiracy charges against him by the 
same jury that convicted muldoon 
the jurys verdict against muldoon followed more than two days 
of testimony including tape recordings of wiretapped conversations 
involving muldoon company officials and other defense consultants 
ingram testified he made repeated protests to lamberth about the 
bribery scheme but was told to mind his own business 
lamberth testified ingram did object but later stopped the 
testimony was offered to try to convince jurors that ingram 
eventually acquiesced 
ill wind blew itself out ingrams lawyer marcus topel 
said after the verdict in their zeal to broaden this 
investigation prosecutors put too much reliance on the 
credibility of their informants 
hilton scheduled muldoons sentencing for feb 16 he faces a 
possible 70year prison term and a maximum fine of 104 million 
during the trial sherman testified he negotiated to receive 
more than 80000 worth of bribes in return for helping lee 
telecommunications get marine corps electronic contracts 
sherman said muldoon and two other defense consultants who also 
testified as government witnesses served as conduits for the 
payments muldoon and he split the bribe money with sherman taking 
a third 
sherman who is serving an 18month prison term after pleading 
guilty to a separate scheme recalled receiving 25000 from 
muldoon 
ingram 51 of huntsville ala was a stockholder and vice 
president of lee telecommunications he became a vice president of 
whittaker command and control systems after the 1986 takeover 
the whittaker subsidiary pleaded guilty to bribery and 
conspiracy and paid 35 million in penalties 
more than 25 individuals and four corporations have been 
convicted in the continuing investigation 
in the only other trial a former teledyne electronics executive 
was acquitted last spring during a trial at which two of his 
colleagues were convicted for their roles in the influencepeddling 
scandal

a state lawmaker has proposed a 1 fine 
for anyone who beats up a person who burns or desecrates american 
or state flags 
rep joseph petrarca a democrat introduced the legislation 
earlier this week 
the 1 fine would replace the normal penalties for assault or 
aggravated assault a person convicted of aggravated assault could 
be sentenced to 10 years in jail and fined 25000 
petrarca said he offered the bill because the house was 
unwilling to seek a constitutional amendment to punish flag burners 
since so many of our neighbors and family members have made 
huge sacrifices to protect it on foreign battlefields sometimes 
with their lives i feel desecrating the flag is a matter to be 
taken extremely seriously petrarca said in a statement 
the fate of the bill is uncertain 
i cant imagine this is going to go anywhere rep allen 
kukovich the democrats policy chairman told the philadelphia 
inquirer but who knows there are philistines everywhere i 
guess 
kukovich said such bills make the house of representatives a 
laughingstock

president bush pressed the real thing when 
he switched on the national christmas tree spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said friday but he hesitated when asked the same 
question about former president reagan 
i better let that go fitzwater said when asked if reagan 
had used a phony button in the years that he lit the tree from the 
safety of a white house balcony several hundred yards from the 
tree 
is your nonanswer an answer he was asked 
well sort of responded fitzwater who served as press 
spokesman to reagan before taking on the same assignment with bush 
asked about this years ceremony fitzwater asserted without 
hesitation last night was the real thing 
bush lit the 35foot national tree on thursday night in person 
at a public outdoor ceremony on the ellipse during his eight years 
in office reagan stayed within the white house complex for the 
ceremony supposedly lighting the christmas tree by remote control 
fitzwater was pressed about speculation that the button reagan 
pushed each year was not attached to anything and that a national 
park service officer actually lit the tree from the site 
i think thats a question for mark weinberg fitzwater said 
referring to the current press spokesman in reagans california 
office 
however weinberg made it clear he didnt want to get into 
details of the situation 
all i know is when the president pushed the button the tree 
lighted up weinberg said in a telephone interview

mikhail s gorbachev and andrei d sakharov shared 
little personally except a mutual respect and a commitment to 
change 
as they went before the nation in a parliamentary session this 
week they could not have appeared more different gorbachev at 
the pinnacle of his power was robust and selfconfident sakharov 
was stooped and stammering 
and yet the times dictated that they work together and it was 
sakharovs relationship to the soviet president that defined his 
role in an era of reform 
it was a sign of the program of change that sakharov long had 
urged and gorbachev instituted that soviets could watch the two men 
struggle with each other at the congress of peoples deputies 
parliament 
sakharov died thursday evening in his study preparing to 
challenge gorbachev once more on the political supremacy of the 
communist party that gorbachev leads 
its a great loss gorbachev said friday during a break in 
the congress of peoples deputies where sakharov had served as a 
parliamentarian during this time of perestroika academician 
sakharov had his mission his role and that we all understood he 
was a man of conviction and sincerity he was not some sort of 
political intriguer 
the soviet public liked and respected sakharov at least as much 
as gorbachev an unscientific poll conducted by the weekly 
arguments and facts in october found sakharov the countrys most 
popular politician more popular than gorbachev 
gorbachev freed sakharov from the exile in the industrial city 
of gorky imposed by leonid i brezhnev and withdrew soviet 
soldiers from afghanistan it was sakharovs criticism of the 
intervention into afghanistan 10 years ago that led to his exile in 
gorky 
even though sakharov owed his return to moscow from the living 
hell of isolation forcefeedings and surveillance in gorky 
gorbachev never dominated sakharov 
sakharov spoke out in favor of the reforms gorbachev instituted 
because they matched his own ideals but in the past several months 
had become increasingly critical of the pace of the reform and 
gorbachevs accumulation of power 
he said the country had no alternative to gorbachevs leadership 
but prodded the soviet president to push harder the day he died 
he told a group of likeminded deputies that the soviet 
leaderships hesitancy to press more radical reform was leading the 
country to catastrophe 
sakharov told the first congress in junei personally respect 
mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev very much but it is dangerous to 
give so much power even to the initiator of perestroika 
sakharov continually challenged gorbachev at the congress but 
was no match as a public speaker to the vigorous and selfconfident 
president sakharov stammered rambled and spoke in a highpitched 
voice often losing his audience even when it supported him 
he often pressed issues that a smarter politician would have 
left alone deputies hounded him in june for allegations that the 
soviet military had hunted down and killed its own soldiers in 
afghanistan rather than risk their captured by rebels 
in recently released excerpts of a book to be published next 
year sakharov said that gorbachev usually greeted him with a smile 
that was halfkindly halfcondescending 
even when gorbachev tried to silence him sakharov insisted on 
being heard 
their last exchange was shown to millions of soviets on live tv 
on tuesday the opening day of the congress winter session 
gorbachev granted sakharov the right to speak after having 
denied it to a previous deputy but cut him off abruptly when he 
began challenging the communist partys grip on power 
sakharov handed gorbachev a stack of telegrams in support of his 
position and the soviet leader retorted you come to me i will 
give you three files of telegrams 
even though gorbachev called sakharov in exile in december 1986 
to tell him he could return to moscow the two did not meet until 
more than a year later jan 15 1988 
typically sakharov handed gorbachev a list of 200 prisoners 
still held for their political beliefs

lawmakers controlled by gen manuel 
antonio noriega today named him head of the government and granted 
him sweeping powers saying they took the action to confront a 
state of war because of us sanctions 
the unanimous resolution by the 510member peoples assembly 
which the defense forces chief picked said noreiga was being 
designated maximum leader for national liberation 
the move formally gives noriega greater powers than provisional 
president francisco rodriguez a situation that already existed de 
facto 
several thousand noriega supporters surrounded the assembly as 
it met and cheered as the resolution passed 
the republic of panama is declared to be in a state of war 
while the aggression lasts said the resolution to confront 
this aggression the job of chief of government of panama is hereby 
created and manuel antonio noriega is designated to carry out 
these responsibilities as maximum leader for national liberation 
the resolution gave noriega the power to appoint public 
officials control foreign relations convoke the assembly and 
make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen 
circumstance that affect the national life and the interests of the 
country 
asked about the move us deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger told reporters in washington this ia charade and 
nonsense as far as we are concerned at least there is no 
government in panama anyway 
isaac chandeck a delegate from the panama city suburb of ancon 
predicted thursday that the assembly would give noriega the post 
rodriguez a noriega friend since high school was picked as 
president after noriega halted votecounting in a popular election 
in may backed the general for the new post thursday 
noriega annulled returns from the may 7 vote when they showed 
the opposition winning by a landslide the move also blocked the 
election of a new national assembly so noriega picked a new 
legislative body 
noriega is wanted in the united states on federal 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges the united states 
has been trying to oust him with economic sanctions and diplomatic 
pressure 
rodriguez told the assembly thursday that the united states had 
declared war on all panamanians with its economic sanctions 
it is not noriega they want to do away with rodriguez said 
they want to do away with our national capacity to be 
independent 
noriega has weathered more than a year of the sanctions 
opposition demonstrations and two attempted coups from inside the 
defense forces 
as chief executive noriega would hold the same title as that of 
dictator omar torrijos who negotiated treaties with the united 
states to transfer the panama canal to panamanian control at the 
end of the century and close down us military installations 
noriega says the united states is trying to force his ouster 
because it wants to renege on the treaties 
in another move against the united states chandeck said he will 
be distributing wanted posters for two us generals 
chandeck has filed charges of destroying panamanian property 
against gen marc cisneros commander of us army south and gen 
maxwell thurman head of the us southern command that includes 
all us military forces in latin america 
the generals were charged in ancon chandecks constituency 
they were accused of destroying public property by driving armored 
personnel carriers on public roads and by other actions 
the us military twice rejected court summons for cisneros and 
thurman us officials offered in one letter the courtesy of 
facilitating the transfer of custody of selected fugitives 
pending drugtrafficking charges in the united states that was a 
reference to noriega and the charges against him 
borough officials did not respond to the tongueincheek offer 
instead they issued an arrest warrant for cisneros and thurman 
chandeck said he now plans to distribute wanted posters of 
cisneros and thurman all over the country 
we will have their pictures and a big wanted sign on top 
he said

ignoring demonstrators chanting shame shame 
shame the metropolitan transportation authority voted friday to 
raise its bus and subway fares 15 cents to 115 
in addition to the first subway fare hike in four years the mta 
board approved increases averaging 15 percent for the commuter 
trains and express buses that serve the citys outer boroughs and 
suburbs 
no one likes a fare increase but it does cost money to get 
things done explained mta chairman robert kiley service is 
getting better 
the average fare increase of 15 percent compared favorably with 
a 22 percent increase in the cost of living since the last hike he 
said 
dozens of protesters including a contingent of guardian angels 
circled outside the mta offices in manhattan inside the boards 
session was punctuated by shouts of your stealing food out of 
peoples mouths and let the people vote on the fare 
when board member herbert j libert asked kiley if the 
demonstrators could be quieted kiley replied this will be a 
test of your attention span herb 
guards threw one signcarrying demonstrator out of the room 
after he approached the table where board members were sitting 
the new fares take effect jan 1 
the ta had proposed boosting bus and subway fares to 125 with 
discount packages of 18 tokens for 20 but that was hooted down at 
public hearings 
connecticut officials said this week they would veto the fare 
increase for metronorth trains running from that state into new 
york 
if connecticut fails to make us whole we would put on a level 
of service for connecticut that would reflect that kiley said 
he said about 77 million in cuts for connecticut service would 
be necessary if state officials persist in their veto and refuse to 
increase the states direct subsidy to metronorth commuter 
railroad 
the new fares include increasing long island rail road and 
metronorth fares 15 percent to 20 percent an offpeak 10trip 
ticket will be sold at 10 percent off the regular fare and there 
will be offpeak family fares under which children riding with 
a parent pay 50 cents a ride the 1 penalty for buying tickets on 
the train will be increased to 2

proof that peace is breaking out all 
over comes this weekend with the inspection of a topsecret star 
wars laser lab by soviet scientists 
the soviets wont be shown everything as much of the project 
remains secret the pentagon described the visit as a trial to 
evaluate a proposed space defense treaty 
the confidencebuilding tours are designed to show how 
inspections of strategic defense initiative research facilities 
would work under the treaty recently proposed by the united states 
in geneva the pentagon said 
the visit will offer soviet experts an opportunity to see how 
one of the usproposed measures visits to laboratories would 
work in practice the pentagon said other proposals include data 
exchanges and observation of tests 
ten scientists led by ambassador yuri nazarkin head of the 
soviet delegation to the nuclear and space talks will be briefed 
saturday at the trw plant regarding the planned spacebased 
antimissile system pentagon officials said 
the delegation will visit a second sdi research facility at los 
alamos nm on monday and tuesday the pentagon said 
the soviets were scheduled to arrive friday at el toro marine 
corps air station north of san clemente ambassador david j smith 
chief us negotiator for the nuclear and space talks will 
accompany the delegation 
at the trw lab near san clemente the soviets will investigate 
the alpha laser facility it is the centerpiece of the zenith star 
project which the pentagon hopes will prove the viability of using 
spacebased lasers to shoot down hostile missiles or satellites 
the hydrogen fluoride laser uses highcombustion fuels to create 
energy which then is amplified by mirrors and resonant chambers 
intended to create a concentrated beam of light capable of 
destroying vehicles in space 
zenith star is the name for a 50ton 80footlong carrier for 
the alpha laser 
in los alamos the soviet team will be briefed on the evolution 
of us work on neutral particle beam technology the pentagon said 
the scientists will view the bear neutral particle beam payload 
which was launched into space and recovered in july 1989 and also 
will see the device operate in the lab

a county commissioner and three others were 
convicted of illegally making and selling equipment used to 
descramble paytv channels a case a defense attorney said was the 
first of its type in the nation 
dale county commissioner billy clyde herring and his brother 
bennie dean herring were convicted thursday of three counts each 
of conspiracy to manufacture assemble possess and sell video 
deciphers modified to receive scrambled television signals on 
premium pay channels without authorization 
the herring brothers and two others were convicted under a 1968 
federal wiretap law that was amended by congress in 1986 to include 
electronic communications 
defense attorneys george beck and jim parkman said their clients 
sold the devices openly and did not know the amended wiretap law 
applied to descrambling the defense contended the law was intended 
to apply to bugging devices not satellite transmission receivers 
a new federal law which went on the books in january 
specifically covers descrambling the four were charged with 
selling descrambling equipment in december 1987 and june 1988 
before the new antidescrambling law was passed 
beck said the prosecution was the first against descrambling of 
paytv channels using the federal wiretap law us attorney jim 
wilson could not confirm that but said it is one of the first 
were naturally disappointed with the verdict beck said 
we dont think the defendants had sufficient notice that what 
they are accused of was a violation of the wiretap statute 
in addition to the herrings convictions ron mills 39 of 
goshen was convicted of two counts of conspiracy and dee dee bell 
35 of ariton was convicted of one count bennie herring owns 
tristate satellite in brundidge and the other three worked for 
him 
us district judge truman hobbs did not set a sentencing date 
the four remain free on 5000 bond apiece each defendant could

king county officials are considering a proposal 
that could bring growth in the nations hottest housing market to a 
grinding halt 
the proposal unveiled thursday by county councilman ron sims 
would block housing construction in unincorporated king county 
until after adequate roads schools and other services are built 
sims and cosponsor councilwoman cynthia sullivan said the 
proposal aims to shift the power to make land use decisions to the 
public essentially giving them veto rights over developments if 
their neighborhoods are being overwhelmed by growth 
in may seattle voters adopted limits on downtown growth in one 
of the citys first demonstrations of discontent with the fast pace 
of development 
if the county council approves the measure it would put an 
amendment of the councils charter on the nov 6 1990 general 
election ballot 
the proposed amendment reads no county officials shall have 
the authority to approve private development where facilities will 
not be adequate unless an emergency is found to exist 
that would eliminate the discretion county officials have to 
approve development plans when services are not in place 
sims listed roads sewers water schools open space and 
surface water drainage as key services that would have to be in 
place before ground is broken for a project 
were taking away the permissiveness that has allowed growth 
to occur before we have the infrastructure to support it sims 
said he said he would formally introduce the ordinance at mondays 
council meeting 
a simple majority on the ninemember council is needed for 
approval 
what it does is require communities to pay as they grow and 
thats something weve been promoting for over a year said newly 
elected council member brian derdowski a slowgrowth activist 
developers criticized the measure as a poorly drafted 
ordinance that fails to define what is adequate service 
if this ordinance passes housing prices will skyrocket 
said bill sherman president of the seattle master builders 
association 
sims said a later ordinance would define which services would be 
included and what would be considered adequate 
the measure comes as the median cost of a singlefamily home in 
the seattle area is rising at 237 percent a year up from 88900 
to 110000 in the past year the fastest pace in the nation 
according to the national association of realtors 
the population is also swelling with an estimated 650000 more 
people expected by 2020 
the 2128squaremile county has about 14 million residents 
about 31 percent of washington states population incorporated 
areas include seattle and its suburbs with a total of about 1 
million people much of the eastern part of the county is 
unincorporated 
the county has grown by about 190000 people during the past 
decade with newcomers accounting for about half the increase 
seattle was named the nations most liveable city this year by 
the places rated almanac in part because of its affordable real 
estate

the writer was an associated press correspondent 
in moscow during the height of andrei d sakharovs dissident 
activities in the 1970s 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
andrei d sakharov remained free during his toughest years as a 
dissident because he held a unique position in soviet society that 
stymied official attempts to silence or expel him 
because of his toplevel scientific reputation and the huge 
support he received from the west authorities feared that jailing 
sakharov could threaten kremlin leader leonid i brezhnevs 
struggle to forge a 1970s detente with the united states 
soviet authorities sometimes dealt with troublesome dissidents 
by expelling them from the country but because sakharov was a key 
developer of the soviet hydrogen bomb the securityobsessed 
bureaucracy couldnt imagine that course either once abroad 
officials feared sakharov could divulge critical soviet nuclear 
secrets 
meanwhile the honors sakharov won for his scientific work and 
his membership in the soviet academy of sciences gave him 
privileges that set him far apart from other dissidents who were 
often impoverished and littleknown 
foreign visitors including parliament members and diplomats 
came frequently to sakharovs apartment in a prestigious area of 
downtown moscow as a result of his academy membership the 
physicist enjoyed a hefty salary and the use of chauffeured cars 
even as he suffered surveillance by the kgb and vilification in the 
official press 
yet the threatening police presence around him and the official 
denunciations still put pressures on sakharov that required 
substantial personal courage his colleagues in the academy of 
sciences frequently castigated him in public although they never 
voted him out of membership and he often received threatening 
letters 
and he never knew when his espousing of human rights and 
environmental causes might lead to the abrupt end of his 
privileges and his fall into the world of brutal repression where 
many other dissidents lived 
until he was banished to the city of gorky in 1980 suffering 
many of the horrors that other dissidents faced sakharovs special 
status made it natural for him to become a central figure in the 
dissident movement in moscow dissidents felt that if they could 
only contact sakharov and get him to speak for them they would 
acquire a measure of safety from persecution 
sakharov in reality could offer them little protection but he 
rarely failed to welcome them dissidents from all over the nation 
sometimes 15 or 20 at a time squeezed into his tworoom apartment 
on chkalova street in moscow to beseech him for help and to meet 
with western reporters 
the booklined disorderly apartment was usually filled with the 
smell of tea brewing in the kitchen as many as seven members of 
the sakharov family who slept at night on sofas and the floor 
milled around with the visiting dissidents foreign camera crews 
and foreign supporters 
yelena bonner sakharovs outspoken wife presided over the 
chaos sometimes giving interviews herself or jumping in to answer 
a question asked of sakharov 
the telephone rang constantly authorities at times cut off his 
international phone service but sakharov usually was able to make 
and receive calls within moscow and often relayed messages from one 
dissident to another sakharovs mail service functioned too 
bringing him as many as 20 appeals for help a week from dissidents 
throughout the soviet union 
sakharov believed the mail was read and the phone calls 
monitored by authorities but felt he had little to fear because he 
made no secret of his dissident activities 
along with his academy of sciences salary of 530 rubles a month 
nearly three times that of the average soviet worker sakharov 
had other privileges stemming from his three hero of the soviet 
union awards for his scientific work by showing a special card 
he could ride buses and subways for free get priority airline and 
train tickets and go to the head of lines at stores and theaters 
he traveled occasionally sometimes attending the trials of 
dissidents in other cities 
yet despite his special status sakharov suffered many 
pressures frail in appearance he often seemed stung and 
despairing after a new press attack or a threatening anonymous 
phone call when he visited a foreign diplomat or journalist kgb 
agents would tail him by car there were rumors the neighbors in 
his apartment building had been recruited to spy on him 
yet sakharov never seemed interested in leaving the country or 
toning down his dissident activities 
i have never considered emigrating not for one minute it 
never entered my head he said in 1977 the year president jimmy 
carter sent him a strong letter of support that gave him a new 
measure of safety 
sakharovs freedom did not last indefinitely in 1980 the 
authorities finally stripped him of his official honors and then 
exiled him for six years to gorky a city closed to foreigners 
there sakharov was almost entirely isolated from the outside world 
and subjected to a far higher level of threats and harassment than 
he ever experienced in moscow sakharov staged hunger strikes in 
protest the authorities responded with painful forcefeeding 
according to his wife a doctor in gorky once told him we 
wont let you die but we will make you an invalid 
but the state never jailed him and never expelled him from the 
scientific community an enduring sign of sakharovs special role 
in soviet life

some americans and other foreigners 
are considering leaving and wouldbe visitors are canceling trips 
amid fears of terrorism following the failed bid to overthrow 
president corazon aquino 
its a very critical situation said a travel agent who 
spoke on condition of anonymity if this goes on americans will 
leave this country the rebels have accomplished what they would 
want to do create panic 
us diplomats say there has been no exodus of foreigners who 
included about 100000 americans since mutineers in the military 
staged a nineday coup attempt that started dec 1 
but rumors of a new attempt are sweeping the city travel agents 
and other sources in the foreign community say many foreigners have 
lost confidence in the aquino government and plan to leave if the 
situation deteriorates 
travel agents said they are swamped with requests for opendated 
airline tickets from worried foreigners as well as wealthy 
filipinos none of the agents wanted to be quoted by name for fear 
of being accused of hurting the travel industry 
wealthy filipinos are more scared they are frantic said an 
american travel agent americans are a little bit more sturdy 
they are not leaving now but they are preparing to leave they want 
to be able to get out of the airport until they feel danger is 
over 
the recent coup attempt shook the foreign community more than 
the previous five during the aquino administration because much of 
the fighting occurred in makati the financial district where 
thousands of foreigners live 
hundreds of tourists and business travelers including at least 
164 americans were trapped for four days during fierce fighting in 
the district 
also president bushs decision to order us war jets to 
support government troops raised fears of reprisals against 
americans on thursday unidentified assailants fired two grenades 
into a us government housing area the attack caused no injuries 
but reinforced fears that foreigners were no longer safe 
they are not very happy with the situation another travel 
agent said they worry that theres going to be a coup theres 
not going to be one there will be terrorist attacks they feel 
they are not very safe going out into the streets or shopping they 
feel very insecure 
although careful not to play up the strains the us embassy 
has made available stress counseling for those either shaken by 
the coup attempt or nervous about the possibility of another one 
some people have left temporarily for hong kong or other 
neigboring countries but travel agents are not overjoyed by the 
extra business 
its not the kind of business i like because if they leave for 
good then it would pull business downward said one travel 
agent if they get too panicky that means a loss of corporate 
revenues 
us officials have been reviewing their procedures for helping 
american nationals leave the country in case of an emergency 
several other expatriate organizations including the 
philippineamerican chamber of commerce have set up networks to 
keep foreigners informed of the situation 
meanwhile tourist officials say wouldbe visitors are canceling 
trips 
tourism secretary peter garrucho said the travel industry may 
lose up to 550 million in gross earnings next year because of 
estimates that up to 500000 prospective tourists will travel 
elsewhere 
one travel agent said 500 of 6000 delegates who earlier 
confirmed they would attend an international medical convention 
here in february already have backed out 
hotel managers who had been turning away guests a month ago 
said occupancy in some fivestar establishments has dropped as low 
as 29 percent 
occupancy at the countrys most luxurious hotels manila hotel 
and westin philippine plaza has dropped by 50 percent managers

stripping in the aisles of filenes basement an 
intricate art perfected by diehard bargain hunters over the years 
will pass into history when the store builds womens dressing rooms 
in february 
the state announced friday that the store had agreed to build 
the dressing rooms in response to two complaints filed with the 
states commission against discrimination 
filenes basement has long had a nationwide reputation as a 
place for savvy shoppers to stop on tours of the historic city the 
stores fame was augmented during the 1988 presidential campaign 
when voters learned candidate gov michael s dukakis bought his 
suits there 
but the store has no changing rooms for women although men have 
dressing rooms 
jeannemarie cabe one of the women who lodged a complaint said 
friday she was outraged when she learned men had a place to change 
while women had to wriggle in and out of clothes in the aisles 
one christmas she had to return a number of items that didnt 
fit i was really getting mad waiting in line and thinking men 
dont have to do this said cabe 
she filed her complaint in 1988 two years after janet boyle 
hugill brought her complaint 
hugill also was surprised to learn men had a dressing room she 
filed her complaint after trying to buy a bathing suit it was not 
returnable so she couldnt take it home to try on an employee 
told her about the facilities for men 
i had no idea there were mens dressing rooms she said 
obviously i thought that was not right 
mcad commissioner kathleen allen whose office worked out the 
agreement with filenes basement said she has friends who refuse 
to shop at the store because theres no place to try on clothes 
i dont know why anyone has not filed a complaint before 
allen said its one of those insults women maybe thought they 
had to ignore and move onto the next place 
filenes basement inc based in boston has 25 stores in the 
northeast said jim anathan the companys president all the other 
stores have changing rooms for women 
the boston store once had a changing room that was removed to 
make way for customers and merchandise we really found we 
couldnt accommodate the velocity and the traffic down there 
anathan said 
he pointed out the new room will be small only about 140 
square feet its probably going to create more problems for us 
than solutions he said 
an informal survey of women combing the racks at filenes on 
friday elicited cries of wonderful from basement patrons 
kay smith a filenes basement shopper for 25 years said she 
wont miss the changing technique she has perfected over the years 
you pick up a raincoat if you havent worn a coat and 
change under that without a bit of skin showing smith said 
the news even brought sighs of relief from men including one 
who is used to the sight of women in various states of undress 
tony maccarro a bartender at a boston striptease club who was 
buying bluejeans for his daughter said he finds it embarrassing to 
see women changing in the aisles theres certain things for 
certain places he said

the crew of the nuclearpowered 
submarine tennessee successfully launched its third trident 2 
missile in 11 days friday freeing up 950 million that congress 
had withheld from the program because of early test failures 
the success also put the navys newest deadliest weapon on 
track for operational deployment at sea in march 
a nice safe easy launch straight down through the 
countdown said vice adm roger f bacon commander of the 
atlantic submarine fleet who observed the test 50 miles off the 
florida coast 
bacon said the launch demonstrated that engineers have overcome 
nozzle design problems that caused the explosive failure of two of 
the first three undersea tests in march and august 
because of the failures congress froze all but 250 million of 
the l2 billion appropriated for the trident 2 program in fiscal 
year 1990 congress stipulated the funds would be released when the 
navy logged three successes of the redesigned missile 
that requirement was met when the third straight success was 
registered friday said lt greg smith navy spokesman 
three more submarine testfirings are planned in january and 
february before the tennessee goes on operational patrol with 24 of 
the powerful missiles each capable of delivering as many as 12 
nuclear wearheads to individual targets bacon said 
twentyfour trident 2 submarines are planned 
the two early failures set the program back missing the 
original november operational date march was set as the new target 
after the faulty nozzle system was redesigned 
greenpeace antinuclear protesters were not on the scene friday 
as the submerged submarine unleashed the 44foot 265million 
missile which propelled a dummy warhead package to an undisclosed 
ocean target more than 4000 miles down the atlantic tracking range 
a large greenpeace vessel was badly damaged dec 4 when a navy 
ship rammed it to keep it out of the launch safety zone a smaller 
sailboat kept its distance as the protesters staged a silent vigil 
during a launch wednesday 
shannon fagan a greenpeace spokeswoman said the organization 
now would take its fight to congress in an effort to kill the 
trident 2 program

a decisive election victory gives the new 
civilian government vital leverage on gen augusto pinochet who 
will keep command of the army after leaving the presidency but the 
road ahead is not smooth 
presidentelect patricio aylwin acknowledges he must build 
careful alliances with conservatives to achieve democratic reforms 
sought by his centerleft alliance 
also pinochet appears at least indirectly strengthened in his 
claim to leadership of the politial right 
aylwin won 552 percent of the vote for president thursday 
nearly twice the 294 percent of progovernment candidate hernan 
buchi a third candidate entrepreneur francisco errazuriz got 
only 154 percent according to virtually complete returns released 
friday 
the 17party coalition aylwin represents won a majority in the 
120member house of deputies and 22 of the 38 elected senate seats 
the consitution pinochets government wrote in 1980 however 
allows it to appoint up to 10 more senators 
his own impressive victory and the especially good showing of 
his christian demcratic party give aylwin a strong mandate 
said arturo valenzuela latin american studies director at 
georgetown university in washington 
thursdays vote demonstrates that aylwin has broadbased 
support which pinochet does not valenzuela said in an interview 
in santiago where he witnessed the election he can say look 
i got 55 percent you only got 43 percent 
pinochet won 43 percent of the vote in october 1988 on a 
referendum proposal to extend his presidency to 1997 
he lost the referendum and was forced to call the elections but 
pinochets showing was much stronger than buchis in the 
presidential race 
for the right pinochet is the most powerful figure 
potentially valenzuela said 
the fiercely anticommunist general 74 seized power in 1973 
overthrowing elected president salvador allende an avowed marxist 
who died in the coup he is to relinquish the presidency march 11 
but has said he will remain as commander of the 60000man army 
a special clause in the constitution allows him to keep the job 
until 1998 from the army command directly across santiagos main 
boulevard from the presidential palace he plans to lead the 
military in its role as watchdog of his 1980 constitution 
pinochet also has hinted occasionally that he may return to 
politics because the general says chileans will come to miss 
his authoritarian leadership 
aylwins platform includes several democratic changes in the 
constitution and in special laws but majorities of up to 
twothirds are needed to pass them 
that his coalition failed to achieve such dominance is due 
largely to complicated electoral laws written by the junta that 
caused many leftist candidates to lose even when they got more 
votes than rightist opponents 
parties of the left have considerable influence in powerful 
labor groups and aylwin will need to make sure they do not feel 
disenfranchized as he tries to reach accommodation with 
conservatives 
at a news conference friday the presidentelect seemed well 
aware of his delicate position he denied any intention of setting 
his christian democrats apart from the alliance as a means of 
wooing moderate rightists known to dislike pinochet 
the alliance will continue to work as a team aylwin said 
and he will follow a path of broad consensus between now and 
march 11 
he spoke of the peaceful manner in which chileans are returning 
to civilian government and declared in this country the 
commitment toward moderation prevails

twentythree koreans on friday were 
tearfully reunited with their relatives after arriving from the 
soviet island of sakhalin where japan sent them to work during 
world war ii 
the koreans ranging in age from 57 to 83 hugged relatives and 
shed tears when they arrived at seouls kimpo international airport 
for their first visit they are among thousands sent to labor on 
sakhalin when the island was under japanese control the soviets 
took it over in the closing days of the war in 1945 when korea was 
liberated from japans colonial rule 
this was the first batch of koreans on sakhalin who have visited 
south korea under a program initiated in july by south korean and 
japanese red cross officials 
the 23 koreans will return to the soviet territory after winding 
up an officiallysponsored twoweek stay in south korea 
about 4000 korean wartime survivors live on the island in 
addition to more than 30000 sakhalin koreans of the second or 
third generation 
south korea had urged the soviet union to establish official 
channels to help the koreans on sakhalin visit their homeland since 
the communist superpower permitted limited home visits by the 
sakhalin koreans in 1986 
although south korea has no diplomatic relations with the soviet 
union the two countries have sharply improved trade and other 
relations in recent years 
sakhalin a narrow 580milelong island lies about 40 miles 
north of japans northernmost island of hokkaido and straddles the 
soviet mainland

the white house suggested friday that 
continued soviet adherence to a centralized planning course 
could jeopardize some economic incentives president bush offered 
mikhail s gorbachev 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater cited recent criticism 
in the soviet congress of peoples deputies of gorbachevs 
perestroika or restructuring and moves toward keeping multiyear 
planning methods 
were disappointed that they appear to be on a centralized 
planning course fitzwater said 
bush outlined a number of economic opportunities for the 
soviet union when he met earlier this month with gorbachev at 
malta including a promise to support moscows bid for observer 
status in the general agreement on tariffs and trade an 
international organization that establishes trading rules 
fitzwater said 
a good deal of the progress under those initiatives requires 
that they move toward market pricing toward market economics 
fitzwater said this is not particularly encouraging for their 
participation in world economic bodies and so we are 
disappointed

president bush on friday signed into law new 
rules for the scandalwracked department of housing and urban 
development saying the regulations will help eliminate flaws that 
allowed the agency to be abused for political purposes or 
personal gain 
the legislation approved by a voice vote in both the senate and 
house grew out of revelations of fraud influencepeddling and 
political favoritism at hud during the reagan administration 
the multibilliondollar scandal has been the subject of 
congressional and criminal investigations 
bush said the measure would improve program management and 
financial accountability at hud and make that departments programs 
less susceptible to waste fraud abuse and political influence 
the bill requires consultants and lobbyists working on hud 
programs to register with the department and identify their clients 
and fees they receive recipients of hud grants would have to 
report their use of consultants and lobbyists 
hud would be required to publish notices of funding 
availability including waivers of regulations as a way to prevent 
subsidy awards based on insider information the measure also 
imposes strict limitations on the use of discretionary funds by hud 
bush said in a statement that never again must we let the 
programs of hud or any other agency be abused for political 
purposes or personal gain 
the law he said represents a bispartisan approach to 
correcting many of huds past problems and helping to ensure that 
in the future that department will better serve those who depend on 
its programs 
other provisions 
create a hud chief financial officers position as well as a 
comptroller of the federal housing administration to oversee 
financial management 
apply new restrictions on the section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program which provided subsidies for renovating lowincome housing 
that were at the heart of evidence of influencepeddling and 
political favoritism in the hud scandals 
make it illegal for consultants to sell their influence in 
securing housing subsidies for a contingent fee or a perunit fee 
as occurred during the reagan administration 
strengthen the secretarys ability to enforce new hud laws with 
civil fines against developers consultants applicants and 
mortgage lenders it would restrict the secretarys ability to use 
discretion in awarding housing assistance

industrial production was little changed in 
november despite rebounding from a major strike and a devestating 
earthquake the government said friday in a report that showed 
spreading economic sluggishness 
many economists said the weak 01 percent gain in output the 
first in three months accompanied by moderating inflation 
suggests the federal reserve board should permit another drop in 
shortterm interest rates to stimulate the economy 
manufacturing production continues to slow its not 
collapsing but it is slowing and i think the fed is sensing that 
it has some type of leeway to ease rates said john silvia an 
economist with kemper financial services in chicago 
in its report friday on industrial production the fed 
attributed the gain to a rebound from the boeing co strike which 
ended in late november and from the lingering effects in the 
computer and related industries from the san francisco bayarea 
earthquake in october when output had slumped 06 percent 
excluding the impact of these events the total index would 
have been little changed in both october and november the fed 
reported 
the manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by the 
feds tightmoney policies as the central bank tries to contain 
inflation by slowing the economy without tipping it into a 
recession 
but in the latest report on inflation the commerce department 
said friday that wholesale prices dipped 01 percent in november 
the third decline in five months 
industrial output had not risen since a 04 percent gain last 
august and that followed a 01 percent drop in july it was down 
03 percent in september 
clearly the manufacturing sector is sluggish contended 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa 
it started in the auto industry earlier this year and spread 
to other consumer durables he said were seeing softness in 
appliances and furniture and in the last month or so seeing it 
show up in the capital goods industry 
output at manufacturing plants making both durable and 
nondurable goods rose 02 percent in november after falling 08 
percent in october and 04 percent in september 
production of durable goods items expected to last more than 
three years rose 05 percent last month after falling 18 percent 
in october and 07 percent in september nondurable manufacturing 
fell 02 percent after rising 05 percent in october and 01 
percent in september 
in another report reflecting sluggishness the fed said the 
operating rate of the nations factories mines and utilities edged 
down 01 percentage point to 827 percent in november to its lowest 
rate since april 1988 
thats one of the reasons youre seeing producer prices 
falling said donald ratajczak economic forecasting director at 
georgia state university when you have excess capacity thats 
when you see price concessions 
the closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the 
greater difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading 
to shortages and subsequent price increases 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures 
factory use had dipped in october to 828 percent from 834 
percent in september the rate posted 10year highs of 843 percent 
last december and january

mikhail s gorbachev led the nation friday in 
mourning andrei d sakharov in a dramatic show of respect for the 
physicist and human rights champion the kremlin once subjected to 
internal exile forcefeeding and kgb harassment 
sakharov who won the the nobel peace prize in 1975 died 
thursday at age 68 in his moscow home apparently of a heart 
attack as he prepared for the latest battle in his war for 
democracy and human rights 
a brilliant scientist sakharov helped develop the hydrogen 
bomb but he sacrificed the perks and honors due a top scientist to 
pursue a human rights campaign that spanned three decades and made 
him the conscience of the nation 
he lived to see many of his dreams come true and his own people 
acknowledge his greatness as the rest of the world had done much 
earlier 
but he died without fulfilling his latest cause forcing the 
communist party to give up its monopoly on power 
gorbachev who in 1986 freed sakharov from nearly seven years in 
exile in the remote city of gorky frequently argued with him in 
public but was respectful in the end 
he was not some sort of political intriguer the kremlin 
chief told reporters during a break in a session of the congress of 
peoples deputies he was a person who had his own ideas his own 
convictions which he expressed openly and directly i valued this 
in him this doesnt mean i agreed with him although on many 
things we did agree 
president bush sent a message to sakharovs widow fellow human 
rights activist yelena bonner saying all of us are diminished 
by his utimely death 
all of us who knew him will never forget his courage and 
devotion to freedom bush said in the darkest hours of his 
struggle for human rights in the soviet union he embodied all that 
is good and decent in the human spirit 
sakharov died alone in his study after returning home from a 
meeting of opposition deputies where he charged the soviet 
hierarchy was leading the country to catastrophe his body was 
discovered by his wife 
yefrem yankelevich sakharovs soninlaw said sakharovs last 
words to his family were tomorrow there will be a battle a 
reference to his plans to press again for an end to the communist 
partys monopoly on power 
he then went to prepare for fridays session of the congress 
the parliament to which he was elected this year 
the congress formed a committee to organize the funeral a 
secretary at the lebedev physics institute where sakharov worked 
said he would be buried monday alongside his parents at 
vostryakovskoe cemetery in southwest moscow gorbachev said he 
would attend 
bonner sakharovs source of strength and his companion during 
the years of struggle and exile sat in a chair next to the body 
friday a few close friends were admitted to the study a separate 
apartment one floor down from his seventh floor apartment on 
moscows garden ring road 
sakharov who suffered angina had looked tired in recent 
months which were filled with foreign trips and work as a deputy 
age and poor health curtailed his activities he looked far 
older than his years but when he felt he had to speak out he did 
though he was a poor speaker with a slight stutter and 
highpitched voice the public had come to know and like sakharov 
so much that an unscientific newspaper poll in october indicated he 
was the most popular parliamentarian outscoring even gorbachev 
and the maverick communist boris n yeltsin 
an official statement showed how far the country had come from 
the days when sakharov was vilified 
everything that he did was dictated by his tireless 
conscience his deep humanitarian convictions vitaly i 
vorotnikov a member of the presidium of the congress and the 
communist party politburo said in announcing sakharovs death to 
the deputies 
fellow scholardeputy dmitri likhachev told the deputies with 
sakharov a part of our heart has departed from us 
human rights activist natan sharansky who spent nine years in 
soviet labor camps before emigrating to israel in 1986 said 
sakharov helped change the whole climate in the soviet union 
lech walesa a fellow nobel peace prize laureate said 
sakharovs death was a great loss for reform both in the soviet 
union and everywhere else 
we needed this man for reforms and for the troubles connected 
with them he told the polish pap news agency 
gorbachevs reform program brought progress toward the goals 
sakharov had set since he turned from nuclear physics to human 
rights withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan glasnost or 
openness on the countrys problems the right to strike economic 
autonomy for factories amnesty for political prisoners and freedom 
of emigration 
but sakharov pressed harder

i personally respect mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev very much 
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of 
perestroika sakharov told the congress in june after it added 
the presidency to gorbachevs job as party general secretary 
he said he had no regrets about the difficult path he had 
followed 
i am proud of this exile in gorky like a medal i wear he 
told the congress 
sakharov was born may 21 1921 in moscow and like his father 
became a physicist he was inducted into the academy of sciences in 
1953 at age 32 the youngest member ever 
in 1948 he joined physicist igor tamm in developing the 
hydrogen bomb and for the next 20 years lived in secrecy with a 
good apartment driver high salary and government awards but 
like albert einstein sakharov began to worry about the morality of 
developing weapons of mass destruction 
he had his first major brush with the kremlin in 1961 when he 
appealed to premier nikita s khrushchev to stop testing nuclear 
weapons khrushchev responded that scientists shouldnt meddle in 
politics two years later the soviet union agreed to such limits 
in a treaty with the united states 
sakharov horrified at soviet societys mistreatment of its 
citizens said his social and political views underwent a major 
evolution he risked his status and began using his influence for 
victims of human rights abuses in 1966 
the authorities showed their rage in 1968 when sakharovs 
progress coexistence and intellectual freedom was published 
abroad it called for sovietamerican detente long before the 
concept became part of soviet foreign policy he was banned from 
work on secret projects 
sakharov called the essay a turning point in my life and two 
years later he helped found the moscow human rights committee 
after the 1968 death of his first wife klavdia he married bonner 
in 1971 and she became his constant companion 
he spoke out against repression of dissidents and for democratic 
reforms his cluttered onebedroom apartment became a mecca for 
troubled soviets crimean tatars volga germans political 
prisoners religious believers and refuseniks jews denied 
permission to emigrate 
in awarding him the peace prize in 1975 the nobel committee 
called him the conscience of contemporary mankind 
by 1980 the authorities had had enough sakharov condemned the 
soviet invasion of afghanistan in an american tv interview and on 
jan 22 1980 kgb agents seized him on a moscow street without 
charges or a trial he was exiled to gorky 250 miles east of the 
capital and stripped of his awards 
the oncerespected scientist spent nearly seven years in the 
remote city with kgb guards trailing him searching his apartment 
and secretly filming him he was cut off from the world 
despite heart trouble sakharov was drugged and tied to a bed 
and forcefed during a hunger strike 
we wont let you die but we will make you an invalid a 
doctor warned him 
western governments scientific and human rights groups pressed 
the soviets to release sakharov then in december 1986 gorbachev 
phoned to say he could return to moscow sakharov restraining his 
joy at the news to show his concern for others told gorbachev to 
free all political prisoners 
two months after sakharovs release scores of political 
prisoners were freed and he threw his support behind gorbachev he 
got his old job back at the academy of sciences and in november 
1988 was allowed to travel abroad for the first time even though 
gorbachev had said sakharov could not go to other countries because 
he knew state secrets 
survivors include a son and two daughters from his first 
marriage as well as bonners children from a previous marriage 
son alexei semyonov and daughter tatiana who is married to 
yefrem yankelevich

hundreds of thousands of east germans hopped 
onto crowded westward trains or trudged across the border through 
pouring rain friday in a rush to do their christmas shopping in the 
west 
the communist leadership reminded its citizens that despite 
their forays into consumer paradise some hard sweaty work 
is needed to improve things back home 
since borders were opened nov 9 millions of east germans have 
poured into the west germany lured in part by the 100 marks 55 
in welcome money the bonn government gives each of them 
with christmas just around the corner the pace of visitors has 
picked up with 320000 crossing into northern bavaria alone early 
friday tens of thousands more arrived in west berlin and other 
parts of west germany 
officials in the northern state of schleswigholstein and the 
central state of hesse were planning to open nine new border 
crossings to handle the influx 
to cut down on the traffic chaos the new crossings will be 
limited to those on bicycle and foot 
the will to shop was driving some of the visitors to extremes 
dozens waited at the crossing near near probstzella jumping 
onto packed trains as they slowed down before entering northern 
bavaria said hans schlee of the state border police headquarters 
in munich 
about 1100 people couldnt get on any train at probstzella and 
walked into bavaria through a driving nearly freezing rain 
shivering and soaked the group arrived in nearby ludwigstadt much 
to the surprise of local townspeople 
its unbelievable what people will do said schlee noting 
there were dozens of children in the group 
the nowfamiliar east german trabant cars filled parking places 
in downtown munich and in other major west german towns along the 
border 
but the communist party newspaper neues deutschland reminded its 
readers the shoppers will be returning to the same troubles after 
their excursions to what it called consumer paradise 
the shining mountains of goods in the society of 
overabundance have magical attraction the newspaper 
acknowledged 
but it cautioned we will have to live with the reality of 
open borders but a markedly lower level of productivity and 
prosperity 
it will take hard sweaty work to minimize the gap between 
east germany and its rich western neighbor it said 
for those thinking of possible reunification neues deutschland 
warned of the two million unemployed in the federal republic an 
estimated six million poor as well as the crisis in housing and 
education 
east german leaders have been pleading with the people to avoid 
the temptation of reunification with west germany 
but there are growing indications that a sizeable portion of the 
country would gladly exchange socialism for some of the shimmer and 
prosperity of western capitalism 
despite the new freedom of movement more than 1000 east 
germans each day are coming to west germany to resettle permanently

but the 45 people dressed in spotted suits masquerading as 101 
dalmatians were a hit with the crowd thursday and as they ran 
along they barked a christmas carol 
every year hundreds of runners dress up and jog through the 
streets in the jingle bell run a zany event that mixes racing and 
costume competition this years event raised money for a local 
blood center 
one group of runners dressed as a nintendo game set complete 
with a silver screen and two fighters trying to save christmas 
there was a group of rapsinging and dancing reindeer 
there also was a group of christmas seals all wearing brown 
trash bags and whiskers and there was a santaandelf duet with 
the elf inhaling helium before the two sang jingle bells

his last words were about continuing the fight 
over a quartercentury andrei d sakharov 68 pursued his 
vision of a just lessbrutal society undaunted by kremlin 
vilification the scorn of his scientific peers and the kgb 
before anybody but sovietologists had heard of mikhail s 
gorbachev sakharov demanded glasnost gorbachevs policy of 
openness before gorbachevs kremlin declared a 19month unilateral 
freeze on nuclear testing sakharov publicly sought a halt to all 
tests 
long before the soviet leadership admitted stalins crimes to 
the world sakharov was among those few who denounced them and he 
noisily sought redress for the victims 
the kremlin this year acknowledged its 1979 invasion of 
afghanistan was a mistake and even a crime but sakharov in 1980 
had denounced it and he paid with nearly seven years of exile 
the stooped rumpled physicist died thursday but the future he 
and other dissidents fought so hard for in the 1960s and 70s has 
in part come true for many soviets the man who spoke his 
independent mind in a stammering voice will be irreplacable 
we have lost our moral compass mourned roald z sagdeyev 
sakharovs colleague at the academy of sciences and a fellow member 
of the congress of peoples deputies 
at the height of the dissident era in the 1970s no cause seemed 
too small for sakharov crimean tatars soviet jews and germans 
seeking to emigrate dissidents and religious activists all found 
succor and sympathy in his tworoom moscow apartment 
while others kept silent in the oppression of the pregorbachev 
era this honored son of the soviet regime spoke out against 
injustice and in favor of individual freedom he risked his 
personal fortune his liberty his health 
the worldwide opprobrium his criticisms brought the kremlin 
plus outrage at his 1980 exile to gorky and brutal treatment there 
by the kgb showed soviet leaders they could not hope to be fully 
accepted members of the international community while still 
repressing their citizenry 
sakharovs voice was only one of many raised in protest but it 
carried the farthest 
in december 1986 when gorbachev telephoned him in gorky to say 
he could return to moscow it proved the kremlin proclaiming 
greater openness was now ready to tolerate criticism it once 
branded antisoviet and even treasonous 
many of the causes pursued by sakharov and the dissidents of the 
1970s were won under gorbachev named soviet leader in march 1985 
there are now greater liberties of selfexpression freer 
emigration successes in superpower disarmament mass amnesties of 
political prisoners 
soviet dissent however continues on other themes from 
proindependence political groups in the baltics to the democratic 
union a selfstyled alternative party seeking a britishstyle 
parliament but none of their members has the domestic audience and 
international reach of sakharov and other antiestablishment 
leaders like maverick communist boris n yeltsin are considered 
by many to be demagogues or driven by ambition 
a developer of the soviet hydrogen bomb who later recoiled in 
horror at what he had wrought sakharov could have settled into a 
comfortable life back in moscow with his wife yelena bonner 
continuing research on the physical properties of the universe he 
did so for a while but his conscience would not let him rest 
i personally respect mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev very much 
but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator of 
perestroika he declared this summer after overcoming opposition 
from the leadership of the academy of sciences to become one of its 
representatives in the new congress 
with growing determination sakharov fought against the 
communist partys constitutional monopoly on power his status as a 
deputy meant that for the first time tens of millions of soviets 
heard his views on staterun tv he had spoken out previously about 
the abuses of power now he wanted to alter the very foundations of 
power 
it was to be his last as yet unsuccessful fight a nationwide 
strike sakharov called for monday to force the congress to enact a 
multiparty system flopped led by gorbachev the parliamentarians 
rejected debate on the issue 1138 to 839 
after dinner thursday the nobel peace laureate left his 
seventhfloor moscow apartment for his bookstrewn office one floor 
below he was planning a speech to renew his attack on article 6 
the constitutional guarantee of communist party rule 
his parting words were tomorrow there will be a battle 
said soninlaw yefrem yankelevich it was one of the rare battles 
of his times that sakharov would not take part in he died alone 
apparently of a heart attack 
retiring on his laurels were not for sakharov in june he 
tangled for the first time with gorbachev at the soviet congress 
over breaking the communist partys legal grip on power 
gorbachev tried to cut him off but sakharov kept speaking i 
will continue sakharov declared from the podium he did until 
the end

zimbabwes main opposition party friday 
unveiled its platform for next years parliamentary elections and 
promised to fight to preserve the nations multiparty democracy 
edgar tekere leader of the zimbabwe unity movement also said 
the nation should seek a dialogue with neighboring south africa 
tekere 52 was a founder of president robert mugabes zimbabwe 
african national union and a secretarygeneral but mugabe fired 
him a year ago after tekere publicly attacked the goverment for 
alleged widespread corruption 
tekere formed the unity movement in april and gained support 
from students trade union members and farmers disillusioned with 
unfulfilled promises of reform made when mugabe led the british 
colony to independence in 1980 
the unity movement has lost five parliamentary byelections in 
government strongholds but it captured sufficient ballots to raise 
government fears that tekere could secure a foothold in the 
150seat parliament in elections next year 
a date has not been set for the balloting but it must be held 
before april 18 the nations 10th anniversary 
zimbabwe is one of the few westernstyle democracies in africa 
but the aim of mugabes african national union has been to 
establish a oneparty state founded on marxistleninist principles 
the party is to hold a fiveday congress beginning tuesday and 
the 4800 delegates are to debate whether they should stick with 
their goal of creating a oneparty state at a time when most 
eastern european countries that were mugabes role models are 
adopting democratic reforms 
the african national union would need the support of twothirds 
of parliament to change to a oneparty system 
tekere said such a system would amount to tyranny 
his platform calls for replacing the presidency with the 
ceremonial post of head of state and a prime minister as the 
government leader 
the executive presidency in zimbabwe concentrates power in one 
individual and this dangerous consolidation of power in a single 
set of hands must be avoided tekere said at a news conference 
friday 
he also said zimbabwe should establish contacts with the ruling 
white minority in south africa tekere said that nations 
government deserved recognition for holding talks with black 
nationalists capped this week by south african president fw de 
klerks meeting with nelson mandela leader of the outlawed african 
national congress 
why not take a lead from mandela tekere said 
mugabes government opposes contacts with south africa 
the unity movements platform also calls for an economic policy 
based on a combination of socialism and free enterprise and a 
redistribution of land to benefit the nations 9 million blacks 
about a third of the land now is held by the white minority which 
numbers about 100000 
a similar program failed under mugabes government when 
politicians bought up most available farms 
tekere also said zimbabwe should withdraw its 12000 troops from 
neighboring mozambique where they are guarding trade routes 
against attacks by guerrillas of the rightwing mozambique national 
resistance tekere said zimbabwe should open talks with the rebels 
to stop the attacks

a flock of hefty muscovy ducks has 
terrorized residents of this quiet retirement community nipping at 
their heals chasing them to their doors and chewing on one womans 
dress 
they are mean natalie scaccia said friday they keep 
after you they get ugly and want to bite people her husband 
fell over a wire fence and cut his finger trying to get away from 
one 
in the past month the ducks which number about 100 have bitten 
or harassed six residents said ida trzaskowski 82 president of 
the palm terrace civic association 
lena piemonte said she is scared to leave home when she went 
outside to check her mail tuesday she was attacked the duck 
crossed a street and chased her to her doorstep 
he chewed on my dress she said i was trying to get away 
and i took a terrible fall 
she took her late husbands cane friday when she went to the 
mailbox if anyone comes near me im going to bat them theyre 
not going to attack me again 
the pasco county sheriffs office said one person got a tetanus 
shot after she was bitten on the finger by one of the ducks 
theyre attacking our people trzaskowski said theyre 
scared to death they never expected an animal like that to come 
after them 
the animals have no fear of people because people feed them and 
drainage ponds in the subdivision attract them 
county animal control workers and state wildlife officials tell 
residents they cannot help 
pasco county animal control officers dont remove ducks because 
theyll just fly back to the same spot said manager e gordon 
ulrey we dont do ducks he said

gray cat jumped from her roommates arms and scrambled beneath the 
house 
she said she tried to lure dewey out with cat food but failed 
ms hogan told an orkin employee not to begin fumigating if 
there was any chance of her cat being under the house according 
to the lawsuit 
the cats body was found nearly a week later halfcovered with 
soil a few feet from the back porch she said 
ms hogan said an orkin employee she talked with identified 
only as mike in the complaint acknowledged burying the cat 
chip girkins general manager for orkin in tampa said ms hogan 
told workers to fumigate the house even though she knew the cat 
might be underneath it he acknowledged a worker buried the cat 
without telling the owner

the government criticized a year ago for 
holding back public warning of possible terrorist activity issued 
a rare advisory friday saying there could be holidayseason attacks 
on americans overseas 
the federal aviation administration issued a similar bulletin to 
airlines and a spokesman for pan american world airways said we 
have enhanced our security systemwide 
we want to be as forthcoming as possible with information of 
this kind said state department press officer anita stockman 
the information we have received constitutes sufficient reason to 
be concerned and to pass our concern to the american people 
she said there was no information about a specific threat 
against americans but that the warning was based on an 
increased level of weapons seizures and arrests of persons 
affiliated with middle eastern terrorist groups in recent weeks 
she emphasized that for traveling americans we are not 
advising anybody anything we are not asking or advising people to 
cancel travel plans we are simply passing on information we 
feel should be brought to the attention of travelers who must make 
their own decisions 
the government advisory came just six days before the first 
anniversary of the terrorist attack that blew up pan am flight 103 
over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 aboard as well as 11 
people on the ground 
in the ensuing investigation it was revealed that us 
authorities had received warnings about the possibility of a 
terrorist attack but had not made them public believing they were 
not necessarily reliable and might unduly spread alarm 
this time the us government decided to issue a public 
advisory at the same time it began briefing foreign governments 
about such a threat said a department official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
a brief statement issued by the department cited recent 
reports of movement of middle eastern terrorists in western 
europe and suggested terrorists may be planning nearterm 
attacks against a variety of targets possibly including us 
interests 
it did not say more specifically where attacks might occur but 
added if credible specific information or a threat to the 
public is received the department of state will provide additional 
information for travelers and other concerned parties 
in addition the federal aviation administration advised 
airlines to step up security on potentially affected flights 
certainly it enhances our vigilance said jeff kriendler a 
spokesman for pan american world airways but he said he did not 
believe the alert would impede holiday travel we do have a 
system in place which we think we can handle the flow he said 
in new york pan am spokesman alan loflin said largely 
because of the anniversary we have coming up and also because of 
the incredible amount of passenger traffic we have enhanced out 
security systemwide mostly this involves using more security 
people 
he declined to give specifics on additional security 
fridays announcement is significant because its the first 
time im aware of that there is a public announcement said 
robert kupperman a terrorism expert at the center for strategic 
and international studies a washington think tank 
in the case of pan am 103 we warned some government officials 
and left the public naked this time it appears were not going to 
get caught in that way 
the warnings followed a highvisibility mobilization of security 
forces in france where officers were posted at airports public 
buildings and other areas where large numbers of people congregate 
one us government source said france was the prime focus of 
american concerns 
the warning was triggered in part by the discovery of 440 pounds 
of explosives nov 24 in valencia spain and the arrest by spanish 
police of eight men 
french police said the men and explosives had been destined for 
france spanish authorities said at least three of those arrested 
are members of hezbollah an iranbacked group of extremist shiites 
based in lebanon 
also raising concern was the arrival of the christmas season 
with a number of anniversaries coming up which terrorists sometimes 
use as occasions for carrying out violent activities 
besides the pan am explosion other terrorist incidents that 
have occurred in december include attacks on the airports in rome 
and vienna two days after christmas in 1985 the department 
official said the increased number of americans in europe during 
the holiday season is additional cause for wariness

an army board has refused to grant the medal 
of honor to a world war ii veteran who colleagues claimed was 
passed over for decoration because he was jewish an army official 
lt col terry adkins said today 
david s rubitsky then an army sergeant had been recommended 
for the medal by company and battalion commanders they cited a 
battle in the jungles of new guinea in which he was said to have 
killed more than 500 japanese soldiers 
adkins said an exhaustive twoyear investigation into 
rubitskys claims showed the battle did not occur as alleged 
as for the claim that rubitsky was denied the medal because of 
antisemitism he said i could not find any basis of fact in 
this 
rubitsky who lives in wisconsin was notified thursday night of 
the decision and the army presented its findings to congress today 
adkins said 
the armys decision was first reported today by the new york 
times 
board officials said the lack of official records the death of 
witnesses and the failing memories of those who survived the 
campaign thwarted their review 
but the toughest obstacle was the implausibility that one 
soldier armed with a machine gun automatic rifle and a carbine 
could inflict such damage singlehandedly 
they said rubitsky would have needed large amounts of ammunition 
and would have been able to fire only one weapon while the japanese 
returned his fire forcing him to keep his head down and shoot 
without taking aim 
board officials said it was most likely rubitsky fought well and 
had inflicted heavy casualties 
the story of rubitskys heroics had been largely forgotten until 
1986 when during a reunion of the 128th regiment he fought in it 
was learned he had never been recommended for the medal of honor 
after the war rubitsky traveled the world as a merchant marine for 
more than 30 years 
jm stehling his company commander said in a recently 
notarized statement i personally inspected the battle scene and 
there were more than 500 japanese killed or wounded by the actions 
of sgt rubitsky his actions were heroic and he should receive 
the medal of honor 
in another statement herbert a smith a retired major general 
who was rubitskys battalion commander said he passed stehlings 
recommendation to col john h mott chief of staff of the 32nd 
division 
col motts answer was you mean a jew for the congressional 
medal of honor said smith who died three months ago 
smith said mott who also is dead just laughed and walked 
away 
the board also looked at a handwritten notation on a yellowing 
photograph that had been removed from the body of a japanese 
officer 47 years ago he said he would commit suicide to atone for 
having sent into battle 600 fine japanese soldiers who died 
because of a solitary american soldier 
secret service experts in counterfeiting told sen herbert h 
kohl dwis that the ink and paper of the photograph that 
recently came to light were consistent with materials used in 1942 
they concluded there was no reason to believe the photo was 
anything other than genuine 
kohls office had interceded on behalf of rubitsky a wisconsin 
resident 
of 295 medals of honor awarded in world war ii none went to 
black soldiers only two went to jews according to the jewish war 
veterans of america

francois mitterrand invited george 
bush to lunch saturday on this sunsplashed french island in the 
caribbean and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist 
dollars from the publicity 
this is a historic situation for st martin said albert 
fleming mayor of marigot the capital we have never had two 
presidents together 
bush and mitterrand will hold a twohour meeting and working 
lunch at an exclusive sun resort on st martin 140 miles east of 
puerto rico 
us and french officials have announced no agenda for the 
talks but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest 
developments in eastern europe including the reopening of borders 
between east germany and west germany the french president has 
cautioned against a push for a reunified germany saying it could 
upset the european balance of power 
mitterrands invitation to bush was in return for a visit the 
french leader made in may to bushs home in kennebunkport maine 
on arrival at princess juliana international airport on st 
maarten the dutch half of the island bush and mitterrand are to 
be flown separately by helicopter to lhabitation de longvilliers 
a 253room luxury hotel and marina at marcel cove on the 
northeastern coast of st martin 
a helicopter and scores of french presidential gendarmes and 
army troops patrolled the 150acre resort grounds friday checking 
incoming cars with a metal detector us security officers also 
were making rounds 
at the meeting site workers set up a beachside tent for the 
leaders and hooked up communication cables 
bush and mitterrand wont be mixing with residents fleming 
said which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and 
bunting in the capital a few tourist shops however were selling 
bushmitterrand tshirts 
theres a little painting up a little taping up but 
basically thats for christmas fleming said 
similarly on dutch st maarten there was little evidence of 
the event although roger snow publisher of the chronicle 
newspaper said everybody is talking about it of course 
the island bush and mitterrand are visiting is a curious mix of 
french dutch and carribbean cultures 
st martin with its sidewalk cafes fashionable boutiques and 
strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks has been called 
a speck of france in the caribbean technically it is a 
subprefecture of the french overseas department of guadeloupe 
which has a status akin to a us state 
st maarten is part of the autonomous fiveisland netherland 
antilles dutch is the official language but few people speak it 
nearly everybody speaks english instead although the papiamento 
language is also heard 
the french side is 21 square miles and the dutch side 16 square 
miles population estimates vary widely but the 1990 caribbean 
island handbook says there are at least 8000 in st martin and 
14000 in st maarten 
the french have some topless and allnude beaches the dutch 
casino gambling with dutyfree shopping and 36 sandy white beaches 
ringing the island both sides have been experiencing a tourism 
boom in recent years with a corresponding rise in crime and 
concerns about overdevelopment 
nevertheless fleming said he thought the island was bound to 
benefit from having hundreds of foreign newspaper reporters and tv 
crews covering the oneday summit 
that exposure throughout the world is very important to 
tourism the mayor said and we cater to the tourist we dont 
have any other income but the tourist trade 
fleming said 600000 tourists a year visit the french side of 
the island alone spending 90 million not counting cruise ship 
passengers americans account for most of the tourist trade

the us merchandise trade deficit surged to 
102 billion in october the worst imbalance in 10 months as a 
record level of imports swamped a small rise in exports the 
commerce department said friday 
the october deficit was a sharp 198 percent higher than the 
september imbalance of 851 billion reflecting a higher foreign 
oil bill and big increases in imports of food and industrial 
supplies 
private economists said even discounting the monthtomonth 
volatility in the trade statistics the october report served to 
emphasize that the trade woes that have plagued america throughout 
the 1980s will be a principal headache well into the next decade 
however there was better economic news on the inflation front 
where prices at the wholesale level posted their third decline in 
five months the 01 percent november decline reflected a big drop 
in gasoline costs that offset a rise in food prices 
the november price reduction was expected to further ease fears 
about inflation and give the federal reserve more room to cut 
interest rates in an effort to keep the economy from dipping into a 
recession 
some analysts predicted that the central bank could act as soon 
as next week to cut interest rates slightly given widespread signs 
of weakness especially in manufacturing 
in a third economic report the government said friday that 
americas factories mines and utilities operated at 827 percent 
of capacity in november a drop of 01 percentage point from 
october and the lowest operating rate since april 1988 
last january the factory operating rate hit a 10year high of 
843 percent as american manufacturers boosted production because 
of a boom in export sales caused by a drop in the value of the 
dollar which made us goods more competitive on overseas markets 
however export growth has slowed this year and many analysts 
are predicting it will slow further in 1990 reflecting the fact 
that the dollar was rising in value for much of this year 
when the slowdown in exports is combined with a growing 
dependence on foreign oil many economists are predicting that the 
trade deficit will worsen in 1990 after two years of improvements 
until there is a fundamental change in our competitiveness 
situation i think well see the trade deficit averaging around 9 
billion a month said lawrence chimerine senior adviser to the 
wefa group an economic consulting company 
it is the same old story imports are continuing to rise due 
to oil and the increased attractiveness of foreign products many 
of which we dont produce any more 
through the first 10 months of this year the trade deficit has 
been running at an annual rate of 1094 billion down modestly 
from last years deficit of 11853 billion 
david wyss senior economist at drimcgraw hill predicted that 
the deficit for the entire year would be around 108 billion but 
would rise next year to around 112 billion 
trade is going to be a continuing problem that is not going to 
go away in a hurry he said 
while some administration officials have also conceded that the 
trade deficit could rise next year the white house issued an 
upbeat assessment of the countrys international performance 
noting that the trade deficit is still running at a lower rate than 
in 1988 
were doing exactly the right thing and no changes are 
necessary at this time said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
the overall october deficit of 102 billion was the largest 
since a 108 billion deficit in december 1988 
imports climbed to an alltime high of 4121 billion 51 
percent above the september level part of this increase had been 
expected given the fact that merchants often boost orders at this 
time of year to restock shelves before christmas 
among the biggest import increases were an 18 percent jump in 
foreign agricultural shipments and a 14 percent rise in imports of 
industrial materials 
americas foreign oil bill shot up 85 percent to 438 billion 
as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to 1709 the number of 
barrels imported daily was essentially unchanged at 826 million 
us exports were also up by 11 percent rising to 3101 
billion with analysts saying the gain would have been even better 
except for a strike at boeing that cut down on production of 
jetliners 
as usual the biggest deficit in october was recorded with 
japan an imbalance of 49 billion almost half of the total for 
the month as imports from that country hit a record level 
other large deficits included a 128 billion imbalance with 
taiwan an 843 million deficit with canada a 783 million deficit 
with china and a deficit of 461 million with the countries of 
western europe

the nato foreign ministers on friday 
hailed andrei d sakharov as a pioneer who played a key role in 
changing soviet society 
nato secretary general manfred woerner said the ministers 
expressed a deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of andrei 
sakharov 
he said the allies underscored that sakharov played an 
exceptional role personally and who was a symbol for universal 
democratic values 
officials said us secretary of state james a baker iii and 
his nato counterparts discussed sakharov at the start of the second 
and last day of their yearend strategy talks at the alliance 
headquarters 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said in view of the 
soviet human rights leaders stature it was only natural that we 
reflected for a minute on sakharovs death 
sakharov is a man we must remember with much respect for the 
untiring way he strove for freedom van den broek said after the 
meeting 
he called his death a loss for the soviet union and especially 
for the forces of reform there for many in the communist 
world this man was a beacon 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said after the meeting 
we all feel a very deep sense of loss at the death of mr 
sakharov 
we should remember today the great courage which it took in 
very difficult and dangerous times for him to act and go on acting 
as the focus symbol the spokesman of freedom in the soviet 
union he said 
hurd said he was glad sakharov lived long enough to see 
substantial progress in the direction which he was pointing his 
country toward 
and i think in remembering that today we must also express the 
hope that the torch will be handed on and that work which is not 
yet completed will be carried forward by people who will rembmer 
him hurd added 
baker called sakharov a tremendous force for peace and 
freedom 
he was as well a courageous pioneer who led the way in the 
face of great adversity and we are very sad by his passing baker 
said 
i think sakharov would be pleased if our reflection on his 
work extended as well to all of those brave men and women many of 
them whose names well never know who sacrificed their liberty 
indeed their lives for the freedom of others 
baker said until the very end sakharov pursued the causes 
that meant the very most to him standing up in parliament for 
beliefs that may not be fully accepted today but which will have 
their day

the navy cant guarantee pilots wont drop 
bombs outside designated central nevada target ranges the military 
said friday as cleanup of stray bombs on public lands was suspended 
for the winter 
nobody could say that it wont happen again said olin 
briggs spokesman for the fallon naval air station theres 
malfunction of equipment that could happen and theres always 
human error 
capt rex rackowitz commanding officer at fallon where the 
nations fighter pilots train has said bombs and rockets might 
have landed outside fenced ranges for the past 30 years because of 
pilot or equipment error or he has said they could have skipped 
along the desert floor after failing to explode upon impact 
bombs duds and shrapnel that landed as much as one mile outside 
ranges were being removed or blown up on site in a sevenweek 
cleanup exercise codenamed operation ugly baby the ranges 
begin 60 miles east of reno 
there are plans to keep some 110000 acres surrounding the bravo 
16 17 and 19 ranges closed to the public through the winter in 
case undiscovered ordnance remains bureau of land management 
spokesman bob stewart said 
a team of 150 explosive ordnance disposal personnel flown to 
fallon to help with the exercise were going home friday briggs 
said there are no definite plans to enlist such a large group 
again to help clear away stray bombs he added 
it would be misleading to indicate we were finished with this 
thing briggs said well keep plugging away at it relying on 
the assets at our base but basically we only have five eods at 
fallon permanantly and they have to work on the ranges too 
briggs said he expects all the red flagged bombs to be destroyed 
friday so the navy doesnt leave ordnance exposed during the 
winter although people wont have access to the lands normally 
used for hiking hunting grazing and offroad vehicles 
the navy sought indefinite closure of the 110000 acres of land 
surrounding the bombing ranges because of fears buried ordnance 
remains undetected and could blow up if disturbed by people or 
animals 
the land will be reopened next summer and cant be permanantly 
closed without congressional approval stewart said 
no injuries have been reported from public contact with any 
stray bombs according to briggs who said the cleanup exercise went 
safely he said one navy worker hurt his leg when he fell down a 
hill but no other injuries were reported during the sweeps for 
bombs 
briggs didnt have statistics on the total amount of ordnance 
discovered during the exercise that cost the navy several hundred 
thousand dollars the navy recovered more than 2000 bombs and duds 
from its bravo 17 range alone 
the navy was cited by the state of nevada for improper disposal 
procedures of hazardous waste and for failing to notify the state 
of the cleanup effort that began secretly in october 
the navy faces fines of up to 10000 a day per violation if 
found guilty

the 16 nato allies eased eastwest 
tension another notch friday approving a us proposal to let 
unarmed warsaw pact aircraft fly over their territory in search of 
suspicious military activity 
the open skies idea originated with president dwight d 
eisenhower more than 30 years ago at the height of the cold war 
and was revised by president bush last spring to include 
surveillance of laboratories 
it will be discussed at a natowarsaw pact meeting in february 
in ottawa canada that also could produce new proposals for 
further troop reductions in europe 
at the end of a twoday meeting nato foreign ministers also 
agreed to consider proposals by secretary of state james a baker 
iii that the alliances role be expanded as the threat of military 
confrontation with the soviet union recedes 
manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the western alliance said 
he was confident of eventual agreement on setting up nato panels to 
verify troop reductions in europe and possibly a role in mediating 
regional conflicts 
the ministers welcomed an unprecedented visit to alliance 
headquarters by soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for 
a meeting with woerner on tuesday 
i dont see it paving the way for soviet membership in nato 
baker said at a news conference 
woerner the former west german defense minister said he and 
shevardnadze would discuss matters of common interest this is a 
first contact 
we will have an exchange of views he said but we will 
not negotiate 
shevardnadze also is expected ito meet informally with 
ambassadors of the 16 nato nations 
douglas hurd the british foreign secretary described the visit 
as a symbol of whats been happening in eastwest relations 
foreign secretary joe clark of canada called it a courtesy call 
and said i think they are interested in opening lines and in 
that context i think it will be quite constructive 
baker said he probably would not pay a similar visit to the 
warsaw pact because the sevennation eastern alliance has no exact 
counterpart to woerner a visit would mean meeting with a soviet 
general which baker ruled out 
baker and shevardnadze are to meet in the soviet union at the 
end of january 
their main task will be clearing a path to completion of a 
treaty on reducing longrange nuclear missiles bombers and 
submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent in time for bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to sign it at a washington summit in 
june 
a statement concluding the annual winter meeting of nato foreign 
ministers welcomed political and economic reforms under way in 
eastern europe and urged that the progress achieved must be 
consolidated 
baker would not say whether he considered the changes 
irreversible but declared everything that we do should be 
directed to locking in these changes 
in their statement the ministers said many problems remain 
the rule of law and democratic government through free elections 
have yet to be fully institutionalized 
it also included a caution about soviet military might we 
cannot ignore the military realities that our alliance continues to 
face and which lie at the heart of europes security problems 
on open skies the ministers said the concept has a very 
special value 
the willingness of a country to be overflown is in itself a 
highly significant political act in that it demonstrates its 
availability to openness the statement said 
western alliance ministers said the aerial surveillance could be 
used to ensure compliance with an agreement being negotiated in 
vienna to reduce conventional military forces in europe 
they proposed that europe the soviet union the united states 
and canada be open to surveillance flights 
countries would be assigned quotas based on size prescribing 
the permitted number of observation flights by unarmed fixedwing 
aircraft 
several flights a month would be allowed over larger countries 
and no country could accept fewer than one every three months 
on german reunification baker endorsed statements by the west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher renouncing claims 
to polish territory that belonged to germany before world war ii 
he said the 1975 helsinki agreement affirmed that europes 
postwar borders were inviolable 
the nato ministers supported eventual reunification of east 
germany and west germany through peaceful and democratic means 
later friday baker and other us officials met with top 
officials of the european commission the european communitys 
executive body baker was accompanied by agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter trade representative carla hills commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher and william k reilly administrator of 
the environmental portection agency 
at a joint news conference jacques delors the commission 
president called for more efficient and effective consultation 
with the united states on changes in the east 
you said it fine baker commented

iranians braved rain and cold in tehran 
and five other cities friday to choose nine parliament members in 
elections considered a crucial test for president hashemi 
rafsanjanis pragmatic policies 
hardliners fear rafsanjanis efforts to liberalize the economy 
and iranian society will undermine revolutionary fervor and the 
ideological purity of the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said turnout in five of the 
six constituencies including tehran was so great that the 5 
oclock closing time of the polls was extended by two hours 
but observers in tehran reported low voter turnout 
an asian diplomat based in tehran said the 5 pm closing time 
of the polls was extended to attract lastminute voters in an 
effort to increase the count 
the radio did not provide a figure for voter turnout but the 
islamic republic news agency also monitored in nicosia said all 
constituents over 15 were eligible to vote 
candidates chosen by the electorate will represent tehran 
kashan karaj kerman bandarturkmankordkui and kuhdashtchegini 
in parliament some of the constituencies are multimember 
four seats in tehran were being contested by 38 candidates many 
of them hardline opponents of rafsanjani and his socalled 
pragmatic policies 
rafsanjanis former seat in tehran which he won with a record 
12 million votes in the last general election in aprilmay 1988 
is one of those vacant 
he gave up that seat following his victory in the presidential 
elections in june 
most of the other vacant seats in the 270member majlis or 
parliament were left empty when rafsanjani appointed legislators 
to posts in his new administration 
rafsanjanis ambitious policies to revive the economy by 
improving ties with the west to attract badly needed investment and 
technology are under attack by a hardline faction led by former 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
mohtashemi who is contesting one of the tehran seats was 
dumped in august when rafsanjani formed his new government 
he is closely linked with shiite moslem extremists believed to 
hold most of the 18 western hostages including eight americans 
in lebanon 
he was also involved with militants who carried out suicide 
bombings against the us embassy and the us marine base in 
beirut in 1983 killing hundreds of people 
fridays elections are montashemis first major effort to make a 
comeback 
the majlis is already dominated by radicals of various stripes 
and further gains by hardliners in the elections will intensify 
pressure on rafsanjani 
rafsanjani has been very lowkey about the elections 
he said friday after casting his vote that these are not the 
general elections therefore they lack enthusiasm but in any case 
they are effective his remarks were broadcast on tehran tv 
monitored in cyprus 
khomeini who died june 3 spent much of his time after the 1979 
revolution mediating squabbles between hardliners and pragmatists 
and keeping their power in check the power struggle has 
intensified since rafsanjani became president and began sidelining 
his opponents 
apart from mohtashemi a number of other exministers dumped by 
rafsanjani are standing in the election 
this includes former labor minister abulqasem sarhadizadeh 
former education minister reza akrani former heavy industries 
minister behzad nabavi former commerce minister habibollah asgar 
owladi and former posts and telegraph minister morteza nabavi

deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
said friday that acts of violence committed by leftist militants in 
nicaragua against opposition groups raise grave doubts about 
the sandinista governments willingness to hold fair elections 
eagleburger spoke to reporters after outlining his concerns 
about the nicaraguan electoral process to organization of american 
states secretary general joao baena soares the oas has election 
observers in nicaragua 
the administration has criticized the sandinista government on 
an almost daily basis of late for alleged abuses against opposition

eagleburger said he told baena soares that the recent spate of 
sandinista violence is part of a systematic pattern that raises 
grave doubts about the intentions of the nicaraguan government 
he said the nicaraguan government is at a crossroads it can 
hold free and fair elections and thereby advance the process of 
national reconciliation in nicaragua and peace in central america

opposition he said 
on thursday members of a bipartisan panel gave president bush a 
firsthand account of bloodletting last weekend that they said was 
caused by sandinista supporters wielding machetes

the four clock faces on big ben clanked to a halt 
for three hours friday and londons heart seemed to skip a beat 
the government agency that services big ben and other state 
buildings throughout the country said the clock stopped at 1107 
am and was out of action until about 215 pm 
a spokeswoman for the property services agency speaking 
anonymously said the cogs that advance the clocks hands were 
unable to turn even though the pendulum continued to swing she 
could not explain what caused the malfunction 
big ben is the name of the 13ton bell which chimes out the 
hours from behind the clock faces 
stoppages are rare for the giant 131yearold clock tower which 
has survived pollution foul weather and war the british 
broadcasting corp uses the chimes to introduce its 6 pm and 
midnight newscasts taking the sound live by microphone from the 
tower its other newscasts use the atomic clock at greenwich 
in december 1986 it lost a note in the quarterhour chimes 
because of a broken connecting rod 
the following month the hammers that strike its famous bongs 
that tell listeners the hour froze up in chilly weather 
windshields were erected to warm up the clocks mechanism and get 
it back on tune 
the 20story clock tower stands over the houses of parliament 
and one legislator took advantage of the latest stoppage to poke 
fun at the policies of the governing conservative and opposition 
labor parties during a house of commons debate on socialism 
far be it for me to defend socialism or whatever brand or 
variety the labor party is talking about said charles kennedy of 
the centrist social and liberal democrats i just cannot help but 
reflect however as i walked in that big ben had stopped 
although time has run out on socialism said kennedy the 
clock also seemed to have stopped on the conservatism of this 
government

the city council voted friday to fire a law 
firm because it lobbies for salvadoran president alfredo 
christiani a day after four partners and one associate lawyer 
resigned from the firm for the same reason 
after individual and collective soulsearching we decided 
that this was the best thing to do said douglas franzen one of 
the partners who resigned from oconnor amp hannan on thursday 
the council voted 102 to drop the law firm effective jan 15 
ending a 500000 a year legal contract 
after the slaying of six jesuits last month in el salvador a 
group of protesters organized under the banner of the oconnor amp 
hannan campaign persuaded a majority of the council to support a 
resolution cosponsored by council members carol johnson and brian 
coyle 
johnson a primary author of the resolution to end the citys 
contract with oconnor amp hannan called the lawyers resignation 
a courageous decision 
the other partners who quit are william mcgrann whose office in 
washington dc represents the salvadoran leader douglas 
carnival and andrew shea and associate lawyer kathleen lamb 
the five who make up the minneapolis offices lobbying 
division are among the bestknown legislative lobbyists in the 
state oconnor amp hannan represents many public bodies including a 
minneapolis city agency 
oconnor amp hannan has said it did not do legal work for 
cristiani and provided only public relations and congressional 
lobbying arranging meetings for salvadoran officials with key 
federal lawmakers and journalists 
a spokesman for the law firm did not immediately return a phone 
call friday 
mcgrann and franzen said in an interview thursday the decision 
to resign came after some clients had voiced their uneasiness with 
the firms link to cristiani and the lawyers own personal and 
professional convictions compelled them to quit 
the clients said we keep reading about your law firm every 
day and we dont like what were seeing were uncomfortable about 
that mcgrann said the whole thing led to making it very 
difficult for us to do the kind of work we do generally in the 
public sector without it impacting our clients or at least our 
clients felt they were being impacted 
franzen said the group plans to establish a law firm and 
continue serving our clients as best we can 
we want to state our belief that mr cristiani has a right 
to counsel and that right extends to lobbying the us congress 
but the lawyers said they did not want to be involved in that 
effort and were unable to convince the firm to drop cristiani

art buchwald wants 5 million to teach 
paramount pictures a lesson his lawyer said friday the columnist 
claims the studio stole his script idea and turned it into the 
movie hit coming to america 
paramount took buchwalds idea titled king for a day and 
transformed it into the 1988 eddie murphy comedy which grossed 
more than 150 million the lawyer said in opening arguments of the 
trial being conducted without a jury 
we seek substantial punitive damages to teach paramount and 
others like it a lesson not to treat creative people like this ever 
again said attorney pierce odonnell 
murphy the attorney said already has netted 22 million from 
the film and paramount collected more than 50 million in 
distribution fees but he said the studio refused to pay buchwald 
and producer alain bernheim 250000 plus a small share of profits 
under their original contract 
sadly the evidence shows that even a towering literary figure 
like art buchwald is prey to an unscrupulous major movie studio 
the attorney said to superior court judge harvey schneider 
an attorney for paramount robert draper ridiculed the idea 
that buchwalds script idea was plaigarized 
he said it was different and that it never occurred to ned 
tanen the head of the studio that there was any similarity 
between the two ideas both of which dealt with an african prince 
coming to the united states 
draper acknowledged that during the year in which the case was 
pending murphy who is not a party in the lawsuit admitted that 
he had seen buchwalds proposal but murphy said he couldnt tell 
whether it influenced him subconsciously in writing his own script 
for coming to america 
what theyre claiming i think is that eddie didnt 
intentionally rip them off but in his subconscious he ripped them 
off draper said in his opening statement 
a memphis tenn man laurence armour filed a 40 million 
lawsuit in january against murphy claiming the movies plot was 
stolen from him and writer shelby gregory also has claimed the 
story as his

the communist party proposed a 
multiparty system free elections and full membership in western 
economic institutions including the european community according 
to a declaration drafted friday 
the end to the authoritiarian socialism has come said the 
declaration which also called for constitutional guarantees to 
bring marketoriented economic reform establish an independent 
judiciary and protect human rights 
the document prepared for adoption at next months national 
party congress and published by the borba daily appears to be 
yugoslavias reply to the wave of democratic reforms currently 
sweeping eastern europe 
the communist party of yugoslavia supports freedom of 
assembly speech and all other civil liberties regardless of 
political convictions of individuals said the document released 
by a preparatory committee 
political associations movements or parties will depend on 
the will of the citizens whose freedom of choice must be 
guaranteed by the constitution the declaration stated 
it said that the communist party will no longer retain its 
monopoly on power and will participate along with other parties in 
free direct and secret elections 
we are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow will 
not be too late for socialism in yugoslavia the document stated 
adding that the reforms should be implemented within six months 
after the congress 
until now the communist leadership of yugoslavias largest 
republic of serbia was the staunchest opponent of westernstyle 
democracy in yugoslavia but at its congress on friday serbias 
communist party appeared to have softened its hardline stance 
communists and serbian authorities have no reason or wish to 
administratively impede the establishment of independent 
political parties in the republic said bogdan trifunovic the 
regions party chief in his keynote address 
serbias rejection of westernstyle democracy has been shared to 
date by yugoslavias military which contended that opposition 
parties would be formed along ethnic lines thus fueling ethnic 
tensions 
however gen ivo tominc on friday was quoted by the official 
tanjug news agency as saying that the army would not stand in the 
way of the countrys democratic development and that it would 
adjust itself to the changes in the society 
the secondlargest republic of croatia and liberal northern 
slovenia have already endorsed parliamentary democracy and are both 
scheduled to hold free legeslative elections next spring 
independent movements and parties have been formed in croatia 
and slovenia in the past year despite resistance from authorities 
several opposition groups have also sprung up in serbia bosnia 
macedonia and montenegro where communists have in the past tried 
to sidestep democratic reforms 
the draft congress declaration also said yugoslavia will seek 
full participation in integration processes in europe and 
membership in the european community the council of europe the 
european free trade association and other similar organizations and 
institutions 
yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its 
oneparty system 
but political economic social and ethnic problems have 
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of president josip broz tito 
whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together the 
divergent ethnic groups in the country 
in an unprecedented move serbia last month severed all business 
and political ties with slovenia after authorities there banned an 
antislovenian rally planned by thousands of serbs 
the serbian move was generally seen as an attempt to isolate 
slovenia and prevent its liberal ideas from spreading all over the 
rest of the country 
the economic blockade of slovenia is contrary to the 
implementation of economic and political reforms and the reform of 
the party in yugoslavia said gen tominc in the first open army 
criticism of the serbian move according to tanjug

an agreement between the environmental 
protection agency and the army corps of engineers that would have 
begun to carry out president bushs campaign pledge to preserve 
wetlands will be held up for 30 days the administration announced 
friday 
the two agencies will use the extension to allow for 
explanations and discussion with federal agencies that have raised 
concerns about the agreement and to clear up any 
misunderstandings about the purpose of the memorandum epa said 
in a statement 
the memorandum of agreement which was reached in early november 
and scheduled to take effect friday has caused a split within the 
administration the departments of energy and transportation oppose 
the agreement and the council on environmental quality and the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration are in favor 
the interior department denied reports that the agreement had 
sparked a fight in the department between the fish and wildlife 
service and the minerals management service spokesman steven 
goldstein said the only concerns we have are procedural 
bush had promised during the campaign to strive for a goal of 
no net loss of wetlands 
in a letter to bush on thursday the president of the national 
wildlife federation said the way in which the white house handles 
the epacorps agreement will demonstrate whether or not you are 
truly commited to a national wetland policy of no net loss 
there is no middle ground on this one its either up or 
down wrote jay hair 
the agreement has faced stiff criticism from the oil industry in 
alaska and the alaska congressional delegation who fear it could 
disrupt oil and gas production on the north slope and cripple that 
states economy gov steve cowper has threatened to sue if the 
agreement isnt changed 
many conservationists have grown increasingly concerned about 
the disappearance of wetlands such as swamps bogs marshes 
potholes on the great plains and tidal estuaries 
according to some estimates up to 400000 acres of wetlands per 
year have been lost in recent decades to housing devlopments 
farms shopping centers highways and other encroachments of a 
modern economy 
but wetlands buffer floods purify streams and provide wildlife 
habitat for many species that cant life elsewhere 
federal law requires that the corps grant a permit before 
developers may put fill in most wetlands epa may challenge the 
decision and has certain veto powers over it and the two agencies 
frequently had been at odds 
the corps agreed in the memorandum to strive to avoid adverse 
impacts and offset unavoidable adverse impacts to existing aquatic 
resources and for wetlands will strive to acheive a goal of no 
overall net loss of values and functions 
the epa in its statement said the memorandum does not define 
a no net loss policy but rather establishes a clear sequence of 
actions to be considered in the existing permitreview process 
under the agreement permit applicants would first have to seek 
alternatives to disturbing wetlands and if none were available 
would have to work to minimize damege to wetlands 
if the project would still cause significant harm the applicant 
would have to compensate for the loss perhaps by building new 
wetlands or restoring old already damaged areas

the founder of the recruit co accused of bribing 
officials by selling them cutrate stock shares went on trial 
friday along with a former aide and two politicians in a scandal 
that toppled two governments 
hiromasa ezoe whose publishing conglomerate became the name of 
the scandal told judge tadatsugu watanabe and a team of some 20 
prosecutors that his gifts of discount shares and cash to 
influential public figures were not meant as bribes 
the 53yearold ezoe and former recruit executive toshiro ono 
39 both said they had absolutely no intention of bribery but 
apologized for the trouble resulting from the recruit scandal 
which brought down two prime ministers and has severely shaken 
public confidence in the nations leadership 
takao fujinami a former key cabinet minister and katsuya 
ikeda formerly a lawmaker with the opposition komeito clean 
government party also pleaded innocent to receiving bribes from 
recruit but begged forgiveness for getting involved in the scandal 
if convicted the defendants could be sentenced to five years in 
prison 
their trial is the last of five trials against 12 executives and 
expublic officials that began last month as the tokyo district 
court delves into allegations of corruption in the nations elite 
the recruit scandal which began in the summer of 1988 brought 
down prime minister noboru takeshita and his successor sousuke 
uno coupled with an unpopular sales tax it remains a serious 
problem for the governing conservative party which faces a general 
election sometime next year 
in the packed courtroom friday ezoe responded to prosecutors 
accusations by denying that he provided political donations and 
cutrate shares to fujinami and ikeda as bribes to win favors from 
them prosecutors must prove the intention of bribery in order to 
get convictions 
along with the other three defendants he accused prosecutors of 
forcing him to admit to bribery charges under duress the 
prosecutors questioned me from morning to night when i tried to 
close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the point that 
they hurt so bad that tears were flowing he said 
i was questioned for over 20 hours and suffered physical and 
mental damage said ezoes former aide ono who also protested 
his innocence 
ezoe is being tried on seven counts of bribery and ono on two 
counts 
fujinami 57 who was chief cabinet secretary when recruit was 
allegedly seeking to win special treatment for its fastgrowing 
employmentinformation and telecommunications businesses admitted 
he received from recruit 140000 and 10000 shares in its real 
estate subsidiary recruitcosmos 
but he said he didnt personally accept the gifts or provide 
special favors to ezoe 
i would never think of doing that in my position as chief 
cabinet secretary fujinami said in his brief statement due to 
his involvement in the scandal fujinami has left the liberal 
democratic party but retains his seat in parliament 
recruit offered millions of discount shares in recruitcosmos to 
hundreds of politicians bureaucrats and businessmen before the 
stocks were available to the general public 
when the shares hit the overthecounter market their price 
shot up and the insiders made big profits fujinamis shares were 
said to have earned him 215000 
ezoe said friday he had no idea the stocks would become so 
valuable after their release to the public 
ikeda 52 who resigned from parliament over the scandal 
vehemently denied having any connection with recruit and said he 
had not personally accepted 49000 in political donations or the 
5000 recruitcosmos shares supplied to his brother 
prosecutors charges that he gave speeches in parliament as a 
favor to recruit were absolutely untrue ikeda said i gave 
those speeches on my own initiative and based on my personal 
convictions 
prosecutors presented hundreds of pages of evidence against the 
four defendants in the trial which is expected to drag on for 
years as the legal system considers the fine line between cordial 
businessgovernment ties and outright corruption

three infants abandoned in the area in 10 
days including one found with a poignant note may have been left 
by their parents because of financial and emotional pressures of 
the season specialists said friday 
it would seem that somebody who abandons a newborn is somebody 
whos totally overwhelmed and feels they have no resources said 
irene goldenberg a family psychologist at uclas neuropsychiatric 
institute abandoning a baby is a case of pure panic its like a 
suicidal impulse 
the three infants now in foster homes seem to support findings 
that child abandonment has grown as much as 300 percent since 1980 
on wednesday a 5monthold boy was found behind a state 
disability insurance claims office building along with a note that 
said dear friends please look after my son i simply cant 
give him the kind of care he deserves i know you can it was 
written by the father who signed his name but has not been located 
the same day a man who stepped into the morning cold to get his 
newspaper found a newborn girl wrapped in blue cloth and placed 
inside a cardboard box in a gutter hospital workers named the 
infant noel 
a girl believed to be 2 to 3 days old was found dec 7 at a 
motel in suburban van nuys apparently left on a bed by a young 
couple who told the hotel desk they needed to rent a room briefly 
police said the only clue to her identity was the paper hospital 
gown decorated with pinkandblue teddy bears she wore 
while experts dont see a rise in child abandonment during the 
holiday season they say that a time of merriment and celebration 
of family unity can prompt feelings of severe depression and 
hopelessness fron those without support 
people who give up their children in hopes that a stranger will 
give them a better life may be relying on the christmas spirit of 
giving said sylvia pizzini of the child welfare services program 
of the california state department of social services 
people may feel others are more generous at christmas she 
said they count on the spirit of goodwill 
as police officers searched for the parents of the three 
foundlings los angeles social workers on friday held the annual 
adoption day on which 25 families received adoption decrees for 28 
children 
many public and private agencies offer adoption services where 
parents can surrender children they are unable to care for but 
people continue to abandon children anonymously because they are 
ashamed of their inability to raise the child said alex morales 
spokesman for the childrens bureau of los angeles the bureau 
places abandoned children in foster homes 
it is so much more socially negative to make that move he 
said its somehow more permissible to leave a child with a note 
maybe what goes on in the mothers mind is that she takes this step 
because of the social stigma that shes not a good mother 
morales said although babies being left on doorsteps get far 
more publicity many parents leave their children with strangers or 
relatives and disappear only to return later to claim the child 
it seems like drugs are playing a big part in that 
phenomenon morales said we see children abandoned because a 
parent is so caught up in their drug involvement they cant attend 
to the needs of their children 
after children are placed in foster homes or relatives are given 
custody the parent returns to be reunited with his or her child 
only to disappear again later he said 
often they are locatable which leads you to conclude that 
they want to be found said ms pizzini that biological tie is 
there through thick and thin

the roads and hillsides winding through 
antietam national battlefield are to be softly lit saturday night 
with 23110 candles one for each soldier killed wounded or 
missing after the civil wars bloodiest battle 
its a memorial and christmas is the season of lights we just 
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect richard 
rambur battlefield superintendent said friday everybody talks 
about 23000 but not very many people really have an idea of how 
many that is 
up to 5000 automobilies are expected to join a 45mile tour of 
the battlefield near sharpsburg about 70 miles west of baltimore 
candles glowing inside lunchsized paper bags filled with sand will 
outline the roadways and others will dot the snowcovered 
3200acre battleground 
more men were killed or wounded at antietam on sept 17 1862 
than on any other single day of the civil war union losses were 
12410 and confederate losses totaled 10700 it was the single 
bloodiest day of american military history 
youre really going to get an impression of what kind of 
impact that was rambur said when they drive through here 
theyre going to feel something im sure 
in addition to the bags of lighted candles choirs will be 
singing at various spots in the battlefield including the dunker 
church the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought 
to occupy and control high ground at the site 
a civil warera encampment complete with uniformed reenactors 
recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago the 
soldiers will gather at bloody lane a sunken road near the center 
of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than 
5000 dead or injured 
neither side gained a decisive victory in the battle of 
antietam but the conflict climaxed the first of confederate 
general robert e lees two attempts to carry the war into the 
north the battle also gave president abraham lincoln an 
opportunity to issue the emancipation proclamation which freed all 
slaves in the united states in 1863 
an estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups 
historical organizations scouting troops and area businesses have 
assembled the lights said washington county tourism director bob 
oconnor the battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups 
assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting 
1000 candles and retrieving them after the fivehour display 
all 23110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and 
dark oconnor said we dont know of any battlefield where 
this has been done to this magnitude he said 
rambur said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a 
somber attitude while lighting the candles 
this is a memorial and were trying to stress that we do not 
want santa clauses and that kind of thing rambur said if we 
learn anything from the battlefields it is that there just has to 
be another answer to war

the stateside units helped local officials in joint patrols and 
maintaining an 11 pm to 6 am curfew in effect since the storm

a circuit judge has ruled that the citys 
yearold loitering ordinance aimed at street drug dealers is 
unconstitutional 
the law is vague and overbroad and violates the fourth and 14th 
amendments of the us constitution brevard circuit judge john 
antoon decided this week the fourth amendment gives citizens 
rights against unreasonable search and seizure and the 14th 
amendment guarantees the right to due process for any us citizen 
the ordinance adopted in december 1988 made it unlawful to 
loiter in or near melbournes streets or public places in a manner 
for engaging in drugrelated activities 
melbourne city officials stand by the law which was closely 
modeled after a longstanding ordinance adopted in tacoma wash 
that had withstood scrutiny 
we wouldnt have adopted the ordinance if we had not felt it 
would meet that test city manager samuel halter said thursday 
city attorney jim reinman plans to meet with brevardseminole 
state attorney norm wolfinger within the next week to discuss an 
appeal halter said 
only one person had been charged under the ordinance and the 
case against him was dropped when the officer who arrested the man 
left the police department and failed to appear in court halter 
said 
antoon wrote in his order while the city has passed this 
legislation with the noble goal of reducing drugrelated crime it 
has also given law enforcement and the state carte blanche 
authority to prosecute innocent people exercising fundamental 
personal liberties

a catholic gubernatorial candidates switch to 
a proabortion stance prompted ohios catholic bishops friday to 
criticize politicians who personally oppose abortion while 
tolerating it publicly 
we cannot judge the state of anyones conscience before god 
we control no votes except the ones we cast personally said a 
statement read by cincinnati archbishop daniel pilarczyk at a news 
conference at st peter in chains cathedral 
but it is clear to us that objectively speaking the 
tolerance of abortion in our society and the refusal to allow 
religious and moral principles to influence public life are 
positions which are both morally and socially wrong the 
statement said 
pilarczyk who is president of the national conference of 
catholic bishops said the ohio groups statement was prompted by 
gubernatorial candidate attorney general anthony j celebrezze 
jrs change from an antiabortion to prochoice public position 
celebrezze a democrat and catholic announced his position 
switch dec 2 then announced his candidacy for governor monday he 
said he still personally opposes abortion 
many politicians have grown fearful of jeopardizing their 
candidacies with antiabortion stands in california last month an 
underdog catholic candidate for the state assembly won a narrow 
victory after a bishop barred her from taking communion because of 
her support for abortion rights 
celebrezze was followed by antiabortion pickets this week as he 
opened his campaign for the 1990 democratic nomination with 
appearances in 14 cities concluding his tour friday in 
springfield he said he values the bishops opinion but sees 
abortion as an issue of individual vs government choice 
i respect the bishops tremendously celebrezze said the 
question here is what makes good public policy i think we need to 
do a lot more to prevent unwanted pregnancies 
i strongly oppose abortion the issue that people are reacting 
to is who makes that decision i believe its an intensely 
personal decision to be made by the woman with the advice of a 
doctor family friends whomever but the government should not 
make that decision 
pilarczyk is chairman of the ohio catholic conference which 
includes bishops from all of ohios six dioceses he said the 
statement which did not refer to celebrezze by name was intended 
for all holding or seeking public office 
this is not just addressed to mr celebrezze one might 
say that mr celebrezze was the occasion of it but he was not the 
cause of it pilarczyk said in an interview 
its intended for all those to whom it applies its intended 
to teach what the church teaches and its intended to teach those 
in public life that they should not attempt to divorce moral 
principle from public policy 
signing the statement with pilarczyk were the other diocesan 
bishops in ohio james a griffin columbus james r hoffman 
toledo james w malone youngstown albert h ottenweller 
steubenville and anthony m pilla cleveland 
the statement was also signed by andrew pataki bishop of the 
eastern rite church in parma and louis puscas head of the 
romanian rite church in akron

organization of american states to our allies in europe and 
japan rangel said 
the lawmakers all members of the house narcotics abuse and 
control committee also met with colombias defense and justice 
ministers the national police director the attorney general 
colombian presidential candidates and us ambassador thomas 
mcnamara 
in our meetings with them it was apparent their determination 
and the determination of the courts was there to apprehend drug 
traffickers and clamp down on the production of cocaine and crack 
said rep lawrence coughlin rpa the ranking republican on the 
committee 
rangel the panels chairman was joined by reps benjamin a 
gilman rny and christopher shays rconn 
aides kept the twoday trip secret out of concerns that the 
congressmen could become the targets of cocaine traffickers who 
have been blamed for a rash of violence that has wracked bogota 
the capital 
among those killed have been 50 judges two newspaper 
publishers the chief of the narcotics police and a leading 
presidential candidate a bombing earlier this month wounded an 
estimated 1000 people 
barco traveled to washington sept 2829 for discussions with 
bush and house leaders about american cooperation with the war on

opposition activist vaclav havel 
said friday that if he is elected czechoslovakias first 
noncommunist president in four decades he will try to prevent a 
communist witch hunt 
there must be justice but not revenge said havel the 
playwright and leader of the opposition civic forum in an 
interview with the state news agency ctk i would try my best to 
avoid a witch hunt in this country including communists 
his comments followed word of a deepening split inside the 
ruling party between hardline and reformminded members that could 
lead to the establishment of a new democratic party 
the communist party has 17 million members all of them are 
our compatriots and there are countless people among them who are 
among the same as we are and who want this country to live in 
democracy said havel 
rudolf prevratil spokesman for the recently founded reform 
communist group democratic forum told ctk that next weeks party 
congress will show whether this movement can live inside the 
communist party 
reform members of the party are anxious to distance themselves 
from the discredited regime of exparty chief milos jakes and 
former hardline president gustav husak who resigned last sunday 
after swearing in czechoslovakias first government not dominated 
by communists in 41 years 
since then a dispute has developed over how to elect the 
president under the constitution the president is to be chosen by 
the parliament within two weeks 
but the communistdominated parliament is reluctant to vote for 
havel and is considering a proposal to throw the election open to 
popular vote negotiations are under way to resolve the dispute 
between the opposition and leaders of the communist and other 
smaller parties 
a final resolution is not expected until after parliament 
reconvenes dec 19 and an extraordinary party congress is held next 
wednesday and thursday 
the interview with havel is the first in a series to be 
conducted by the state news agency which is moving toward greater 
independence from the communist party 
the real presidential campaign has begun the agency said 
adding that interviews would be conducted with all those considered 
leading contenders 
these include alexander dubcek architect of the prague 
spring reforms who was ousted in 1969 after the soviet invasion 
cestmir cisar the student candidate for president in 1968 later 
expelled from the communist party and ladislav adamec 
czechoslovakias prime minister until nov 7 
havel said he did not want the race to drive a wedge between 
himself and dubcek or between czechs and slovaks 
he said his priority if elected would be to guard the quiet 
peaceful and dignified nature of the social movement which some 
call a revolution and not let it be sullied by intrigue 
politicking and all kinds of dirt

the food and drug administration wants to 
prohibit manufacturers from using the word hormone on the 
labels of nonprescription skin products 
labeling such as hormone cream implies that the product has 
a therapeutic effect by altering the structure or function of the 
body the fda said 
however the agency said that while nonprescription skin creams 
can contain hormones they are at low levels that have not been 
shown to have any therapeutic effect 
under the fdas proposed ban manufacturers could not refer to 
their products as hormone creams or say they contain 
hormones but they would be allowed to include in their regular 
listing of ingredients the names of hormones in the product as 
long as they are not listed prominently 
the fda has published the proposal in the federal register but a 
final rule is not expected to be issued for a year a spokeswoman 
said 
the ban would take effect six months after the final rule is 
published but the fda is asking manufacturers to comply 
voluntarily with the proposal before the rule becomes final

nearly onefifth of hispanic families are 
living in poverty as the decade ends according to a study released 
friday that contends the economic expansion of the 1980s has least 
benefited us latinos 
the study by the national council of la raza found widespread 
poverty among hispanic families led by women deepening hardships 
for marriedcouple families and significant numbers of poor latino 
children 
hispanics made many gains in the 1980s politically and 
socially especially in visibility and growth said la raza 
president raul yzaguirre but unfortunately the economic picture 
for hispanics worsened at the same time 
la raza a nonprofit hispanic research and advocacy 
organization said hispanics were concentrated in lowwage jobs 
overrepresented in industries with declining employment and more 
likely to lose their jobs through plant closings 
hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country 
with only 51 percent of latinos 25 and older completing four years 
of high school or more compared with 78 percent of nonhispanics 
the increasing number of hispanic families led by women is also 
a factor as those families tend to be poor the study said in 
1980 218 percent of hispanic families were led by women but by 
1988 womenled families accounted for 234 percent of hispanic 
families 
while 19 percent of hispanic marriedcouple families with 
children were poor in 1988 59 percent of womenled families were 
poor the study said 
among whites 64 percent of marriedcouple families were poor 
while 382 percent of womenled families were living in poverty 
last year said the study which was based on census bureau data 
among blacks 125 percent of marriedcouple families were poor 
while 563 percent of womenled families were in poverty 
the study said 129 percent of white families were led by women 
in 1988 while 435 percent of black families were headed by women 
the study found hispanic marriedcouple families had median 
incomes of 25769 in 1988 significantly lower than the incomes 
earned by black marriedcouple families 30424 and of whites 
36883 
the 1980s were also a period of significant poverty among 
children the study said and hispanic children were among the 
hardest hit 
the study found 442 percent of black children living in poverty 
last year compared with 379 percent for hispanic children and 
146 percent for whites 
the study said the concentration of hispanics in lowwage 
unstable jobs was one of the most significant factors contributing 
to latinos economic disadvantages in the 1980s 
about onethird of all employed hispanics work in agriculture 
mining manufacturing and private households while onefifth of 
the entire workforce is employed in those areas 
the study said evidence also indicates hispanics have 
experienced significant levels of employment discrimination 
throughout the decade 
the hispanic population has grown from 145 million to 201 
million from 1980 to 1989 accounting for 82 percent of the total 
us population hispanics make up 76 percent of the us 
workforce

it when its going to open up said volunteer duane mcshane

noon temperature was 4 degrees below zero 37 below with wind 
chill factor according to the national weather service

the last link of a 675 million freeway 
has opened more than 30 years after its proposal set off years of 
bickering and court fights 
the final link of the walter p reuther freeway opened to a 
flood of cars thursday evening reuthers daughter elizabeth 
dickmeyer and the man who originally proposed interstate 696 
former highway director john mackie attended the ceremony 
reuther a former president of the united auto workers union died 
in a 1970 plane crash 
the final 91mile section was finished this month and was the 
last link of the 282mile 675 million freeway the road is 
expected to carry more than 100000 vehicles daily at first with 
that number growing to 170000 daily cutting eastwest travel time 
north of detroit by as much as 30 minutes state officials said 
interstate 696 which borders 16 cities was first proposed in 
1957 
but the section between interstate 75 and lahser road had to go 
through seven communities and it was up to them to decide which 
routes to choose among five or six alternatives they couldnt 
agree according to paul garceau deputy district engineer for the 
michigan department of transportation 
in 1966 thengov george romney held a marathon meeting with

an aids test will be routinely performed as part 
of all autopsies in new york city and the information will be used 
to warn contacts of the deceased who may be at risk health 
officials said friday 
they emphasized that the identity of any body that tests 
positive for hiv the aids virus would be kept confidential as 
required by the states aids confidentiality law 
thus the medical examiners office will not report names of 
aidspositive corpses to the city health department but it will 
pass on such information as sex race age and neighborhood to help 
studies of how and where the incurable disease is spreading said 
dr charles s hirsch the chief medical examiner 
the only people to know names will be counselors who follow up 
to warn sex or drugabusing partners of the aidspositive dead that 
they may have been exposed the counselors will be trained and made 
available to hirsch by the health department but will be under 
hirschs command said dr stephen joseph city health commissioner 
hirschs office estimated that at least 1000 of the 
approximately 8000 post mortems performed annually will turn up 
hiv infection about 75000 people die each year in new york but 
the medical examiner takes jurisdiction only in cases when deaths 
are violent suspicious unexplained or occur without a doctor in 
attendance 
the aids testing will be put into effect at the medical 
examiners offices soon after meetings with various aids advocacy 
groups said ellen borakove speaking for hirsch 
the groups representing racial ethnic and social populations 
hardest hit by aids have generally resisted on privacy grounds 
any forms of involuntary testing or disclosure 
were going to reserve comment until we find out just how it 
is going to work said geoffrey knox spokesman for the gay mens 
health crisis 
joseph developed the plan with hirsch and said he could see no 
sane reason to oppose it 
what argument can anyone make to not warn the unsuspecting 
partner of someone who is dead said joseph 
he and hirsch both have said that because of recent gains in 
treating the disease infected people reached early enough may 
expect longer and better lives

aoun who refuses to recognize the new administration and give up 
control of the christian heartland 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem appeled on televised 
to christians in east beirut and the christiandominated coastal 
zone to the north to renounce aoun and help reunify lebanon he 
said a new round of the 14year civil war could begin at any time 
my brother in the eastern area i can guarantee that i am not 
going to declare war on you but i cannot guarantee that the war is 
not going to explode again hoss said 
hrawi 64 was elected president by parliament on nov 24 with a 
mandate to carry out a peace plan negotiated in october aoun a 
maronite catholic like hrawi has rejected the election and the 
accord demanding a specific timetable for withdrawal of the 40000 
syrian troops in lebanon 
a government statement said future army payrolls would be 
handled by gen emile lahoud who was appointed army commander last 
month after hrawi dismissed aoun 
it said the central bank would not pay army salaries unless the 
five brigade commanders in the christian enclave submitted monthly 
payrolls to lahoud within five days 
hrawi controls the central bank in moslem west beirut 
officials loyal to aoun urged all institutions and employees to 
reject directives and instructions which are null and void from 
those who deal with the occupiers meaning the syrians

guarantee peace as long as the secessionist movement led by 
general aoun exists we have learned from past experience that wars 
simply explode without anyone declaring them 
he called aoun 54 a mutineer who is leading the nation 
toward final partition merely because he is hungry for power 
most of lebanon is controlled by syria whose soldiers are in 
the country under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate aoun and

a widely circulated report by the national 
research council on pesticides used by farmers included information 
that was deficient outofdate and in some respects onesided a 
private researcher said friday 
however leonard p gianessi of the washingtonbased nonprofit 
resources for the future said that despite what he perceived as 
shortcomings the nrc report issued sept 7 makes an important 
contribution to the debate over the use of chemical pesticides 
perhaps my expectation was that it would provide answers to 
most of these questions as well it doesnt he said it 
probably should be viewed as an important first try to get on top 
of this issue and not as the final word 
the 450page nrc report cited case studies of farmers using 
alternative methods of production without the indiscriminate use of 
chemicals among its many proposals was one for congress to revise 
federal farm policies so that environmentally sound production 
methods would be encouraged 
environmentalists and many others applauded the report based on 
a threeyear 625000 study by a 17member committee the kellogg 
foundation put up 410000 for the study and other financing 
included 80000 from the agriculture department 
gianessi presented his paper at a briefing on the nrc report 
held by resources for the future an independent group founded in 
1952 its specialty is research in development conservation and 
use of natural resources 
in his critique gianessi said the nrc a branch of the 
national academy of sciences used case studies that were data 
deficient in making its case for alternative ways of producing 
farm crops and livestock 
information is often not presented for such key factors as 
how often do these alternative farmers simply abandon fields 
because they are too weedy how much pesticide use is there on 
these farms the report hints at these questions but doesnt 
provide any real quantified answers he said 
also gianessi said the case studies were for the 1986 crop 
year and the report came out in 1989 
the farms are referred to as if they are currently sustaining 
their successes for 1986 he said 
one of these farms has gone out of business at least two 
others have had to abandon key parts of their successful program 
because of the emergence of a new pest in florida and the 
withdrawal of a key pesticide in california

being discussed by france and south africa 
the idea is to get them out of here as soon as possible

process of returning to a more normal situation toward democracy 
denard and the other european mercenaries boarded a south 
african military plane four hours after the french landing and left 
for south africa 
they trained and led the 600man presidential guard and had 
controlled the comoros since president ahmed abdallah abderrahmane 
was assassinated nov 26 
most comorans believe denard and his mercenaries who first put 
abdallah in power in 1978 were responsible for his death denard 
has said a bodyguard accidentally shot abdallah 
south africa and france had been the two largest aid donors to 
the comoros a former french colony south africa which has 
extensive economic interests in the nation had financed the 
presidential guard

the bush administration dismissed on friday as 
a charade the promotion of panamas gen manuel antonio noriega 
as head of government 
as the united states has not recognized the noriegaled 
government since february 1988 the action by the peoples assembly 
changes nothing a state department official said 
american officials are under orders to have no dealings with the 
panamanian government on grounds that such actions would be 
illegitimate 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger asked about the 
action by panamas peoples assembly told reporters 
this is a charade and nonsense as far as were concerned at 
least there is no government in panama anyway 
for noriega to be named head of a nonexistent government at 
least in the view of the united states government is putting him 
in charge of nothing eagleburger said 
the us view is that the term of the last constitutionally 
elected national assembly in panama expired on aug 31 and that the 
body that promoted noriega has no legal or popular standing the 
state department official said 
he added that the 510 members of the assembly none of whom 
opposed noriegas appointment all were selected on the basis of 
their loyalty to him 
noriega has been wanted by us authorities for almost two years 
on drug trafficking charges

for the first time in its 143year history 
the smithsonian institution is trying to attract corporate support 
for its vast educational and research activities as a permanent 
supplement to federal financing 
the smithsonian recently announced the creation of a corporation 
associate program starting next year and intended to raise more 
than 1 million annually through corporate contributions or 
membership dues 
the founding chairman of the new fundraising venture will be 
roberto c goizueta chairman and chief executive officer of the 
cocacola co 
cocacola pledged the maximum 25000 in membership dues under 
the new corporate program which allows companies to cosponsor a 
major special event at the smithsonian corporations choosing to 
pay annual dues of 10000 will be entitled to vip treatment at 
smithsonian events 
in the past corporate support of the smithsonian has been 
confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or 
projects the new program is intended to generate unrestricted 
funds for the whole range of smithsonian activities including its 
14 museums and art galleries the national zoo and various other 
educational and research facilities 
smithsonian officials said the institutions current 
congressional appropriation of 2667 million is insufficiet to 
finance several ambitious new initiatives 
these include attracting more hispanics blacks and other 
minorities developing exhibits focusing on cultural diversity 
environmental and conservation projects and celebrating the 500th 
anniversary of columbus discovery of america 
federal funds including 30 million in government grants and 
contracts account for 83 percent of the smithsonians current 
budget of 3584 million 
net income from nongovernment smithsonian trust funds which 
include endowments and donations from individuals foundations and 
corporations is expected to total 617 million 
the estimate of corporate donations in the current fiscal year

unrestricted corporate and foundation gifts last year not 
earmarked for any specific use was only 16 million

presidentelect patricio aylwin said 
friday he will exert his authority over the millitary and gen 
augusto pinochet who intends to retain command of the army when he 
leaves the presidency march 11 
aylwin said he would meet with the military service commanders 
who have ruled chile since a coup in september 1973 to establish a 
working relationship 
scattered disturbances broke out friday in downtown santiago 
groups of young leftists threw rocks at police who responded 
with water cannon and tear gas skirmishes scattered shoppers and 
halted traffic several times on the principal boulevard alameda 
avenue 
the protesters demanded immediate release of leftists imprisoned 
on charges of political violence including many accused of 
guerrilla activity police reported at least 20 arrests 
aylwin soundly defeated two opponents in thursdays election at 
a news conference he pledged to exercise the full powers of the 
president and the armed forces must be subordinate and obedient to 
the president 
later friday aylwin told hundreds of thousands of supporters at 
a santiago rally that the armed forces political role must end 
in march when he takes over we want to see the armed dedicated 
to their professional duties disciplined obedient thus 
recovering the respect of all their compatriots 
his comment went to the heart of one of the new civilian 
governments most difficult and sensitive problems the 
considerable power that still will be held by the armed service 
commanders particularly pinochet as head of the 60000man army 
a special provision of the constitution pinochets government 
wrote in 1980 says the commanders cannot be dismissed until 1998 
aylwin 71 won 552 of the 7 million votes cast thursday as 
the candidate of a 17party alliance of the center and left hernan 
buchi the progovernment candidate got 294 percent and francisco 
javier errazuriz a wealthy enterprenneur 154 percent 
lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary of state said in 
washington we are enthused that the elections were free 
and fair we are very very pleased that chile has returned to 
democracy 
in brussels the european community hailed aylwins victory as 
the return of a great and friendly country to the path of 
freedom 
at his news conference aylwin said chile is effectively 
moving back to democracy there will be no puppet democracy and 
there will be no extrademocratic control over my government 
he said he would talk with military leaders as soon as 
circumstances permit 
under the new government the military will have a majority on a 
national security council empowered to represent its views to 
the government in addition a bill now being discussed by 
pinochets junta would give the armed forces substantial autonomy 
under the civilian leadership 
aylwin expressed confidence that a reasonable formula could 
be found but declared nothing will prevent me from fully 
exercising the presidential powers 
one of the most delicate issues in future militarycivilian 
relations is expected to be how aylwin handles the investigation of 
human rights abuses under the pinochet regime 
we dont have a wish of revenge but of truth and justice 
he said friday he also said anyone who committed abuses may be 
brought to justice including pinochet 
the 74yearold general says he will not accept human rights 
trials of military men and has issued a clear warning if one of 
my men is touched the state of law will be broken 
after overthrowing president salvador allende an elected 
marxist who died during the coup the military embarked on severe 
repression of leftists who had supported him thousands were 
arrested many tortured or killed and others forced into exile 
in his campaign aylwin emphasized plans to lead a government of 
national unity that would attempt to overcome bitter social and 
political divisions created by the coup and military rule 
he indicated friday that he would seek support from conservative 
groups to repeal or make democratic changes in laws enacted by the 
junta aylwin was careful to declare however that he would govern 
with the 17 parties of the alliance he led to victory 
his alliance will have a 7248 majority in the 120seat house of 
deputies it won 22 of the 38 elected senate seats but pinochets 
constitution gives his government the right to appoint up to 10 
more senators 
complex election laws written by the junta caused many leftist 
candidates to lose their races despite getting more votes than 
rightist opponents 
aides to pinochet said the laws were designed to ensure a 
healthy minority presence in congress opponents said the purpose 
was to prevent changes in the constitution which require a 
twothirds vote in both houses

francois mitterrand invited george 
bush to lunch saturday on this sunsplashed french island in the 
caribbean and residents are expecting a windfall of tourist 
dollars from the publicity 
this is a historic situation for st martin said albert 
fleming mayor of marigot the capital we have never had two 
presidents together 
bush and mitterrand will hold a twohour meeting and working 
lunch at an exclusive sun resort on st martin 140 miles east of 
puerto rico 
us and french officials have announced no agenda for the 
talks but the two leaders are expected to discuss the latest 
developments in eastern europe including the reopening of borders 
between east germany and west germany the french president has 
cautioned against a push for a reunified germany saying it could 
upset the european balance of power 
mitterrands invitation to bush was in return for a visit the 
french leader made in may to bushs home in kennebunkport maine 
on arrival at princess juliana international airport on st 
maarten the dutch half of the island bush and mitterrand are to 
be flown separately by helicopter to lhabitation de longvilliers 
a 253room luxury hotel and marina at marcel cove on the 
northeastern coast of st martin 
a helicopter and scores of french presidential gendarmes and 
army troops patrolled the 150acre resort grounds friday checking 
incoming cars with a metal detector us security officers also 
were making rounds 
friday afternoon french security officers exploded a box found 
under a marina of the resort complex where mitterrand and bush will 
confer col jeanclaude gillot said it was determined later that 
the box found by divers during a routine surveillance had been 
empty 
about 100 people were briefly evacuated from the privilege hotel 
nearby 
at the meeting site workers set up a beachside tent for the 
leaders and hooked up communication cables 
bush and mitterrand wont be mixing with residents fleming 
said which explains the lack of the usual welcoming banners and 
bunting in the capital a few tourist shops however were selling 
bushmitterrand tshirts 
teres a little painting up a little taping up but basically 
thats for christmas fleming said 
similarly on dutch st maarten there was little evidence of 
the event although roger snow publisher of the chronicle 
newspaper said everybody is talking about it of course 
the island bush and mitterrand are visiting is a curious mix of 
french dutch and carribbean cultures 
st martin with its sidewalk cafes fashionable boutiques and 
strolling gendarmes in khaki shorts and kneesocks has been called 
a speck of france in the caribbean technically it is a 
subprefecture of the french overseas department of guadeloupe 
which has a status akin to a us state 
st maarten is part of the autonomous fiveisland netherland 
antilles dutch is the official language but few people speak it 
nearly everybody speaks english instead although the papiamento

the high court on friday threw 
out convictions imposed in the countrys longest treason trial and 
freed five black activists including three prominent 
antiapartheid leaders jailed since 1985 
scores of jubilant supporters including anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu welcomed the men as they passed through cape towns 
airport en route from robben island prison to their homes near 
johannesburg 
its a sign we are winning the struggle said tutu we 
knew that justice would prevail one day 
the three leaders of the united democratic front and one of 
their codefendants a church worker were convicted of treason in 
november 1988 after a threeyear trial they received sentences 
ranging from six to 12 years from a judge who contended the front 
sought to incite antigovernment violence 
the appeal court in bloemfontein overturned the verdicts against 
those four and seven codefendants convicted of terrorism six of 
the seven received suspended sentences but one muzi malindi was 
given a fiveyear term and sent to the robben island penitentiary 
malindi was a member of the vaal civic association an affiliate of 
the united democratic front 
hundreds of chanting wellwishers greeted the five at 
johannesburgs airport police used guard dogs to control the 
crowd confiscated banners and seized film from at least two news 
photographers 
the independent south african press association reported that a 
woman in the welcoming crowd was bitten by a police dog and that 
the rev allan boesak an antiapartheid leader was arrested when 
he tried to aid her police had no immediate comment 
a fivejudge appellate panel unanimously upheld defense lawyers 
arguments that the trial judge kees van dijkhorst improperly 
dismissed one of the two legal experts assisting him in the trial 
van dijkhorst asserted that law professor wa joubert was too 
sympathetic to the united democratic front because he had signed a 
frontsupported petition opposing a new constitution that 
entrenched racially segregated politics 
during the trial most of the defendants were granted bail but 
van dijkhorst repeatedly denied bail for the three leaders of the 
front a huge multiracial coalition formed in 1983 to campaign for 
black political rights 
we have not sacrificed more than so many others we do not 
feel bitter said patrick lekota one of the front leaders after 
being carried shoulderhigh through the cape town airport for 
us it does not stop here its the beginning of another chapter 
van dijkhorst ruled that the front was a revolutionary 
organization that conspired with the african national congress 
guerrilla movement to provoke violence in black townships in 1984 
in a bid to render south africa ungovernable the front was banned 
in february 1988 but most of its leaders have circumvented or 
defied the ban 
lekota 41 the fronts publicity secretary was sentenced to 12 
years in prison pope molefe 37 the fronts national secretary 
and moses chikane 41 secretary of the transvaal province branch 
were sentenced to 10 years the rev tom manthata 49 a church 
field for the south african council of churches was sentenced to 
six years 
we always believed in their innocence said the rev frank 
chikane general secretary of the church council their 
conviction and sentencing were examples of the grave miscarriage of 
justice which the apartheid courts of south africa hand down 
lawyers for human rights an association of civil rights 
lawyers hailed the appeal court ruling as an excellent victory 
that would help restore the credibility of the south african 
judiciary 
the group urged the government to disclose the cost of this 
abortive prosecution which took years of blundering incompetence to 
achieve nothing but red faces 
the trial began in 1985 in the farming town of delams and was 
shifted to pretoria eleven of the original 22 defendants were 
acquitted at various stages 
one of the activists lawyers david dyson said the appeal 
court ruling appeared to be based solely on legal questions and 
doubted it was related to the changing political climate created by 
president fw de klerks easing of curbs on opposition activity 
the trial entailed 439 days of court proceedings spread over 
more than three years the 368page indictment named more than 900 
alleged coconspirators ranging from tutu to african national 
congress leader oliver tambo there were more than 220 witnesses 
and the official court record contained about 30000 pages

investigators have found no evidence of 
jury tampering in the murder trial 26 years ago of a fertilizer 
salesman charged in the slaying of civil rights activist medgar 
evers 
charges against byron de la beckwith a white supremacist who at 
the time was a salesman in greenwood were dropped after two 
allwhite hinds circuit court juries were unable to reach verdicts 
allegations of possible jury tampering by a state agency recently 
were raised 
so far there is absolutely no evidence to indicate jury 
tampering assistant district attorney bobby delaughter said 
thursday none were contacted none were even aware that any 
contact had been made with their employers until after the fact 
delaughter who led the jurytampering investigation into the 
second april 1964 trial said he told a hinds county grand jury 
his findings thursday in a closeddoor meeting at the courthouse 
prosecutors now will turn their attention to beckwiths first 
trial earlier in 1964 although no allegations of jury tampering 
have been raised about that trial 
evers field director of the state naacp was shot to death june 
12 1963 outside his home in northwest jackson 
beckwiths rifle bearing one of his fingerprints was found 
near the evers home beckwith contended the rifle had been stolen 
from him 
delaughter said thursday that prosecutors are still trying to 
decide if the murder case itself can be reopened and new charges 
sought 
my opinion is unless we can have the benefit of the evidence 
available in 1964 and newly discovered evidence it would be 
extremely hard to get around the speedy trial question 
delaughter said 
beckwith 68 now lives in signal mountain tenn 
the district attorneys office investigated beckwiths april 
1964 trial after a jackson newspaper reported oct 1 that the state 
sovereignty commission the states segregation spy agency 
screened potential jurors 
what was done was the sovereignty commission investigator 
would call up employers and say what can you tell me about this 
person delaughter said 
while i consider it extremely unethical for one state agency 
to be working against state prosecutors it still is not a crime 
delaughter said 
the commission formed by the 1956 legislature died after its 
funding was cut off in 1973 
delaughter said he and others in the district attorneys office 
contacted 11 of the 12 jurors in the second beckwith trial and are 
seeking the other juror 
delaughter said he and investigators talked earlier with former 
sovereignty commission director erle johnston of forest and 
reviewed records johnston kept the commissions own records are 
sealed in a vault on orders of the 1977 legislature 
the rifle and all other evidence from the two trials are missing 
from the hinds county circuit clerks office 
but delaughter said theres no indication the evidence was 
stolen if cases are inactive for many years the law allows the 
evidence to be destroyed

independent judiciary 
the communist party of yugoslavia supports freedom of assembly 
and speech and all other civil liberties regardless of political 
convictions of individuals said the document written by a 
committee preparing for a party congress next month 
the party will relinquish its monopoly on power and take part in 
free direct and secret ballot elections the document said 
and we are changing all of this now in order that tomorrow it 
will not be too late for socialism in yugoslavia 
reforms specified in the declaration should be carried out 
within six months after the congress it said as published by the 
daily borba 
some opponents of change fear independent parties would be 
formed along ethnic lines and further exacerbate tensions in this 
tenuous federation of six republics and two autonomous republics 
communist leaders in serbia the largest of republic has 
resolutely opposed westernstyle democracy but appeared to soften 
the stance friday at a regional congress 
bogdan trifunovic serbian party chief said in a keynote 
address that communists and serbian authorities have no reason or 
wish to administratively impede the establishment of other 
political parties 
croatia the secondlargest republic the liberal slovenia in 
the north already have endorsed democratic reform both have 
scheduled free legeslative elections for spring 
numerous independent political movements and parties have been 
formed in croatia and slovenia during the past year 
despite official opposition several independent groups also 
have been formed in serbia bosnia macedonia and montenegro where 
communists have in tried to avoid reform in the past 
the serbian leadership has argued that oneparty rule was needed 
to control centuriesold ethnic conflicts that have boiled up since 
the death in 1980 of president tito who founded communist 
yugoslavia 
much of the recent unrest has centered on the province of 
kosovo where ethnic albanians form a majority of more than 90 
percent serbia is the largest republic and both of the nations 
provinces kosovo and vojvodina are part of it but not fully 
subject to its control 
kosovo which borders albania was a part of ancient serbia 
most of the christian serbs in the province view the moslem 
albanians as intruders and accuse albanians of harassing them

in europe and membership in the european community the council of 
europe the european free trade association and other similar 
organizations and institutions

the soviet union announced friday that it 
has 627500 troops abroad its first such disclosure of its foreign 
forces and said it would like to bring them home by the year 2000 
however soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky who 
made the announcement said the pullouts would not be unilateral 
and would depend on negotiations with other nations 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the statement 
was encouraging he said the us position is that all such 
matters are to be worked out at the conventional forces talks under 
way in vienna 
petrovsky did not give a breakdown of troop deployment and said 
it was well known that the troops were stationed in warsaw pact 
countries and in mongolia he did not elaborate 
next week soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is to 
meet leaders of the north atlantic treaty organization diplomats 
said they believed the troop strength announcement was intended to 
help pave the way for that visit 
under a unnegotiated agreement the soviet union withdrew 
more than 100000 troops from afghanistan and has said that all 
nations should agree not to station their soldiers abroad 
petrovsky declined to discuss possible troops withdrawals from 
eastern europe saying those were subject to negotiations in vienna 
a year ago soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced his 
nation would make massive unilateral cuts in soldiers and military 
equipment overseas 
petrovsky said that next year it is possible to conclude a 
practical agreement on withdrawal of conventional forces in europe 
but in order to achieve the aim of withdrawing troops to national 
boundaries it is necessary to use different bilateral and 
multilateral arrangements and talks he said

nearly one year after the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 investigators said friday they have assembled 
some clues to the international terrorist plot but are not close to 
prosecuting anyone 
what we are doing in effect is trying to piece together an 
international terrorist jigsaw said george esson a police 
official we have some of the pieces some we are trying to 
place and some we have yet to find 
esson spoke as scottish officials announced the first public 
inquiry to be held into the explosion of flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland on dec 21 1988 that killed all 259 people on board and 
11 people on the ground 
the inquiry to be held next year before an independent judge 
will be the first in which members of the public will have the 
chance to attend the proceedings a criminal police investigation 
and a transport department investigation alreday are under way in 
britain 
speaking at a news conference officials said one focus of the 
investigation is the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command a radical palestinian faction headed by 
ahmed jibril 
but they said other groups also were under investigation 
it would be right to say that we have focused our attention on 
one group but it would be unwise for us to exclude others esson 
said 
asked whether that one group was the pflpgc he said 
certainly 
jibril a former syrian army officer has denied involvement 
though he has said his faction has used devices like the one that 
brought down flight 103 
lord fraser scotlands senior law officer and esson chief 
constable of the dumfries and galloway constabulary told reporters 
they also are interested in mohammad abu talb a member of another 
radical palestinian group who is charged in sweden with four 
bombings in northern europe 
also friday in washington attorneys for families of 13 members 
of the flight crew filed a lawsuit alleging that two companies 
failed to provide adequate security the lawsuit says alert 
management systems inc and pan am world services inc which 
provided security at frankfurt and heathrow airports failed to 
comply with minimum security procedures 
in new york pan am spokesman alan loflin said the airline 
hadnt heard of the lawsuit 
esson said the police investigation has encompassed 52 countries 
and fraser said west germany malta and sweden have been the 
focus of important areas of investigation 
investigators have said the bomb was made of a plastic explosive 
packed in a radiocassette player in a suitcase loaded into a 
forward cargo hold of the boeing 747 
they released photos friday showing the reconstruction of the 
forward hold with a gaping hole and the reconstructed metal 
container which held the suitcase bomb 
fraser said significant progress had been made in identifying 
other contents of the suitcase including clothing 
he said he ordered the scottish public inquiry now because the 
police investigation had reached a stage where he thought it would 
be appropriate he did not elaborate but said the inquiry 
could be postponed or canceled if criminal proceedings appeared 
likely 
the public inquiry formally known as a fatal accident inquiry 
will be held next year although a date and a presiding judge have 
not yet been selected fraser said 
he confirmed he had requested swedish permission for scottish 
police to remove clothing from abu talbs swedish home reportedly 
to compare it with the recovered shreds 
i have at present no intention to seek the extradition of abu 
talb fraser said 
esson would not say how many individuals were under 
investigation nor whether all were arabs some are in a position 
where they could be extradited he said 
scottish police still believe the bomb either started or 
passed through frankfurt airport where the flight originated he 
said west german police maintain that has not been proven 
unconfirmed news reports have said the suitcase arrived in 
frankfurt on an air malta flight from the mediterranean island and 
was transferred onto the pan am flight without an accompanying 
passenger 
esson said he believed police will obtain enough evidence to 
prosecute the bombers but said there are more investigations to 
be conducted 
the photographs released friday were of sections of the plane 
painstakingly reconstructed from wreckage scattered over 845 square 
miles to determine precisely how it was destroyed 
the reconstruction was done by the department of transports air 
accidents investigation branch based at farnborough southwest of 
london which will publish a report on its findings in the first 
half of 1990 
one photograph shows the fuselage including the forward cargo 
hold area where the suitcase bomb exploded the section 55 feet 
long 27 feet high and 25 feet wide shows a gaping hole the metal 
is peeled back illustrating what investigators called the 
petaled out effect produced by the explosion 
another photo shows the reconstructed metal cargo container 
with the pan am insignia on the side in which the suitcase had 
been loaded onto the plane

district attorney harry connick was indicted 
by a federal grand jury friday for allegedly aiding a new orleans 
bookie by returning seized gambling records 
eight others were also named in the indictment for running or 
aiding the 2000 a day sports gambling operation they included 
convicted bookmaker walton k aucoin 49 of new orleans and former 
assistant us attorney patrick fanning who is now aucoins 
attorney 
also indicted were actor paul burke 63 wilson p abraham 70 
a new orleans real estate developer william g condon 34 no 
address steven bertolino 57 no address iris ethridge 30 no 
address and darleen aucoin toca 27 no address 
condon bertolino aucoin ms ethridge and ms toca were 
charged with owning and conducting an illegal gambling operation 
fanning abraham and burke were accused of aiding the operation by 
helping connick devise the excuse for returning the records to 
aucoin 
the excuse was that aucoin needed the records to pay his federal 
taxes specifically to file his december federal gambling stamp 
tax returns 
us attorney john volz said that since the indictment included 
fanning who worked with him in the federal prosecutors office in 
new orleans the case was being handled by the justice departments 
public integrity division from washington 
burke a new orleans native who was in the movie valley of the 
dolls and ms ethridge also were charged with perjury for 
allegedly lying to the grand jury investigating the case 
connick district attorney in new orleans since 1974 denied any 
wrongdoing at a news conference attended by about 150 of his staff 
members and supporters he accused volz of carrying out a personal 
vendetta complete with brown shirt tactics 
the us attorneys office is using the justice department in 
washington dc to do his dirty work for him connick said 
connick said he would not resign and would run for reelection 
to a fourth term next year even if the case is still pending he 
said he did not expect the indictment to affect his handling of his 
office 
im not going to roll over and play dead for john volz or 
anybody else connick said sparking enthusiastic applause from 
the crowd of supporters 
when the grand jury investigation surfaced in january connick 
said the probe centered on the way the bookmaker aucoin got 
copies of the betting sheets seized in a dec 4 1988 raid on his 
apartment 
at the time connick said he received telephone calls on behalf 
of aucoin from fanning abraham and burke and he acknowledged that 
he got copies of the gambling records for aucoin 
there is nothing unusual nothing illegal about a prosecutor 
returning to the accused his property or copies of his property 
connick told the news conference 
he denied having been advised by his staff or police that 
returning the property would help a gambling operation 
despite being advised by the new orleans police and his own 
staff that defendant aucoin needed the bookmaking records solely to 
pay and collect the illegal bookmaking debts and to continue the 
illegal gambling business without disruption defendant connick 
without examining records and before the case had been referred to 
or accepted by his office for prosecution ordered the return of 
copies of the bookmaking records to defendant aucoin who he had 
been informed was one of the largest bookmakers in louisiana the 
indictment said 
connick also told fanning he would attempt to get aucoins 
jaguar returned to the bookmaker despite being advised by police 
that aucoin used the car in paying and collecting gambling debts 
the indictment said 
all the defendants face a maximum 25 years in prison and a 
500000 fine if convicted the perjury counts could net burke and 
ms ethridge an extra five years and 250000 fines each 
volz has denied any personal grudge he refused to elaborate on 
the indictment at a friday news conference 
aucoin was released the same day of his 1988 arrest without 
having to post bond he was described by police as a threetime 
convicted bookmaker who catered to high rollers 
connick acknowledged that the day after the arrest he asked 
police for copies of gambling records at fannings request 
connick contended he acted in accordance with state criminal 
procedures which he said allow defendants to see evidence against 
them so their attorneys can prepare a defense 
aucoin had not been charged at the time connick did not 
formally charge him until after the us attorney wrote in a jan 
24 letter that the grand jury had made connick a target in their 
investigation 
frank disalvo attorney for fanning said friday his client has 
done nothing wrong abraham did not immediately return a telephone 
call to his home there are no telephone listings for the other 
defendants in the new orleans directory

treasury secretary was named to replace economy minister nestor 
rapanelli gonzalez served briefly in the central bank as a vice 
president and has been in the cabinet as minister of health since 
menems may 14 election 
menems former campaign manager julio mera figueroa was 
appointed interior minister to replace eduardo bauza who was named 
minister of health figueroa is a longtime strategist in menems 
peronist party

economist 
the cabinet shakeup followed a 6week plunge of the austral on 
foreign exchange markets soaring interest rates strikes by 
teachers doctors court clerks and other public employees for 
higher wages and rekindled inflation 
menems tax reform and 1990 budget proposal have stalled in 
congress and organized labor stepped up its criticism that two 
stabilization plans imposed since he took office in july were aimed 
at curtailing inflation by forcing workers to accept cuts in real 
wages 
last week menem officially devalued the austral and raised 
public service rates again he angered businessmen by increasing 
taxes on exports and suspending for two years the repayment of 
principal on internal bonds 
labor leaders politicians and businessmen were cautious in 
their assessment of the political shakeup 
it was unavoidable said guerino andreoni codirector of 
the 3 millionmember general confederation of labor 
osvaldo cornide director of the argentine chamber of merchants 
said rapanelli had concentrated on curtailing inflation to the 
exclusion of other important goals such as controlling interest 
rates and wage levels 
gonzalez a member of the small christian democrat party is the 
third economy minister in menems government the first miguel 
roig died of a heart attack six days after he was sworn in 
gonzalez appointment was expected to appeal to organized labor 
and factions of the peronist party that disagree with menems plans 
to reduce state expenditures sell public companies lower tariff 
barriers and increase taxes 
aldo ducler a rapanelli aide who also resigned called the 
departing economic team a dike against the demands of those who 
resisted the modernization of the economy 
rapanelli 60 is a former executive of the bunge and born grain 
trading multinational synonomous with big business in this 
south american country it is viewed with distaste by unions and 
leftist elements within menems party 
his resignation has been expected since the free market austral 
plunged to 1560 per dollar on thursday from 1020 the week before 
meanwhile supermarkets and other stores began to mark up prices 
drastically in anticipation of inflation projected to top 30 
percent in december the november rate was 65 percent the october 
rate 56 percent 
mera figueroa is a former national deputy with long ties to the 
peronists during the 1970s he was aligned with its leftist 
factions and imprisoned for three years following a 1976 military 
coup 
after the restoration of democracy in 1983 mera figueroa worked 
within the party and was an early backer of menem then a 
provincial governor

rules of conduct for the city hall press corps 
scardino a former new york times reporter who won a pulitzer 
prize for editorial writing told reporters that dinkins places a 
high value on courtesy and mutual respect and would like to be 
addressed as mr dinkins at press conferences 
scardino said reporters also should raise their hands when they 
want to ask questions and be recognized before doing so rather 
than blurt them out in competition with other journalists 
i would be grateful to you if you would please respectfully 
pose your questions mr dinkins hell respond to you 
scardino said at the third in a series of press briefings he has 
set up during the transition of government from the koch 
administration 
i would appreciate it if you would please try to restrain 
yourself and not ask out of turn he said 
asked if dinkins had complained to him about the way the press 
asked its questions scardino said no he has not 
dinkins said later he did not mind how reporters addressed him 
he said he did not know scardino was going to make such a request 
and had not asked him to do so 
however he said i do think it would be useful if reporters 
were not discourteous to each other 
at mayor edward i kochs news conferences reporters tend to 
call him mr mayor mayor or your honor koch seemed 
amused by the whole thing when he learned about the request 
i wonder what it would have been like if they called me mr 
ed like a horse koch said

us national income figured on the basis of 
population rose slightly in 1988 but was far outpaced by japan 
the world bank reported friday 
per capita income in the united states last year was 19780 
compared with 18580 in 1987 in japan the income rose from 
15840 to 21040 the world bank said the bank gave all incomes 
in us dollars 
the world bank arrives at its figures by dividing the value of a 
countrys total production the gross national product by its 
population per capita income thus includes people without income 
such as children and nonwage income such as returns on 
invstments 
the swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a 
1988 average of 27260 up from 21310 in 1987 
mozambique ranked lowest among the 152 members of the world bank 
with a 1988 annual per capita income of 100 
the united states which in 1987 ranked second only to 
switzerland in per capita income was fifth last year behind 
switzerland japan iceland and norway the figure for iceland was 
20160 while in norway it was 20020 
much of the rise in the japanese income can be attributed to an 
increase in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar as 
well as to increased japanese production elsewhere differences 
could be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared with 
other currencies the dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fall 
that began in 1985 
one former world bank economist who spoke on condition of 
anonymity cautioned that the figures should not be taken to 
reflect living standards 
in sweden people have to spend 15 percent of their income 
fighting the climate he said thats not the case in italy 
italys per capita income was 13320 for 1988 compared with 
10430 the previous year swedens was 19150 up from 15610 
the bank gives no figure on per capita income for the soviet 
union which is not a member country however the cia puts it at 
8850 well behind 12480 in east germany and 10140 in 
czechoslovakia 
china and india rank low on the list with an average income of 
less than a dollar a day 330 a year the per capita in the 
african countries of benin was 340 a year and 360 a year in kenya 
china reported the fastest growth rate 9 percent between 1986 
and 1988 while kenyas income grew by only 15 percent and benin 
declined 45 percent 
that does not take in account such illegal production as drugs 
and other goods made for the black market or wages that are 
unreported to avoid taxes it has been estimated that this 
underground economy can account for as much as a third of some 
countries incomes 
the world bank atlas 1989 also reported on some 
qualityoflife elements 
japan was at the top in life expectancy a japanese baby born in 
1988 could expect to live to age 78 compared with 77 for a swiss 
french or swedish baby 75 for a us baby 69 for a soviet and 42 
in such poor african countries as guinea or sierra leone 
literacy varied widely somalia niger and north yemen reported 
in 1985 the latest figures available that only 12 percent to 14 
percent of their people could read and write 
unesco reports that the literacy rate is 95 percent or higher in 
america the soviet union and the more prosperous countries of 
europe china reported a 69 percent literacy rate 
many poor countries have reported big jumps in school enrollment 
between 1970 and 1986 from 56 percent to 80 percent in china and 
from 7 percent to 50 percent in north yemen

insisted friday that his forces had raided a syrian army base in 
south lebanon though plo headquarters condemned the attack 
thursdays attack which lebanese police also blamed on arafats 
mainstream fatah group threatened to undermine efforts to end a 
sixyear rift between arafat and syrian president hafez assad 
police reported 15 people were killed and 43 wounded when 
palestinian guerrillas from fatah the biggest faction in the 
palestine liberation organization attacked syrias military 
intelligence headquarters in south lebanon at the village of rmaile 
the operation was carried out by palestinians no lebanese 
took part in the attack said the fatah commander who identified 
himself only by his nomdeguerre of abumaher 
he said fatah commanders in south lebanon prepared the attack 
without consulting arafat 
no one knew about it at plo headquarters in tunis he said 
in an interview in sidons ein elhilweh refugee camp 25 miles 
south of beirut it is the main plo base in lebanon 
a statement issued thursday by plo headquarters in tunis 
tunisia denounced the attack without explicitly denying that fatah 
members were involved 
the statement said the plo had ordered an investigation in 
collaboration with the other factions in sidon to identify the 
authors and commanders of the attack 
as chief of the plo umbrella group arafat presides over several 
factions of guerrilla fighters who sometimes launch independent 
attacks or war among themselves 
syrian officials in damascus made no comment on thursdays 
fighting which undermined efforts by arafat and assad to achieve 
longelusive arab unity before convening an international middle 
east peace conference 
about 150 of abumahers fighters reportedly stormed and 
ransacked the syrian base three miles north of sidon to free

gov mario cuomos drug treatment czar 
under fire for alleged shoddy management of his agency and helping 
friends obtain lucrative state contracts resigned friday 
the embattled bureaucrat former heroin addict julio martinez 
was quickly given a new state job by cuomo at a comparable 
salary 
martinez 45 one of the cuomo administrations highest ranking 
hispanics received 87338 as director of the state division of 
substance abuse services he will become head of the state prison 
systems drug treatment programs said cuomo spokesman gary fryer 
only a few hours earlier but before martinez had a lengthy 
meeting with several top cuomo aides a spokesman said martinez had 
no plans to quit 
martinez came under fire thursday when the state commission on 
government integrity after a yearlong probe outlined a string of 
alleged abuses and called for an overhaul of the martinezled state 
substance abuse division 
in his resignation martinez said the commissions report failed 
to present a complete and balanced view of his divisions work 
but the charges have effectively precluded my ability to provide 
strong and continuing leadership within the agency 
cuomo in a letter to martinez said the job he had held was 
undoubtedly one of the most difficult positions in public service 
anywhere in the united states 
the martinezheaded agency also had come under fire from the 
state comptrollers office and cuomos own management advisers the 
division announced a restructuring after that earlier criticism 
fryer said martinez got a new job because the governor has a 
very high regard for julio and always has julios ability to 
motivate and inspire people to seek and participate fully in 
treatment is a great asset to the state 
fryer also noted that in his new job martinez would not have 
the administrative burden he had in the old job 
martinez a native of puerto rico and a drug treatment activist 
in new york city was picked to head the states drug treatment 
efforts by thengov hugh carey in 1979 hispanic leaders recently 
had pressed cuomo to keep martinez in that post despite the 
critical reports about his agency 
traditionally cuomo doesnt fire cabinet members hes unhappy 
with they simply resign as martinez did 
the governor who is facing an expected reelection race next 
year has recently been trumpeting a major new state effort to 
battle drug abuse 
on thursday the cuomoappointed anticorruption commission said 
martinezs agency suffered from an intricate web of favoritism and 
infighting the commission said friends of martinez won 
milliondollar drugtreatment contracts that never led to any 
treatment 
three of four residential drug treatment programs investigated 
over the last year failed to open a single bed despite millions of 
dollars in state funding said the commission headed by fordham 
law school dean john feerick 
the ferrick commission said martinez over the objection of 
other top division officials frequently had intervened on behalf 
of friends and longtime associates to arrange funding for their 
proposed drugtreatment programs 
the evidence concerning all four programs under investigation 
indicates that a personal connection to director martinez or other 
executive staff members smoothed the way for dsas funding the 
commission said 
the commission report didnt call for martinez to be replaced 
spokeswoman linda sachs said friday that the commission has not yet 
decided whether to recommend a criminal investigation

branches of the armed forces 
chervov said the 1990 military budget is 709 billion rubles 
1148 billion compared to 773 billion rubles for this year

gonzalo rodriguez gacha the son of 
colombian peasants was a pig farmer who became one of the richest 
men in the world with profits from cocaine trafficking 
he was believed to have more than a billion dollars stashed away 
at the time of his death friday in a gunfight with police 
rodriguez gacha 42 was one of the leaders of the medellin 
cartel which along with the cali cartel is responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united states 
rodriguez gacha had a grade school education and went from pig 
farming to bartending in the 1970s he became a hired killer for a 
colombian gangster trying to gain control of emerald mines 
he became feared throughout the tropical areas of central 
colombia killing emerald buyers and stealing their wares 
he also became wealthy and surrounded himself with bodyguards 
and beautiful women 
about 10 years ago he became aware of the immense appetite for 
drugs in the united states and began using his emeraldwar profits 
to buy cocaine base from bolivia to be processed into pure cocaine 
by 1984 he had so much money he was giving some away 
when the southern city of popayan was devastated by a 1984 
earthquake rodriguez gacha was seen walking through the ruined 
city giving money to stunned survivors 
he and other major drug traffickers banded together to form the 
medellin cartel named after the northwestern city of medellin 
where smugglers traditionally had their headquarters 
rodriguez gacha had many ranches but perhaps his favorite was 
at pacho 50 miles north of bogota 
after the government declared war against the drug dealers last 
august when a presidential candidate was assassinated the army 
occupied the pacho ranch many peasants in the area told an 
associated press reporter at the time of the takeover that 
rodriguez gacha was generous 
they said he gave away thousands of dollars providing money for 
medical treatment and for seed and farm equipment when they could 
not get loans from the governments farm bank 
police acknowledged that rodriguez gachas popularity with 
peasants had made it difficult to trap him 
an american diplomat speaking with the condition of anonymity 
told journalists three months ago that rodriguez gacha and other 
traffickers had hundreds of people on their payrolls to help watch 
for police raids 
a vendor in a town square would be paid 50 a month to watch for 
security forces heading toward rodriguez gachas ranch the 
diplomat said and a police colonel might be paid 15000 a month 
for information 
but if rodriguez gacha was a saint to some colombians he was a 
monster to others 
authorities said he was behind the aug 18 murder of sen luis 
carlos galan one of the countrys leading presidential candidates 
who was shot down while addressing a campaign rally 
galan had called for more energetic action against drug 
traffickers 
rodriguez gacha also was responsibile for the killing in 1988 of 
jaime pardo leal leader of the leftwing patriotic union party 
authorities said more than 700 members of the patriotic union have 
been slain the past four years 
rodriguez gacha was accused of paying rightwing death squads to 
kill peasants suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas 
officials said rodriguez gacha was enraged by the guerrillas 
attempts to extort money from ranchers in areas where he owned 
property and vowed to exterminate them and any of their 
sympathizers

night at the fox theatre entertaining the crowd with lines from 
her role and a song to the tune of the tara theme 
hers was the biggest applause when the surviving cast members

antebellum costumes 
mary burleston of amboy ill wore her wedding dress altered 
with a hoop and green trim to resemble an 1860s ball gown her

why not said ms viola whose trip to atlanta was a christmas 
gift from her aunt

crowd was far smaller than the million or so who waited in the cold 
to see clark cable and vivien leigh on that friday night in 1939 
then the crowd was so thick that one man perched on a street 
sign for hours in hopes of catching a glimpse of the stars as they 
passed in a 30car motorcade on peachtree street to the loews grand

the texas court of criminal appeals on friday 
stalled defense attorneys efforts to have death row inmate 
clarence brandley released on bail ending his hopes of freedom by 
christmas 
the court which overturned brandleys capital murder conviction 
earlier this week ruled friday that a galveston judge would have 
to prove he had jurisdiction in the case before a bond hearing set 
for monday could take place 
defense attorney mike degeurin said the ruling essentially puts 
an end to efforts to free brandley before christmas or even 
before a third trial could take place 
the announcement of the prosecutors filing of a new trial 
effectively denies any hope of clarence brandley being freed or 
even coming off death row degeurin said 
montgomery county district attorney peter speers said thursday 
he would ask the appellate court to reverse its decision and 
failing that would retry brandley for the capital murder 
speers filed a motion with the court of criminal appeals asking 
the court to prevent the galveston judge from conducting the bond 
hearing in the meantime 
the appeals court said the galveston judge would have until jan 
2 to prove why he has jurisdiction to decide bail for brandley 
degeurin however said he had decided to withdraw his motion 
for bail from the galveston court he said brandleys release would 
be stalled until the court of criminal appeals issues a decision on 
the prosecutors request that it reverse its decision 
im disappointed that the prosecution hasnt gone ahead and 
dismissed the indictment and instead is seeking to keep clarence on 
death row while theyre asking for a reversal degeurin said 
brandley 38 was convicted in the rapestrangulation of 
16yearold cheryl dee fergeson of bellville who was killed in 
1980 while attending a volleyball tournament at conroe high school 
the appeals court wednesday set aside the verdict saying 
brandley did not receive a fair trial 
brandley who is black was a janitor at the school when miss 
fergeson was attacked miss fergeson was white brandley supporters 
contend the former janitors conviction was racially motivated 
brandleys first trial ended with a hung jury in the second 
trial an allwhite jury convicted him of capital murder and 
sentenced him to death he has come within six days of execution

police who had stalked him for months 
killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha one of the most powerful cocaine 
barons in a shootout friday near covenas a port on the caribbean 
rodriguez gacha his 17yearold son fredy and five bodyguards 
were killed in the shootout 360 miles north of bogota at a ranch 
owned by pablo escobar another kingpin in colombias 
multibilliondollar drug empire national police chief miguel gomez 
padilla said no mention was made of police casualties 
president bush called president virgilio barco friday night and 
congratulated him and the colombian police on the death of the 
42yearold trafficker gen miguel maza marquez said in a 
television interview 
the gunfight was at a ranch only 70 miles south of cartagena 
the city where bush is to meet in february with the presidents of 
latin americas three major drugproducing countries barco alan 
garcia of peru and jaime paz zamora of bolivia 
maza commander of the federal investigative police said police 
had been pursuing rodriguez gacha the no 2 man in the medellin 
cartel for 70 hours in the covenas coastal zone before catching up 
with him 
rodriguez gacha was on the list of a dozen colombian drug 
traffickers most wanted by the us justice department 
maza said telephone switchboards at police stations and the 
presidential palace were flooded with congratulatory calls 
the country and the world have received this news with 
satisfaction he said we know this because of the quantity of 
calls from citizens from women crying with joy because the head of 
the most dangerous and forceful terrorist organization on earth has 
just died 
but he said rodriguez gachas death would not end terrorist 
violence in colombia 
we cannot say that we have broken the back of organized crime 
but since its head has lost its brain what follows will be a 
little easier he said 
police will know concentrate efforts to capture escobar maza 
said we just need a little luck like we had today with rodriguez 
gacha 
escobar a former pickpocket who leads the medellin operation 
and remains at large was believed to be in the area of the ranch 
at the time of the shootout interior minister carlos lemos said in 
a televised interview 
lemos did not elaborate except to say sternly to the camera 
individuals who are involved in crime will end up like rodriguez 
gacha ended up 
escobar and rodriguez gacha nicknamed el mexicano because 
of his fondness for anything mexican have been the objects of 
manhunts by us and colombian authorities since barco ordered a 
crackdown on drug traffickers after a opposition presidential 
candidate was slain aug 18 
police earlier reported 11 bodyguards among the dead before 
downgrading that at a news conference to five 
the operation to locate rodriguez gacha was an intellegence 
operation of great care gen carlos arturo casadiego assistant 
director of the national police said in an interview with the 
caracol radio network 
in washington william bennett national drug control policy 
director said barco told him the news by telephone call 
bennett said the fugitives resisted police efforts to arrest 
them opening fire on colombian authorities colombian police 
returned fire killing rodriguez gacha his son and 10 or more 
cartel bodyguards

world leaders and human rights activists heaped praise friday on 
andrei d sakharov who sacrificed position for principle 
disdained his persecutors and became a universal symbol of the 
unquenchable human spirit 
the 68yearold soviet scientist and humanist died thursday 
night of an apparent heart attack in his moscow apartment 
on friday morning the soviet congress stood in a minute of 
silent mourning for a fellow member who first was a national hero 
for building the hydrogen bomb then reviled for insisting on human 
freedom and finally released from internal exile by mikhail s 
gorbachev in 1986 
one legislator called him a man such as maybe appears once in 
a hundred years 
president gorbachev with whom sakharov had several 
confrontations said he was a man of conviction and sincerity he 
was not some sort of political intriguer he was a person who had 
his own ideas his own convictions which he expressed openly and 
directly this doesnt mean i agreed with him although on many 
things we did agree 
president bush said all of us who knew him will never forget 
his courage and devotion to freedom in the darkest hours of his 
struggle for human rights in the soviet union he embodied all that 
is good and decent in the human spirit 
to margaret thatcher prime minister of britain sakharov was 
a remarkable person there was this fantastic courage and among 
the scientific people there was a tremendous capacity for original 
thought 
it did not stop with the science but went into freedom 
liberty politics and culture he worked so hard for everything 
that is coming to pass in the soviet union he was one of those who 
would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of 
stating that and letting everyone know 
it is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future 
of the soviet union 
lech walesa leader of polands solidarity trade union and a 
fellow nobel peace prize laureate said sakharovs death was a 
great loss for reform it is very bad that gods sentences are 
such we needed this man 
in a telegram to sakharovs wife yelena bonner he said the 
wave of reforms that he has fought for flows over all eastern 
europe today 
vaclav havel the human rights activist who appears close to 
becoming the new president of czechoslovakia said sakharovs work 
was one of the cornerstones of the future european home and 
worldwide understanding 
a towering figure of his time was how un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar described sakharov his life spanned a 
period of immense complexity and change in the history of his 
country perez de cuellar said 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki prime minister ingvar carlsson of sweden and 
ruud lubbers the dutch premier were among the many leaders who 
sent telegrams or praised sakharov 
president francois mitterrand of france sent a message to mrs 
sakharov saying her husband knew better than anyone else how 
to reconcile scientific discipline with humanist values he leaves 
the memory of a rouser of conscience and indefatigable defender of 
human dignity 
aase lionaes chairman of the norwegian nobel committee that 
awarded sakharov the peace prize in 1975 said he fell in the 
struggle for democratic reforms his death represents a great loss 
especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the 
soviet union and in all eastern europe 
norwegian painter victor sparre an old friend called sakharov 
the greatest reconciler of our century he gave his life for 
other peoples freedom 
we have lost our moral compass said roald sagdeyev former 
head of the soviet space program who worked with sakharov in the 
congress of peoples deputies and the soviet academy of sciences 
foreign minister moshe arens of israel said we are pained by 
the loss of the great fighter for human rights for the rights of 
soviet jews and prisoners of zion andrei sakharov will always be 
remembered as the man who deserves great appreciation by the jewish 
people 
natan sharansky who spent nine years in soviet labor camps and 
immigrated to israel in 1986 said sakharov had tremendous 
influence among dissidents among free people in the soviet 
union and by his own personal example helped change the whole 
climate in the soviet union 
marie staunton director of the human rights group amnesty 
international said sakharov represented a whole generation of 
people in what seemed at that time a hopeless situation 
everybody looked up to him his death is really the end of an era 
in beijing however chinas official media saturday carried 
only onesentence reports of sakharovs death without mentioning 
his role as the soviet unions leading dissident 
earlier this week in protests over the 1989 nobel peace prize 
awarded to tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama the chinese 
press also criticized sakharovs receiving the prize in 1975

president bush canceled a trip to manhattan 
and a speech friday night to the 80th convention of the naacp 
because he has laryngitis and there could be bad weather in new 
york 
even before the trip was scrapped bushs prepared address had 
been shortened to about eight minutes because of his ailment 
speaking briefly by telephone to the gathering bush apologized 
for not being there and said i will use my office to speak out 
against racism and bigotry wherever it is found 
stepping in at the last minute health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan quoted from portions of bushs speech 
white house officials also had considered the possibility that 
bush would go to new york and sit on the stage as his speechwas 
delivered by one of his aides roger porter 
in the end the white house said bushs laryngitis and 
deterioriating weather conditions in new york prompted the decision 
to cancel the trip the national weather service issued a storm 
warning for new york and predicted possible heavy snow 
accumulating four to six inches along with heavy winds 
the white house said the prospect of poor visibility would have 
curtailed plans for bush to fly by helicopter from newark to 
midtown manhattan 
the announcement of the trips cancellation came too late for 
dozens of members of the white house press corps they had flown 
ahead of the president on a chartered airliner and were landing in 
newark when the decision was made to drop the trip and for them to 
return

cbs facing a third season as no 3 in prime 
time ratings reached agreement friday with movie executive jeff 
sagansky to be its new programs chief sources close to the 
negotiations said 
the move comes two weeks after the resignation of his 
predecessor kim lemasters who resigned as cbs entertainment 
president after only two years in the job 
although cbs officials declined to comment and a spokesman for 
sagansky said there is no announcement yet one executive who 
asked not to be named said saganskys hiring would be announced 
monday by cbs and columbia studios 
the delay the executive explained was to allow for an 
orderly transition at both companies columbia based in burbank 
calif owns tristar pictures of which sagansky has been 
president since march this year 
cbs agreement with sagansky had been expected but it was 
delayed by extended negotiations between cbs and columbia studios 
for the release of sagansky from his tristar contract cbs 
officials have said 
ironically cbs previously considered him for the job before 
deciding on lemasters in 1987 sagansky was wooed again before and 
after cbs unsuccessfully bid last week to lure to its vacant job a 
top tv production team marcy carsey and tom werner their company 
makes nbcs the cosby show and abcs roseanne the nations 
two highestrated series 
sagansky who will be responsible for cbs entire program 
schedule faces a large task of restoration in coming months at the 
oncedominant network that last month suffered its worstever 
november ratings 
although its daytime schedule emerged first in the november 
ratings sweeps cbs prime time programs latenight the pat 
sajak show and cbs this morning all were third in network 
ratings 
however the morning program usually third in ratings even when 
cbs enjoyed prime time success showed slight improvement when its 
ratings were compared with those of november last year 
in prime time though cbs slipped twotenths of a ratings point 
in november it averaged a 120 rating a full ratings point behind 
abc and 31 points behind firstplace nbc 
a ratings point represents 921000 homes and in prime time can 
be worth between 120 million and 140 million annuallly to a 
network 
the results of the quarterly sweeps periods are most important 
to affiliates which use them to set their own advertising rates 
for the next three months 
although some cbs programs like murphy brown and the 
recently returned beauty and the beast have gotten critical 
praise cbs hasnt had a hit series since the debut of murder 
she wrote in 1984 
in news dan rathers cbs evening news broadcast once 
usually first in ratings also is showing signs of slipping 
abcs world news tonight has won in ratings for the last two 
weeks in the last ten weeks that broadcast anchored by peter 
jennings has won eight times and tied twice with rathers program 
in the nielsens

a soviet envoy on friday rejected a us 
appeal for a joint effort to repeal a 1975 un resolution that 
equates zionism with racism 
we consider that there is no need for this kind of action 
deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky told a news conference 
responding to a question he said his government would not join 
the united states on behalf of israel to repeal the measure 
because if this question will be raised there no doubt will be 
confrontation in the united nations and that will go far beyond the 
discussion of middle east questions and have a negative effect on 
the whole state of affairs in the united nations 
vice president dan quayle told un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar monday that the united states is seeking repeal of 
the arab and sovietbacked resolution 
the united states and soviet union have frequently worked 
together this year to achieve consensus instead of calling for 
divisive votes 
washington recently lauded the soviet union for urging arab 
nations to back away from demanding national observer status for 
the palestine liberation organization

the soviet union is eager to enter into

the 11 soviet petroleum officials were on a twoday trip to the 
oilrich permian basin in west texas to see how americans pump 
hardtoget oil from the ground the soviet union is the worlds 
largest oil producer but increasingly is having problems 
recovering crude from marginal wells 
if we are able to execute one joint venture tonight we will 
have considered our mission here to have been a success yuri 
vershinin senior engineer for a siberian oil and gasproducing 
region said at a vendors reception wednesday night 
i am absolutely certain we can work together said vitali f 
lasnichi senior engineer for the soviet ministry of oil and gas 
adding that both sides can learn from each other 
representatives from 60 us companies from oil titans to tong 
manufacturers attended wednesdays reception though no 
jointventure deals were struck for soviet oil exploration 
joint ventures are possible because soviet petroleumproducing 
regions have autonomous power to execute their own deals using oil 
in place of hard currency said louis mazzullo who coordinated the 
tour for the west texas geological society 
the value of the ruble is kept artificially high by the soviets 
preventing the currency from being converted on foreign exchange 
markets 
ampir s sytrlanov senior engineer for the bashkiria producing 
region in the ural mountains said he was interested in joint 
ventures in horizontal drilling 
other soviet officials said they were interested in gaining 
american expertise in enhanced oil recovery deep drilling gas 
processing and recycling and hydrogen sulfide safety 
its difficult to execute business deals in three days 
mazzullo said but at least the ground work for future business 
dealings between the permian basin and the soviet union has been

staten island residents won the chance to 
secede from new york city under a bill signed friday by gov mario 
cuomo 
there are no dispositive substantive arguments offered 
against the bill cuomo said 
the bill gives staten island residents the chance to vote next 
year on whether to establish a commission to draw up a new 
government after at least three years the actual question of 
secession and the form of a new government would go to the voters 
again 
secession has long been sought by some residents of new york 
citys smallest borough who complain they have little voice in 
city affairs compared to residents of more populous manhattan the 
bronx brooklyn and queens 
staten island nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide is 2 
times the size of manhattan yet the 400000 mostly middleclass 
residents of the island are only a fraction of the citys 7 million 
residents 
i want to congratulate the governor on his prudent decision 
said state sen john marchi a staten island republican and chief 
sponsor of the bill it comes as an early christmas present for 
me and i believe for the people of staten island 
the secession movement gained steam last spring with a us 
supreme court ruling that new york citys form of government was 
unconstitutional 
staten islanders feared that a new government drawn up by a 
charter revision commission would give them even less power 
the secession bill was passed by the legislature on the final 
night of its 1989 session yet was held back from the governors 
desk for several months by marchi 
the measure was opposed by new york city officials worried about 
the loss of tax revenue from staten island residents mayor edward 
i koch argued that voters in the entire city not just staten 
island should vote on secession 
cuomo said that theres more than enough time to deal with 
the opponents objections 
he did however attach one condition to his signature cuomo 
said he wants new legislation requiring that any new charter that 
is adopted by staten island voters also be subsequently approved by 
the state legislature marchi has agreed to sponsor such 
legislation next year said his spokesman charles dumas 
new york city mayorelect david dinkins said staten island has 
been an integral part of the city since it joined in 1898 
the law allows the residents of the borough to reconsider this 
historic relationship dinkins said it is my hope that after 
they complete their evaluation they will choose to remain part of 
americas greatest city 
us rep guy molinari who becomes staten island borough 
president on january 1 said the chances of staten island 
eventually seceding are very very slim because if secession 
benefits the island financially legislators from other parts of 
the state wont approve it 
if it doesnt benefit staten islanders voters there would turn 
it down he said so it may be nothing more than a cruel hoax 
molinari said

ferdinand marcos the late deposed ruler of the 
philippines was found liable friday in the 1981 murders of two 
antimarcos activists in seattle 
marcos estate and his widow imelda were ordered to pay more 
than 15 million to the survivors of silme donigo and gene viernes 
family members and supporters of the plaintiffs cried as us 
district judge barbara rothstein read the unanimous verdicts and 
erupted in cheers when the judge dismissed the jurors 
the verdicts found marcos and his widow were part of a 
conspiracy and were negligent in a way that led to the shooting 
deaths on june 1 1981 in offices of the alaska cannery workers 
union 
a sixmember jury deliberated 5 hours before ruling on the 
involvement of the marcoses in the shooting deaths of domingo and 
viernes 
we were informed today that the jury in seattle has rendered a 
substantial damages award against the estate and myself mrs 
marcos said in a statement issued in honolulu we believe there 
are important legal issues in this case which will ultimately cause 
the verdict to be reversed our lawyers have been instructed to 
pursue all appropriate remedies 
the civil lawsuit was the first of several legal cases against 
the marcoses to go to trial in this country according to the 
marcoses attorney richard hibey of washington dc 
i myself thought that the case was one that could not be 
won hibey said there is an appeal already before the court 
michael withey lead attorney for the plaintiffs said he would 
ask state prosecutors to reopen the criminal investigation in the 
case 
three men were convicted of murder in 1981 and 1982 but on the 
theory that domingo and viernes were killed because of an internal 
dispute in the union of which they were reform officers 
clearly the foreign head of state of a country has been 
implicated in crimes committed in the united states withey said 
other countries such as el salvador and south africa better not 
try the same thing in the us 
jurors had to decide whether the marcoses were part of a 
conspiracy that led to the murders and whether they were negligent 
in exercising control over their intelligence network 
a unanimous verdict on either of those questions was sufficient 
to find marcos estate and mrs marcos liable and subject to 
damages 
survivors of domingo were awarded 12794000 while viernes 
survivors were ordered to receive 2254000 
attorneys for victims survivors had asked jurors to calculate 
the marcoses liability at about 10 million 
the civil trial had a lower standard of proof than the beyond 
a reasonable doubt proof required in criminal trials the 
conspiracy count required a showing of clear cogent and 
convincing evidence and the negligence count a showing of a 
preponderance of evidence 
rothstein will judge liability of the other defendants 
constantine baruso former president of the alaska cannery workers 
union who allegedly paid the murderers and whose gun was used in 
the killings dr leonilo malabed of san francisco a marcos friend 
who allegedly ran an intelligence slush fund that financed the 
murder payment and the three men convicted of the murders 
prosecutors who convicted the three in 1981 and 1982 contended 
domingo and viernes were killed because of an internal union 
dispute they had been elected as reformers of the alaska cannery 
workers union and reportedly had worked against gang influence on 
work assignments and gambling in alaska fish canneries 
but plaintiffs claimed the men were killed by an intelligence 
network headed by the marcoses that harassed and intimidated 
activists in the united states who opposed the marcos martiallaw 
regime 
in testimony during the 3week trial 
marcos in a video made before his death admitted he used 
four agencies to gather intelligence in the united states but he 
insisted they did nothing more than the normal intelligence 
gathering of all nations that he practiced maximum tolerance 
of his opposition and that he didnt become concerned about 
dissidence in the united states until about 1984 
marcos described malabed as a friend but invoked his fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination when asked about any 
intelligence connections with malabed and the mabuhay corp which 
allegedly was a cover for a slush fund that provided 15000 for 
the murders 
the marcoses face several other legal cases against them 
in october 1988 the marcoses were charged in a criminal 
indictment with siphoning more than 100 million from the 
philippine treasury and funneling it into this country for the 
purchase of new york real estate and art mrs marcoses trial is 
scheduled to begin march 14 in us district court in manhattan 
hibey said several claims also have been filed in various cities 
in which individuals are suing the marcoses because of torture or 
other abuses they allegedly sustained during the marcos regime

air fare increases that all took effect on the 
same day last fall are now being investigated by the justice 
department for possible antitrust violations 
government and industry officials said thursday that several 
airlines have been ordered to supply documents and information 
about their ticketpricing procedures 
the focus of the inquiry apparently is a system that allows one 
air carrier to signal its intention to raise fares giving others 
the opportunity to follow suit before the increase actually takes 
effect 
on sept 8 american airlines filed increases in fares into 
computerized systems read by thousands of travel agents and other 
airlines by the time the increases took effect on sept 29 
several other airlines had matched the hike with fares up 10 to 
80 depending on how many days before departure tickets are

to be of a lower social and economic status are more likely to be 
smokers 
there has been progress in reducing cigarette smoking but the 
study shows most of the progress is limited to the welleducated 
said dr luis escobedo of the atlantabased cdc who analyzed 
aspects of the survey released thursday 
the emphasis must become more targeted he said some of 
that already is being done through substance abuse programs 
tobacco is an addictive substance

near yuletide last year michael palin was 
returning to his london home and family he recalls the joyous 
cries of his children to wit got any presents i said ive 
been traveling light 
he sighs the shopping that was far far worse than traveling 
around the world in 80 days 
which is what the merryfaced member of monty pythons flying 
circus had been doing for the british broadcasting corp he 
emulated the famed globetrot of jules vernes fictional phileas 
fogg traveling only by land and sea 
he went by train cargo ship dhow ferry taxi camel even a 
passing sheiks new red mercedes no jumbo jets though he didnt 
mind i find air travel highly overrated usually late and a 
sheeplike form of transport 
starting jan 7 around the world in 80 days a sevenpart 
documentary series about his expedition will be shown sundays on 
cables arts amp entertainment network which bought it from the bbc 
since his python days palin has been in various movies some 
like time bandits and a fish called wanda with python 
pals he also has been writing including a tome for tykessmall 
harry and the toothache pills 
he made a wellreceived bbc series on train travel in 1980 but 
his roundtheworld voyage filmed with a crew of five was as a 
python would say something completely different what to wear was 
only the start 
theres no shop like circumnavigators inc he notes 
but the idea is to take as little as possible for him this 
meant six shirts three pairs of trousers and a small bag 
containing tapes and a diary book 
world travelers have been known to unwillingly visit the 
wretched nations of dysentary hepatitis and mysterious ailment 
so palin got an armful of shots having queried a globertrotter 
who advised just take everything 
he set off from london in the fall last year proceeding 
eastward via the orient express then varied forms of transport 
among them an elderly dhow whose engine failed at midnight in the 
persian gulf 
it sort of fizzled out and the captain sort of scratched his 
head and said oh the rubber band broke 
palin who at one point suffered food poisoning and several 
times found himself behind schedule also faced much suspicion by 
gimleteyed border guards in the middle east 
at such times he says its often best just to say im on a 
journey going somewhere else one guard asked palin why he was 
in dubai if going to tokyo he was told oh well thats a long 
story dont want to bore you 
the gate was raised off went palin amp co proceeding to bombay 
where he got a shave from a blind barber thence to singapore and 
the mysterious orient that included a hydrofoil trip up chinas 
pearl river and dinner at a small cafe that served only the meat of 
poisonous snakes 
they bring the snake to you in a little box set it down on 
the floor and execute it then and there 
a fast modern cargo ship brought him across the pacific to long 
beach calif and the foreverdocked queen mary where he spent a 
night 
amtrak carried him save for a hotair balloon ride in the 
rockies to new york he got home by ship the worst part of the 
whole voyage 
palin smiles well getting back to london was the worst part 
of the journey getting back just before christmas there was a lot 
of real mean spirit about the place i dont know if i was tired or 
something 
but people were christmas shopping and pushing each other 
there were ads everywhere and bands playing and electric bells 
ringing 
it seemed just utter madness after what id been through 
which was quite a long sea journey something calm and quite 
reflective it was as if my country didnt match up after a world 
of hospitality

michael jacksons brain is on a shelf 
paul simons elephant and tears for fears sun are tucked away 
elsewhere at music video director jim blashfields studio 
the brain is clay and appears in the video for jacksons song 
leave me alone the elephant which stars in the boy in the 
bubble video is a photograph acquired from a 1950s movie and 
the sun is really a 3inch paper cutout stuck to a wall since its 
appearance in the sowing the seeds of love video 
in the four years since jim blashfield amp associates began making 
music videos the director has raked in awards as well as business 
from such musicians as joni mitchell and peter gabriel and 
memorex public broadcasting service and even sesame street 
hes one of the top five video makers said jeff ayeroff 
president of virgin records us division i deal with this 
stuff every day so i know how good this guy is so much of what we 
see in videos is stupidly exploitative but his work is sort of a 
psychedelic celebration it makes you walk away and say geez 
that was interesting 
the jackson piece took a golden lion award the highest honor 
in the category of commercials short films and videos at this 
years cannes film festival it also won the 1989 mtv award for 
special effects 
mtv nominated that reel in five other categories and has 
nominated other blashfield videos sowing the seeds of love was 
no 1 on mtvs top 20 video countdown in october 
blashfields style features colors from some otherworldly 
crayola box coins and globes spinning through space and flying 
people 
essentially youre making up reality blashfield said 
in the jackson video the star moves through a surreal world of 
floating chairs huge chomping teeth and amusement park rides 
it took 25 people six months to make the video which clocks in 
at 4 minutes 45 seconds it features photo collage animation 
using 24 photographs per second and a total of 6840 photographs 
blashfields videos arent just giant grab bags of weird objects 
on film the jackson video tells a story jackson has become an 
amusement park and has been tied down like gulliver by the 
nuisances that come with megadoses of fame 
blashfield got started in the music video business in 1985 with 
the hit video for talking heads and she was 
on a whim his former producer and current houseboatmate 
melissa marsland sent a copy of their 12minute suspicious 
circumstances film to talking heads management company 
blashfield got a call a few days later asking if he would like to 
make the video for and she was he and his staff mostly 
parttime temporary employees and some freelancers had just 28 
days to make it 
it looked like it might be impossible blashfield said he 
got so nervous about the production that he once woke up in the 
middle of the night thinking oh god what have i gotten myself 
into did i actually say i knew how to do this 
blashfield described work on the videos as collaborative with 
producers handling finances and client relations supervising 
production and helping with creative work also involved are 
animators photographers artists and production assistants 
my job is to come up with ideas and kind of guide people he 
said 
until the talking heads video blashfield had been barely 
supporting himself with local commercials and documentaries 
animation and experimental films 
he is 45 now but his fling with film began at 19 blashfield 
had acted in high school and college productions and met a 
portland filmmaker john rausch through a play i thought god 
i could actually make those things that go up on the screen he 
recalled 
he often looks at photos or objects to develop ideas 
sometimes i can see things in my head but very often my head is 
not loaded with images once you get a seed of something it 
reminds you of things 
ideas also come from blashfields musician clients with whom he 
confers by telephone and in person later his staff spends two or 
three days getting the musicians on film 
blashfield and company went to los angeles to film michael 
jackson flying in a toy rocket at a soundstage but paul simon 
and joni mitchell traveled to portland for shooting 
theres no need to move to los angeles or new york to be at the 
top of his profession blashfield said 
im in a really fortunate position what youll find in la 
now is a lot of people trying to figure out how they could live in 
a place like portland and still do nationalbased work 
blashfields clients must meet his personal standards 
tears for fears qualified sowing the seeds of love is a 
humanitarian song with spiritual overtones the video includes a 
striking seemingly threedimensional scene of a multifaceted 
mandala a circular form symbolizing the universe in eastern 
religions 
these guys are very interested in matters of the spirit 
blashfield said and i find that i am increasingly too im 
starting to look around for where the other dimension to life is

aids may rob its victims of their health and 
eventually of their lives but volunteers are making certain the 
disease does not deprive them of their loving pets 
the pet owners with aids resource service called powars for 
short provides food fun and foster care for the dogs cats and 
other pets of new york city aids patients who are too sick to care 
for them 
peoples first concern has to be themselves once theyre 
attended to its time to think about their pet said steve kohn 
founder of powars 
by the time they get to us theyve been through a nightmare 
of federal state and local red tape were trying to take the 
chaos out of somebodys life he said 
kohn a city university of new york laboratory technician with 
two boston terriers founded powars in may 1988 with 2000 of his 
own money 
now he and about 200 volunteers help care for some 30 cats 20 
dogs a bird a ferret and fish the number of pets grows each 
week some clients get monthly food deliveries while others need 
occasional or constant litterbox cleaning supplies grooming and 
walking some veterinarians donate their services as well 
a few clients pay 10 or 15 a month most get supplies and 
services free thanks to donations to the taxexempt group 
when a client is hospitalized volunteers care for his or her 
pet in its own home or a foster home permanent homes are sometimes 
found when patients die 
it brings tears to my eyes the organization is so 
wonderful said phyllis a manhattan woman with aidsrelated 
complex who asked that her last name be omitted 
i know how much love i have for my animal i depend on her 
theres not as much intimacy with people sometimes she said of 
suzie her 3yearold mixed malteseyorkshire terrier 
a friend persuaded phyllis to call powars for help she 
resisted at first because i had a lot of pride i want to walk 
her as much as i can 
now powars provides food grooming and veterinary care for the 
fluffy white dog when i saw how accommodating nice and sincere 
they were i could let the help in phyllis said its possible 
i may need more of it sometime down the line 
tony who has aids gets help with his 10yearold yorkie 
herbie 
last summer tony was distressed about unemployment and medical 
bills on top of that i was worried about the dog he said 
then he learned about powars the service provided minor eye 
surgery for herbie something i couldnt afford its a comfort 
to know he is well i can be better part of it is stress he 
said 
i love this dog hes my friend and foe tony said 
playfully shaking the tiny dog who clearly adored him too he 
makes me laugh hes a little pal its better than living with 
humans sometimes 
tony had a heart attack in january when i got out of the 
hospital and i saw my dog i cried everything else is 
dispensable 
a neighbor took care of herbie that time but tony feels 
confident that powars will be there if a friend cant be 
another clients relatives asked powars for help the man was 
hospitalized and unable to move he talked about his dog so the 
nurses and doctors decided the dog could be brought to the 
hospital said philip persky a powars volunteer 
the dog came up to his room and jumped on his bed the 
gentleman sat up for the first time said persky its more 
than a bond its a healing process 
a trainer teaches volunteers obedience commands and suggests 
solutions when a pet exhibits behavior problems animals feeling 
stress because of their owners illness often relax once theyre 
put on a schedule kohn said 
the volunteers are screened to make sure theyre sensitive to 
the needs of animals and humans 
asking for help is having to share your animal said kohn 
we try to be as nonintrusive as we possibly can everybodys 
needs are different

decadeahead forecasts have the potential of 
landing far off the mark and generally they fulfill it remember 
those 1960 forecasts of the checkless society the cashless society 
everyone can cite special examples 
did anyone in 1970 foresee the incredible doubledigit inflation 
and 20 percent interest rates of course not and if seers in the 
early 1980s foresaw seven straight years of economic expansion 
nobody heard them shouting 
and the 1990s will there be a marshall plan for eastern 
bloc nations whose economies have been stymied by central planning 
will european economic integration succeed your guess is as good 
as the cias 
much of what can indeed be forecast is demographically based 
you can for example expect the number of americans over age 65 to 
grow rapidly and baby boomers to become middleaged that much is 
in the numbers 
it is clear also that recent immigrants will play an increasing 
role in business a reality borne out by statistics by the year 
2015 for example hispanics will comprise the largest minority 
segment of the population 
it is likely also that older people will continue to work if 
their companies let them because of health improvements and 
growing life spans and that many of them and younger workers too 
will work from home 
the latter is based on a continuation of existing trends which 
show both business and individuals utilizing technology 
computers copiers facsimiles telephone lines answering machines 
to transport data rather than people 
in 1988 according to link resources inc a market research 
firm 42 million americans began working at home for the first 
time up from 24 million in 1987 link foresees more than 30 
million in the 1990s 
arnold sanow a smallbusiness consultant believes many workers 
will have their own businesses he sees them providing work more 
efficiently for larger companies and even becoming capable of 
competing with them 
its not just young entrepreneurs working from home anymore 
says sanow president of business source based in the washington 
dc area even large corporations have innovative home work 
programs to fit employee needs 
believing the trend will continue american telephone amp 
telegraph co employs sanow as a spokesman for its tollfree 800 
business directory which has grown from 20000 listings in 1984 to 
more than 120000 in the latest edition 
as atampt sees it the growth of tollfree numbers also permits 
small businesses to operate nationally 
as callers it makes it easy for them to acquire information 
goods and services inexpensively from anywhere as owners of an 800 
listing it permits them to advertise widely and accept sales from 
any part of the country 
in spite of such forecasts and in fact the likelihood that they 
will be correct nobody can say for certain that working at home 
will continue to grow as anticipated some other development 
inconceivable now could thwart it 
but it is such demographically and actuarily based forecasts 
that seem most likely to come true if in 1989 there are a certain 
number of people aged 60 it can be fairly well predicted how many 
will be 70 in 1999 
combined with current trends such as the workathome movement 
and the development of technology that makes it more efficient to 
transport information than people such forecasts have at least a 
fair chance 
a better chance certainly than those economic forecasts about 
inflation and recession which carry guarantees that at best are 
good for a few months

once a week for three weeks aids patient 
robert pitman sat for four hours in a doctors office near his san 
francisco home receiving a drug smuggled from china 
that this treatment was not governmentsanctioned did not 
concern him nor did he have second thoughts when two others in the 
trial died for pitman the decision to participate in this 
renegade test of the drug known as compound q was a matter of his 
own life and death 
im a 48yearold man and if i dont do something i doubt 
that im going to see 50 that is not acceptable to me pitman 
said in an interview i may go down but im going to go down 
fighting 
pitman a playwright said he feels the government has failed 
him by not moving more quickly to get promising aids drugs to him 
and the tens of thousands of others with the disease or its early 
symptoms 
but he and other aids activists are not so quick these days to 
heap blame on the food and drug administration the government 
agency that decides whether new drugs are safe and effective enough 
to be marketed 
although people with aids remain frustrated by the weight of the 
fda bureaucracy theres a little more willingness to believe in 
their good will in light of several new drug approvals this year 
said mark harrington of the new yorkbased aids coalition to 
unleash power 
many however say it is the determination of aids patients like 
pitman that has pushed the fda to relax the rules and speed the 
process that still averages more than four years to grant approval 
to a drug 
pitman said treatments last june with compound q derived from 
the roots of chinese plants similar to cucumbers appear to have 
slowed progress of his disease and gave him more energy and an 
improved appetite but he said the benefits waned and he hopes to 
resume treatments soon 
martin delaney organizer of the underground study begun in may 
announced in september that test results indicated compound q had 
a significant effect and could be valuable in combination with 
other drugs 
an fdaapproved study of compound q is being conducted elsewhere 
in san francisco but pitman and others said it was running far 
behind the secret experiments 
if youre talking about a cure for dandruff id say ok 
pitman said but youre talking about a life expectancy of 16 
months it would have been a year from now before they 
researchers in the official trial found out what we found out in 
six weeks 
when the fda learned of the secret trials it did not crack its 
regulatory whip as might have happened before but took a more 
conciliatory approach the agency invited delaney to bring his data 
to washington and talk about conducting further trials under fda 
sanction 
delaney in a move reflecting the growing cooperation between 
aids activists and the government accepted the offer and agreed to 
stop the trials and retreatments of patients until new trials were 
approved 
you have to adjust the rules for the reality of the 
epidemic delaney has said where the fda has been slow is in 
changing the height of the hurdle accepting the need to make 
adjustments but i think we may be getting there 
the epidemic of aids is extraordinary and must be met with 
extraordinary measures thenfda commissioner frank young said 
earlier this year in announcing his agencys decision to expand 
availability of the antiaids drug dideoxyinosine known as ddi 
while still in the early stages of testing 
the fda says a study shows it has shaved more than three years 
off the average time it takes to move a lifesaving drug from 
initial tests to approval cutting the period to about 42 years 
paul coppinger deputy associate commissioner for planning and 
evaluation said most of the time saved comes from more efficient 
clinical trials and speedier delivery of test results to the fda 
last year the agency said desperately ill patients can import 
drugs approved in other countries but not here regulators also are 
helping move drug tests from university medical centers and 
government research laboratories into neighborhood clinics 
accessible to more patients 
in explaining the relaxation of some of the rules that had 
stretched the time needed to prove drugs safe and effective young 
spoke of the urgency facing aids patients these are people that 
have no alternative therapy so that medicine becoming available as 
early as possible really makes the difference between life and 
death 
throughout his illness pitman said he has researched all 
available therapies keeping up on the approved drugs looking for 
clinical trials of promising drugs and finding all he could about 
untested therapies 
im not advocating going off willynilly popping things in 
your mouth he said 
rather he is following his belief in individual responsibility 
using personal judgment rather than waiting for the government to 
act 
safe and effective is a meaningless phrase for me because im 
going to die of aids before they know what safe and effective is by 
their route he said

from the bluecollar housing projects 
of cockney east london to the gardens of the gentry grown men scan 
the skies for hours most weekends waiting for their pigeons to 
race home 
they rhapsodize about pigeon racing the sport known as the 
fancy and now one of britains more popular pastimes 
all you see is a pinprick in the sky said maj edward 
camilleri they fly toward you and you hope its yours then they 
fold their wings they drop out of the sky they literally do they 
come straight down like bullets 
says bernie bennett who has 60 pigeons unless youre a 
pigeon fancier you just find it very hard to understand to see a 
person out in the garden like me yesterday bucketing down with 
rain looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles 
with pigeons i find one thing and one thing only youre the 
jury youre the prosecution you are the judge all that happens 
down in your backyard is down to you 
camelleri a retired soldier who runs the royal pigeon racing 
association estimates britain has more than 200000 pigeon 
breeders and racers among its 56 million people 
nearly 2 million pigeons many with meticulously documented 
pedigrees dating back several avian generations are registered 
with camilleris association alone 
the sport has an honorable history the ancient egyptians kept 
pigeons hannibal took them over the alps they served in both 
world wars carrying messages for the allied intelligence forces in 
europe thirtyone pigeons were awarded the dickens medal the 
animal victoria cross in world war ii 
in britain pigeons were traditionally associated with 
beerdrinking clothcapped men but it has moved upmarket in 
recent years attracting lawyers actors and titans of industry at 
the top end of the scale queen elizabeth ii maintains a pigeon 
loft 
britains largest pigeon breeder louella pigeon world is a 
hightech enterprise that paid a world record 77000 pounds 
120120 in 1988 for the racing pigeon emerald ii 
that pound for pound makes it more valuable than the derby 
winner camilleri said referring to britains most prestigious 
horse race 
emerald ii is moved from one secret location to another because 
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money 
sabotage and pigeonnapping are not unheard of 
however high prices dont always guarantee success camilleri 
said and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds 32 
stockmanship comes into it knowing and understanding 
pigeons he explained they all have their individual 
characters and what youve got to do is understand their character 
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next 
pigeon 
no one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after 
being released sometimes hundreds of miles away 
the sun is definitely one factor and magnetic field is 
definitely a second camilleri said research in europe indicates 
the sense of smell also may help 
theres also a very basic urge 
most pigeons in britain are kept on the widowhood system as 
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young or squeakers 
theyre separated only the males are raced and the only time they 
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of 
a race 
each fanciers loft is registered and the distance between it 
and any of the 200 official british liberation sites measured 
to the nearest yard 
pigeons are bundled into baskets sometimes the night before a 
race and taken to the liberation site in airconditioned trucks 
each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its 
leg with the details of where it came from 
the pigeons are all released at the same time they ascend 
rapidly quickly become oriented and head for home 
when they land the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it 
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club 
the flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who 
won the race 
what is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty 
the fascination about it you get a few pigeons you start 
winning races and from then on its a lot like horse racing only 
cheaper camilleri said 
you can pit your wits against nature

three years ago a friend talked to constantin 
costagavras about a project concerning nazis permitted to emigrate 
to the united states after world war ii 
the director who makes films about issues greek political 
assassination in z chilean government brutality and american 
compliance in missing white extremists in betrayed was 
immediately interested he read books on the subject and developed 
the idea for his new film music box in which a lawyer 
jessica lange defends her hungarian father against accusations of 
atrocities committed during the war 
essentially i like to do something which has never been made 
or said before the greek director explained in a recent 
interview its the best way for me to do a movie to deal with a 
very original subject 
we in europe used to think most of the war criminals went to 
latin america when i was in chile they showed me places here 
here there where nazis lived paraguay also in america it 
was quite secret for the general population 
memories of the holocaust also haunt enemies a love story 
paul mazurskys new film the director started with isaac beshavis 
singers novel and filled in his own memories of growing up in the 
brownsville section of brooklyn during the 1940s 
ron silver stars as herman broder a polish jew who hid from the 
nazis during the war and now lives in brooklyn 
he is torn among his current wife yadwiga margaret sophie 
stein a polish peasant who took care of him while he hid from the 
nazis masha lena olin a fellow survivor with whom hes having a 
passionate affair and his first wife tamara angelica huston 
who has returned after supposedly being murdered by the nazis 
mazursky like singer and costagavras was never in the 
holocaust but enemies is simply a story based on secondhand 
knowledge and a firstrate imagination the director insisted 
isaac spoke to many survivors im sure who must have flooded 
the streets of new york said mazursky who also has directed 
harry and tonto an unmarried woman and down and out in 
beverly hills 
he probably got the story from talking to more than one 
survivor so that people like masha and her mother and herman and 
the person who hid him in the barn those are stories he probably 
heard and made this tale up 
i met many survivors had dinner conversations whatever all 
that i had gotten i gave to the actors while we rehearsed i had 
them meet with some of these people in los angeles and in new 
york 
for music box costagavras began with nonfiction and built 
a story around it 
in both films the holocaust is always present but never on 
screen unlike the recently released triumph of the spirit for 
mazursky and costagavras the subject seemed too large for even 
the most learned observer 
singer himself wrote from his hermans own experience with 
masha and other survivors of the german camps he knew that the 
whole truth would never be learned from those who had survived the 
concentration camps or the wandering through russia not because 
they lied but because it was impossible for them to tell it all 
so mazursky deferred to documentaries such as shoah and 
hotel terminus as more appropriate ways to learn directly about 
that tragedy once research was completed he concentrated on the 
actual film 
costagavras agreed saying he deliberately confined music 
box to the present 
you run the risk of being eaten by the story in music box 
theres no particular action no landscape its a very empty 
movie it takes place in the present but with people speaking 
about the past how you deal with the past thats the challenge 
with such explosive material it is important to have actors 
with whom the audience will be comfortable but balance is 
necessary the story always comes first as costagavras noted 
music box is not a jessica lange film any more than 
missing is a sissy spacek film or betrayed a debra 
winger film 
its not only being known its being a good actor he said 
youre a good actor and you get known thats the case with sissy 
or debra or jack lemmon and now jessica lange you can spoil the 
story with a big actor 
were far away from the actors of the 40s and the 50s gary 
cooper errol flynn this is over those kind of mythical stars 
now we go to see an actor playing a character a real character 
jessica made her character real 
mazursky praised silver acclaimed for his performance on stage 
in speedtheplow and said the actor was ideal for playing a 
herman 
a herman is somebody who comes from europe whose father was a 
rabbi whos a scholar an intellectual who loves women whos 
very bright ironic and whos sad the director explained 
ron can play that certain other actors a lot of them dont 
have all those qualities theyd have to find them im better off 
finding someone who already has them 
music box ends with lange shattered by what she has learned 
about her father embracing her son in back of their lakefront 
house with her own innocence gone forever she can only pass on 
her knowledge and help her son adjust 
the theme is about memory costagavras said of course 
the memory goes with the future she does what she does to save her 
son to have her son thinking differently and acting differently 
to learn how to live with this 
mazursky adds his own touch at the end of the film dissolving 
from a closeup of yadwigas baby to a shot of the coney island 
wonder wheel which can be viewed from hermans window the 
message is bittersweet wounds eventually heal a new generation is 
born but also the lessons of the holocaust may be forgotten 
out of the baby comes this image of the wheel mazursky 
said and all through the movie herman has focused on the wheel 
in his most contemplative and meditative moments when hes 
thinking about god knows what 
the wheel keeps turning life goes on the baby is life and 
life is mysterious theres man and theres woman it never ends 
even the holocaust is absorbed into that circle and the life will 
go on

think big has been much more than just a 
slogan in wall streets bull market of the 1980s 
big deals in big stocks have engendered many a big profit but 
there wasnt much left over for investors in many newer smaller 
companies known collectively in the financial world as secondary 
stocks 
so on the verge of the 90s while owners of blue chips are 
wondering whether the market can keep on rising fans of small 
stocks are asking a more plaintive question is their turn ever 
going to come 
historically investors who take a chance on smaller stocks have 
been rewarded with better returns on average than those who opted 
for the presumed safety and stability of householdname companies 
wright investors service a bridgeport conn investment 
management firm says that sine 1950 small stocks have averaged a 
total annual return capital gains plus dividends 25 percentage 
points higher than their bigger counterparts as represented by 
standard amp poors 500stock composite index 
when the market began its long advance in the late summer of 
1982 that pattern seemed to be holding socalled junior 
growth stocks in technology and other businesses scored some of 
the standout gains in the first year of the bull market 
but around june 1983 they abruptly stalled and have failed to 
catch up 
during the last 6 years investor indifference to smallcap 
stocks has been virtually unrelenting wright analysts observed 
in a recent report 
since mid1983 they noted the sampp 500 has been rolling up an 
annual return of better than 15 percent a year over the same span 
the value line composite index of nearly 1700 stocks which gives 
greater weight to a broad array of smaller issues has posted an 
average annual gain of 69 percent 
that showing failed even to match the 72 percent annual return 
produced by threemonth treasury bills which are considered about 
the safest most conservative paper investment available 
so investors effectively got paid nothing for taking the 
considerable risks that come with smaller stocks 
many reasons have been cited for this seeming anomaly including 
the predominant influence in the market of investing institutions 
and foreign investors both those groups have a notorious 
predilection for bigname stocks with large numbers of shares 
outstanding and high visibility in the marketplace 
at the same time individual investors who represent a primary 
constituency of the smaller companies have been shunning 
investments in individual stocks opting instead for mutual funds 
or other choices far removed from the stock market 
it is axiomatic on wall street that no trend lasts forever and 
this one has gone on for a long time small stocks are now priced 
at attractive levels compared to the major market averages 
wright says 
despite their subpar showing in recent years the firm 
maintains small companies still hold an edge over bigger ones in 
their growth potential since they start from a smaller base and 
often are run in a more youthful venturesome spirit 
if a bear market develops wright cautions it is quite 
conceivable that neither big nor small stocks will be spared but 
the firm concludes that highquality junior blue chips are in 
good position to beat rather than trail the bigname stocks over 
the next five years

it begins with a male actor recounting a 
romantic date dinner by candlelight conversation by the 
fireplace 
finally we kissed the actor says then he asked if i 
enjoyed safer sex i have never felt so good about saying yes 
the city unveiled the 30second television spot which ends with 
the line rubber up for safety with much fanfare last summer as 
part of its latest aids education campaign 
months later viewers of latenight programming on a local cable 
channel are about the only ones who have seen it 
to avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome the surgeon 
general recommended that people learn how the disease is 
transmitted and how it can be prevented through use of condoms 
the sloganeering has changed from safe sex to safer sex 
acknowledging that no sex practice including condoms offers 
foolproof protection against aids 
but getting the message to some of the people most at risk such 
as homosexual men or innercity youths without offending the 
masses is difficult at best say the people charged with creating 
the ads 
critics of explicit aids education campaigns warn they could 
backfire on health professionals and erode public support 
i think theyre turning people off said dr elizabeth m 
whelan president of the american council on science and health a 
consortium of more than 200 physicians and scientists active in 
consumer education 
reed v tuckson the public health commissioner in washington 
dc announced in 1987 that he wanted a sophisticated multimedia 
campaign similar to those that sell nike tennis shoes to poor 
black youths 
the department then argued with city officials and community 
groups for more than a year over wording on posters it negotiated 
with local news outlets and the public transit system which would 
not display placards with the word condom 
i did not anticipate significant opposition at so many 
different levels tuckson said 
reaction was negative in some boston quarters when a social 
service group action for boston community development unveiled 
its aids poster it shows four young men three with hats and one 
holding a condom over his head with the caption be cool wear 
your jimmy hat 
the group received complaints that by using the term jimmy 
hat slang for condom and also the title of a rap music hit 
the posters spoke specifically to young people and encouraged them 
to have sex 
people who are dying of aids and are in their 20s obviously 
contracted the disease while in their teens laura palmer an 
abcd spokeswoman said in reaction 
nevertheless the posters ready in march didnt make it onto 
city buses and subways until june held up by massachusetts bay 
transportation authority review 
new yorks rubber up for safety campaign includes two 
television spots the one so widely rejected and a second ad that 
features a talking head health commissioner stephen joseph two 
television stations including the local cbs affiliate have aired 
the joseph spot 
nancy davies vice president at capriello amp chabrowe the agency 
that designed the campaign said her people went back and forth 
with local tv stations on the more controversial ad changing it 
each time but the stations still said no 
they wouldnt have anything to do with them she said 
the citys newspapers have refused to run the campaigns print 
ads but they have shown up in subway cars and on station 
billboards one uses the headline mantoman with the letter 
o represented by a rolledup condom 
part of the goal davies said was to reach men who engage in 
sex with other men but do not consider themselves part of the gay 
community and thus do not frequent bars or organizations where they 
would see other aids education messages 
the bulk of the campaign when it comes right down to it is 
in the subway said davies 
whelan of the american council on science and health said she 
objected to advocating condom use not for moral or prudish 
reasons but because condoms are not 100 percent failsafe even when 
used correctly 
in addition she said the ads appear to condone at least 
unintentionally homosexuality or sex outside a monogamous 
relationship behavior that many people oppose 
if theyre meant for homosexual men i think they should be 
targeted at them and not at everybody else she said i think 
you end up turning people off and making them less sympathetic 
as head of the national aids information and education program 
at the centers for disease control in atlanta dr fred kroger is 
responsible for creating aids education materials for the public 
the first campaign in 1987 offered promotions on the use of 
condoms for sexually active people 
in general those were not played by anybody he said 
kroger said he had since refocused the message of the tv ads 
avoiding the word condom but including a telephone number 
people can call for information 
rather than putting lots of money into messages that would not 
be seen by anybody we opted to do less explicit messages he 
said 
public health officials and the ad agencies say they realize 
their work is controversial and they take pains not to be 
unnecessarily provocative 
but tuckson the district of columbia health commissioner says 
he feels they have a responsibility to get information on reducing 
the risk of aids to the people who need it 
this is a society that advertises feminine hygiene deodorant 
spray and depicts explicit sexual behavior in prime time he 
said what is offensive and insulting is not to give people 
information that can help save their lives

for 12 months police have doggedly sought the 
bombers of pan am flight 103 but said little officially about the 
progress of their international manhunt 
heres what they have confirmed and what news reports have said 
following the explosion and crash that killed all 259 people on the 
plane and 11 on the ground last dec 21 
one week after the disaster britains department of transport 
confirmed a bomb blew up the boeing 747 and said investigators had 
found evidence of a powerful plastic explosive 
in february scottish police said the bomb was planted in a 
toshiba radiocassette player and probably checked in as hold 
baggage in frankfurt west germany where flight 103 originated 
west german police had seized similar bombs in october 1988 and 
arrested 16 palestinians all but two were soon released including 
marwan khreesat who some people believe assembled the bomb in 
frankfurt 
news reports have frequently pointed to the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command a radical palestinian 
group based in syria as the leading suspect the groups leader 
ahmed jibril repeatedly has denied involvement but has also 
reportedly boasted he was paid by iran to avenge the downing of an 
iranian airliner by a us warship hafez dalkamoni one of 
jibrils top aides is one of the two suspects still held in west 
germany 
some news reports said the bomb was smuggled to malta checked 
onto an air malta flight to frankfurt and transferred to pan am 
without an accompanying passenger others say the bomb began its 
journey in larnaca cyprus in a suitcase switched with one 
belonging to us intelligence officers returning home after 
looking for american hostages in lebanon 
a court in uppsala sweden last month identified mohammed abu 
talb a member of the palestine popular struggle front another 
radical faction as a suspect in the flight 103 bombing scottish 
police were permitted to remove clothing from his sweden apartment 
reportedly to compare with shreds of clothing found in the 
wreckage abu talb is awaiting verdicts due dec 21 on charges of 
murder and attempted murder in connection with four bombings in 
northern europe court documents show he was in malta in october 
1988 
us rep james traficant jr of ohio released portions of a 
report said to have been prepared for pan ams insurance 
underwriters that alleges the terrorists got the bomb aboard the 
plane through a ciaprotected drug smuggling ring at frankfurt 
airport the cia called the allegations nonsense 
on friday scotlands chief law officer said an inquest would 
be held next year but said criminal proceedings were not imminent 
he said the inquiry would not be likely to hear foreign 
evidence but its scope would include whether reasonable 
precautions might have avoided the bombing and possible 
defects in any system that might have contributed to the deaths

if the 1990 wheat crop is already suffering 
can calls for federal drought aid be far behind probably not 
government officials say 
a weekly weather and crop bulletin by the departments of 
agriculture and commerce said winter wheat was in fair to good 
condition across the country although russian wheat aphids were at 
work in some areas 
the great plains remained dry the week of dec 410 the 
report said snow provided some needed moisture and reduced 
insect activity in the central and northern great plains 
but farmers in kansas and other plains states are looking at the 
possibility of drought for the third straight year winter wheat 
farmers particularly are concerned for the crop they planted this 
fall and will harvest next summer 
collectively farmers were paid 39 billion in federal aid for 
1988 drought losses and stand to get 897 million under 1989 
provisions as of nov 30 about 3197 million had been paid out 
for this years losses 
sen bob dole rkan was asked last month about the 
possibility of congress being asked again for disaster aid if 
winter wheat faltered because of drought 
i would guess if there is another disaster were going to 
respond dole said now it looks like if we dont get some 
moisture fairly soon its going to be a repeat performance 
dole acknowledged that many in congress including himself want 
farmers to start relying on federal crop insurance to take care of 
bad harvests but he said that wont happen until lawmakers improve 
the program 
every year we make these statements no more disaster aid 
its going to be crop insurance we havent reached that point 
yet said dole it may come up in the farm bill next year 
last week at the national press club agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter was asked about doles comments kansas 
historically is the no 1 wheat producer 
if drought conditions persist congress will inevitably look 
at drought aid that is as you can bank that as easily as death 
and taxes assuredly so yeutter said and its unfortunate 
that dry conditions do persist once again out in the winter wheat 
producing areas 
congress is in the midst of writing a new farm bill to replace 
the 1985 law that expires next year yeutter said the whole 
question of crop insurance and socalled ad hoc disaster 
assistance programs should be reviewed 
it was said that disaster aid for farmers in 1988 was hastened 
by it being a presidential election year but there were no 
national elections this year when a scaleddown relief measure was 
adopted 
although the number of farmers continues its longterm decline 
farmers and their organizations retain considerable clout on 
capitol hill whether that can translate into political advantage 
for one party or the other is open to question 
harry truman put it on the line with farmers july 15 1948 when 
he accepted his partys presidential nomination in philadelphia 
confidence and security have been brought to the people by the 
democratic party truman said farm income has increased from 
less than 25 billion in 1932 to more than 18 billion in 1947 
truman added never in the world were the farmers of any 
republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the 
farmers of the united states and if they dont do their duty by 
the democratic party they are the most ungrateful people in the 
world 
some time after his stunning win against the gops thomas dewey 
that fall truman noted that he lost four southern states to 
dixiecrats but carried 13 of the biggest urban states and seven 
major farm states missouri california iowa illinois texas 
minnesota and wisconsin

a 900 million recapitalization plan preserves 
shearson lehman hutton incs credit rating at a time of weak 
profits and layoffs at wall streets secondlargest brokerage 
the deal announced thursday also reduces parent american 
express cos stake to under 50 percent and excludes investor and 
revlon chairman ronald o perelman who was in talks for a minority 
share in exchange for a large investment 
moodys investors service inc confirmed shearsons senior debt 
ratings after the plan was disclosed removing a major threat to 
shearsons reputation and financial stability securities firms 
need good credit to borrow money for large transactions 
moodys said the recapitalization plan will materially 
increase shearsons tangible net worth 
continuing efforts to reduce expenses should help boost 
shearsons performance moodys said in a statement however 
intensifying competition in the global securities business and a 
difficult operating environment will remain constraints 
the recapitalization includes the issue of 20 million new shares 
of shearson common stock which would raise 295 million if sold at 
thursdays new york stock exchange closing price of 1475 a share 
american express which bought its shearson stake in 1981 would 
buy 3 million shares of the new issue pumping about 44 million 
into shearson the travel credit card and financial services 
company also plans to purchase shearson cumulative preferred stock 
with a liquidation value of 250 million 
in addition 300 million in capital would be raised through two 
equal stock placements with large institutional investors finally 
american express would buy ayco corp a shearson financial 
counseling subsidiary for 56 million bringing the total new 
capital to 901 million 
the institutional investors were not named but wall street 
sources said discussions were held to give a minority stake in 
shearson to perelman 
there were talks they were preliminary it really didnt come 
to terms one source said 
the sources who asked not to be named said american express 
had not finalized the outside investors but they said there would 
be a number of them 
the recapitalization is expected to shore up shearsons balance 
sheet but is not expected to guarantee a turnaround during a time 
of slumping profits and slow business on wall street 
the plan would achieve american express longdesired goal of 
reducing its stake in shearson to under 50 percent from 61 percent 
to remove the brokerages upanddown performance from its earnings 
report 
moodys on oct 30 said it was considering downgrading 
shearsons ratings on 48 billion in bonds and commercial paper 
because of the firms low capital weak profits and exposure in 
commercial real estate loans and investments as well as the 
overall securities industry slump 
shearson stock has fallen in recent months because of poor 
earnings the firm recently began laying off 800 workers to reduce 
its size to 35700 employees reshuffling its senior management and 
slashing stockbroker commissions for the first time in 15 years 
the boards of directors of american express and shearson 
approved the recapitalization plan late thursday 
under the plan american express will remain the largest 
shareholder in shearson nippon life insurance co of japan 
currently the secondlargest shareholder with 13 percent would 
remain in that position although its new stake would be smaller 
american express said it expects to record a onetime charge to 
net income reflecting the difference between the value of shearson 
on its books and the value of its holdings based on the share 
price the charge would total 60 million at thursdays share 
price american express said 
officials said shearson was willing to part with albanybased 
ayco which provides financial planning services to corporate 
executives because it fits more with american express operations 
american express said it planned to file registration statements 
with the securities and exchange commission early next week on the 
recapitalization

the house banking committee chairman says he 
will begin an effort to change the federal reserve board saying 
the splendid isolation of the central bank wont continue 
forever 
i recognize the need to give the federal reserve room to 
operate and make objective judgments said rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas a longtime critic of the fed 
but this doesnt have to mean it operates as some 
separate government free to veto economic policy spelled out by 
the administration the congress and the american people at the 
voting booths he said thursday 
on another matter gonzalez prodded president bush to 
reevaluate the administrations pollyannaish view that a 50 
billion savings and loan bailout is sufficient 
bush suggested earlier this week that the 50 billion the 
government is borrowing to close sampls through september 1991 may 
fall short however a day later his spokesman marlin fitzwater 
backtracked saying the president had no plans to ask congress for 
more money 
gonzalez in a speech to the consumer federation of america 
offered few specifics on how he would restructure the fed but 
afterward mentioned expanding the board to include representatives 
of interests other than banking consumers builders manufacturers 
and other groups hurt by high interest rates have long sought more 
influence over fed policy 
the seven fed board members in washington are appointed to 
14year terms by the president and once in office cannot be 
removed the boards of the 12 regional banks that comprise the 
federal reserve system are dominated by members chosen by bankers 
gonzalez through most of his 28year career in congress has 
been frequently critical of the central bank for fighting inflation 
at the expense of economic growth when interest rates soared in 
the early 1980s he introduced legislation to impeach paul volcker 
then fed chairman 
a bill introduced this year by reps lee hamilton dind and 
byron dorgan dnd would force the fed to announce the results 
of closeddoor sessions immediately rather than with the current 
sixweek lag it also would require it to meet regularly with 
administration officials 
however gonzalez said the approach was fragmentary and that 
he would launch a longterm effort to comprehensively restructure 
the fed starting with hearings and studies next year and 
legislation after that 
the splendid isolation of the federal reserve wont continue 
forever he said 
gonzalezs effort may get some sympathy with the bush 
administration which has complained periodically about the feds 
tightmoney policy housing secretary jack kemp has suggested that 
administration officials should have more influence over monetary 
policy 
however the chairman of the senate banking committee donald w 
riegle jr dmich and the panels senior republican jake garn 
of utah have said they would oppose any attempt to weaken the 
feds independence 
fed chairman alan greenspan has said the central banks 
independence serves the country well by giving it the ability to 
make unpopular decisions that benefit the economy in the long run 
gonzalez has maintained for nearly a year that more money was 
needed for savings and loans he invited bush to look very 
closely at the situation and to start running those computers 
overtime 
bad news may go down a lot better in january than next october 
with the crisis once again at five minutes to midnight he said

suppliers to department stores owned by 
financially distressed campeau corp are taking a cautious approach 
regarding future merchandise shipments 
one of the companies that act as middlemen between manufacturers 
and retailers known as factors said thursday it no longer would 
extend credit on goods bound for campeaus stores 
meanwhile several apparel and accessory manufacturers said they 
were keeping in close touch with executives in charge of campeaus 
us retailing operations bills have been paid on time so far 
they said 
the suppliers whose fates are tied to retailers expressed hope 
that business wouldnt be disrupted as campeau copes with a 
worsening cash shortage 
im very worried about the situation said howard bloom 
president and chief executive of chetta b inc a clothing maker 
it gets progressively worse looking every day im taking a 
waitandsee posture 
retail analysts said disclosures by campeaus federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp of deepening 
financial difficulties were unsurprising given the fierce 
competition in the industry 
federated and allied said in documents submitted to the 
securities and exchange commission that their cash could run out by 
march or sooner and that they might seek protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the move would permit campeauowned retailers to remain 
operating while their canadian parent company sorted out its 
financial problems at the heart of the trouble is the massive debt 
campeau acquired in taking over federated in 1988 for 67 billion 
and allied in 1986 for 34 billion 
a threatened inability to meet interest payments on junk bonds 
sold to pay for the acquisitions forced the torontobased retail 
and real estate company to turn to outsiders for help earlier this 
year 
canadas olympia amp york developments ltd came to the rescue 
with a 250 million loan to campeau as part of a deal for an 
additional 800 million next year from olympia amp york campeau put 
the bloomingdales department store chain up for sale in september 
about a half dozen bidders are evaluating the chain and campeau has 
said a final sale could be arranged by february 
in the sec filings made public wednesday federated and allied 
said bankruptcy court protection would be an alternative if lenders 
wont ease repayment terms federated owes creditors 115 billion 
by the end of april and allied faces debts of 6337 million due by 
the end of march 
failing a rescheduling of the payments campeau said it would 
consider selling additional holdings raising money by taking out 
mortgages on its stores or possibly seeking bankruptcycourt 
protection 
in addition to the 17store bloomingdales chain federated 
operates abraham amp straus burdines lazarus richs and

hiromasa ezoe whose recruit co gave its name to a 
scandal that brought down a government and tarnished the japanese 
establishment said in court today that he did not bribe 
politicians and public officials 
also denying bribery charges were toshiro ono an executive of 
recruit an information conglomerate and two politicians takao 
fujinami a former cabinet minister and katsuya ikeda of the 
opposition komeito clean government party 
if convicted the defendants could be sentenced to five years in 
prison 
their trial is the last of five which began nov 22 in tokyo 
district court and will last for months as the legal system delves 
into allegations of corruption in in the cozy relationship between 
japanese government and business 
the recruit scandal began in summer 1988 and brought down prime 
minister noboru takeshita who resigned last spring after 
acknowledging he received large donations from recruit 
other key figures in the governing liberal democratic party have 
been sidelined by the scandal and the honesty of ranking 
bureaucrats has been questioned because of gifts they accepted from 
recruit 
ezoe 53 told judge tadatsugu watanabe today he accepted the 
prosecutions allegations that he provided gifts and bargainpriced 
shares of stock to influential figures but he said they werent 
intended as bribes 
these events did occur but i do not agree with the substance 
of the charges ezoe said i had absolutely no intention of 
committing bribery i apologize for causing social disorder 
like the other three defendants ezoe accused prosecutors of 
mistreating him 
the prosecutors questioned me from morning to night when i 
tried to close my eyes they forced me to keep them open to the 
point that they hurt so bad that tears were flowing he said 
fujinami 56 was chief cabinet secretary under prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone takeshitas predecessor he is accused of 
receiving the equivalent of 140000 and 10000 shares in 
recruitcosmos a subsidiary whose stock was offered to influential 
people at a reduced price before it was sold publicly 
prosecutors say he put pressure on the labor ministry not to 
change the traditional season for recruiting college graduates 
which would have hurt recruits sales of jobplacement magazines 
fujinami denied the allegations 
fujinami said he had been unaware of both the political 
donations from recruit and the sharedealing which was done by an 
aide 
ikeda 52 is charged with receiving 14000 for himself 
35000 for his wife and 5000 shares in recruitcosmos for his 
brother 
according to prosecutors he gave prorecruit speeches in 
parliament in return ikeda resigned his seat fujinami remained in 
parliament but resigned from his party 
ono a 39yearold former company department head who faces two 
counts of giving bribes denied the allegation 
the other trials involve six bureaucrats and two other recruit 
executives 
prosecutors must show the point at which a gift becomes a bribe 
japanese law says bribery occurs when a public official or 
politician receives money or valuables from people or companies the 
official is in a position to supervise 
recruit offered millions of discount shares in recruitcosmos to 
hundreds of politicians bureaucrats and businessmen before the 
stock was available to the general public 
when it was offered on the overthecounter market the price of 
the stock shot up and the insiders made large profits fujinamis 
shares were said to have gained him 215000 
on wednesday the former chairman of nippon telegraph and 
telephone corp hisashi shinto 79 acknowledged he made about 
145000 in 1986 on recruitcosmos shares he bought before the 
issue went public but denied favoring recruit with special 
treatment when it entered the telecommunications market 
i accepted the offer of shares but i never regarded it as a 
bribe he said rejecting such an offer is considered rude in 
japan 
defense lawyers have argued such favors were normal between 
businesses and the powerful bureaucracy in japan where an entire 
industry has evolved around the custom of exchanging gifts to 
cement personal and business ties 
businessmen say such gifts are not aimed at winning specific 
favors but at establishing relationships with business associates 
supervising agencies and politicians that make it easier to do 
business with them

robert mckinney the former owner of the 
santa fe new mexican regained control of it thursday from gannett 
co inc less than one month after going to court to block 
gannetts attempt to sell the newspaper 
thursdays purchase by mckinney and his daughter robin mckinney 
martin ended a nearly 14year association mckinney had with 
arlington vabased gannett including a bitter nineyear legal 
battle over daytoday control of the newspaper mckinney sold the 
daily newspaper to gannett in 1976 
douglas h mccorkindale vice chairman and chief financial and 
administrative officer for gannett told a meeting of security 
analysts in new york city on thursday the transaction value was in 
the mid30 million range 
sheila gibbons gannetts public affairs director said the 
newspaper group decided to sell the new mexican because we felt 
this was a good idea i cant comment beyond that 
neither mckinney of santa fe and middleburg va nor martin of 
santa fe owner of the weekly taos news in northern new mexico 
returned telephone calls to the associated press seeking comment on 
the purchase 
mckinney in a questionandanswer piece scheduled to appear in 
fridays editions said his relationship with gannett has been 
long and stormy 
in the course of the current negotiations gannetts conduct 
has been proper in my opinion and i think that gannett would say 
that my conduct has been equally proper mckinney wrote i 
think however that both of us will now be happier going our own 
separate ways 
among the reasons for buying back the publication he added was 
i did not want to see the new mexican owned by or sold again to 
another chain operation 
gannett agreed in september to sell the new mexican to donrey 
media group of fort smith ark in a deal valued at 35 million 
according to court records filed in a lawsuit brought by mckinney 
to block the sale 
gannett said in court documents it terminated the agreement with 
donrey after mckinney filed a complaint alleging that gannett had 
violated an employment agreement with him 
the employment agreement under which mckinney remained the 
newspapers publisher for five years and editorinchief for 10 
years was part of the transaction in which mckinney sold the new 
mexican to gannett in february 1976 
mckinney alleged gannett failed to honor a stipulation that if 
gannett wanted to sell the paper it would have to give mckinney the 
opportunity to purchase it first by matching terms of the 
prospective buyers offer 
gannett in a counterclaim denied mckinneys accusations and 
alleged bad faith by mckinney to manipulate his right to refuse 
an agreement to sell the paper 
state district judge steve herrera said he signed a 
oneparagraph order thursday dismissing mckinneys complaint as 
well as a counterclaim filed by gannett at the request of both 
parties because the issues in the case had been settled 
the purchase of the new mexican which said it has a daily 
circulation of 20088 and a sunday circulation of 21189 involved 
the transfer of 800000 shares of gannett stock by mckinney and 
martin to gannett 
gannett said in a news release the shares were being transferred 
in a taxfree exchange for the stock of the new mexican 
mckinney who first bought the newspaper in 1949 was quoted in 
a new mexican story announcing the sale as saying department heads 
managers and staff members would continue in their present 
positions 
sale of the newspaper leaves gannett with 82 daily newspapers 
including usa today

affiliated publications inc publisher of the 
boston globe expects lower earnings from continuing operations 
this year but four other media companies indicated they will post 
profit increases 
gannett co inc dow jones amp co inc washington post co and 
mcclatchy newspapers inc each told securities analysts at 
painewebber incs annual media outlook conference thursday that 
their earnings will be up this year 
bostonbased affiliated stated that it expected earnings per 
share from continuing operations for 1989 will be 61 cents to 64 
cents down from 75 cents a share in 1988 
affiliated chairman william o taylor said he expects the 
company will do a little better next year as the decline in 
advertising volume levels off costs of newsprint remain low 
previous efforts to cut costs show results and the globe introduces 
more zoned editions 
douglas mccorkindale gannetts vice chairman and chief 
financial officer said analysts who were estimating earnings per 
share in the mid240 range are on the right track gannett 
based in arlington va earned 226 a share in 1988 
those results include a loss of a couple of million dollars 
at gannetts national newspaper usa today in contrast with a loss 
of about 25 million a year earlier according to usa today 
president thomas curley 
he said his aim was to make the newspaper profitable for all of 
1990 
the company which owns more than 80 daily newspapers as well as 
television ands radio stations and an outdoor advertising company 
declined to estimate 1990 earnings 
dow jones based in new york said it expects to report 1989 
earnings per share of 313 to 318 up from 235 a share in 1988 
the publisher of the wall street journal said that excluding 
nonrecurring gains its earnings will be off by about 4 percent to 
149 to 154 a share for the year from 165 a share a year 
earlier 
those results have been depressed by losses connected with the 
foreign exchange trading service operated by its telerate unit and 
retrenchments in the financial community that have led to sharp 
declines in financial advertising volume said chairman warren h 
phillips 
washington post which has properties that include its namesake 
flagship newspaper newsweek magazine television stations and 
cable tv operations said it expects its earnings per share will 
rise 20 percent to 1550 from 1290 on a pro forma basis in 1988 
it said its operating income will be up 33 percent 
richard d simmons president said 1990 should be a good year 
although the company could not hope to reach the same level of 
earnings growth as in 1989 
mcclatchy based in sacramento calif and publisher of the 
sacramento bee anchorage daily news tacoma news tribune and 
others expects to reach analysts earnings estimates of 115 a 
share to 120 a share this year up from 102 a share in 1988 
said james p smith vice president and treasurer 
smith declined to forecast 1990 earnings prospects other than to 
say they should produce good but not spectacular results 
but he noted 1990 results will be depressed by 20 cents a share 
due to the recent acquisitions of three daily and two weekly 
newspapers in south carolina and that mcclatchy expects to have a 
loss of 45 million to 5 million next year on its investment in 
the startup of a newspaper mill in washington state

us and french securities regulators will be 
exchanging more than pleasantries now that theyve signed a new 
mutual assistance agreement to investigate fraud and other market 
abuses 
under the agreement the sec and its french equivalent the 
commission des operations de bourse cob will assist each other 
by providing information in their respective files taking 
statements from individuals and obtaining documents 
both agencies also agreed in a separate document to consult 
each other about subjects of common interest in order to 
coordinate market oversight and resolve differences that may 
exist between the two countries regualtory system 
the agreement was signed thursday in paris by sec chairman 
richard c breeden and cob president jean saintgeours 
in prepared remarks for the signing released by the sec in 
washington breeden said the agreement provides a specific means 
for the united states and french regulators to exchange information 
for use in investigating securities laws violations 
the statement continued under the agreement the sec and cob 
will use their own securities enforcement powers to the greatest 
possible extent in providing mutual assistance this will help us 
to achieve greater stability and integrity in our markets 
us investors transactions in french corporate stock increased 
from 12 billion in 1985 to 4 billion last year during the same 
period french transactions in us corporate stock doubled from 
6 billion to 12 billion 
breeden noted that he reached a similar agreement monday with 
dutch securitiees regulators 
the statement added that the sec has undertaken several moves 
designed to stimulate international capital formation and 
crossborder activities of securities professionals 
they include a july regulation easing registration requirements 
for foreign brokerdealers to conduct some activities in this 
country and a new proposal rule 144a that would facilitate the 
sale of foreign securities in the private placement market without 
normal us registration procedures 
even as we eliminate barriers to international securities 
transactions we must be alert to the increased risks of 
crossborder fraud said breeden adding the agreement signed 
today strengthens our ability to prevent and detect these types of 
unlawful activities conducted across national borders 
the agreement allows either us or french securities officials 
to take statements and testimony from individuals in their own 
country and supply them to the other countrys officials 
information supplied to the foreign authorities is to be 
subject in most cases to the confidentiality rules of the 
supplying country 
unlike the dutch agreement the new pact does not confine 
applicability to french territory in europe 
the agreement however limits the exchange of information to 
events that occurred after the pact goes into effect

a 150 million federal lawsuit alleges 
apple computer employees saw pioneering xerox corp graphics 
programs at a trade show in 1981 and pirated the design to create 
the revolutionary macintosh computer 
the suit filed thursday in us district court also alleges 
thenapple president steven jobs saw a demonstration of another 
xerox program smalltalk at xeroxs palo alto research center in 
1979 and that he and other apple employees were very impressed 
with the unique and revolutionary userfriendly design 
jobs was ousted from apple in 1985 and founded next inc which 
makes workstation computers 
xerox never licensed apple to use the star computer program or 
its distinctive graphics or its unique design and appearance or its 
unique concept and feel the suit said it also claims apple 
gained unauthorized access by hiring several xerox employees in the 
late 1970s and early 1980s including star software developers 
the suit the first of its kind ever filed by xerox claims 
apples nowdefunct lisa computer system and macintosh finder both 
copyrighted in 1987 were derived from the two xerox programs 
smalltalk was developed in the mid1970s and star was copyrighted 
in 1981 
the lawsuit says apple employees saw the star program at the 
trade show in houston in june 1981 and copied substantial 
portions in its lisa and macintosh finder programs including the 
design and appearance of the main application windows dialogue 
boxes and menu and some of the exact icons or symbols used in 
the program 
apple was granted a license in june 1981 to participate with 
xerox in a project to implement smalltalk into a hardware system to 
be developed by apple the suit said 
thomas c abbott a spokesman for stamford connbased xerox 
said the civil suit was filed after efforts beginning a week ago to 
reach an agreement were rebuffed by apple 
we sought a settlement with apple and we resorted to these 
legal means only when it became absolutely necessary said abbott 
officials of apple based in cupertino said xeroxs software 
graphics concepts are not protected by copyright any more than 
depictions of birds and trees are protected by the copyright on a 
painting 
we believe the case is without merits said apple 
spokeswoman carleen levasseur the complaint confuses the 
difference between ideas and expression the copyright protects 
expresssion not ideas 
she said apple has always recognized xerox and others as 
responsible for ideas including computer graphics devices called 
mirrors and windows 
copyright covers artistic expression but not the ideas in 
art it does not cover the trees and birds in a picture only the 
picture what apple has done is take those ideas and spend a lot 
of money in research and development and make our own original 
expression 
the suit which asks for a jury trial said the star program 
is widely recognized in the computer industry as being the first 
to introduce fanciful desktop workstation graphics to allow the 
user to interact with the computer a development that took xerox 
millions of dollars and years of creative effort 
the suit claims a total of 50 million in damages from unfair 
competition under state and federal laws plus punitive damages 
under state law of an unspecified amount it also seeks at least 
100 million from apple for unjust enrichment from licenses and 
royalties for its products 
macintosh graphics replaced complicated word codes with simple 
symbols vastly streamlining the way users ranging from 
schoolchildren to office workers select programs issue commands 
and perform other functions 
in a similar suit apple sued microsoft and hewlettpackard co 
in the same court in march 1988 claiming infringement of lisa and 
the macintosh finder copyrights among others and alleging both 
were original to apple 
apple claimed that microsofts windows 203 and a 
hewlettpackard program called newwave which is based on it too 
closely resemble the look of screen displays on the macintosh 
a federal judge in july issued a tentative ruling that greatly 
narrowed apples suit by deciding the items covered in a 1985 
licensing agreement between apple and microsoft could not be used 
as evidence against microsofts and hewlettpackards versions of 
the products

as ual corp stock continues to tumble industry 
analysts are warning investors not to expect any buyout deal for 
the airline company to develop soon 
i suspect it probably will drag on for some time because its 
not an easy package to put together analyst robert joedicke of 
shearson lehman hutton inc said thursday one day after uals 
board announced it was still searching for a deal to boost the 
companys stock price 
investors registered their disappointment on wall street ual 
the parent of united airlines fell 550 to 16325 a share 
thursday on the new york stock exchange after dropping 8 on 
wednesday 
nonetheless airline industry analysts said they were intrigued 
by the boards statement that it would seek discussions with 
coniston partners an investment group that owns an 118 percent 
stake in the company and is pushing for a sale or restructuring 
some said the move could indicate a greater willingess by the 
board to listen to conistons ideas 
but other observers said ual directors may simply be trying to 
discern how much clout coniston really carries in its threat to 
solicit shareholder consents to overthrow uals board 
ual spokesman joe hopkins would not comment on when a meeting 
might be held 
paul tierney one of conistons general partners said it was 
impossible to interpret the boards intentions but he said 
coniston was concerned about uals slow progress in putting 
together a transaction to increase shareholder value 
the new yorkbased partnership says it will launch its consent 
solicitation if and when we conclude it would be advantageous 
airline analysts say coniston probably would have the support of 
other stock speculators who suffered steep losses on their ual 
holdings when a 675 billion buyout bid by uniteds pilots and ual 
management collapsed in october 
but conistons three general partners are believed to have 
little desire to actually take control of chicagobased ual as they 
have threatened since they would then face the same problems that 
are hampering the current boards efforts to put a deal together 
ual management has drafted a new employeebuyout plan that 
reportedly values the company at 240 a share or 543 billion 
but the proposal has not been endorsed by uniteds pilots or flight 
attendants and the powerful machinists union has said it would 
oppose such a deal 
if youre going to have a meaningful esop employee stock 
ownership plan you must must have the three unions involved 
joedicke said 
opposition from the machinists helped scuttle the 675 billion 
pilotmanagement bid in which british airways plc also was to have 
participated as an equity partner 
meanwhile the united chapter of the association of flight 
attendants opened a twoday meeting thursday in chicago to elect 
new officers 
local president patricia friend and vice president carol holmes 
announced earlier this month that they were stepping down a move 
expected to reduce friction between management and the flight 
attendants and perhaps smooth the way toward an employee buyout 
agreement

britains annual inflation rate rose to 77 
percent in november from 73 percent in october pushed up by 
higher mortgage rates the government said friday 
the underlying inflation rate excluding mortgage payments was 
unchanged at 61 percent the central statistical office said 
the financial markets had little reaction to the latest 
inflation rate which was better than had been expected 
economists had braced themselves for a rise to 79 percent after 
chancellor of the exchequer john major recently announced that more 
expensive home loans would push the retail price index up 
the government has pushed up interest rates sharply to fight 
inflation but the policy has the ironic effect of inflating the 
inflation rate 
major and prime minister margaret thatcher have said repeatedly 
that fighting inflation is their no 1 economic priority and that 
interest rates will stay high as long as is necessary 
prices rose 09 percent in november the statistical office 
said half the monthtomonth rise was the result of the mortgage 
rates it said 
the index which uses a january 1987 base of 100 stood at 1185 
in november 1175 in october and 1100 in november 1988 it said 
mortgage rates have climbed following the governments latest 1 
percentagepoint hike in base interest rates to 15 percent in 
october 
the statistical office said there was a sharp rise in food 
prices concentrated among seasonal foods in november partly 
because of poor crops caused by the dry summer there also were 
price increases in leisure goods and clothing it said 
but there was a small drop in gasoline prices and some price 
discounts for alcoholic beverages it said

investors have slowed their stampede from 
junkbond mutual funds in recent weeks as a revisionist school of 
thought on the risky investments has emerged 
it goes like this junk bond prices are so low that they can 
only go up and the generous yields on the bonds more than 
compensate for any risk that the bonds will default 
i think what weve probably attracted are some bottom 
fishers said neal litvack a spokesman for mutualfund operator 
fidelity investments a lot of people have felt that the 
correction has taken place the headlines are positive and theyre 
going to come in at a decent share price 
investors began pulling out of junk bond mutual funds in late 
summer apparently due to news reports of trouble at highly 
indebted junk bond issuers such as casino operator resorts 
international inc and department store owner campeau corp 
for example the junkbond fund run by t rowe price lost 28 
percent of its assets from sept 1 through nov 30 though some of 
that was due to a decline in the price of the bonds 
but price and other operators of major junk bond mutual funds 
say theyve seen a slowdown in outflows in recent weeks fidelitys 
fund even saw a net inflow of money two weeks ago 
there might be a contrarian undercurrent out there that given 
the very high yield it might be commensurate with the risks 
involved said brian mattes a spokesman for vanguard group 
another mutual fund operator 
junk bonds are issued by companies that have a poor credit 
rating or no rating at all they also are used to fund leveraged 
buyouts because of their risk of default they yield more than 
investmentgrade corporate bonds 
junk bonds are no place to put retirement savings at best they 
are suitable for surplus funds that an investor is willing to lose 
should the gamble falter many advisers say small investors should 
steer clear of them under any circumstance 
but recently as the prices of junk bonds have hit new lows 
some experts have proclaimed them a good investment despite the 
fact that some of the bonds may default 
dick swingle the manager of t rowe prices junkbond mutual 
fund said earlier this month that he considers the highyield 
market one of the most undervalued capital market sectors 
in our opinion todays negative environment for highyield 
bonds is a window of opportunity for the longterm investor he 
said 
mutual fund operators say junkbond funds react sharply to news 
reports about junk bond issuers and the highyield market in 
general litvack said fidelitys 145 billion junkbund fund is 
the most newssensitive hes seen 
what it tells you is that people are not terribly secure about 
that investment he said 
a recent new york times story headlined the new lure of junk 
bonds which described how some money managers see values in 
junk may have stimulated junk fund investments but headlines last 
week about campeaus assertion that it might have to place its 
department store divisions in bankruptcy reorganization had the 
opposite effect 
litvack said an investor in a junk fund that pulls his money 
based on news reports might be better off elsewhere this fund is 
not for people who are faint of heart 
junk fund operators say they take pains to warn potential 
investors of the risk 
but the risk has its reward vanguards 946 million junkbond 
fund yielded 1324 percent last week compared with 792 for its 
treasury fund a benchmark for safety 
however junk fund yields have varied wildly from year to year 
making a junk fund suitable for longterm investors only for 
example vanguards fund yielded only 265 percent in the year 
ended sept 30 1987 but in the year ended sept 30 1988 it 
yielded 1355 percent 
one year of negative returns can be fully expected with this 
type of fund mattes said

soybean futures prices rose moderately in early 
trading today on the chicago board of trade bolstered by 
coldweather concerns but grain futures were mixed 
frigid temperatures in the nations midsection have supported 
the soybean market all week amid perceptions that the cold has 
boosted demand for soybean meal as a highenergy livestock feed 
this mornings temperatures were among the lowest yet this 
season with subzero readings across nebraska kansas and much of 
the midwest 
the cold snap also supported the corn market but wheat prices 
were slightly lower amid profittaking after moderate gains in the 
past week 
the cold weather was expected to continue for at least another 
week but analysts said its influence would fade if new export 
business emerges 
its a market thats waiting for more russian business thats 
the best way to characterize it said gerald zusel manager of 
balfour maclaine corps floor operations at the board of trade 
in early trading wheat futures were 1 cent to 1 cents lower 
with the contract for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn 
was unchanged to cent higher with december at 235 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to cent higher with march at 155 a 
bushel soybeans were cent to 2 cents higher with january at 
585 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle futures were 10 cent to 22 cent higher with 
december at 7762 cents a pound feeder cattle were 13 cent lower 
to 40 cent higher with january at 8395 cents a pound live hogs 
were 12 cent lower to 33 cent higher with december at 5285 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 43 cent to 120 cents higher 
with february at 5075 cents a pound 
livestock futures ended mostly higher on thursday while pork

thea nations merchndise trade deficit soared 
to 102 billion in october the biggest imbalance in 10 months as 
imports climbed to a record level the government said today 
the commerce department said the october deficit was 198 
percent higher than the september imbalance of 851 billion 
the worsening trade balance reflected a big jump in imports 
which climbed 51 percent to an alltime high of 4121 billion 
us exports were also up by 11 percent rising to 3101 
billion the trade deficit is the difference between imports and 
exports 
a worsening in the trade deficit had been expected given the 
fact that imports normally shoot up in october as merchants restock 
shelves in preparation for christmas however the size of the 
increase caught many economists by surprise 
for the first 10 months of the year the us merchandise trade 
deficit is running at an annual rate of 1094 billion down a 
modest 77 percent from last years deficit of 11853 billion 
the overall october deficit of 1020 billion was the largest 
since a 1080 billion deficit in december 1988 although the 
august imbalance of 1010 billion was nearly as high 
in brighter economic news wholesale prices held down by a 
sharp drop in gasoline prices dipped 01 percent in november for 
the third decline in five months the government said today 
the drop in the labor departments producer price index which 
measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level 
brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the 
year down to 46 percent compared with 4 percent for all of 1988 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that despite the october rise in the trade deficit the deficit 
for january through october was 912 billion down 6 billion 
from the trade deficit for the first 10 months of 1988 
so its still moving in the right direction he said 
were doing exactly the right thing and now changes are necessary 
at this time 
on wholesale prices fitzwater said the decline for november was 
another example that inflation is low and under control 
meanwhile the federal reserve board said industrial production 
edged up 01 percent in november as the economy rebounded from the 
effects of the boeing aircraft strike and the san francisco 
bayarea earthquake that were largely responsible for a 06 percent 
drop a month earlier 
in another report the fed said the operating rate of the 
nations factories mines and utilities edged down 01 percentage 
point to 827 percent in november its lowest rate since april 1988 
many economists are looking for very little improvement in the 
trade imbalance in the coming year a forecast which would spell 
trouble for the us manufacturing sector already suffering job 
losses because of weakening sales 
the bush administration is likely to come under growing pressure 
in congress to erect trade barriers in an effort to stop the flood 
of imports into the country 
as usual the biggest deficit in october was recorded with 
japan an imbalance of 49 billion almost half of the total for 
the month as imports from japan hit a record level 
other large deficits included a 128 billion imbalance with 
taiwan an 843 million deficit with canada and a 783 million 
deficit with china 
the soviet union continued to be one of the few countries with 
which the united states enjoys a trade surplus with the october 
surplus totaling 1232 million 
the poor trade showing in october reflected import gains in a 
variety of areas 
americas foreign oil bill shot up 85 percent to 438 billion 
as the price per barrel rose 71 cents to 1709 while the number of 
barrels imported daily held basically steady at 826 million 
imports of agricultural products shot up 18 percent to 224 
billion while imports of industrial supplies were up 14 percent to 
117 billion

in a ruling favorable to the united 
states a world trade panel has ruled that european commission 
subsidies to soybean processors and producers impede trade a us 
official said friday 
the soybean case one of the main american disputes with the 
12nation european trade bloc had been portrayed as a test of 
whether ec agricultural subsidies generally violate international 
trade rules 
us trade representative carla hills said a panel set up under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt had ruled that 
the ec soybean subsidies violate gatt rules and impede trade 
the gatt panel was correct hills said we look forward to 
the ec correcting the problems that have been identified 
a gatt spokeswoman confirmed the panel had submitted a report on 
the dispute and said the parties had 10 days to react another gatt 
source confirmed the report which was not released publicly was 
favorable to the united states 
american soybean producers and exporters complained in 1987 that 
ec subsidies nullified or impaired concessions contained in a 1962 
trade agreement under that pact the ec allowed dutyfree imports 
of soybeans and other oilseeds in exchange for us tariff 
concessions 
the american soybean association has claimed that 15 billion 
in us exports have been affected by the ec subsidies policies 
ec officials were not immediately available for comment 
hills also criticized aspects of an ec proposal to reform 
agricultural trade under the latest round of gatt trade talks 
she said the ec proposal to rebalance its agricultural 
subsidies by reducing them on some products but increasing them on 
others would not prevent trade distortions and could reinforce 
them 
the us has proposed replacing agricultural subsidies with more 
visible and more easily removed tariffs that gradually could be 
reduced under gatt rules the ec has said it would accept some 
tariffs but oppose eliminating subsidies entirely 
hills is in brussels to participate in two days of talks led by 
secretary of state james baker the ec is the united states 
largest trade partner with 190 billion in twoway trade in 1988

eastman kodak co said today its 1989 
earnings would be reduced by about 500 million because of costs 
from a restructuring earlier this year 
the 500 million in net charges for the year translates to about 
850 million before taxes kodak spokesman henry kaska said 
the photography giant said 273 million of the reductions would 
be charged to fourthquarter earnings significantly more than had 
been anticipated kodak had already charged 227 million against 
earnings for the second quarter and had predicted that the 
fourthquarter charge would be lower 
kodak in august announced a major corporate restructuring that 
includes between 4500 and 5000 job cuts about 3 percent of its 
worldwide work foce wage freezes the sale or consolidation of 
many businesses and other costcutting measures 
this action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus if the 
kodak organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities 
that do not contribute to shareowner value kodak chairman and 
chief executive colby h chandler said in a statement 
chandler said annual earnings would be reduced because of 
provisions for writeoffs of equipment materials and inventories 
for various businesses additional charges will come from special 
payment to departing employees 
our business units and support organizations are clearly 
concentrating on valueadding operations and activities 
chandlers statement read as a result kodak will enter the new 
decade as a stronger more competitive company 
kodak earnings have declined in three straight quarters the 
rochesterbased company reported a 25 percent thirdquarter drop to 
329 million or 102 per share compared to 435 million or 
135 per share in the same 1988 quarter 
earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in 
the second quarter compared to yearago figures the apriljune 
quarter included expenses of the restructuring 
kodak has blamed its weakness in part on higher operating costs 
and no improvement in productivity deapite strong sales 
net earnings for the first three quarters were 589 million or 
182 a share down 46 percent from 109 billion or 335 a 
share in the first three quarters of 1988 the secondquarter 
earnings already reflected the 227 million in restructuring costs 
sales for the first nine months of the year rose 8 percent to

propelled by the strength of a single human 
hand it glides with ease its fit feels custommade and its one 
of the seasons hottest selling items behold the pen 
but not just any pen these are luxury pens the new musthave 
accessory for the rolexwatch set 
sales of fine writing instruments are skyrocketing this 
christmas with some retailers reporting increases of up to 70 
percent 
its incredible said bill wendell marketing manager for 
waterman pens we can sell every pen we make and well double 
sales this year 
unlike fad gifts of christmases past the pet rock the 
walkman giorgio perfume the pen is a timehonored piece 
after all puccini used a parker to write la boheme and it was 
a waterman that scripted the end of world war i with the signing of 
the treaty of versailles 
updated to the 90s the fancy pen is an affirmation of success 
the more aristocratic in design the better and the price it can 
be anywhere from three figures to four 
wendell calls the pen trend a cultural phenomenon sparked by 
the growing importance of highquality functional accessories 
some people say its a rebellion against computers said 
lisa sawyers manager of pen amp paper in nashville tenn people 
are tired of everything being faxed and computerized the art of 
letter writing is coming back again 
a fine pen is more than a nostalgic return to personal 
expression it is a status symbol said jeannette brewster a 
pen buyer for cole national corp which sells fine pens through 
its things remembered and hq gifts stores nationwide 
maybe the president of a company has one and when he goes 
to a business meeting everybody wants to have it she said 
among the growing menagerie of expensive pens cartier the 
master jeweler is offering its pasha fountain pen complete 
with 40 coats of lacquer and an 18karat gold nib or point for 
775 
then theres parker pens duofold a 300 pen drilled from a 
solid block of acrylic trimmed in 22karat gold and guaranteed not 
to explode under airplane pressure 
for those seeking something more contemporary theres the fendi 
pen from the italian designer of the same name which is encased 
in tiny rings of pale grey rubber and sells for a measly 35 
the years best seller may be the montblanc the product of an 
81yearold west german company topped with a signature white 
snowcap reminiscent of its namesake europes highest peak 
montblanc pens sell for 100 to 7000 each 
retailers say some of montblancs success comes from several 
years of advertising in magazines like architectural digest vanity 
fair and connoisseur now that americas appetite for pens has been 
whetted others are riding the wave 
waterman acquired by gillette co in 1987 is spending 5 
million a year to market its frenchmade writing instruments 
the best pens come in ball point though they are at the lower 
end of the spectrum rollerball pens use liquid instead of paste 
ink and therefore are more expensive the most prestigious is the 
fountain pen 
although the us is a ballpoint society people are finding 
the enjoyment of going back and writing with a fountain pen said 
richard mattes vice president of marketing for kohinoor 
rapidograph inc of new jersey the exclusive north american 
montblanc distributor 
fountain pens are the fastest growing category of writing 
instruments about 12 million were sold in 1987 a year later the 
number jumped to 21 million 
if youre going to write a love letter doesnt it look 
better with a fountain pen mattes asked 
because they require special care refilling the ink and 
occasional professional cleanings fountain pens have a very 
special cachet 
you have to have a bit more leisure time to deal with a 
fountain pen said watermans wendell isnt that the upscale 
imagery being projected by the user 
all pens must be chosen carefully but in the case of a fountain 
pen selecting a nib can take hours nib widths vary to produce 
fine to very broad scripts and the shape of ones penmanship 
depends on the pressure exterted on the nib and the angle it is 
held against the paper 
over time the nib conforms to an individual user and for that 
reason one should never lend it wendell said 
but despite a luxury pens ability to elegantly paint words how 
they write often is less important than how they look parkers 
marketing planner greg watts said one businesswoman told him i 
dont use this pen to write with i wear it

a sharp drop in gasoline costs helped push 
wholesale prices down in november for the third time in five 
months the government said friday in a report seen as giving the 
federal reserve leeway to lower interest rates 
the annual rate of inflation as measured by the labor 
departments producer price index was 46 percent for the first 11 
months of the year up from 4 percent for all of 1988 but much 
lower than was feared earlier this year 
the index dipped 01 percent last month following a 04 percent 
gain in october and a 09 percent spurt in september it declined 
05 percent in july and 04 percent in august 
the rollercoaster ride averages out to an annualized inflation 
rate of about 1 percent from june through november a marked 
contrast to the 9 percentplus rate for the first five months of 
the year 
if ever there was an example of inflation coming in like a 
lion and going out like a lamb it was this year said economist 
david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities 
dealer in new york that has to be good news for everyone 
particularly the consumer 
energy prices declined 33 percent last month the sharpest fall 
since august a 77 percent drop in gasoline prices more than 
compensated for a 01 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 07 
percent hike in heating oil prices 
analysts credit the taming of inflation to the federal reserves 
tight money policy pursued through this spring as evidence they 
cited a separate report by the fed on industrial production in 
november 
the operating rate at the nations factories mines and 
utilities eased 01 percentage point to 827 percent well below 
the 10year high of 843 percent at the start of the year the 
central bank said 
areas that were tight a year ago like chemicals paper and 
metals all have excess capacity when you have excess capacity you 
see price concessions said economist donald ratajczak of georgia 
state university 
since the summer the fed has reversed course on monetary 
policy hoping to avoid a recession by permitting interest rates to 
fall 
the latest price report gives the fed leeway to cut rates 
another notch as early as next week when monetary policy makers 
gather for the last of their eight annual meetings economists said 
a disappointing trade report for october adds impetus to the 
push according to the commerce department the merchandise trade 
gap soared 198 percent to 102 billion the highest level in 10 
months 
a drop in us interest rates could help the deficit by 
depressing the dollars value stimulating exports and discouraging 
imports 
the wholesale price report showed food costs rising a 
substantial 08 percent in november following a 14 percent jump 
in october the biggest in 22 months however they had declined 
overall from april through september 
pork prices jumped 71 percent following a 95 percent rise in 
october prices for turkeys and eggs also rose and dairy prices 
were up 33 percent the fifth consecutive increase exceeding 1 
percent 
because of the drought of 88 we slaughtered a lot of milk 
cows and were starting to see a milk shortage as a result 
ratajczak said its going to take a year to reverse that 
the increases were partly offset by a 151 percent drop in 
vegetable costs rebounding from an 189 percent rise a month 
earlier and a 65 percent decline in fresh fruit prices prices 
for fish chicken coffee and rice also fell 
the price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy rose a modest 
02 percent last month following a 01 percent gain in october 
increases for a variety of goods were partly offset by a 48 
percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 03 percent decrease 
in the passenger car index which had fallen 14 percent in october 
before adjusting for normal seasonal variations the wholesale 
price index stood at 1148 in november this meant that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost 11480 last month compared 
with 10980 a year earlier 
the inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the 
production process the price of intermediate goods fell 01 
percent in november after no change a month earlier crudegoods 
prices rose 04 percent after holding steady in october excluding 
food and energy crude goods prices dropped 23 percent 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods

wholesale prices held down by a sharp drop in 
gasoline prices dipped 01 percent in november for the third 
decline in five months the government said today 
the drop in the labor departments producer price index which 
measures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level 
brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of the 
year down to 46 percent compared with 4 percent for all of 1988 
wholesale inflation flared at a 94 percent annual rate through 
may but prices since then have barely budged the decline in 
november followed a 04 percent gain in october 
food costs which shot up 14 percent in october at the fastest 
pace in 22 months rose 08 percent last month however they 
declined overall from april through september 
pork prices jumped 71 percent following a 95 percent rise in 
october dairy prices were up 33 percent the fifth consecutive 
increase exceeding 1 percent prices for processed turkeys and eggs 
also rose 
however that was partly offset by a 151 percent drop in 
vegetable costs and a 65 percent decline in fresh fruit prices 
prices for fish chicken coffee and rice also fell 
energy prices declined 33 percent the sharpest fall since 
august a 77 percent drop in gasoline prices more than compensated 
for a 01 percent rise in natural gas costs and a 07 percent hike 
in heating oil prices 
the price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories a measure many analysts consider a better gauge of 
underlying inflationary pressures in the economy rose a modest 
02 percent last month follow a 01 percent gain in october 
modest increases for many kinds of consumer goods were partly 
offset by a 48 percent decline for soaps and detergents and a 03 
percent decrease in the passenger car index which had fallen 14 
percent in october 
before adjusting for normal seasonal variations the wholesale 
price index stood at 1148 in november this meant that a 
hypothetical marketbasket of goods cost 11480 last month up from 
10980 a year ago 
the inflation news was also favorable for earlier stages in the

percent in november after no change a month earlier 
crudegoods prices rose 04 percent after holding steady in 
october an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate goods and wheat for crude goods 
there has been a major deceleration in inflation in almost 
every measure that looks like it will stay in place in coming 
months given how weak the economy is said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co 
in advance of todays report many analysts were expecting a 
modest 02 percent rise in finished goods the actual 01 percent 
decline could give a boost to financial markets that are waiting 
for the next cut in interest rates by the federal reserve board 
inflation is finishing the year quietly largely because of the 
economic slowdown engineered months earlier by the fed analysts 
say 
the central bank nudged interest rates higher through most of 
1988 and into this spring reversing course as the first signs of 
sluggishness emerged this summer 
the bellwether rate charged among banks for overnight loans is 
averaging around 85 percent after peaking near 10 percent 
however the earlier tightening succeeded in slowing 
ratesensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and 
durablegoods manufacturing that curbed demand for basic 
commodities such as chemicals paper metal and rubber and held 
down the prices of those items

futures prices of grain and soybeans closed mixed 
friday on the chicago board of trade as preweekend profittaking 
offset buying related to the weather 
wheat futures finished moderately lower across the board and 
corn was narrowly mixed 
soybeans closed mostly lower although the contracts for 
nearterm delivery continued to find support in the bitter cold 
midwestern weather that has boosted domestic demand for soybean 
meal as a highenergy livestock feed 
the cold weather is expected to continue for at least another 
week but analysts said its influence will fade if new export 
business emerges 
the weathers market impact is more psychological than 
anything said gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps 
floor operations at the board of trade 
it isnt going to change the world supply and demand he 
said 
at the close of trading wheat futures prices were 1 cents to 
3 cents lower with the contract for delivery in december at 413 
a bushel corn futures were cent lower to 1 cent higher with

gillette co trying to rebuild profits hurt by 
recent takeover battles announced friday it would realign its 
operations and sell some of its european business affecting about 
750 workers in the process 
gillette said it was creating a north atlantic shaving and 
personal care group that would encompass its shaving products and 
toiletries segments 
the reorganization would make the company more efficient 
gillette said in a statement 
the move is part of gillettes strategy to improve its profits 
in recent years the firm has fended off takeover attempts by 
revlon group inc and coniston partners of new york but its 
earnings suffered as a result 
this fall gillette said it was introducing a new razor called 
sensor which would be priced higher than the current brands but 
also is designed to offer a closer shave 
both the new razor and the new corporate alignment are aimed at 
improving the companys profits said david fausch a gillette 
spokesman 
the companys strategy is to work to increase efficiency 
increase profits increase market share he said 
the merging of shaving and personal care will mean the 
elimination of about 250 jobs fausch said gillette employs about 
29000 people worldwide 
in addition the company will sell its antica erboristeria line 
of toiletries in italy la toja bath products in spain plus 
european hair care products those operations employ about 500 
people 
those products have not been as successful as the company had 
hoped fausch said 
the operations to be sold represented about 100 million in 
sales last year compared with about 1 billion in worldwide 
toiletry sales 
proceeds from the sales were expected to offset the costs from 
the realignment

as the number of days left until christmas 
dwindles into single digits catalog companies are out to persuade 
lastminute shoppers that they dont have to brave crowded malls 
and stores 
guarantees that gifts ordered as late as the week before 
christmas will arrive in time to be put under the tree are being 
touted by catalog companies eager to grab some of the 11thhour 
business 
many gift items can be had quickly flannel nightgowns from 
ll bean inc in freeport maine to filet mignons and elegant 
beef wellingtons from omaha steaks international 
the holiday shopping surge doesnt flow smoothly between 
thanksgiving and christmas it typically comes in two big waves at 
the beginning and the end with a long lull in between 
we are in the crucial final sprint right now said retail 
analyst monroe greenstein with the investment firm bear stearns amp 
co inc 
the second wave which can make or break the season has been 
a washout for some catalog companies in christmases past because 
customers wouldnt take the risk of being emptyhanded on the big 
day 
this year industry officials guess that possibly more than 150 
catalogs are bearing promises that federal express corp united 
parcel service inc or other rapid delivery services will speed 
presents on their way some that offered fast delivery in the past 
have introduced new extras 
sportswear and outdoor gear cataloger lands end inc based in 
dodgeville wis says anything it has in stock can be shipped via 
federal express to someones home within two days and the customer 
can designate the day a customer who works a standard monday 
through friday week might prefer saturday delivery for instance 
the cost is 6 per address regardless of the size of the order 
most catalogs boasting fast service require customers to pay a 
bit more starting at around 4 the charges which range as high 
as 1700 an order could turn off some potential shoppers but 
catalogers say theyve tried to keep them as low as possible to 
appeal to procrastinators willing to pay to be spared some 
aggravation 
spiegel inc which also owns eddie bauer and honeybee mailed 
reminders of its prechristmas ups delivery guarantee to hundreds 
of thousands of its five million active customers the guarantee is 
good for orders placed by dec 21 provided the item still is 
available it also publicized its holiday program by placing 
inserts in newspapers around the country and in vogue and gq 
magazines 
research done by the milwaukee brokerage blunt ellis amp loewi 
inc estimated last years total catalog sales at 12 billion 
about onethird of all american households bought goods through 
more than 900 catalogs blunt ellis says 
sales through catalogs which some analysts say have been 
growing at about twice the pace of store sales in recent years 
have expanded to meet the demands of twoincome families in which 
neither parent or spouse has much time to shop 
the direct marketing association inc says that this year 514 
percent of the adult us population has ordered at least once by 
telephone or mail up from 245 percent in 1983 the first year the 
figures were compiled 
robert longendyke spokesman for spiegel in chicago said 
express delivery services have made catalogs a more viable method 
of shopping for people in a hurry especially ahead of christmas 
before you had to be one of those prudent people that got down 
to it early he said the great thing now is you can 
procrastinate without having to go into the stores when theyre at 
their busiest

chrysler corp announced an 
incentive program friday designed in part to maintain production at 
its two minivan plants before shutting them down to retool for a 
new version 
the program includes a guarantee that the company will make up 
any difference in rebate programs through the first three quarters 
of next year a time chrysler has said will include some of the 
toughest months in recent automotive history 
the guarantee is aimed at consumers who may be waiting for more 
attractive incentives later in the year chrysler motors chairman 
ben bidwell said friday at a news conference 
we want some showroom traffic now bidwell said 
sales manager louis payne of keensport chryslerplymouth outside 
pittsburgh pa said his dealership could use some traffic 
its real slow this month he said friday at this time of 
year its hard to compete with santa claus 
typically vehicle sales pick up a little in january and fall 
off again in february before rebounding in march and april as 
weather improves 
in the past when one of the big three us automakers issued a 
new incentive program the other two soon followed general motors 
corp and ford motor co had no immediate reaction to chryslers 
move 
chryslers new incentives range from 500 to 2000 depending 
on model or lowinterest financing ranging from 69 percent to 99 
percent depending on length of loan some minivans have an option 
of cash rebates or interest rates as low as 39 percent on a 2year 
loan 
the program which expires jan 31 1990 covers twothirds of 
the cars and light trucks chrysler makes 
the incentives on chryslers minivans represent the first time 
in six years that an enticement has been offered on the popular 
vehicles since their introduction chrysler has commanded more 
than 50 percent of the minivan market 
but that share is being eroded by recent introductions of new 
minivans from gm and mazda motor corp and those already in 
showrooms from ford and a halfdozen or so japanese companies 
chrysler expects to introduce a new version of its dodge caravan 
and plymouth voyager next fall for the 1991 model year 
production at chryslers minivan plants in windsor ontario and 
st louis mo will be shut down in the third week of june and the 
third week of july respectively to change equipment for the new 
models 
the changeovers will take about four weeks bidwell said 
analysts have speculated that automakers faced with swelling 
inventories and waning demand may cut their supplies of unsold 
cars by curtailing production during the first quarter of 1990 
chrysler said this week that it would shut down its car plant 
near st louis causing about 3400 layoffs for four weeks 
beginning monday because of slow sales of the chrysler lebaron and 
the dodge daytona the company also said 3000 employees of its 
belvidere ill plant which makes five fullsize cars would be 
laid off for two weeks beginning jan 2 because of falling sales 
bidwell said that wont be the case for chryslers minivan 
plants which make a product thats responsible for much of the 
companys shrinking profits 
we absolutely do not face downtime except for the 
changeover bidwell said however he added some overtime at the 
two plants may be cut 
analysts and industry officials have agreed that demand for 
minivans will remain strong during next year while the industry as 
a whole weakens 
chrysler has forecast that 142 million cars and light trucks 
will be sold in 1990 down from the 148 million or so that will be 
sold this year ford has forecast a slightly slower year in 1990 
while gm has forecast the industry will sell 15 million vehicles

gaf corp lawyers alleged friday that government 
witnesses lied in testimony during the companys lengthy stock 
fraud trial and said gaf vice chairman james t sherwin rejected a 
lastminute offer that would have cleared him of criminal charges 
only hours after the government offered the deal wednesday a 
federal jury convicted sherwin and gaf on all eight counts of stock 
manipulation securities fraud and other charges in an alleged 1986 
scheme to boost union carbide corps stock price 
under the deal gaf would have pleaded guilty to all counts and 
sherwin would have been released of all charges in the deal 
according to lawyers involved in the case the company reportedly 
had approved the deal 
but as part of the deal sherwin would have had to sign a 
statement saying he was acting on behalf of the company in the 
unlawful activities alleged by the government 
lawyers for sherwin and gaf plan to appeal the verdict 
the gaf verdict which was viewed as a major victory for the 
government came after two mistrials earlier this year 
lead gaf attorney arthur liman in a statement said wats line 
telephone records from the jefferies amp co brokerage which 
allegedly conducted the manipulation for gaf refuted testimony 
that calls were made to sherwin to discuss the october 1986 scheme 
sherwin is a man of principle who sat through three trials 
that were tainted by brazen perjury that was finally exposed by the 
wats records liman said in a statement we were under no 
illusions as to the likely verdict it was visible on the jurors 
faces 
but the government insisted on a corporate allocution which 
would have stripped jim sherwin of all self respect and condoned 
the perjury this he could not let the corporation do and he has no 
regrets about the decision he made to allow the jury deliberations 
to proceed to verdict 
assistant us attorney carl h loewenson jr declined to 
comment on the perjury allegation 
the government based its case on testimony by admitted felon and 
former stockbroker boyd l jefferies who testified that he agreed 
to bid up the price of union carbide at sherwins request gaf was 
seeking to sell 5 million shares of union carbide after a failed 
takeover bid 
jefferies also said sherwin promised to reimburse the brokerage 
for any losses evidence included an allegedly phony invoice for 
40000 investment banking advisory services that represented a 
trading loss 
jefferies amp co chief trader james melton and trading assistant 
maureen oconnor testified about the alleged phone calls 
melton claimed he called sherwin at the end of three consecutive 
trading days to discuss the upward manipulation of carbide stock 
the wats line records indicated no such calls were made oconnor 
said she overheard the calls 
records for regular phone lines also did not indicate that the 
calls were made 
also jefferies testimony was contradicted during the second 
trial and liman in his closing arguments said jefferies testimony 
was filled with inconsistencies and contradictions 
sherwin faces up to 40 years in prison and up to 2 million in 
fines but his sentence is expected to be far less than the 
maximum gaf could be fined up to 4 million

media giant knightridder inc said friday it 
expects to post higher earnings this year and that savings from its 
recentlyenacted newspaper joint operating agreement in detroit 
will boost 1990 earnings 
tribune co meanwhile said it expects a profit increase for 
1989 but said earnings growth would be more difficult to achieve in 
1990 due to impending labor negotiations slow advertising revenue 
growth and weak newsprint prices 
new york times co said a gain on the sale of its cable 
operations would mean record 1989 earnings but earnings from 
continuing operations excluding the cable sale gain would be 
down substantially it expects higher earnings in 1990 excluding 
the cable sale gain 
the companies discussed their earnings prospects before 
securities analysts attending the annual painewebber media outlook 
conference 
advertising revenue growth from miamibased knightridders 29 
daily newspapers lower newsprint prices and lower interest costs 
were cited for contributing to the companys stronger 1989 earnings 
outlook 
james k batten chairman and chief executive declined to offer 
a specific projection of earnings 
but securities analysts have estimated 1989 earnings per share 
from continuing operations will amount to between 280 and 290 
compared with net income of 259 a share in 1988 and 1990 earnings 
per share from continuing operations of 340 to 350 
batten said one major contributor to earnings growth in 1990 
would be the recent enactment of the joint operating agreement 
between knightridders detroit free press and the detroit news 
owned by gannett co inc 
he said the agreement which combined business operations of the 
newspapers while news and editorial staffs operate separately 
means an end to 11 consecutive years of operating losses at the 
free press 
batten said the free press was expected to lose between 13 
million and 16 million in 1989 excluding corporate charges but 
that the company wont lose money in detroit next year 
batten said the end of losses at the detroit newspaper 
contiunued soft newsprint prices improvement at the miami herald 
and strong results from business information services will help 
1990 earnings 
chicagobased tribune co said strong growth in its broadcasting 
and entertainment businesses as well as increases from newspapers 
should help it post earnings per share of 310 in 1989 up from 
278 in 1988 
but scott smith senior vice president and chief financial 
officer although the company would like higher earnings per share 
in 1990 this may be a difficult goal to achieve 
he said the company faces difficult labor negotiations 
involving workers at the daily news in new york he said contract 
talks also will occur next year involving newsprint production 
workers in canada and major league players tribune co owns the 
chicago cubs baseball team 
smith said newspaper ad revenues were up 45 percent to 5 
percent in 1989 and should be slightly higher in 1990 but he said 
weakness in newsprint prices may persist hurting tribunes results 
from newsprint operations 
new york times co earned 208 a share in 1988 and posted a 
gain of 246 per share this year on the sale of its cable system 
it announced earlier this week it intended to charge 57 cents a 
share against fourthquarter earnings reflecting estimated costs 
of voluntary staff cuts at its flagship newspaper due to a weak 
advertising climate in new york further automation of production 
facilities and a decline in its valuations of its investment in 
forest products operations 
walter e mattson president and chief operating officer said a 
7 percent decline in ad linage at the times offset the effects of 
tighter cost controls that combined with lower newsprint prices in 
1989 will produce flat operating results from newspapers excluding 
special charges taken in 1988 
he said results from magazines would decline from 1988 showing 
a loss for the year due to acquisitions but that broadcast and 
information services were up and regional newspapers had a record 
year newsprint business results also are down sharply he said 
mattson said with the charges the company lost money in the 
fourth quarter and that earnings from continuing operations will 
be down substantially for the year including the cable gain 
however the company will have record earnings for the year 
he said he agreed with analysts who have predicted another 
year of low earnings in 1990 but said earnings should top 1989 
results excluding the cable sale

general motors corp will buy half of saabscania 
abs troubled car business for about 600 million in a deal 
analysts described friday as a good one for both companies 
the analysts endorsement of the association is far different 
from the concern some voiced seven weeks ago when ford motor co 
announced it would buy all of british automaker jaguar plc for 25 
billion 
gm paid about 3000 per unit and jaguar went for about 
40000 per unit said analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp 
co referring to the ratio of investment price and the sales of 
saab and jaguar cars 
one way to look at the 600 million is thats how much it 
takes to build a new car he said 
gm and saab will form a new independent swedish car company 
called saab automobile ab which will produce cars under the saab 
name for worldwide distribution and some gm models for the european 
market 
in sweden saabscania president georg karnsund said in a 
statement that times are tough for lowvolume automakers saabs 
car operations lost 1861 million during the first eight months of 
this year 
soaring costs for research and development and everincreasing 
international competition make it difficult for smallvolume makers 
to survive on their own in a longer perspective he said 
for gm said analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody inc in 
new york i think there are some definite benefits they get 
greater access to the scandinavian market and the european market 
in general 
the days of the smaller nicheoriented companies are getting 
fewer and farther between he said 
under their agreement gm and saab will invest 100 million in 
the new venture each company will nominate five members of the 
10member board and gm will nominate the chairman 
the company will manufacture and distribute cars under the saab 
name for sale through saabs independent dealer network and produce 
gm cars for sale through gms europe organization gm said in a 
statement 
saab products are considered a premium brand they have a good 
image for high technology and performance said gm spokesman jack 
harned in detroit 
also under the agreement saab will form a new saabscania 
automotive electronics ab in which gm will have a minority share 
to research develop and manufacture advanced auto electronics 
systems 
saabscanias karnsund also said an agreement had been reached 
between saab missile and gm hughes aircraft co a gm subsidiary

a letter of intent for coors brewing co to buy 
stroh brewing cos domestic beer making operations for 425 
million expired friday with no sale freeing stroh to seek other 
buyers the companies said 
chris sortwell stroh vice president for corporate planning and 
development said the companies agreed not to discuss details such 
as whether the price or antitrust considerations were stumbling 
blocks to the buyout 
but coors president peter coors cited unresolved issues in the 
transaction as originally contemplated and concern with antitrust 
issues 
we felt it best for both parties to take a fresh look at 
things and explore other alternatives he said 
stroh chairman peter stroh said his company expects to continue 
discussions with coors although on terms different from those in 
the letter of intent stroh brewing also will consider discussions 
with others he said 
apparently they have opened up the negotiations to anyone 
said allan kaplan beverage analyst with merrill lynch amp co in new 
york it does sound like the deal is off i think they must have 
disagreed on price 
stroh officials wouldnt discuss whether others have made 
overtures sortwell said 
stroh has argued that combining with coors would increase 
competition by creating an effective no 3 competitor to go against 
anheuserbusch cos the leader with 41 percent of the market and 
no 2 miller brewing co which has 21 percent 
stroh now is no 3 with an 11 percent market share and coors is 
no 4 with just under 8 percent followed by g heileman amp co with 
about 7 percent 
although we continue to believe that consolidation in the 
brewing industry would be good for longterm competition we are 
taking aggressive steps to strengthen our ability to compete 
independently stroh said 
preparations for possible independent operation included recent 
employment cuts and sales of stroh assets sortwell said as of 
right now it would appear to be somewhat likely he said 
on thursday the 139yearold detroit company said it had agreed 
to sell its sundance natural juice sparkler business for 58 
million to a partnership in which stroh and guinness plc each would 
hold a 44 percent interest 
stroh has sought potential partners since february and announced 
aug 31 it was laying off 300 of its 1500 whitecollar employees 
nationwide because there had been no suitable offers 
members of wisconsins congressional delegation asked the us 
justice department in november to prohibit the coorsstroh 
transaction as anticompetitive the departments antitrust 
division was reviewing the deal 
also pending is a federal lawsuit by sampp co a mill valley 
calif company that owns several smaller breweries including 
pabst blue ribbon hamms olympia and falstaff and commands a 4 
percent market share the suit contends the combination would 
overwhelmingly increase the market share of the nations four 
largest brewers

a regional real estate slump prompted bank of new 
england corp to announce friday it will sharply boost reserves 
against bad loans and that it expects a substantial loss for the 
year 
the bank also announced it had reassigned a senior executive 
overseeing its real estate group that it was considering the sale 
and merger of some operations and that it may rescind its common 
stock dividend declared nov 27 
in my history of following bank stocks that action is 
unprecedented said james moynihan senior vice president of 
advest inc in boston referring to the stock move i think what 
it tells you is the deterioration of the real estate market is 
getting faster it goes from bad to worse every day 
it may be in the best interest of the company to preserve its 
capital even at the expense of shareholders he said 
marcia ryan a spokeswoman for the bank said a dividend of 34 
cents a share had been declared for the fourth quarter ending dec 
31 what were saying is were looking at a very large addition 
to our reserves and that is going to change the dividend 
calculations she said 
bank of new england which had a loan loss reserve of 354 
million at the end of the third quarter said it would boost that 
total to more than 1 billion in the current quarter 
the company already had taken provisions for problem loans 
totaling about 2073 million in the nine months ended sept 30 
bank of new england stock tumbled 337 to 9 a share in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading friday 
the company owner of the regions secondlargest bank 
indicated in late november that it expected a substantial loss for 
the fourth quarter due to the sluggish area economy and a soft real 
estate market at that time bank of new england announced the sale 
of a major portion of its leasing operations to the bank of tokyo 
as part of a strategic restructuring 
the latest move follows similar steps taken by other financial 
institutions 
bank of boston the largest bank in new england reported a 125 
million loss in its third quarter after setting aside money to 
cover problem loans 
much of the trouble stems from the regions real estate market 
which boomed during the middle 1980s but now has gone sour as a 
result banks have found many developers are having trouble making 
loan payments 
bank of new england chairman walter j connolly jr issued a 
statement saying the additional money placed in reserves was 
appropriate to the quality of the banks loan portfolio and 
existing economic conditions in new england 
nonperforming assets are expected to increase to 16 billion 
but the company said it projects its capital ratios will exceed 
regulatory minimums 
connolly also said the banks senior management along with a 
special committee of the board of directors was addressing the 
companys loans and assets 
executive vice president james sweeney who had been head of the 
real estate group has been removed from that position and assigned 
to other duties in the company 
the finger has to point at someone moynihan said these 
problems are real estate related some changes had to be made 
the bank announced that executive vice president hugh taylor 
head of the corporate banking group will take over the real estate 
division until a permanent head is selected 
bank of new england also announced the special committee and 
management will look at steps to increase shareholder values 
including possible mergers and sales of assets 
the company posted a profit of 1216 million in the nine months 
ended sept 30 down from 2077 million in the same period a year 
earlier

on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
no 2 heating oil jumped 314 cents to 7042 cents a gallon in 
active trading domestic heating oil last closed higher on jan 10

wholesale unleaded gasoline for january ended the session at 
5280 cents a gallon a gain of 119 cents on the session and 065 
cent for the week 
subfreezing temperatures throughout much of the nation have

europe due to the low water level of the rhine river also 
contributed to the demand spurt 
the river rhine rose a foot this week but the situation still 
had a moderating impact on us markets this week said peter 
beutel energy analyst with elders futures inc 
meanwhile manuel antonio noriegas rubberstamp legislature 
friday named him chief executive of panama and gave him sweeping 
powers to confront us efforts to oust the combative general

eastman kodak co said friday that costs 
related to a restructuring announced this year would reduce fourth 
quarter earnings by 273 million significantly more than the 
company had predicted 
the 273 million charge brings kodaks total 1989 restructuring 
costs to 500 million or 850 million before taxes spokesman 
henry kaska said the photography giant had charged 227 million 
against its second quarter earnings 
kodak had estimated earlier this year that fourth quarter 
charges would be lower than those in the second quarter 
charges have evolved as plans have finalized kaska said 
its the difference between predictions and actual experience 
kodak has now accounted for all charges associated with the 
restructuring kaska said 
charges in 1990 should be only those that occur in the normal 
course of our ongoing operations he said 
kodak announced a restructuring plan in august designed to save 
the company 1 billion in costs and turn around its sagging 
profits the plan includes selling or reorganizing about 20 
businesses and cutting more than 4500 jobs about 3 percent of 
kodaks worldwide workforce as well as freezing wages and other 
costcutting measures 
this action reflects our efforts to sharpen the focus of the 
kodak organization by withdrawing from businesses and activities 
that do not contribute to shareowner value chairman and chief 
executive officer colby h chandler said 
our business units and support organizations are clearly 
concentrating on valueadding operations and activities he said 
as a result kodak will enter the new decade as a stronger more 
competitive company 
kodak earnings have declined in three straight quarters the 
rochesterbased company has blamed its poor showing on higher 
operating costs and no improvement in productivity as well as 
competition from abroad 
earnings dropped 25 percent in the third quarter to 329 
million or 102 a share vs 435 million or 135 per share in 
the same 1988 quarter 
earnings fell 23 percent in the first quarter and 85 percent in 
the second quarter when the first restructuring charges were 
recognized net earnings for the first three quarters were 589 
million or 182 a share down 46 percent from 109 billion or 
335 per share in the first three quarters of 1988 
mark obenzinger a stock analyst at trinity trading co in new 
york predicted that kodak would do no better than break even in 
the fourth quarter of 1989 
earnings in 1990 will improve simply because there will be no 
more charges he said but kodak will face a number of challenges 
to improving profits in the first half of the year 
among those challenges is the expected ruling on how much kodak 
will have to pay polaroid for violating its instant camera patent 
predicted to be in the 1 billion to 2 billion range the company 
also faces fierce foreign competition and a weak economy 
obenzinger said 
as you go into the first quarter of 1990 its going to be a 
fairly interesting time he said this addresses the ills of 
the past but does not guarantee them the future 
kaska said slightly more than a third of the 500 million charge 
reflects inventory writeoffs from the businesses kodak is exiting 
other costs include writeoffs of equipment and goodwill costs 
the amount a company pays for an asset in excess of its value and 
benefits paid to departing employees he said 
kodak has so far announced the sale of 10 businesses and kaska 
said the company hopes to have the sale of at least 10 more 
completed in the next two weeks

two former executives of a united 
technologies corp division pleaded guilty friday to obtaining 
inside information from a navy official about a defense contract 
competition 
james e rapinac 54 a former senior vice president of the 
norden systems division and c j jack richardson 48 a 
former norden marketing executive pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
defraud the government 
they agreed to cooperate with the longrunning investigation of 
procurement fraud and influence peddling nicknamed operation ill 
wind that has netted convictions of 29 individuals and four 
corporations 
while i offer no excuses for my actions i do believe the 
defense acquisition process is conducive to abuses rapinac said 
rapinac and richardson each could face up to five years in 
prison and fines up to 250000 when us district judge claude m 
hilton sentences them march 9 
they admitted paying 27500 to washington defense consultant 
thomas e muldoon for inside information on the award of a marine 
corps contract to build a radar command and control system worth up 
to 150 million 
with the help of another defense consultant mark saunders 
muldoon obtained information about the confidential selection 
process being conducted by the space and naval warfare systems 
command according to court papers filed by the prosecution friday 
saunders got the information from george stone then a senior 
procurement official at the naval command and gave it to muldoon 
to be relayed to rapinac and richardson according to the statement 
of facts filed by prosecutors in the case 
muldoon provided information about how various navy procurement 
boards ranked the proposals of competing defense companies and told 
rapinac and richardson what other companies were bidding advising 
norden to lower its bid to 95 million prosecutors said 
neither stone nor saunders has been charged 
muldoon 59 was convicted thursday for participating in a 
scheme by a whittaker corp subsidiary to funnel bribes to a marine 
corps contracting official he faces a possible 70year prison 
sentence on that conviction 
prosecutors describe muldoon as a major figure in the pentagon 
procurement scandal 
norden abruptly withdrew from the competition in june 1988 
when the ill wind investigation became public prosecutors said 
in a letter to employees united technologies chairman robert f 
daniell said the actions of the former norden executives were 
wrong and violated clear company policies 
this unfortunate occurrence compels me to remind all employees 
we are committed to upholding the law and maintaining the highest 
standards of ethical conduct daniell said 
company spokesman dan harrison said united technologies is 
cooperating with the investigation 
court papers said that nordens president edward decker 
approved the consulting agreement with muldoon but harrison said 
that approval of all consulting agreements by the president was 
standard procedure and decker did not authorize illegally 
obtaining government information 
stones attorney brian gettings called the allegations against 
his client a lot of hearsay 
also friday hilton sentenced two former executives of a 
whittaker corp subsidiary for participating in a scheme to bribe a 
marine corps procurement officer both pleaded guilty to bribery 
charges 
scott m lamberth 59 a former vice president of whittaker 
command and control systems received a 10month sentence 10000 
fine for his involvement in a scheme to funnel more than 80000 to 
the procurement official 
john franklin van tassel 53 who headed the companys 
fayetteville ark operation was ordered to serve three months in 
a halfway house and fined 3000 
the bribes were funneled to jack a sherman through muldoon and 
two other defense consultants sherman is serving an 18month 
prison term for participating in another bribery scheme

gold and other precious metals which is typical during periods of 
heightened international tensions

trend and susceptible to bullish moves on any news of this nature 
that comes out said anne orton a vice president of deak 
international inc a new yorkbased dealer of precious metals and 
currencies 
the gold runup also was a response to a sharp drop in stock 
prices in the middle of the afternoon reminding observers that a

golds recent surge from levels near 360 an ounce

for more than a week but analysts said the markets pronounced 
behavior on friday indicated underlying bullishness

bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc the 
dollars weak and i think that will be a longterm bullish backdrop 
for gold

renee mottram a spokeswoman for dwg said that posner still 
plans to move arbys headquarters to miami beach by 1991 
the franchisee group headed by former arbys president leonard 
h roberts sought to buy arbys a move resisted by posner 
the group charged that a variety of legal and financial problems 
faced by posner was threatening the stability of the chain which 
specializes in roast beef sandwiches 
roberts said friday that belattis appointment signaled an 
apparent end to the friction within the company 
roberts said he was stepping down as president of ap 
association an organization of franchisees representing about 75 
percent of the chains 2150 restaurants 
but he took a parting shot at posner 
i hope the stability achieved this week by the arbys system 
is permanent roberts said but i urge you to be mindful of 
what has happened to other companies that posner has controlled 
and if instability returns i urge you to recall the values of 
unity and mobilization they do get results he said 
roberts who was popular with the chains franchisees was 
ousted from arbys in september after he clashed with posner over 
the 200 million takeover bid the two had been in a verbal war 
ever since with posner at one point accusing roberts of waging a 
misinformation campaign with ugly press releases 
posner acquired arbys in 1984 as part of chesapeake financial 
corps 400 purchase of royal crown companies inc posners dwg 
owns 60 percent of chesapeake

winnebago industries inc ended its 
experiment in management by committee on friday naming richard 
conner president and chief executive of the company that makes 
recreational vehicles and trucks and offers satellite delivery of 
television commercials 
winnebago which is trying to recover from a series of losses 
also announced other executive appointments replacing the 
10person management council that had governed the forest city 
company since september 1988 
conner said his task would be downsizing winnebago to make 
it more efficient so it could better ride out swings in gasoline 
prices and the economy two major factors that influence sales of 
motor homes 
he said no layoffs are planned but that the company might reduce 
its payroll by not filling all vacancies created by workers leaving 
or retiring 
efficiencies mostly would come by being more careful with 
inventories and getting rid of excess raw material 
weve got a lot of work to do he said in a telephone 
interview 
the appointments were announced by john k hanson winnebagos 
founder and chairman a day after a vote on the changes by the 
companys board of directors 
the announcement also followed by a day the companys report of 
a 46 million loss and a 38 percent slide in revenue in the first 
quarter of its fiscal year compared with the same period a year 
earlier the loss followed a fourthquarter sea of red ink an 
113 million loss that was the largest of any quarter in the 
companys history 
conner said that in addition to strengthening the management 
team and moving to control expenses winnebago also will try to 
turn things around by doing a better job designing and selling its 
products 
the company is financially strong because of its low debt but 
conner said the strongest thing is the reputation and name 
winnebago seems to stand for quality and were going to live up to 
that 
conner 57 has been a member of the companys board since 1985 
and was chief executive of winnebagos cycle sat subsidiary since 
august cycle sat delivers commercials to television stations by 
satellites 
the election of conner as president was no surprise he was 
marked for advancement in august when he was elected deputy 
chairman of the board to replace john v hanson the founders son 
who resigned as a director and officer of the company 
i understand he conner gets along with john k hanson which 
is a necessary in the job said frank rolfes an analyst who 
follows winnebago for the minneapolis securities firm of dain 
bosworth 
rolfes said the appointment would help improve winnebagos image 
because i dont think anybody likes to see a company run by a 
committee 
winnebago stock closed down 25 cents at 525 a share in trading 
friday on the new york stock exchange the announcement of the new 
management team came at the end of the trading day

group in san francisco

moving she said the market is very quiet there arent that 
many positions in the street now 
bondholders have welcomed recent news of a slowing economy 
because it implies less demand for goods and services easing the 
risk of inflation which erodes the value of bonds

that would lower interest rates to stimulate the economy lower 
rates make fixedincome investments such as bonds more valuable 
economists said they believe the fed could ease interest rates

debtridden circle k corp on friday reported 
that it has arranged shortterm debt relief in an attempt to get 
ahead of its interest payments 
company spokesman ray cox said the new agreement was made 
possible when a syndicate of banks waived compliance with the 
requiredprofitlevel covenants covering circle ks 325 million 
credit agreement the company has drawn on 260 million cox said 
in addition circle k received a 60 million 100day extension 
of credit he said 
cox also announced a 499 million loss amounting to 16 cents 
per share for the second quarter of its 1990 fiscal year 
in the aug 1oct 31 period circle k had revenues of 9372 
million cox said 
last year the company reported a 1330 million profit or 25 
cents per fully diluted share on sales of 85167 million 
part of the loss stemmed from a 22 million charge in the 
companys failed attempts to find a buyer for itself circle k 
began the effort in may and abandoned it several months ago after 
chairman karl eller decided not to bid on a buyout 
cox added that the operating results also included an aftertax 
loss of just over 1 million for its 50 percent share of a joint 
venture in the united kingdom 
coxs secretary said he was unavailable for comment on the 
status of the corporation which last month announced a 
restructuring that includes refinancing of debt a salary freeze 
layoffs and the sale of up to 590 stores deemed unprofitable 
on dec 7 circle 7 announced a dec 15 deadline to get ahead of 
its debt service with 20 million in credit 
it said the banks which are part of its revolvingcredit 
agreement agreed to make 10 million available and american 
financial corp circle ks largest stockholder agreed to advance 
the same amount 
the new agreement includes the banks american financial and 
certain issuers of letters of credit which have consented 
to refrain from taking actions to reduce their extensions of credit 
during the term of the shortterm agreement cox said in his 
statement 
the covenants apply to 200 million in senior secured notes due 
oct 15 1993 they require circle k to maintain at the end of each 
quarter a minimum fixedcoverage ratio for the preceding 12 months 
cox said 
funds to make such payment are not presently available to the 
company cox said 
he said failure to meet the profit levels or negotiate the 
agreement struck late friday would have forced the company to buy 
back 20 million of the longterm debt 
according to company figures circle k has longterm debt of 
about 11 billion up from 844 million the year before and paid 
96 million in interest and debt expenses during the 1989 fiscal 
year 
the companys financial woes followed explosive expansion which 
saw circle k grow from about 1000 convenience stores in 1984 to a 
high of 4685 the financial statement friday said the total had 
dropped to 4677 
the company owns about 12 percent of the stores the others are
