in the history of american jurisprudence no 
criminal prosecution has lasted longer nor taken a greater toll 
financially and emotionally than the mcmartin preschool 
molestation case 
reputations were ruined and lives were shattered a school was 
demolished and the justice system took a beating as mcmartin became 
a symbol of legal excess 
seven years and 135 million after it began the last act in 
the saga of raymond buckey and the teachers of the mcmartin school 
was played out friday in a los angeles courtroom 
a mistrial was declared in buckeys retrial after the jury said 
it was hopelessly deadlocked on eight child molestation counts 
district attorney ira reiner said there would not be a third trial 
buckey once among seven defendants sat alone before the jury 
in his second trial six women including his mother sister and 
grandmother were cleared in earlier proceedings 
the abbreviated second trial lasting three months was a sharp 
contrast to the first marathon mcmartin trial which stretched to 
nearly three years an 18month preliminary hearing had preceded 
that case 
as months and years passed in the mcmartin case a new decade 
dawned and time became the enemy of the truthseeking process 
the children who were alleged to have been molested at the 
manhattan beach nursery school grew up in the second trial 
onetime toddlers grown to adolescence strained to remember on the 
witness stand a time now lost in the dim haze of childhood memories 
they furrowed their brows searching for answers saying again 
and again i dont remember 
the truth never had a chance buckeys attorney danny 
davis told jurors in closing arguments we never heard from the 
children we heard from little adults 
deputy district attorney pam ferrero told the jurors this 
particular case boils down to credibility who do you believe if 
you believe the children then the people have proved their case 
beyond a reasonable doubt 
buckey took the stand at both trials and denied ever molesting 
any children 
the young girls said they were molested by buckey but their 
recollection of details was sketchy one girl who earlier accused 
buckeys mother peggy mcmartin buckey of lewd acts shocked 
participants in the second trial by calmly saying under oath that 
none of it was true mrs buckey 63 who spent two years in jail 
and three years on trial based on such accusations had already 
been acquitted 
time also changed raymond buckey he spent five years in jail 
awaiting resolution of his case until a judge decided he should be 
released on 15 million bail he emerged a seemingly different 
person the gangly selfconscious 25yearold who was arrested in 
1983 had matured into a man of 32 carefully groomed articulate 
and confident as he faced tv cameras for daily hallway interviews 
proclaiming his innocence 
its been close to seven years of my life and now its come to 
a finale mcmartin two the summer rerun buckey told reporters 
one day 
and after the trial his only occupation for years 
i dont know what ill do he said maybe grow christmas 
trees in oregon maybe give advice on how you survive a witch 
hunt 
moments before his second mistrial was declared buckey summed 
it up this way ive gone from probably one of the most hated 
people you could ever mention to a point of where everybody 
that comes up to me now is very sympathetic and theyre saying i 
always thought you were innocent 
the first trial was a gutwrenching drama starring prosecutors 
and defense attorneys seemingly obsessed with the case parents of 
mcmartin children crowded the courtroom to watch 124 witnesses tv 
and newspapers trumpeted bizarre allegations of satanic rituals 
animal sacrifices and supernatural occurrences at the school 
superior court judge william pounders who presided at the first 
trial said the case poisoned everyone who touched it the mother 
whose first molestation report ignited the wildfire of accusations 
died of alcoholism before the trial began a defense investigator 
committed suicide during the trial 
the second trial which began april 6 was a toneddown affair 
except for buckey and his attorney danny davis the cast of 
characters had changed a new judge presided and two new 
prosecutors seemed determined to remain detached from the passions 
that consumed their predecessors 
the mcmartin school was closed and ultimately demolished after 
parents excavated the grounds in search of underground tunnels 
where they believed children had been molested they turned up 
little conclusive evidence 
teachers reputations were destroyed and some of them moved away 
to escape the stigma 
district attorney ira reiners political career also fell victim 
to the mcmartin case when the first jury deadlocked on 13 charges 
against buckey parents pressured reiner to refile the counts 
buckey had been acquitted on another 40 counts 
reiner then a candidate for state attorney general decided to 
reprosecute buckey on eight charges involving three children the 
mcmartin case was widely blamed for reiners election defeat in the 
june primary

after two months of legal arguments that 
held up six death sentences florida proved its electric chair 
works by executing a killer who said he felt no guilt for robbing 
raping and stabbing a woman 
anthony bertolotti 38 died friday evening in the first 
electrocution carried out by the state since may 4 when flame and 
smoke shot from the headpiece of the electric chair during the 
execution of jesse tafero 
state and federal courts stayed the executions of bertolotti and 
five other death row inmates while considering arguments from 
defense lawyers that the 66yearold chair would torture their 
clients to death 
an orlando trial court conducted tests on the chair and ruled 
wednesday it was fit for use the 11th circuit court of appeal and 
the us supreme court concurred and the execution went forward 
friday evening 
bertolotti jerked back in the chair clenched his fists and 
slumped after each of the three surges administered by the hooded 
executioner 
there were white whisps of smoke as is usual for the 
electrocutions but no signs of malfunction bertolotti was 
declared dead at 707 pm 
the execution was floridas 23rd since it resumed capital 
punishment in 1979 and the 136th in the nation since the supreme 
court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 
the state had concluded that an artificial sponge used in 
place of a natural sponge under the electrode in the headpiece 
burst into flame during the tafero electrocution gov bob martinez 
said the sponge had been replaced and the chair worked properly 
bertolottis lawyers lost their argument that the chair was 
faulty in a hearing wednesday before us district judge g kendall 
sharp in orlando 
a threejudge panel rejected the condemned mans claim that 
sharps ruling was unfounded and the us supreme court rejected 
the case after taking it up about half an hour before the sentence 
was carried out 
it is gratifying that the courts concluded floridas electric 
chair does in fact work as it is designed to that fact was borne 
out by extensive testing earlier this week and the completion of 
this execution proves it conclusively martinez said 
the 11th circuit court of appeal held up three other death 
warrants and state courts held up two others while the chairs 
function was tested other matters of appeal stood in the way of 
some of those death sentences 
bertolotti was sentenced to die for the sept 27 1983 murder 
of carol ward 48 of orlando she was working in her yard when 
bertolotti approached and asked to use the telephone and she let 
him in 
he grabbed a knife and robbed her of 30 then stabbed her 
repeatedly until the knife broke he found another knife and 
stabbed her until she died leaving the knife in her body at some 
point bertolotti removed her clothes and raped her he was 
convicted march 31 1984 
bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors after his 
conviction saying he wasnt sorry 
i have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of carol ward 
he wrote she should have locked her damn door i really did a 
favor by taking her life dont you think so

two years after investigators in new bedford began 
tracking leads in the serial killings of at least nine women 
attorney kenneth pontes name has been printed in many places but 
not on an arrest warrant 
he blames the prosecutor for floating his name 
hes ruined my career as a lawyer hes ruined my life 
ponte 40 said thursday in an interview from florida 
when i walk up or down any street little kids call me 
murderer 
those statements chafe bristol county district attorney ronald 
pina whose office has never publicly identified a suspect in the 
deaths 
its irritating because its easy to say its the district 
attorneys fault pinas spokesman jim martin said recently 
ponte is neither the first nor the only victim of innuendo 
the guilt of four different men has been widely speculated upon 
since the case heated up in the fall 1988 however none has been 
charged 
today only pontes name still shows up regularly in headlines 
at last count he said 254 newspaper articles had linked his name 
with the case 
hes been painted for a long period of time with the brush of 
being the suspected serial killer and that will never rub 
off said edward f harrington an attorney for a suspect who 
fell out of vogue months ago 
jonathan klarfeld director of boston universitys print 
journalism program finds fault with law enforcement authorities 
for floating such stories 
if theres fault on the part of the media its in letting 
themselves be used in this way he said 
ponte knew several of the victims all drug users some 
prostitutes their bodies turned up along highways in southeastern 
massachusetts between july 1988 and april 1989 
though convicted long ago on charges including narcotics and 
breaking and entering ponte received a pardon from gov francis 
sargent in 1975 legally clearing his slate 
if pina thinks i did something and he thinks he has 
evidence then charge me and let me come into court ponte said 
thursday but to harass me and indict me by publication for two 
years ive been punished more than most people who have been 
convicted of serious crimes 
harrington said his client like ponte has not been the same 
since his name was dragged into the investigation anthony degrazia 
was arrested on rape and assault and battery charges at the height 
of the investigation in may 1989 
almost overnight after his interview with the das office he 
was put in the limelight as being the latest suspect in the highway 
serial killings harrington said he couldnt raise his head 
above his shoulders because people were pointing him out on the 
street 
martin said the district attorneys office has been chagrined to 
watch the parade of alleged suspects trotted out 
for a while in a notsofunny joke it became the suspect of 
the week he acknowledged 
but dont lay the blame with the district attorney martin said 
adding 
i dont fault the media for doing their job what does 
become a problem is when the reporting oversteps the line and 
becomes the investigation 
ponte moved to port richey fla in 1988 and was arrested there 
june 12 for allegedly assaulting a woman he was released two weeks 
ago on personal recognizance because prosecutors produced no 
evidence against him 
after his release ponte wanted to return to new bedford to stay 
with his 65yearold mother 
he wanted to clear his name but a bizarre twist stopped him 
short 
ponte said his mother unwittingly bought a house next door to 
pina last year when the district attorney heard of pontes plans 
he obtained a restraining order based on secret grand jury 
testimony presented to a judge 
a witness claimed ponte told her he intended to kill the 
district attorney his wife and daughter the witness later 
disputed the characterization of her testimony 
but ponte suggested that pina whos up for reelection this 
year sought the order for reasons other than concern for his 
familys safety 
the first rule of any politician is to get reelected ponte 
said if he drops me as a suspect hes admitting to the public 
that hes wasted their money hes got to hang this on somebody

dozens of the nations top filmmakers 
convinced the film rating system makes no sense are asking the 
motion picture association of america to overhaul its cinematic 
score sheet 
it doesnt work said barry levinson the oscarwinning 
director of rain man and other hits its a poor system to 
begin with 
levinson is among 31 prestigious filmmakers who signed a 
petition that was delivered tuesday to the mpaa other signers 
included francis ford coppola paul mazursky spike lee and sydney 
pollack 
the outcry prompted by x ratings given to several critically 
acclaimed films has grown so intense that the president of the 
mpaa says hell listen to the directors criticisms 
but jack valentis attentive ear is unlikely to end the debate 
since he says he has no intention of changing the rules 
a new york state judge while upholding the x rating of tie me 
up tie me down on july 19 criticized the rating system judge 
charles ramos said it borders on censorship and if not reformed may 
face legal challenges 
many directors and producers say the x rating amounts to a kiss 
of death at the box office because it is synonymous with hardcore 
graphic sexual films it should not be used to label maturethemed 
films of higher artistic ambition they say 
an a rating these filmmakers suggest should be created for 
nonpornographic adult films 
the x rating has come to represent pornography said harvey 
weinstein the cochairman of miramax films whose releases include 
tie me up tie me down and another xrated movie the cook 
the thief his wife amp her lover 
the x rating of midnight cowboy and a clockwork orange is 
now confused with the x rating of debbie does dallas 
wayne wang the wellregarded director of the recently xrated 
feature talk is cheap but toilet paper is expensive said 
we tried to make a film to comment on violence and pornography 
and we are told that we are violent and pornographic ourselves 
the world is changing and the rating system should change 
with it 
in may the national society of film critics pressed for the new 
a rating valenti said this week he intended to meet with some of 
the directors petitioning for the change but he maintains that the 
rating procedure works 
if you add another category youre asking the rating board to 
make judgments about artistic integrity he said trying to 
decide which film about bestiality and incest is artistic and 
therefore deserves an a rating and which film about bestiality and 
incest is not artistic and therefore deserves an x rating is 
impossible 
valenti said the x rating is not equivalent to pornography it 
means it is an adult film no reasonable parent he said would 
let children see the films the mpaa rates x 
he said parents are happy with the work of the 11member ratings 
board 
richard heffner chairman of the mpaas classification and 
rating administration said the identities of the film raters are 
kept secret so they wont be unfairly pressured but he said all 
are parents 
heffner said the number of films getting a tentative x 
rating from the board has been consistent in the past he said 
filmmakers drawing these preliminary marks would edit their movies 
to earn an r rating this year he said several directors refused 
to recut their works more x ratings resulted 
the trade newspaper daily variety in a column by laurence cohn 
defended the rating system saying filmmakers should accept the 
rating and run with it 
two of the nations largest movie exhibitors general cinema 
and national amusements representing a combined 2250 screens 
domestically generally do not show xrated films 
many newspapers and most tv and radio stations do not accept ads 
for most xrated films 
a movie bearing an x rating then has little chance of 
recouping its costs critics of the rating say 
shapiroglickenhaus is releasing its film frankenhooker 
without a rating because the mpaa ratings board ruled it too harsh 
for an r 
frankenhooker is a much less explicitly gruesome film than 
total recall which got an r said james glickenhaus president 
of the independent film company 
many critics say the ratings are arbitrary and communicate 
little about a films true subject matter mace neufeld producer 
of the upcoming release flight of the intruder said if he uses 
more than one fword his film will be rated r instead of the 
desired pg13 
so im going through the film trying to decide which of the 
five fwords is the most important neufeld said thats 
absurd 
as defined by the mpaa the g rating is for all ages pg means 
some material may not be suitable for children pg13 means some 
material may be inappropriate for children under 13 r says patrons 
under 17 require an accompanying parent or adult guardian and x 
means no one under 17 admitted age limit may vary in certain 
areas

across the mediterranean basin a major summer 
drought has killed dozens of people destroyed crops dried up 
rivers forced rationing and sparked water wars 
french farmers are sabotaging water pumps that supply city 
dwellers a twomonth heat wave left 38 people dead in algeria 
half of italys olive crop has been destroyed residents of 
istanbul turkey are limited to four hours of water a day 
in greece the drought is the worst in 100 years forcing the 
government to raise water prices 300 percent in an effort to drive 
down consumption 
supertankers are shipping water to hardhit greek coastal areas 
and geologists drilling for fresh supplies agricultural 
cooperatives say farmers have sustained losses of 2 billion 
the greek government plans to divert the central evinos river to 
replenish reservoirs around athens where the current supply would 
last only 98 days 
much of france is suffering a second year of drought a heat 
wave last weekend claimed five lives including a farmer who 
dropped dead while installing irrigation equipment 
a persistent atlantic highpressure system has held rainfall in 
normandy and the entire southern third of the country to 50 percent 
below average dozens of towns have banned lawnwatering and 
carwashing 
in the regions of france where its dry its the driest for 
10 years meteorologist guy la riviere of the national weather 
service said friday 
officials in the southwestern aude region where rationing has 
been in effect since 1989 reported anxious farmers were illegally 
diverting water to save corn and sunflower crops 
farmers occasionally sabotage public water pumps they consider 
to be stealing water from their sunbaked fields officials say 
the acts become more dramatic as the situation gets more 
urgent said jeanpierre monod president of a farming 
cooperative 
lack of rain has left major rivers like the loire rhone and 
garonne at half their normal levels when temperatures in the 
garonne climbed to 82 degrees fahrenheit on monday the goflech 
nuclear power plant shut down because the river water was too hot 
to cool the reactor 
across the mediterranean in algeria a twomonth heat wave has 
been blamed for 38 deaths in the southern city of ain salah 
temperatures consistently hovered at 104 degrees 
in algiers residents stockpiled water and braced for a 
governmentordered suspension of supplies sunday and monday water 
reserves have dropped by twothirds in the capital the past two 
years 
in italy rainfall so far this year has been nearly 40 percent 
below average said lt col paolo ernani of the weather bureau 
more than half the olive harvest has been destroyed and the 
drought will seriously affect production for next years crop 
according the main consortium of italian olive oil producers 
the island of sardinia has asked the government to declare a 
state of emergency the bootheel region of puglia has already 
received such designation along with 400000 in aid 
in turkey two years of drought have parched most coastal and 
inland regions except along the black sea in the north waterworks 
and meteorology officials said 
in some quarters of istanbul the only water available for 
washing is in public baths and drinking supplies are limited to 
four hours per day 
in portugal hot dry conditions caused the number of forest 
fires between june 15 and july 23 to increase by onefourth over 
the same period last year said national fire service chief 
cristiano santos 
fires also destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest and 
brush in eastern southern and northwestern spain southern france 
and parts of italy 
one blaze on the slopes of mount vesuvius has raged since 
monday and a wildfire burned out of control friday on the greek

in the coalmining town of nalaikh 
lhagvadorj the driver was expressing doubt that preparations for 
sundays elections were fair suddenly an angry woman strode up 
and began berating him 
she says that we are agitating against the communist party 
lhagvadorj said after the woman fell into sullen silence she is 
a member 
asked if he was afraid the driver looked serious 
she will certainly tell the officials about this he said 
adding that it could get him in trouble 
in mongolias capital of ulan bator communist party leaders say 
they want the countrys first multiparty elections to be fair they 
say they are willing to share power with opposition parties 
demanding human rights and a market economy and express support 
for those goals 
but the scene in nalaikh just outside ulan bator dramatized a 
key obstacle local communists unwilling to give up the absolute 
power the party held for nearly seven decades 
this spring popular demonstrations in ulan bator inspired by 
the anticommunist revolution in eastern europe forced the 
communists formally known as the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party to overhaul their leadership legalize opposition parties 
and reduce controls on religion and the media 
but lhagvadorj and many opposition supporters said friday the 
communists still controlled too many aspects of the election 
process 
the first round of balloting held last sunday knocked out 
about onethird of the fledgling oppositions candidates for the 
430seat legislature the great peoples hural 
the final round of voting comes sunday 
lhagvadorj who like most mongolians uses only one name said 
candidates were supposed to be nominated by the people this time 
but he said the first he heard of nominations was when officials 
brought the final list around 
other nalaikh residents nodded in agreement 
the nominees are mostly the chiefs top officials not from 
among the workers said munhkjargal a worker 
but we cannot do anything said a young man we have to 
give our vote to one of them 
with the opposition still in the running for only about 100 
great hurals seats the communists are guaranteed victory but the 
nalaikh voters comments indicate that a communist victory cannot 
be interpreted as a rejection of reform 
a better barometer may be the party popularity poll on sundays 
ballot voters are to mark which party they support in addition to 
choosing a candidate who may or may not be from that party 
the results will be used to allocate seats in the new small 
hural a 53seat body that will meet in between the great hurals 
annual sessions it will draft and pass legislation which the 
great hural can overturn and handle daytoday matters 
opposition leaders say they believe they could capture a 
majority in the small hural 
all the parties seemed uncomfortable with the messiness of 
pluralistic politics there were few election posters and no 
debates many candidates simply sponsored free concerts or movies 
in their district to gain name recognition 
although all parties say they want greater personal freedoms 
rule of law less central planning and other reforms they differ 
widely in the pace and boldness of such moves

perfectly happy being married to someone outside show business 
her husband fred tillman is a newport beach yacht broker and 
the 32yearold actress says she took it as a compliment when a 
tabloid newspaper reported she had married a complete nobody 
i have lived with actors and dated actors and personally i 
found it really boring said miss mcgillis who starred opposite 
tom cruise in top gun

a farm bill that keeps major support programs 
and increases environmental protection is the most progressive 
agricultural law ever passed by the senate the agriculture 
committee chairman says 
the 54 billion measure setting farm policy and spending for 
the next five years was approved friday the house version is 
expected to pass next week followed by a conference committee to 
iron out any differences between the two versions 
its the most progressive farm bill ive seen come out of this 
body said sen patrick leahy dvt who guided the bill to the 
final 7021 vote after taking a strong interest in seeing 
environmental provisions strengthened 
the bill establishes pricesupport programs for commodities and 
sets policy for nutrition programs agricultural exports soil and 
water conservation agricultural research and extension work food 
inspection and other responsibilities of the agriculture department 
among the environmental breakthroughs in the bill is a ban on 
the export of agricultural chemicals illegal in the united states 
the bill also establishes standards for use of the phrase 
organically grown and lays down new policies designed to 
protect wetlands and forests 
significant additions to the bill included sanctions against 
iraq and limits on loans that could be made to the soviet union 
the house and senate both voted friday to use the farm bill 
against iraq by cutting off us loan guarantees the country uses 
to buy american wheat rice lumber cattle and commercial goods 
such as tires and machinery 
the senate voted to restrict loans to the soviet union by 
preventing lending institutions from offering credit at a lower 
rate to the soviets than to farmers unless the funds are used to 
buy us agricultural products 
among those voting against the senate bill was sen thomas 
daschle dsd a member of leahys committee who said the price 
support structure in the measure would drive many farmers in his 
state out of business 
leahy and the committees ranking republican sen richard lugar 
of indiana said budget negotiations would lead to cuts in farm 
subsidy spending 
despite seven days of debate which sometimes lasted late into 
the night the bill emerged from the senate virtually the same as 
when it went to the floor said leahy 
the big expense in the bill is in price supports which assure 
farmers of a certain level of income even if market prices are low 
the bush administration was never happy with the amount the 
senate sought to spend on support programs and threatened a veto 
before floor debate if the costs werent brought down agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter suggested that congress wait until a 
budget summit agreement was reached before acting on the bill 
i have no intention of seeing the bill finished in conference 
until there has been a summit agreement leahy said 
lugar said the bill was structured to allow for cutting what was 
necessary without tearing apart major programs 
republican leader bob dole of kansas said the bill followed the 
philosophy of the law passed in 1985 but he added the problem 
with the 1985 farm bill was that it cost about 80 billion in 
program outlays we no longer have 80 billion to spend 
he said the spending projected by 1990 bill might have to be 
pared back as much as 25 billion a year 
final senate approval of the bill came after compromises and 
speedy approval of dozens of amendments that had held up progress 
for days 
one of the stickiest disputes was between great lakes and gulf 
coast senators about the amount of food aid to foreign countries 
that should be shipped out of great lakes ports 
sens john glenn dohio and john breaux dla agreed to a 
formula that limits the great lakes to 240000 tons of food aid 
cargo annually and allows them to use less costly foreign ships 
that fly an american flag and use american crews

ties with albania the foreign ministry spokesman said 
that is our position ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said friday so it might be assumed that those 
relations will be resumed

1961 as a result of a split with china which then became albanias 
chief communist ally 
albania the last hardline communist state in europe also has 
no relations with washington or moscow it has said it will resist 
the democratic reforms that have swept eastern europe 
earlier this month more than 4500 albanian citizens demanding 
change sought refuge in foreign embassies in the capital tirana

marion barrys drug and perjury trial will go 
to the jury next week without jurors hearing the mayor defend 
himself or face questions from prosecutors 
after the defense closed its case friday prosecutors alleged in 
rebuttal that a defense witness lied when giving testimony that 
undermined a cocaine possession charge against barry 
barry didnt testify saying he wanted to avoid theatrics 
it would have been good perry mason drama la law drama but 
im not about perry mason drama the district of columbia mayor 
said after the days session 
my spirits are high my defense is on course 
in the rebuttal the government introduced a document showing 
that city employee clifton roberson wasnt even working at the time 
he said he accepted a job application from an admitted drug dealer 
the dealer lydia pearson had said she went to a city office on 
sept 7 1988 and handed a job application to the mayor along 
with crack cocaine 
roberson had testified it was he not the mayor who met with 
pearson that day roberson said he got the application from 
pearson that barry was nowhere in the vicinity and that there was 
no crack 
but roberson was laying a gravestone for his fathers grave at 
the time he said he was taking the application according to a 
document prosecutors found in city files 
the document notifies roberson that he was absent without 
official leave 
testifying friday at barrys trial city worker darcelle walker 
recalled that roberson had been upset over the incident for 
which he was docked two hours pay 
defense attorney r kenneth mundy suggested that roberson was 
absent in the late afternoon rather than the morning when the job 
application was turned in 
roberson is an assistant to longtime barry aide anita bonds who 
has sat throughout the trial at the mayors side assisting his 
defense 
outside the courtroom barry said he believed roberson had been 
at work when pearson left the application 
i know i didnt take it barry said of the job application 
after the defense rested its case friday walker was one of four 
rebuttal witnesses called by the government to attack barrys 
defense 
as part of its rebuttal case the prosecution also called delois 
mise she testified that she saw barry bodyguard police officer 
james stays snort cocaine at a 1985 party stays had testified for 
the defense that he never saw barry use drugs on a march 1988 trip 
to the virgin islands stays denied that he himself had used drugs 
at the 1985 party mundy said he wants to recall stays next week 
before closing arguments 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
department planned an internal investigation of stays as soon as 
the trial is over 
barry is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession three 
felony counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy 
the trial is expected to go to the jury by the middle of next

fortyeight years after doolittles 
raiders first pierced the skies of japan the squadrons navigator 
is joining the search for planes that crashed after the successful 
bombing mission 
retired col henry a potter said friday he will join five 
others in a search in zhejiang province china where potters and 
four other b25b bombers went down after the april 18 1942 
mission it was the first successful air raid against japan during 
world war ii 
the 16plane squadron from the uss hornet boosted the morale of 
the american public following the december 1941 attack on pearl 
harbor the plane flown by col james h doolittle was the first 
fully loaded bomber ever to take off from an aircraft carrier 
the mission was so secret that even president franklin roosevelt 
was not informed said potter 71 of austin texas 
doolittle trained the crews for the short takeoffs at a landing 
strip in florida potter was the navigator of doolittles lead 
bomber 
i dont think we exhibited any more courage than anyone 
else potter said recalling the 467foot takeoff i dont 
think any of us thought about anything other than that we were 
doing our jobs 
the skies cleared before the planes reached their targets and 
the bombs were dropped successfully on key industrial sites 
the bombers tried to flee japanese air space and land on 
mainland china but stormy weather made it impossible for them to 
reach safe haven 
one of the planes landed in russia the other 15 landed in the 
water near the china coast or crashed after the crews bailed out 
according to an official war department report of the mission 
all 80 crew members made it to the ground safely but eight were 
captured by the japanese of those three were executed by their 
captors one died in prison and four were released when the war 
ended the government report says 
fortyfour of the original doolittle raiders including 
doolittle are still alive and meet annually potter said 
doolittle is 93 and lives in carmel calif 
potter said there has been talk about searching for the planes 
over the years but said the expedition near the mountain villages 
of linan and quzhou in an area to the south of shanghai will be 
the first 
bryan moon an artist and history buff is leading the 
expedition 
this was one of the most important events in american aviation 
history it needs to have the is dotted and the ts crossed 
moon said 
aside from potter none of the expedition members have links to 
the bombing mission the expedition will leave minneapolis on sept 
6 with a planned threeweek stay in china 
moon 62 a former northwest airlines vice president who lives 
in frontenac minn has led expeditions around the world in 1986 
he discovered the lost grave of joy adamson the lionlover of 
born free fame in kenya he served as an artist for the north 
and south pole expeditions of ely minnbased explorer will steger 
the doolittle expedition is being paid for by the participants 
it has the full cooperation of officials of the provincial 
government said xiangling zhao the chinese counsul 
i am very happy that this group can go to china on this 
historical mission he told a news conference i wish them good 
luck

the contention by mayor marion barrys 
attorney that the fbi is targeting black officials for sting 
operations is a new twist on the argument that black officeholders 
get more than their fair share of law enforcement scrutiny 
but the fbi on friday continued to reject both arguments 
including the notion that it has an assault force roaming the 
country trying to create evidence to prosecute black officials 
theres no way you could hide something like that fbi 
spokesman greg jones said there are people upstanding enough in 
the fbi that it would get out its not like the old place 
barrys attorney in his cocaine and perjury trial r kenneth 
mundy told the trial judge thursday that the fbi had targeted 
andrew young julian bond and other black leaders in chicago and 
california for undercover sting operations 
mundy said out of the presence of the jury that fbi agent ronald 
stern whose sting operation videotaped barry smoking crack 
cocaine in effect moves around the country as the head of an 
assault force of fbi agents 
assistant us attorney judith retchin responded there is 
absolutely no truth to the allegation 
said jones there is not a group that crisscrosses the country 
targeting black officials 
the fbi has no numbers to show its investigations have been 
balanced racially because it doesnt keep such statistics he said 
there is no way the fbi could differentiate by race the number 
of individuals weve investigated jones said i think it would 
be ludicrous to i dont think the public would stand for it 
a congressional source said he has seen details from black 
officials on the allegations but he has never seen sterns name 
connected with any of them 
in addition he said there had never been mention of any roving 
task force and he added that such a force is not a concept that i 
know of in the fbi 
one of the most prominent cases has been that of birmingham 
ala mayor richard arrington a former college professor who says 
he has been the subject of fbi scrutiny since the early 1970s and 
was the target of several sting operations from 1987 through 1989 
arringtons attorney donald v watkins compiled a report 
detailing operations against other black officials and submitted 
that report to the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility 
the report includes details from affidavits submitted by atlanta 
attorney and former fbi undercover operative hirsch friedman he 
testified in 1987 that the fbi had a policy called fruhmenschen a 
german term for primitive man that selectively targeted 
africanamerican elected and appointed officials for investigation 
according to the report 
the friedman affidavits said the policy was based on the 
assumption by the fbi that black officials were intellectually and 
socially incapable of governing major governmental operations and 
institutions 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said the opr which 
investigates allegations of wrongdoing by department officials 
is reviewing the allegations that the mayor of birmingham has 
brought to us but we cannot comment further 
barry has said since long before he was arrested in january that 
prosecutors unfairly singled him out for investigation because he 
is a prominent black officeholder 
naacp executive director benjamin l hooks recently echoed those 
complaints telling the washington post that prosecutors had spent 
millions of dollars pursuing such black politicians as barry while 
ignoring those lying conniving thieving savings and loan 
officials who robbed this country blind 
attorney general thornburgh angrily denied such suggestions 
saying we are prosecuting people on the basis of whether or not 
there is legally admissible evidence to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt their wrongdoing regardless of race religion or color or 
political affiliation

congressional republicans are denouncing 
democrats for failing to offer a plan to cut next years deficit 
and are badly split over a bush administration proposal that 
includes boosts in liquor taxes 
democrats said friday they are in little hurry to make a 
budgetcutting offer to republicans with a 54 billion white house 
package of tax increases and spending cuts under fire republicans 
complained that it is the democrats turn to ante up 
this is when you finally get off your butt and do something 
said the no 2 senate republican sen alan simpson of wyoming 
its a shame people are trying to figure out how not to work 
together said white house chief of staff john sununu 
democrats met friday and said they discussed plans to enact a 
compromise budget pact with republicans after congress returns from 
its monthlong august recess fiscal 1991 begins oct 1 and deep 
cuts in federal spending will be triggered by the grammrudman law 
unless the projected 169 billion deficit is cut sharply 
it looks to me like its doubtful the democrats will produce a 
package before september said senate budget committee chairman 
james sasser dtenn 
gop officials speaking on condition they not be identified 
said it appeared that the administration plan included an increase 
in the tax on hard liquor the plan would boost the current 198 
federal levy on a 750milliliter bottle to 254 
on thursday republicans said the plan would increase the 
federal tax on a sixpack of beer from 16 cents to 81 cents and 
from 3 cents to 76 cents on a 750milliliter bottle of wine 
another element of the white house plan would limit the amount 
of state and local income taxes that can be deducted on federal tax 
returns to 10000 officials said almost everyone who would be 
affected by that plan earns more than 100000 annually 
both of these elements drew fire from some republicans 
a lot of members realize the regressivity of beer and wine 
taxes said rep jerry lewis rcalif the no 3 house 
republican youre talking about a big wallop to that 
middleincome family 
the normally loyal sen pete domenici rnm the ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee said no comment 
when asked what he thought of the plan 
sen phil gramm rtexas said of the proposal you can agree 
or disagree and i do both 
congressional leaders discussed their budget problems for the 
fourth consecutive morning with president bush at the white house 
later house speaker thomas s foley dwash said it appeared 
likely that negotiators would meet at times over the congressional 
recess 
besides higher alcohol taxes and limits on tax deductibility 
the white house also proposed freezing benefits for federal 
civilian and military retirees for one year the plan would save 
the government 14 billion next year by eliminating for one year 
the annual increase such pensioners receive to compensate for 
inflation 
on thursday no 2 house republican newt gingrich rga 
distributed a letter to his colleagues saying any plan with 
costofliving freezes will not have my support domenici 
circulated a similar letter 
lewis said that further bad feelings arose because republicans 
met for 90 minutes thursday with sununu and white house budget 
chief richard darman but were provided no details of what was in 
the budget proposal 
were tired of them coming down to massage us but not being 
willing to be specific with us said lewis its created a rub 
within the republican conference thats not helpful in supporting 
the administrations position 
the white house plan would also cut benefit programs by 16 
billion including 6 billion in medicare cuts cut defense by 
about 7 billion and slash domestic and foreign aid programs by 4 
billion 
the white house package also contains many elements of the 
budget bush proposed in january these include a cut in the capital 
gains tax rate which the president says would encourage sales of 
property and thereby add to federal revenues it would also boost 
various federal fees by 56 billion

the political arms of labor unions 
corporations and trade associations could be the big losers in 
senate efforts to clean up the way politicians raise money for 
elections 
senate democrats on friday joined republicans in calling for a 
total abolition of the special interest political action committees 
responsible for raising 45 million of the 180 million spent on 
senate campaigns in the 1988 elections 
with the senate scheduled to vote next week on campaign finance 
reform legislation the move by democratic leaders effectively 
denied republicans a chance to force a vote on pacs and portray 
democrats as opponents of reform 
for months republicans have been calling for abolition of the 
committees which have tended to bestow an overwhelming majority of 
their largesse in recent campaigns on incumbent congressional 
democrats 
also deleted from the democratic reform package friday was a 
plan opposed by virtually all republicans and many democrats for 
the government to pay 70 percent of a candidates general election 
campaign costs through a voluntary taxpayer checkoff 
they kept talking about pacs and public financing boren 
said of republicans we hope they will reciprocate by taking in 
spending limits 
the democratic moves were the latest in a flurry of efforts by 
each party to portray itself as the conciliating agent of reform 
and the opposing party as the obstacle to it before the senate 
begins debating the issue monday 
republican leaders on thursday for the first time offered to 
accept at least a notion of an aggregate ceiling on how much a 
candidate can raise but only for outofstate contributions in 
excess of 250 each 
senate candidates under the gop proposal could still raise 
unlimited funds from instate voters and through directmail 
campaigns to outofstate donors of less than 250 
the gop which a much more advanced computerized directmail 
apparatus than democrats contend a ceiling on total spending would 
prevent challengers from buying the tv ads most of them need to 
match an incumbents name recognition 
because of constitutional concerns that an outright ban on pacs 
might be ruled a violation of first amendment rights of free 
speech both parties have a fallback position to reduce how much 
each pac could contribute to a single candidate 
the current maximum allowable contribution a candidate can 
receive from any one pac is 5000 each for primary runoff and 
general elections the fallback provision would cut that amount to 
1000 
boren and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
democrats remain united on insisting that any bill have an absolute 
ceiling on total aggregate spending 
their proposal currently calls for ceilings of 1 million to 
55 million for each of the primary runoff and general elections 
based on the size of each states voting age population democrats 
however have said they are willing to raise the lids if it would 
pick up republican votes 
house democratic leaders meanwhile were still undecided on 
whether to bring up rival campaign finance measures for a vote next 
week before recessing for an august vacation 
two democratic bills would place a spending ceiling of 550000 
on house races one would limit pac contributions to half that 
amount or 275000 with no public financing the other would 
limit pacs to 240000 with 100000 of public financing 
like their senate counterparts house republicans are opposing 
any campaign ceilings they also would limit individual pac 
contributions to a candidate to 1000 for each election

for raymond buckey a jury deadlock marked 
the end of a sevenyear ordeal five years of which he spent in 
jail convicted of nothing but charged with the unspeakable crime 
of child molestation 
ive gone from probably one of the most hated people you could 
ever mention to a point of where everybody that comes up to me now 
is very sympathetic and theyre saying i always thought you were 
innocent buckey said after a mistrial was declared friday 
buckey was retried on charges he molested children at the 
mcmartin preschool prosecutors said they wouldnt try him a third 
time bringing to a close the longest criminal case in us history 
i dont know if anyone can understand the feeling of waiting 
seven years for someone to decide your fate buckey said 
during his first trial buckey was charged with dozens of 
molestation counts and acquitted of 40 
eight charges were refiled against him in votes taken during 15 
days of deliberation jurors leaned toward acquittal on seven of 
the eight counts the eighth was split 66 on friday they said 
unanimous verdicts were impossible 
the tall squarejawed buckey said the years in jail were tough 
its like a war zone in there 
but he acknowledged that the ordeal made me a very strong 
person 
buckey displayed some bitterness as he spoke of the cost exacted 
by his family the loss of their home their once prestigious 
school in manhattan beach and the damage to their reputations he 
blamed those who would not let the case go away and those who 
played a political game with my life 
it was salem revisited he said it was mccarthyism one 
more time 
buckey who began the case as a gawky selfconscious 
25yearold seemed to grow in stature as the case progressed he 
is now 32 and appears confident articulate and wellgroomed 
once he left his glib attorney danny davis to talk to 
reporters toward the end he faced the tv cameras himself with 
direct thoughtful answers that made him his own best spokesman 
he took the witness stand sunburned from his return to the 
seaside he loved and told jurors he never molested any children 
im innocent he said after the jury had deadlocked there 
was the presumption of innocence at the start of this i was 
innocent coming in and im still innocent because i wasnt found 
guilty 
buckey said he hoped society would gain from his case but also 
predicted the public would forget it in time 
theyll remember the mcmartin phenomenon he said but 
given time something else will come along to make headlines and 
ill be anonymous and thats what i want 
asked what he would do with the rest of his life buckey said 
i would like to be just left alone id like to move out of the 
city and find a little fresh air this is not the kind of life i 
would have planned out 
he added with a smile ill have to get a job now

doctors believe the leukemia that has 
hospitalized czechoslovakias ambassador might have been caused by 
radioactive fallout from the 1986 soviet nuclear accident at 
chernobyl a czech embassy official says 
ambassador rita klimova 59 is in johns hopkins hospital in 
nearby baltimore where she faces perhaps four weeks of 
chemotherapy treatment the czechoslovak embassy said friday 
the ambassadors son vladimir mlynar visiting her from prague 
said his mother feels quite good and said she is slightly 
optimistic according to embassy official laco mravec 
mrs klimovas leukemia cancer of the white blood cells was 
diagnosed earlier this month at walter reed us army medical 
center in washington where president bushs physician arranged for 
her to be examined said miroslav chrobok embassy charge 
daffaires 
two doctors at walter reed suggested it might be one of those 
funny cases of leukemia we have in eastern europe it might be a 
chernobyl thing chrobok said 
he said the army doctors told him they meant cases of the 
sometimesfatal blood disease that have appeared with no apparent 
cause of leukemia except exposure to air or water contaminated by 
radiation over a wide region of europe and scandinavia after the 
april 1986 nuclear power plant explosion at the ukrainian city of 
chernobyl 
certainly there is nothing certain about the cause its 
just a possibility chrobok said 
at least 31 people perished during and after the chernobyl 
explosion and thousands were evacuated from the area of heaviest 
contamination since then numerous cases of bloodrelated 
illnesses around europe have been attributed to chernobyl and 
officials are urging a wider evacuation 
dr robert gale the los angeles physician who treated some of 
chernobyls worst radiation cases has said chernobyl fallout could 
increase cancer deaths by as many as 30000 worldwide in the next 
half century chrobok said gale is among numerous wellwishers who 
have messaged the ambassador and has offered to assist on her case 
dr klimova a newcomer to diplomacy arrived in washington last 
february as her countrys first new envoy to the united states 
after the peaceful revolution that ended 40 years of communist rule 
last december

a house armed services subcommittee is paring 
more than 5 billion from the pentagons budget by continuing a 
hiring freeze for civilians and slashing maintenance funds for 
overseas bases congressional sources say 
the panel on readiness cut force structure support costs by 59 
billion from president bushs original proposal of 793 billion to 
meet levels set under a house budget resolution approved on may 1 
fridays action came in advance of tuesdays session of the full 
house armed services committee which is expected to craft a 1991 
military budget of 283 billion 24 billion less than president 
bush sought in january 
the lawmakers approved a 109 billion reduction in pay for the 
pentagons civilian work force which currently numbers around 1 
million people 
they also approved continuing the hiring freeze that was 
introduced earlier this year by defense secretary dick cheney as 
a means of reducing the civilian work force said the

the government has rewritten a slice of 
economic history reporting that the total economy grew at a slower 
pace last year than previously thought 
the commerce department said friday the gross national product 
the nations broadest measure of economic health grew by 25 
percent in 1989 instead of the 3 percent growth rate estimated 
earlier 
that put growth at its slowest pace since the recession year of 
1982 when the gnp actually shrank by 25 percent 
government statisticians blamed the error on mistakes made in 
estimating wages and salaries which were overstated by 579 
billion for 1989 
the correction changed not only the governments economic 
estimates but also its forecast for tax revenues over the next 
several years the office of management and budget was forced to 
slash its estimate for tax revenues by 1955 billion over the next 
five years 
the drop in expected tax revenues along with the weaker economic 
growth were two major factors forcing president bush to reverse his 
stand on taxes as part of negotiations with congress to come up 
with an acceptable deficit reduction plan 
while the commerce departments initial assessment of wages is 
based on a partial sample of businesses the july update takes into 
account more complete data gathered from the countrys roughly 6 
million businesses

a department of health and human services 
advisory panel recommended removing social security from the 
calculation of deficit reduction targets to focus public attention 
on the ballooning deficit 
the advisory council on social security also recommended friday 
continuing the payroll tax rate at the current level to build 
reserves as a cushion for the retirement of 75 million baby 
boomers which will begin around 2010 
the council said in its interim report that maintaining a strong 
social security system depends on having a healthy growing economy 
and that large deficits in the federal budget weaken the economy 
the council believes that the growing social security reserves 
should not routinely be used simply to offset large operating 
deficits in the rest of the federal budget the panel said 
the panels report said the financial soundness of the social 
security trust funds is not affected by whether the trust funds are 
included or excluded in calculating deficit reduction targets 
but taking social security out of the grammrudmanhollings 
calculations will help federal policymakers and the american 
people focus on the fundamental importance of reducing the deficit 
and moving toward a surplus in the overall federal budget the 
council said 
the council also opposed changing the social security programs 
financing to a payasyougo system in which payroll taxes 
would be set at a rate sufficient to raise enough revenues to cover 
current expenses and maintain a contingency reserve

gun enthusiasts made good on their threat 
to take gov jim florio to court over his statewide ban on 
militarystyle assault weapons 
the national rifle association the coalition of new jersey 
sportsmen and the congress of racial equality filed a federal 
lawsuit friday seeking a temporary restraining order against the 
law signed by florio in may 
the law bans the sale and severely curtails the possession of a 
wide range of semiautomatic weapons in new jersey 
california is the only other state to ban assault weapons 
supporters of the new jersey bill call the new jersey ban tougher 
because it does not exempt current owners of the weapons 
the groups hope to obtain a court hearing date next week said 
ira mallowe treasurer of the coalition of new jersey sportsmen 
the lawsuit takes aim at two provisions in the law one 
restricting possession of certain gun magazines the part of the 
gun where ammunition is stored and the other banning air guns and 
bb guns 
the law specifically prohibits individuals from possessing 
magazines capable of holding more than 15 rounds of ammunition but 
it also prohibits disposing of those magazines said richard 
manning the nras new jersey liaison 
mallowe said gun owners were made instant felons with no way 
to cure the problem 
the lawsuit also said the state ban preempted federal law 
which allows ownership of air guns and bb guns 
under the law current gun owners have one year either to sell 
their guns outofstate or turn them over to police collectors can 
keep their weapons if the guns are rendered inoperable by the 
removal of firing pins or bolts 
gun owners can also register their guns if they join a target 
shooting club within seven months but only if the guns are models 
sanctioned for use in us army shooting competitions 
those arrested for illegal possession of the firearms face three 
to five years in prison and a fine of up to 7500 using an 
assault weapon in a crime can bring up to 20 years

the bush administrations plan to raise 
money by limiting deductions on local taxes could cripple the 
ability of hightax states to run schools and provide services 
opponents say 
taxpayers would be limited to a 10000 deduction for state and 
local income taxes under the plan which is supported by republican 
congressional leaders 
state officials feared the plan also might drive residents from 
hightax states to ones where income taxes are lower or 
nonexistent 
if the state loses its income tax which it relies on then 
you have to use the other taxes gov mario cuomo said friday 
or would you stop feeding the poor people cuomo a democrat 
was a key player in the successful 1985 fight to save deductibility 
i dont think it helps the states at a time when the federal 
government is bailing out of responsibilities said new jersey 
gov jim florio 
cuomo and other officials say a loss of deductibility would put 
pressure on them to reduce state and local income taxes at a time 
when they are already hurting for tax revenue 
a loss of deductibility would magnify every state and local 
income tax increase for upperincome taxpayers because they would 
lose the ability to deduct those taxes on their federal returns 
that say critics of the plan amounts to double taxation 
edward farrell executive director of the new york state 
conference of mayors said the practical effect would be states and 
localities turning to more regressive taxes such as sales or 
property taxes 
but those taxes are harder to increase largely because of the 
potential for taxpayer revolts that means towns and cities might 
be forced to sacrifice police firefighters or other services he 
said 
poor school districts in new york which rely heavily on state 
income tax revenue would find it impossible to maintain their 
education predicted board of regents chancellor martin barell 
restrictions also could encourage residents of hightax states 
to move thus decreasing the tax base said chris zimmerman chief 
economist at the national conference of state legislatures 
a rich person in new york would get hit but a rich person in 
texas wouldnt he said people dont migrate to canada or 
mexico because the tax rate went up but they might go to 
connecticut 
connecticut has no income tax and texas has no state income tax 
but some local income tax

the peasants came out slowly 
from behind the cementblock barricade making sure the approaching 
strangers werent sandinistas trying to force them off the 
collective farm they took over 
they were shooting automatic weapons into the air all night 
long we couldnt sleep said edwin velazquez apologizing for 
the cool greeting 
the antisandinista peasants in la concepcion and other areas of 
nicaragua share similar complaints about the conservative 
government of president violeta barrios de chamorro which replaced 
the leftist sandinistas in april 
the peasants say the new government has not responded quickly 
enough to demands for land distribution and that it is afraid to 
press ahead decisively with handing out stateowned lands because 
of a possible violent sandinista reaction 
but this years planting season is halfway over and some 
peasants have taken matters into their own hands 
on july 13 velazquez and two dozen peasants armed with machetes 
walked onto the 62acre sandinista collective farm and took it over 
they didnt meet much resistance the farmers of the gaspar 
garcia laviana collective live in another area and only the 
caretaker was present 
a week later a second group of peasants took over another 
sandinista cooperative near la concepcion a third cooperative 
farther away had been taken over in early july 
the peasants impatience is shared by large landowners such as 
ramiro gurdian president of the nicaraguan union of agricultural 
and cattle producers 
many feel the sandinistas although voted out of office in 
february still call the shots 
gurdian said a perception that mrs chamorros government is not 
firm enough has scared away investment especially in agriculture 
a cotton grower gurdian said that only half of 250000 acres 
destined for cotton this year will be planted with the export crop 
were going to lose 30 million in export earnings we had 
been counting on and thats just in cotton gurdian said 
the government is trying to change its image as timid and 
fearful of crossing the sandinistas 
minister of the presidency antonio lacayo soninlaw of 
president violeta barrios de chamorro recently went on television 
to touch on comments heard often lately 
lacayo considered the real power behind his motherinlaws 
presidency denied there was a secret pact with the sandinistas 
and defended the governments cautious attitude 
this is very difficult because this is a very polarized 
society he said adding that the governments policy is simply 
to impose dialogue to resolve any crisis 
agrarian reform minister gustavo tablada said there has not been 
enough time in the three months since the new government took over 
to resolve the disposition of the 3500 cooperatives nationwide 
he said he failed to understand the land takeovers in la 
concepcion 
the thing here is to have a lot of patience so as not to make 
mistakes that later will have negative effects we have to use 
persuasion tablada said 
velazquez however is not waiting for the government to act 
with the other men looking on and nodding velazquez said most 
of the peasants occupying the farm do not have enough land he said 
the sandinistas had abandoned the cooperatives and own additional 
land elsewhere while he and his neighbors had been forced to plow 
plots too small for survival 
velazquez said his group had filed written requests for land 
with the agrarian reform offices in the cities of masaya and 
granada at least two hours drive away 
we have never gotten a reply thats when we decided to do 
this he said maybe these actions are illegal but through 
pressure we can achieve something 
the peasants have gone one step further they have sent word to 
the sandinista farmers to have a parley and settle the dispute 
they have land and we dont velazquez said they are 
peasants and so are we the government hasnt even sent anybody 
down to talk to us i think we can reach an agreement among us 
all we want to do is work

the longest and costliest criminal case in 
us history ended when jurors deadlocked in raymond buckeys 
retrial on charges he molested three girls at mcmartin preschool 
the judge declared a mistrial and prosecutors said they would 
not try buckey a third time closing a case that began seven years 
ago amid initial allegations involving more than 100 children and 
suggestions of satanism and animal torture the case prompted 
national concern over molestation 
i think there is reason to say enough at this point 
district attorney ira reiner said after superior court judge 
stanley weisberg declared a mistrial friday 
there has been a mighty effort and there is no verdict 
reiner said 
the judge set a hearing for wednesday to dismiss charges against 
buckey 32 who spent five years in jail the case cost los angeles 
county more than 135 million 
we gave it our best shot said the trial prosecutor deputy 
district attorney joseph martinez 
these kids cannot be mcmartin kids for the rest of their 
lives its been a horrible experience martinez said 
buckey said he believed it had been a witch hunt from the 
outset it was salem revisited he said it was mccarthyism 
one more time 
ive gone from probably one of the most hated people you could 
ever mention he said to a point of where everybody that 
comes up to me now is very sympathetic and theyre saying i 
always thought you were innocent 
the saga began in august 1983 when a mother reported to police 
that her young son had been molested at the prestigious manhattan 
beach preschool 
hysteria followed after police asked parents to check their 
children for signs of molestation hundreds of parents reported 
their children were victims and tots were rushed to therapy center 
for interviews therapists decided more than 100 probably had been 
molested 
children gave investigators accounts of naked games satanic 
rites and animals tortured to frighten the youngsters into silence 
seven defendants were arrested and charged with molestation 
buckey the only male his mother sister and aged grandmother 
along with three other women teachers 
reiner dismissed charges against all defendants except buckey 
and his 63yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey for lack of 
evidence after an 18month preliminary hearing the buckeys were 
accused of molesting 11 children during a fiveyear period 
after a trial lasting nearly three years a jury in january 
cleared mrs buckey of 12 charges and absolved her son of 40 
charges but deadlocked on 13 counts against him reiner decided to 
retry buckey on eight counts involving three girls 
jurors who spent three months hearing evidence in the retrial 
and three weeks deliberating said they believed no jury would ever 
agree on buckeys guilt or innocence 
the girls now adolescents testified about dim recollections of 
events alleged to have happened as long as 10 years ago when they 
were toddlers 
the panelists divided their votes differently on the eight 
counts seven times leaning toward acquittal the splits ranged 
from 66 to 111 
i dont think that you can get 12 people to reach a verdict in 
this case said juror lloyd isaacson 
several jurors said the prosecutions least effective evidence 
was a series of videotapes made by childrens institute 
international in which therapists interviewed toddlers about 
whether they were molested 
isaacson said he believed the children made claims they were 
molested only after being told that their friends had revealed 
yucky secrets and were urged by therapists to do the same 
i feel a child is just going to go along with the adult to say 
what they want them to say he said 
reiner said because parents wanted to resolve the case he did 
not regret retrying buckey 
defense lawyer danny davis asked if the parents would ever 
accept buckeys innocence said i dont think they can 
buckey said he wouldnt start making plans for the future until 
charges are officially dismissed but he said with a smile ill 
have to get a job now

oil analysts predict crude prices and the cost of 
gasoline will rise later this year as a result of the opec 
agreement to curb output 
pricedepressing overproduction by kuwait and the united arab 
emirates is less likely after iraqi president saddam husseins 
intimidation campaign aimed at making the countries honor their 
opecset output quotas analysts said 
under the agreement reached friday by the 13 ministers of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries gasoline prices are 
expected to rise up to 10 cents a gallon by december 
the opec members agreed on a new overall production cap of 225 
million barrels a day through the rest of the year the figure is 
400000 barrels above the previous ceiling but will require opec to 
cut its actual production currently estimated at 23 million 
barrels a day or more 
the ministers also agreed at their twoday meeting to raise 
their minimum target price to 21 a barrel from 18 for a basket 
of crudes monitored by opec because of an oil glut the actual 
price recently has been about 1625 per barrel 
these agreements are a display of the complete unity of opec 
which are unprecedented in the recent history of the 
organization said iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
prices of energy futures settled slightly lower after initially 
rising on news of the opec pact some traders blamed technical 
factors and profittaking from a price increase in anticipation of 
the opec meeting 
if members dont cheat on their allocated quotas analysts said 
opec could reach its price by the end of the year when the 
northern hemisphere winter will push up oil demand 
nauman barakat an energy specialist at shearson lehman hutton 
in new york predicted the accords bite will be felt in the fall 
it wont do anything for the market in august and september 
but i think in the fourth quarter if demand is 244 million 
barrels a day for opec oil as the cartel is saying and theyre 
going to be producing at 225 theyll be drawing nearly 2 million 
barrels out of the market 
that could make the fourth quarter especially the tail end of 
the year very strong 
at the gasoline pump he predicted an increase of at least 6 
cents or even more say a dime by the end of the year 
paul mlotok head of energy research at the new york investment 
firm morgan stanley said opec could get close to its target price 
assuming they stick closely to their quota levels 
he said this could add about 5 cents a gallon to gasoline prices 
by december 
michael s rothman energy analyst at merrill lynch capital 
markets said fridays accord sent an unexpectedly strong signal 
the agreement is more bullish than what weve been looking 
for he said 
opec had not changed its benchmark price since december 1986 
the increase signaled the oncedominant groups resolve to regain 
more influence over world prices and it bore the stamp of iraq 
producing above quota means more revenue for the country 
involved but it undermines efforts to keep prices high 
that problem was behind saddam husseins recent belligerence and 
his call before the opec meeting for a 25 benchmark widely 
considered a bargaining tactic rather than a real goal 
the iraqi leader last week threatened to use military force 
against overproducing opec members saying their policies were 
forcing down prices and cost his warravaged economy billions of 
dollars in oil revenues 
iraq said kuwait and the united arab emirates were largely 
responsible for the current oil glut and iraq reportedly massed 
30000 troops along the kuwaiti border before the opec meeting 
while diplomats say the forces are being withdrawn baghdad has 
vowed to press claims over oil production and land in proposed 
talks with kuwait 
opec efforts to prevent cheating on quotas via a special 
committee have not helped much analysts say that may change now 
we do have a monitoring committee but with a membership of 
one saddam hussein barakat said 
theres likely to be better production discipline due to the 
political developments in the gulf rothman said 
algerian oil minister sadek boussena opecs newly elected 
president opened the meeting thursday with an appeal for halting 
overproduction 
he said low prices threatened to bring opec countries to the 
brink of economic collapse 
while other members may not agree with iraqs methods they 
privately welcome moves to stop cheating barakat said 
they were totally perplexed how they could make uae and the 
kuwaitis stick to their quotas he said there is certainly a 
lot of sympathy for iraq trying to force the cheaters to come back 
into the fold

roseanne barr admits she cant 
carry a tune but refused to apologize for a caterwauling version of 
the national anthem sung before booing baseball fans 
even president bush showed his displeasure friday 
im sorry i didnt sing so good the star of the toprated 
abctv comedy roseanne said of her screeching rendition 
wednesday night before 30000 fans attending a doubleheader in san 
diegos jack murphy stadium 
what else do i have to say i figured everybody knew i wasnt 
the worlds greatest singer 
barr said she nearly left the field in midsong as fans of the 
san diego padres and the cincinnati reds bombarded her with boos 
to top it off it was working womans night at the ballpark 
barr whose show chronicles the triumphs and struggles of a blue 
collar wife and mother with three kids denied she was 
disrespectful 
i represent a certain part of america that probably nobody 
else represents she said and i came out of someplace and got 
someplace and ive got a right to sing the song 
she recalled how in the first few notes of the starspangled 
banner she knew things were going wrong 
then everybody started booing me and i went into this panic 
thing she said at a raucous news conference friday at the 
beverly hilton hotel it took all the guts ive got in my life to 
finish singing 
more than 2000 phone calls about the unmelodious performance 
had come into the padres switchboard by midday friday 
barr said she had the best of intentions she refused to 
apologize although she used the word sorry several times 
im not going to apologize for doing it she said but not 
anybody anticipated that it would be this negative 
she capped her solo by grabbing her crotch and spitting 
actions she described as a parody of a baseball player not a 
response to the boos 
i probably should have waited a while before i scratched 
myself and spit she said but i wanted to get out of there 
the news conference became as chaotic as her tv family on 
roseanne when her husband tom arnold ordered police to eject 
a tabloid photographer 
photographer kip rano of american photo syndicate was led from a 
meeting room of the hotel after police warned he would be 
handcuffed and arrested if he refused to leave 
in a hollywood twist rano was escorted out by police officer 
paul kramer the same motorcyclist who arrested and was slapped by 
actress zsa zsa gabor last year 
barr said she had rano expelled because im not going to talk 
to the tabloids im suing them 
rano said his firm sells photos to everyone including 
tabloid newspapers he called the expulsion a publicity stunt by 
arnold and barr 
barr said her planned lawsuit against the national enquirer 
would not be filed until next week 
president bush joined a chorus of boos for barrs rendition of 
the anthem 
it was disgraceful bush said while flying to kennebunkport 
maine for the weekend thats the way i feel about it and i 
think a lot of san diego fans said the same thing 
told of bushs comment barr replied im sorry i didnt sing 
so good id like to hear him sing it

lawmakers maneuvered to override gov 
buddy roemers second veto in a month of legislation that would 
have made louisiana the toughest antiabortion state 
where i stand now reflects the majority of the people of this 
state roemer said that does not mean it reflects the majority 
of the legislature thats to be determined and thats fair 
the bill roemer vetoed friday would have prohibited abortions 
except to save the life of the mother and in cases of aggravated 
rape and incest reported to police and a physician no more than a 
week after they occurred 
on july 6 roemer vetoed an even tougher bill lacking the 
exceptions for rape and incest twothirds majorities in both 
legislative chambers are required to override a veto an override 
of the earlier veto passed the house but fell three votes short in 
the senate 
no louisiana governors veto has been overriden this century 
now the 144 state legislators will be sent ballots next week to 
determine if they want to call a special override session in august 
we ask every woman and man to stand with the governor to urge 
the legislature not to come back said teri bartlett director of 
planned parenthood of louisiana enough is enough this bill has 
embarrassed our state terrorized our women and families 
rep woody jenkins a democrat who leads the antiabortion 
group said he would try again to override roemers july 6 veto 
the measure vetoed friday was thrown together by the legislature 
which has only three women members the day before its regular 
session ended july 9 
roemer said the bill was insensitive to women 
it might serve us well legislators and governors who tend to 
be predominantly male to take time to listen to the viewpoint of 
women roemer said 
one of the most burdensome things about the bill that i vetoed 
today is that it did not listen at all roemer said 
roemer said rape is treated unevenly and unfairly and said 
only aggravated rape would be excepted under the bill it did not 
protect victims of simple rape defined in louisiana as sexual 
intercourse when a woman is incapable of resisting such as when 
she is drunk unconscious or afraid of the rapist 
its like simple rape was nonexistent it was like if a woman 
was mentally retarded she had no right and was fair game how 
insensitive can you be 
if the bill becomes law doctors who perform abortions could be 
sentenced to 10 years in prison and 100000 fines the bill was 
designed to challenge the us supreme courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that legalized abortion 
athough roemer declared he remained pro life 
antiabortionists branded him an abortionrights governor 
we are going to override this governor said sue fontenot a 
city council member in eunice and a member of louisianas right to 
life organization 
hes betrayed the prolife majority that elected him said 
nancy myers spokeswoman for the national right to life committee 
in washington hes using phony excuses to hide the fact that he 
doesnt care at all for unborn children 
abortionrights advocates said they were heartened 
governor roemers decision to veto the antiabortion bill was 
a rational and reasonable decision said joy gilmore president 
of the state chapter of the national organization for women

state officials called for federal cooperation if 
cubans decide to take seriously a remark by president fidel castro 
for the united states to accept another wave of refugees similar to 
the 1980 mariel boatlift 
we cannot tolerate another mariel there is no way the 
community can absorb it said dade county manager joaquin avino 
more than 120000 cubans fled to florida over a fivemonth period 
in 1980 
miami area leaders say they would need help in resettling 
refugees as well as federal controls on the numbers of visas to 
avoid another chaotic exodus 
one can hardly oppose the free emigration from cuba of people 
who are seeking freedom said miamis cubanborn mayor xavier 
suarez 
we need the usual safeguards and guarantees so we wouldnt get 
people from jails there should be a plan with people going to 
other parts of the country and not all people into one community 
asylumseekers packed the peruvian embassy in havana in 1980 
prompting the boatlift from the cuban port of mariel a ragtag 
armada of cubanamericans sailed across the florida straits 
believing they were picking up relatives friends and political 
prisoners but some were forced to return with convicted criminals 
and vagrants 
today most experts agree that fewer than 10 percent of the 
marielitos were criminals about 2600 are still in federal 
custody 173 were returned to cuba and an estimated 4000 are in 
various state and local prisons 
in a speech thursday on the 37th anniversary of the beginning of 
the cuban revolution castro invited the united states and other 
nations to issue entrance visas and send boats to pick up refugees 
in a sarcastic tone castro dared the yankees if they want 
to receive these poor persecuted citizens let them send the boats 
and the visas 
cuban exiles in miami said they believed the speech was solely 
intended to embarrass the united states 
fidel knows that the us is in no position to issue tens of 
thousands of visas what castro is trying to tell cubans is if 
you want to leave then leave but they dont want you there 
said tomas regalado news director at waqfam a spanishlanguage 
radio station 
under a 1984 agreement for orderly emigration cubans wishing to 
leave for the united states can go to the us diplomatic mission 
in havana and apply for visas last year 10046 cubans were 
allowed to come here as immigrants the immigration and 
naturalization service said 
ins spokesman verne jervis said the agency has a contingency 
plan for a marieltype refugee surge and a change in the cuban 
refugee flow might require a revision of the plan 
but at the moment there is no reason to believe a boatlift 
situation is imminent he said 
coast guard spokesman alastair worden said there were no reports 
friday of cubanamericans launching vessels to the island 
so far this year 216 cuban refugees have been found this year 
in boats and homemade vessels floating toward florida said 
worden last year 390 cubans were rescued by the coast guard

in bidding to make the hubble space telescope 
mirrors eastman kodak planned independent tests that could have 
detected before its launch the focusing flaw that now cripples the 
15 billion orbiting observatory a company official says 
eastman kodak planned to team with itel optical systems to make 
two primary mirrors for the space telescope according to documents 
released friday by nasa in response to a freedom of information 
petition 
the companies were to crosscheck the accuracy of their mirrors 
to assure they were of the correct prescription and then one of the 
mirrors would be used on the telescope 
nasa officials however awarded the contract in 1977 to 
perkinelmer the danbury conn firm now known as hughes danbury 
optical systems ground the mirrors itself and used its own 
personnel and equipment to check the mirror prescriptions 
perkinelmers winning bid was 6428 million kodaks proposal 
was for 9979 million through overruns and delays the cost of 
the perkinelmer contract climbed to an eventual total of 451 
million 
the hubble space telescope was launched in april and has been 
found to have a focusing flaw in either the primary or secondary 
mirror this error nasa officials have said means the telescope 
is now able to capture images that are only about half as clear as 
those planned 
dick wollensak a vice president of itek which is now a 
subsidiary of litton industries said that the losing kodakitek 
bid called for a socalled endtoend test that would have 
detected any flaw in the mirrors before the telescope was launched 
we werent going to build those things and then not test them 
after they were assembled he said in a telephone interview 
between kodak and itek there were facilities to test the 
assembled optical system without a major modification 
nasa officials have said that the completed perkinelmer optical 
assembly was not tested because it would have required a test 
facility that may have cost more than 100 million as a result 
the telescope was launched into space without ever being optically 
tested as an assembled unit the focusing error was not discovered 
until the telescope was in orbit 
wollensak said the perkinelmer design did not allow for the 
primary mirror to be tested after it was placed into the assembled 
telescope he said the instrument was designed to work in zero 
gravity and the gravity of earth caused the glass to sag slightly 
which would have changed the focus 
kodak and itel however had developed a way to prevent the sag 
and thus test the mirrors as an assembled unit wollensak said 
wollensak said he believes cost was a major factor in nasa 
selectinig perkinelmer to make the hubble optics 
nasa had developed their own version of what it should cost 
and that was lower than the itekkodak bid wollensak said 
they felt that the perkinelmer bid was low but they though that 
the difference between the nasa expectation and the perkinelmer 
bid would cover the overrun 
as it turned out the final actual cost was seven times more 
than the perkinelmer bid wollensak said the kodakitel bid would 
have avoided many of the problems that led to the perkinelmer 
overruns 
a nasa committee investigating the flawed hubble telescope plans 
to return to perkinelmers plan in danbury on aug 15 for two more 
days of testimony and a review of documents and equipment related 
to the flawed optics 
the committee met for two days this week in danbury and an 
engineer who was there said it may take weeks to find the precise 
mistake that caused the flawed focus 
the engineer who asked for anonymity said the investigation is 
like looking for a bookkeeping error it will go on and on

president bush says hes pleased 
with the initial reaction his supreme court nominee has received 
from senators and says new hampshire jurist david souter seems to 
have broad support for the post 
at the same time the president said he has no comment on highly 
critical comments of both him and souter by justice thurgood m 
marshall 
i have a very high regard for separation of powers and for the 
supreme court and thus i think people can get along without a 
comment from me on this interview bush told reporters aboard air 
force one on friday 
attorney general dick thornburgh however told a boston news 
conference he was saddened by marhsalls remarks 
i believe it is the first time any sitting supreme court 
justice has ever in our history criticized an appointment and 
indeed criticized the president who made the appointment 
thornburgh said 
i dont believe that is a constructive attitude to have on the 
eve of consideration by the senate of the nomination of a man 
possessed by extraordinary qualitites of intellect integrity and 
character 
the president is spending the weekend at his oceanside family 
vacation home 
marshall said in a television interview on thursday that he had 
never heard of bushs nominee and believed some one else should 
have been given the appointment 
in the interview on abctv marshall also said he considered 
bush to be dead and that chief of staff john sununu was 
calling the shots 
souter whom sununu appointed to the new hampshire supreme court 
when sununu was governor in the 1980s hitched a ride on air force 
one on friday 
he and bush parted at pease air force base in portsmouth nh 
souter was expected to spend the weekend at his home in weare 
nh and return to washington on monday 
souter who has a reputation as a man of a few words wandered 
back to the press section of air force one by himself at one point 
and said i dont want to ruin my reputation i have two things 
to say hi and goodbye 
bush said its hard to gauge how the senate will vote because 
a lot have not expressed their views 
but he said he had received upbeat assessments on souters 
chances from sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking republican on 
the senate judiciary committee and from sen warren rudman 
rnh who is souters chief senate sponsor 
bush conceded that souters position on many issues was unknown 
but he said i think hes not the most wellknown figure in the 
country but thats not why i selected him so hell be plenty 
wellknown when he gets testifying and gets through this process 
which i think hell do with flying colors 
bush said that although he had not sought souters views on 
controversial subjects like abortion he had not agreed to a 
condition against grilling the nominee on such issues 
no nothing on my side on that he said 
rudman who was also aboard air force one had said souter had 
told him he did not want to come to washington if it meant that the 
president or others in the administration would ask him questions 
on potential decisions 
rudman said he had relayed the concern to sununu who had told 
him that is not our policy rudman said he then passed along 
those reassurances to souter 
the taciturn souter has been in a state of near shock for 
the past few days but has come out of it rudman told reporters on 
air force one 
meanwhile bush who has championed a constitutional amendment 
to prohibit flag desecration said that he was unhappy by the 
rendition given to the national anthem earlier this week at a 
baseball game in san diego by comedienne roseanne barr 
my reaction is it was disgraceful thats the way i feel 
about it and i think a lot of the san diego fans said the same 
thing 
asked if he would stop watching her television show bush said 
what show 
asked if she would not receive an invitation to the white house 
the president said theres no change of plans in that 
bush managed to get in 18 holes of golf on friday after 
arriving he planned to go boating today then to attend the 
wedding here of a distant relative 
he returns to washington late sunday with no public events 
scheduled

us secretary of state james a baker 
and southeast asian nations were at odds today over whether 
communist khmer rouge guerrillas should be included in a cambodian 
transitional government 
if we are serious about the objective of cambodian 
selfdetermination we need to urge the formation of a supreme 
national council and the holding of unorganized elections 
baker said 
that impetus can come from offering new diplomatic incentives 
and from showing no tolerance for the khmer rouges dialogue of 
death he said at the annual meeting of the association of 
southeast asian nations or asean 
the khmer rouge known for their brutal rule of cambodia from 
197578 are militarily the strongest rebel group fighting an 
11yearold war against the vietnamesebacked communist government 
in phnom penh two other rebel groups are noncommunist 
asean comprises thailand malaysia singapore indonesia brunei 
and indonesia they scheduled a series of meetings today in their 
annual dialogue with major trading partners the united states 
japan australia canada new zealand and the european community 
the association holds that a cambodian national council would 
have to include all shades of political opinion including the 
khmer rouge 
baker announced last week that the united states would withdraw 
recognition of the united nations seat held by the threemember 
cambodia resistance coalition because it includes the khmer rouge 
the group is blamed for hundreds of thousands of deaths when it 
ruled cambodia from 197578 and now threatens a military comeback 
baker said washington would open talks with vietnam and possibly 
phnom penh itself to try to end the fighting 
asean wants the cambodian guerrilla coalition to form the 
council which would occupy the un seat at the next session of 
the general assembly 
the association expects former head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk to play a key role his noncommunist followers plus 
anticommunists under former premier son sann make up the weaker 
portion of the coalition 
sihanouk issued a statement from pyongyang north korea this 
week that said there would be no peace in cambodia unless the khmer 
rouge were allowed to participate in a political settlement on an 
equal footing with other warring factions 
a series of inconclusive peace talks since 1988 sponsored by 
asean has included the representatives of the khmer rouge 
sihanouk son sann and premier hun sens phnom penh government 
as envisioned by asean the supreme council would be headed by 
sihanouk and serve as a repository for cambodian sovereignty until 
free elections could be held under un auspices 
in other developments at the asean meeting 
baker on friday said the united states had done its share in 
helping indochinese refugees and that criticism of us policy was 
unfair 
the asean has criticized the united states and vietnam for 
opposing the compulsory return of people who do not qualify as 
political refugees and at the same time not providing alternate 
solutions baker countered that since 1975 the united states has 
resettled 900000 of 17 million southeast asian refugees and taken 
120000 more from vietnam alone 
a senior us state department official said the sultanate of 
brunei has joined singapore in offering american armed forces 
access to its territory 
singapore and washington are negotiating an arrangement for 
increased use by us warships and planes of the islands 
facilities 
brunei is also prepared for an enhanced security 
relationship said the us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the oilrich sultanate on the north coast of borneo is expanding 
its navy with new patrol boats and buying its first fixedwing 
combat aircraft 16 britishbuilt hawks

richard secord and a cargo carrier once owned by 
the cia took pains to hide their involvement in the illegal supply 
of arms to the nicaraguan contras during the mid1980s according 
to testimony at a federal trial 
the family of william sawyer jr and eugene hasenfus sole 
survivor of a october 1986 crash in nicaragua claimed friday that 
secord and southern air transport misrepresented the supply mission 
and skimped on safety equipment 
sawyer died when the sandinistas shot down the c123 cargo plane 
as it ferried supplies to the usbacked rebels the incident 
helped unravel the irancontra affair 
in the trial of a federal damage lawsuit attorneys for hasenfus 
and the sawyer family are seeking a preliminary estimate of 34 
million including expenses caused by the crash and lost income 
secord a retired air force general who pleaded guilty to lying 
to congress about irancontra and the miamibased airliner deny 
they were legally responsible for hasenfus and sawyer they also 
contend that the men knew the risks they were taking 
richard gadd who helped national security council aide oliver 
north secord and southern air set up the operation said in 
written testimony friday that the use of corporate air services and 
other companies was designed to hide who was behind the supply 
effort 
southern air was once owned by the cia and continued to do 
contract work for the us government gadd said 
gadd and southern air president william langton decided the 
effort should be treated as a clandestine or covert activity so 
the media could not attempt to trace it back to the owners and the 
united states government the deposition said 
gadd said secord directed the funds and made policy decisions in 
the enterprise a major point for hasenfus who is trying to prove 
that secord was his real employer 
in another development gadd referred to comments by langton 
that former cia agent felix rodriguez had advised thenvice 
president george bush of problems with the supply effort rodriguez 
helped run the contra supply operation out of el salvador 
rodriguez testified friday about equipment problems with the 
planes especially in early 1986 in june 1986 he brought north a 
letter from crewmen complaining their navigational equipment was 
inadequate 
over the strong objections of southern air attorneys rodriguez 
testified that the only radar detection devices aboard were radio 
shack fuzz busters designed to allow drivers to spot police 
patrol cars on the highway 
but rodriguez said that after he left the supply operation by 
september 1986 he understood that flights had increased and 
equipment had improved 
the former agent left the cia in 1976 and is credited with 
capturing cuban leader fidel castros close ally ernesto che 
guevara in bolivia he also was a veteran of the bay of pigs 
invasion in 1961

rebels fought in the streets of the 
capital with troops loyal to president samuel doe and one rebel 
leader claimed to have set up his own government 
doe through a spokesman maintained friday he would never 
resign as leader of this west african nation and predicted his 
troops would defeat the rebels within two weeks 
the spokesman who was not identified spoke in a radio 
telephone call to the british broadcasting corp in london 
later friday radio elwa outside monrovia broadcast a speech by 
rebel leader charles taylor in which he claimed to have established 
his own government no details were given in the speech from the 
missionary station which apparently had been taken over by 
taylors supporters 
in a similar uprising in 1985 rebels took over a liberian radio 
station and made a broadcast in which they claimed to have ousted 
doe the claim proved groundless 
in washington state department spokesman david denny said us 
officials were aware of taylors latest broadcast but that they had 
no indication the 7monthold civil war was over 
on the contrary fighting continues he said he declined 
comment on specifics of what taylor said 
troops loyal to taylor the national patriotic front president 
remained blocked by government troops in paynesville more than six 
miles from the city center 
the more than 300 rebels who invaded the center of monrovia by 
two bridges friday were supporters of rival rebel leader prince 
johnson 
they took control of streets on the banks of the mesurado river 
and told residents to leave by way of the captured bridges 
witnesses said hundreds heeded the order 
rebels have fought their way into the city on other occasions 
but either withdrew or were driven out 
this time some government soldiers were seen stripping off 
their uniforms throwing away their rifles and fleeing in civilian 
clothes as the rebels advanced 
more than 100 government troops were sent to the waterfront area 
and heavy fighting ensued 
battles also broke out in the diplomatic quarter of mamba point 
and government troops sent heavy artillery to a hill overlooking 
the city center close to dipolmatic missions 
meanwhile doe remained in the executive mansion in a lastditch 
attempt to prevent a takeover by rebels 
panicky soldiers carried out random arrests of civilians 
accusing them of supporting the rebels 
responding to witness accounts of a spate of tribal killings by 
government soldiers this week acting information minister paul 
allen wie said such kilings were not government policy 
a communique issued by five european community ambassadors in 
monrovia on thursday condemned the summary executions of 100 gio 
and mano tribesmen many of the rebels come from those ethnic 
groups 
the rebels also are accused of killing members of tribes that 
support doe 
does defense minister boimah barclay went to the john f 
kennedy hospital in the city where dozens of people were rounded 
up by soldiers wednesday and took action to prevent any further 
killing wie said 
the rebels who began their offensive in december accuse the 
government of corruption and human rights abuses 
at least 375000 liberians have fled the fighting into 
neighboring guinea ivory coast and sierra leone the office of the 
un high commissioner for refugees said in geneva the un 
appointed a special representative friday to coordinate relief 
operations

a high court judge has issued a temporary 
injunction banning a book that reportedly gives intimate details 
about britains royal family 
justice michael wright on friday banned author malcolm barker 
from publishing his book courting disaster anywhere in the 
world but stayed the ban until 430 monday afternoon pending an 
appeal 
the injunction also forbids barkers publisher fleetwood 
publications from selling the book in britain 
lawyers for barker and fleetwood publications said they will 
appeal the part of the court order that bans barker from publishing 
outside britain 
barker worked from 1980 to 1983 as a lowly storemanclerk to the 
master of the royal household at buckingham palace 
the book makes disclosures that lawyers for queen elizabeth ii 
claim breach a confidentiality agreement signed by barker when he 
joined the palace staff 
royal staff are required to sign agreements not to disclose 
details of what they see and hear while in royal service as a 
legally binding contractual condition of employment 
the injunction will remain in effect until the high court hears 
an action brought by the attorney general on behalf of the queen 
to permanently ban the book and to direct any profits from the book 
to the attorney general 
if barker who lives in the canadian province of nova scotia but 
is currently visiting britain disobeys the order he could be 
jailed and face heavy fines for contempt of court 
angered by behindthescenes disclosures by former employees 
the palace in recent years has increasingly reverted to legal 
action to suppress a succession of spicy memoirs 
courting disaster published by the novascotia based 
fleetwood publications is on sale in canada the united states and 
bermuda said barkers lawyer david fowell 
fowell said 20000 copies of the book had been printed and 
magazine serialization rights had been sold to australian american 
and french magazines 
lawyers for queen elizabeth on tuesday obtained an injunction 
against an eightpage excerpt of the book in the current edition of 
the french publication paris match the excerpt was removed from 
the 8000 copies of the magazine sold in britain

automakers bade farewell to the 
legendary citroen deux chevaux conceived by its french designer as 
a fourwheeled sofa covered by an umbrella 
the last car rolled off the factory line friday after 42 years 
in production and the finale took place in portugal where citroen 
moved production after shutting down its levallois assembly line 
near paris 
there were no public ceremonies at the mangualde factory just 
a little gettogether for the workers who have been making them 
said a citroen lusitania spokesman teixeira de abreu 
but citroen fans worldwide will mourn the demise of the 
turtleshaped deux chevaux named literally for two horses or 
the horsepower produced by its chugging aircooled engine 
it was officially designated the 2cv and came with openflap 
sidewindows mattresslike suspension and scrawny tires more than 
386 million were sold since the launch at the 1948 paris auto show 
for 650 
including a van more comfortable ami and dyane versions and 
even a fourwheel drive derivative more than 7 million deux 
chevaux have hit the roads thousands of fans have set up about 300 
owners clubs worldwide 
citroens hitech ax compact will substitute the 2cv at the 
mangualde plant but according to gavin green chief editor of 
britains car magazine no car will replace it theres no 
successor in sight its the end of an era 
he says most owners have an emotional relationship with their 
2cv that like the volkswagen beetle and the britishmade mini has 
become a motoring legend 
in 1935 citroen boss pierrejules boulanger asked his designers 
to dream up a small avantgarde car for all classes of folk that 
would be like a fourwheeled sofa covered by an umbrella 
boulanger demanded enough headroom for an operabound gentleman 
wearing a top hat but also a car supple enough to transport at 
least two peasants with a basket of eggs across a ploughed field 
without smashing their fragile cargo all that without using more 
than about 24 gallons of fuel for 60 miles 
the first wooden mockups had one headlamp a serrated hood that 
looked like a cheese grater functional interior appointments 
included a rollback canvas roof a handoperated windshield wiper 
and hammock seats 
when world war ii broke out in 1939 boulanger had all but one 
of the 250 running prototypes destroyed he hid the survivor in a 
barn 
available only in gray at the 1948 paris launch the deux 
chevaux could manage a top speed of 37 mph sales soon rocketed and 
in 1950 the waiting list was six years long 
sales began to slacken in the mid1980s the 2cv can no longer 
meet emission laws in switzerland and austria nor safety 
regulations in sweden and finland 
but green is convinced that life could have begun at 40 for the 
car that still has a loyal clientele in france britain west 
germany belgium and ireland 
sales are only dropping because citroen isnt advertising 
theres no genuine reason to kill the car i think theyre a bit 
embarrassed by it not fitting their hitech image

rebels captured the prime minister and his cabinet in a coup 
attempt has been fighting with the government for years 
most recently bakr has been involved in a dispute over medical 
supplies and pharmaceuticals reportedly donated by libya and 
prohibited by customs agents from entering the country 
one of the first things bakr did after taking the leaders 
captive was accuse the government of refusing to let him distribute 
free medicine to the poor people of trinidad and tobago 
members of his sect jamaat almuslimeen have long been 
perceived by many trinidadians as violent outlaws although they 
proclaim moralistic motives for their actions 
bakr in his mid40s founded jamaat almuslimeen arabic for 
group of moslems six years ago 
he has said he does not recognize mans laws but only the 
law of almighty allah 
on friday he said he understood the present suffering of the 
people and that prime minister arthur robinson had been 
overthrown by god 
god has removed him bakr said on government television 
no man including me has power he gave us victory over the 
prime minister 
bakr his 200 to 250 followers and their wives and children live 
on a commune in western portofspain 
in 1988 police raided the commune seizing weapons and 
ammunition and arresting 34 members of the sect on charges of 
larceny robbery illegal possession of weapons rape and murder 
bakr a former policeman said then his vigilantes were waging a 
war against the menace of cocaine 
on friday he said we will stop the incest robbery and 
drugs which there was no hope for the present regime to stop 
moslems make up 6 percent of the population of trinidad and 
tobago a former british colony just off the northeast coast of 
venezuela of the nations 13 million people about 40 percent are 
of african descent and the same proportion is of east indian 
descent 
most of the east indians are hindu most of the africans are 
roman catholic or protestant the nations small moslem population 
is mostly east indians with some africans but the black moslem 
population has grown since the black power movement began 20 years 
ago and bakrs sect is the largest among them

the presidents of the three baltic republics said 
today they will not join negotiations to rewrite the treaty that 
created the soviet union preferring instead to talk directly with 
moscow about obtaining independence 
on friday the three republics agreed to bypass the kremlin by 
signing political and economic treaties with the russian 
federation also on friday another soviet republic byleorussia 
declared its sovereignty 
taken together the three developments represent strong new 
challenges to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev he seeks a new 
treaty with all 15 soviet republics to transfer some powers from 
the central government to local authorities seeking more autonomy 
from moscow 
but today the presidents of lithuania latvia and estonia said 
they consider it impossible to participate in the rewriting of 
the treaty 
they said it would be best if negotiations with moscow 
were held on the basis of the threeplusone principle that 
is the three baltic states plus the soviet government 
the statement was signed by estonian president arnold ruutel 
latvian president anatoly gorbunov and vytautas landsbergis the 
president of lithuania which already plans talks with moscow about 
its independence 
on friday baltic leaders urgently called for talks with the 
republic of russia after meeting with its reformist president 
boris n yeltsin the meeting came during yeltsins vacation in the 
latvian beach resort of jurmala 
the presidents said the talks would be aimed at agreeing to 
treaties between each baltic state and russia on political 
legal economic scientific and technical cultural aspects of 
mutual relations on relations between nationalities and 
citizenship 
their statement carried by the estonian news service said the 
treaties should be ready to sign within six to eight weeks the 
interfax news agency quoted yeltsin as saying the first treaty must 
be ready to sign within 45 days 
tass reported early today that a latvian delegation would go to 
moscow the capital of both russia and the soviet union on monday 
to begin talks 
latvian sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
treaties would probably include russian recognition of the baltics 
independence 
yeltsin was quoted as telling latvian television he envisages 
the treaties as agreements between equal and sovereign states 
meanwhile byelorussia a republic that borders poland became 
the ninth republic to take steps to distance itself from moscow 
the republics parliament friday approved a declaration of 
sovereignty saying its laws take precedence over national laws and 
that the republic has the right to run its own armed forces tass 
reported 
russia the ukraine and uzbekistan have also declared their 
sovereignty and the ukraine claims the right to have its own armed 
forces the georgian parliament has condemned the republics 
annexation by the soviet union and called for negotiations on 
independence 
moldavias parliament this week codified its june declaration of

fierce fighting raged today between rival 
shiite moslem militias backed by syria and iran leaving at least 
16 combatants dead and 30 wounded police said 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said artillery clashes first broke out between the 
syrianbacked amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah or party 
of god at 330 am on the northwestern edge of iqlim altuffah 
the apple province 
he said by the afternoon fighting raged across an eightmile 
vshaped front in the disputed province 
the whole front is on fire the spokesman said he said at 
one point artillery shells were falling at the rate of 20 per 
minute 
the thud of exploding shells echoed across the region and could 
be heard in sidon a provincial capital 25 miles south of beirut 
hezbollah said an hour after the shelling started that amal 
fighters backed by guerrillas of palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat launched an attack on its positions in the 
village of kfar milki 
police said the fighting left at least 16 combatants dead and 30 
wounded 
kfar milki six miles southeast of sidon is a strategic hilltop 
village that hezbollah overran in a major attack across the apple 
province in january 
the police spokesman said the plo guerrillas sealed off the 
region west of kfar milki preventing policemen and reporters from 
watching the confrontation 
he said however that ambulances evacuated four dead 
palestinian guerrillas and took 23 wounded to hospitals in nearby 
sidon 
the palestinians are obviously involved in the fighting but 
we cant establish whether they are taking part in ground attacks 
or just participating in the shelling duel with hezbollah 
gunners the police spokesman said 
a force of about 1000 guerrillas drawn mainly from arafats 
mainstream fatah faction mans a narrow buffer separating amal and 
hezbollah positions in the disputed region 
the buffer extends from kfar milki at the regions northwestern 
edge to the village of arab saleem on the southwestern flank 
the palestinian deployment blocked hezbollahs advance west 
toward the mediterranean coast and south toward the main shiite 
cities 
a hezbollah statement issued in beirut said the amalpalestinian 
attack was crushed the attackers lost many casualties and 
withdrew west the statement said without further elaboration 
the police spokesman however said no changes in positions were 
reported 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said a hezbollah source 
stressed that its fighters were willing to accept a ceasefire to 
allow the red cross to evacuate casualties 
amal and hezbollah have been fighting on and off for more than 
three years for control of the 12 million shiites the largest 
sect in lebanon nearly 1200 people have died in the clashes and 
more than 4000 have been wounded 
amal calls the hezbollah attacks an iranian invasion 
charging that the 2000 iranian revolutionary guards contingent in 
lebanon was involved 
the command of the iranian contingent in a rare statement 
defended its role saying it was aimed only at fighting the 
zionists and defending the moslems 
the disputed area is adjacent to the selfdesignated security 
zone israel occupies in southern lebanon 
the iranian statement published by the leftist newspaper 
assafir called on amal and hezbollah to end the fighting among 
brethren and unite your guns against the zionist enemy 
the iranian guards came to lebanon in 1982 with the declared 
objective of taking part in confronting israels invading army 
they set up headquarters in the eastern lebanon town of baalbek and 
have since trained most of hezbollahs fighters

a breakaway branch of solidarity today 
formed a new party to rival the faction that backs lech walesa 
the new party the citizens movement for democratic action 
includes many heroes of solidaritys successful struggle against 
communist rule in the 1980s its founding congress today drew more 
than 1000 delegates from around the country organizers said they 
want the party to offer support to solidarity prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki who is frequently criticized by walesa 
a prowalesa party the center alliance was formed two months 
ago 
zbigniew bujak a solidarity leader during the years the 
movement was banned acknowledged the formation of the two parties 
reflects polarization within solidarity but he said that 
does not have to be bad 
a democratic country is a country of different proposals we 
will have to forget about the otherwise comfortable structure in 
which the picture was black and white just us against them 
he told the new partys members 
in its first political move the congress voted nearly 
unanimously to endorse a constitutional amendment mandating a 
popularly elected president 
currently the president is chosen by the two chambers of 
parliament 
the new partys members include many of walesas longtime 
advisers and allies in solidarity 
among them are adam michnik solidarity theoretician and 
editorinchief of gazeta wyborcza polands largest daily 
filmmaker andrzej wajda henryk wujec secretary of the solidarity 
parliamentary caucus andrzej wielowieyski deputy speaker of the 
senate government ministers aleksander hall jacek kuron and 
witold trzeciakowski and several deputy ministers 
fortytwo parliament deputies and senators have joined along 
with up to 5000 ordinary citizens who signed up nationwide 
we want to build a wide consensus of all those in favor of 
democracy we do not want to be leftwing or rightwing michnik 
told the group we want to get it together in our own new way 
the new party and the center alliance loyal to walesa clash on 
several key points 
the center alliance calls for electing walesa president by the 
current parliament this fall urges immediate privatization of the 
economy and the faster ouster of holdover communists from positions 
of authority 
it warns that the mazowiecki government should speed up 
political and economic reforms and emphasizes polish patriotism 
the new party wants early presidential elections but not by 
parliament arguing that the current chamber is tainted by the 1989 
political deal that set aside a portion of seats for communists 
it generally supports the policies of the mazowiecki government 
and says poland should move closer to europe and overcome 
backwardness

every morning natividad hancco 
ccama walks half an hour across brown sand to fill two buckets with 
dirty water 
mrs hancco steps carefully as she returns to her thatch house 
on a barren hill the daily ration of two buckets is all the water 
she and her two small children have for drinking cooking and 
bathing 
we live worse than animals she said holding her sons 
scabcovered hand sometimes i cry all day from anger 
until early this year trucks brought water to mrs hanccos 
house in a shantytown outside lima now with peru suffering its 
worst drought of the century the trucks are delivering water to 
richer neighborhoods that have gone dry 
most of limas 7 million people are affected even upperclass 
neighborhoods go entire days without water 
clothing dishes and food cannot be washed toilets are not 
flushed bathtubs are covered in dust 
the poor suffer most 
people are dying out here said dr rafael medina one of 
three doctors who care for the 22000 people living in or near cruz 
de motupe 
like the rest of the shantytowns dusty buildings medinas 
clinic has no electricity or telephone slogans scrawled in red 
paint by members of the maoist guerrilla group shining path cover 
its cinder block walls 
these people dont even have enough fuel to boil the water 
and the water is filthy medina said 
intestinal disease has risen 52 percent this year in cruz de 
motupe and similar increases had been recorded in limas many 
other shantytowns according to camelia pflacker a health ministry 
official 
peru already has one of the worlds worst rates of infant 
mortality 81 per 1000 mostly due to intestinal disease 
thousands of poor people recently marched through downtown lima 
to demand water 
water is a right and not a privilege many of their banners 
said 
the government says there is little it can do 
lima is in the middle of a desert and rain is rare most of the 
citys water comes from the rimac river which is fed by mountain 
streams and a drought in the southern andes has left the streams 
nearly dry 
according to the meteorological service the drought is caused 
by a change in the winds that usually bring moist sea air to the 
mountains 
decades of neglect of perus infrastructure make the situation 
worse not only has the water supply been cut in half the city 
water company said but 48 percent of that seeps into the ground or 
spills into the ocean through broken pipes 
other other basic services also have collapsed because of the 
drought 
limas power comes from five hydroelectric plants it is being 
rationed and the daily outages in turn affect the water companys 
ability to move water and operate wells 
reservoirs built to run the hydroelectric plants during the dry 
season now supply much of the capitals water 
an emergency welldigging program has helped but ground water 
levels are dropping rapidly 
the water company says many wells will go dry within a few 
months and the power company says its reservoirs hold only enough 
water to operate its plants until the next rainy season in 
november 
peru is poorly prepared to deal with the droughts effects it 
is in the grips of its worst economic crisis inflation exceeds 
3000 percent a year four of five people lack steady work and the 
government is bankrupt 
presidentelect alberto fujimori issued a plea for emergency 
food aid even before taking office saturday 
for now a few hundred water trucks must serve limas thirsty 
millions 
its not an easy job said santiago guttierez who is in 
charge of 100 trucks we have 250000 more people to bring water 
to than last year 
he pointed at a 30yearold ford its tank leaking from at least 
20 holes and added and we dont have the best equipment 
many residents of cruz de motupe complain about the men who 
drive the trucks 
they say the price is 35 cents for 20 gallons of water but the 
drivers often charge more the same amount of water delivered by 
pipe to an upperclass home costs a fraction of a cent 
we have no choice but to pay said rosalia diez who is 29 
and has four children at least my husband has a job some people 
just cant afford the water its really terrible 
yellow and red flowers bloom in front of the diez shack 
nourished by the family dishwater 
nelly gonzalez lives where the water trucks rarely go the 
plants in front of her house are dead she has seven children her 
husband makes shoes 
to have money and not to have water for the babies its 
absurd its tragic i hope the rains come soon because if they 
dont i think it means were not supposed to live

the july 16 earthquake has silenced 
president corazon aquinos opponents temporarily but sets the 
stage for deeper crises if her government is not effective in 
handling the recovery 
the quake which killed more than 1600 people also may affect 
the outcome of talks on the future of the six us military bases 
in the philippines the government relied heavily on us resources 
in the first critical hours 
some governments have turned disasters like this to their 
advantage a western diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
this could be an opportunity for them to show theyre a 
functioning government but it easily could turn into a real mess 
because of the earthquake mrs aquino appears to have gained a 
respite from political problems in congress and challenges both 
from marxist insurgents and military dissidents responsible for six 
coup attempts 
before the temblor the executive and legislative branches were 
heading for a collision over her establishment of a new political 
movement kabisig aimed at bypassing political parties 
congress set aside those differences and quickly approved 
administration requests for 440000 in emergency funds in turn 
the aquino administration accepted congressional demands that debt 
relief be sought from foreign creditors 
temporary unilateral truces were announced by the communist new 
peoples army and the dissident reform the armed forces movement 
relief operations appear to have improved but serious problems 
persist two weeks after the quake 
many foreign relief shipments were tied up in customs awaiting 
clearance and payment of duty reporters who visited affected areas 
said local officials delayed deliveries by repacking relief 
supplies in order to take credit for them 
under the best of conditions the philippines faces a massive 
recovery that by some estimates could take more than a decade 
bridges on major transport arteries collapsed more than 80000 
buildings were damaged or destroyed more than 110000 people were 
left homeless 
officials of the public works department says the commercial 
district of dagupan a city of more than 100000 needs to be 
relocated because it sank by about nine feet 
the emergency dramatized all theadministrative weaknesses for 
which mrs aquino has been criticized since taking office in the 
1986 people power revolution that ousted the late president 
ferdinand marcos 
filipino and foreign analysts question the governments ability 
to manage recovery and curb public discontent if the deficiencies 
are not corrected 
government rescuers did not reach some devastated areas of nueva 
vizcaya province until four days after the quake local officials 
found themselves trying to cope with a major disaster without 
cranes medicine transport or trained medics 
it was the private sector not the government that responded 
best immediately after the quake commercial radio stations alerted 
rescuers to areas of greatest need 
cadets of the philippine military academy carried out the first 
rescue operations in baguio where nearly 400 people were killed 
the cadets were helped by gold miners who heard radio reports of 
the devastation and walked miles over steep mountains to volunteer 
diplomatic sources said the government was slow in requesting 
foreign help a us rescue team was in the air from andrews air 
force base before a formal request for assistance was received 
richard gordon mayor of olongapo and a red cross official 
approached the us navy at subic bay for help gordon used a 
commercial radio station to coordinate aid with the mayor of 
cabanatuan where a school collapsed killing more than 130 people 
delays in asking for american help led to the suspicion that 
officials feared an active us role would pressure the government 
into extending the bases beyond the lease expiration in september 
1991 talks on a new agreement resume next month 
cardinal jaime l sin the roman catholic archbishop of manila 
and the nations most prominent cleric alluded to that in the 
comment 
how can we forget the shortsightedness of officials who 
tried to stop the americans from doing their humanitarian work 
because they were afraid the americans assistance would be tied up 
with the bases issue 
administration officials played down the us contribution after 
the quake and none attended the memorial for an american pilot 
killed when his aircraft crashed during relief operations 
us and philippine officials say the aid was not tied to the 
bases issue but it seems clear the american response will affect 
the talks 
for weeks american soldiers had been restricted to their bases 
for fear of attacks by communist rebels after the quake us 
military convoys drove through rebelcontrolled territory at night 
to reach affected areas 
american aid also underscored the philippines reliance on the 
bases during natural disasters the americans have the cranes 
helicopters search craft and other resources otherwise unavailable 
to a poor country 
the extensive and highly visible american aid makes a new 
treaty for the us bases a surer thing than ever before

more than 20 members of prime minister lothar 
de maizieres party in parliament once worked for the hated and 
nowdisbanded secret police two newspapers reported today 
a top party official said the reports were inaccurate 
the east berlin newspaper der morgen said 24 members of the 
christian democratic union faction in the parliament had formerly 
worked for the ministry of state security known in german as stasi 
the ministry which spied on all aspects of life in east 
germany was disbanded after east germanys communist regime fell 
since then many people have been accused of having worked in some 
capacity for the stasi 
the newspaper did not name the 24 christian democratic union 
members in question it said they received a letter from the 
faction chairman guenther krause in which he asked them not to 
take on any important political mandate in a future allgerman 
parliament 
a respected munichbased newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung 
carried a similar report today it didnt name the accused party 
members either 
east germanys christian democrats are the largest party in a 
coalition government the christian democrats govern in west 
germany led by chancellor helmut kohl the parties plan to merge 
before allgerman elections in december and the unified party is 
expected to do well in the balloting 
der morgen said the letter followed background checks on all 
parliamentarians for possible stasi connections the christian 
democrats have not commented on the reported reproach but many 
highranking party leaders confirmed the existence of the krause 
letter the newspaper said 
krause said the claims were not true 
he said there was no cause for such a letter and added that 
the reports may have been based on a misunderstanding prompted 
by another letter to faction members for unrelated talks

it wasnt long after theodore roosevelt named 
oliver wendell holmes to the supreme court that he wished he hadnt 
holmes cast an important vote against roosevelts trustbusting 
efforts 
i could carve out of a banana a judge with more backbone 
sputtered roosevelt 
maybe it is an omen that david h souter the appeals court 
judge from new hampshire selected last week by president bush for 
the supreme court is said to emulate the values and philosophy of 
holmes 
at harvard his senior thesis was on holmes judicial 
philosophy souter still follows a course of reading laid out by 
his fellow new englander 
over the years supreme court justices have shown an independent 
streak unforeseen by their presidential appointers 
the truth is that presidents can nominate justices but cant 
dominate them once on the bench jurists sometimes cause dismay 
for their sponsors 
dwight eisenhower regretted that hed named two justices who 
became liberal activists earl warren and william j brennan after 
leaving office ike was asked if he had made any substantial 
mistakes yes he is supposed to have said two and they are 
both sitting on the supreme court 
how was he to know when he appointed warren that his chief 
justice would lead the court into overthrowing segregation in 
public schools an earthquake of a decision and one that 
eisenhower never gave any sign of being happy about 
nor could ike have foreseen brennans forceful liberal impact 
brennan had been an obscure member of the new jersey supreme court 
eisenhower picked him because his first choice the chief justice 
of that court was too ill and recommended brennan instead 
nobody knows how a judge is likely to turn out until the judge 
actually sits on a bench said bernard schwartz a law professor 
at new york university and author of a new book about the warren 
burger court the ascent of pragmatism 
his best example of a justice who surprised his sponsor is felix 
frankfurter 
frankfurter he said was so radical he was almost considered 
a red when franklin d roosevelt appointed him 
once in robes frankfurter became a leader of the judicial 
restraint camp one of the nations leading civil libertarian 
lawyers turned into a thorn to libertarian causes 
of the eight justices on todays supreme court four byron 
white harry blackmun john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor 
turned out different than expected some more than others 
of the four blackmuns the shocker 
president richard nixon had been humiliated by the senate which 
rejected his first two nominees both conservative southerners 
on ethical grounds so he chose blackmun a littleknown appeals 
court justice 
blackmun was a lifelong friend of nixons ideologically 
predictable chief justice the solidly conservative warren e 
burger both were minnesotans 
for a time they marched in judicial lockstep wags called them 
the minnesota twins 
but the liberal brennan took blackmun under his tutelage and 
blackmun evolved into a moreoftenthannot liberal he wrote the 
roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion and once said with a 
sigh he supposed that was what theyd put on his gravestone 
white was nominated by president john f kennedy his close 
friend he pretty much has been a new frontiersman on civil 
rights said schwartz but on other issues he has trended away 
from the persuasion that got him his appointment 
mark tushnet a law professor at georgetown university 
dissented if we could ask john kennedy whether byron white has 
worked out as he expected i would guess the answer would be yes 
tushnet said 
stevens was appointed by president gerald r ford to take the 
seat of the foremost liberal william o douglas whom ford as a 
congressman had tried to have impeached stevens a court 
maverick has evolved into sharing the courts middletoliberal 
ground with blackmun 
oconnor is in the middletoconservative bloc with white she 
turned out to be much more of a centrist than reagans three other 
choices william rehnquist whom he elevated to chief justice and 
antonin scalia and anthony kennedy 
tushnet thinks justices surprise their nominating presidents 
only occasionally but lawrence marshall who teaches 
constitutional law at northwestern university said that in the 
past two or three decades a good third of appointees have 
disappointed their appointers with respect to major issues 
marshall has a theory presidents get surprised when they pick 
nominees on nonideological grounds 
when their agenda is ideology as it was when reagan picked 
scalia and rehnquist i think the surprises are a lot less 
frequent he said 
he cites oconnor and warren as examples reagan chose oconnor 
not for her ideology but because he had promised in his campaign to 
pick a woman eisenhower promised to name warren to the court at 
the republican convention in 1952 where warren then governor of 
california was competing with him for the presidential nomination 
there was something else going on other than an attempt by the 
president to choose ideologically said marshall 
what does that say about souters likelihood to surprise 
marshalls hunch is that bush deliberately did not scrutinize 
souter on ideological grounds opting for an unknown quantity and 
getting a nominee who on the court is capable of surprises

although not sitting at the bargaining table 
iraqi president saddam hussein wielded enormous influence over 
opecs decision to limit oil production and set its target price 
sharply higher 
indeed some believe it will be saddam and not opec who will 
make sure no one cheats on the new accord and forces prices down 
again 
hell be breathing down their neck said nauman barakat 
first vice president in the energy department at shearson lehman 
hutton in new york 
iraqs oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi denied his 
country would play the role of enforcer 
i have no police uniform he told reporters after fridays 
agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
later in an interview he said were not considering 
ourselves as a policeman nor as a watchdog 
but saddams strong words and even military threats against 
countries pumping too much oil did not go unnoticed 
midway through the meeting one minister said the conflict in 
the volatile persian gulf region was not hindering work 
on the contrary it has created a new atmosphere of 
willingness to work together said the official demanding 
anonymity 
people know now that deterioration within opec causes great 
harm to some countries he said its a serious matter 
another ministerial source also demanding anonymity said 
from now on every country must understand that any unilateral 
action to lower prices could affect the economic interests of the 
others 
at the end of two days of bargaining all 13 ministers signed an 
accord limiting their output to 225 million barrels a day for the 
rest of the year 
their current output is estimated at about 23 million barrels a 
day although it was much higher earlier in the year 
the ministers for the first time since december 1986 raised 
their target price pushing it up 3 to 21 a barrel 
if unlike in the past the cartel curtails output crude prices 
could rise several dollars a barrel by years end analysts said 
gasoline prices at the pump could go up as much as a dime a gallon 
saddams blast of rhetoric was aimed squarely at kuwait and the 
united arab emirates chronic and open violators of their opec 
supply quotas 
he blamed them for flooding the market with oil and depressing 
crude prices causing a 14 billion loss in revenue for iraq which 
is trying to rebuild from its costly eightyear war with iran 
chalabi said in the interview that the price decline opecs 
marker tumbled from 2046 in january to 1364 in june amounted 
to an oil shock for the producers 
we had to put an end to it he said we cannot just let 
anybody do whatever they like we had to defend ourselves and 
defend the interests of opec 
chalabi acknowledged that unfortunately we had to be a 
little bit hard on others 
in doing so iraq appeared to have nailed down pledges from 
kuwait and the uae to scale back output by hundreds of thousands 
of barrels a day 
we are all sure and confident that it is now the policy of the 
governments of kuwait and the uae to fully abide by the contents 
of the agreement said chalabi 
kuwait which has been pumping more than its supply quota of 15 
million barrels a day had argued lower prices would help the 
cartel hold on to its share of the world oil market 
the uae which has produced more than double its old quota of 
11 million barrels a day just accepted a cap of 15 million said 
another oil minister speaking on condition of anonymity 
all those factors are somehow linked to the political problems 
in the gulf he said 
but the iraqi presidents more bellicose words were frightening 
and unwelcome 
all the delegations were really worried about the outcome of 
this meeting said one minister 
there was concern he said that an outbreak of trouble in the

but he said there was never any mention of the confrontation in 
the formal sessions although there was some discussion in the

this west african city was once a 
lively capital a buzzing hive of business activity lebanese and 
indian traders mixed with american and european technicians in its 
oncebustling streets 
now those streets are deserted by civilians and are the 
battlegrounds of rebels and government troops 
crocodileinfested mangrove swamps have always limited access to 
monrovia which is home to half a million people onefifth of 
liberias population 
now the swamps are an ally of embattled president samuel doe as 
he struggles to hold off the rebels besieging his capital 
the insurgents made consistent headway for seven months and 
closed in on monrovia several weeks ago however contrary to 
predictions of western governments who expected his speedy fall 
doe has held on holed up in a beachfront fortress 
but the civil war accompanied by bloody tribal conflict is a 
bitter irony in a nation whose very existence was meant to be a 
celebration of freedom 
liberia was founded in 1847 as black africas first independent 
republic created by freed american slaves who were brought back to 
the coast of west africa by humanitarian societies 
but the newcomers were cut off from their african roots by 
generations of slavery and had no region or tribe would recognize 
them 
even liberias state motto the love of liberty brought us 
here refers to the freed slaves and their descendants and 
ignores the very existence of 90 percent of its population 
with the arrival of the americoliberians a deal was struck 
with local chiefs for land where they could settle the newcomers 
dominated the new nation while the african tribes living in the 
interior were virtually forgotten in their own homeland 
over the years the social cultural and economic gap between 
the local tribes and the americanliberians widened the 
descendants of the freed slaves formed allpowerful masonic groups 
nd monopolized political power 
in 1980 however a group of noncommissioned officers from the 
remote inland krahn tribe staged a coup they killed president 
william r tolbert and for the first time established a government 
of liberians without any american links 
master sgt doe leader of the tribal rebellion was initially 
hailed as a liberator but he ruled his country like a tribal 
chief members of his krahn tribe and their allies the mandingos 
were given special advantages 
on several occasions opponents usually traditional tribal 
enemies tried to overthrow doe hundreds were killed 
charles taylor descendant of americoliberians and africans 
launched an invasion from neighboring ivory coast on dec 24 1989 
taylor as head of the liberian governments general service 
office had been accused of absconding with 900000 in government 
money 
does acting information minister paul allen wie remained 
defiant in the face of rebel gains 
as long as the capital and the head of the nation have not 
been captured taylor has not won the war wie said 
doe may have been helped by the fact that the rebels are not 
united 
while taylors forces were blocked on the eastern outskirts of 
the capital a rival rebel leader prince johnson fought his way 
into the city 
johnson is the son of a gio hunter and a former army lieutenant 
but little is known about him but he has quarreled with taylor 
who has reportedly threatened to kill him 
so even as the rebels fight to topple doe the taylorjohnson 
rivalry sets the stage for another clash between americoliberians 
and african peoples

survivors would be found the hyatt was one of eight hotels which 
collapsed in the july 16 quake 
local miners and other volunteers vowed to keep looking until 
all the missing were accounted for 
calabia said he miss mallorca and a male employee were on the 
third floor near the elevator when the quake struck all three 
dived under tables and then the ceiling fell in he said in a 
radio interview

government charges of a 
communist plot to seize power have cast a shadow over talks on 
ending whiteminority rule and put pressure on the african national 
congress alliance with the communists 
the police claim to have uncovered evidence of a conspiracy by 
the south african communist party and elements of the ancs 
military wing to seize power if talks on ending white rule fail 
newspapers citing security sources reported saturday that the 
communist party has been working on plans to smuggle large 
quantities of arms into the country and establish guerrilla units 
police say they have found a number of arms dumps and have 
arrested some 40 militants though no one has been charged 
the allegations have created confusion with the government 
trading accusations and denials with the anc and the closely allied 
communist party 
police have not publicly presented evidence of their conspiracy 
claims and some antiapartheid activists believe the security 
forces are attempting to undermine blackwhite negotiations 
leaders on both sides are concerned the dispute could threaten 
efforts by the government and the anc to clear the way for 
fullscale talks on sharing political power with the black majority 
president fw de klerk and anc leader nelson mandela are 
scheduled to meet aug 6 to try to clear remaining obstacles to the 
talks including anc demands for the release of jailed militants 
the government wants an end to the ancs ineffective armed 
struggle and a ceasefire 
de klerk and other senior government leaders reportedly see the 
communists as a major threat and want communist leader joe slovo 
dropped from the anc delegation to the talks 
police say the top anc leadership is being duped by the 
communists slovo is one of several communist leaders who also hold 
top posts in the anc 
local news reports say police findings include records of 
remarks by slovo asserting that the communists are not bound by a 
commitment signed by the anc and the government in may to halt 
political violence 
slovo and other communists were part of the anc negotiating team 
in those talks 
mandela indignantly denies there is any plot to seize power de 
klerk presented him with details of police findings in a private 
meeting thursday but mandela said he was not convinced 
there is no plot as far as were concerned mandela said 
the dispute between the government and the anc has refocused 
attention on the communist party and its plans and intentions 
slovo the partys secretarygeneral says the communists are 
committed to democracy he says the party will become the voice of 
the working class in a postapartheid south africa 
the former lawyer insists the party has turned its back on its 
hardline marxist past and will seek power peacefully the party 
derides claims that it seeks to impose authoritarian rule 
despite criticisms the anc has stood by its long alliance with 
the communists mandela says he will work with anyone to end 
apartheid and the communists have long played a prominent role in 
that struggle 
the communist party keeps details of its leadership and 
membership secret making it difficult to assess its strength it 
is thought to number just a few hundred militants but many occupy 
leadership posts in the anc trade unions and other political 
groups

where else would dozens of drivers 
rendezvous in a crosscountry rally for britains classic morgan 
sports cars 
more than 50 morgans from the united states canada and europe 
are expected in this northern west virginia town monday when 
drivers who left san francisco july 11 join other morgan 
enthusiasts for a twoweek tour of the northeast 
this whole thing came about from a fantasy ive had since i 
was 6 years old said 45yearold jeremy harrison a podiatrist 
from liverpool england who organized the event ive wanted to 
drive through a hole cut in a redwood tree since i saw a photograph 
of a car doing it now ive done it 
he calls the rally morgans over america 
harrisons morgan convoy rolled into chicago on friday the 
itinerary calls for the cars including two threewheeled models 
built in 1933 to pass through detroit and ohio before arriving at 
morgantown about 75 miles south of pittsburgh monday afternoon 
meanwhile rally drivers from the east are gathering with many 
planning to meet in luray va travel to north carolina to link up 
with atlanta area morgan owners and then head to morgantown 
according to mark braunstein who arranged the rallys eastern leg 
morgantown just happened to be the right spot on the map for 
us to meet said braunstein its on the route and its name 
clinched it 
twentyone morgans including cars from germany sweden denmark 
and scotland were shipped to the united states for the rally 
harrison said 
i had a terrible time with insurance said harrison whose 
1990 lilac morgan plus eight is worth about 50000 we had more 
than 200 refusals until an agent in pennsylvania agreed to insure 
us for five weeks on the road and shipping for 13000 
founded in 1909 in malvern link england the morgan motor co 
is the worlds oldest privately owned automobile manufacturer the 
company began fashioning handcrafted woodframed open sports cars 
in 1936 after building its reputation on sports cycles and 
threewheelers 
the morgans longlouvered hood leather interior wooden dash 
and windgrabbing shape have seen only minor alterations during the 
last 50 years mechanical changes except for engine swaps have 
also been slow in coming 
theres still a button to push to lubricate the front 
suspension harrison said thats been around since 1911 
list prices for morgans range between 23000 and 38000 
depending on the model an extensive list of options including a 
rover v8 engine can push the price much higher harrison said 
added to that cost is the wait only nine cars a week are built 
by the morgan factorys 120 employees so the waiting list for the 
cars is eight years company officials said earlier this year 
customers are encouraged to observe their car being built 
harrison said i asked to have mine painted on a saturday so i 
could watch it being done 
mechanical problems speeding tickets and rain have plagued the 
drivers on the trips western leg harrison said during a rest stop 
in la crosse wis 
weve already had three speeding tickets and three 
breakdowns harrison said during a telephone interview two 
people have paid 90 speeding tickets and another driver was fined 
120 in california 
morgans are light and have powerful engines he said they 
really go 
probably the worst mechanical failure so far according to 
harrison occurred when the rear axle of a london mans morgan 
froze up 
he hadnt greased it in 10 years he didnt know he was 
supposed to said harrison that was stupid 
still harrison said everybodys thrilled 
he brought his 21yearold daughter along for the ride and his 
group includes a motherdaughter team from england and a lady who 
just wanted to see yellowstone and another person who wanted to see 
your mount rushmore 
its the trip of a lifetime he said theres already been 
some discussion of doing it again in five years

saudi arabia on saturday invited 
iraqi and kuwaiti leaders to its summer capital to settle a border 
and oil dispute that has led to the mobilization of armed forces by 
both baghdad and kuwait 
diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
oil financial and legal experts from kuwait and iraq are expected 
to meet separately in the saudi summer capital of jiddah to work 
out an agreement 
it was unclear when the meeting would be held 
the diplomatic sources said saudi foreign minister prince saud 
alfaisal saturday delivered invitations from king fahd to kuwaiti 
crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah and 
iraqs no 2 official ezzat ibrahim for a meeting in jiddah 
last week tensions flared between iraq and kuwait as baghdad 
moved 30000 troops to its border with kuwait and demanded changes 
in that countrys oil production iraq also demanded compensation 
from kuwait for 24 billion worth of oil it said kuwait pumped 
from the disputed rumailah oil field which straddles the joint 
border 
diplomatic sources said saturday the troops remained on the 
border 
iraqi president saddam hussein triggered the tensions earlier 
this month when he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of 
costing his country 14 billion by exceeding their oil production 
quotas and driving oil prices down 
during the crisis kuwaits army of about 20000 men briefly went 
on alert iraq has about 1 million men under arms 
faisals mission was preceded by an official saudi statement 
welcoming a bilateral meeting between representatives of iraq and 
kuwait in jiddah over the coming few days god willing to thrash 
out all differences through fraternal and cordial dialogue 
it said the saudi government was deeply satisfied with the 
response of both iraq and kuwait to the goodwill efforts 
iraq has termed the upcoming meeting in saudi arabia a protocol 
step and has demanded that it is followed by working talks in 
baghdad 
some of the iraqi pressure on kuwait has seemed to have already 
eased after the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
agreed to try to reach a target price of 21 per barrel for oil 
the increase was a longstanding iraqi demand

the baltic republics said saturday they wont take 
part in mikhail s gorbachevs plans to negotiate a new treaty that 
would give the 15 soviet republics more autonomy from the kremlin 
instead the presidents of latvia lithuania and estonia said 
they will proceed with joint talks with the soviet government for 
their independence 
their decision reached at a summit friday night dealt a sharp 
blow to gorbachevs plans to hold the splintering soviet union 
together as a looser confederation of sovereign states 
there was no immediate reaction from the kremlin 
at a kremlin meeting july 20 gorbachev called the union treaty 
vital to soviet government plans to transfer the nation to a market 
economy saying it would ensure a single marketoriented system in 
which all components will complement each other 
gorbachev has long promised such a revamped treaty providing a 
measure of autonomy for the soviet republics but some are taking 
their own action to sever ties with the central government 
the baltic republics have made the boldest moves toward 
secession and on friday byelorussia joined the russian republic 
the ukraine moldavia and uzbekistan in declaring sovereignty 
georgia has called for negotiations on independence 
the baltic statement signed by lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis estonias arnold ruutel and latvias anatoly gorbunov 
said the three leaders consider it impossible to participate 
in the union treaty 
it would be best if negotiations with the ussr were held 
on the basis of the threeplusone principle they said 
referring to their republics plus the soviet government the 
statement was released saturday 
the baltic republics also said they had no territorial or other 
claims on each other and asked the other 12 republics of the 
soviet union to come forward within a month with any territorial or 
other claims they might have on them 
the republic of byelorussia earlier this year made some 
territorial claims on parts of lithuania 
the baltic leaders said friday they had agreed to negotiate 
political economic legal and cultural treaties with the huge 
russian federation talks must start immediately they said after 
meeting with russian president boris n yeltsin during his vacation 
in the latvian beach resort of jurmala 
the press center of the latvian parliament quoted yeltsin as 
saying the political treaty between latvia and russia would 
recognize latvias independence yeltsin was quoted as telling 
latvian television he sees the treaties as agreements between equal 
and sovereign states 
the press center said a latvian delegation would come to moscow 
the capital of both russia and the soviet union on monday to begin 
talks 
the baltic republics were part of the russian empire but gained 
their independence amid the turmoil of world war i and the 
bolshevik revolution they were absorbed by the soviet union in 
1940 
lithuania declared outright on march 11 that it was 
reestablishing that independence and latvia and estonia followed 
with declarations that they would resume independence after 
unspecified transition periods 
gorbachev slapped a tough economic embargo on lithuania on april 
18 and on june 29 lithuania said it would freeze its declaration 
in return for an end to the blockade and the start of negotiations 
with the kremlin on secession those talks have yet to begin 
although delegations are being formed

sueddeutsche zeitung carried a similar report saturday 
neither newspaper named the 24 parliamentarians in question the 
christian democrats won 164 seats in the 400seat parliament in 
east germanys first free election on march 18 following a 
prodemocracy revolution 
krause said the claims were not true he said there was no 
cause for such a letter and added that the report may have been 
based on a misunderstanding prompted by another letter to 
faction members for unrelated talks 
the former ministry of state security known in german as stasi 
had a pervasive hold on all aspects of east german life through its 
spying it was disbanded after east germanys communist regime 
fell but its coverage was so wide that many people are tainted by 
association with it 
east germanys christian democrats are the largest party but 
govern in a coalition the christian democrats govern in west 
germany led by chancellor helmut kohl the parties plan to merge 
before allgerman elections in december and the unified party is 
expected to do well in the balloting 
leaders in both germanys are trying to hammer out an agreement 
on how and when the countries will end 45 years of postwar division 
and unify that requires agreement on the technicalities of 
electing a united parliament 
last week de maizieres governing coalition almost collapsed in 
a dispute over whether to merge before the elections and have 
balloting throughout the unified country or to hold elections in 
the separate states first then merge 
on friday the social democrats the secondbiggest faction 
agreed to remain in the coalition after de maiziere apparently 
backed down from insisting that east germany remain a separate 
nation until after the dec 2 elections 
the outcome of the dispute will determine the leadership of a 
united germany by deciding how many votes each party needs for 
parliamentary representation to win seats parties will need to 
win more votes in an election for a unified nation than in separate 
east and west german balloting 
west german law requires a minimum 5 percent showing for 
parliamentary representation and the two sides are now trying to 
agree on whether the same minimum should apply in elections planned 
dec 2 that will unify the germanys 
one proposal would involve votecounting separately in each of 
the 16 states of a unified germany another suggestion put forward 
saturday would allow smaller parties to appear on the same ballot 
as larger ones thereby increasing their chances for representation 
that practice is allowed in east german elections but not for 
national elections in west germany

the louisiana known for boozy bourbon street 
and the excesses of mardi gras has been obscured by a legislature 
burning with bills to ban abortions label bad records and 
allow a little headknocking defense of the flag 
the legislatures morality quest may have surprised outsiders 
who picture louisiana as freewheeling and laid back but naughty 
new orleans notwithstanding the religious right has a strong 
influence on louisiana politics 
the applepie issues also served as distractions from the 
states fiscal woes 
lawmakers passed a strict antiabortion bill that allowed no 
exceptions for rape or incest victims even though gov buddy 
roemer warned them hed veto it 
they almost passed a measure that would have eliminated jail 
terms for people convicted of roughing up flag burners later they 
gutted that bill and hurriedly substituted antiabortion language 
to skip procedural delays and try to get around roemers veto 
the new bill had rape and incest provisions but roemer said 
they werent broad enough he vetoed that bill friday 2 weeks 
after the regular session ended 
roemer also vetoed a bill that would have required warning 
labels on potentially offensive recordings and could have sent 
retailers to jail for selling such records to children the music 
industry had threatened to boycott new orleans if that one became 
law and roemer said he was convinced the bill unconstitutionally 
abridged freespeech rights 
lawmakers are talking about calling themselves into session in 
midaugust just to override roemers vetos 
the state legislatures stress on traditional morality really 
isnt new 
louisiana has outlawed abortion since the 1800s without 
exceptions for rape or incest only the supreme courts 1973 roe 
vs wade decision changed that 
in 1981 lawmakers passed a law requiring schoolteachers who 
teach darwins theory of evolution to also teach scientific 
creationism an alternative theory that mankind was created and 
didnt evolve from lower animals 
federal courts found scientific creationism more religious than 
scientific and said public schools shouldnt be forced to give it 
equal time 
astute politicians running for statewide office seldom miss the 
pentecostals fourth of julyweek camp meeting of some 8000 people 
at the central louisiana town of tioga 
a frequent participant is former gov edwin edwards who also 
unashamedly frequents nevada casinos and has a reputation for 
womanizing 
evangelist jimmy swaggarts sprawling complex in baton rouge 
complete with bible college audio and video recording studios and 
family worship center was a multimilliondollar boon to the state 
capitals economy at least until a sex scandal diminished the 
preachers popularity 
our people really support moral values said elton pody 
mayor of the north louisiana town of ruston who lobbied 
legislators not only on municipal issues but also for the 
antiabortion bill 
wayne parent a political science professor at louisiana state 
university suggested another possible reason for the legislatures 
affection for issues of morality the states sorry financial 
condition 
until a few years ago parent said balancing the states 
multibilliondollar budget was easy oil prices were high and oil 
taxes paid for everything 
things changed when oil prices plummeted in the mid1980s 
lawmakers have had to cut services put supposedly temporary 
sales taxes on traditionally exempt items such as groceries and 
medicine and fight over roemers tax overhaul proposals most of 
which have died 
issues of abortion the flag and smutty or drugrelated records 
were easy to deal with when the alternatives were a tight budget 
and unpopular taxes parent said 
these were almost welcome distractions said parent 
former state rep kevin reilly who once called louisiana a 
banana republic agreed with that assessment 
its a diversionary tactic no question about it said 
reilly who left the house in 1987 to devote more time to business 
and every legislative body does that he added the united 
states congress does that just recently they were talking about a 
flag burning amendment in the congress when we have this huge 
budget deficit 
not even the director of one of louisianas most conservative 
lobbying groups believes many people took the state flag bill 
seriously 
i think the flag burning bill was sort of thought of as a sort 
of horseplay send a message get a little chuckle but dont get 
too serious about it said ken ward of the louisiana moral and 
civic foundation

though it almost meant delivering her baby on the witness stand 
chavez lynch a week overdue with her first child was in the 
first stages of labor when she was taken into the courtroom in a

it was extremely obvious said municipal court judge jack 
gifford just after she started testifying she had a contraction 
and it certainly concerned me 
gifford asked lynch if she wanted to continue 
she said yes im here i want to finish this 
as soon as she finished testifying at the pretrial hearing 
lynch was wheeled out of the courtroom and rushed to a hospital

lech walesas rivals in the solidarity 
movement founded their own party on saturday and called for 
polands next president to be elected by the people not the 
parliament 
the founding completes the split of the political movement that 
struggled against the communists in the 1980s triumphed in 
elections last year and dominates polands noncommunist government 
the founding convention of the citizens movement for democratic 
action drew more than 1000 supporters many of those in the new 
party were heroes of solidaritys fight against communist rule 
organizers said they wanted the party to be an alternative to 
the center alliance a 2monthold prowalesa political party they 
said they would offer support to solidarity prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki whom walesa has often criticized 
zbigniew bujak a leader of solidarity during its underground 
years acknowleged the polarization of the movement but he said 
such a division does not have to be bad 
a democratic country is a country of different proposals we 
will have to forget about the otherwise comfortable structure in 
which the picture was black and white just us against them 
said bujak 
the new partys polish acronym is road and it played on the 
acronyms english meaning calling itself the best road to 
democracy behind the podium as bujak spoke was huge white sheet 
with a broken black line down the middle to represent a highway 
in its first political step the party convention voted nearly 
unanimously to endorse a constitutional amendment calling for the 
president to be elected by the people and not as now by the two 
chambers of parliament 
adam michnik who was once a key adviser to walesa criticized 
the center alliances call for an early presidential vote by 
parliament 
we want the whole society to decide he told a news 
conference 
the prowalesa group calls for electing walesa president by the 
current parliament this fall urges immediate privatization of the 
economy and faster ouster of holdover communists from positions of 
authority 
the new party wants early presidential elections but not by 
parliament arguing the current chamber is tainted by the 1989 
political deal that set aside a portion of seats for communists 
walesa strategists believe they can put together enough votes in 
parliament to elect the solidarity chairman president where he 
would oversee the drafting of an entirely new postcommunist 
constitution the new party sees walesa as politically vulnerable 
in a direct election 
the new partys membership includes most of walesas longtime 
advisers and allies in solidarity including filmmaker andrzej 
wajda parliamentary secretary henryk wujec and government 
ministers aleksander hall jacek kuron and witold trzeciakowski 
president wojciech jaruzelski the former communist party 
leader elected to a sixyear term a year ago already has signaled 
he will step down early 
he sent a letter to parliament on saturday saying he agreed with 
a planned september discussion on holding early presidential and 
parliamentary elections 
jaruzelskis election was meant to prevent the soviets from 
stepping in to quash reforms but now that soviet influence has 
waned across eastern europe his presence is seen as anachronistic

in the heart of asia far from the tumult of the 
kremlin a new mood of defiance and independence is taking hold 
this is the first installment of a fourpart series by an ap

townsfolk in this ancient capital of 
tiled turquoise domes and haunting memories are starting to refer 
to the soviet state in the same past tense they apply to tamerlane 
and genghis khan 
the soviet union is rotting away said alex ulko a young 
painter and english student at the university of samarkand 
within a few years asians will be shaping their own nations 
moscow is omnipresent in soviet central asia from government 
offices and communist party headquarters to donkeyriding kgb 
informants in remote hamlets 
but new political currents rooted in an islamic religious 
revival economic resentment and environmental concerns are 
carrying asian peoples inexorably further from the kremlin 
although lenins ironcast goatee still juts resolutely forward 
in city parks asians revere their own wise men in flowing white 
beards and colored robes who evoke a past few have forgotten a 
past almost palpable at night when islamic chants can be heard down 
twisting lanes shaded by mulberries 
the five central asian republics kazakhstan turkmenistan 
uzbekistan tadzhikistan and kirghizia stretch from the caspian 
sea to china an area almost as big as the united states their 50 
million inhabitants 20 million in uzbekistan make up a fifth of 
the soviet population a few examine 21st century problems in 
nuclear physics and biochemistry but many more live in rag tents 
or mud hovels as in the days of the golden horde 
in some ways central asia is marked indelibly by a century of 
russian czars and commissars but many here see the russian 
interlude as destined to be yet another turn of history no more 
vital to the present than when camels plied the silk road from 
china to europe 
new political parties ecological movements moslem clergymen in 
reopened mosques and young radicals all press for broader freedoms 
leading to independence even local communist party cadres are 
insisting on greater home rule 
perestroika has brought truth but truth has brought unrest 
noted agzam rahmidov an english professor in this old crossroads 
city in uzbekistan 
for one thing central asians complain of economic exploitation 
the uzbekistan prime minister shukrulla mirsaidov contends his 
people pay out three times as much to the central government as 
they get back 
in june uzbekistan and tadzhikistan refused to export food to 
other republics at the low prices decreed by the state later the 
uzbek parliament adopted a preliminary declaration of 
sovereignty 
antimoscow sentiment reaches deep into daily life 
russian settlers are leaving the region at a quickening pace 
spurred by sporadic pogroms against ethnic minorities youths are 
evading the military draft and rebelling against officers they 
accuse of bias 
in a nation fraught with more immediate crises these pressures 
stew largely out of sight 
in june a border clash between uzbeks and kirghizis in the old 
holy city of osh commanded attention as the official death toll 
mounted to as high as 800 but when soviet troops imposed calm the 
spotlight moved on 
the situation in central asia is very serious and we dont 
understand it fully said igor krupnik a conflict specialist at 
the academy of sciences in moscow no one has the data 
the problem central asians say is that distant analysts are 
often thrown off by convenient generalities about peoples who are 
anything but homogeneous 
over millennia borders were traced across the sands by 
conquerors from the mongol hordes to turkish tyrants like 
tamerlane to the russian czars josef stalin drew the last map in 
the 1920s when the regions of turkestan and eastern bukhara were 
transformed into five republics 
the plains of kazakhstan biggest and northernmost of the five 
separate european russia from asia to the south lie the other 
four in the east the small mountainous enclaves of tadzhikistan 
and kirghizia bordering china and afghanistan in the west the 
highlands and deserts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan stretching 
toward the oilfields of the caspian sea 
these central asian neighbors are linked by the koran and often 
by common linguistic roots but just as often they are divided by 
disputes over land and water 
in the soviet grand plan the whole region was given over to 
cotton fields were irrigated from the majestic rivers amu darya 
and syr darya and russian migrants settled frontier lands today 
only 40 percent of the kazakhstan population is kazakh 
but decades of poor planning have so bled the rivers that they 
no longer replenish the aral sea half of the worlds fourth 
largest lake has dried up its exposed lakebed now just loose salt 
poisoned by pesticide runoff to revive the aral sea uzbeks want 
to cut off the karakum canal used by the turkmens to water their 
desert 
land was exploited in the most disgusting colonial way said 
sergei kapitsa of the physical problems institute in the soviet 
academy of sciences 
central asian planners want to diversify from cotton but the 
region is short of energy and the tadzhiks ensconced in high 
mountains balk at flooding villages for more hydroelectic dams 
in this climate of tension an isolated skirmish over a piece of 
scarce farmland like the one in osh can flash overnight into 
pitched battles in capital cities hundreds of miles apart 
explosive mixtures have resulted from past soviet policies of 
dispersing inconvenient minorities to onceremote areas such as 
the fergana valley which includes osh 
last year rampaging uzbeks killed at least 100 people in 
pogroms against turks resettled from georgia almost two generations 
ago other minorities including russians were also targeted

this february an estimated 50 people were killed in riots in 
the tadzhik capital dushanbe reportedly touched off by rumors 
that armenian refugees would settle there in may mobs burned 47 
homes of armenians and jews in the fergana valley 
authorities cite local causes for each outbreak sometimes 
blaming unnamed political opportunists religious fanatics or 
drugcrazed hooligans but others see deeper roots 
the problem is social frustration among a generation of youths 
who are losing their old values and see nothing to replace them 
said munira shadheedi a historian in dushanbe 
opposition politicians mostly writers and other intellectuals 
see a policy vacuum as communist party stalwarts push ahead with 
only modifications of ideas that have failed to inspire confidence 
these new leaders say it is too early to design specific 
programs for independence first most say they must abolish 
entrenched official corruption which impoverishes and embitters 
their populations 
alternative parties are beginning to attract wide support the 
uzbekistan popular front birlik has inspired similar movements in 
other republics krupnik said he saw signs these disparate 
opposition groups were linking up forging the beginnings of a 
grassroots movement across central asia 
their main obstacle is a historical aversion to mixing among 
ethnic groups in the region he said 
if central asia mixes anywhere it is here in samarkand a city 
of 390000 people that recently celebrated its 2500th anniversary 
the old mud synagogue blends unnoticed into a block of moslem 
houses men of all religions wear the same square black skullcaps 
embroidered in white a multitude of nationalities sits together 
for tea and patterned wheels of bread escaping the sun under shade 
trees 
but a chat with samarkand university students suggests that this 
harmony of old is changing fast 
a crimean tatar woman felt growing antipathy and said her family 
wanted badly to get home her russianukrainian friend said uzbeks 
are making up for lost time in reasserting national pride 
there is a very dark fear which is difficult to understand

after passing the states largest tax hike in 
history massachusetts legislators tried to junk that plan and 
tried to pass an even bigger package then on the same day they 
decided to return to the original plan 
this is really a test joked state rep john flood they 
want to see how many dumb votes the legislature will make in one 
week 
but not many people have been laughing especially not the wall 
street analysts who have dropped massachusetts bond rating below 
every other state 
the legislature finally enacted a balanced 1343 billion 
budget early saturday morning and a 143 billion bond 
authoritization but for months massachusetts had struggled to 
solve its fiscal difficulties 
as massachusetts economy continued to sink the state ran up a 
deficit exceeding 1 billion in the fiscal year that ended june 30 
last weeks events seemed to set new standards for statehouse 
chaos and they came just when it appeared the state had put its 
troubles behind 
it will be less than a week before the massachusetts 
legislature makes it into johnny carsons monologue remarked 
james braude head of the tax equity alliance for massachusetts a 
group that favors higher taxes 
after wrangling over the escalating budget deficit lawmakers 
had sent gov michael s dukakis a 12 billion tax package 
dukakis signed the law proclaiming the miracle is beginning 
to revive a reference to the massachusetts miracle theme of 
his failed 1988 presidential campaign 
then legislative negotiators agreed on a budget for the fiscal 
year that began july 1 never mind that the budget was more than 
three weeks late massachusetts has made this a habit in recent 
years forcing the state to adopt temporary spending plans 
but the 137 billion budget presented monday still had a 200 
millionplus deficit dukakis would be able to bring balance it 
with his lineitem veto powers but nonetheless lawmakers who were 
still smarting over the tax battle decided to revolt 
what emerged to nearly everyones shock was a proposal to 
repeal the justpassed tax plan which included a controversial 
sales tax on business services and substitute another version 
athat would cut the tax on services but make income taxes even 
higher the strategy was to appease house members by giving them a 
package resembling a tax plan they approved earlier in the year 
in the end though the plan to do a flipflop on the tax plan 
failed the house ways and means committee endorsed the measure 
but the resulting firestorm through the statehouse killed it 
almost lost during the confusion was the fact that the state 
still had that new tax law on the books 
even senate president william bulger known for his strong 
authority said during the height of the recent chaos i am here 
and i am bewildered 
this is appalling said francis faulkner of citizens for 
limited taxation an antitax group you have legislators asking 
whats going on these are people who are supposed to represent the 
state 
faulkners group is counting on public anger toward the 
legislature because his organization is sponsoring a ballot 
petition in november that would roll back state taxes and fees to 
1988 levels thereby undoing the new tax law 
also in november voters will choose a new governor to replace 
dukakis whose popularity tumbled like the states bond ratings and 
who decided against seeking reelection 
both democrats and republicans have campaigned against dukakis 
policies saying the antics in the legislature demonstrate a lack 
of leadership 
this is far beyond a partisan issue this is a matter of 
whether people in other parts of the country think were crazy 
said francis bellotti a democratic gubernatorial contender and 
former attorney general 
the house blames the senate the senate blames the house 
everybody blames the governor he said this is absolute 
insanity

the execution of a convicted killer should 
end weeks of controversy over whether floridas electric chair is a 
valid means of execution or a torture device as defense attorneys 
claimed the governor said 
florida should now be able to resume carrying out its capital 
punishment statute gov bob martinez said after anthony 
bertolotti was pronounced dead friday evening 
the people of florida can know that criminals who show a total 
disregard for human life will indeed be called upon to pay the 
ultimate penalty for their actions the governor said 
during the may 4 execution of jesse joseph tafero flames and 
sparks shot from the inmates head and smoke filled the execution 
chamber tafero was finally declared dead after three jolts of 
electricity 
attorneys for three condemned inmates won indefinite stays from 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta with arguments 
that the electric chair was not functioning properly 
as a result martinez ordered an independent examination of the 
chair in a demonstration witnessed monday by the media and state 
officials michael morse an associate professor of electrical 
engineering at auburn university concluded the chair was 
functioning properly and would send a lethal amount of electricity 
through an inmates body 
prison officials said a moistened synthetic sponge contact used 
for the first and only time in the tafero execution caused flames 
to rise from his head 
on friday the us supreme court upheld a ruling by a lower 
court that the chairs 2000volt charge is sufficient to cause 
painless termination of life ending the legal alternatives for 
bertolotti 
the three cases held up by the 11th circuit would be the 
likeliest to result in the next execution the governors press 
secretary jon peck said saturday 
no decision has really been made on those other three but 
potentially at least they could be treated a little differently 
because they all are basically ready and they were awaiting a 
ruling on the workings of the chair itself peck said 
martinez a strong advocate of the death penalty applauded the 
courts decisions clearing the way for bertolottis death 
it is gratifying that the courts concluded floridas electric 
chair does in fact work as it is designed to the governor said 
todays events have begun to restore certainty to floridas 
ultimate penalty and i commend the courts for moving toward that 
eventual end he said 
bertolotti was sentenced to die for the sept 27 1983 murder 
of carol ward she was working in her yard in orange county when 
bertolotti approached and asked to use the telephone and she let 
him in 
he grabbed a knife robbed her of 30 and then stabbed her 
repeatedly until the knife broke he then found another knife and 
stabbed her until she died leaving the knife in her body at some 
point bertolotti removed her clothes and raped her 
an unrepentant bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors 
after his conviction saying he wasnt sorry 
i have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of carol ward 
he wrote she should have locked her damn door i really did a 
favor by taking her life dont you think so 
bertolotti was the 23rd inmate to die in the electric chair 
dubbed old sparky since florida resumed executions in 1979 
since inmates carved old sparky from an oak tree almost 
seven decades ago it has killed 219 state murderers and rapists 
and one federal killer

alberto fujimori the novice politician whose 
election shocked perus power brokers was sworn in today as 
president of a country beset by staggering political and economic 
problems 
fujimori assumed power from outgoing president alan garcia in an 
elaborate ceremony in the capital earlier in the day government 
helicopters flew over lima and thousands of policemen and soldiers 
patrolled city streets 
despite the security measures rebels late friday blew up two 
electrical towers to black out most of the city for the second 
consecutive night 
earlier in the week guerrillas fired two rocketpropelled 
grenades at the presidential palace recent fighting in the 
countrys andean mountains and amazonian jungle has left hundreds 
dead 
the violence prompted the heavy security for todays ceremony 
which was to be attended by a us delegation headed by secretary 
of education lauro cavazos 
perus economy has become increasingly unstable in the days 
leading up to fujimoris swearingin to fiveyear term 
many banks have run out of money and workers cannot cash their 
checks people must wait hours to buy rationed gasoline and bread 
the dollars value jumped more than 75 percent in one week 
daily inflation topped the 6 percent mark by the end of the 
week according to the private economic firm cuanto until last 
week daily inflation had been running at about 1 percent 
key to reversing the economic collapse will be what fujimori 
says upon taking office analysts say confidence in his government 
will quickly evaporate if he does not soon offer detailed plans to 
combat the crisis they say 
fujimori has proposed harsh but vague measures to bring perus 
economy under control he said he wants to end price subsidies 
sell off many government companies and impose an emergency tax on 
the wealthy 
fujimori plans a devaluation of the peruvian inti that will make 
the dollar cost 300 percent to 400 percent more 
he has already met in new york with the heads of the 
international monetary fund and the world bank peru has been 
isolated from world lenders since outgoing president garcia cut 
ties with the two institutions in 1986 
but the new president will have little to work with the 
government is bankrupt and paralyzed by strikes four of five 
people lack steady work the country is 20 billion in debt perus 
main export is coca the main ingredient used to make cocaine 
the peru fujimori inherits also suffers from a severe drought 
that has wiped out crops and drastically cut urban water supplies 
hydroelectric plants run at half capacity and the daily blackouts 
that result have greatly slowed industry 
politically fujimoris small change 90 party is nearly isolated 
since his landslide victory over novelist and freemarket 
advocate mario vargas llosa june 10 fujimori has cut many ties 
with the left and centerleft parties that supported his campaign 
garcia a populist has called on workers to resist any economic 
shock program 
but perus centerright parties have also shown little desire to 
aid fujimori former president fernando belaunde terry has said 
these parties were elected to form fujimoris opposition 
perus military however has been less reluctant to work with 
the new president an unprecidented three cabinet positions 
defense interior and fisheries will be held by military officers 
the presence of a general atop perus powerful interior ministry 
likely signals a steppedup effort to combat the countrys two main 
guerrilla groups analysts say perus police force is controlled 
by the interior ministry 
the move comes as the maoist shining path and the procuban 
tupac amaru revolutionary movement have stepped up attacks 
more than 19000 peruvians have died in political violence in 
the past 10 years

gunmen killed four more police officers 
in medellin three of them after the citys cocaine cartel declared 
an end to its campaign of bombings and assassinations police said 
saturday 
minutes before the extraditables as the medellin drug bosses 
call themselves sent a message by facsimile mail to the local 
press friday calling for a truce gunmen killed a police officer 
according to a police statement 
three other police officers were assassinated later in the day 
the statement said 
we decree a unilateral indefinite ceasefire and we suspend 
attacks against police bombings in all colombian cities and the 
executions of politicians journalists judges and other

responsible for the murders of 215 police officers this year in 
medellin and the surrounding region 
the authenticity of the statement could not be independently 
verified 
police say the cartel is paying assassins 4000 for each police 
officer killed 
the extraditables statement said the killings were in 
retaliation for the murder and torture of suspected cartel members 
by police 
police deny the charge human rights officials say there is 
strong evidence that members of the force are participating in 
slayings in medellins poorer neighborhoods where the cartels 
killers are based 
about the same time the cartels statement was being released a 
bomb exploded at a police post in the medellin neighborhood of 
villanueva wounding five people including a child police said

sources as saying that fridays communique by the cartel was part 
of a strategy by cartel leader pablo escobar to have the government 
scale down its escape manhunt for him 
earlier this year the medellin cartel suspended its terrorist 
attacks as part of a peace overture to the goverment the violence 
resumed after the administration of president virgilio barco ruled 
out negotiations with the cartel

traffickers have been blamed for the deaths pf more than 450 
colombians in terrorist attacks 
the government is continuing to crack down on the traffickers

medellin residents suspected of working for the drug cartel as 
hired killers an army communique said

police salaries by 25 percent police now earn about 100 a month 
not including benefits 
the low salaries are repeatedly signaled as a major cause of 
police corruption and inefficiency

unauthorized signs depicting a frowning face at the beginning of 
road construction along westbound interstate 70 just east of 
suburban reynoldsburg and a smiling face at the end of it were 
ordered removed thursday 
officials believe the inent of the unidentified signmaker was to 
make the going a little easier for constructionweary motorists 
passing through the threemile site the signs were erected 
sometime wednesday night 
i think they are cute but they are dangerous said michael 
cull spokesman for the ohio department of transportation 
in all four signs dotted the route the first bore a frown the 
second had no expression the third showed a hint of a smile and 
the final face at the end of the construction wore a wide grin 
the signs appeared official and resembled the yellowandblack 
have a nice day pins and stickers that were seemingly 
ubiquitous several years ago 
cull said the signs had to go because they were not standard 
issue he also said that any signs not designed to direct drivers 
safely through such sites are considered dangerous 
about four years ago a similar setup which had progressively 
happier faces was done by the authorities themselves in michigan 
state officials received more than 300 letters of support from 
motorists

foreign minister roland dumas said frances 
decision to pardon a convicted terrorist whose freedom had long 
been sought by iran may help win the freedom of all western 
hostages in lebanon a newspaper reported saturday 
an iranian newspaper on saturday also tied the release of anis 
naccache to the hostage issue the pardon was widely criticized by 
newspapers some politicians and various lobbying groups 
president francois mitterrand pardoned naccache and four 
accomplices friday and put them on a plane for tehran 
naccache had served 10 years of a life sentence for the failed 
assassination of shahpour bakhtiar irans prime minister before 
the 1979 islamic revolution 
a policeman and a passerby were killed and another policeman 
paralyzed in the 1980 assassination attempt in paris 
naccache was allegedly acting on iranian orders and his 
imprisonment has been a major object of contention between france 
and iran 
this measure excuses neither the crime nor the criminals 
foreign minister roland dumas told the le monde newspaper in a 
saturday interview 
dumas said he expected the freeing of naccache to result in a 
general calming a lowering of tensions in the region and i also 
hope we are working toward it the liberation of all western 
hostages still held in lebanon 
dumas words increased speculation that the release of naccache 
could help efforts to free the 16 western hostages in lebanon 
including six americans 
an official iranian news agency report said on july 7 that a 
european hostage would soon be released syrian military sources in 
lebanon said the released hostage would likely be brian keenan an 
irish teacher held hostage in lebanon for four years but no word 
has been heard from his kidnappers 
the tehran times an english language newspaper in iran wrote 
saturday that naccaches release can even be expected to add to 
the optimism that has been created for the release of one or two 
european hostages 
the paper is believed to reflect the thinking of iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani 
it urged other western governments to follow the french lead 
saying such moves can facilitate the iranian republics 
humanitarian efforts to convince the lebanese groups to free the 
hostages 
france is the only western nation that has managed to free all 
its hostages from lebanon 
besides keenan proiranian shiite moslem groups in lebanon hold 
six americans four britons two west germans two swiss and an 
italian 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
iran claims the former government of premier jacques chirac made 
a deal to pardon naccache in exchange for the freedom of the last 
three french hostages held in lebanon they were freed in may 1988 
days before the french presidential election which chirac lost 
chirac a conservative denied again friday any deal had been 
struck 
dumas also said there had been no negotiations on the issue with 
tehran 
but iran has made its wishes known on numerous occasions and 
france has met many other iranian demands 
in june 1986 france expelled massoud rajavi head of a guerrilla 
group fighting to overthrow the iranian government and in november 
1987 provided a plane to tehran for iranian embassy translator 
wahid gordji he had been wanted for questioning in a 1986 wave of 
bombings in paris in each case french hostages were freed 
france also repaid part of a 1 billion debt to iran french 
observers predict the freeing of naccache will aid in settling the 
financial dispute which dates to the 1979 iranian revolution and 
pave the way for business ventures 
the chief lawyer for naccache antoine comte said saturday the 
families of the five freed terrorists paid 740000 in damages to 
the victims as ordered in 1982 by the court 
half of the money is to go to bernard vigna who was paralyzed 
for life in the assassination attempt but the policemans mother 
told agence francepresse the french news agency that the family 
did not want dirty money the family refused to comment on the 
release of naccache saying only their reaction was bad

supreme court nominee david h souter if 
confirmed could provide key votes on such issues as abortion 
counseling fetal protection and school desegregation in the 
199091 court term that begins oct 1 
the justices could be closely divided on those and other issues 
already docketed for decision and souters views on them are a 
mystery 
legal scholars and lawyers following the cases say retired 
justice william j brennans votes would have been predictably 
liberal the book on souter hes a conservative the big question 
how conservative 
were going from a known quantity in brennan to an unknown 
said clarke forsythe general counsel of americans united for life 
an antiabortion group closely watching the abortioncounseling and 
fetalprotection cases before the court 
at issue in the first are federal regulations that bar 
governmentfinanced family planning centers from counseling women 
about abortion the regulations are being attacked as alleged 
violations of freespeech and abortion rights 
the socalled title x program gives about 200 million a year to 
some 4000 clinics nationwide that serve about 5 million lowincome 
women 
forsythe who wants the court to uphold the regulations says he 
expects justices thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul 
stevens the courts three most liberal members to vote to strike 
them down 
he said he hoped the courts conservative bloc chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy will unite to say 
the regulations are valid 
its not an easy case and souter could play a key role 
forsythe said 
the second case could affect millions of working women the 
court must decide whether employers may exclude all women of 
childbearing age from some hazardous but comparatively 
highpaying jobs to protect their fetuses 
at issue is a car battery manufacturers policy of banning women 
who cannot prove they are infertile from jobs that expose them to 
lead 
justice brennan will be missed in both the workplace case and 
the title x case said patricia ireland of the national 
organization for women 
he would have found the fetal protection policy to be 
offensive and inappropriate in that it ignores what exposure to 
lead does to mens reproductive systems and he had a great history 
of respect for freedom of speech and womens rights ms ireland 
said 
susan ross of the sex discrimination center at georgetown 
universitys law school said the outcome of the fetal protection 
case could hinge on souter 
we have reason to hope that blackmun marshall and stevens 
will be with us and we think oconnor probably will be with us 
ms ross said we dont have much hope of picking up rehnquist 
kennedy or scalia perhaps white will vote against the policy but 
im not optimistic its possible the outcome could depend on 
souter 
she added souter hasnt had to deal with 
employmentdiscrimination matters its very difficult to fathom 
where hed come out 
the court also must decide whether public school districts may 
abandon the forced busing of students after achieving racial 
balance in their schools if such a move would lead to resegregation 
the ruling in an oklahoma city case could be enormously 
important for the hundreds of school districts including those in 
most major cities under courtordered busing plans for racial 
desegregation 
i would suspect justice brennan would not have been on our 
side in this one said william pendley of the conservative 
mountain states legal foundation his absence from the case is a 
positive step but souter would be a question mark 
even american business is busy assessing the impact of brennans 
exit and souters possible entrance most immediately in the 
controversy over the skyrocketing awards won in personal injury 
lawsuits and other cases 
at issue in a case the court has under study is whether such 
awards can go so high they become unconstitutional the justices 
last year said whopping awards never can violate the constitutions 
ban on excessive fines but it left unanswered whether they might 
violate dueprocess rights 
this is a big one and we generally knew where justice brennan 
was coming from said jan amundson general counsel of the 
national association of manufacturers he wasnt always 
antibusiness but souter is an unknown were optimistic but 
uncertain 
the court began its summer recess last month with 54 cases 
already scheduled for argument and decision in the coming term the 
justices likely will add 80 to 90 more cases to that docket through 
next winter 
next year at this time i wouldnt be surprised to count 15 or 
20 decisions that would have gone the other way had brennan still 
been on the court northwestern university law professor lawrence 
marshall said 
others are more interested in which not how many cases will 
fall into that category

teenagers with time on their hands and 
gas in their tanks poured into this town for its first officially 
sanctioned cruisin night turning the narrow streets into a kind 
of appalachian graffiti 
whether riding in ttop sports cars sitting on the tailgates of 
parked pickups or just standing on the street corner sipping free 
soft drinks the teenagers made the scene friday night 
you drive around and holler at some girls and park and they 
come by and see you and pull in and talk to you said 16yearold 
freddie anderson of belfry ky as he sat on the roof of his 
camaro 
officials and merchants in this town on the kentuckywest 
virginia border thought up cruisin night after officials in 
several other cities cracked down on cruisers by enforcing traffic 
and loitering laws 
prizes were awarded in four categories best looking cruiser 
car best looking cruiser truck loudest cruiser and 
best vanity plate other prizes were awarded based on random 
drawings from registrations at the end of the threehour event 
the teenage traffic jam resembled scenes from the movie 
american graffiti which depicted cruisers in a california town 
in the early 1960s 
downtown williamson was packed friday night with teenagers and 
occasionally with older drivers who found themselves caught in the 
bumpertobumper traffic sometimes with panicked expressions 
as the sun went down the ttops came off and the car stereos 
came on the rap song pump up the jam filled the air 
some drivers parked their cars and trucks and watched the others 
drive up two blocks on second avenue left one block on pike 
street down two blocks on third avenue and left one block on 
harvey street ready to begin the circuit again 
a line of cars stretching across two bridges into kentucky 
waited to join the parade in this town of 5000plus people 
it gets pretty boring after a while but theres nothing else 
to do here said heather gannon 15 as she sat on the tailgate 
of a pickup truck this is it 
richard foster 20 said he and the halfdozen young men with 
him would have come downtown even without the cruisin night 
promotion 
were always here said foster a weekend cruiser for five 
years 
city police sgt re pyrtle walking his beat said the 
promotion appeared to bring the teenagers downtown a little 
earlier than usual but said there was no trouble 
friday and saturday nights the kids mainly come here about 10 
oclock and cruise but not to the extent it is tonight he said 
as the cruisers cruised friday night several adults watched 
from park benches outside the mingo county courthouse 
i think its just fine if it works out right said inice 
ball 79 i think its fine for our young people because theres 
nothing for them to do here 
williamsons invitation to the teenage cruisers contrasts with 
what other area cities are doing 
in charleston nearly 60 miles to the northeast police reacted 
to merchant complaints about noisy littering teens this summer by 
strictly enforcing traffic regulations 
across the tug river from williamson in south williamson ky 
police have taken steps to block cruisers from congregating in a 
mall parking lot 
but colin berry president of the williamson merchants 
association and an organizer of cruisin night declined to 
criticize officials who want to put the brakes to cruising 
its not up to me to judge what someone else should do he 
said different towns have different problems

slipping into anarchy and national suicide called for an 
urgent un security council meeting and suggested that us 
troops intervene 
while the forces of national patriotic front leader charles 
taylor remained blocked by government troops six miles east of the 
capital the smaller force of a rival rebel leader prince johnson 
advanced into the city 
johnsons disciplined rebel forces neatly dressed in camouflage 
uniforms carefully picked off snipers nests as they moved up the 
steep hill toward the ducor palace hotel which has a view of the 
city center rifle and machine gun fire reverberated across the 
hill as civilians hid in their houses 
johnsons rebels took control of the waterside and west point 
districts at the city end of one of the two bridges from bushrod 
island the island is on the opposite side of the city from does 
mansion one mile away 
doe has pledged to make his final stand inside the heavily 
fortified mansion the rebels who began their offensive in 
december accuse the government of corruption and human rights 
abuses and demand does resignation 
the five ambassadors representing european economic community 
nations issued their warning friday italian ambassador gianguido 
lanzoni advised his government on behalf of all the eec ambassadors 
that the interdependence of nations no longer permits other 
nations to sit idle while one country plunges into anarchy and 
national suicide 
there is no longer any effective government in control of this 
country lanzoni told his government in a cable he advised his 
government to call the un security council into emergency session 
to discuss the chaos and killing of civilians on both sides in 
liberias civil war 
and he suggested the european countries should look favorably on 
any american move to intervene in view of the special 
relationship between liberia and the united states there are 
four us warships off the coast of the west african nation 
founded by the descendants of freed american slaves 
but the united states has refused to intervene saying the war 
is an internal liberian affair 
the civil war has degenerated into tribal war between members of 
does krahn tribe and gio and mano tribesmen many of whom support 
the rebels diplomats say both sides have indiscriminately killed 
civilians 
taylor in a message broadcast friday and saturday over a local 
radio station declared the dissolution of does government and 
promised to hold elections in six months taylor said the doe 
government was to be replaced by a national patriotic 
reconstruction assembly of which he will be leader 
but reports from rebelheld territory said taylor remained 30 
miles from the front and his forces were making little progress 
one of taylors commanders conceded the government was still 
holding spriggspayne airfield in eastern monrovia 
on the other side of town does hardpressed troops retreated 
with one of their three tanks from broad street near the ducor to 
center street outside the defense ministry about half a mile from 
the mansion 
the tank was so crammed with goods looted from shops in the 
neighbourhood that the crew barely had room to maneuver 
streets in the city center were deserted and all shops remained 
closed 
a group of three foreign reporters walked through the nomans 
land between the two armies and into the rebeloccupied waterside 
district they spoke with rebels who were engaged in heavy 
exchanges of gunfire with government forces 
at the junction of united nations drive and west point road two 
bodies lay in the street when the reporters went past the same 
place an hour later another body was lying on the sidewalk all 
were dead soldiers 
market people in west point watched the fighting from their 
houses which had fallen behind rebel lines overnight they sold 
what little food they had left mostly tea bags and small tins of 
tomato paste fishermen set their nets to haul in sardines which 
they sold at 250 a pound a tiny sea ray was offered for 50 cents 
half a mile from the rebel checkpoint at west point two 
government soldiers had pulled up in a car and were talking to the 
wife of one of them ahead of them was only the empty street 
littered with garbage 
the wife hurredly threw her husband a pair of jeans a tshirt 
and shoes yelling change change then she was gone while the 
soldier shamefacedly began taking off his army uniform and putting 
on his civilian disguise

loan guarantees to iraq the senate also moved to bar sales of 
weapons and sensitive technology to iraq

by the house were signs of growing congressional concern about 
iraqs human rights abuses intimidation of its neighbors 
harboring of terrorists and developing chemical and nuclear weapons 
programs 
the iraqi legislator saad mahdi saleh warned iraq may impose 
its own sanctions against the united states 
we flatly refrain from having economic relations with those 
who have no interest in having economic relations with us saleh

ruling baath party said the senate decision was motivated by the 
proisraeli lobby in the united states

the first iraqi reaction to the friday vote

surprise at the illogical decision taken by those congress members

balloon pilot james johnson has drawn a 
lot of attention at the 1990 us national hot air balloon 
championship 
for one thing the 72yearold johnson is the oldest entrant in 
this years championship which ends sunday 
and unlike most other pilots he literally flies by the seat of 
his pants sitting beneath his multicolored homemade balloon the 
wallaby in a chair instead of the usual brown wicker basket 
i wanted to do something a little different said johnson 
who took his first balloon ride at age 60 you do get an awful 
lot of attention everywhere you go youre a star 
although he owns a traditional ballooning basket johnson said 
he enjoys a more openair feeling when hes flying 
im so used to this thing that it doesnt bother me anymore 
he said i like this one better

employees of a federally funded job 
training center held parties at a fine resort and bought vcrs for 
home use thanks to a loophole allowing them to spend interest on 
federal grants any way they wanted now some congressmen are 
seeking to close that loophole 
all told the south central private industry council a 
federally financed job assistance agency spent more than 20000 
on parties and other luxuries in the last four years 
the council has been investigated over the last three months 
and the probes findings may lead congress to revise a federal law 
that allows job agencies to spend interest earned on federal job 
training partnership act money at their own discretion 
it hurts the public perception of carrying out the intent of 
the program this is out there for training disadvantaged and 
displaced workers said david williams deputy assistant 
secretary of the us department of labor which oversees the job 
program 
williams said several congressmen have moved to revise the law 
to mandate that money be used only for job training 
the scpic one of 17 such agencies in wisconsin has a 24 
million budget this year and employs nine workers it is 
responsible for training unemployed and displaced workers in four 
southcentral wisconsin counties and finding them jobs 
of the 20900 spent by the council 13509 was for the last 
three annual meetings held each august at the chula vista resort in 
wisconsin dells a popular tourist haven 
last august council members spent about 4000 on the annual 
party including 2450 on lodging dinners drinks and nightclub 
admissions 480 to rent a boat for a ride around a lake and 400 
for hors doeuvres records showed 
in december the council spent 951 on a christmas party for the 
staff at the fur fin and feather restaurant in oxford 
and earlier this year the council staff purchased four 
videocassette recorders at a cost of 1196 employees took them 
home 
administrators defended the purchases saying the workers would 
use the equipment at home to bolster skills they lack the time to 
improve in the office 
when an audit first disclosed the spending the councils former 
marketing director jane stroede and others defended the parties 
as a necessary means for thanking volunteer board members 
i dont think fun is against the public interest ms 
stroede said in april 
but the council has since changed its position after months of 
stinging criticism from government watchdogs it has fired its 
director mary zilisch and created a committee to review all 
spending and operations 
council board member ronald thompson chairman of the review 
committee said the board will vote in the next month on 
improvements including a recommendation that no taxpayer money be 
used for parties 
its a matter of public perception thompson said in 
explaining the changes 
state officials are also promising the agency will get plenty of 
increased regulation 
but even with the changes the council may have done irreparable 
harm by ruining public trust and blemishing a program that many 
government watchdogs already have distrusted for years some say 
theyve got a terrible record said former us sen william 
proxmire a wisconsin democrat who built a reputation during his 
three decades in congress for demanding frugal spending with his 
golden fleece awards 
he claimed the program has cost 185 billion since the act 
passed in 1982 but statistics show it helps only one in 20 
participants get off welfare

political newcomer alberto fujimori sworn in 
saturday as president of beleaguered peru offered dialogue with 
marxist rebels and promised fairer treatment for the south american 
nations poor 
the new president attacked corruption and pledged to lead 
debtridden peru back into the international community of nations 
he also said the blame for the international narcotics problem 
lies with cocaineconsuming nations as well as drugproducing 
nations like peru peru is the worlds main source of the coca 
plant from which cocaine comes 
the bespectacled 52yearold former college president an upset 
winner in elections in june accepted the redandwhite sash of 
office and said i swear by god to try to solve perus problems 
peruvians are fed up with being fed up he said 
fujimoris comments at the ceremony in the redcarpeted 
cedarpaneled the house of representatives chamber brought cheers 
from lawmakers 
the new president was celebrating his birthday on saturday 
which is also perus independence day 
fujimori who is to serve until 1995 faces daunting problems 
he mentioned the 22 million percent inflation over the past five 
years increasing poverty its bloated bureaucracy drug 
trafficking and terrorism 
the people elected us to institute a new language of 
nationwide understanding the language of dialogue cooperation 
and a search for consensus fujimori said the backdrop was a 
bronze frieze of gen jose de san martin perus 19thcentury 
liberator and a large wooden crucifix 
the new president asked for special congressional power to 
decree new and fairer taxes presumably on perus wealthy elite 
he said he would set up a special anticorruption committee 
simplify customs regulations reduce government participation in 
the economy and push for measures to give ordinary peruvians 
greater access to government officials 
when fujimori said his administration would be implacable in 
its fight against government corruption many members of congress 
stood up and chanted their approval 
the new leader did not mention by name his leftist populist 
predecessor alan garcia who took office in 1985 but he said we 
inherited a disaster 
garcias farewell speech drew boos from some lawmakers and a 
few walked out 
fujimori said he would scrap a banknationalization law that 
went on the books under garcia but never was implemented he 
repeated a campaign pledge to reverse garcias policy of freezing 
out perus creditors and ignoring the 20 billion foreign debt 
our administration is resolved to reestablish perus 
international relations in the financial field the new president 
said he said he hopes to stimulate foreign investment in peru 
on drugs fujimori took a stand similar to that of president 
virgilio barco of colombia barco who was on hand for the 
inauguration along with the presidents of argentina bolivia 
chile and venezuela 
fujimori said cocaineconsuming countries are just as 
responsible for stopping drug use as are south american nations 
that grow coca leaf and turn it into cocaine 
you cannot place the weight of the responsibility for this 
fight on a poor country buried in a severe economic crisis 
fujimori said he said peruvian peasants who grow coca to survive 
need an alternative 
the bush administration is pressuring the andean nations to 
militarize their fight against the cocaine trade washington has 
offered peru 35 million in military aid 
this is not a simple military question due to the obvious 
and indisputable demand of a powerful market outside peru 
fujimori said 
the new president also proposed reason and dialogue to deal 
with marxist rebels political violence has resulted in about 
19000 deaths in the last decade 
fujimori said peru also must improve living conditions in the 
remote impoverished andean highlands where terrorists 
principally the fanatical marxist shining path rebels have their 
strongholds 
garcia had also called for dialogue with terrorist groups but 
the response was increased assassinations and bombings

the mcmartin preschool child molestation 
case began in a wildfire of bizarre accusations that swept in from 
the seaside community of manhattan beach to engulf southern 
california for seven years 
when the longest costliest case in us history ended last week 
with a deadlocked jury the passion that ignited it was all but 
extinguished and the anger that kept it going erupted only 
intermittently 
but left in the ashes of the mcmartin case are many victims 
raymond buckey 32 who endured five years in jail and two 
trials said his family suffered beyond measure 
the jury in the first trial acquitted buckey of 40 charges last 
january and cleared his mother peggy mcmartin buckey of 12 
counts that jury deadlocked on 13 counts against buckey and 
prosecutors refiled eight 
the jury in his second trial deadlocked friday on eight 
molestation charges and a mistrial was declared prosecutors said 
there would be no third trial in the case that cost los angeles 
county more than 135 million 
id like to get for my family the house that was taken away 
from them buckey said afterwards peggy mcmartin buckey 63 and 
her husband charles had to sell their home and the prestigious 
school which grandmother virginia mcmartin had operated for 22 
years to pay legal costs 
buckeys sister peggy ann a teacher of handicapped children 
lost her teaching credential but won it back in a long bitter 
battle after charges against her were dismissed 
teachers betty raidor babette spitler and mary ann jackson lost 
their careers as nursery school teachers even though they were 
ultimately cleared 
the case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it the 
judge in the first trial said at one point by that i mean every 
witness every litigant and every judicial officer its a very 
upsetting case 
those words from superior court judge william pounders came 
after two witnesses had died one by his own hand the other from 
alcoholrelated disease and the children who fueled the case with 
claims of satanic rituals animal sacrifices and molestations were 
balking at repeated ordeals on the witness stand 
the newscaster who first broke the mcmartin story lost his job 
and jurors learned he had an affair with a therapist who 
interviewed the mcmartin children at childrens institute 
international 
the saga began in august 1983 when a mother reported to police 
that her son had been molested at the preschool hysteria followed 
after police asked parents to check their children for signs of 
molestation hundreds of parents reported their children were 
victims and tots were rushed to the institute for interviews 
therapists decided more than 100 probably had been molested 
everyone agreed that the children who testified were victims of 
the long litigation 
those kids cannot be mcmartin kids for the rest of their 
lives prosecutor joseph martinez said after jurors deadlocked in 
buckeys second trial friday its been a horrible experience 
but some parents would not give up 
my child was not called as a witness in either trial robert 
salas said and that was one of the things wrong in the case the 
case was flawed from the beginning 
for district attorney ira reiner the case became an albatross 
it is believed to have cost him the democratic nomination for state 
attorney general 
his predecessor robert philibosian who filed the original 
mcmartin case called the outcome a political disaster for 
reiner 
buckeys lawyer danny davis has said he may leave the practice 
of law and devote himself to helping children he has called buckey 
an american hero and the most courageous client ive ever had 
the privilege of serving 
he said he would not file civil lawsuits against anyone on 
buckeys behalf 
weve lost a lot of faith in the judicial system and i can 
think of nothing worse than for my client to get involved in civil 
litigation he said 
buckey who matured and gained confidence under the publicity 
spotlight now hopes to fade into anonymity 
i would like to be just left alone he said id like to 
move out of the city and find a little fresh air

the united states and its allies in 
southeast asia are in general agreement on policy regarding 
cambodia even if they disagree on some specifics thailands 
foreign minister said saturday 
the thai official siddhi savetsila said the fundamental 
objectives of the association of southeast asian nations and the 
united states on cambodia are the same 
we are at one on comprehensive political solution and we both 
agree on the urgent need for the cambodian supreme national council 
to be established at the earliest opportunity siddhi said 
he spoke at aseans annual meeting with its largest trading 
partners the united states japan canada the european community 
australia and new zealand 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the meeting friday 
that we are drawn together by converging interests in matters 
of security economics democracy and human rights 
when it comes to specifics however the united states and asean 
have not held identical positions on cambodia 
the asean countries thailand singapore the philippines 
brunei malaysia and indonesia were jolted by bakers 
announcement earlier this month that the united states was 
withdrawing its recognition of the un seat held by the 
threemember cambodia resistance coalition 
the coalition includes the khmer rouge which is blamed for 
killing hundreds of thousands of cambodians when it ruled the 
country from 197578 the khmer rouge backed by china now is the 
strongest member of the resistance coalition 
baker said washington would open talks with vietnam the main 
backer of the cambodian government in phnom penh and possibly with 
phnom penh itself to try to end the fighting 
asean organized the resistance coalition in 1982 with us 
support and it has been the cornerstone of asean policy toward 
cambodia since then 
baker said continued support for the coalition in the un 
general assembly is only providing the khmer rouge diplomatic 
cover for its military maneuvers 
the united states and asean agree that a supreme national 
council of individuals representing a broad spectrum of opinion 
should be formed to hold cambodias un seat and embody the 
countrys sovereignty until elections can be organized under un 
auspices 
an earlier asean plan would have the council comprise 
representatives of the communist khmer rouge and other members of 
the coalition noncommunist followers of prince norodom sihanouk 
and anticommunists under former premier son sann plus the phnom 
penh government 
also at the asean meeting the european commission announced it 
would set up a comprehensive program for repatriation of 
indochinese refugees 
the announcement said the program would help provide a safe and 
orderly return for those who fled to crowded makeshift camps it 
also said it would try to help improve conditions in vietnam and 
continue to help with costs for the camps in firstasylum countries

nearly 400000 moslems make the 
caribbean their home but most are east indians who disdain the 
radical politics of black moslems like those who are holding 
trinidads government hostage 
saturday black moslem abu bakr took over parliament and 
threatened to kill the prime minister and much of his cabinet 
bakr is a fundamentalist who has developed strong support from 
trinidads poor black community his jamaat almuslimeen sect has 
an eightacre commune in western portofspain where more than 250 
men women and children live there is a large mosque day care 
center school and kitchens for the homeless 
bakr has close ties with libya and has often stated that islamic 
principles must dominate society 
but few east indian moslems support views like bakrs and 
tensions between moslems of east indian and african descent two 
groups that rarely mix have been high 
many east indians consider the black moslems political 
opportunists inspired more by the black power movement than by 
traditional islam stokely carmichael the black power advocate of 
the 1960s in the united states was born in trinidad 
among the regions political leaders prominent moslems include 
east indian president noor hassanali of trinidad and prime minister 
hamilton green of guyana a black who converted to islam in the 
1960s 
the first moslems came to the region to work in the sugar cane 
fields either as black slaves in the 1700s or as indentured 
servants from india 100 years later 
now domed mosques can be found on a dozen caribbean islands but 
the heaviest concentrations of moslems are on the islands of 
trinidad and tobago and in guyana and suriname on the south 
american mainland 
one of the regions strongest religious trends today is the 
movement toward islam among blacks says freelance writer larry 
luxner who lives in san juan in the last 20 years many blacks 
have converted to islam 
luxner who has written extensively on moslems in the caribbean 
estimates that trinidadtobago and suriname each have 100000 
moslems and guyana 120000 
trinidad and tobago is mostly a hindu and christian nation of 
13 million people about 6 percent of the population is moslem 
with those of east indian and african descent each make up 40 
percent of the moslem population 
writing in the arabic magazine aramco world in 1987 luxner said 
trinidad had 85 mosques guyana 133 and suriname formerly dutch 
guyana 150 he said 25 percent of surinames 400000 people were 
moslem the highest percentage in any country in the western 
hemisphere 
there are also 2500 moslems in puerto rico most of them 
palestinians who arrived between 1958 and 1962 luxner said

a jury ordered alamo rentacar 
inc to pay a man 3 million for false arrest after the company 
reported the car he had rented and returned as stolen 
a broward county circuit court jury awarded dania businessman 
michael mancusi 300000 in compensatory damages and 27 million 
in punitive damages friday for malicious prosecution 
the night i was standing in jail i knew it was wrong 
mancusi said saturday big corporations like this should not be 
able to swoop down and sweep people off the streets and put them in 
jail 
the case began when mancusi rented an oldsmobile calais from the 
fort lauderdalebased company for a week on july 15 1986 he kept 
the car longer but didnt think there would be a problem because he 
had rented cars from alamo before on a monthtomonth basis 
he said he received a letter demanding the cars return three 
weeks later and a company employee agreed to an extension over the 
telephone 
but mancusi said he was called by a police detective aug 27 and 
told the car had been listed on a hot sheet of stolen cars 
he said he returned the car that same day 
but on sept 2 an alamo employee signed an autotheft arrest 
affidavit and mancusi was taken to jail 14 days later 
during booking mancusis name was spelled incorrectly on jail 
records leaving him in limbo behind bars when relatives tried to 
bail him out because there was no record of him under the correct 
spelling 
he spent a total of 28 hours behind bars and was subjected to 
two rectal examinations for contraband 
the case went to trial in february 1987 but after it was 
explained in court the judge ordered prosecutors to drop the 
charges 
alamo attorney bob merchin blamed police and prosecutors for 
proceeding with the criminal case 
michael mancusi may have suffered some indignities but that 
was not the fault of alamo merchin said 
mancusi who owns a company that makes commercials and corporate 
and travel videos didnt see it that way and pressed his civil 
case 
obviously its a nice award but i spent a lot of time in 
jail and i had a lot of anguish between the time of the arrest and 
trial so i thought it was a very fair award he said 
i dont rent from alamo any more he added

the nations governors gathered saturday for 
their annual summer meeting voicing bipartisan opposition to a 
bush administration plan to limit deductibility of state income 
taxes 
the deductibility of state and local taxes should not be 
further eroded said iowa gov terry branstad a republican and 
chairman of the national governors association 
he said republican and democratic governors were united in 
opposition the proposal by the bush administration and 
congressional republicans to raise more federal revenue by reducing 
the ability of taxpayers to deduct state and local tax payments 
from their federal tax bill 
republicans were wary however of talk among democratic 
governors of offering a resolution or other statement condemning 
the deepening savings and loan scandals and perhaps suggesting a 
national commission of inquiry 
were viewing it as political positioning said michele 
davis director of the republican governors association 
anticipating a possible democraticled resolution on the 
problem branstad said at a news conference that there was no need 
for partisan fingerpointing on the sampl issue but that there may 
be regional blame 
this is one farm state governor that resents having to pay the 
bill for the high rollers in other states who were trying to line 
their own pockets and help their buddies branstad said and 
its both parties that have been involved in helping in this 
effort and i dont think it makes a lot of sense to point the 
partisan finger 
branstad said he was madder than hell about being asked to pay 
for that because i went through the agriculture crisis in the 
mid80s i had millions of people in my state that suffered 
greatly we didnt get a lot of sympathy through that time and i 
dont like the idea of paying the bills for the extravagance of 
those people involved in the sampl crisis 
the first official session of the governors annual meeting was 
sunday the host city of mobile placed metal crowdcontrol 
barricades along downtown sidewalks in case of protests though few 
were expected and the city planted new palm trees along the route 
from the airport 
the governors planned to discuss a wide range of issues before 
their meeting ends tuesday including a report on implementing the 
education goals they agreed on with president bush last fall 
democratic governors met privately saturday in nearby 
pascagoula miss in a home overlooking the gulf of mexico 
democratic gov bill clinton of arkansas said the democrats were 
trying to reach a position on a sampl policy 
the governors stated their opposition to the latest proposal on 
taxes in a letter to the administration before the meeting 
the bipartisan national governors association has a 
longstanding policy against such a move spokeswoman rae bond said 
the governors argue that limiting or eliminating deductibility 
in addition to raising federal taxes for individuals who itemize 
their deductions would make it more difficult for states to raise 
additional revenues to provide new services and might lead to 
increased pressure to lower state and local taxes 
the governors also dislike any proposals to raise federal excise 
taxes viewing that as an infringement on state and local tax bases 
the governors are very apprehensive about anything that would 
reduce the flexibility of states to be able to deal with their own 
situation in terms of revenue sources that are traditionally the 
states branstad said 
a group of northeastern governors sent a letter of their own to 
federal budget negotiators saying the move would cause the federal 
income tax to become a tax on a tax and would especially hit 
northeastern states where 18 percent of the national population 
pays 30 percent of all state and local personal and property taxes 
it would strike especially hard at middle and workingclass 
families they said as a region the northeast is already 
suffering from the disproportionate impact of the savings and loan 
bailout 
the tax idea emerged late last week from negotiations on a 
federal budget solution under the gop plan the currently 
unlimited deduction for state and local taxes would be limited to 
10000 administration officials estimated the plan would generate 
3 billion a year in federal revenue 
in addition federal budget negotiators are discussing raising 
the federal excise tax on beer and other alcoholic beverages 
generating 72 billion 
several democratic governors were considering offering proposals 
on the savingsandloan costs including richard celeste of ohio 
michael dukakis of massachusetts and douglas wilder of virginia 
one plan circulated by wilder would call for a national 
commission to investigate the collapse of savings and loans that 
threaten to cost federal taxpayers as much as 300 billion or more 
in bailout costs 
on education a disagreement emerged over the makeup of a 
commission that would issue report cards on how states are doing in 
meeting their education goals an administration plan to have four 
seats each named by the administration the governors and congress 
would leave it dominated 8 to 4 by republicans and was being 
opposed by democrats who feared it could become a partisan weapon 
that has been a very sensitive area branstad acknowledged 
clinton said house speaker tom foley and senate majority leader 
george mitchell have written the governors suggesting the 
commission be established by an act of congress clinton said the 
governors hadnt decided on a response id say well all get a 
bad grade or somebody will get a bad grade if this report card 
business isnt up and running pretty soon after this meeting 
clinton said

the bush administrations proposal to increase 
taxes on alcoholic beverages would cost the average american family 
101 a year with the greatest burden falling on the poor 
congressional analysts say 
the proposal which would cost drinkers 72 billion a year is 
part of the second deficitreduction tax increase offered by the 
administration this year the new package has yet to be agreed to 
by republican congressional leaders let alone by top democrats 
who are trying to negotiate deficit cuts of more than 50 billion 
for next year 
under the proposal the 198 federal tax on a fifth of 80proof 
vodka would rise to 254 for the first time in almost 40 years 
taxes on beer and wine would be raised as well so that an ounce of 
drinking alcohol would be taxed at 25 cents regardless of the form 
that would boost the 16cent tax on a sixpack of beer to 81 
cents and the 3cent tax on table wine to 76 cents the tax on 
other forms of wine which is based on alcohol content would go up 
accordingly 
analysts say the impact would be felt most by those with the 
lowest incomes simply because they tend to spend a greater share 
of their earnings on alcohol than do the more affluent 
according to the congressional budget office the 20 percent of 
americans with the lowest incomes averaging 8228 after taxes 
spend 308 a year or 37 percent on liquor wine and beer the top 
onefifth with aftertax incomes averaging 77622 spend about 
1210 or 16 percent 
a second new element of the administration plan would target 
upperincome americans for the first time it would limit the 
federal deduction for state and local income taxes to 10000 per 
couple or individual and raise up to 3 billion a year 
figures from the joint committee on taxation indicate that the 
86 percent of taxpayers with incomes under 50000 a year would pay 
only 02 percent of that tax increase couples and individuals in 
the 50000to75000 range would pay 05 percent those between 
75000 and 100000 19 percent and those making 10000 to 
200000 would pay 112 percent of the increase 
those earning more than 200000 would pay 862 percent of the 
3 billion 
anything falling so disproportionately on the welltodo usually 
is inclined to be endorsed by democrats but not this idea it 
didnt take long for them to figure out that limiting the deduction 
of income taxes would make it more difficult for states to raise 
those taxes 
the nations governors condemned the plan iowa gov terry 
branstad a republican and chairman of the national governors 
association said saturday the deductibility of state and local 
taxes should not be further eroded 
branstad speaking in mobile ala at the governors annual 
summer meeting said governors of both parties were united in 
opposition to the proposal 
fortyone states have a personal income tax in most it is the 
prime source of revenue 
the irs has no current estimate on how many couples and 
individuals claim a deduction of over 10000 for state and local 
income taxes however on returns filed in 1989 the 46 percent of 
taxpayers who itemized deductions claimed a writeoff averaging only 
about 3800 for income and property taxes combined the proposal 
would not affect the deduction of property taxes 
while the welltodo would have to swallow most of that 3 
billion tax increase as a group they would come out ahead when the 
entire administration package is considered 
that is because the most contentious element of the plan is the 
same as when president bush sent it to congress last january a 
reduction in the tax on capital gains which are profits from the 
sale of stock and other investments 
bush contends the reduction would prompt so much economic 
activity that investors actually would pay 49 billion more in 
taxes in 1991 and still more in ever year in the future 
democrats agree the cut would boost collections in one year but 
say it quickly would become a drain on the treasury but their 
opposition is rooted in another factor more than 80 percent of the 
tax cut would go to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
about half the 50 billionplus deficit reduction proposed by 
the administration for next year would come from tax increases 
including user fees and the cut in capitalgains taxes

states should move away from the arbitrary 
grouping of students by age governors said saturday in a report 
that criticizes assembly line teaching 
the recommendation is one of several in the report being offered 
at the national governors associations annual meeting in mobile 
ala the report outlines the strategy for meeting the educational 
goals endorsed by president bush and the governors in late february 
the strategy was developed by the nga task force on education 
cochaired by govs bill clinton of arkansas and carroll campbell 
of south carolina 
despite all the effort that has been made in the decade of the 
80s to invest more money start new programs and raise standards 
we still face a crisis clinton said in mobile ala where the 
governors gathered to open their annual conference 
we are still a long way from meeting these goals we still 
havent made fundamental and dramatic changes in the very design 
and structure of the education system clinton said 
but we first have to face the fact that we still have problems 
with the attitudes of the citizens whose votes and opinions 
will determine whether we can make the changes we must make 
the proposals will be discussed this week at the governors 
plenary session 
the task force report criticized elementary and secondary 
schools for assigning students based on where they live grouping 
them according to age and narrowly defined ability and offering 
them curriculum and textbooks that are fragmented and 
repetitive 
the present system requires too many teachers who focus 
largely on the mastery of discrete lowlevel skills and isolated 
facts the report said by doing so the report says the system 
denies opportunities for students to master subject matter in 
depth learn more complex problemsolving skills or apply the 
skills they do learn 
this arrangement was designed to prepare a work force destined 
for the assembly lines of the industrial age the report says 
the task force suggested that states rely on practices that 
expand rather than limit access to learning opportunities for 
lowachieving students said the report 
the report noted that age grading and fixed school years 
could be detrimental to those preschool and younger children not 
making adequate progress 
states should consider other approaches such as upgraded early 
primary programs multiage grouping or summer programs that allow 
children to progress at their own rate and still meet performance 
standards said the report 
other specific recommendations include placing top priority on 
developing new tools for assessing student performance 
the governors report said that portfolios essays or other 
openended problems that require students to synthesize integrate 
and apply knowledge and data need to be developed as alternatives 
to the exclusive use of conventional multiplechoice tests 
the task force also asked states to conduct a statewide literacy 
assessment and asked employers to audit the literacy and other 
skills of their own employees 
shirley mcbay president of the quality education for minorities 
network praised the strategies and underscored the governors 
recommendation to eliminate tracking and ability grouping 
they have recognized as did we that nothing short of 
restructuring the nations educational system will do and that a 
holistic coordinated approach is required said mcbay 
the national education association a few weeks earlier called 
for elimination of academic tracking stressing that the practice 
keeps underachievers down and lumps minorities into classes that 
can prevent them from realizing their potential 
the american federation of teachers however complained the 
strategies fail to specify the role the federal government should 
be playing in assisting the states

warring shiite moslem militias fired 
howitzers and multibarrelled rocket launchers in south lebanon on 
saturday at least 16 combatants were killed and 42 wounded police 
said 
ambulances sirens wailing evacuated casualties from the 
battleground in the southern apple province to hospitals in sidon 
security sources said many bodies could not be evacuated because of 
the intensity of the fighting 
the red cross pleaded with fundamentalist proiranian hezbollah 
and the syrianbacked amal militia to abide by a fourhour mercy 
ceasefire sunday to remove the casualties 
the red cross threatened to immediately withdraw from the 
region if the ceasefire was not followed 
police could not establish who was winning ground in the latest 
confrontation which broke out at the hezbollahheld village of 
kfar milki six miles southeast of sidon 
the fighting spread to jarjou on the southwestern edge of 
hezbollahs enclave in the province according to a police 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing regulations 
amal in a statement said its fighters controlled jrinnaya 
hill which overlooks kfar milki on the northwestern edge of the 
hezbollah enclave and were advancing through the deserted village 
hezbollah or party of god said its fighters crushed four 
attacks 
the fundamentalist group accused guerrillas of yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization of direct involvement in the 
attacks against its lines 
arafat has about 1000 guerrillas manning a buffer that 
separates hezbollahs enclave from amalheld territory 
the palestinian deployment has helped block an advance west 
toward the mediterranean coast and south toward the main shiite 
cities by the proiranian group 
amal did not refer to the reported palestinian involvement in 
the fighting the police spokesman said arafats guerrillas have 
sealed off the confrontation zone preventing policemen and news 
reporters from monitoring combat developments 
he said however that four dead palestinian guerrillas and 27 
wounded were evacuated from the kfar milki region to hospitals in 
sidon 
the palestinians are obviously involved in the fighting but 
we cant establish whether they are taking part in ground attacks 
or just participating in the shelling duels with hezbollah 
gunners the police spokesman said 
plo officials in sidon and palestinian refugee camps on the 
outskirts of the port city refused to comment on the fighting 
saturday 
amal and hezbollah have been locked in a threeyear intermittent 
confrontation for dominance of the 12 million shiites lebanons 
largest sect 
by police count the power struggle has killed 1202 shiites and 
wounded 4131 
amal calls hezbollah incursions into apple province an iranian 
invasion charging that the 2000member iranian revolutionary 
guards contingent in lebanon was involved 
the command of the revolutionary guards contingent in lebanon 
broke its usual silence saturday to defend its role in lebanon 
saying it was only aimed at fighting the zionists israel and 
defending the moslems 
the statement published by the leftist newspaper assafir 
called on amal and hezbollah to end the fighting among brethren 
and unite your guns against the zionist enemy 
the iranian troops came to lebanon with the declared objective 
of taking part in confronting israels invasion in 1982 they set 
up headquarters in the east lebanons town of baalbek and have 
since trained most of hezbollahs fighters 
in another development the government of president elias hrawi 
announced saturday it will take the proper measures to end a 
rebellion by gen michel aoun he leads a rival administration in 
the countrys christian enclave 
the governments statement issued after a fourhour cabinet 
meeting did not elaborate beirut newspapers predicted the 
government steps include the imposition of an economic blockade of 
that part of the christian enclave controlled by aoun 
aoun the former army commander battled syrian forces last year 
in an unsuccessful effort to drive them from lebanon that fighting 
left at least 900 people dead and 3000 wounded 
earlier this year aouns soldiers battled a rival christian 
militia for control of the countrys christian enclave those 
battles ended in a standoff

steel corp 75 million to settle legal actions against him by the 
company and its creditors a federal court officer said 
the case between posner and sharon steel with assets of at 
least 500 million was the secondlargest trusteeship case in the 
nation 
fw agnew the bankruptcy court trustee overseeing sharon 
steels reorganization announced the tentative agreement with 
posner on friday 
besides paying the 75 million posner will relinquish his 
controlling share of stock in the company and he and his affiliated 
companies will give up claims of 55 million against sharon steel 
he is giving up all ownership claims and every interest 
whatsoever larry palmer chief counsel to the trustee said 
saturday 
posner was chairman president and chief executive officer of 
sharon steel until he was ousted during the companys bankruptcy 
reorganization 
the creditors said posner mismanaged the company and drained its 
assets among other things they charged that he used 44 million 
of sharon steel money to pay his legal fees in a federal tax 
evasion trial in florida in which he was convicted in september 
1987 
the value of the settlement is not only the money but in 
making him go away palmer said of posner

the tentative agreement was reached wednesday in pittsburgh in a 
hearing before us district court judge donald ziegler according 
to agnew who was involved in the negotiations 
it must be approved in a joint hearing with ziegler and us 
bankruptcy court judge warren bentz to be scheduled in late 
september agnew said 
according to palmer the case involving sharon steel was the 
second largest trusteeship case next to the eastern airlines case 
sharon steel filed in 1987 for protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws and a trustee was 
appointed 
it was an economic shambles when we took over palmer said 
posners affiliated companies dwg corp nvf co pennsylvania 
engineering corp and their subsidiaries and affiliates joined in 
the agreement palmer said 
in may a new york investors group filed a plan to bring sharon 
steel out of bankruptcy proceedings 
the investors the new york merchant bank castle harlan inc and 
quantum fund an investment fund said they plan to contribute 65 
million to the companys pension plan which would eliminate all 
back payments required by the pension benefit guaranty corp 
howard clark president of local 1197 of the united 
steelworkers said saturday that 2200 workers at sharon steel in 
farrell have a tentative contract with castle harlan 
the contract would take effect if the investors group is allowed 
to buy and reorganize sharon steel he said

a military judge sentenced a us navy 
lieutenant to seven years in prison saturday after convicting him 
of raping a female officer aboard ship at a spanish port 
the judge capt thomas a lawrence also dismissed lt jg 
robin e brown 27 of rawlins wyo from the navy 
lawrence said he hoped the sentence would express the naval 
communitys moral outrage and indignation that such a sexual 
attack could take place against one of its female officers 
navy officials in spain said they could recall no previous case 
in which a male officer had been accused of raping a female 
officer they said cases of shipboard rape are extremely rare 
i think the judge did a good job of letting it be known that 
this wont be allowed in the navy on ships or anywhere else 
said the rape victim who stressed that she did not hold the navy 
responsible for what happened the navy has withheld the womans 
name and rank to protect her privacy 
browns defense attorneys said they planned to appeal his 
conviction and sentence 
he was accused of raping the female officer on april 4 aboard 
the uss suribachi while the ammunition ship was docked in 
cartagena spain prosecutors said the rape occurred after brown 
and the victim had gone drinking in town with fellow officers from 
the ship 
on friday the judge found brown guilty of one count of rape 
under the military code of justice defense lawyers chose to have 
the judge hear the case rather than a jury of six officers 
the judge accepted the prosecutions contention that brown 
returned to the ship drunk and entered the womans stateroom 
getting into her bed while she was asleep and initiating sexual 
intercourse 
brown who is married and has a 1yearold daughter did not 
testify during the weeklong trial but took the stand saturday at 
his sentencing hearing 
he said he believed he committed the crime should be punished 
and apologized to the victim 
im very sorry for all the harm i caused your family said 
brown im very ashamed of what ive done i never intended to 
harm anybody i wish you guys could forgive me 
in her testimony saturday the victim said she and her family 
had suffered deep anguish as a result of the rape 
he violated me physically she said i was in my 
stateroom which is my home and i should be left alone there if i 
cant sleep in my own bed where can i be left alone 
browns defense attorney marine capt jh drescher admitted 
that brown had sexual intercourse but said his client was drunk at 
the time and may have believed the female officer had indicated her 
consent while semiconscious by making a gesture to encourage brown 
at the sentencing hearing drescher asked for a oneyear 
sentence telling the judge that brown is not an evil man 
but he was too weak to say no 
the prosecutor marine capt walter sharp asked for a prison 
sentence of 12 to 15 years saying brown had committed an act of 
selfish selfgratification 
brown displayed no emotion as the judge declared the sentence 
he will receive reduced pay during his confinement and lose all pay 
and benefits upon his release 
browns trial has drawn attention because complaints of sexual 
harassment and discrimination in the navy have increased in recent 
years as the number of women enlistees has grown from 9000 in 1972 
to the current 64000 
the service has come under particular scrutiny after a female 
midshipman resigned in april from the us naval academy in 
annapolis md after she was handcuffed to a urinal and 
photographed by some male classmates in a hazing incident in 
december 
the incident prompted the academys superintendent to institute 
a new program of sensitivity training for midshipmen that focuses 
on sexual harassment and equal opportunity for women 
brown will be held in the brig at the joint usspanish naval 
station in rota before being transferred to a military prison in 
the united states

a program to let poor milwaukee public 
school pupils enroll in private schools at state expense could 
disrupt the racial balance in the states largest school system an 
attorney argued in court saturday 
patrick mcdonnell an assistant city attorney for milwaukee 
told a dane county circuit court judge that the states school 
choice program could cause the entire milwaukee public schools 
system to become more rather than less segregated 
but an attorney representing six parents and six of the private 
schools favoring the program said school choice creates a new 
educational opportunity and gives parents more control over their 
childrens education 
judge susan steingass heard testimony from about a halfdozen 
attorneys in two lawsuits against the program which is scheduled 
to start next month 
under the program the first of its kind in the nation the 
state would provide 2500 per pupil for lowincome families who 
want to transfer a child from the milwaukee public schools to a 
nonsectarian private school it was approved in april and signed 
into law by republican gov tommy g thompson 
the primary lawsuit on which judge steingass is expected to 
rule next week claims the program is unconstitutional for 
providing state dollars to private schools 
it was filed against the state by the wisconsin education 
association council wisconsins largest teachers union the union 
is among several education groups that oppose the program along 
with state superintendent herbert grover saying it undermines 
public education because private schools cannot be held as 
accountable as public schools 
what the legislature did is ignore 25 years of history of 
desegregating milwaukee public schools mcdonnell said 
contending the exodus of students in some areas could upset the 
ratios of white and black students in the citys federallyordered 
desegregation plan 
robert friebert representing the milwaukee chapter of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people and 
three statewide school groups said the legislature failed to 
include in the law means for the state to monitor the progress of 
the programs pupils 
you cant have the public funds without the public controls 
under the public purpose doctrine in the wisconsin constitution 
friebert said 
landmark legal foundation center attorney clint bolick whose 
washingtonbased group is representing the parents and private 
schools said the school choice plan creates a new educational 
opportunity which the legislature is allowed to do under the state 
constitution 
it transfers power in the area of public education from the 
educational establishment to the parents bolick said 
the plan was a step in equalizing educational opportunities for 
poor pupils with those of wealthier pupils bolick said 
warren weinstein an assistant attorney general representing the 
state said it was not unconstitutional for the program to receive 
state funding 
weinstein said the law calls for scrutiny by superintendent 
grover and an audit by the legislative audit bureau by 1995 
the second lawsuit filed by landmark legal foundation against 
grover claimed the school superintendent was illegally trying to 
force private schools in the program to meet complex and strict 
requirements not spelled out in the law

one bottle contained 54 grams of dissolved cocaine and the other 
had nearly 37 grams said fda spokeswoman estela brown the other 
bottles contained untainted beverage the drink pony malta de 
bavaria is similar to a heavy nonalcoholic beer 
it was not known how much cocaine menendez had consumed ms 
fernandez said she said 25 milligrams would constitute a lethal 
dose 
menendez noticed a strange taste to the drink after swallowing 
she said telling his father there was poison in it and to take 
him to the hospital 
after menendez was stricken thursday the fda ordered the drink 
removed from the shelves of the miami supermarket where he 
purchased it 
additional tests on pony malta de bavaria taken from the 
supermarket and other stores are planned before a decision is made 
on any further recall said ms brown 
the drink is manufactured by cerveceria bavaria sa based in 
bogota colombia company president augusto lopez said saturday the 
drink is produced both there and in barranquilla colombia and is 
shipped abroad by independent exporters 
lopez said he had no information about those exporters adding 
that the brewery has nothing to do with the drink once it is sold 
in colombia 
customs spokesman michael sheehan said cocaine smuggling in 
liquid form is a common trick among drug traffickers 
weve seen dozens of cases of liquefied cocaine he said 
weve seen cocaine dissolved in wine water all sorts of ways 
sheehan said one smuggling ring filled clear plastic bags with a 
cocaine solution and placed them inside larger bags of water 
containing tropical fish from latin america 
other traffickers have soaked towels and clothing in solutions 
of cocaine he said

will die of aids in the 1990s a medical journal reported saturday 
the report published in the londonbased journal the lancet 
said aids has become the leading cause of death for women ages 20 
to 40 in many places including new york city and central african 
cities 
in these cities infant and child mortality could be as much 
as 30 percent greater than what would otherwise have been 
expected the report said which cited figures from the world 
health organization 
during the 1990s not only can hundreds of thousands of 
pediatric aids cases be expected but also more than a million 
uninfected children will be orphaned because their hivinfected 
mothers and fathers will have died from aids 
the hiv virus causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome a 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system and leaves victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers there is 
no known cure 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact other 
means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or 
blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
or syringes by drug abusers aids can also be passed from mother to 
child at or before birth 
the report in lancet said genevabased who estimates that during 
the 1980s there were about 500000 cases of aids in women and 
children 
during the 1990s who estimates that the pandemic will kill an 
additional 3 million or more women and children worldwide the 
report said 
the report in the lancet was written by who researcher james 
chin he said the estimates cited had been developed by whos 
global program on aids 
chins report entitled current and future dimensions of the 
hivaids pandemic in women and children gave no estimate of aids 
deaths among males in the 1990s 
but who last year estimated that a total of 6 million people 
were likely to have aids worldwide by the year 2000 
saturdays report said that during the second half of the 1980s 
hiv infections among homosexual and bisexual men have shown a 
decreasing trend in most areas of the world 
by contrast there has been a slow but steady increase in hiv 
infections among heterosexual populations this trend has been most 
pronounced in latin america especially in the caribbean it said

about 30 ku klux klansmen and neonazis 
rallied and marched down this exclusive retreats most famous 
street saturday to jeers from a crowd of about 1000 people 
the marchers split between klansmen and young neonazis walked 
down worth avenue past royal palms manicured hedges and pastel 
shops many of them closed 
about 130 officers from six police departments most in riot 
gear and carrying batons closely monitored the march in an area 
that includes many survivors of the nazi holocaust 
the 45minute event proceeded with little incident although the 
presence of hoods shaven heads and swastikas turned what had 
seemed a typical blend of tourists shoppers and rubberneckers into 
a jeering mob 
a spectator was arrested for disorderly conduct during the 
march said police spokesman craig gunkel after the march police 
intervened when a group of people chased down a marcher and tried 
to wrestle an american flag away from him 
the crowd included legions of news photographers and reporters 
and police spent much of their energy controlling photographers 
several of whom complained they were struck 
the city had tried to block the event but the klan won a july 2 
ruling from us district judge norman roettger in west palm beach 
allowing it the march had been planned for july 4 but klan 
leaders said the ruling didnt give them time to organize it by 
then 
the march started almost an hour late after the white 
supremacists seemed to have trouble gathering their troops 
many of them got lost explained rally organizer richard 
ford a klan wizard from lantana 
william wild bill gandall a palm beach county retiree with 
an eye patch and crutches tried to stop the march before it began 
he hobbled out and threw his body on the street but was carted 
off asking for his heart medicine and muttering i had to try to 
stop it 
the symbols that brought the most anger were nazi swastikas and 
salutes which infuriated older jewish onlookers 
this is a fringe psychotic element preaching hate and 
destruction said boca raton retiree stanley winter 
wendell baker a 25yearold black attending the rally said he 
was unhappy at the amount of exposure given the march which he 
described as a publicity stunt 
the marchers gathered at memorial fountain across from the 
police station shouting racial epithets giving nazi salutes and 
castigating race traitors 
ford defended the right of the neonazis to be there with his 
fraternal white knights and other klan groups but was almost 
apologetic in an aside to reporters 
theyre more racist than we are he explained as young 
jackbooted militants baited the jeering crowd 
walter and pat carlson two of fords neighbors attended the 
rally and described him as a regular guy friendly with 
neighbors of all races 
hes not the kind of guy looking to firebomb a church said 
walter carlson 
in a statement issued wednesday the klan said it was holding 
the event in palm beach because the city has long been a symbol 
of the power and influence of white chrisitians and is now seeing 
that culture subjugated by a vocal liberalminority coalition 
a counterdemonstration in palm beach was scheduled sunday by the 
rev thomas masters of the new macedonia baptist church in nearby 
riviera beach and jewish leader lynn kesselman

filled with explicit and detailed verbal descriptions or narrative 
accounts of sexual excitement or sexual conduct along with timely 
moaning and groaning that they violate contemporary community 
standards of obscenity and are harmful to children 
in texas dallas assistant district attorney david pickett said 
the lyrics of the rap album are obscene under the texas penal code

heres a brief look at pertinent 
facts about mongolia 
geography mongolia is a landlocked country of about 600000 
square miles of rolling grassland and mountains its highest point 
is in the altai mountains in the west which rise 14420 feet 
average rainfall is only eight inches a year with the gobi desert 
in the south getting as little as 24 inches 
people mongolias population was estimated at 2 million in 
1988 most are ethnic mongols but a tiny minority are khazak 
russian and other minorities one quarter of mongolians live in the 
capital city ulan bator and half live in rural areas mostly 
engaged in herding few true nomads remain but many people are 
seminomadic moving with their herds between winter and summer 
camps 
history genghis khan united the scattered nomadic mongol 
tribes in the 13th century and turned them into a conquering horde 
at its peak the mongol empire he founded claimed territory from 
the danube river in europe to chinas pacific coast the manchus 
ousted the mongols as rulers of china in 1691 the mongols ruled 
mongolia until 1921 a small band of revolutionaries aided by 
soviet troops revolted that year and proclaimed an independent 
socialist state in northern or outer mongolia the southern party 
inner mongolia remained part of china mongolia remained in the 
soviet bloc and began its recent moves toward political and 
economic reform only after moscow did 
economy the economy centers around herding and developing 
natural resources such as copper molybdenum and timber with 25 
million head of livestock mongolia exports wool leather and meat 
less than 1 percent of the land is cultivated the economy is 
centrally planned and major industries are statesubsidized 
mongolia receives substantial aid and investment from the soviet 
union but in april 1990 approved a joint venture law intended to 
encourage investment from japan and the west 
government after nearly seven decades of monopoly the 
communists bowed to popular demonstrations earlier this year and 
legalized other parties however the communist party formally 
called the mongolian peoples revolutionary party has 98000 
members and far outnumbers the opposition the secondlargest party 
is the mongolian democratic party with a declared membership of 
7200 the communists have promised to stop receiving state funds

to the polls sunday to vote in this sovietbloc countrys first 
multiparty elections that will decide the pace of democratic and 
freemarket reforms 
at high school no 1 in ulan bator election officials showed 
observers from various parties that the ballot boxes were empty 
when voting began they then used string and sealing wax to secure 
the boxes 
voters most wearing the traditional mongolian herders dress 
began arriving just after the polls opened at 7 am 
from the start it is going quite well said amarbayasgolam 
an observer from the mongolian democratic party the largest 
opposition party two british election observers also were on hand 
among 19 from various countries 
five new parties are challenging the ruling communists formally

nation since 1921 are assured control of the national legislature 
the 430seat great peoples hural after winning a primary election 
july 22 the opposition parties only have 130 candidates still in 
the running out of an original 338 
but the opposition hopes to win in the new 53seat small hural 
which will meet between the great hurals annual sessions and have 
considerable power its seats will be allocated to parties 
according to the results of a party preference poll that is 
included on sundays ballot 
at stake are the speed and boldness of political and economic 
reforms which street demonstrations last winter and spring forced 
the communists to accept 
by agreeing to free elections the ruling party added mongolia 
to the list of sovietbloc nations experimenting with democracy 
though the reform movement has swept through eastern europe 
mongolia is the first asian communist state to hold multiparty 
elections 
however the opposition has accused the communists of only 
paying lipservice to reform in order to stay in power they and 
ordinary mongolians also have complained that the election is not 
fair because greater weight is given to rural votes expected to 
favor the communists they also complain that nominations were made 
before all the parties were able to register 
in the election district where high school no 1 is located 
however the mongolian democratic partys candidate a 31yearold 
rock star is favored to win a great hural seat tsogtsaikhan a 
singer and guitarist for the group honkh finished first in the 
primary in that district 
chultemtsuren a 75yearold retired official who wore world war 
ii medals said he voted for the rock star asked why he didnt 
vote for the communist candidate he said i worry about the 
future of the country thats why i vote for a younger man 
chultemtsuren like most mongolians uses only one name 
mongolias generally lowkey campaign went into high gear on 
saturday as candidates made the rounds nationwide in a final effort 
to get out the vote 
more than 4000 youths rallied in the evening in front of the 
lenin museum in ulan bator to cheer candidates for the mongolian 
democratic party and listen to honkh and other rock groups 
i am a permanent fighter for democracy declared dorligjav 
the partys deputy chairman we will fight not only for the 
election but beyond for political change 
the crowd waved the partys blue banners and joined in singing 
honkhs biggest hit a song that urges mongolians to wake up 
the sound of the bell 
in one shantytown district in western ulan bator an elderly 
buddhist monk who is running for the great hural led residents in 
dedicating a hilltop shrine saturday afternoon they erected a 
stone carved with the picture of a goddess and placed gifts of 
yogurt and candy before it 
local residents said the hill had been an informal place of 
prayer before the communists virtually banned worship in the 1930s 
religious freedom was one of the demands of the prodemocracy 
demonstrators and believers have begun reopening temples on their 
own in the past few months 
as the group dispersed a campaign worker called out vote for 
the national progressives the party to which the monk dagva 
belongs 
the national progressives also have a candidate in one of the 
elections most dramatic races one of their founding members a 
29yearold lawyer named ganbold is facing the chairman of the 
communist party gombojavyn ochirbat in a race for the great hural 
ochirbat 61 took office in march after the demonstrations 
forced his predecessor jambyn batmonh to resign he has embraced 
reform but also stresses moderation and maintaining order the 
national progressives favor rapid privatization and establishment 
of laws to guarantee freedoms 
ganbolds campaign workers handed out the candidates platform 
and pictures of genghis khan the 13thcentury warrior who built a 
great mongol empire

a threemilelong column of 16000 peasants 
marched to the governing party headquarters saturday to back their 
demands for land reform 
this is the only way we can open the doors of the agricultural 
sector agencies and the only way theyll take us into account and 
provide solutions to our problems protest leader cesar del angel 
was quoted as saying by the independent excelsior news service 
the marchers arrived at the office complex of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party in downtown mexico city after a 
sixday trek from the state of veracruz on the gulf of mexico 
they are demanding 200000 acres of land in the state 
they said the government promised the lnd in an oct 16 written 
agreement with their organization the national movement of 400 
communities the official news agency notimex reported the 
movement is affiliated with the governing party 
the agreement between the government and the peasants reportedly 
calls for the breaking up of more than 210 large landholdings in 
veracruz which would then be parceled out to farm families 
protesters also demanded a settlement of about 11 million for 
lands lost in the development of a lake in the state of mexico 
notimex said 
it has been government policy since the 19101920 revolution to 
eliminate big wealthy landholdings and distribute estates among 
landless peasants 
the policy has resulted in tiny mostly inefficient farms worked 
by individual families or owned collectively by villages 
the previous two administrations claimed there were no more big 
landholdings in mexico and further land redistribution would hurt 
productivity

they worked with pipe insulation and cement containing asbestos 
said russell budd a dallas attorney representing the plaintiffs 
the jury found that celotex corp of tampa fla was liable for 
health problems suffered by workers who installed or worked around 
the asbestos products

suffered asbestosrelated injuries that celotex failed to give 
warnings of known asbestos dangers and that the asbestos products 
were unreasonably dangerous 
it showed these people the workers had a progressive lung 
injury that scars the interior of the lungs and ultimately requires 
oxygen therapy budd said 
a man who answered the phone at celotexs houston plant saturday 
said no one would be available for comment until monday and that 
there was no weekend spokesman on duty

china on saturday criticized britains decision 
to grant citizenship to 50000 hong kong families saying it 
violates the spirit of the agreement to return the colony to 
chinese rule in 1997 
however the foreign ministry statement carried by the official 
xinhua news agency was less harsh than in the past 
the measure passed in the british parliament monday it was 
first proposed in december since then the chinese government has 
attacked it repeatedly and angrily 
the plans aim is to prevent an immediate exodus of the colonys 
most talented people by assuring them citizenship at britain they 
could thus be guaranteed a new life in britain at a later date 
saturdays statement said the measure was unacceptable to the 
chinese government and will not be recognized by the chinese 
side 
china threatened to take further measures at an appropriate 
time in response to the erroneous action of the british side it 
did not elaborate 
this move of the british side contravenes the spirit and 
essence of the relevant agreement between china and britain and 
impairs chinas sovereignty the statement said 
britain and china in 1984 signed the agreement to return hong 
kong to china in 1997 when the british lease on the colony runs 
out hong kong is an enclave on the southeastern coast of china 
china has promised that hong kong can retain its freewheeling 
capitalist economy and lifestyle for 50 years after 1997 but 
confidence in chinas promises plummeted after last years army 
crackdown on prodemocracy protestors in beijing 
the milder tone of saturdays statement by china is probably 
part of chinas attempts to mend ties with western nations 
including britain which banned highlevel diplomatic contacts and 
imposed economic sanctions after last years crackdown

the nations top military official 
praised blacks contributions in us wars at a ceremony saturday 
opening construction of a monument to the buffalo soldiers who 
fought in the west 
the buffalo soldier monument will honor all black american 
soldiers said gen colin powell the first black chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
from prerevolutionary times through the revolutionary war 
through every one of our wars and on up to the present black men 
and women have willingly served and died powell said 
but for most of that time blacks served without recognition or 
reward for the contribution they made for our freedom he said 
adding that it was freedom they did not enjoy here in their own 
beloved native land 
the monument is planned for the fort leavenworth grounds near 
smith lake in northeast kansas where the buffalo soldiers of the 
10th regiment once camped between campaigns against indians on the 
great plains 
america has made enormous progress from the days of the 
buffalo soldiers to the days of a black chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff powell said we arent perfect we never will 
be but the beauty of this country is that were always making 
progress 
powell serves as the top military adviser to the president the 
secretary of defense and the national security council 
the 9th and 10th calvary regiments of buffalo soldiers were 
formed by congress in 1866 to patrol the western frontier it was 
the indians who dubbed black men who served in the segregated 
regiments the buffalo soldiers 
in their service from the mid1800s to the early 1900s the 
buffalo soldiers endured discrimination hardships and neglect that 
white regiments didnt have to suffer they protected settlers 
built forts and fought apaches and comanches on the great plains 
and along the texas border 
the monuments design calls for a large bronze statue of a 
riflecarrying buffalo soldier on a horse in the design the 
soldier stands on rocks between two ponds one behind him to 
represent the past and a reflective pool in front to see into the 
future 
water will flow over the rocks into the reflective pool

the mayor of this quebec town said saturday 
that a deal had been struck to sell the federal government a 
disputed parcel of land in the hope of ending an 18dayold armed 
standoff between police and mohawks 
meanwhile indian negotiators met to draw up their response to 
the latest proposals from quebec authorities to end the 
confrontation 
the standoff in oka 18 miles west of montreal began after 
police rushed a barricade set up by the mohawks to stop the 
expansion of the local golf course on land they claim is ancestral 
an officer was killed in the gun battle that followed but it is 
still not clear if he was shot by indians or fellow officers 
the assembly of first nations an indian organization said at 
least 5000 people were expected to take part in a mass rally 
sunday in oka organizers are billing it as the largest indian 
demonstration in canadian history 
demonstrators have been asked to bring flowers to present to the 
police as a symbol of peace 
oka mayor jean ouellette said a deal had been reached friday to 
sell the federal government a 67acre parcel of land that had been 
slated for the golf course expansion town spokesman robert mccoy 
said the proposed purchase price was not disclosed 
the land would be combined with a 30acre tract that ottawas 
indian affairs department plans to buy from a french businessman to 
make a reserve for the kahnesatake mohawk community in oka 
ouellette told more than 100 local residents gathered outside 
the town hall that he would recommend that the town council approve 
the land sale as a special meeting on tuesday mccoy said 
but many in the crowd expressed opposition to the deal accusing 
federal and provincial authorities of giving in to the mohawks at 
their expense 
under the proposed deal the federal government would provide 
compensation to homeowners on or near the land to be sold for use 
as a mohawk reserve and help make up for future lost municipal 
taxes from the acreage mccoy said 
there was no immediate reaction from mohawk representatives to 
the land purchase proposals 
on friday mohawk negotiator mavis etienne shrugged off the 
governments planned purchase of the 30 acres saying no one has 
any business negotiating for our land acting like they are buying 
it when they dont even own it 
mohawk negotiators met saturday behind their barricades in oka 
but had no immediate response to a set of proposals from quebec 
native affairs minister john ciaccia to settle the dispute 
on friday ciaccia said quebec is prepared to withdraw nearly 
all the police from oka and the kahnawake mohawk reserve south of 
montreal the kahnawake indians have blocked the mercier bridge to 
montreal in sympathy with the oka mohawks forcing commuters to 
make long detours 
in return ciaccia proposed that the mohawks withdraw from their 
barricades and turn in their weapons and explosives 
however the provincial official rejected a demand for amnesty 
for those involved in the gun battle with provincial police 
instead ciaccia proposed setting up a commission of inquiry with 
a mohawk representative to investigate the death of the policeman

three gunmen posing as flowerbearing 
mourners at a new york city gang members funeral opened fire on 
about 100 people at a cemetery saturday wounding seven people 
officials said 
at least seven other people were trampled in the panic that 
followed the gunfire around 230 pm at rosedale memorial park in 
this city just south of newark and were treated at hospitals for 
cuts and bruises 
a 20yearold man who was among those shot was flown by 
helicopter to the trauma unit of university hospital in newark the 
others wounds were not considered lifethreatening hospital 
officials said 
police capt raymond beckman said the funeral was for a 
vietnamese man who was member of a new york gang called born to 
kill 
about 100 people were attending the funeral when the gunmen 
fired then fled beckman said 
as they walked by the casket with a bouquet of flowers they 
dropped them and opened fire on the mourners the captain said 
new york police said the funeral to bury vinh vuu 21 began in 
chinatown in lower manhattan earlier saturday vuu was shot four 
times in the chest early wednesday in a driveby shooting in 
chinatown said police sgt tina mohrmann 
she said vuu was a leader of the chinatownbased vietnamese gang 
beckman said three weapons were used including an uzi 
submachine gun and a shotgun a 9mm beretta handgun was found on 
the ground that gun which had been fired may have been used by 
someone in the crowd firing back at the shooters beckman said at 
a news conference 
police were searching for three suspects saturday night said 
police lt richard gerbounka 
beckman agreed with new york police that the shooting may be 
related to gangland strife between the vietnamese gang and chinese 
gangs in lower manhattan 
the gunmen were apparently wearing sunglasses and trench coats 
making it difficult for witnesses to say whether they were chinese 
vietnamese or caucasian beckman said 
the people attending the funeral were brought to the police 
station for questioning beckman said accounts differed on how the 
gunmen got away 
police earlier said investigation efforts were hindered because 
most of the mourners who were vietnamese spoke little or no 
english but beckman later said they spoke english and were 
cooperating 
the man flown to university hospital was taken to the operating 
room said nursing supervisor dorothy crews 
beckman said five people were shot but hospital officials said 
seven people were admitted for gunshot wounds 
one woman and five men aged 17 to 21 were taken to elizabeth 
general hospital where they were in stable condition with gunshot 
wounds said nursing supervisor bobbie fairchild a 22yearold man 
was treated for a twisted ankle

when they were trampled and for shock said hospital spokeswoman

bertha the first hurricane of the atlantic season 
was born saturday but turned away from the florida coast and 
headed out to sea forecasters said 
bertha became a tropical storm saturday afternoon but 
strengthened and was declared a hurricane hours later when its top 
sustained winds hit 75 mph 
hurricane bertha really isnt much of a concern to the us 
mainland said meteorologist jesse moore of the national 
hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
the only piece of land it could possibly affect at all would 
be bermuda and we dont have it forecast to go up that way yet 
he added its highly unlikely theyll see much more than some 
swells 
at 1030 pm edt berthas center was at 305 degrees north 
latitude and 728 degrees west longitude or 520 miles east of 
jacksonville the hurricane was moving northeast at about 10 mph 
and was expected to maintain that course through sunday 
forecasters said 
bertha is threatened by a lowpressure zone off the carolina and 
virginia coasts generating strong upperlevel winds that could cut 
the top off the hurricane and weaken it considerably moore said 
meanwhile tropical storm arthur which peaked with 70 mph wind 
thursday but quickly lost strength friday had completely 
dissipated you cant even see any remnants of him in the satellite 
pictures case said 
tropical storms are named when their sustained wind speed 
reaches 39 mph and become hurricanes when wind speed builds to 74 
mph the atlantic hurricane season runs from june 1 to nov 30

a federal appeals court said friday a new 
jersey woman should have been allowed to withdraw her guilty plea 
in an arms export case because her lawyer had not effectively 
represented her 
the threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for 
the district of columbia sent the case back to us district judge 
thomas penfiled jackson for further proceedings 
jackson had sentenced the woman rosemary loughery of mount 
holly nj to two years in prison in 1987 but had allowed her to 
remain free pending appeal 
she had pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to ship an air 
navigation beacon system with her business partner in violation of 
arms export license requirements her partner kevin paul gilday of 
philadelphia had been sentenced by the judge to 20 months to five 
years on the same conspiracy count 
ms loughery originally had been charged with the conspiracy 
count and nine counts of mail fraud alleging that the defendants 
tried to defraud the united states of the right to conduct its 
lawful business affairs and implement the foreign policy of the 
united states of america free from stealth chicanery false 
statements fraud and deceit 
on the advice of her lawyer francis hartman she agreed to 
plead guilty to the conspiracy count in exchange for dropping the 
mail fraud counts thus reducing her maximum exposure to prison 
from 50 years to five the appelate judges noted 
the judges also noted that though she told probation officers 
she believed she had done nothing wrong 
between her indictment and her plea the supreme court ruled 
that mail fraud charges could not be used to protect intangible 
rights but only in cases alleging the loss of money or property 
hartman did not tell his client of that development she found 
out about it through newspapers and told him she wanted to withdraw 
her plea of guilty but hartman advised her to wait until gilday 
was sentenced before making up her mind which she did 
jackson refused to let her withdraw the plea saying it was 
motivated by an apprehension that she will receive a like 
sentence she then fired hartman and got a new lawyer 
if she had withdrawn her plea when she wanted to three months 
earlier jackson probably would have let her the appellate panel 
said 
her constitutional right to a jury trial was at stake not 
hartmans the judges wrote friday 
this is not a case where counsel has made a strategic decision 
that in retrospect with the benefit of hindsight appears to have 
been illadvised rather hartmans conduct evinces an abdication 
of his repsonsibility to his client 
no beacons were delivered gilday had been dealing with 
undercover customs agents

a remotecontrolled submarine searching the 
ocean floor for the cargo door that blew off a united airlines jet 
last year has yet to find anything after four days underwater a 
navy spokesman said friday 
the orion deep submergence system equipped with sonar and a 
video camera is prowling the ocean bottom nearly three miles deep 
and about 100 miles south of honolulu 
the search will cover 24 square miles of the ocean floor twice 
and is expected to continue until the middle of next week lt 
cmdr bob anderson said 
in the feb 24 1989 accident the cargo door on united airlines 
flight 811 opened at 22000 feet tearing away a section of the 
boeing 747 fuselage of the 355 passengers aboard the flight from 
honolulu international airport to new zealand nine were swept to 
their deaths and five were seriously injured 
the crew managed to return the jet safely to honolulu 
the national transportation safety board has completed its 
inquiry into the accident but requested the search for the 10 
footby10 foot door with hopes its inspection will lead to better 
plane safety 
personnel aboard the 226foot navy ocean tug narragansett have 
placed in the ocean a field of electronic transponders which 
transmit electrical signals to chart movements of the video 
cameraequipped orion sub 
the transponders hang about 150 feet above the ocean floor 
around the perimeter of the search area 
if the door is spotted by the submersible a second device will 
be deployed at a later date to recover it 
the door is believed to be lying under about 15000 feet of 
water 
the ntsbs inquiry determined that a faulty design of the doors 
locking mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely 
indicate the door was locked 
it blamed united boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failure to correct problems with the door

the naacp and several black homeowners filed a 
discrimination lawsuit friday alleging that the citys largest 
provider of homeowners insurance instructed agents to stop writing 
policies for blacks 
the classaction lawsuit drafted by the american civil liberties 
union was filed in us district court against american family 
mutual insurance co based in madison 
we see this as a national issue as part of a national trend 
and in this country we still believe that separate but unequal is 
against the law said john powell national legal director for 
the aclu 
the action seeks unspecified monetary damages and a court order 
to stop the practice 
american family spokesman gary gibson declined to comment on the 
lawsuit saying he hadnt seen the document but he denied any 
charges of the practice known as redlining in which insurers 
instruct agents to avoid selling policies in areas with more than 
25 percent black residents 
we have made a concerted effort to serve the inner city and 
minorities gibson said in a brief telephone interview 
the plaintiffs include alderman marvin pratt who alleges the 
insurer reduced his homeowners coverage when he moved into an 
innercity neighborhood 
im just representative of the many numbers of folks who live 
in certain zip codes who have been discriminated against pratt 
said 
evidence in the lawsuit includes a handwritten note from an 
american family manager to an agent that reads quit writing all 
those blacks they are the reason for your poor persistency 
the note was turned over to the plaintiffs by an agent who has 
given a sworn statement about the companys practices said the 
aclu and the national association for the advancement of colored 
people 
the lawsuit alleged the insurer discriminates against black 
homeowners by instructing agents not to sell policies to blacks 
failing to hire and retain black agents and locate offices in black 
neighborhoods and offering blacks less advantageous terms than 
whites 
the lawsuit also alleged redlining wisconsin naacp president 
felmers chaney said redlining makes it difficult for black 
homeowners to maintain the value of their property leads to the 
decline of innercity neighborhoods and promotes segregation 
aclu spokesman william lynch said the problem of redlining is 
industrywide but american family has been sued because it has the 
worst record of discriminating against blacks

the state friday gave the roman catholic 
archdiocese of new york approval to care for aids patients in 
nursing homes exempting it from requirements that patients receive 
contraceptives safesex counseling and abortion services 
the state public health councils action came despite protests 
by some aids activists 
approval had been delayed while the archdiocese found ways to 
provide aids education without violating its teachings against 
condom use extramarital sex homosexuality and other practices 
the state requires that patients be told how to avoid the 
transmission of the aids virus by using condoms and to inform 
patients of the dangers of intravenous drug use 
under the compromise announced friday the archdiocese will 
provide education and information to nursing home residents about 
sexual practices that transmit aids and the benefits of condoms 
said health department spokeswoman frances tarleton 
catholic nursing homes will routinely refer patients to 
offpremise agencies for more intensive counseling or if they 
wanted to get condoms abortion or other gynecological services 
like birth control said tarleton 
the compromise will result in 266 new aids beds at three 
archdioceserun nursing homes there is no target date for adding 
the beds said archdiocesan spokesman joseph zwilling 
tarleton said that by the end of 1995 the city will need an 
estimated 3000 nursing home beds to care for aids patients there 
are now only 44 all at the terence cardinal cooke nursing home run 
by the archdiocese 
the state has received applications for only 1700 more beds 
despite incentives like statebacked loans enhanced medicaid 
reimbursements rates and planning grants 
members of actup an aids activist group demonstrated at 
fridays meeting they oppose the churchs involvement in aids care 
because of its stance on condoms abortion and other issues 
the fact of the matter is they archdiocese officials have 
come forward where other organizations have not said 
tarleton the states position is that we need desperately to get 
these nursing home beds in place in new york city 
she said the nursing homes will provide an alternative for aids 
patients languishing in hospital beds and for people who cant get 
home health care 
its not the most ideal way to handle aids prevention 
education but we think it does reflect an effort on the part of the 
archdiocese to provide these services to residents said 
tarleton

downsizing has become perhaps the most commonly 
used technique by which american businesses hope to contain costs 
and become more competitive managers say it is quick and effective 
those who have practiced it point to smaller payrolls reduced 
expenses and lower overall administrative costs sometimes plants 
and offices can be closed and sold off in general downsizing is 
viewed as cutting the fat 
that may be how its viewed but thats not the result says a 
professor who in three years talked to many chief executives and 
managers and surveyed 3000 management employees in 30 downsized 
companies 
the majority of downsizing efforts are failures declares 
profsssor kim s cameron of the university of michigan he found 
that unless management was very good the employees performed 
worse after the cutbacks 
in fact said cameron in only five or six of the 
organizations i studied did i see a marked increase in 
productivity in all the rest performance went down 
considering the context into which that statement was delivered 
it is indeed a shocking one in the past decade hardly a company 
with any measure of pride hasnt considered downsizing thousands 
did it 
at times downsizing became almost a fad 
it was the allpurpose remedy for ailments only vaguely 
discerned why it was even patriotic how could america compete in 
the new global economy if it wasnt lean mean fit and determined 
free of bureaucratic midriff 
but management says cameron has been reactive viewing 
downsizing as defensive protective conservative it hasnt been 
proactive rather than thinking through the issues it focused on 
the quick fix 
there is no such thing as a quick fix when downsizing says 
cameron such an approach is more destructive than constructive it 
is the grenade approach or throwing something at the problem 
and making a big noise 
effective downsizing must be thought through it must be part of 
a broad strategy because effective downsizing is a transformation 
of a firms culture as much as it is a reduction in personnel 
effectively implemented downsizing begins with an analysis of 
tasks resources and talents and an understanding of what jobs and 
people can be eliminated and which ones the company cannot afford 
to lose 
it must involve strong visible visionary leaders who can 
describe a process and outcome that employees will support it 
should involve bottomup participation of employees 
the strategy should employ teamwork especially among salaried 
workers and those teams should communicate with each other it 
should even involve suppliers distributors and customers 
rather than one huge and potentially destructive shock it is 
wiser to use small slow steps over a period of time all the 
while the downsizers should keep their eye on quality and the 
maintenance of it 
if you want to fail cameron observes you might try 
acrosstheboard layoffs and attrition without benefit of analysis 
load work on remaining employees seek more work for the same pay 
and think of quality only in terms of errordetection 
do that he suggests and the downsizing effort almost always 
begun in an attempt to make the company more efficient will make 
it worse off than before

the increasing likelihood of leaner times for 
the rest of the year will pile more problems on retailers 
struggling to stand out in a crowded pack and maintain market 
share analysts say 
laggard performers like sears roebuck and co will have tough 
jobs boosting profitability if consumer spending continues to slow 
by contrast powerhouses that have managed to motor along 
strongly despite a difficult economic environment are poised to go 
forward without a blip in their balance sheets in other words the 
walmarts of this world will prevail 
in an application of darwins theory of evolution the 
efficiently run retailers will survive and prosper while the weak 
ones could be headed for extinction says edward a weller of 
montgomery securities in san francisco 
no one wants to put sears on the endangered species list it is 
clear however that the nations largest retailer has more than a 
few things in common with the proverbial dinosaur 
this past week sears posted a 39 percent drop in secondquarter 
earnings although high insurance payouts by its allstate insurance 
group took a heavy toll on the company analysts were more 
concerned by the retailing results 
the drag on earnings caused by allstate was considered a 
onetime event the problems within the sears merchandise group 
which reported a 32 percent decline in operating income indicates 
something might be rotten at the core of the company 
long gone are the days when the retail giant was an industry 
standard bearer an effort begun last year to regain its glory by 
revamping merchandise strategy still hasnt borne fruit 
sears doublepronged program involving the introduction of more 
national brands from general electric appliances to pirelli tires 
and a switch to an everyday low pricing policy appears to be 
sparking little buying enthusiasm among customers 
analysts say the moves may have been made too late or maybe it 
just takes an extra long time to change the course of such a 
mammoth operation indeed it will take a lot to influence the 
bottom line of a company that annually reels in more than 30 
billion in revenue 
sears k mart are working like hell to get efficient but there 
isnt much evidence that theyre accomplishing it yet said 
weller i think its going to be tough for them 
sears and to a lesser extent its nearest rival k mart corp 
are playing catchup even though they outrank all their 
competitors in terms of nationwide sales volume 
this leaves room for nimbler competitors such as walmart 
stores inc to maneuver in building up marketplace clout 
walmart which is pursuing an aggressive expansion campaign is 
widely expected to eventually unseat sears and k mart from their 
top two positions on the national retail roster 
how soon or whether the nos 1 and 2 retailers get knocked 
from the top of the heap may depend on how they fare in the near 
future 
an unprecedented run of robust consumer spending in the 80s has 
waned replaced by an era of frugality economists say and consumer 
surveys confirm people are putting away more money in anticipation 
of lean times which reduces disposable income 
mindful of the forecasts store operators have kept close tabs 
on inventories to minimize costs and protect profitability 
orders have been flowing into stores for the important 
backtoschool season and analysts expect to get a reading on how 
well merchandise is moving out the door by late august or early 
september 
sluggish backtoschool business could be a harbinger of a 
hohum christmas season a time on which retailers rely for the 
bulk of their annual revenue and income 
its sort of a gloomy outlook for spending says karen sack 
of standard amp poors corp in new york it looks pretty rough for 
retailers

a torrential rain came right through the roof 
of the metropolitan cathedral during a news conference last year on 
preserving it and mexicos other historical treasures 
we had to leave the table because we were getting wet said 
efrain castro morales cultural secretary of puebla state it was 
a big scandal 
a subsequent study found the leaky roof to be a minor problem 
compared with others that might cause north americas oldest and 
most important cathedral to collapse in 30 years unless major 
repairs were made 
sergio zaldivar guerra an architect who conducted the study for 
the secretary of urban and ecological development said 
metropolitan cathedral has been sinking since construction began in 
1573 
the cathedral houses an impressive collection of religious 
paintings sculptures and altarpieces it has four identical domes 
five altars and 14 chapels with baroque and neoclassical touches 
but structurally everything is askew 
outside the buckling earth has broken the concrete of the 
plaza forming waves around the cathedral windows and doorframes 
tilt to left or right repaired cracks scar the walls metal 
patches and clamps mark and measure newer fissures that zigzag 
around the building 
inside thick crevices one about 66 feet long run along the 
marble floors and up the columns scaffolding blocks off areas 
where workers are repairing damaged domes the ceiling is dotted 
with water stains 
most of mexico city also is sinking because it is built on the 
swampy beds of lake texcoco over the ruins of tenochtitlan the 
aztec capital 
the spongy subsoils instability has damaged several important 
buildings including the adjacent national palace the palace of 
the fine arts and the basilica of the virgin of guadalupe 
zaldivar said the problems in the other structures were not as 
severe because the buildings were smaller and lighter than the 
cathedral which weighs an estimated 130000 tons 
he said the worst part is that the cathedral is sinking 
unevenly like a dried souffle 
the metropolitan cathedral took 250 years to complete and sits 
on the largest plaza in the western hemisphere second in the world 
only to red square in moscow 
during his 14month investigation zaldivar found fractures in 
domes and column bases and other damage to arches and walls 
acid rain has eroded the outer surface the area between the 
main altar and western tower has sunk about 8 feet and continues to 
drop at a rate of 05 inches a month 
construction of a drainage system in the 1960s also weakened the 
ground under the cathedral as did excavation of the aztec templo 
mayor or great temple subway construction and digging wells for 
drinking water 
they did not know what would happen zaldivar said of those 
decisions 
castro the state official said economic problems forced 
previous administrations to neglect mexicos important monuments 
but it did not have to reach this grave situation 
work was done but zaldivar said the scope of the problem was 
not known at the time 
he said the sinking cannot be stopped but the cathedral can be 
made to subside more evenly by digging pits under the higher parts 
and removing mud and sediment to lower them underground steel 
supports will be used to prop up sagging areas zaldivar said 
whatever is necessary will be spent and the government has 
made an initial allocation of 39 million for the restoration 
zaldivar said the work which began three months ago will take at 
least 6 years and the cathedral will remain open 
zaldivar said the work would have to be repeated periodically 
over at least the next century until earth stops compressing and 
solidifies 
it is safe for the next 30 years but the sooner we complete 
the work the better he said

its already flown through more than a decade of 
staggering losses relentless competition a difficult takeover 
managementlabor feuding an emotional strike bankruptcy court and 
blasts of bad press 
so the last thing eastern airlines needed was a criminal 
indictment for doctoring maintenance records an unprecedented 
event in the airline business 
nonetheless industry analysts and travel agents dont view the 
60count indictment handed up this past week against eastern and 
nine managers as a fatal bullet for an airline that has 
demonstrated its ability to survive 
some say eastern could handily ride this one out partly by 
cutting its alreadydiscounted fares further in order to woo 
skeptical passengers 
if eastern is going to charge less with no restrictions on 
the tickets people are still going to fly them no matter what 
said jack bloch owner of jbs travel world a new york travel 
agency everyone whos on a budget thing will fly them 
william cooper head of adventure travels of pompano beach and 
boca raton fla said he believed many passengers already have a 
thick skin about flying in general and quickly will forget the 
eastern indictment 
i know passengers who will say if the pilots willing to get 
into the airplane and risk his life why shouldnt i cooper 
said i think eastern has had enough of a public relations 
problem anyway so how much more damage can this do 
the indictment was the result of a 10month probe by federal 
prosecutors into the airlines maintenance practices at airports in 
new york and atlanta and easterns headquarters in miami 
it portrayed a pattern of violations that included installing 
faulty cockpit instruments and ignoring water buildups in fuel 
tanks as well as tinkering with maintenance records to show all 
work had been done properly 
the indictment also depicted eastern as coercing maintenance 
crews to flout safety guidelines at all costs for sake of keeping 
airplanes flying and passengerticket revenue flowing 
none of the alleged infractions caused accidents or injuries and 
all were said to have taken place between july 1985 and last 
october a federal grand jury in brooklyn delivered the indictment 
after plea bargain talks between the airline and us attorney 
andrew maloney collapsed 
the indictment posed an acute challenge to martin r shugrue 
jr an airline veteran appointed to run eastern three months ago 
by a federal bankruptcy court the court has been overseeing 
easterns affairs since march 1989 when a crippling strike forced 
the airline to seek protection from creditors 
in appointing shugrue the court took control of eastern from 
frank lorenzo the head of easterns parent continental holdings 
lorenzo bought eastern in 1986 and subsequently was accused by 
easterns unions of nearly bleeding the carrier to death to cut 
costs and make eastern profitable 
shugrue had been in the midst of orchestrating an aggressive 
campaign to put the lorenzo legacy behind and convince the flying 
public that eastern and its workers are exuberant efficient and 
safe 
he sought to minimize the indictments impact by announcing it 
before maloney did he also took out advertisements in leading 
newspapers nationwide asserting that the federal aviation 
administration had fined eastern 16 months ago for the same 
problems and everything had been corrected 
today if eastern werent meeting the highest government 
standards of safety we would not be flying shugrue said 
industry experts familiar with easterns past problems agreed 
with him 
i think eastern reacted intelligently with the ads they drove 
home the fact that this is stale bread said morten beyer 
chairman of avmark an aviation consulting concern in arlington va 
no airplanes were delayed no airplanes crashed nobody was 
hurt it was a victimless crime he said so i dont think its 
going to have a protracted effect 
still the indictment could compound an already difficult 
financial situation for eastern it came only a few months before 
the airline industrys slowest part of the year begins that means 
an already strapped eastern is facing the prospect of cutting fares 
to woo business 
a lot of people realize that for eastern to survive the 
present structure cant continue cooper said theyve got some 
fares that are so low now in certain markets theyre losing their 
shirts how much lower can they go how much are other airlines 
going to allow them to go 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more evidence emerged that showed the economy has fallen to 
nearrecession levels the government said gross national product 
grew at an anemic 12 percent rate in the apriljune quarter and it 
revised estimates of earlier growth downward major automakers 
reported slumping car sales while leading companies such as sears 
digital equipment and mcdonalds reported slumping earnings the 
stock market fretted and took a sharp plunge early in the week 
two of the most economically desperate countries followed 
unusual strategies to market their raw materials the soviet union 
starved for hard currency appeared to reduce its support for black 
african nationalism by agreeing to sell uncut diamonds through a 
powerful cartel run by de beers south africas bestknown company 
in the middle east iraq threatened two opec neighbors with 
military force unless they quit pumping excessive amounts of crude 
which the iraqis claimed was depressing the price shortly 
thereafter the oil cartel reached an agreement to cut production 
and raise the price 
michael milken and ivan boesky the bestknown white collar 
felons of high finance were granted congressional immunity from 
additional prosecution in exchange for their testimony about wall 
street corruption and shady junkbond dealings

with all the problems posed by a squeeze on 
credit some wall street analysts still believe the us economy 
can withstand the pressure without much widespread longterm 
damage 
indeed they contend the pain occurring now for the banking 
business and its customers holds out the promise of future gains in 
stability and the potential for growth 
as lenders cut back many worry that a credit shortfall might 
stop the economy in its tracks says maureen allyn chief 
economist at the new york investment management firm of scudder 
stevens amp clark inc 
we think the pluses will continue to outweigh the minuses and 
the economy will avoid recession 
to many an armchair economist the sight of a clampdown on 
lending immediately evokes visions of a looming slump for workers 
consumers and businesses 
in the 1980s the reasoning goes business and financial 
activity was pumped up by a rapid expansion in the use of borrowed 
money now that a restricted diet of credit has been prescribed 
belttightening would seem to be the order of the day 
that certainly has been the case for the depressed homebuilding 
and real estate markets in many areas of the country 
but on an overall basis ms allyn maintains a slowdown in 
credit does not by itself guarantee an exactly parallel pattern in 
economic growth 
some parts of the economy use more credit than others she 
points out real estate for example is voracious 
during the last half of the 1980s mortgages devoured over 40 
percent of all new loans yet home and office building produced 
only about 6 percent of the gross national product 
on the other side of the ledger exporting 14 percent of gnp 
uses only a smidgen of borrowing now and then to finance 
inventories or procure a letter of credit 
the rising parts of the economy depend less on credit than the 
slowing parts 
government statistics made public on friday showed growth in 
output struggling along at a 12 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation in the second quarter of the year 
that gave investors scant encouragement about the prospects for 
improvement in corporate earnings which lately have provoked more 
than a few problems in the stock market 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 
289851 down 6263 from the week before on monday the indicator 
plunged sharply falling more than 100 points at one time before 
recovering partly due to skepticism about economic and corporate 
earnings prospects 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 433 to 
19332 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 1268 to 44259 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 496 at 35549 
volume on the big board averaged 17172 million shares a day 
against 16696 million the week before 
increasingly it appears that the ongoing story for the 1990s 
will be that of shrinkage of financial empires built on excessive 
debt said vincent agnew of the investment management group at 
chicago title and trust co 
so far the negative impact of this trend has been more 
pronounced in some areas of the country than others but the 
economy is now beginning to make some modest progress despite the 
frugality that appears to be transforming the banking system 
our guess is the worst may be over and the shortterm 
dislocations may in fact enhance chances for a more upbeat economic 
story in 1991
