more than 130 heart patients are alive today 
because of the sacrifices william schroeder made the surgeon who 
implanted his artificial heart said sunday at a memorial dedication 
dr william devries implanted the jarvik7 heart in schroeder on 
nov 25 1984 and the second man ever to receive the device went on 
to become the person to survive the longest with it 620 days 
before he died aug 6 1986 at humana hospital audubon in 
louisville ky 
a 13foot stainless steel sculpture gateway to the heart 
was dedicated sunday at the bill schroeder sports complex 
schroeders widow margaret attended the ceremony 
i owe a lot to bill schroeder and i think the world owes a lot 
to bill schroeder devries said today in the united states 
alone there are over 130 patients that are alive today because of 
what he did 
these people would not have had the chance to live with the 
artificial heart these are all patients that have had to bridge a 
transplant who are currently alive because of what he gave the 
legacy he gave devries said 
all patients who received experimental permanent implants of 
artificial hearts since barney clark received the first one in 1982 
have died as a result the federal food and drug administration 
allows the device to be used now only as a bridge until a compatible 
human heart can be transplanted 
mrs schroeder said the location of the privately financed 
memorial by sculptor bernard hagedorn was special to her because 
sports were her husbands second love after his family 
as i gaze at the gateway to the heart i can envision so many 
different meanings of what it symbolizes she said but with its 
meanings the underlying theme to me has to be home when bill was 
in the air force we made home in many different parts of the 
country but deep in his heart home was always jasper indiana

surgeon general c everett koop said sunday that 
efforts are failing to educate blacks and hispanics about the deadly 
aids virus and that illiteracy might by the problem 
it is a real problem in this country koop said at a news 
conference before an address to the annual meeting of the 
association of american medical colleges 
we have made the effort to try to employ black and hispanic 
public relations firms in order to get our message to that 
particular group so its very difficult to understand where 
these black and hispanic groups are making their errors koop said 
of the 77994 aids cases reported since june 1981 in the united 
states 26 percent were among blacks and 15 percent among hispanics 
according to statistics through nov 7 from the national centers for 
disease control in atlanta 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
koop said such barriers as illiteracy in the black and hispanic 
communities might be part of the problem in conveying information 
about how to prevent the disease 
another factor is poor access to health care among blacks and 
hispanics as well as other groups at high risk for contracting 
aids including prostitutes and drug users 
we have to make sure that they get health care koop said 
but often they dont know where to get it and many times the 
medical profession doesnt feel comfortable treating them 
aids is a mystery he said it scares people it is 
fatal and that scares people and therefore its very hard to 
reach out and talk frankly about the disease 
also at the news conference dr anthony s fauci associate 
director for aids research at the national institutes of health 
said efforts are being made to include more blacks and hispanics in 
clinical trials of antiaids drugs 
hundreds of demonstrators who temporarily closed the federal food 
and drug administration headquarters in rockville md on oct 11 
had complained that white men were being given primary access to 
experimental treatments

a strong earthquake occurred in the vicinity of 
papua new guinea in the western pacific the pacific tsunami warning 
center said sunday 
the quake measuring 67 on the richter scale hit at 416 pm 
916 pm est near 17 south latitude and 1502 east longitude 
the center said 
the quake was not powerful enough to generate a pacificwide 
tsunami or tidal wave the center said 
the national earthquake information center said the earthquake 
occurred about 125 miles northwest of rabaul new britain and that 
there were no immediate reports of damage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 6 on the richter scale can cause severe damage 
a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy 
damage the san francisco earthquake of 1906 which occurred before 
the richter scale was devised has been estimated at 83 on the 
richter scale

plo leaders accepted a un resolution 
sunday implicitly recognizing israels right to exist and 
recommended the plos parliament endorse the decision 
approval by the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile is virtually certain and would meet one of the 
conditions for us recognition of the palestine liberation 
organization 
the action by a committee of plo leaders showed that chairman 
yasser arafat has won his struggle with hardliners over the 
controversial un resolution 242 in the 450member pnc 80 percent 
to 85 percent of the parliamentarians are aligned with arafat 
in washington president reagan was asked if he was pleased with 
the plo leaders action and said were still looking at that 
thats all i can say 
in another development abul abbas the palestinian who 
masterminded the hijacking of the italian cruise ship achille lauro 
in 1985 spoke to reporters about the incident and dismissed the 
killing of american leon klinghoffer as similar to a motoring 
accident the new york times reported monday 
maybe he was trying to swim for it the times quoted abbas as 
telling reporters outside the hall where the pnc is meeting he 
compared the hijacking to driving a car and said you have an 
accident on the way accidents happen 
klinghoffer of new york city a 69yearold wheelchairbound 
passenger was shot and pushed overboard during the hijacking 
the declaration accepting the un resolution will be presented 
to the plenary session of the pnc which began a special fourday 
meeting in algiers on saturday 
the pnc will come out with a political decision and a program 
of peace plo spokesman ahmed abdulrahman said 
in the political statement we will adopt all resolutions of 
the un security council dealing with the palestinian question 
whats more we will emphasize resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis 
for an international conference to achieve peace in the middle 
east 
resolution 242 calls for an end to hostilities and israeli 
withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war adopted by the 
security council in 1967 it implicitly recognizes israel by 
referring to the right of all states in the area to live within 
secure and recognized borders 
resolution 338 passed in 1973 during the arabisraeli war calls 
for an end to fighting urges implementation of resolution 242 and 
most important calls for negotiations between arabs and israel 
toward a just and durable peace in the middle east 
in closeddoor committee meetings there was strong opposition to 
resolution 242 from the marxistoriented groups particularly george 
habashs popular front for the liberation of palestine 
habashs faction is the secondlargest of the eight groups 
comprising the plo arafats fatah is the largest 
sources close to the talks said that after two days of haggling 
it was clear no compromise was possible 
habash agreed to note his reservations but bow to the majority 
and not create a major split 
salah khalaf a top arafat aide known as abu iyad said never 
in my career have i seen the palestinian leadership acting as 
responsibly as it is during this session unity is priority and the 
minority is accepting the verdict of the majority without any hard 
feelings 
abdulrahman said the council wanted to adopt resolutions 
unanimously although it also was capable of operating by majority 
rule 
the palestinian council meeting is expected to conclude tuesday 
with a declaration of independence for the west bank and gaza strip 
those opposed to resolution 242 objected to its referring to the 
future of palestinians in the occupied territories as a just 
settlement of the refugee problem 
the algiers conference was called to deal with the new 
developments in the middle east and especially to take advantage of 
increased attention and sympathy for the palestinian cause sparked 
by the uprising in the israelioccupied territories 
more than 310 palestinians and 11 israelis have been killed in 
the 11month uprising 
besides a declaration of palestinian independence and approval of 
a political program that includes acceptance of resolution 242 the 
conference was expected to establish a provisional government 
abdulrahman said there was a draft resolution on a provisional 
government 
this draft calls for formation of the government by the central 
council and the executive committee of the plo and the timing is 
linked directly to the conclusion of preparations for an 
international conference said abdulrahman 
plo officials including abdulrahman have stressed that the 
provisional goverment when it is formed would not be an 
alternative to the plo but an institution of the plo mandated to 
negotiate peace

freed hostage mithileshwar singh said 
his months in the captivity of islamic fundamentalist kidnappers 
left no emotional scars but he feels guilt that his friends are 
still being held and believes much of the fault lies with the 
reagan administration 
in an interview published in the sunday editions of the 
journalnews of nyack ny singh said he wonders what is holding 
up the liberation of nine remaining american hostages in lebanon 
i see french hostages theyre all out i look to german 
hostages theyre all out im happy for all of them but we have 
not done something to get the americans released singh said in 
the interview friday 
if somehow we could unfreeze our positions it would help he 
added negotiations do not mean concessions 
nine americans are among the 14 foreigners being held hostage in 
lebanon 
singh 61 was released oct 3 by moslem extremists who had been 
holding him hostage for 20 months three of his american colleagues 
from beirut university college jesse turner alann steen and robert 
polhill remain in captivity 
after you stay so long for so many hours with so many 
friends you are out and they are still behind you feel a sense of 
guilt singh said 
however the captivity left no mental no physical scar of any 
kind the indian citizen who is a legal resident of the united 
states said at the stony point center he has stayed at the retreat 
and conference center run by the united presbyterian church since 
returning to the united states 
singh had been in the lebanese capital since 1982 working as 
chairman of the business department at beirut university college he 
and his colleagues were kidnapped on the night of jan 24 1987 
when armed men showed up at a meeting they attended 
the treatment could be characterized as relatively better than 
we had anticipated he said the captors provided playing cards 
and chess sets for their amusement decent food and adequate medical 
care 
the four of us kept together that was an integral part of the 
whole thing singh recalled we were able to discuss able to 
analyze we were able to share each others frustrations 
disappointments and hopes and aspirations

five guerrillas held a unifil command post in 
the israeli security zone in south lebanon sunday but have 
apparently reached an agreement with un troops surrounding the 
post israeli and un officials said 
the guerrillas armed with submachine guns and hand grenades 
seized the command post saturday night in the village of taibeh 
about a mile north of the israelilebanon border it was not clear 
to what organization the guerrillas belonged 
they overpowered a single unifil sentry who stood guard while 
four other soldiers slept unifil spokesman timor goksel said the 
sentry alerted un troops stationed nearby 
he did not report any casualties in the attack on the post 
manned by finnish troopers of the 5800member united nations 
interim force in lebanon 
the guerrillas have demanded a unifil escort out of the command 
post goksel said in an interview saturday night 
theres a bit of a problem they the guerrillas are 
somewhat disoriented perhaps intoxicated goksel told the 
associated press we are trying to sort of talk them out of the 
place they are more relaxed now and their hostility has dropped 
it didnt sound like a hostage game but we of course cannot 
allow an escort we do not know what their intentions are he said 
on sunday a unifil official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said there is no change in the situation 
but an israeli military official who also insisted on anonymity 
said unifil has reached an agreement with the guerrillas he said 
the guerrillas would leave the area accompanied by a unifil escort 
and on condition that the israeli army would not intervene 
goksel said unifil did not ask for help from the israeli army or 
the south lebanon army an israeliallied militia in southern 
lebanon that would make things more difficult he added 
israel carved out the security zone a strip of land north of the 
lebanese border when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from 
lebanon in 1985 after the 1982 invasion the 610 milewide brder 
strip is patrolled by israeli military units and militiamen of the 
south lebanon army

one early test on the possibility for 
cooperation between presidentelect george bush and the 
democratcontrolled congress will be on nicaragua perhaps the most 
contentious foreign policy issue of recent years 
at a news conference last wednesday bush said the nicaraguan 
contras will have high priority in his administration and he 
pledged to keep the pressure on the sandinistas to institute 
democratic reform 
but he stopped short of saying that a proposal for military aid 
will be sent to congress 
the reagan administration and congress were never able to achieve 
a consensus on nicaragua because of philosophical differences that 
were compounded by deep personal mistrust among the leaders in both 
branches 
in an interview last week outgoing assistant secretary of state 
elliott abrams the administration protagonist on contra aid for 
more than three years said the emergence of a whole new cast of 
characters in january could give the contra aid cause a shot in 
the arm 
in effect he said the democrats opposed to contra aid have been 
saying we dont trust president reagan and his associates we 
dont think you are really serious about negotiating 
abrams said that with a new group taking over on january 20 it 
would be very odd for congress to start the relationship by saying 
glad to meet you we dont trust you 
he said a significant reduction in personal bitterness 
combined with the increased repression in nicaragua will tilt 
the congressional balance in favor of the contras 
much of the bitterness abrams alluded to was directed at him 
personally mostly because leading congressional democrats felt his 
word could not be trusted 
but congressional sources doubt that the new administration will 
choose to do battle early on with capitol hill on an issue as 
divisive as contra aid 
this is said to be the position of house speaker jim wright 
dtex who believes contra aid is a dead issue according to an 
associate 
the conventional wisdom is that they the incoming 
administration will pick fights that they can win and this a 
clearly not one of them said one congressional source insisting 
on anonymity the mood in congress has not changed 
one alternative to renewed contra military aid is additional 
international pressure on the sandinistas secretary of state george 
p shultz is expected to issue an appeal for such pressure when he 
addresses a meeting of hemispheric foreign ministers on monday in el 
salvador 
but abrams believes diplomatic pressure must be supplemented by 
military pressure calling the contras a critical element for a 
successful policy 
during the campaign bush sought to avoid references to 
nicaragua partly because raising that issue could have revived 
memories of the irancontra affair a subject on which he generally 
was on the defensive 
still bush did say three weeks ago that he absolutely would 
ask congress for contra military aid if there is no progress in the 
central america peace process 
on thursday wright indicated a willingness to pursue a fresh 
start with the bush administration on nicaragua 
i hope it will be possible in nicaragua that we might find some 
avenue which both of us can embrace a path on which we can walk 
hand in hand he said 
reagan lost his last bid for congressional approval of military 
aid in february since then once in march and again in september 
congress has agreed to sixmonth allocations of humanitarian aid in 
the form of food clothing shelter and medical services 
the aid is being distributed to camps on the honduran side of the 
nicaraguan border where about 10000 rebels have gathered since last 
spring an estimated 2000 remain inside nicaragua many experts 
doubt the contras can ever be reconstituted as an effective fighting 
force but abrams disagrees 
humanitarian aid does serve to keep them as an organized force 
until we can turn congress around he said

the us semiconductor industry is feeling the 
chill breeze of a slowdown for the first time since the disastrous 
collapse of 1985 and 1986 
only recently the industry seemed robust with record sales and 
profits but three events last week illustrated that setbacks occur 
quickly in the volatile business 
a key measure of the chip industrys health the booktobill 
ratio fell to 092 its lowest point since november 1985 a reading 
below 100 often signals a slump 
surprising analysts national semiconductor corp said it 
expects to report a significant operating loss for its fiscal 
quarter ending nov 27 
advanced micro devices inc said it will lay off as many as 
1000 us workers or 7 percent of its work force 
the good news is that few industry watchers expect the coming 
slowdown to be as severe as the one in 198586 when american chip 
makers lost 500 million and silicon valley lost more than 17000 
electronics jobs 
the middecade depression in the chip business stemmed from vast 
overproduction which led to accumulation of excess inventories that 
took nearly two years to work off 
chip makers distributors and users are monitoring inventories 
much more closely this time to prevent them from getting too high 
analysts say 
no way are we going to have that kind of inventory cycle that 
led to the last crash said elizabeth baatz an economist for 
cahners publishing co in newton mass 
ms baatz is forecasting a decline of about 3 percent next year 
in sales to the north american market by the worlds chip makers 
other sources are more optimistic us sales of semiconductors 
should rise 12 percent next year according to a poll of chip makers 
released in september by world semiconductor trade statistics 
but even a 12 percent increase would be far from the 30 percent 
growth the industry is experiencing this year 
the chip business does not tolerate slow growth as well as other 
industries because it needs good sales to recoup the enormous cost 
of building stateoftheart fabrication plants 
the last industry recession drove some companies out of business 
and even a mild softening this time would hurt the ability of us 
chip makers to research develop and invest for the future in 
contrast to the japanese giants most american chip makers lack 
other lines of business to carry them over the rough spots 
its very tough if youre not prepared to deal with it said 
larry borgman an analyst in new york for nomura securities 
international inc 
the biggest factor in the slowdown is a softening of sales of 
personal computers mainly the less expensive models analysts say 
companies such as advanced micro that sell heavily to personal 
computer makers are among the first to be hurt also amd lags in 
switching over to cmos technology which is for chips that consume 
less power 
but advanced micro insists it will not be the only company to 
suffer we just fell out of bed first said michael kubiak the 
head of investor relations for the sunnyvale califbased company 
texas instruments inc and micron technology inc still are 
enjoying the benefits of a shortage of production capacity for 
drams or dynamic random access memories they are the only 
usbased companies that sell those chips to the open market 
but japanese companies which control 90 percent of the world 
dram market are spending heavily on new capacity sometime next 
year the increased production will cause dram prices to fall 
probably steeply analysts say 
intel corp and motorola inc are in a better position to 
withstand a softer market according to millard phelps an analyst 
for hambrecht amp quist in san francisco 
intel in particular is the only producer of the 80386 
microprocessor that goes into fast expensive and hotselling 
personal computers from international business machines corp 
compaq computer corp and others intel has been unwilling to 
license the microprocessor to other manufacturers except ibm which 
so far has shown no interest in making the chip 
finally some specialty chip makers such as cypress semiconductor 
corp xicor lsi logic corp and vlsi technology inc have products 
that are in demand and should stay that way for awhile analysts say 
we are at the end of the semiconductor business cycle to be 
sure phelps said but were painting the entire industry with 
the same brush there are definite differences those differences 
are the place to focus today

latin american nations will meet in 
late november to discuss common strategies for dealing with the 
regions 400 billion foreign debt brazils finance minister said 
in an interview published sunday 
we latin americans dont want a confrontation with creditors 
but we dont accept the situation as it is today finance 
minister mailson da nobrega said in an interview published by rios 
respected jornal do brasil newspaper 
we are trying to pay but we cant continue sending 45 percent 
of the gross national product abroad each year in debt interest 
payments we cant sustain this in the long run he said 
da nobrega said economists from all latin nations would meet 
in brazil in late november to prepare for a meeting of latin 
american finance ministers scheduled for dec 1112 
in the united states the idea is also maturing that without 
taking another step in the debt crisis there wont be development in 
latin america da nobrega told the newspaper we latin nations 
want to act politically to accelerate the adoption of measures that 
are in the air everyone feels something will happen as early as 
next year 
da nobrega said the brazilian governments next step in relation 
to the countrys 121 billion in foreign loans was to reduce the 
amount of its outstanding debt 
in a limited number of cases this already has been done by 
swapping debt for equity in brazilian businesses 
this is an idea that is maturing and receiving a greater 
consensus da nobrega said we are closely following the 
evolution of this idea in academic areas in some governments and 
within certain banks 
in september brazil signed an accord with creditor banks to 
refinance some 80 billion of its debt over 20 years with an 
eightyear grace period in return brazil was to receive 52 
billion from creditors to help finance interest payments

the investor group waging a 27 billion hostile 
bid to acquire interco inc said sunday it was extending its offer 
by two days but threatened to withdraw it if the company continued 
refusing to negotiate 
cardinal acquisition corp extended its 74 a share cash tender 
offer which was to expire at midnight monday through midnight 
wednesday 
the group headed by the brothers steven and mitchell rales of 
washington dc in a letter to intercos board of directors also 
stated it would terminate the offer if the company had not agreed by 
5 pm wednesday to give the group confidential corporate 
information or enter into buyout talks 
cardinal acquisition announced last wednesday that interco 
stockholders had tendered 296 million shares under its offer 
combined with the 32 million shares the group already owns that 
would give the raleses control of 92 percent of intercos 
outstanding shares 
in its letter the group contended the only barrier to completion 
of a buyout was the companys refusal to withdraw its poison pill 
takeover defense 
last week the delaware chancery court enjoined the use of the 
defense but interco has appealed the decision to the delaware 
supreme court which agreed to hear the appeal on nov 30 interco 
which is based in st louis is incorporated in delaware 
a spokesman for the rales brothers said after the ruling that 
they would not purchase any interco shares until the issue was 
resolved in the state supreme court 
interco also said last wednesday it would seek a preliminary 
injunction against cardinals tender offer 
interco employs about 54000 people nationwide and controls such 
wellknown clothing furniture and shoe brands as london fog ethan 
allen converse and florsheim last year the company reported sales 
of 334 billion 
interco has rebuffed attempts by the rales brothers since they 
first offered to acquire the company for 64 a share in july 
subsequently interco fashioned a restructuring program and moved to 
adopt the poison pill which would make an unwanted takeover 
prohibitively expensive

president reagan said sunday he does not 
believe this weeks decline in the stock market has anything to do 
with george bush 
the head of presidentelect bushs transition team meanwhile 
sought to calm wall street with assurances that bush sees no reason 
to push down the value of the dollar to increase exports 
reagan returning to the white house from a weekend at camp 
david the presidential hideaway in the mountains of western 
maryland was asked why the market dropped after bushs election on 
tuesday 
ive given up trying to guess why the market does that he 
replied i dont think it has anything to do with george bush 
transition cochief craig fuller said financial markets could be 
misreading some of the tea leaves by falling in reaction to 
calls for a cheaper dollar by martin feldstein a former chairman of 
the council of economic advisers who has advised bush from time to 
time 
feldstein said on wednesday he believes the dollar should be 
about 20 percent cheaper in terms of major foreign currencies 
a cheaper dollar means it takes more of them to buy a german 
mark japanese yen or other currency other things being equal this 
makes us exports cheaper and thus more competitive but at the same 
time makes imported goods from cars to textiles more expensive 
adding to inflationary pressures 
though treasury officials said they saw no reason to seek a lower 
dollar the dollar declined on foreign exchange markets in what 
traders said was reaction to feldsteins remarks 
reacting in turn to those declines the dowjones industrial 
average finished the week at 206703 a drop of 7847 for the week 
of which 4766 came on friday 
we see no reason to change the policies that are in place right 
now with respect to the dollar fuller said in an appearance on 
the nbctv show meet the press 
i can tell you bush listens to a lot of people on 
economics fuller said he has not supported what marty feldstein 
said it is not the policy of this administration and it is not 
going to be the policy of the next administration 
on another interview program sen pete domenici dnm senior 
republican on the senate budget committee said i am not at all 
impressed by the frenzy of wall street and the moneychangers 
theyre running around acting as if some living human being could 
have solved this problem the deficit in 10 days 
i think it will get solved about july or august domenici 
said on the cbstv program face the nation 
fuller said what the markets need to know is that george bush 
is committed to what he talked about during the campaign and that is 
to get spending under control and reduce the size of this deficit 
to that end he said bushs first priority is the appointment of 
economic officials to prepare for discussions with congress on how 
to reduce the deficit the projected 132 billion deficit will have 
to be cut by 32 billion in the next budget as called for by the 
grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction law 
bush campaigned on a read my lips no new taxes slogan and 
fuller said thats what hell say in january 
he will sit down with the congress and try to find a way to 
bring this deficit down by not increasing peoples taxes fuller 
said 
but theres no question revenues must be a part of any budget 
solution sen bennett johnston dla a candidate for senate 
majority leader said on the abctv show this week with david 
brinkley 
thats not a question of philosophy thats a question of 
mathematics johnston said 
transition codirector robert teeter also on the brinkley show 
said there have been big increases in discretionary spending 
over the past 20 years they have not been pulled down even in 
the budget tightness of the reagan years 
as possible cuts domenici mentioned the 2 billion in annual 
subsidies for the exportimport bank 80 million for the 
appalachian regional commission 450 million in regional economic 
development programs and as much as 1 billion in subsidies to 
amtrak and mass transit 
appearing with domenici rep thomas foley dwash the house 
majority leader said those cuts could be important but not 
obviously sufficient to deal with whats in the deficit 
if george bush as president of the united states wants to 
say no new taxes there will be no new taxes foley said 
the democrats are not going to go pounding on the door begging 
the president to change his mind on that and raise taxes nor are we 
going to push legislation toward him so he can veto it
