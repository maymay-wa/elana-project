scientists today said they have identified what 
may be the first step in the process that causes the most common 
and severe form of muscular dystrophy 
they found that human muscle cells affected by the disease 
largely lack a protein normally found on the cell surface 
lack of that protein may permit the muscle destruction that 
marks the disease the scientists reported in the british journal 
nature 
the work dealt with duchenne muscular dystrophy it is a genetic 
disorder that strikes boys almost exclusively appearing in about 
one in every 3500 male births in the united states 
it causes a progressive weakening and wasting of voluntary 
muscles most patients must use wheelchairs by age 12 and most die 
in their early 20s 
the new work was done by kevin campbell and colleagues at the 
howard hughes medical institute and department of physiology and 
biophysics at the university of iowa college of medicine 
the researchers followed up a 1987 discovery that the basic 
defect in muscles affected by duchenne is the lack of a protein 
called dystrophin the protein is missing because of a flaw in the 
gene that normally tells muscle cells how to produce it 
at the time of the discovery nobody knew what dystrophin 
normally does in muscle cells nor why its absence would cause the 
disease 
one puzzle was that dystrophin had no apparent connection to the 
surface of muscle cells where scientists knew that early 
abnormalities occurred in duchenne 
the new work provides that connection shedding important light 
on the duchenne disease process said dr salvatore dimauro of 
columbia university in new york 
campbell and colleagues found that dystrophin is normally bound 
to a complex of four proteins on the surface of muscle cells 
dystrophin apparently acts to anchor the complex to cytoskeleton a 
region of fibrous material beneath the cell surface campbell said 
in a telephone interview 
researchers were able to test for the presence of one of the 
four surface proteins and they found that muscle samples from 
duchenne patients contained only about 10 percent of normal levels 
without its dystrophin anchor the protein is probably destroyed by 
the cell campbell said 
the researchers have not yet been able to check levels of the 
other proteins in the surface complex he said perhaps the whole 
complex is missing or disrupted in duchenne cells triggering the 
death of muscle fibers he said

if you beam up youre not headed for the 
starship enterprise youre getting high on crack but if youre 
popping junk youre not using heroin youre gossiping 
thats the word according to a dictionary of street slang 
compiled so the citys beleaguered public school educators can 
understand and thus control their highly colloquial and often 
unruly students 
peter commanday an instructor in the schools division of 
school safety says he began compiling slang words and terms 
when he was dean of discipline in a junior high school in the 
citys south bronx neighborhood 
i didnt understand what i was hearing he said monday when 
kids greeted him whats happenin he was so unhip hed 
actually try to tell them 
i had all these degrees and these kids were speaking to me and 
i did not understand what they were saying he said but i 
needed to know street slang because that is the language of 
violence and that was my business 
the dictionary contains 221 words and expressions from aint 
no thang no problem and audi to run through zimmer 
girl and zootie high or crazy 
the dictionary doesnt discuss the origin of the terms 
it was compiled by commanday and hundreds of graduates of 
peacemaking the management of confrontation a course he 
teaches for administrators teachers and school security officers 
interested in learning how to prevent and defuse school violence 
the glossary is topheavy with the language of drugs and 
conflict including shermed high on pcp cap to hit and 
base argue 
the glossary ranges from the old or obvious even ozzie nelson 
knew dig means understand to the most obscure popping 
junk means gossiping some terms are used in only one part of the 
city others across the country 
since one purpose of slang is to exclude outsiders such as 
parents and teachers presumably a terms inclusion in commandays 
dictionary renders it hopelessly passe among the experts slang 
that was obscure only a few years ago such as def terrific 
real good cool and home boy good friend pal already has 
lost some of its cachet 
slang in fact becomes part of the language so fast that 
commanday uses slang to define slang after reading that a 
bazooka is a joint laced with coca paste a teacher ok a 
really naive teacher would have to flip to joint but there 
are three definitions 1 marijuana 2 jail 3 a fight 
educators and other school personnel must understand the lingo 
because much of the violence and other trouble in school begins 
with talk the human tongue commanday insists is the most 
volatile dangerous weapon brought into a school building 
commanday 57 is a lean graying 6footer who says he broke up 
1000 fights and confiscated 400 weapons during 15 years service 
in the south bronx in his board of education classes and the 
workshops he leads around the country commanday uses slang and 
profanity to talk to and abuse educators just like the kids 
would but he says slang shouldnt be used to speak to students 
only to listen to them 
when school personnel do speak to students they often talk 
dirty without ever cursing according to commanday theyre 
likely to use what he calls the two dirtiest words in the 
language calm down it denies the validity of whatever has 
upset the other person youre dissing him showing 
disrespect

burma the isolated nation sometimes called the 
hermit of asia is about to hold its first multiparty election 
in decades here is a report from aye aye win associated press 
correspondent in rangoon to which ap correspondents in neighboring 
thailand contributed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
burma will hold its first multiparty 
elections in 30 years sunday but two of the military regimes main 
opponents are under house arrest and a third is in prison 
diplomats stationed in rangoon have described the election as a 
cynical exercise by heavyhanded military rulers but some analysts 
feel it will create a form of party politics that may evolve slowly 
toward democracy 
the military junta which brutally suppressed a prodemocracy 
uprising in 1988 has allowed scores of parties to form since and 
promises the election will be free and fair 
more than 2300 candidates independents and representatives of 
93 parties are running for the 485 parliament seats election 
officials say 18900 voting stations will be provided and ballots 
will be counted in the presence of candidates representatives 
critics point out that however scrupulous the attention to 
election rules most of burma is under martial law many opposition 
politicians have been arrested and outsiders are not welcome 
burma has not approved applications by foreign correspondents to 
report on the election and on may 15 even stopped issuing visas 
to tourists 
there is no freedom of speech there is no freedom of 
assembly said one diplomat in the burmese capital who like 
others here would discuss the situation only if granted anonymity 
under those particular restrictions it is already not a free and 
fair election it is farcical that those the people want to vote 
for are not in the election 
aung san suu kyi the most popular opposition leader was placed 
under house arrest in july 1989 for alleged violations of security 
laws the other main leader of her national league for democracy 
tin oo is serving a threeyear prison term 
former prime minister u nu burmas last democratically elected 
leader was put under house arrest in december u nu now 84 was 
ousted in a 1962 coup led by gen ne win 
despite arrests of its leaders and some internal rifts the 
national league for democracy is clearly the most popular party in 
the election it is one of six to enter candidates for more than 
100 of the parliament seats 
the partys popularity is due in large measure to ms suu kyi 
daughter of burmese independence hero aung san she emerged as a 
brave charismatic leader during the democracy movement of 1988 
the league and other parties have held some rallies but their 
focus is on party organization and doortodoor efforts rather than 
public display 
security is tight in rangoon but western diplomats do not 
forsee a replay of the 1988 uprising when soldiers shot down 
several thousand demonstrators in the capital 
burmas numerous rebel groups including students who fled the 
repression are known to have plans to disrupt voting in more 
remote areas 
the national league for democracys main opponent is the 
national unity party the richest and best organized political 
group it is the successor of the burma socialist program party 
the militarybacked orgnization that controlled the country for 26 
years and led it to economic ruin 
four other opposition parties are considered to have some 
popular backing but burmese political analysts say none will win a 
parliamentary majority unless the election is manipulated that 
means a coalition 
the ruling military council led by gen saw maung has said it 
will not relinquish power until a government is formed and a new 
constitution written which is expected to take some time 
its all set up the government is going to pull all the 
strings josef silverstein a leading american scholar on burma 
said in an interview from the united states 
i think they could tell you today what the vote is going to be 
like theyre now trying to figure out how to divide the votes 
among the parties 
other foreign analysts stress preelection maneuvering and 
intimidation by the generals rather than possible rigging of the 
vote 
amnesty international the human rights group based in london 
accused burmese authorities of rounding up hundreds of people 
possibly thousands and said torture was widespread 
many diplomats believe one motive for relocating about 500000 
people from cities into the countryside was to have better control 
of the election 
there is no rule of law one said the big question is if 
the burmese will really dare vote for the opposition parties

scentists today reported the discovery of what 
may be the missing link between human and certain primate 
versions of the aids virus 
however the finding does not resolve the question of whether 
the aids virus originated in humans or in animals the researchers 
said 
genetic analysis of a recently found chimpanzee virus shows it 
is more closely related to the human aids virus than it is to other 
aidsrelated monkey viruses scientists from gabon and the pasteur 
institute in paris reported in the british journal nature 
the virus was identified in two wild chimpanzees in gabon it is 
classified as a lentivirus the same category that includes hiv1 
which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the united 
states 
other lentiviruses called simian immunodeficiency viruses or 
sivs have been found in four kinds of monkeys macaques sooty 
mangabeys african green monkeys and mandrills 
analysis of the new virus showed it was the first nonhuman 
lentivirus to contain the same overall genetic structure as hiv1 
the researchers reported and when the protein products of its 
genes were studied they were more like those of hiv1 than those 
of the simian viruses tested 
nonetheless when compared to the range of known genetic 
variants of hiv1 the chimp virus lay outside that range the 
researchers said they suggested it might be called chimpanzee 
immunodeficiency virus 
it is not possible to conclude that the chimp virus was a 
precursor to hiv1 and even if it were analysis indicates that it 
could not be the immediate precursor they said 
further study may shed light on whether the aids virus 
originated in people or came from an animal virus a primate 
specialist observed in an accompanying editorial 
the virus may be a form of missing link between the african 
old world primate viruses and the aids virus wrote ronald 
desrosiers of the new england regional primate research center in 
southborough mass

election day in burma will be the 312th 
day of house arrest for a former housewife and academic who most 
analysts believe could lead her party to victory if she were free 
do to so 
until two years ago aung san suu kyi was virtually unknown 
today she is the countrys most popular political figure 
when the gemerals put her under house arrest july 20 1989 they 
hoped to silence their most vocal critic it didnt work 
she has now become more or less a martyr figure said a 
burmese expatriate in bangkok she embodies everything the 
burmese people aspire to 
ms suu kyi 44 is graceful and articulate she emerged as the 
star of burmas hazardous political stage less than two years ago 
at the height of a national uprising for democracy that was 
brutally crushed 
her father aung san is revered in burma as the leader of the 
movement for independence from british rule he was assassinated in 
1947 and burma achieved formal independence jan 4 1948 
other dissidents were cowed into silence by the armys ferocity 
but ms suu kyi refused to bow to the junta that took control in 
september 1988 
soldiers killed thousands of dissidents that year and thousands 
more have been arrested since ms suu kyi said she sometimes was 
threatened but she continued criticizing the juntas human rights 
abuses and campaigning for democracy 
she is the antithesis of ne win the reclusive general who ruled 
burma from 1962 to 1988 and is the only burmese politician who has 
dared attack him openly 
everyone knows who was responsible for all the bad things in 
burma but she was the first to blame ne win said a burmese 
no one had the guts to do that before 
ms suu kyi had lived abroad since she was 15 and happened into 
politics by chance when she returned home to nurse her dying mother 
she studied at oxford university and married an english academic 
in 1972 later she began an academic career of her own and worked 
for the united nations 
the political program of her national league for democracy is 
vague but ms suu kyi has referred in many speeches to the 
nonviolent liberation movements led by mohandas k gandhi of india 
and dr martin luther king jr in the united states 
before her detention tens of thousands of people defied martial 
law and heavily armed soldiers to hear her speak 
after being put under house arrest she began a hunger strike to 
demand humane treatment for imprisoned supporters she took only 
liquids for nearly two weeks until the government gave guarantees 
martin luther king said to the people i have a dream she 
told a reporter last year well it is the same with us we just 
want to bring our dreams to reality

a federal judge on thursday threw out a deal for 
the government to pay manuel noriegas heavy legal fees setting up 
a showdown over 20 million in assets confiscated from the deposed 
panamanian dictator 
us district judge william hoeveler said federal law on defense 
spending limits would not permit the 250 to 350anhour fee for 
each of noriegas five attorneys in the drug trafficking case the 
federal cap is 60to 75anhour for only one attorney the judge 
said 
the failure of the agreement reached monday means the us 
attorneys office must quickly justify the us governments 
seizure of 27 accounts linked to noriega who claims he has no 
money for his legal defense 
we do have a constitutional dueprocess problem and i think we 
recognize that said hoeveler 
us attorney dexter lehtinen suggested the judge could declare 
the spending cap unconstitutional but noted the prosecution had 
taken no position supporting or opposing the higher fees wanted by 
the defense 
lead defense attorney frank rubino said it was absurd for the 
government to expect one defense attorney to handle the complex 
noriega case defense team members had threatened to withdraw 
because they werent being paid for their work 
rubino noted that up to two dozen federal prosecutors were 
working to convict noriega and intend to spend almost 40 million 
in their effort 
i think in all sincerity and honesty it would make a mockery 
of due process said rubino i find that to be ludicrous 
claiming noriega had income not linked to drugs rubino said 
noriega had his army salary legitimate business interests in 
panama and 11 million in secret payments from us intelligence 
agencies 
an angry rubino accused the government of sandbagging the 
defense in effect declaring legal war on the prosecutors 
we shall litigate every dime gen noriegas been paid by this 
government and we shall litigate it as publicly as we possibly 
can rubino said 
lehtinen confirmed thursday that his office submitted a ledger 
of us government payments to noriega the prosecution maintains 
that amount is significantly less than the defense estimates 
hoeveler agreed to quickly settle the defense payment dispute 
lehtinen argued the prosecution was handicapped by foreign 
governments claims on noriegas assets and because noriega has 
never admitted to earning the money 
the us attorney noted that 58 million seized in noriegas 
quarters in panama has been handed over to the new panamanian 
government 
but the defense claims the us government had no right to give 
that money to panamanian authorities without a full legal hearing 
the deal for the government to pay noriega legal fees began to 
unravel when attorneys questioned the plan saying there were no 
provisions for it under federal law 
almost as soon as the deal was announced michael okane a 
defense attorney for noriega codefendent daniel miranda wrote the 
us comptroller of the currency demanding he determine if the 
payments were proper 
the conservative washington legal foundation also wrote hoeveler 
protesting the fees 
us rep vic fazio dcalif also denounced the deal 
noriega is jailed in the metropolitan correctional center 
outside of miami where he was taken after surrendering to us 
troops in panama on jan 4 two weeks after they invaded the 
country 
he is charged in a february 1988 indictment with turning panama 
into a way station for colombias medellin drug cartel accepting 
46 million in bribes to allow them to process and ship cocaine to 
the united states through his country

the founder and leader of a hare 
krishna community was indicted by a federal grand jury thursday in 
an alleged scheme to murder kidnap and beat his followers 
authorities said 
keith ham 54 also known as kirthanananda swami bhaktipada was 
named on five counts of racketeering and conspiracy to commit 
murder and six counts of mail fraud the indictment was handed up 
by a special grand jury in elkins 
one of the racketeering counts alleges a conspiracy involving 
the death of stephen bryant a dissident member of the krishna 
community who was shot on a los angeles street in may 1986 
thomas a drescher a former resident of bhaktipadas new 
vrindaban community in marshall county has been charged with 
bryants murder and is awaiting trial in los angeles 
bryant was killed after he launched a oneman crusade against 
new vrindaban accusing bhaktipada and other commune leaders of 
drug trafficking prostitution and child abuse 
bhaktipada was expelled in 1987 from the mainstream hare krishna 
movement which is cooperating with authorities investigating the 
community said ravindra svarupa leader of the international 
society for krishna consciousness in philadelphia 
ravindra called bhaktipadas community a splinter group and said 
he was expelled for violating principles established by hare 
krishna founder bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada 
theyve deeply embarrassed us in many ways ravindra said 
the international society oversees 46 hare krishna centers in 
the united states and canada there are more than 250 hare krishna 
centers worldwide said spokesman mukunda goswami 
bhaktipada was in bombay india on thursday and not immediately 
available for comment according to gadadhar das a new vrindaban 
spokesman 
bhaktipada will return to west virginia within the next few 
days thats all i can say gadadhar said 
us attorney william kolibash said the indictment was the 
result of a twoyear probe into the community which once was among 
the largest krishna communities in the united states 
he refused to discuss details of the indictment until a news 
conference friday in wheeling 
bhaktipada the son of a baptist minister founded new 
vrindaban located about 80 miles southwest of pittsburgh among 
the hills outside of moundsville 21 years ago 
at one time in the early 1980s his permanent devotees at the 
compound numbered about 700 gadadhar said 
also named in the indictment were terry sheldon 31 also known 
as mr scam and tapahpunja steven fitzpatrick 36 also known as 
sundarakara new vrindaban community inc govardhan inc and the 
cathedral of healing inc 
the indictment alleges that bhaktipada sheldon and others 
have engaged in numerous acts of racketeering and other criminal 
acts to protect keith gordon ham bhaktipada and themselves from 
internal opponents and to demonstrate to bhaktipadas devotees 
that bhaktipada had and would exercise ultimate power over his 
devotees 
accordingly defendant keith gordon ham has authorized 
murders kidnappings and beatings of devotees the indictment 
said 
moreover in addition to instructing devotees to commit mail 
frauds keith gordon ham has also commanded devotees to impede law 
enforcement investigations related to the new vrindaban community

alex is 13 going on 2 and talks numbers 
colors and even turkey with his trainer a researcher who hopes her 
work with the african gray parrot someday may help autistic 
children 
in conversation with trainer irene pepperberg of northwestern 
university alexs lexicon includes 80 of his favorite things and 
some of his notsofavorite 
alex mimicks her boston accent spewing comments that recall big 
birds wiseguy chattering oscar the grouchs grumbling ets 
longing for home 
one moment alex is humble as the next parrot saying simply 
wanna cracker the next moment he might be brassier 
declaring youre a turkey possibly when some human tries his 
patience 
ms pepperberg a visiting assistant professor of anthropology 
works eight hours a day training the bird of a species known for 
its ability to mimic a huge variety of sounds 
alex is no birdbrain his remarks and responses seem 
appropriate to the situation 
for instance when hungry he might mumble lazily wanna 
cracker 
offered a choice of corn a grape or a nut during recent visit 
alex knew the difference with the demanding tone of an old man who 
gets everything from his slippers to his supper catered alex 
declared i want cracker 
but does the parrot really know what hes saying 
alexs speech isnt language and im not trying to claim it 
is ms pepperberg said 
he has the ability to reproduce the sounds of speech he 
understands the concepts she said for instance he uses words 
like rock and key when he cant see the object but seems 
to want it 
the parrot began saying youre a turkey in situations 
where ms pepperberg believes he is frustrated after hearing 
frustrated students use the expression 
she said the technique she uses to train alex might someday be 
used with children including the autistic who fail to form 
relationships with others 
the idea of understanding how another form of intelligence 
works will help us understand how all forms of intelligence 
works she said wednesday 
thomas zentall a university of kentucky psychology professor 
has researched animal cognition pepperbergs procedures may be 
the critical way in which autistic children learn language he 
said 
researchers now dont know how children normally learn language 
skills and dont know how to teach those who have trouble 
communicating he said 
ms pepperberg uses a modeling technique alex watches as she 
shows objects such as toys keys paper or nails to a student and 
pronounces the word the student repeats the word and is rewarded 
with the object 
then she takes alex through the procedure rewarding him each 
time he succeeds 
she asks how many keys shes holding 
two alex correctly replies 
she holds two objects one square the other round whats 
different 
shape he responds 
but sometimes a testy alex emerges bored with the same old 
games he skips the right answer as he spills off a list of colors 
or retorts you tell me what color 
these birds have the personality of a 2yearold said ms 
pepperburg he obviously has a short attention span evidenced 
by the keys rocks grapes and nuts hes strewn over her laboratory 
floor 
among alexs simple sentences 
i want showah to be sprayed with water 
i want to go back indicating a yearning to return to his 
cage where alex prances along the edges as if he were a highwire 
acrobat whistles a loud if not pretty tune nervously scratches 
his feathers and watches to make sure he has an attentive audience 
zentall noted researchers reluctance to describe alexs skills 
as language we havent really developed a good definition of 
language he said humans do it and animals dont and now 
animals are infringing on this

residents of this village are 
tired of the screeching and thundering from the soviet military air 
base in their midst and they are waging a lively campaign to get 
it closed 
a soviet warplane that accidentally dropped three bombs on a 
neighboring village has added new fuel to the 2yearold campaign 
which has gone public since the fall of east germanys communist 
regime 
thousands of demonstrators converged at the airfield this week 
and a protest letter to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will 
soon be on its way 
we think its shocking that despite huge political changes 
war is still being waged over our town said pastor heinz joachim 
karau who organized mondays protest of between 5000 and 8000 
residents estimates vary 
more than 7200 people have signed a petition demanding closure 
of the base in neuruppin home to 22000 people and about an hours 
drive northwest of berlin 
while government leaders debate the likely pullout of us and 
soviet troops from central europe residents of neuruppin say noise 
from the soviet base has driven them crazy for years 
windows rattle houses shake hospital patients are frightened 
one doctor said children are subjected to possible mental 
disturbances from the fighter jet and helicopter noise 
they say this is one of the noisiest areas in all of europe 
said 61yearold guenter knoerr a retired butcher 
knoerr his soninlaw and his grandchildren were among those 
who took part in the protest at the base which is just outside the 
town center 
when the migs started up the kids came screaming into the 
house said another protester who used to live next to the base 
during the demonstration about 150 people raced onto the 
runway where they briefly confronted soviet soldiers the march 
included mothers pushing baby carriages and young children riding 
on their fathers shoulders 
we live right near the airfield and we just cant stand it 
the windows rattle when the planes go by we cant even really 
watch television said knoerrs 63yearold wife marga 
on wednesday a soviet warplane swooped in for a landing just 
above a moderately busy street 
residents are well aware their protests would have landed them 
in jail as recently as last fall 
a massive secret police network kept residents in check under 
the regime of former communist party boss erich honecker ousted in 
octobers peaceful revolution 
before honeckers fall neuruppin residents worked out a scheme 
to make their longstanding grievances known since petitions to the 
government were forbidden in december 1987 churchgoers wrote to 
their pastors 
the clerics then passed the letters of protest to the local 
soviet commander who responded with a onepage letter offering no 
hope of change 
we thought it was all in vain said lutheran church pastor 
karau in his cluttered study with a large crucifix on the wall 
then four days after the berlin wall opened in november 10000 
people gathered for a protest march 
that was followed by another march in january when protesters 
hung banners saying ivan arent you homesick and 
playgrounds instead of landing grounds 
mondays demonstration came just four days after bombs were 
accidentally dropped on the neighboring village of raegelin no one 
was injured and the bombs did not explode but two of them ripped 
through a barn roof and a third slammed to the ground near a lake 
where young people were sitting 
soviet officials said the accident was due to an electrical 
failure 
the bombs fell at just the right time said karau 62 the 
demonstrators were really fired up 
he said that so far the soviets have only trimmed back the 
number of late night flights the aircraft land and take off from 
6 am until midnight residents said 
the airfield would be a great place for huge rock n roll 
youth festival karau said with a smile

portauprince haiti ap a surge in violent crime by armed 
gangs is spreading fear among haitians and threatening the new 
civilian governments plans for democratic elections this year 
we are not going to go blindly to the ballot box we must have 
a minimum of security said emmanuel ambroise human rights 
representative on the ninemember electoral council organizing the 
vote 
the crime wave which erupted the weekend before the electoral 
council was installed may 2 is likely to be one of the items 
discussed when president ertha pascaltrouillot meets thursday with 
president bush at the white house 
the surge in violence may threaten democratic reform a 
condition for the resumption of full us aid to the impoverished 
caribbean nation 
congress suspended 60 million in annual aid after the last 
attempt to hold independent presidential elections on nov 29 
1987 collapsed in a bloodbath thugs in collusion with the army 
shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at polling stations 
mrs pascaltrouillot has pledged democratic elections as soon 
as they can be arranged possibly by september she took office as 
head of a caretaker government march 13 after military ruler lt 
gen prosper avril fled into exile following widespread protests of 
his government 
the elections if carried out would give haiti its first 
democratically elected president in its 186year history 
but the crime wave is undermining confidence in the governments 
ability to provide security during the vote 
heavily armed gangs sometimes as many as eight in a group have 
been brazenly holding up stores during the day and breaking into 
houses and robbing motorists at night 
gunfire is heard almost nightly piles of flaming tires send 
foulsmelling smoke billowing into the air poisoning the 
atmosphere antigovernment graffiti has begun to crop up 
a restaurant owner in the affluent suburb of petionville said 
people seem afraid to go out at night the last weekend in april 
business was so good he was turning people away at the door and 
then people got scared 
only about four tables of several dozen were occupied the night 
he spoke 
the violence recalls an army terror campaign in the months 
leading up to the 1987 election day massacre 
it is not easy to mobilize a people for elections when 
elections immediately conjure up the idea of a massacre said 
louis dejoie jr a prominent politician who has called for a 
special police task force and international supervision of the 
elections 
every time there is a glimmer of democratic hope the enemies 
of democracy try to put it out said dr louis roy coauthor of 
haitis 1987 constitution and president of a 19member council of 
state it governs along with mrs pascaltrouillot a former 
supreme court justice 
when mrs pascaltrouillot was inaugurated the armys chief of 
staff lt gen herard abraham publicly placed the military under 
her command 
but doubt persists that the undisciplined 6000man force will 
give up the privileges acquired under successive military regimes 
since the ouster of dictator jeanclaude duvalier in february 1986 
although some of the crime may not be politically motivated 
many believe the army is doing little to prevent it 
the rev jeanbertrand aristide a radical roman catholic priest 
with a huge following among the poor said the crime wave only 
confirmed his suspicion that the army opposes democratic elections 
police officials in the capital of portauprince say their 
illequipped 800man force cannot guarantee security in a city of 
1 million inhabitants 
crime in the countryside goes largely unpunished and is often 
committed by government officials in collusion with army agents 
the council of state has called for reform of the rural police 
system constantly denounced by peasant groups as repressive 
the government meanwhile is faced with an economy battered by 
corruption and mismanagement under the 18month avril regime 
an expected budget deficit of 12 million turned out be 21 
million the new government was forced to cut 13 million from this 
years 290 million budget 
during its first two months in power the pascaltrouillot 
government has received about 71 million in loans and gifts from 
international donors 
the us government encouraged by democratic reform and 
progress on human rights has granted 18 million in the food for 
peace program but only 6 million will be available before 
october the state department has urged congress to give 13 
million more 3 million of which is to be used for election

all in the name of science 24 young men sat 
around a college dormitory for 3 months and watched tv played 
cards and ate 
and ate and ate 
when it was over they had provided some of the clearest 
evidence yet of one of natures injustices some people can overeat 
without putting on much weight but for others every extra calorie 
goes straight to the waistline 
moreover the study suggested a reason why and it strengthened 
the case that heredity plays a major role in whether people get fat 
it seems that some peoples bodies store extra calories mostly 
as fat while others tend to make new muscle and because 
manufacturing lean tissue is not a very energy efficient process 
the muscle makers put on less weight 
the men tested were 12 sets of identical twins six of every 
seven days for 100 days each of them ate 1000 more calories than 
their bodies need 
some put on three times as much weight as others 
the twins are genetically identical and this similarity was 
reflected in the way they added weight if one twin put on a lot of 
weight so did his brother the study found three times more 
variation in weight gain among pairs than within pairs 
there were also similarities in the way twins deposited their 
fat whether they tended to grow potbellies or big bottoms 
the study was conducted by dr claude bouchard at laval 
university in ste foy quebec it was published in todays new 
england journal of medicine along with another study on twins by 
dr albert j stunkard and others at the university of pennsylvania 
an editorial by dr ethan ah sims of the university of vermont 
described the two reports as landmark contributions he said 
they show that destiny in the form of our genetic makeup has a 
great deal to do with the shape of our middles 
in the laval study the man who gained the most weight put on 29 
pounds and stored up every extra calorie somewhere on his body the 
man who gained the least added nine pounds and stored only 40 
percent of the extra calories 
it demonstrates for the first time that for a given amount of 
calories you have differences in the bodys response to the 
surplus of energy said bouchard the individual differences 
are amazing they are huge 
he said almost 40 percent of the weight gain is explained by the 
individuals propensity to store calories in lean tissue or in fat 
this is the single most important variable that has been 
presented in the literature to account for differences in weight 
gain he said 
the pennsylvania research examined 673 sets of identical and 
fraternal twins in sweden about half of the sets were raised 
together the rest had been separated at birth 
the researchers found that genes could explain most of the 
difference in peoples weights although there was a slight sex 
difference genetic influences accounted for 70 percent of the 
differences in fatness among men and 66 percent in women 
their childhood home environments had no effect at all on 
whether they grew up to be heavy or slim four years ago the same 
group found that twins who had been put up for adoption grew to 
have the body builds of their biological parents not the people 
who raised them

new yorks republican leaders still without 
a candidate a week before their convention turned wednesday to two 
familiar wall street figures as potential challengers to gov mario 
cuomo 
investment counselor john loeb jr and economist pierre rinfret 
both were approached by party kingmakers 
the new york times reported in its thursday editions that 
rinfret was the choice of gop chairman j patrick barrett and a 
group of party leaders party officials werent available late 
wednesday to confirm the report they had decided to back rinfret 
for the nomination 
rinfret said through a spokeswoman that he had yet to accept the 
offer of leadership support in a bid to carry the partys banner 
against cuomo a twoterm democrat 
cuomo considered a potential 1992 presidential contender is 
expected to announce his reelection bid within days the state 
democratic convention begins a week from monday 
the gop convention opens may 29 
rinfret who was an unpaid economic adviser to presidents 
kennedy johnson and nixon in the 1960s and 1970s heads rinfret 
associates an economic consulting firm in new york city 
a spokeswoman for the 66yearold economist said nothing 
definite had been decided 
as far as hes concerned there are still issues to be 
discussed debbie ishlon said late wednesday night its not 
definitely determined that he would be a candidate 
ishlon said rinfret has spoken to state sen roy goodman of 
manhattan and barrett about running against cuomo he has 
expressed an interest she said but there are still many 
issues that they are discussing 
loeb said wednesday hes been having conversations with the 
leaders of the republican party about running for governor 
loeb who served as former president reagans ambassador to 
copenhagen from 198183 said he hadnt decided whether he wanted 
to seek the nomination 
an aide to state gop chairman j patrick barrett said her boss 
had met with loeb on wednesday in new york city 
pat found him to be very intelligent and articulate said 
barrett aide elizabeth deltorto of loeb 
barrett has been searching for almost a year to find a credible 
cuomo opponent thus far hes been turned down by one wellknown 
republican after another 
the latest republican to keep his hat out of the ring is former 
state gop chairman richard rosenbaum 
im not going to do it the rochester lawyer said wednesday 
rosenbaum said he wouldnt run in large part because he didnt 
have the 5 million he said was the minimum needed to mount a 
credible campaign 
thats a million dollars a month to raise thats a monumental 
task he said 
loeb the son of a wealthy banker and financier has money and 
some knowledge of new york state government he served as a special 
adviser on environmental matters to thengov nelson rockefeller 
from 196773 
loeb 60 said he was very honored to be one of several being 
considered for the nomination 
aha 25 million dollars they made the phone call said 
cuomo when told about loeb i told you that if i run i have to 
go out and get a lot of money because they will come up with a 
fortune 
cuomo who already has more than 7 million in his campaign war 
chest has long maintained that republicans will raise at least 25 
million to defeat him this year 
cuomo made the same claim in 1986 that year however 
republican candidate andrew orourke was able to raise only 13 
million cuomo spending 68 million easily won reelection to a 
second term 
at the moment the only announced candidate for the gop 
gubernatorial nomination is littleknown rockland county insurance 
broker herbert holland he has never run for office before and has 
little support among the states gop leadership holland has 
proposed among other things that all new yorkers be tested for 
drugs when they seek to renew their drivers licenses

south korean president roh taewoos trip to japan 
has stirred up hard feelings from japans militaristic past 
sentiments that extend throughout much of asias pacific rim 
a major aim of the threeday state visit which began early 
thursday with rohs arrival is to ease past animosities but the 
trip has provoked debate over japans lingering responsibility for 
its 191045 colonial rule of the korean peninsula 
japanese extremist groups opposed to roh have set off explosives 
to destroy korean buildings and cars owned by japanese government 
officials 
in seoul protests against rohs visit culminated wednesday in a 
ritual suicide attempt a 34yearold man demanding the japanese 
emperor apologize for japans past actions stabbed himself outside 
the japanese embassy hospital officials said the man was in stable 
condition 
bands of elderly koreans protest daily outside the embassy in 
seoul demanding compensation for the hundreds of thousands of 
koreans who were forced to fight and work for wartime japan 
elsewhere in asia too memories of hardships under japanese 
rule still hinder efforts to leave the past behind such lingering 
bitterness would make it hard for japan to claim a leading 
political role in the region despite its great wealth 
according to international law japans legal responsibility 
for the war has been fulfilled said kisaburo yokota a law 
professor at the international christian university in tokyo but 
especially in korea as well as china and other countries public 
feelings are still strong they feel japan hasnt reflected 
thoroughly on its past actions 
japanese power struck first in korea before world war ii 
japans military empire extended from manchuria to burma through 
southeast asia to the philippines in the south pacific and to the 
aleutians 
south korean officials have said they expect a clear apology for 
japans colonial rule preferably from emperor akihito during 
rohs visit 
but for japan such an apology would raise questions about the 
emperors role under the postwar constitution and about how much 
responsibility akihitos father the late emperor hirohito had for 
japans wartime actions 
prime minister toshiki kaifu in remarks to parliament has 
characterized japan as the aggressor in the war and vowed to 
express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and apologize 
for them 
but some governing party politicians said japan should not 
prostrate itself in apology their views are shared by 
rightwing extremists who glorify the imperial family and view the 
demand for an apology as an insult 
the division of the korean peninsula is a legacy of japans 
colonization and rohs visit gave communist north korea a chance 
to blast him for bringing shame and humiliation to our nation 
much as the two germanys relations with other european 
countries are affected by lingering memories of world war ii 
japans legacy of aggression has left wounds in asia 
japanese officials often seem torn however over the need to 
balance sensitivity with national pride 
the government has heard repeated asian protests over 
euphemistic descriptions of wartime atrocities in history 
textbooks and several cabinet members have been forced to resign 
after defending japans militaristic past 
japan was reluctant to criticize china after the harsh crackdown 
in june on prodemocracy protesters in beijing the reason given by 
japanese officials was japans invasion of china 50 years ago 
tokyos relations with seoul are complicated by discriminatory 
treatment of 680000 koreans living in japan many of them 
descendants of forced laborers 
japanese officials have said they hoped the visit only the 
second by a south korean leader would allow them to put the past 
well behind them 
but analysts say that apologies and agreements will not halt the 
antagonism 
its an emotional problem so it will take time to resolve 
it yokota said thats why its so important for japan to do 
all it can to resolve it as soon as possible

they die on lonely streets in shelters and in 
empty apartments with no friends or kin to shed tears of grief 
but thanks to earl lewis the hundreds of men and women who die 
penniless homeless or friendless each year in cook county are 
honored in a memorial service designed to add dignity to their 
deaths 
im just a concerned christian citizen who feels that more 
recognition should be given to the unknown and forgotten members of 
our community lewis said before wednesdays service 
the names of 170 men and women who died forgotten over the past 
seven months were read during a service at the chicago temple a 
united methodist church 
we come today to remember the names of those who died unknown 
to anybody but god the rev eugene winkler the temples pastor 
said to open the 45minute service 
about 130 people attended among them was ruth reinhardt a 
30yearold businesswoman 
if you can take half an hour or 45 minutes to think about it 
and pray for the situation maybe it will get better she 
said 
lewis an administrative assistant for an insurance agency 
wouldnt say what led him to create the services but he hinted 
hes known hard times 
i know what it means to feel as though youve been forgotten 
you dont matter you dont belong he said 
the cook county medical examiners office provides lewis with 
the names of those whose bodies arent claimed after about two 
months it also pays for a mass burial held every other month at a 
cemetery in suburban homewood 
many of the forgotten have died on the streets from exposure or 
other effects of a hard life others outlive their relatives and 
friends and die at home of old age with no money for a proper 
burial said winkler 
since lewis organized chicagos first memorial five years ago 
when about 50 people were honored the number of people 
memorialized twice a year at area churches has more than tripled 
les brown executive director of the nonprofit coalition for 
the homeless said about 40000 people became destitute and 
homeless in chicago in the past 12 months and the number is 
increasing about 25 percent a year 
many of them are basically alone or have lost contact with 
loved ones and friends and many of them end up without any ritual 
passing at all brown said and thats a very sad commentary on 
what this society does with its disenfranchised

a man who has spent 20 years as a quadriplegic 
hooked to a respirator wants to be allowed to die because he fears 
his adopted father and sole caretaker will go first 
kenneth a bergstedt 31 whose 65yearold adopted father has 
high blood pressure and other ailments has asked a state court to 
let doctors unhook him from his lifesupport system 
his attorney jack cherry said bergstedt fears being 
institutionalized 
what would happen to him then he said 
his quality of life is zero cherry said lying on a 
gurney for 20 years and only being able to move your head is a 
terrible way to live 
cherry said he will present witnesses at a june 8 hearing to 
show that bergstedt is mentally competent and will never regain use 
of his body 
the lawyer said he wants a judge to declare that bergstedt has a 
right to refuse lifesustaining treatment and that his decision 
will not be regarded as suicide he is also asking for a 
declaration that anyone who helps him shut off the respirator or 
gives him a sedative will not be prosecuted 
the district attorneys office has said it wont argue against 
bergstedts wishes its our conclusion that its a decision that 
has to be made between a patient and a doctor said bill koot 
chief of the offices criminal division 
in court papers bergstedt said he is afraid his father who has 
cared for him around the clock since his adopted mother died 12 
years ago will die and leave him alone 
he said he is also afraid his lifesupport system will 
malfunction someday when no one is around causing an agonizing 
suffocating death 
cherry described both men as very private people who have 
declined to speak publicly about their plight the father is very 
supportive of his son and will go along with whatever his son wants 
to do the attorney said 
bergstedt said he severed his spinal cord at age 10 when a young 
girl doing a cannonball dive landed on him in a public swimming 
pool in indiana 
he said he has no happy or encouraging expectations to look 
for from life receives no enjoyment from life lives with constant 
fears and apprehensions and is tired of suffering 
his entertainment consists of reading watching television or 
writing poetry on a computer controlled by puffs of breath

president bush is grappling with a pair of 
domestic policy decisions one on offshore oil and the other on 
civil rights seen as tests of his true commitment to a kinder 
and gentler america 
in both cases bush is faced with taking aggressive actions 
allowing or blocking coastal oil drilling and signing or vetoing 
civil rights legislation that will force him from the 
fencestraddling stance he has thus far embraced 
how bush handles these electionyear issues also promises 
political ramifications for his administration which has made a 
concerted effort to convert two key constituency groups 
environmentalists and blacks 
bushs decision is expected within days on whether to open three 
areas for offshore oil exploration one off south florida and two 
off northern and southern california 
at the same time he is consulting advisers and interest groups 
on how to handle the pending civil rights act of 1990 written to 
thwart six supreme court job discrimination decisions that were 
seen as weakening earlier civil rights advances 
in both cases the phrase litmus test has been applied to 
characterize the importance of his decision 
green issues are high on everyones list of importance 
said michael fischer executive director of the sierra club who 
cited polls showing growing environmental awareness especially in 
california the offshore oil decision along with bushs position 
on global warming and oil exploration in the arctic national 
wildlife reserve are top priorities for environmentalists said 
fischer 
bush a former texas oilman proclaims himself the 
environmental president but environmentalists have been 
dismayed by his willingness to open the arctic national wildlife 
reserve to oil exploration and they decry his insistence on more 
study of how gaseous emissions warm the earth in lieu of aggressive 
policies against global warming 
civil rights advocates meanwhile are looking for bush to prove 
himself by signing the pending legislation that has strong 
bipartisan backing 
this is the first major substantive civil rights test for the 
bush administration said ralph neas director of the national 
leadership conference on civil rights 
while welcoming bushs procivil rights statements the civil 
rights community thus far has been very disappointed by 
several actions of the bush justice department 
theres no question that a veto of the civil rights act of 
1990 would have an adverse impact on the presidents popularity 
with minorities and all those who care about civil rights neas 
added 
bush proclaims he will tolerate no barriers to civil rights but 
says he will not sign any bill that could lead to minority hiring 
quotas in this case even a bill that does not directly call for 
quotas 
even after senate republicans recently worked out a compromise 
with democrats to change language that conservatives said would 
cause employers to impose minority hiring quotas the white house 
still balked 
on the offshore oil matter the president has not signalled his 
decision except to call for a balanced approach 
he says he wants to protect environmentally sensitive coastal 
areas but not foreclose oil exploration that could decrease the 
nations dependence on foreign oil 
this bothsidesofthecoin approach has become a bush trademark 
on other kindergentler issues as well most recently a 
controversy over saving the northern spotted owl in oregon 
not wanting to anger environmentalists bush said he wants to 
protect the owl but he also said that should not be done at the 
expense of timberindustry jobs that would be lost by preserving 
the forest lands needed to save the bird 
kindergentler advocates also cite the parental leave issue 
the president says he backs having employers voluntarily provide 
unpaid leave for family emergencies but he has threatened to veto 
legislation that would require companies to do just that

max baucus remembers well the surprise 
defeat that montana voters dealt fellow democratic sen john 
melcher in 1988 and hes maneuvering early to avoid a similar fate 
the twoterm senator faces little challenge in the democratic 
primary on june 5 but hes amassing a stash of campaign cash to 
combat the winner of the fourway republican primary 
baucus has raised about 2 million for what he expects will be a 
25 million campaign the most expensive in the history of rural 
montana 
two years ago the national republican senatorial committee 
pumped 205000 into the state gop including 138000 in the last 
month of the campaign to help challenger conrad burns overtake 
melcher 
baucus said the national gop has targeted him in hopes of a 
repeat 
republican candidates have said they and the republican 
national committee will do whatever it takes to win this seat 
baucus said 
the likely beneficiary of that republican support is unclear 
a statewide poll taken in april showed no clear leader in the 
gop race between lt gov allen kolstad and businessmanscientist 
bruce vorhauer state sen bill farrell and former business 
executive john domenech lagged behind 
in the democratic primary baucus is heavily favored over john 
driscoll a member of the state public service commission and 
billings evangelist curly thornton 
driscoll has attacked baucus for obtaining 86 percent of his 
campaign financing from outofstate interests but most of the 
debate has been among the gop candidates 
kolstad has made an issue of his lifelong ties to montana 
contrasting his background to that of vorhauer who became a state 
resident only last fall and domenech who moved to bozeman four 
years ago 
farrell has accused kolstad of not addressing the issues 
vorhauer and farrell have taken a prochoice position on abortion 
while kolstad and domenech are antiabortion 
for the most part the republicans have similar views on other 
issues and emphasize differences in style and personality 
kolstad 58 was a state legislator for 20 years and operates a 
family farm and ranch in northcentral montana he joined stan 
stephens in the 1988 gubernatorial race to become the no 2 person 
in montanas first gop administration in 20 years 
kolstad was the last to enter the senate race but yielded to 
entreaties from president bush vice president dan quayle former 
president reagan and other national gop leaders seeking a 
wellknown challenger 
farrell 41 who owns a trucking company stresses the 
bluecollar roots that he believes set him apart from the other 
candidates

after more than a decade of stalemate 
congress is close to sending sweeping clean air legislation to 
president bush 
the house by a 40121 margin approved pollution controls late 
wednesday on factories automobiles and electric power plants most 
of the most difficult disputes were worked out behind closed doors 
with little floor debate 
the senate passed a similar bill in early april and a conference 
committee is expected to work out differences perhaps as early as 
this summer 
wednesdays vote represented the first time in 13 years that the 
house acted to revamp the 1970 federal clean air law which 
environmentalists for years have said is inadequate to rid cities 
of dirty air or protect the public from toxic chemicals 
the house bill virtually breezed through after most major issues 
were resolved through bipartisan compromises in the energy and 
commerce committee 
for more than a decade the committees chairman rep john 
dingell dmich a longtime protector of auto industry interests 
had blocked clean air legislation from advancing to the floor his 
adversary in those years was rep henry waxman dcalif chairman 
of the committees environment subcommittee 
but the two congressmen engineered the lengthy private 
negotiations that led to the compromises and final passage 
talking to reporters after the vote both dingell and waxman 
gave some of the credit to president bush who last summer called 
for toughening the federal clean air laws 
the president gave the issue a high place in the national 
agenda said waxman 
we both recognize that this is the year that clean air 
legislation is going to be passed into law the california 
democrat continued 
the house bill is similar to the one passed by the senate 
although slightly tougher in some respects and weaker in others 
like the senate bill the house version calls for 
states to implement pollution reduction plans that bring their 
cities into compliance with federal air quality standards within at 
least 15 years only los angeles is given more time because the 
smog problem there is so severe 
steep reductions in acid rain pollutants from electric power 
plants the utilities must reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions 
by 10 million tons by the end of the decade 
industrial plants to install the best available technology to 
reduce toxic emissions industry reported 26 billion pounds of 
such chemicals including carcinogens were released into the air 
in 1988 the last year for which figures are available 
a reduction of smogcausing pollution from automobiles through 
tighter tailpipe emission controls cleaner fuels and a phasein 
through fleet operators of more alternativ fuel vehicles 
but in some areas the house bill goes further than either the 
senate or the white house had wanted 
over strong administration objections the house included a 
financial assistance plan for workers who lose their jobs as a 
result of tougher air pollution controls the senate rejected a 
jobloss provision for coal miners 
the 250 million fiveyear program approved by the house 
provides an additional 6 months of unemployment compensation and 
money for retraining to workers in all industries 
the house measure also opens the way for introduction of the 
most extensive use yet of automobiles that run on fuels other than 
gasoline waxman abandoned a proposal to require automakers to 
build 1 million such cars for sale in nine of the most polluted 
cities 
but a compromise measure was approved calling for a pilot 
project that he said would lead to 300000 such cars being sold 
in the los angeles area by the end of the decade it is a foot in 
the door i think the rest of the country will follow 
the automakers had vigorously resisted any production 
requirement for purely nongasoline powered cars questioning 
whether there will be a market industry sources said the 
automakers will try to scuttle even the pilot project during house 
negotiations with the senate the senate bill has no such provision 
among other measures put into the house bill during daylong 
floor action wednesday were requirements that 
cleaner gasoline blends be sold in cities with the worst 
pollution the oil industry opposed the tougher emission standards 
arguing they will require use of gasolineethanol blends ethanol 
comes from grain 
the environmental protection agency develop new regional 
visibility regulations within two years for many national parks and 
wilderness areas 
offshore oil platforms off the california coast and elsewhere 
outside the gulf of mexico adhere to federal air pollution 
regulations to please oil state congressmen platforms in the gulf 
of mexico where most offshore oil is drilled were exempted 
chemicals such as chlorofluorcarbons o cfcs as well as a 
number of substitutes that damage the atmospheric ozone layer be 
phased out under specific timetables

when research reports are likely to be harmful 
to business such as those linking passive smoke to lung cancer 
the patsy press accepts them unskeptically says an executive 
of philip morris 
the news media often become loyal to one side in a health 
dispute and lazy and uncritical of the side they support says 
guy l smith iv vice president for corporate affairs of the philip 
morris companies inc a tobacco food and beer conglomerate 
reporters and editors treat the president the senator the 
congressman the mayor and companies with great skepticism which 
is as it should be he said but let a critic of business come 
along and the media turn over their typewriters to him 
smith made his remarks wednesday in a speech entitled the 
media as patsy to a luncheon of the media institute a 
nonprofit research organization 
as a case in point he cited what he called leaks about a 
forthcoming environmental protection agency study which sources 
have said will report that passive smoke inhaled by nonsmokers 
causes more than 3000 cases of lung cancer annually 
environmental tobacco smoke is a particularly rich field for 
quack moralists to harvest bogus science smith said 
he said the epa assessment was based on 23 studies 18 of which 
found no link the other five he said were conducted in greece 
japan and china and may be invalid because they did not consider 
such factors as the effect of oils or charcoal used in cooking on 
the nonsmokers health 
judging from the early returns most of the media are going to 
lap the report up and a new number will be added to the 
antitobacco industrys hall of fame smith said 
maybe you can see what i mean about the media being lazy and 
uncritical of the side they support and becoming patsies 
asked to comment on smiths remarks reporter lewis cope of the 
minneapolis star tribune presidentelect of the national 
association of science writers said of the passive smoking 
controversy 
all the evidence is not clear on that one yet but i have a 
file here full of reports that have been done by reputable 
scientists and medical journals that have raised serious questions 
about this it would be irresponsible not to report where they 
think the evidence is heading simply because somebody in the 
industry is critical of their conclusions 
of smiths remarks generally cope said he has a right to his 
opinion but there is a need to report contrary views from reputable 
scientists particularly on matters that are so important to 
peoples health 
smith also cited a campaign against the use of highcholesterol 
tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil in baked products he 
said the press did not much publicize the role of producers of 
nontropical oils in calling attention to the potential health 
problems of tropical oils 
it subsequently turned out that not enough tropical oil was 
involved to make a health difference smith said 
but the point i want to make is that the press took at face 
value an antiindustry campaign that deserved at least a second 
look he said 
he added the health field is full of this sciencebypress 
release that turns reporters into patsies time and again 
in this country we are supposed to have newspapers not 
mythpapers smith said double standard journalism and 
sciencebypress release are compromising the integrity of the 
press

most americans hate being nickelanddimed 
but try to take away their pennies and they get downright 
centimental 
a gallup survey released wednesday showed nearly two out of 
three pennypinching americans give no quarter to an idea floating 
in congress to have cash transactions rounded off to the nearest 5 
cents 
a house banking subcommittee requested a study on the idea 
which the gallup respondents obviously considered pennyante as 
part of another bill that would replace the onedollar bill with a 
coin 
the proposal would keep pennies as legal tender to a maximum 
of 25 cents only if used in quantities divisible by 5 without 
fraction or remainder 
thats the legislative way of saying you could use up your 
pennies only in groups of five and no more than 25 at one time 
rubbish say 62 percent of the americans surveyed who find the 
idea pennywise and poundfoolish 
some people might regard the penny as a nuisance stores often 
keep a cup of pennies at the cash register so customers dont have 
to dig to the bottoms of their purses and pockets for lintcovered 
coins 
pennies no longer have much use games at penny arcades cost 50 
cents penny gumballs are still available out of drugstore 
machines few people even pitch pennies anymore 
the most common use of pennies is to help pay for items priced 
at levels not divisible by five 
but introduce a bill in congress to do away with them and 
americans begin to sound like benjamin franklin 
almost all americans recognize the penny as a historical 
example of thrift and resourcefulness the survey said with 92 
percent agreeing with the statement that the penny is a 
longstanding tradition in this country sixtytwo percent said 
they opposed its demise 
the survey commissioned by a group called americans for common 
cents also showed people have commonsense concerns for example 
how many merchants will round down their prices 
seventyseven percent said they are worried that merchants will 
raise prices to compensate for losses due to rounding 
the survey of 750 adults conducted by telephone between april 
23 and april 26 has a margin of potential sampling error of plus 
or minus 4 percent 
the pending house bill introduced last year by rep jimmy 
hayes dla calls for rounding the sales price down to the 
nearest nickel if the price ends in 1 2 6 or 7 cents the price 
would be rounded up if the sum ends in 3 4 8 or 9 cents an 
exception if someone still insisted on selling something for one 
or two pennies youd have to scrape them up not try to round down 
to zero 
the treasury still would make pennies but only for collectors 
the survey revealed that women are more loyal to the penny than 
men with 70 percent of women opposing the change and 54 percent of 
men women also were more worried about inflation caused by doing 
away with the penny 63 percent of women were very concerned 
about price hikes compared to 44 percent of men 
college graduates were less concerned about the penny than those 
who did not attend college the welltodo were less concerned than 
poorer people those who live in the south and midwest were the 
strongest supporters of the penny

former hud secretary samuel r pierce jr 
wanted to know who was behind projects seeking federal housing 
subsidies that brought big profits to consultants and developers a 
former top assistant says 
thomas demery former assistant secretary for housing and fha 
commissioner at the department of housing and urban development 
told congressional investigators wednesday that pierce asserted 
full control over the scandalridden section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program during a january 1987 meeting 
at that time i realized that political considerations were to 
be a factor in the award of mod rehab units as viewed by secretary 
pierce demery said 
demery appeared voluntarily before a house government operations 
subcommittee that has spent more than a year probing allegations of 
influencepeddling political favoritism and mismanagement at hud 
while pierce was secretary during the reagan administration 
congressional investigators viewed the testimony of demery as 
corroborating the contention earlier this month of dubois gilliam 
a former hud official now serving a prison sentence for abusing hud 
programs that pierce was actively involved in steering housing 
grants to political friends 
demery said he spent a year trying to gain control of the 
program he said he succeeded in march 1988 by gaining pierces 
support for a memo restructuring the selection process and that no 
grants awarded after that time were the result of political 
influence 
but in a meeting with pierce a year earlier he said the 
secretary told him that the section 8 renovation program was 
pierces own to run as he wanted the program provides 
lucrative grants for private developers to renovate lowincome 
housing 
in that 1987 meeting three months after demery took the job 
pierce told him that he would provide direction for the program by 
speaking through his thenexecutive assistant deborah gore dean 
dean had been providing him with scraps of paper saying 
the secretary wants these requests funded he said 
pierce appeared once before the congressional panel a year ago 
and denied making funding decisions under the program or ordering 
grants for political friends pierce invoked his 5th amendment 
rights and refused to testify again a special prosecutor is 
investigating his handling of the moderate rehabilitation program 
dean and her predecessor as pierces top assistant lance 
wilson have also invoked their constitutional rights in refusing 
to testify 
demery came under some harsh questioning by members of the 
panel however 
it strikes me you were a participant just like the rest of 
them at that time rep chris shays rconn said you would 
have to have been really out in left field not to know what was 
going on at hud 
demery acknowledged meeting with several consultants who secured 
hud moderate rehabilitation grants for projects committee 
investigators distributed documents found in demerys hud computer 
files listing political supporters or consultants backing 18 
requests for hud grants six of them eventually received money 
including four who had contacts with demery 
a hud inspector generals report released in early 1989 focused 
on demery and a pattern of contributions by hudconnected 
developers and consultants to his favorite charity food for 
africa which distributes food in mozambique that report began 
unraveling the broader hud scandal involving influencepeddling and 
political favoritism 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the panel said there was 
no evidence food for africa was anything less than a legitimate 
charity or that demery profited from it 
but demery faced some disbelieving questioning when he contended 
he did not know who was contributing to the charity

with a bit more push farm income nationally 
could set records this year according to a new analysis by 
agriculture department 
the improved outlook for 1990 farm sales is strengthening 
income prospects the departments economic research service said 
wednesday gains in cash receipts are likely to outpace both 
expense increases and reductions in direct government payments 
production will probably increase slightly but strong demand 
continues to support most commodity prices at the farm level 
the report said 
however higher prices for feed grain producers also mean 
higher feed costs for livestock producers and stronger market 
prices translate into lower deficiency payments it added 
deficiency payments are direct subsidies due crop producers when 
market prices falter the payments help make up the difference 
between a target price level and the market prices 
department analysts have said total deficiency payments may drop 
to 9 billion or less this year from 11 billion in calendar 1989 
145 billion in 1988 and a peak of 167 billion in 1987 
overall net cash income of farmers is forecast at 55 billion 
to 59 billion this year up 1 billion from prospects a few months 
ago the report said that would compare with about 53 billion in 
1989 and the record of 572 billion in 1988 
as used by the agency net cash income measures the value of 
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments less 
outofpocket costs commodities sold actually may have been 
produced in earlier years and stored until harvested 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm 
income is now expected to be in the range of 47 billion to 51 
billion in 1990 up 2 billion from the earlier estimate but about 
the same as last years record 49 billion 
economists use net farm income to gauge the value of 
agricultural production in a year whether it is sold or stored 
plus government payments deductions are made for all costs 
including depreciation and other factors changes in the value of 
inventories held on the farm also are considered 
income gains and declines are not uniform in the agricultural 
sector any more than they are across the national economy 
while net cash income is forecast to grow at the national 
level it likely will decline 2 percent to 3 percent in the 
northeast remain unchanged in the south central region grow about 
6 percent to 8 percent in the southeast and west and rise 8 
percent to 9 percent in the midwest the report said 
farm asset values mostly land are projected to rise for the 
fourth straight year to between 870 billion and 880 billion by 
the end of this year that does not include the value of household 
assets 
the peak in farm assets was 9967 billion in 1981 before the 
sharp declines in land values and other financial troubles shoved 
the asset level down to 6895 billion in 1986

the us patent office told steve wingard of 
columbia sc that he is now the holder of patent number 
4912914 for his invention of a new forage harvester 
wingard who operates a hay farm says his apparatus can cut 
cure and bale hay in a single pass over the field 
although there have been some shortcut methods in use over the 
years the classic method of hay making is to cut rake windrow 
and bale or stack hay crop this can take several days while 
waiting for they hay to dry a period when rain can damage or ruin 
the crop 
wingard says his onceover hay maker cuts hay by 
conventional means and then passes the cuttings through a system of 
hightemperature rollers which use heat and pressure to remove 
much of the crops moisture 
the hay then is baled with the entire process requiring less 
than a minute he told the associated press

in the world of highfinance politics 
us rep romano mazzoli has rolled the dice by refusing political 
action committee money 
without the incumbents usual financial edge the 10term 
democrat faces a tough battle in tuesdays primary his main 
challenger is louisville businessman jeff hutter who drew 39 
percent of the vote against mazzoli two years ago 
this is something that has been growing in me for some 
while mazzoli said in a recent interview ive always felt 
politics belongs to the people not to the large special interest 
groups 
mazzoli 57 decided in december to set an example by becoming 
one of only about two dozen members of congress who reject pac 
contributions pacs had contributed about half of the money for 
mazzolis past campaigns 
to offset his loss of pac money 200000 during his run in 
1988 mazzoli has mounted an aggressive fundraising campaign 
as of last friday he said he had raised 133370 from 2018 
individual contributors he had 850 individual donations at that 
stage in the 1988 campaign 
hutter has raised more money than mazzoli mainly because he has 
accepted 40000 from pacs he had raised 172550 through may 9 
mazzolis other opponent louisville alderman paul bather 
estimated he will raise 60000 about 5000 of that from pacs 
the republican primary pits al brown an employeerelations 
consultant seeking to become the first black republican in the 
house since the depression against tim hardy president of a 
lighting fixture company 
mazzoli said pacs contribute nearly threefourths of their money 
to candidates seeking reelection instead of leveling the 
playing field pacs have become a force to keep incumbents in 
office he said 
but hutter a former local tv reporter said pacs have a 
purpose as long as they are held in balance with individual 
donations 
he accused mazzoli of raising the campaignfinance issue to 
divert attention from his record and create an issue on which to 
run 
hutter has criticized mazzoli for voting to repeal the 
catastrophic health care act raise the salaries of members of 
congress and severely restrict abortions 
bather said campaign finance reform is an important issue but 
he doubted whether it should receive top billing among a myriad of 
other issues 
but mazzoli said his reelection bid offers a timely backdrop to 
the current debate in congress about changing the method of 
financing campaigns 
i feel good about what weve done he said wherever i go 
people pat me on the back and commend me for what ive done this 
could be a sort of patternsetter if im able to pull it off

as official washington gears up for next 
weeks superpower summit a question of mounting us interest is 
how mikhail gorbachev will use his free time between and after 
formal meetings with president bush 
whom will he see where will he go how will he get there 
its still not set in concrete william black the state 
departments assistant chief of protocol said wednesday 
the schedule is of particular importance to the secret service 
which is coordinating the 24hour security required by us law for 
a visiting head of state 
black said his office is working with the soviets day and night 
to try to settle details of the soviet presidents itinerary during 
his washington stay beginning next wednesday evening and ending 
june 3 gorbachev is scheduled then to go to minnesota for six 
hours then visit san francisco and return to moscow on june 4 
its been hard getting the soviet advance team in washington 
to fill in the many blanks in gorbachevs itinerary another state 
department official said the official discussed the matter on 
condition of anonymity 
phone calls to the soviet embassy press section wednesday were 
not returned officials there on tuesday said many details of 
gorbachevs crosscountry visit were unsettled and that it was 
unclear when his plans would be announced publicly 
the embassy did get out word about the new englishlanguage 
publication of gorbachevs book perestroika and sovietamerican 
relations an embassy announcement reprinted the books preface 
in which gorbachev expresses optimism about the future of 
superpower relations and ends with the timely salutation until 
the next meeting with america 
gorbachev is to have at least six hours of official meetings 
with bush at the white house on may 31 and june 1 followed by a 
trip with bush to camp david md on june 2 and a joint news 
conference june 3 
gorbachev is to fly to minneapolis after the news conference for 
meetings with political and business leaders 
he then goes to san francisco where hell meet over breakfast 
june 4 with former president ronald reagan and former secretary of 
state george p shultz after visiting stanford university and 
meeting with scholars from the hoover institution hell meet with 
business executives and state political figures before returning to 
moscow 
american security and protocol officials are used to planning 
far in advance the most minute details of a us presidential 
visit so theyve been a bit distressed at the soviets more 
relaxed approach to setting gorbachevs itinerary 
one example cited by the state department official was 
uncertainty over whether gorbachev wanted to join bush in the 
presidential helicopter for the day trip to camp david next 
saturday or whether he preferred to travel separately 
ive asked three times and i still dont know the official 
said they say were still working on that 
gorbachevs advance teams may be keeping an eye out for planned 
protests by groups opposed to moscows efforts to stifle 
independence bids by the baltic republics including lithuania 
which is the target of a soviet energy embargo 
americans of baltic extraction are planning protests in the san 
francisco area and possibly elsewhere 
we want gorbachev to see what hes doing is really wrong 
especially the blockade said joe sidas of the baltic alliance 
an umbrella group for various organizations of the nearly 5000 
estonians latvians and lithuanians in the san francisco bay area 
this will be gorbachevs third us visit and his second summit 
in washington 
black said he was resigned to coping with uncertainty over the 
soviet itinerary 
these things tend to have a life of their own they are 
subject to change right up to the 11th hour the 59th minute you 
do learn to live with it he said

government officials are taking heart from 
preliminary information that drugrelated deaths dropped by 17 
percent last year but theyre not ready to call off the war on 
drugs 
i wouldnt take all the troops home on the basis of data 
provided by medical examiners to the national institute on drug 
abuse said david tell deputy chief of staff to william bennett 
the national drug control policy coordinator 
notwithstanding the sharpness of the drop its a sharp drop 
from unprecedented high numbers tell said wednesday the 
numbers are still too big 
asked if the information means the government is winning the war 
on drugs tell said i wouldnt go that far 
the data released by bennetts office of national drug control 
policy comes from medical examiners in 25 cities that submitted 
reports for 1988 and 1989 the examiners made mentions of drugs 
whenever a body autopsied was found to have a drug or drugs in the 
system it did not necessarily mean the substances caused the death 
the medical examiners reported a total of 2147 mentions of 
drugs in the fourth quarter of 1989 a 35 percent drop from 3299 
in the third quarter 
for the year total mentions of drugs by medical examiners 
dropped 17 percent from 14555 in 1988 to 12106 in 1989 
according to the provisional information 
the information indicates that hardcore drug use seems to 
have peaked and may now be dropping tell said but added the 
numbers are still unacceptably high lets have another couple of 
quarters of information 
andrea kopstein of nida also cautioned that the data is still 
incomplete and that even if the numbers hold up when the reports 
are finished this is just one threemonth period of a year 
trends are not made on one data point 
in addition the statistics do not include los angeles because 
that city submitted its 1989 data late those figures could have a 
major impact on the overall picture as the metropolitan area was 
responsible for almost 21 percent of all medical examiner mentions 
of drugs nationwide in 1988 
cocaine mentions dropped 47 percent in the last quarter of 1989 
from 756 to 404 for the year the decline was 15 percent from 
3111 to 2649 
heroin mentions declined 36 percent in the fourth quarter from 
548 to 351 for the year the heroin decline was 14 percent from 
2292 to 1960 
new york is responsible for about onethird of the total drug 
mentions and dramatic declines there skewed the figures somewhat 
when new yorks data is not included mentions of all drugs by 
medical examiners dropped by 10 percent for the year cocaine 
mentions declined by 7 percent and heroin mentions decreased by 10 
percent 
the number of drug mentions by medical examiners in 1989 still 
remains higher than te 1987 level excluding los angeles and new 
york city which did not submit such information for 1987 the 
total for 1989 was 8219 compared with 9096 the previous year and 
8006 in 1987 
the information comes from reports of medical examiners in the 
metropolitan areas of atlanta baltimore boston buffalo ny 
chicago cleveland dallas denver detroit indianapolis kansas 
city miami minneapolis newark nj new orleans norfolk va 
oklahoma city philadelphia phoenix st louis san antonio 
texas san diego san francisco seattle wash and washington 
meanwhile an internal drug enforcement administration document 
indicates that the purity of cocaine sold nationwide dropped in the 
first four months of 1990 falling far from its peak purity in 1988 
the street purchases of grams reflected the most significant 
decline they dropped on average from 72 percent pure in 1988 to 55 
percent pure in the first four months of this year dea spokesman

former american university president richard 
e berendzen says the obscene telephone calls he made were 
inappropriate and grotesque and that he has recently apologized 
to his victim 
berendzen who pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of 
making obscene telephone calls will serve no jail time as long as 
he receives psychological treatment and remains on good behavior 
he spoke wednesday night in an interview on abctvs 
nightline program 
i would hang up the phone back a couple of months ago and sit 
there for a minute or two in my office wearing my washington 
business suit and think why on earth have i had this 
conversation he said in his televised interview it was a 
total incongruity in my life which i simply did not understand 
he would not elaborate on the contents of his telephone calls 
i dont want to get into the conversations but it was quite 
inappropriate and grotesque he said 
fairfax county general district court judge j conrad waters jr 
sentenced berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge he suspended 
all of the jail time provided the educator stays out of trouble 
for one year and continues treatment 
hours after berendzens court appearance johns hopkins 
university hospital released a fivepage statement that said the 
51yearold former president had been sexually abused as a 
youngster 
he was sexually and emotionally abused severely as a child 
said the statement which the hospital said was released by the 
authority of dr paul r mchugh chairman of the hospitals 
psychiatry department 
he did not place calls for prurient interests rather in a 
confused way he was seeking answers to unresolved issues relating 
to his own abuse the person who allegedly abused berendzen was 
identified only as an adult woman who was close to him a release 
issued by mchugh said 
in a statement read outside the court by his attorney gerard 
treanor berendzen said in no way do i offer this report as an 
excuse for my conduct rather it gives additional information 
fills out the story and provides a fuller context for my actions 
berendzen said he would continue treatment on an outpatient 
basis at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore as ordered by the 
court and would report to the court every 90 days 
susan allen the victim of berendzens telephone calls said she 
was satisfied with the court action 
as far as what the judge decided to do i cannot criticize the 
judge he did what he felt was just and fair allen said 
berendzen said that he sent a letter of apology to allen 
allen told abc that berendzen would talk about having child sex 
slaves and once boasted that he kept a 4yearold girl in a dog 
cage in his basement and fed her human waste 
berendzen was treated at the psychiatric ward of the hospital 
from april 10 through may 4 officials said he was evaluated by 
the johns hopkins sexual disorders clinic prior to admission 
mchugh said 
berendzen was interviewed after the administration of sodium 
amytal along with psychological testing mchugh said berendzens 
pain and confusion about his childhood surfaced when his father 
died in 1988 when he visited his childhood home mchugh said 
this concludes a chapter in my life of pain apprehension and 
sorrow berendzen said in a statement released by his attorney 
it has been a necessary step one i have taken after much 
contemplation and with deep regret for my actions 
berendzen said on television that for some time he was able to 
avoid his urges by throwing himself into his university work 
berendzen resigned april 8 as president of the washington dc 
university saying he was exhausted he was charged may 11 
the charges were the result of phone calls berendzen made march 
28 and 29 police said during the calls berendzen talked about 
explicit detailed gross and graphic sex with adults and 
children one of the victims said 
the universitys board of trustees said in a statement following 
berendzens resignation that the harvardeducated astronomer quit 
in the best interest of the university after allegations of 
improper behavior 
berendzen had been president of the university since 1980 
the trustees appointed dr milton greenberg as the interim 
president and started a nationwide search for a permanent 
replacement

the united states and its nato allies are 
relaxing the highalert status of some frontline troops in a major 
battlefield adjustment to the collapse of the warsaw pact 
the decision came as nato is struggling to adapt to the 
widespread changes in europe by emphasizing the alliances 
political strengths rather than highlighting its warfighting 
capabilities 
defense secretary dick cheney said wednesday that with the 
unraveling of the sovietled warsaw pact we can afford to change 
the current status of our forces 
cheney speaking with reporters after a twoday nato session 
said some nearterm reductions in readiness levels will be 
begun july 1 among nato forces 
these are drastic changes said gen klaus naumann security 
adviser to defense minister gerhard stoltenberg of west germany 
todays meeting signifies an important step toward a new 
security relationship in europe nato secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner said 
the changes can take place now that the allies appear to have up 
to at least a few months warning time of a fullscale soviet 
attack cheney told reporters aboard his plane 
its clear that given the developments in europe we have 
more advance notice of a soviet military attack on nato than we 
have been able to plan for for years cheney said 
the secretary added that the warning time could increase 
substantially if an arms accord limiting troops and nonnuclear 
weapons can be implemented and soviet troops leave eastern europe 
lengthened warning time of a soviet attack has important 
implications for us military planners since most of americas 
defense budget is directed to fighting in natos defense 
cheney had attended a nato session in brussels belgium where 
the pacts defense ministers ordered a hard look at the alliances 
military strategy now that democratic governments have replaced 
hardline communist regimes in eastern europe 
the ministers also challenged moscow to stop footdragging in 
the conventional arms talks so an accord can be wrapped up this 
year 
moscow and washington have settled on a plan to trim their 
forces to 195000 for each side in central europe with the united 
states retaining an additional 30000 in britain and southern 
europe the united states currently has 305000 troops in europe 
while the soviets have an estimated 565000 
still unresolved are reductions in combat aircraft and measures 
to ensure compliance with an eventual accord 
the brussels meeting was one of several nato meetings held in 
preparation for the july summit of alliance leaders called by 
president bush 
the soviets are balking at the prospect of a united germany 
joining nato and the western alliance is fighting calls from some 
europeans that it and the warsaw pact be disbanded and replaced by 
an umbrella security organization focused on human rights issues 
in their final communique the ministers said they intended to 
reap the benefits of the improved climate in eastwest 
relations and decided to take steps to lower the readiness and 
availability of a number of our standing forces 
cheney said the change involved adjustments of hours and 
days in which troops are called upon to be ready for battle 
within a 24hour period for example nearly a halfdozen crews 
take turns standing watch so a jet fighter squadron or troop 
transport helicopter unit could take flight within minutes in the 
event of an attack 
such roundtheclock alerts are costly in both financial and 
human terms and adjustments offer some relief as military budgets 
are cut and the ranks of us soldiers stationed in europe are 
expected to be thinned under a troop cutting accord 
a helicopter unit that is supposed to be ready to go 
within four hours of the gun going off now would have 48 hours 
explained stephen hadley the assistant secretary of defense for 
international policy who accompanied cheney to brussels 
cheney called the initial change a modest one noting that 
the adjustments ordered were those that natos top commander us 
gen john galvin could make on his own authority 
but the secretary said galvin was ordered to consider additional 
changes which might require the ministers approval

a congressional commission wants a new 
independent agency to administer most immigration and refugee 
policies 
under the proposal most of the service functions now performed 
by the immigration and naturalization service and the state 
department would be consolidated in a new agency border security 
and interdiction efforts would be kept separate 
a draft report by the commission proposes creation of a new 
agency for migration affairs to coordinate immigration policy and 
services 
immigration policy is far too important to be relegated to a 
stepchild agency such as the immigration and naturalization 
service which falls uncomfortably within the department of justice 
and which historically has been beset with serious management and 
resource problems said the commission for the study of 
international migration and cooperative economic development 
nor should these functions be diluted among three different 
bureaus in the state department where they too often are 
subordinated to shortterm department considerations and compete 
for resources and attention the report added 
rep bruce morrison chairman of the house immigration 
subcommittee said he favored consolidating many immigration 
functions but opposed creating a new federal agency 
morrison dconn said he also favored separating alien 
interdiction efforts from the service functions performed by ins 
and the state department 
the report said an independent agency was needed because no 
mechanism exists within the us government to weigh the impact of 
migration to rank it against other priorities or to bring it to 
the attention of decision makers 
citizenship immigration and refugee policy would be 
administered by the new agency under the proposal first reported 
in wednesdays editions of the washington post 
the border patrol would remain a part of the justice department 
the coast guard and the us customs service would continue to play 
separate roles in turning back illegal aliens 
the 12member commission was created by the 1986 immigration 
reform law to identify the factors that encourage migration to the 
united states 
the draft study said increased economic aid and trade 
concessions to impoverished nations was needed to discourage 
migration to this country 
the issue for many countries is stark they either export 
goods and services to create jobs at home or they export people 
the report said

a committee of experts wants the government to 
know a lot more about the personal finances of workers with access 
to top secrets because money has become the root of modern spying 
the experts appeal for 13 new laws was warmly received by the 
senate intelligence committee whose chairman david boren 
dokla and vice chairman william cohen rmaine set them to 
work nine months ago 
nevertheless as the experts presented their report wednesday 
democratic and republican senators indicated they might revise the 
proposals to introduce additional protections for civil liberties 
many of the proposals would allow government investigators to 
intrude much more deeply into the personal finances of the 700000 
government and weapons industry employees who hold top secret 
clearances 
to get those jobs they would have to agree to allow 
investigators to examine their bank and commercial credit records 
anytime up to five years after they leave the secret work 
they would be required to report any foreign travel and any 
contacts with citizens of foreign countries 
the 25000 to 30000 employees who work with codes and code 
machines would be subject to random polygraph tests but the 
questions would be limited to whether they spied or sold secrets 
and would not cover as sen boren put it how many cocktails 
they drank or xrated movies they saw 
sen cohen asked whether the lawmakers ought to write in 
assurances that a polygraph test alone could not result in firing 
the informal chairman of the experts eli jacobs a venture 
capitalist and government defense policy adviser assured him the 
experts agreed that the polygraph should not be the sole 
indicator of suitability 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio asked how many investigators 
would have access to travel records and whether they could be 
prevented from misusing information about a trip for an abortion or 
for an extramarital affair 
columbia university law professor harold edgar told him only 
1000 investigators would see such information retired navy adm 
bobby ray inman a former deputy cia director said congress could 
require that information unrelated to spying be destroyed 
the experts also recommended making it a crime to possess spy 
tools like burst transmitters and secret writing devices with 
intent to commit espionage 
and they proposed making it a crime just to sell a document 
stamped top secret the government would no longer have to disclose 
the contents in court or prove the material deserved the top secret 
stamp 
we hope this legislation would raise the risk that individuals 
would run by engaging in espionage first that they would be 
caught and second that they would end up paying a penalty 
serving time in jail said inman said 
inman told the senators that the ninemember panel had looked 
for patterns in the spy cases of recent years in the 1960s there 
was an overwhelmingly shift from recruitment of spies through 
ideology to volunteer spies usually seeking money he said 
he presented an analysis of 19 wellknown cases in the last 20 
years money was a motive in 14 
sen boren praised the experts for pointing out a blind spot 
in us defenses once workers obtain security clearances we 
know less about them financially than if theyre applying for an 
auto loan boren said 
the experts and the senators emphasized that the recent changes 
in communist countries would merely shift the focus of spies from 
military to economic secrets 
but under questioning from sen john danforth rmo prof 
edgar acknowledged that the proposals do not specifically treat 
economic espionage aimed at private corporate secrets unless they 
also are government defense secrets 
the panel also proposed 
giving the fbi power to obtain credit records in secret with a 
letter certifying that the subject was suspected of spying and 
allowing the fbi to obtain secretly the names of unlistedtelephone 
owners who call spy suspects 
the bush administration is seeking these two changes but they 
have been rejected before 
barring spies from profiting from books about their crimes 
stripping retirement pay from us workers convicted of spying 
abroad 
establishing a 1 million reward for turning in a spy 
requiring the fbi to obtain a secret warrant before 
burglarizing a suspected spy such warrants are required to plant 
listening device the burglaries socalled black bag jobs are 
done under inherent presidential powers 
allowing the national security agency the nations code 
agency to counsel troubled former employees 
the other experts are former cia director richard helms former 
deputy attorney general and deputy secretary of state warren 
christopher former carter white house counsel lloyd cutler former 
reagan white house counsel arthur b culvahouse jr former 
ambassador to the organization of american states sol linowitz and

as the savings and loan crisis deepens a key 
congressional committee plans to intensify its investigation of one 
of the costliest thrift failures by looking into government 
regulators role in the debacle 
the house banking committee finished two days of hearings 
wednesday on the 1 billion collapse of silverado banking savings 
and loan association of denver 
several witnesses including president bushs son neil a 
former director of silverado appeared at the request of the 
committee 
but 10 other people who failed to show up were subpoenaed by the 
panel and are expected to appear at future hearings they include 
former federal regulators as well as former executives of silverado 
and businessmen who borrowed heavily from the thrift 
the committee has serious concerns about the role played by 
regulators particularly at the topeka kan offices of the 
federal home loan bank and the office of thrift supervision who 
were responsible for overseeing silverado 
we must marvel at the seeming inability of the thrift 
regulators to use preventive medicine rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas told the hearing on tuesday 
if the regulators didnt like a particular brand of explosive 
the silverado management would happily go back to the storeroom and 
use another equally dangerous mixture gonzalez said in the 
end they were going to blow the institution skyhigh 
among the noshows subpoenaed by the committee are kermit 
mowbray former president of the federal home loan bank in topeka 
and tommie d thompson former district director of the ots in that 
city 
and if some democrats on the committee have their way the 
investigation would be widened to include the justice department 
and attorney general dick thornburgh would be called to testify 
no savings and loan investigation by this committee will be 
complete until the attorney general appears as a witness rep 
frank annunzio dill said wednesday 
we must find out why the justice department is so reluctant to 
investigate savings and loan cases the taxpayers have a 
halftrillion reasons to want an answer to the question when are 
the savings and loan crooks going to jail 
the bush administration dramatically boosted its estimate 
wednesday for rescuing the thrift industry blaming a slumping real 
estate market for putting a far higher number of sampls at risk it 
said more than 1000 additional thrifts could fail and the 
government will need to borrow between 90 billion and 130 billion 
to clean up the mess 
neil bush told the banking committee that his business 
relationships didnt conflict with his role as a director of 
silverado he said allegations of conflict of interest from federal 
regulators are frivolous 
the fact they are being pursued is baffling to me said 
bush 34 an oil and gas developer 
bush said his business relationships with two of silverados 
major borrowers developers kenneth good and bill walters dont 
create a conflict in fact or in law regulators have alleged that 
loans by silverado to the two were a conflict of interest for bush 
who had oil and gas business deals with the men but failed to 
disclose that relationship to silverados board 
bush said walters was a passive limited partner in jnb 
exploration bushs company but had no involvement in operations 
of the enterprise walters put 150000 into jnb 
bush said his own investment was 100 and sweat i was out 
there working every day i generated the deals 
a federal regulator told the committee tuesday that bush a 
focal point of the inquiry into the silverado failure approved 
106 million in loans to walters who defaulted on the entire 
amount

a scorecard for the nations nursing homes 
shows fewer quality problems overall than the previous survey 
found but federal health officials say more improvement is needed 
inspections in 198889 found nearly a quarter of the 15000 
nursing homes with medicaid and medicare patients did not 
administer drugs properly and more than a third did not meet 
standards for food storage and preparation 
among the 10000 homes that provide skilled nursing care more 
than a quarter did not assure good personal hygiene for residents 
and that was a problem for 18 percent of the 5000 intermediate 
care facilities 
we are doing much better on some areas than we are doing on 
others said gail wilensky head of the health care financing 
administration 
but she added wednesday i would be much happier as a public 
official if those numbers were a lot lower and well continue to 
work to get them just as low as we can 
the information is in a 93volume guide at least one volume 
per state put out by wilenskys agency to help consumers select 
nursing homes 
it provides basic information that consumers should use to ask 
questions of nursing home operators she said but stressed that 
this is not the definitive guide to nursing home selection 
it indicates that if you are looking at a particular nursing 
home in your state and problems existed at the time they were 
inspected you ought to go in and say what have you done to 
correct the deficiencies she said 
the reports are based on the most recent unannounced inspection 
of the nursing homes in cases where quality standards were not 
met homes were told to correct the deficiencies she said 
inspectors then must return to the home to see whether the 
corrections are adequate and if they are not action may be taken 
against the home by the state or federal government 
the massive report the second in a planned annual series 
grades the performance of the nursing homes on 32 of the 500 or so 
categories judged during onsite inspections at least once a year 
the categories include such things as cleanliness medical 
supervision nursing care availability of emergency services food 
quality and attention to personal needs 
as was the case last year when the first report was issued many 
in the nursing home industry called the documents incomplete and 
misleading 
paul willging of the american health care association which 
represents 10000 nursing homes with 1 million residents said the 
guide is not reliable in fact the guide could be harmful to 
consumers who use it as a shortcut to selecting a nursing home 
the national council on the aging said the reports rely on the 
personal judgments made by 3000 state inspectors whose opinions 
can vary greatly and the american association of homes for the 
aging said the report does not indicate the seriousness of the 
violations 
two nursing homes can look very similar on paper yet actually 
be quite different in their quality of care said sheldon 
goldberg association president 
but horace deets executive director of the american association 
of retired persons said the reports were a reliable source that 
will help people to make a more informed decision in the selection 
of a nursing home 
the national council of senior citizens and the national 
citizens coalition for nursing home reform said they were 
disturbed by the extent of the problems at nursing homes and called 
for stronger enforcement efforts 
the most common deficiency was in sanitary food conditions 36 
percent of the skilledcare homes did not meet this standard 
compared with 43 percent in the report for 198788 
the next most common deficiency among skilledcare facilities 
was in ensuring good personal hygiene of residents a category 
which 26 percent failed previously 30 percent did not meet this 
standard 
also nearly 25 percent of skilledcare facilities were not 
administering drugs properly down from 29 percent in 198788 
the failure rate for intermediatecare homes followed a similar 
pattern as the skilledcare facilities

a national institutes of health committee says 
more research is needed before injections of immunoglobulin blood 
cells are used generally to treat babies with aids 
the committee made the recommendation wednesday after studying 
the uses of an treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin therapy 
or ivig which is becoming widely used for a variety of illnesses 
related to the immune system 
dr peter e lipsky the committee chairman and a professor at 
the university of texas southwestern medical center said that 
although ivig has been reported in one limited study as useful in 
treating newborns with aids there have been no clinical trials to 
prove its value 
the treatment is unpleasant said lipsky if it doesnt 
afford much benefit it doesnt make sense to subject them to this 
expensive treatment 
clinical trials are now underway the committee said to 
determine whether the ivig therapy can help babies born with aids 
to develop natural defenses against disease

the rev j lee simmons isnt sure his 
operation rescue followers are willing to ante up in their fight to 
stop abortion since the us supreme court raised the stakes 
the high court monday upheld a ban on operation rescue 
demonstrations aimed at preventing women from entering new york 
cityarea abortion clinics a week earlier the court left intact a 
ban on operation rescue blockades in atlanta 
theres a small handful determined to carry on no matter 
what said simmons head of operation rescue in central new york 
but for the average guy in an office or the homemaker with 
children the price is getting too high to pay i own a house i 
have four children and a ministry i cant afford big fines and 
long jail sentences not many people can 
the rulings may force operation rescue to change its tactics but 
are not expected to have a significant bearing on the abortion 
debate some observers say 
its not an abortion case its a first amendment case and 
frankly one without any fireworks said steve shiffrin a 
cornell university law professor the first amendment protects 
expression of ideas it doesnt allow people to block entrance into 
a building as a way of expressing those ideas 
many abortion foes including the national right to life 
committee have long disapproved of operation rescues combative 
tactics concentrating instead on lobbying lawmakers 
the new york state catholic conference also focuses on 
legislative action rather than picketing clinics 
we rescue unborn children in a different way said kathy 
gallagher associate director of the new york state catholic 
conference we also want to raise the level of debate to a deeper 
level and change social attitudes 
supporters of legalized abortion predicted the rulings will spur 
a proliferation of injunction requests by clinics targeted by 
operation rescue 
weve been telling clinics for a long time the way to go is to 
get an injunction but we couldnt get clinics to move said 
molly yard president of the national organization for women which 
brought the new york case against operation rescue 
she said the threat of 500aday fines for violating an 
injunction would discourage demonstrators 
your troops disappear pretty quickly when they know thats 
what they are up against its very clear that eventually its 
going to be too expensive for them yard said 
simmons who is associated with a nondenominational christian 
congregation agreed fines have been discouraging 
some of these courts are imposing fines as high as 10000 per 
individual how many people are willing to protest at that cost 
he asked weve already noticed the numbers going down as the 
judgments go up 
simmons who is challenging a 45day jail sentence for violating 
a court order not to trespass at a local clinic said operation 
rescues syracuse chapter will change its tactics already it has 
taken to picketing the homes of doctors who perform abortions 
clinic blockades are not the only means of protest its just 
one tactic it was effective for a particular time but no more 
said simmons 
operation rescue had to close its national headquarters in 
binghamton this year selling off its furniture and office 
equipment to help pay off 70000 in debts brought on by its legal 
difficulties 
but randall terry founder of operation rescue has vowed that 
his 3yearold organization will continue to rescue babies 
despite any court injunctions 
he said there have been 12 to 15 rescues in the new york 
city area since the injunction every time they rescue they know 
theyre facing a 25000 fine and they do it anyway terry said

soldiers are building 
a 20foot fence around their outpost in this refugee camp a 
reflection of the armys nervousness ever since palestinians 
exploded with anger over the slayings of seven arab workers by a 
lone israeli 
in rioting since the slayings sunday at least 13 palestinians 
have been fatally shot prompting an appeal from president bush for 
maximum restraint 
army commanders insist that soldiers kept their cool and 
prevented far worse bloodshed but critics say the military could 
have prevented many casualties both by being less eager to 
confront rioters and by using nonlethal methods of riot control 
instead of live ammunition 
here in jabaliya soldiers said no one was killed in the 
outburst following the slayings which israel says were committted 
by a disturbed former soldier 
arab hospital officials said however that on sunday alone 33 
residents of the camp of 53000 wwere treated for gunshot wounds 
col meron the officer in charge of the northern sector of 
gaza said that bringing in extra troops kept the soldiers from 
being overwhelmed and prevented bloodshed 
we brought in many units to put the situation under control 
we had to put it under curfew and keep the people indoors to 
prevent killing and to prevent wounding meron said the 
difficult thing is to remain cool 
but giorgio giocomelli commissionergeneral of the un relief 
and works agency which administers schools and food aid in the 
camps deplored what he called an excessive use of force by 
soldiers 
he said that although standing orders are to shoot only at the 
legs of rioters 60 percent of the 842 wounded in the first two 
days of clashes were hit in the upper body 
we are disturbed that the use of live rounds of ammunition 
should have been resorted to so quickly and extensively and that 
the type of wounds inflicted appear to indicate a disregard for 
human life he said 
army commanders say demonstrations do not disperse by themselves 
if left alone but rather can grow more violent therefore orders 
are to disperse youths before they can gather into a mob 
the army is not sitting idly by and hoping that the situation 
blows over by itself an army spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
lt gen dan shomron the chief of staff said after the recent 
rioting erupted that the army would not allow palestinians to take 
control of the streets as they did in the early days of the 
uprising 
i want to warn the public at large in the territoriesthat 
we will in no way allow them to take to the streets he said on 
israel television 
avraham burg a liberal member of parliament said the problem 
lies not with the soldiers but with prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing government which has failed to satisfy palestinian 
political aspirations 
the answer is very simple shamir is responsible for the peace 
process stalling burg said and the minute you stop the peace 
dynamic the war dynamic takes its place 
in jabaliya where the antiisraeli uprising began 29 months 
ago black flags of mourning for the massacred laborers still hung 
from most shanties wednesday a military curfew was still in force 
confining residents to their homes 
palestinian women exempted from the curfew to visit medical 
clinics shouted at the soldiers as they passed and children 
whistled in protest 
but the soldiers said they do not respond to such provocations 
its not the first time we are here in the gaza strip we know 
more of their tricks now said dov a sergeant we dont try to 
make any contact with them if they are whistling we just let them 
whistle

freight trains were detoured and amtrak 
passengers were put on buses as floodwaters from the trinity river 
surged over liberty the last city before the gulf of mexico 
southern pacific railway workers dumped carloads of ballast to 
bolster the pilings on its sunset route trestle across the trinity 
just outside liberty the trestle is part of amtraks main route 
between new orleans and los angeles 
this is a very difficult situation we sustained hurricanes 
earthquakes on the west coast and tornadoes in the midwest said 
southern pacific spokesman jim johnson its a battle were all 
in against now of how long can we sustain 
elsewhere louisiana and oklahoma officials said flooding there 
caused more than 20 million damage to farms officials in arkansas 
assured travelers that holiday weekend visits to state parks 
shouldnt be canceled for fear of flood damage 
in texas torrential rains some three weeks ago 200 miles to the 
north caused the trinity on wednesday to rise to a record depth of 
nearly 30 feet in liberty officials said the old record of 29 
feet was set in 1942 
liberty population 8500 is about 16 miles from the trinity 
bay which feeds into galveston bay and eventually the gulf of 
mexico 
volunteers in liberty county shored up levees to keep 
floodwaters from swamping the expensive travis park subdivision and 
other parts of the city 
but the end appeared in sight 
if i had to pick a cutoff day a day when this would start 
turning around it would be today jim mitchum liberty county 
emergency management coordinator said wednesday i think were 
getting the worst of it now 
as southern pacific workers maintained a 24hour vigil to save 
the trestle across the river the company detoured its freight 
trains and amtrak bused passengers between houston and new orleans 
to avoid the flood johnson said 
graham nance of the federal emergency management agency said 
about 1 million in federal money has been distributed to flood 
victims fortyone texas counties have been declared eligible for 
federal disaster assistance 
in central louisiana officials estimated flooding has caused 
more than 10 million damage to farms farm bureau president ronnie 
anderson said more than 100000 acres of cropland have been flooded 
and more are expected to go under 
theres no doubt that this can be considered a disaster and 
were going to ask congress as well as secretary of agriculture 
clayton yeutter to declare it so he said 
preliminary reports from oklahoma farmers show at least 8 
million in damage to buildings and about 25 million to machinery 
and equipment an agriculture official said bart brorsen 
executive director of the state agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service said other losses include more than 2800 
cattle and 30000 poultry 
arkansas tourism officials minimized reports of flood damage 
i think a lot of people are taking it that the whole state is 
under water said richard davies interim state parks and tourism 
department chief 
flash flooding occurred saturday night in hot springs one of 
the states top tourist areas but the water was gone 24 hours 
later much of the flooding earlier along the arkansas and red 
rivers involved farmland 
usually the memorial day weekend draws 250000 people to 
arkansas and they spend an estimated 345 million davies said

abc news has the poorest record among 
the three major networks in promoting women reporters visibility 
a study indicates 
the survey of 186 reporters who filed at least five stories in 
1989 for abc cbs or nbc also found that only eight women were 
among the top 100 highprofile correspondents in 1989 compared 
with 15 in 1988 
there is an assumption in american society that women are 
upwardly mobile in the workplace but thats not the case in 
network television news said joe s foote chairman of the 
radiotv department at southern illinois university 
the reporters were ranked by the number of stories they had on 
the air during 1989 
only three women ranked in the top 10 excluding news anchors 
cbss lesley stahl at no 3 nbcs andrea mitchell at no 4 and 
cbss rita braver at no 8 
there were more women at the top than ever before thats 
unprecedented foote said wednesday but there were 50 percent 
fewer women overall 
there were no abc women in the top 50 the highestrated woman 
correspondent for abc was sheilah kast at no 65 and the next was 
bettina gregory at 96 abc grossly underused its women 
correspondents foote said 
abc spokesman scott richardson declined to comment on the study 
until he had reviewed it but he questioned the validity of the 
survey noting that the network was the only one with three 
primetime female news anchors 
it doesnt really give much of the big picture he said 
ranked no 1 in visibility was john cochran of nbc followed by 
brit hume of abc stahl who covers the white house reached the 
highest rank ever for a woman in footes sevenyear study 
its a function of the beat stahl said the white house 
beat gets a lot of play 
while stahl was pleased that she had ranked so high she said 
she was disturbed by the small number of women in the top 100 we 
could always do better she said we still dont have women in 
management either 
kast who covers congress said women reporters have been 
frustrated with battling abc to increase their numbers and move 
them into highprofile beats 
i would be surprised if there is a conscious bias what might 
be more likely is that news executives are not in the habit of 
seeing women in the positions of getting on the air she said 
the study also found no blacks among the top 50 correspondents 
and only two hispanic correspondents cbss juan vasquez at no 16 
and abcs john quinones at no 41 
information for the study was gleaned from the vanderbilt 
university television news index in nashville tenn and 
abstracts foote said

shoppers worried about higher prices but some 
said they were ready to shell out more rubles to get better 
products 
if only we could get some decent stuff i am ready to pay 
more said vladimir yashin a metalworker as he waited to buy a 
275 bottle of wine anything is better so that i dont have to 
stand in line for this trash 
customers had mixed reactions after government officials 
proposed a nationwide referendum on whether to switch from a 
centrally planned to a regulated market economy feelings ranged 
from support to anger to apathy 
some expressed concern over how the reforms to be voted on will 
affect their standard of living which already lags behind that of 
many industrialized countries 
many acknowledged they had little understanding of the proposed 
reforms or the workings of a market economy most government 
pronouncements have stressed that people will be compensated for 
the higher prices they have not detailed how much costs will rise 
or why 
under the economic proposal the first shock would come july 1 
when the price of bread would double president mikhail s 
gorbachev has said bread is now so artificially cheap that children 
use loaves as footballs other prices would rise jan 1 
customers gave little sign of the panic buying that was 
predicted by one senior economist after the proposed referendum was 
announced 
several shoppers said the hoarding of flour sugar and other 
goods has been going on for some time 
apathy was evident in stores wednesday afternoon 
why should i care about the reforms im getting ready to kick 
the bucket said raisa okolkova a 58yearold cleaning woman 
sweeping the cracked white and gray floor tiles of a dingy grocery 
store 
the reform will crush me she added apparently unaware of 
the plan to compensate lowincome families 
another shopper in grocery no 44 said that if prices rise she 
will starve on her 130 monthly pension 
now i can afford to buy meat if i can get it for 2 rubles 
320 a kilo 22 pounds and if it soars to six to eight 
rubles ill have to put my teeth away on a shelf said the 
65yearold woman who refused to give her name 
the store seemed to stock only coffee biscuits honey juice 
pickled vegetables and bruised green cuban oranges 
only two of a dozen banks of flourescent lights were on the 
rest were either broken or off to conserve electricity 
reformers say the prices of many items are below production 
costs a problem that discourages increased production or quality 
economists have been warning that soviets will have to suffer 
with shortages hoarding higher prices and some unemployment for a 
few years before the economy gets in shape

gallons a day for aruba until january as long as there is a surplus 
of water in the river 
the river is spilling over so its fine it doesnt do any

a military judge ruled the former skipper of 
the destroyer uss kinkaid was not criminally liable for a collision 
with a merchant vessel that killed one crewman and injured five 
others 
after an eightday courtmartial the judge capt richard reed 
on wednesday acquitted cmdr john cochrane of negligence and 
dereliction of duty in the nov 12 accident off the malay peninsula 
cochrane had faced up to two years confinement and dismissal 
from the navy 
the 44yearold officer who had been stripped of his command 
one week after the accident smiled and embraced his attorneys 
then his wife suzanne 
im not bitter towards the navy i love the united states 
navy he said in the end i was exonerated and it proves the 
military justice system works 
the judge noted that a navy skippers duty to see to the safe 
navigation of his ship and wellbeing of his crew differs from 
criminal liability which demands proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
prosecutor lt cmdr leroy dickens left immediately after the 
verdict without commenting 
but cmdr danny barrett the chief navy prosecutor in san diego 
said i dont think this changes anything a commanding officer 
is accountable for his ship and always will be 
the san diegobased kinkaid and the panamanian merchant ship 
kota petani collided in the dark when the destroyer was on the 
wrong side of the heavily traveled strait of malacca 240 miles 
southwest of singapore 
dickens had argued that cochranes weak management style and 
failure to follow procedure led to the accident 
but defense attorney cmdr bayne smith said cochrane should not 
be held criminally liable for the failings of subordinates 
smith argued that the kinkaids 24yearold navigator lt sean 
mcphee miscalculated the ships expected arrival time in the 
strait mcphee died in the collision

under pressure from a judge to overhaul 
texas school finances the legislature may be on the verge of 
doing something it hasnt done in 11 years override a 
gubernatorial veto 
the texas senate voted 238 along party lines wednesday night to 
override gov bill clements veto of a 555 million school finance 
reform plan 
house speaker gib lewis predicted his chamber would follow suit 
if twothirds of the 150member house vote to override clements 
veto the reform plan becomes law over the governors objections 
no texas governors veto has been rebuffed since 1979 when the 
legislature overrode clements rejection of a minor bill on hunting 
and fishing regulations 
lewis didnt say how soon the house would attempt an override 
but the current special session lawmakers third on school 
finance ends may 31 
the legislature had previously passed the bill to meet a 
unanimous texas supreme court order to make more money available to 
poor school districts but the governor vetoed it over plans for a 
halfcent increase in the 6cent sales tax 
the state faces a june 1 court deadline for action if the 
democratcontrolled legislature and the gop governor dont adopt a 
plan by then a courtappointed master will write one for them 
state district judge scott mccown ruled earlier this month 
in urging the override democrat carl parker said the bill 
wasnt perfect but was a compromise that would end a nearly 
threemonth stalemate between the legislature and the governor 
were looking silly before the nation for not making 
provisions for future generations he said 
clements condemned the senate vote saying the bill would cause 
property taxes to skyrocket this is totally unacceptable 
especially when alternatives clearly exist he said 
the overhaul was made necessary when the texas supreme court 
declared the current finance system unconstitutional because of 
wide disparities in spending between rich and poor districts 
as in most states school spending in texas is based primarily 
on property taxes 
courts in a dozen states have overturned school finance systems 
in recent years the others are kentucky new jersey kansas 
wisconsin california connecticut washington west virginia 
wyoming arkansas and montana

only a narrow range of white blood cells may be 
involved in triggering multiple sclerosis scientists said today in 
a finding hailed as a major step in understanding the crippling 
nerve disease 
researchers found surprisingly few types of those cells when 
they analyzed diseased brain tissue from multiple sclerosis 
patients said study coauthor dr lawrence steinman of stanford 
university 
the disease results when the bodys diseasefighting immune 
system mistakenly attacks nerve tissue in the brain and central 
nervous system research suggests that white blood cells called 
tcells play a critical role in the onslaught 
the new findings imply that the disease may be treatable with 
strategies that block just the types of tcells cells involved in 
that attack steinman said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the work is a major step toward better understanding of the 
disease said stephen reingold vice president for research and 
medical programs of the national multiple sclerosis society 
it would be very attractive indeed to be able to block just 
diseasecausing blood cells rather than risking side effects from 
experimental drugs that more broadly affect the immune system he 
said 
but reingold stressed that the new study included only three 
patients so that its importance for multiple sclerosis in general 
is not clear and he said it left other key questions unanswered 
he also said any implication for therapy would be far in the 
future 
the study is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by researchers at stanford latrobe university in australia 
and cetus corp in emeryville calif 
an estimated 250000 americans have ms an often disabling 
condition that can produce weakness difficulty in coordination 
dizziness and loss of balance 
the studys authors focused on structures called receptors that 
are found on the surface of tcells the cells use receptors to 
bind to their targets and the targets they can attack are 
determined by the types of receptor they carry 
using one criterion for describing receptors researchers 
analyzed types of tcell receptors in diseased brain tissue from 
three ms patients they found two to four receptor types in each 
brain 
in contrast there may be 20 to 30 such receptor types used by 
tcells in the body with the exact number not known commented dr 
henry mcfarland of the national institute of neurological disorders 
and stroke 
in the new study one receptor type showed up in all three 
patients tcells bearing that type are not very common in blood 
at least in people without multiple sclerosis steinman said 
the restricted number of receptor types found in the brain 
suggests the tcells are targeting something very very specific 
in the brain steinman said in a telephone interview the target 
is not known he said 
researchers might be able to develop a therapy that blocks 
tcells carrying the receptors implicated in the disease he said 
such a strategy successfully treated mice with a disease 
resembling multiple sclerosis the nature paper noted researchers 
used proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bound to particular 
types of tcells 
the new study left some questions unanswered experts said 
reingold said it is not clear whether similar tcell findings would 
appear in brains of people with similar diseases which would mean 
the findings are not specific to multiple sclerosis steinman said 
researchers are checking on that 
dr stephen hauser of harvard medical school and massachusetts 
general hospital in boston cautioned that treatment the patients 
received before the study may have destroyed other types of tcells 
that also participate in the disease steinman said if that is so 
the fact the observed tcells survived may mean theyre the ones 
we really have to focus on for therapy

africas misery is deepening even as living 
conditions slowly improve in much of the third world according to 
a study released today 
the report by the un development program said africans lead 
shorter lives and have the worst infant mortality and literacy 
rates of all developing regions 
in any concerted international effort to improve human 
development in the third world priority must go to africa said 
mahbub ul haq principal author of the report 
the study rated personal wellbeing in 130 countries based on a 
formula combining life expectancy adult literacy and percapita 
income of the 44 countries the study listed as having low human 
development 33 are in africa 
the african nation with the highest rating was mauritius ranked 
no 49 
the continents percapita income fell by a quarter in the 
1980s and more than half of all africans now live in poverty 
according to the report 
africans account for a quarter of the worlds extremely poor 
while representing less than 10 percent of the population the 
study found the study predicted nearly 400 million people there 
will be living in extreme poverty by 1995 up from 250 million in 
1985 
life expectancy at birth in subsaharan africa is only 51 years 
compared with 62 for all developing nations and 74 for 
industrialized countries the report said 
only 45 percent of africans have access to health services and 
only 37 percent have access to safe drinking water 
the report notes significant progress in the developing world 
during the 30year period ending in 1987 life expectancy rose from 
46 years in 1960 to 62 in 1987 the under5 mortality rate was 
halved and primary health care was extended to 62 percent of the 
population 
aricas 31 percent population growth rate exceeds the 2 percent 
average for all developing countries but the net amount of aid 
from richer countries has declined largely because of africas 
debt payments the report said

they cheered when the fat barkeep jock 
was shot they booed when drugdealing leo threatened to torch his 
wife and they said goodbye when eyepatched nadine 
threatened suicide 
more than 100 fans of the broodingly comic abc series twin 
peaks gathered wednesday night in the salish lodge the 
reallife counterpart of the shows great northern lodge to watch 
the seasonending episode 
much of the series was shot in this small pacific northwest 
logging town about 30 miles east of seattle 
the audience sat glued to the three glowing screens in the 
basement ballroom of the salish gorging as lustily on cherry pie 
doughnuts and coffee as any of the twin peaks townies 
its great its twisted like me and all my friends said 
annie raye who came dressed as the character nadine down to the 
makeshift patch over her left eye 
nadine knows a lot shes not telling ms raye said 
referring to the unsolved murder of the character laura palmer in 
the show nadine has spent time alone with the log 
the log for those uninitiated in the hourlong series that will 
return in the fall is usually carried by the log lady a 
psychic who talks with it for insight 
locals say twin peaks with its duelingchainsaw loggers 
satanic cults and macabre death plots has little to do with the 
real snoqualmie but theyre addicted anyway 
garnet cross who bakes pies for the cafe immortalized by the 
show the mart in nearby north bend was given a front row seat 
at wednesdays gathering 
ms cross who has baked pies for 50 years said the demand for 
her authentic cherry pies has exploded since fbi agent dale cooper 
first smacked his lips over the double r diners cherry pie in the 
twin peaks pilot 
she said people include the mart on trips to washington now 
and shes had requests to mail pies out of state this is the 
best thing thats happened to me she said 
mart owner pat cokewell said we used to sell about one a 
week now we sell as many as she makes 
the ballroom gathering was organized by radio station klsy 
which has started calling itself the official twin peaks 
station 
announcer tim hunter said he got hooked after watching the first 
episode he said he received more than 200 calls when he asked if 
listeners wanted the station to recap the show each week 
that led to a radio contest and winners got to come to the 
seasonfinale party in real twin peaks territory 
at least one local wasnt happy with the show louis delicino 
looked harried in his salish lodge tuxedo shirt and bow tie as he 
rushed from table to table delivering plates of cherry pie 
pausing with three plates balanced on his left arm and two more 
in his right the snoqualmie native said this is surely madness 
over a tv show that has no connection to real life

poorer countries such as sri lanka and costa 
rica have a higher quality of life than wealthier ones such as 
brazil because they put the poor ahead of the middle class or the 
military a un study says 
the report released today by the un development program found 
that nations such as sri lanka costa rica and botswana had a 
relatively high quality of life despite low gross national products 
but brazil pakistan and nigeria have conspicuously failed 
in using their resources to promote human wellbeing the report 
said 
the report calculated 130 nations human development index 
by charting life expectancy adult literacy and purchasing power 
over a 30year period ending in 1987 
japan parlayed its unparalleled prosperity into the top rating 
although there was little difference in the rankings of 
industrialized countries niger with an average income of 452 per 
person ranked last 
theres been tremendous progress in developing nations in the 
last 30 years but theres also been complacency there is a huge 
backlog of human deprivation in the developing world said 
project director mahbub ul haq 
sri lanka with its longtime commitment to health and education 
spending shows best that human development can be reached on 
fairly low income the study said 
its gross national product is only 92nd among the 130 countries 
but the country ranked 47th on the human development index higher 
than wealthier countries such as saudi arabia libya and brazil 
sri lanka had 87 percent literacy and a life expectancy of 71 
years compared with 43 percent and 59 years for neighboring india 
weve had a few economic troubles and internal troubles but 
we have continued to emphasize education and helping the poor 
said ag rana singhe of sri lankas un mission if we provide 
poor children with an education someday the whole country will 
come out of poverty 
costa rica which has no standing army ranks a high 28th 
because its life expectancy is 75 years its literacy rate is 93 
percent and its adjusted average income is 3760 
botswanas human development is among the highest in africa 
reflected in its 67 percent literacy rate and a track record of 
speedy relief for droughtstricken villages 
by contrast brazil has a life expectancy of 65 years a 78 
percent literacy rate and relatively high child mortality despite 
high incomes rapid economic growth and substantial social 
spending the report blames the extreme inequality of income 
distribution and public subsidy programs that benefit middleincome 
people more than the poor 
the report notes significant progress in the developing world 
over the 30year period life expectancy rose from 46 years in 1960 
to 62 in 1987 the under5 mortality rate was halved and primary 
health care was extended to 62 percent of the population 
but it notes an immense backlog of human deprivation 
particularly in africa and latin america 
there still are more than a billion people in absolute 
poverty nearly 900 million adults unable to read and write 175 
billion without safe drinking water around 100 million completely 
homeless some 800 million who go hungry every day 150 million 
children under 5 who are malnourished and 14 million children who 
die each year before their fifth birthday the report said 
among other findings 
there are eight times more soldiers than physicians in the 
third world physicians outnumber soldiers in developed countries 
the literacy rate for females in developing countries is only 
threequarters that of males although it has narrowed slightly in 
the last three decades and women typically work about 25 percent 
longer hours than men in developing nations but are paid less

canadian truck drivers blocked 
commercial border crossings to protest proposed tax increases and 
the uscanadian freetrade agreement but said their gripe isnt 
with american truckers 
more than 300 truckers parked their rigs along more than three 
miles of the highway leading to the ambassador bridge on wednesday 
about two dozen rigs also were on the bridge blocking truck 
traffic from detroit 
in sarnia hundreds of truckers at the blue water bridge idled 
their rigs putting truck traffic between sarnia and port huron 
mich on hold 
authorities at the bridges said cars were crossing without delay 
the ontario protests began tuesday quebec truckrs meanwhile 
continued to prevent us trucks from leaving or entering the 
province that protest began monday 
the protests were over planned increases in canadian taxes on 
everything from the goods they haul to the tires insurance and 
diesel fuel they buy said canadian truckers gathered near a fast 
food restaurant 
the canadian drivers complain that us drivers can undercut 
them because they arent paying nearly as much in taxes the 
uscanadian trade agreement which will remove by 1999 almost all 
tariffs on goods crossing the border will further handicap 
canadian truckers they said 
we want the government to take some of these taxes off of 
us said hollie greer a trucker from harrow who parked his truck 
in the row of rigs along huron church street in windsor they are 
taxing us to death 
greer a driver for can truck of windsor said organizers of the 
protest estimated that an american driver can run a load from 
flint mich about 350 miles for 116 a mile a canadian driver 
would pay about 236 a mile 
they are coming over taking good loads and all they are 
leaving behind is unemployment greer said he and other canadian 
drivers stressed however that the protest wasnt against us 
drivers but canadian government policy 
weve got nothing against the americans going over there 
said murray harvey of windsor whose rig was one of those on the 
canadabound side of the ambassador bridge just do it for the 
same price we are doing it for 
the freetrade agreement was signed last year 
us automakers whose plants were awaiting parts were keeping a 
close watch on the protest 
there will probably be some minor and very short disruptions 
in our system said ford motor co spokesman jim mcgraw the 
automaker has about 110 suppliers in southern ontario 
canadian automakers also were concerned 
theres no question its a tight situation said chrysler 
canada ltd spokesman walter mccall were watching this as a 
shiftbyshift basis

organizers of the goddess of democracy 
radio ship said today they have canceled plans to beam 
prodemocracy messages to china because of setbacks in obtaining 
crucial broadcasting equipment 
it was a difficult decision we are forced to abandon the 
broadcasting project said xu tianfang deputy secretary of the a 
boat for china association one of the main organizers 
he said organizers would sell the ship at auction and distribute 
tapes of the planned broadcasts to radio stations that can help 
transmit the messages to china 
the organizers said they formally announce the decision at news 
conferences in taipei and tokyo friday 
they had hoped to begin broadcasting to china before june 4 the 
first anniversary of chinas crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement the ship takes its name from a statue built by students 
in tiananmen square during the demonstrations 
organizers have accused the taiwan government of scuttling the 
project by refusing to allow chinese to board the ship to make 
broadcasts and by holding up the transmitter authorities here also 
have said they would not allow the ship to return for supplies once 
it has left port 
the taiwan government said it supported efforts to foster 
democracy in china but could not support the planned broadcasts 
which it said were against the law 
organizers have rejected the claim that their broadcasts would 
violate international law 
although taiwans ruling nationalist party is the sworn enemy of 
the beijing government tensions between the two sides have eased 
in recent years and taiwan is anxious not to anger beijing 
the 1200ton ship sponsored by the french magazine actuel and 
other publishing organizations and backed by the parisbased 
federation for a democratic china a dissident chinese group left 
france on march 17 it arrived in keelung harbor in northern taiwan 
may 13 to take on supplies including a transmitter sent from 
france 
but taiwanese customs authorities refused to release the 
transmitter on grounds that unauthorized radio broadcasts even 
from international waters would violate international agreements 
on wednesday the ship delayed its departure for japan as 
customs officials demanded export permits for fax machines 
telephones and other equipment that was to be loaded aboard 
japans chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said wednesday 
that japan would not allow the goddess of democracy to enter its 
ports because of the ships plan to make unauthorized broadcasts 
the ship had planned to head for japan in hopes of obtaining the 
necessary radio transmitter there

failure to update waterdepth charts 
caused a 400000gallon crude oil spill that blackened miles of 
scenic southern california beaches a final coast guard report 
concluded 
the refinery operating the offshore oil pipeline mooring and 
ships pilots who guide tankers to it were blamed for the february 
spill in the report released wednesday 
the 818foot tanker american trader carrying 568000 gallons of 
oil was maneuvering in water shallower than shown in 1975 depth 
charts when an ocean swell caused it to gash itself on its own 
anchor the report said 
the spill took place about 1 miles offshore in an area where 
shifting sand bars can alter water depth 
golden west refining co of santa fe springs failed to survey 
the mooring depth regularly the report said and mooring master 
capt john keon along with his employer capt robert 
brandenburger failed to be fully cognizant of accurate sea berth 
water depth information 
a mooring master is an independent local captain hired by vessel 
operators to guide large ships to offshore moorings 
refinery officials knew that depth surveys taken in 1981 and 
1983 showed the water depth was no more than 52 feet the report 
said pilots believed the water was 56 feet deep 
the tankers draft or portion below water was 43 feet while 
its anchor point stood about 4 feet above the bottom leaving at 
most a 5foot distance between the hull of the ship and the anchor 
tip the report said 
ocean swells the day of the accident ranged from 3 feet to 5 
feet 
capt david whitten director of the coast guards marine vessel 
inspection office said more frequent surveys would have shown the 
water had become too shallow to accommodate the tanker 
the oil spill fouled two harbors and about 15 miles of orange 
county shoreline up to 450 oilsoaked birds died 
roger kemple a senior vice president at golden west declined 
to comment wednesday saying he had not seen the report 
brandenburger also would not comment keon was at sea and could not 
be reached 
the report exonerated the tanker operator british petroleum oil 
shipping co usa and the crew of the american trader and its 
captain ar laware of responsibility in the spill 
the coast guard said it would take no action against keon or 
golden west who violated no laws for which the coast guard has 
enforcement responsibility 
but it said the tankers owner new yorkbased american trading 
and transport co may have violated the federal water pollution 
control act by dumping crude oil into the ocean 
in april the coast guard announced it would require monthly 
depth soundings at the mooring as well as checks before each 
tanker arrival

following is the full text of a speech given by 
emperor akihito at a banquet thursday to honor visiting south 
korean president roh taewoo the english translation was provided 
by the japanese foreign ministry 
your excellency the president of the republic of korea 
your excellency has come to pay a visit to this country with 
mrs roh taewoo in spite of the heavy pressure of affairs of 
state it is a matter of great significance and cause of utmost 
pleasure to me to be able to receive as a state guest your 
excellency the president who has led your country to its 
remarkable development i wish to offer my heartfelt welcome to 
your excellency and your party 
the korean peninsula and japan since ancient times have 
maintained close contact as the nearest neighbors even during the 
edo period when japan kept its doors closed to the outside world 
japan continued to receive korean missions and all the japanese 
people cordially welcomed them however while looking back upon 
the history of long fruitful exchanges between the korean 
peninsula and japan i recall what was stated by the late emperor 
showa it is indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate 
past between us for a period in this century and i believe it 
should not be repeated again i think of the sufferings your 
people underwent during this unfortunate period which was brought 
about by my country and cannot but feel the deepest regret 
having gone through such an era the relationship between our 
two countries has been restored to normality thanks to the staunch 
enthusiasm of those people in both countries in all circles and at 
all levels who have wishes for the revival of japankorea 
friendship and we now witness friendly and cooperative relations 
in all fields to all those concerned i should like to express my 
profound respect 
both japan and the republic of korea have now come to be 
expected to play important roles for the peace and prosperity of 
the world i earnestly hope that the people of our two countries 
will further deepen their mutual understanding make the relations 
between the two countries increasingly mature and jointly respond 
to this challenge 
i feel particularly reassured to see active exchanges between 
young people who are to take over responsibility in the coming 
age and the emergence from these exchanges of a new friendship to 
unite the two countries this new friendship will be the groundwork 
for the two countries to join forces in making a significant 
contribution to the future of mankind 
i believe that your excellencys current visit will lay a 
foundation for such a new relationship between our two countries 
that will continue into the 21st century 
i understand that your excellency will also visit the kansai 
area fortunately this is the season of fresh pleasant greenery 
it is my ardent hope that your excellency will find your stay in 
this country agreeable and meaningful 
may i now propose a toast to the good health and happiness of 
your excellency the president and mrs roh taewoo and to the 
further prosperity of the people of the republic of korea

following is the full text of a speech by south 
korean president roh taewoo during a banquet at the imperial 
palace in tokyo thursday the english translation was provided by 
the south korean government 
your majesties the emperor and empress esteemed members of the 
imperial family your excellencies prime minister and mrs kaifu 
distinguished guests 
i am grateful to you for so warmly welcoming my wife and me and 
honoring us with this splendid dinner i am also thankful for your 
majestys warm and friendly remarks about my country and people 
it is a great pleasure for me to visit japan as it is opening 
the new heisei era with your ascension to the throne and i 
consider it of utmost significance that today i have this historic 
opportunity to get to know your majesty and personally congratulate 
you on your becoming emperor i pay tribute to japan for having 
risen from the ashes of war and rebuilt itself into a peaceful and 
prosperous nation that is the envy of the world i am convinced 
that the heisei era will see peace prosperity and fellowship 
enhanced not only in japan but also throughout east asia and the 
whole world beyond 
from time immemorial to the present the two countries of korea 
and japan have had close contacts as nextdoor neighbors through 
interaction across a narrow strait our peoples have significantly 
influenced each others cultural development we have shared many 
good things together but in more modern times we experienced a 
painful phase also compared with the long history of neighborly 
and amicable association however the dark period was a relatively 
short one 
it is not possible to erase or forget historical facts 
nevertheless we must not remain bound up in memories our two 
nations must now forge a new era of friendship and cooperation 
based on a proper historical perspective putting the unfortunate 
past truly behind us it is significant that your majesty the 
symbol of japanese history and the new japanese nation has shown 
deep concern about this matter 
to ensure that our two nations will become close neighbors in 
spirit as well as geographically all of us now should strive to 
remove the dark shadow of history and negative residues of the past 
that have stood in the way of developing our bilateral ties in 
that way we should be able to bequeath wholesome bilateral ties to 
our posterity 
your majesty the 21st century is now fast approaching in the 
midst of tremendous upheavals the burning human desire for freedom 
and prosperity has rubbled the cold war structure drastically 
reshaping the global political landscape freedom and democracy 
ideals which both korea and japan have been pursuing have begun to 
prevail as universal values 
it has long been predicted that the 21st century will be the 
asiapacific age in the world today the relationship between 
korea and japan is therefore not a matter of importance for our two 
countries alone for our two nations ought to combine our efforts 
to take a leading role in promoting peace and prosperity throughout 
the asiapacific region an area which will become the cradle of a 
new civilization harmoniously blending things east and west 
furthermore our two nations should together make ever greater 
contributions to global prosperity and wellbeing this i believe 
is our responsibility before humanity and history 
looking back hoshu amenomori who was in charge of japanese 
relations with the choson kingdom some 270 years ago had as his 
motto sincerity and good faith hyon togyun his korean 
counterpart built songshindang the hall of sincerity and good 
faith in tongnae and met japanese envoys there likewise i am 
confident our bilateral ties will develop in the future in a spirit 
of mutual respect and understanding in pursuit of shared ideals and 
values 
i believe the future of koreajapan relations will be bright so 
long as we endeavor together with good faith and trust to build our 
ties from a global perspective as an oriental sage said the 
relationship between true gentlemen is placid just like calm 
water i believe friendly relations between our two nations 
should be like that also 
distinguished guests please join me in toasting the good 
health longevity and wellbeing of their majesties and the 
boundless prosperity of japan in the newly opened heisei era 
thank you

a wildcat strike that has halted rail 
service to polands busiest port and threatened the nations new 
economic reform program today spread eastward along the baltic 
coast the official news agency said 
in an apparent effort to win a settlement the government 
announced today that it had fired the director of the railway 
district in northwest poland where the strike began sunday night 
but when negotiations with unions began today the delegation 
representing the wildcat strikers did not appear 
the negotiations involve the labor minister the railway 
management the solidarity railway chapter and other unions 
according to transport ministry spokesman stefan pozniak 
the labor unrest including hunger strikes by 50 workers has 
produced a full blockade of rail traffic throughout the 
pomeranian region along the baltic coast including polands 
busiest port of szczecin railroad spokesman jacek wnukowski said 
pap the official news agency said the strike spread today to 
the rail station in the port of gydnia 220 miles east of szczecin 
in all a dozen key railroad junctures and a locomotive repair 
shop were idled and traffic from the industrial south to the ports 
was disrupted 
the army was moving perishable goods and essential supplies 
stalled by the four days of strikes and the government is trying 
to route shipments away from the area affected by the strike 
the government faced with the most serious challenge yet to its 
5monthold economic reform plan invited the rail unions to bring 
a threemember delegation from the wildcat strike committee to the 
talks in warsaw in what appeared to be a conciliatory gesture 
wednesday 
pozniak said it was not known why the delegation did not 
participate 
a spokesman for the strike committee based in slupsk said one 
representative left this morning for warsaw 260 miles to the 
southeast but it was not known when he would arrive 
the strikers who wanted government negotiators to meet with 
them in slupsk said on wednesday night that they were divided 
about whether to join the government talks 
the government refuses to negotiate directly with the workers 
because their strike was not endorsed by any union and it has 
ruled out immediate pay raises saying the demands would undermine 
the postcommunist reforms 
solidaritys leadership has called the strike a strong 
warning to the government it helped create but urged workers to 
negotiate a return to work 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz the architect of the 
dramatic overhaul of the socialist economy assured parliament this 
morning that prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and his top advisers 
consider it necessary to speed up reforms aimed at streamlining 
the railroads organization and reducing administrative workers 
in addition to seeking pay raises to 110 percent of the average 
national pay of about 80 monthly the strikers are seeking the 
dismissal of directors of the staterun railroad installed by the 
former communist regime they contend the old guard is incompetent 
and hampering reforms 
the dismissed pomerania director stefan maksymow was a deputy 
in the district before taking charge in august the transport 
ministry said 
the railway restructuring plan in the works before the strike 
includes new pay scales based on the results of the reforms and 
the inflation rate balcerowicz said but he added the 
government cannot meet salary demands that negate the possibility 
of success for the economic program 
the drive to create a marketdriven economy has cut government 
subsidies to staterun enterprises and barred pay raises that 
cannot be supported by the companies the government has vowed to 
make no exceptions to the reform program implemented jan 1 
the strict wage controls coupled with the raising of prices to 
market levels after years at unrealistically low rates based on 
government subsidies has reduced poles real incomes by an 
estimated 40 percent

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference thursday 
president bush well today after long and thorough 
deliberation i have determined that mfn status trade status for 
china should be extended for a year 
mfn is not a special favor its not a concession its the 
basis of everyday trade and taking mfn away is one thing i said i 
would not do that is in doing that take steps that would hurt 
the chinese people themselves i do not want to do that 
to express americas outrage at the tragedy of tiananmen the 
congress and my administration promptly enacted sanctions against 
china these sanctions remain basically unchanged today and while 
implementing those sanctions i have repeatedly made clear that i 
did not want to hurt the chinese people 
and this was a difficult decision weighing our impulse to lash 
out in outrage that we all feel against a sober assessment 
weighing that against a sober assessment of our nations longterm 
interests i concluded that it is in our best interest and the 
interest of the chinese people to continue chinas trade status 
not to do so would hurt the united states trade would drop 
dramatically hurting exporters consumers and investors 
china buys about 6 billion a year of american aircraft and 
wheat and chemicals lumber and other products lose this market 
and we lose american jobs aircraft workers in the west farmers 
in the great plains high tech employees in the northeast 
our economic competition will not join us in denying mfn 
without mfn an average of 40 percent higher costs for chinese 
imports will turn into higher prices for american consumers 
hong kong weighed on my mind hong kong would be an innocent 
victim of our dispute with beijing 20000 jobs and 10 billion 
could be lost in a colony that is a model of free enterprise spirit 
the united kingdom and chinas neighbors have urged me to 
continue mfn korea japan thailand singapore even taiwan made 
clear that mfn should be retained 
in recent weeks china has taken modest steps that appear 
intended to show responsiveness to our concerns beijing lifted 
martial law in tibet restored consular access there giving us a 
chance to judge the situation for ourselves 211 detainees were 
recently released and then their names provided for the first time 
while we welcome these and earlier steps they are lets face 
it far from adequate and i am not basing my decision on the steps 
that the chinese have taken so far most important of all as we 
mark the anniversary of tiananmen we must realize that by 
maintaining our involvement with china we will continue to promote 
the reforms for which the victims of tiananmen gave their lives 
the people in china who trade with us are the engine of reform 
opening to the outside world 
during the past 10 years weve seen our engagement in china 
contribute to the forces for justice and reason that were 
peacefully protested in beijing and our responsibility to them is 
best met not by isolating those forces from contact with us or by 
strengthening the hand of reaction but by keeping open the 
channels of commerce and communication 
our ambassador came to see me here in the oval office the other 
day and told me that not only the people that he is in contact 
with but the students there the intellectuals there all favor 
there in china favor the continuation of mfn 
so this is why i made the decision i have made and i will be 
glad to respond to questions i understand helen you are first 
q mr president every day the american people read a different 
figure on the savings and loan debacle what is the true figure 
what are you going to what does it all mean what are you going 
to do about it and what is the impact on the average taxpayer do 
you know the true figure

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and 
his west german counterpart met for more than five hours for talks 
on the drive toward german unification 
we took stock of the present situation in our relations 
shevardnadze said wednesday in that sense we have come to the 
conclusion that we have good and encouraging prospects ahead of 
us 
he said the officials discussed a wide range of issues 
including economic and trade relations and possible nato membership 
for a future united germany which moscow so far has ruled out 
the oneday meeting at the soviet mission to the united nations 
was the second between the foreign ministers in three weeks west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said they agreed to 
meet again on a date to be determined 
shevardnadze denied reports suggesting moscow is tying 
acceptance of an eastwest pact on cutting conventional forces to 
an agreement on the size of the armed forces in a united germany 
we did discuss cuts in armed forces and armament in europe 
from the atlantic to the urals he told reporters the first 
priority is of course to sign a treaty on conventional cuts in 
europe 
shevardnadze said both sides favored speeding up the vienna 
talks on conventional forces the west has accused the soviets of 
stalling 
we advocated an acceleration of the vienna negotiations he 
said 
shevardnadze said there was a useful discussion on the 
question of whether a united germany should belong to nato that 
is a very tricky issue and i dont think that you can expect an 
agreement to be achieved right now 
on military issues moscow has taken a hard line in the 
socalled twoplusfour talks on german unity they include the 
two german states and the four world war ii allies the soviet 
union the united states britain and france 
the soviets fearing the reemergence of a military superpower 
at the heart of europe are pressing to negotiate the size of a 
united germanys armed forces in the sixnation talks 
west germany wants to wrap up those negotiations by the end of 
the year in a major step last friday east and west germany signed 
an accord to merge into a single economy on july 2

television journalist diane sawyer has been 
subpoenaed to appear at imelda marcos fraud trial to testify about 
an interview she did with the former philippine first lady in 1986

in a may 22 letter to us district judge john keenan 
prosecutors said they want sawyer to authenticate a segment of 
her interview that they plan to present as evidence 
sawyer conducted the interview while working for the cbs news 
show 60 minutes 
a cbs attorney helen gold said the network would ask the judge 
to quash the subpoena which is returnable friday 
sawyer is now employed by abc a spokeswoman there said sawyer 
had no comment 
in the segment mrs marcos denied writing the signature on a 
swiss bank record the document which is already in evidence at 
the trial reflects the opening of an account in the name jne 
ryan 
prosecutors claim jane ryan is a fictitious name for mrs 
marcos they said the handwriting on the document has been 
identified as mrs marcos 
mrs marcos attorneys are seeking to keep the jury from seeing 
the tape or hearing sawyers testimony they argue that the march 
21 1986 bank document predates the start of the alleged 
conspiracy for which mrs marcos is on trial 
the interview taped in hawaii was conducted after mrs marcos 
husband ferdinand e marcos was ousted as president of the 
philippines in feb 1986 it aired on sept 21 1986 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband embezzle 
more than 220 million from their countrys treasury to secretly

about 5000 demonstrators defied a 
government ban today and protested what they claimed was the 
governing partys fraudulent victory in romanias first multiparty 
elections after 44 years of communism 
down with iliescu they shouted in a downtown square that 
has been the focus of antigovernment and anticommunist protests 
for a month 
the government of presidentelect ion iliescu had said the 
protest was unauthorized and police detained three people who 
helped organize the rally only a few traffic police were in sight 
when the demonstration began however 
opposition leaders say iliescus national salvation front is led 
by excommunists who they believe stole sundays election numerous 
foreign observers pointed to voting irregularities but most said 
they did not significantly affect the outcome 
one of three rally organizers was detained in the southern town 
of lehliu carrying 40000 leaflets police said the other two were 
detained in bucharest a spokesman for the police press department 
told the associated press he said the three were only identified 
and not charged but he declined to say if they were later released 
for the third day police appealed to citizens to turn in anyone 
seen distributing the handbills 
premier petre roman told reporters wednesday the demonstration 
against the national salvation front has blocked central university 
square for 33 days and was impermissible now that the 
government had the legitimacy of being elected 
when iliescu was asked if he would send police to clear the 
square he told reporters he would apply no force i hope 
crowds of several hundred to several thousand have filled the 
square each day chanting down with communism clubwielding 
police briefly broke up the protest a few days after it started 
but they have since left it alone 
at the news conference iliescu reiterated his claim that he has 
made a complete break with his communist past iliescu was a 
minister in the government of dictator nicolae ceausescu but fell 
out with him in the 1970s ceausescu was toppled and executed in 
the december revolution 
iliescu said he wants the new government to include competent 
people regardless of party affiliation 
romanias break with communism was the most brusque and 
revolutionary in all east europe the presidentelect said 
there is no way back and to try such a thing would be political 
suicide 
he said the new governments priorities would be the drafting of 
a new constitution and development of a coherent strategy for 
transition to a freemarket economy 
the parliament has 18 months to draw up the new constitution 
elections are to be held within a year of its adoption 
some western diplomats and other observers have expressed 
concern that a parliament dominated by the front could write a 
constitution enshrining itself in power 
iliescu said his challengers radu campeanu of the national 
liberal party and ion ratiu of the national peasant party lost 
because they misunderstood the character of the revolution and 
slid to the extreme right 
the opposition leaders platforms differed from that of the 
front mainly in their call for a quicker transition to a market 
economy 
the vocal studentled protesters failed to win support from 
rural and working class people a near final tally of the vote 
released wednesday showed iliescu with 85 percent of the votes for 
president and his national salvation front with 67 percent of the 
votes for the twochamber parliament

raising taxes on the richest americans would 
mean less takehome pay for the average taxpayer a study prepared 
for house republicans concluded today 
the house republican research committee released the study as 
part of a campaign to have president bush stick by his pledge to 
oppose any tax increase for deficit reduction 
the institute for policy innovation a lewisville texas 
research organization analyzed a proposal to raise to 33 percent 
the 28 percent top incometax rate on the 600000 wealthiest 
americans such an increase is advocated by many democrats in 
congress 
those who hope to redistribute income to the poor by 
increasing tax progressivity may actually harm intended 
beneficiaries the institute concluded in this case average 
taxpayers end up worse off by over 500 
in a complex integrated economy any narrowly directed tax 
rapidly becomes a tax on everyone the study said 
according to the analysis raising the top tax rate on the very 
rich would slow the economy reduce investment and over the next 
decade cost 377000 jobs that otherwise would be created that 
would result in a reduction of aftertax income that if spread 
among all taxpayers at all levels would cost 534 a year on the 
average 
the study said that by the year 2000 the tax increase would 
result in a 435ayear loss of aftertax income for a taxpayer 
making between 30000 and 45000 and 123864 for one making 
over 750000

president bush today conceded his summit next 
week with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev would produce few signed 
agreements but promised to seek significnt progress on arms talks 
and other superpower disputes 
i dont want to have two ships pass in the night bush said 
weve got a lot to talk about 
bush said the lack of formal agreements should not be viewed as 
a sign the summit will be a failure 
i dont want to overpromise but i dont want to act like i 
think its some kind of dance bush told a white house news 
conference what were going to talk about is really 
substantive 
specifically he listed the tension in lithuania and other 
secessionist baltic states german unification chemical and 
nuclear weapons and conventional troop levels in europe as items on 
the agenda 
bush said he could not offer preferential trade treatment to the 
soviets yet because the soviet legislature has not passed suitable 
emigration laws guaranteeing soviet jews and other ethnic groups 
that they can leave the country 
i think there is a political climate in this country that 
would make it extremely difficult to grant the trade benefits to 
the soviets bush said 
and the president said he had no problems with the agreement on 
reductions in longrange nuclear weapons secretary of state james 
a baker iii negotiated with moscow bush and gorbachev are to sign 
off on the broad details of that deal but the specifics still are 
being negotiated 
there is no light between us on that at all bush said when 
asked if he thought baker gave away too much it is a sound 
position 
baker on wednesday defended the arms control declaration against 
critics mostly conservative columnists who have accused him of 
giving too much ground in his negotiations last week in moscow 
there is very strong support for this agreement among the 
military leadership of the united states support for it as a 
good agreement that is very much in the national security interests 
of the united states baker said at a news conference 
and it would appear to me at least that most of the criticism 
is coming from those who in the past from time to time have 
simply rejected the concept of arms control generally he told 
reporters at the white house 
the agreement is not in the form of a treaty that could take 
months maybe years of negotiations to conclude so far the two 
sides have been at it for eight years already and the draft text 
runs more than 400 pages 
rather bush and gorbachev will declare their intention to 
reduce longrange nuclear bombers missiles and submarines by 30 to 
35 percent overall a promise that treaty technicians would be 
under instruction to fulfill 
thats less than the 50 percent cutback advertised by the reagan 
administration when the talks began in geneva in 1982 but the 50 
percent figure still holds for reductions in the soviets 
landbased ss18 missiles their most powerful nuclear weapon 
the pentagon on the other hand will have far more elbow room 
to hold on to their favorite nuclear weapons 
some of the criticism is based on the fact that baker without 
public announcement agreed in moscow that the soviets could do 
some limited testing of an updated version of the powerful rockets 
he also accepted the soviet cutoff of 375 miles for airlaunched 
cruise missiles that would be excluded those with ranges above 375 
miles would be subject to restrictions 
initially the united states wanted no restrictions up to 625 
miles 
but on most points baker prevailed including the right to 
count nucleartipped cruise missiles aboard 150 b52 bombers as 
numbering l0 apiece even though up to 20 could be packed aboard 
that means 50 percent of the weapons would not be counted 
also there would be no verification of the number of cruises 
carried aboard ships that is an area in which the united states 
has a commanding edge 
us and soviet negotiators meeting at the state department in 
the days before the summit might manage to settle differences over 
some other strategic weapons and add them to the declaration bush 
and gorbachev will announce 
but the script could be deprived of a new ussoviet trade 
agreement because the soviet parliament has not concluded passage 
of a new righttotravel law 
the soviets had been expected to pass the law may 31 as the 
summit opened but baker said the action has been postponed 
somewhat 
the law would remove virtually all obstacles to emigration of 
jews and other soviet citizens who would like to live in another 
country 
even without it some 20000 exit permits are to be granted this 
month but jewish groups and others adamant about the right to 
travel wanted the law on the books as soon as possible 
the new law and a trade agreement were the two preconditions set 
by the president for recommending to congress a oneyear waiver of 
high tariffs against soviet goods entering the united states 
as for the offstage threat that lithuania could upset the summit 
script baker said the bush administration was determined to 
prevent that from happening 
there is too much at stake he said to dismiss 
cavalierly the potential for progress in ussoviet relations 
bush and baker are under pressure to treat gorbachev coolly 
unless the soviet leader drops his demand that independence 
resolutions in lithuania latvia and estonia be suspended

researchers say they have increased the amount of 
current that bulk samples of high temperature superconducting 
materials can carry a possible step toward making them practical 
in one experiment a sample of experimental superconductor 
carried 10 times the amount of current that standard 
superconducting materials do the university of houston said in a 
statement 
superconductors are materials that carry electricity without 
resistance the materials discovered so far must be made very cold 
to work recently hightemperature superconductors have been 
created that operate at higher temperatures than standard 
superconductors which are widely used in medical technology and 
other areas 
one problem with hightemperature materials is that the amount 
of electrical current they can carry has been limited 
but university of houston researchers say that by using special 
techniques to prepare a sample of superconducting material they 
produced high currentcarrying capacity at both very low and 
relatively high temperatures 
for example at about minus 451 degrees fahrenheit the sample 
carried 20 million amperes per square centimeter of crosssection 
when exposed to a magnetic field of a certain strength and 8 
million amps per square centimeter in a field 10 times as strong 
that performance is more than 10 times what conventional 
superconductors can do the university said 
at minus 321 degrees the sample carried 1 million amps per 
square centimeter in the absence of a magnetic field and 200000 
amps per square centimeter when exposed to a magnetic field 
the research team included cw paul chu peiherng hor and 
others at the texas center for superconductivity at the university 
their work is scheduled to be published in the journal modern 
physics letters 
malcolm beasley a professor of applied physics at stanford 
university called the work a very useful step toward practical 
use

q well are you made particularly uncomfortable sir by the 
fact that our support for the noncommunist resistance has the 
effect at least since they are fighting alongside the khmer 
rouge of helping the notorious khmer rouge 
a to the degree it has any effect to help them yes i am 
uncomfortable about it but when we have this kind of compromise 
that has been worked out at it at this juncture i think were 
on the right track but theres a discomfort level for it because 
of the brutality of the khmer rouge and if anybody even perceives 
that were trying to help those people why then it does cause 
discomfort but i think were on the right track we are reviewing 
the whole policy now yes 
q mr president this morning the soviet government 
specifically the prime minister rejected lithuanias latest 
compromise offer to get talks going are you disappointed that 
moscow seems to be persisting in this hard line and what do you 
plan to tell president gorbachev when you about lithuania 
a michael i was encouraged when the prime minister having 
made her swing of the united states and other countries 
prunskiene went to moscow i was encouraged when she was received 
by mr gorbachev i cant tell you i am encouraged about where it 
stands right now i have told you told the american people that 
this lithuanian situation and indeed the situation regarding the 
baltics whose incorporation into the soviet union we have never 
recognized does cause certain tensions and jim baker had a very 
frank discussion with president gorbachev about that he 
understands from jim baker and frankly from me directly how we 
feel about this so i wish i could give you a more optimistic 
assessment because but the answer the only answer to this 
question lies in dialogue between the affected parties and i was 
encouraged when prunskiene met with mr gorbachev but i have no 
reason now to report to the american people further encouragement 
q if i could follow up about a month or so ago you said that 
you thought mr gorbachev was showing willingness to compromise and 
the lithuanians only showing some willingness to compromise is 
that still your assessment or have you reviewed the balance on 
that 
a well i youre presenting me with some some semantic 
difference that i did not intend to make but i im not here to 
assess blame what im here to do is to assess the you know to 
try to encourage a dialogue on this important question it is 
extraordinarily difficult for both sides and i think president 
gorbachev is concerned not just about the baltics but about other 
republics and i think the lithuanians understandably are 
concerned about their freedom and their right to 
selfdetermination although the soviet union still says 
selfdetermination is proper theyve got a difference on 
referendum they have other differences john 
q mr president critics of this decision on china believe it 
is based too heavily on a blind faith that you have in those 
leaders based on your experience as envoy over there what message 
does this send to the younger generation of chinese leaders who are 
going to come along and replace those in power now 
a it says that economic contacts are the best way to keep the 
economic reforms going forward it says that the more economic 
contacts we have with china the more they are going to see the 
fruits of free market economies i have told you that the students 
in china according to our ambassador want to see this mfn 
continue and so it should send no message other than that 
isolation is bad and economic involvement is good and economic 
the whole fact that weve had economic involvement i think has 
moved china more towards reform than if we hadnt had it and so i 
want to see it continue and that is the message to the people 
because it has some will interpret the way youve said and i 
will say it has nothing to do with that it has nothing to do with 
that at all we have certain sanctions in place they remain in 
place china has got an emigration policy going that qualifies and 
you have interests of taiwan says keep it going hong kong says 
keep it going three editorials in this country well maybe many 
many more i think who were upset with the fact that i opted for 
executive action instead of legislation all support continuation 
of mfn and those people who were on my case if you will about 
the decision i took which i still think was the correct decision 
are now saying continue mfn so

q are you satisfied that these students who now say that they 
favor the policy arent doing that under some duress since the 
crackdown by the regime in beijing 
a no because i think you wouldnt see you wouldnt see all 
these other interests out there if it was simply that maybe 
theres some pressure on them i dont know but thats not what 
our ambassadors telling me he had to 
q your favorite subject taxes some of the polls are 
a texas 
q taxes laughter 
a is that what you mean i thought you were talking about the 
texas economic summit 
q several polls including one broadcast last night are 
showing that most americans think that there will be taxes and 
about half in fact they think youll go along with taxes and 
about half say theyre willing to go along with taxes themselves if 
the case can be proven that taxes are needed does this give you 
more leeway as you make your decision 
a look i have stated right here at this podium that im not 
going to go into the details of these what might be discussed up 
there ive said that theres no preconditions im satisfied with 
the way the process is going indeed i should give credit to mr 
gephardt for the conduct of these initial meetings our people 
dick darman nick brady john sununu up there all working in good 
faith and ive seen those surveys but it is way too early to 
start talking about remedies here i want to let that process go 
forward and then when i get agreement i will go out and say to

gone to the american people to suggest remedies do you not want to 
go into the economic summit and say to the to your fellow world

american people that its going to take sacrifice are you ready to 
do at least that 
a im going to outline the problem when we get agreement so we

the money and raises all the revenues thats their obligation and 
im not one to dwell on surveys recently but i will point out that 
people understand that the congress bears a greater responsibility 
for this but im not trying to assign blame thats why im not

mfn at this point to the soviet union

a state police officer who complained 
about a sex quiz handed out at a training session is under 
investigation for sending a copy to alert his boss his attorney 
said 
to make a complaint about sexually offensive material and 
then be charged with distributing sexually offensive material for 
complaining it just defies description attorney alan legum said 
wednesday 
we think this has a tremendous chilling effect especially on 
minorities said legum who represents department of natural 
resources officer michael g sewell 
sewell president of the black officers association said in 
his may 10 letter to dnr secretary torrey c brown that the quiz he 
called sexist reminded him of a file of racist jokes that sparked a 
1985 lawsuit against the department 
sewell enclosed a copy of the official game warden sex quiz 
which had been distributed apparently as a joke by an officer 
conducting a training program may 8 in caroline county legum said 
if this test is an indication of his feelings for females 
then what is it for blacks and how does another black female even 
stand a chance to get hired sewell wrote 
monday a formal complaint was filed against sewell for mailing 
the material to brown 
in a statement wednesday brown said the agency launched an 
investigation the day the quiz was distributed because it was 
totally inappropriate and offensive brown said appropriate 
actions were being taken against those involved declining to be 
specific because personnel matters are confidential 
without naming sewell brown said that an officer wrote to 
superiors about the incident and sent copies of the letter with the 
sex quiz attached to numerous persons outside the agency 
this conduct too has been determined to merit appropriate 
action brown said 
legum said sewell was that officer and the only complaint so far 
brought against him was for mailing the quiz to brown sewell has 
said he did send other copies outside the agency 
departmental charges carry punishments ranging from verbal 
reprimand to dismissal 
the onepage quiz featured 24 truefalse statements playing off 
sexual puns according to a copy provided to the annapolis 
capital by annapolis alderman carl o snowden 
in his letter to brown sewell compared the jokes to a file of 
racist and ethnic jokes found in the dnr police radio room the 
discovery prompted a lawsuit and 26000 settlement 
in 1986 the agency agreed to punish the distribution of similar 
material as part of a settlement to a bias suit brought by the 
departments black officers 
when the second suit was filed the dnrs 203member police 
force had four black officers the force which patrols state lands 
and waterways now has 14 black officers and 14 women officers 
among a staff of 226

a well i think theres a political climate in this country 
that would make it extraordinarily difficult to grant it but that 
is not a bridge were having to cross at this juncture because the 
because the legislation is not in place in the soviet union 
q but it is a bridge that youre going to have to cross when 
that legislation is in place and it seems 
a well but lets hope theres some progress on the lithuanian 
question because i think many feel theres a direct linkage there 
and i must say it concerns me yes 
q in what way sir 
a hmm 
q in what way 
a because i want to see these negotiations start and i want to 
see this emigration law pass and theres a lot of things going on 
that are going to affect the whole climate of the economic aspects 
of this summit 
q id like to ask you about the climate of the summit the 
soviets have slowed down the negotiations on conventional arms 
control you are not going to be signing a start treaty which wed 
been led to believe was going to be the centerpiece of this summit 
it looks like there wont be any kind of trade treaty signed has 
the summit changed from one of consolidating gains and moving ahead 
to just trying to get the relationship back on track 
a i wouldnt phrase it exactly that way you may recall that i 
mentioned in here in answer to the question whos the enemy 
instability unpredictability and it would seem to me that i would 
repeat that and i dont want to have two ships pass in the night 
the soviet union and the united states and weve got a lot to talk 
about i dont want to by answering the question this way 
indicate i dont think there will be significant progress on start 
i hope we can move things forward on cfe indeed i was heartened 
by what shevardnadze and genscher talked about yesterday that was 
somewhat encouraging 
chemical weapons i hope ive expressed with great enthusiasm 
and passion my desire to do something about chemical weapons and 
it looks to me like we are very very close there so weve got a 
lot of things that i think will be seen properly as progress but 
theres enormous problems that just need to be talked about where i 
cant say there will be an answer and i would refer you to the 
highly complex question of german unification of forces that 
where forces will be deployed and whose forces will be deployed 
after german unification we got questions on borders weve got a 
lot of things to discuss that might not result in a signed 
agreement 
q considering all those things and especially the lithuanian 
situation is your personal relationship with mr gorbachev changed 
coming into this summit 
a well ill have to wait and see what he says when he gets 
here but i feel that the man has got some enormous problems hes 
made some enormous progress i think he knows from talking to jim 
baker after he got back that were not trying to undermine him or 
make life complicated for him but we have certain certain 
differences with the soviet union which were ill be perfectly 
prepared to talk about so you know its a good question and we 
were talking about it before coming in here because i dont want 
to overpromise but i dont want to act like i think its just 
you know some kind of a dance out there of on this meeting 
because what were going to talk about is really substantive and i 
think the part where we can sit and talk at camp david there im 
glad the soviets have agreed to that because i think its in that 
kind of a session that i can after which ill probably be better 
better able to answer the question you asked about the 
relationship itself yes 
q mr president the conflict in israel mr president the 
conflict in israel between the israelis and the palestinians seems 
to become increasingly violent 
a yes 
q do you think the israelis at this point are acting 
appropriately and responsibly

most of east germanys antiterrorist unit is 
made up of former members of the ousted communist regimes feared 
secret police a government spokesman said today 
the interior ministry official said 109 of the 149 members of 
the special police unit worked previously as agents for the 
domestic security network known as the stasi which has been 
disbanded 
the remaining 40 members came from the east german army the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the antiterrorist unit was formed in december under the 
reformoriented caretaker government led by premier hans modrow 
who ran east germany after the communist hardliners were ousted in 
november 
modrows retooled communist party was voted out of power in the 
nations first democratic elections on march 18 
but the spokesman said none of the former secret police working 
in the special unit took part in the violent crackdown on 
demonstrations on oct 78 that helped fuel the peaceful revolt 
that ousted the former regime 
east germany is embroiled in debate over what to do with the 
80000 people who worked for the stasi which used a network of 
surveillance and informants to enforce the rule of the former 
communist government 
some people have demanded investigations of former stasi members 
and the estimated 100000 informants and those who worked with 
them others argue the network was so vast that the investigation 
would amount to a witchhunt 
but many former bureaucrats intelligence specialists and law 
enforcement officials are considered by some people to be too 
valuable and experienced to be removed from their jobs 
prime minister lothar de maiziere and his cabinet on wednesday 
gave a vote of confidence to the embattled interior minister 
petermichael diestel who is reluctant to remove former stasi 
members from the domestic security network 
many lawmakers including those from diestels own 
archconservative german social union have demanded the interior 
ministers resignation because of his propensity for hiring or 
retaining security specialists from the old regime 
opposition lawmakers say diestel has more than 2000 former 
members of the stasi on the payroll 
diestel on wednesday announced the formation of a new committee 
to oversee the dissolution of the stasi and to decide what to do 
with files kept on an estimated 6 million east germans 
the committee includes prominent east german authors stefan heym 
and walter janka church leaders and members of a former citizens 
committee set up by the modrow government

prime minister toshiki kaifu apologized today and 
emperor akihito expressed deepest regret for japans harsh 
colonial rule over korea in statements designed to put the 
nations bitter past behind them 
south korean president roh taewoo met kaifu and the emperor on 
the first day of a threeday state visit that is a carefully 
scripted attempt by the two countries to move ahead as partners in 
spreading peace and prosperity 
for japan which normalized relations with south korea in 1965 
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering 
it inflicted during its stifling 19101945 rule of korea 
at a state banquet roh said the two countries should strive 
to remove the dark shadow of history but koreans had hoped for a 
more direct apology from the emperor 
in south korea thousands of radical students burned japanese 
flags and fought with police today they shouted slogans that rohs 
trip was a sellout to national pride 
feelings still run high in south korea over japanese colonial 
abuses koreans had to study japanese in school and were taught to 
worship the japanese emperor koreans were drafted into the 
japanese army and into forced labor in japan hundreds of thousands 
died in wartime service to japan 
little of this is known in japan and the history is skimmed over 
in schools lately however japanese media have given crash 
courses in japankorea history with graphic photos and films of 
japanese atrocities 
security was heavy for rohs visit about 20000 police were 
mobilized in tokyo to prevent attacks by rightist and leftist 
extremists who threatened to disrupt the event protest rallies 
were held in tokyo 
after a 21gun salute roh and his wife were received at tokyos 
official guest house by emperor akihito empress michiko kaifu and 
dozens of other japanese officials and members of the imperial 
family 
later kaifu delivered what foreign ministry spokesman taizo 
watanabe said was a stronger apology than any by previous prime 
ministers and a more direct acknowledgement of japans 
responsibility 
kaifu told roh that japan and south korea must clearly and 
honestly articulate the realities of events that have so 
regrettably marred our past relations watanabe told reporters 
kaifu expressed his sincere remorse and honest apologies for 
the fact that there was a period in our history in which japans 
action inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of 
the korean peninsula watanabe said 
he quoted roh as saying kaifus statement reflects a correct 
recognition of history 
watanabe said the seoul government had been informed in advance 
of what the prime minister and the emperor would say 
at the state banquet attention was focused on the okotoba 
the emperors speech the seoul government had asked that akihito 
apologize for japans actions in korea and wanted him to state 
japans responsibility 
when rohs predecessor chun doohwan made the only previous 
visit by a south korean president in 1984 the late emperor 
hirohito left the koreans dissatisfied with a vague statement 
expressing regret about the unfortunate past between the two 
countries 
akihito never used the word apology in his brief speech 
government officials will use that word in later meetings but he 
made a point of quoting hirohitos words in 1984 and he said more 
hirohito had said it is indeed regrettable that there was an 
unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and i 
believe it should not be repeated again 
akihito went on to say i think of the sufferings your people 
underwent during this unfortunate period which was brought about 
by my country and cannot but feel the deepest regret 
he also praised south koreas economic advancement and said he 
hoped the people of the two countries would together play 
important roles for the peace and prosperity of the world 
in seoul officials indicated they were generally satisfied with 
akihitos speech vice foreign minister yoo chongha said i 
think the japanese government has made tremendous efforts to 
satisfy our position 
in his reply roh said the dark period in relations between 
the neighboring countries had been short and it was time to put 
the unfortunate past truly behind us 
the 21st century will be the asiapacific age he said and 
relations between the two countries would make a difference to the 
wider world 
for our nations ought to combine our efforts to take a leading 
role in promoting peace and prosperity through the asiapacific 
region an area which will become the cradle of a new civilization 
harmoniously blending things east and west he said

marla maples touted her new jeans ads in her 
first press conference since emerging as the alleged other woman in 
the breakup of donald trumps marriage but trumps wife ivana 
stole the spotlight 
two process servers hired by mrs trump slapped maples with 
legal papers wednesday requiring the actress to tell about her 
friendship with trump an attorney for mrs trump michael kennedy 
said he wants maples to reveal how long she was seeing trump 
without mrs trumps knowledge 
maples tried to avoid questions about the trumps at the press 
conference to announce her new 600000 contract as a spokeswoman 
for no excuses jeans the ad campaign kicks off in august 
in 1987 no excuses capitalized on the fleeting fame of another 
alleged other woman donna rice whose reported liaison with 
gary hart resulted in his withdrawal from the 1988 presidential 
race 
anticipating the question before it was asked the 26yearold 
maples refused to discuss her relationship with trump i dont 
want to comment on that hes still working on his own personal 
situation 
the trumps neither of whom has filed for divorce are haggling 
over the terms of a 25 million postnuptial agreement the master 
deal maker says the agreement is ironclad mrs trump disagrees and 
wants more 
maples was eating lunch after her appearance when the process 
servers approached her table and slapped the papers down in front 
of her you are hereby served she was told 
maples let the papers fall and walked out so it was not clear 
whether she was properly served 
though she would not take questions from reporters about trump 
maples did talk about being the subject of months of sensational 
headlines 
i havent been to my apartment but for one day so im sort of 
borrowing friends clothes id love to go to the grocery store and 
do some shopping i feel everything i do is getting reported 
much of that she realizes is the result of her selfimposed 
exile 
she said she chose to go into hiding because i didnt want to 
get involved i wanted to try and pull attention away from me 
she added of course we all know it didnt happen that way 
photographers dogged her the national enquirer offered her 1 
million to tell all when that failed they offered money to anyone 
in her hometown of dalton ga for marla stories the star 
went one up on the enquirer offering her even more money playboy

she smiled sweetly wednesday for hungry photographers who barked 
orders at her marla this way marla turn around marla right 
here all the while answering reporters questions no matter 
how outrageous

a university filed the first legal challenge of 
a noobscenity pledge federal arts grant recipients must sign to 
receive their money 
the new school for social research argued in a federal lawsuit 
filed wednesday that the pledge required by the national endowment 
of the arts is unconstitutional 
the school is up for a 45000 grant to build a sculpture garden 
at its manhattan campus 
it is the first time the pledge sent to more than 4000 grant 
recipients has been challenged in court said attorney floyd 
abrams a first amendment specialist who represents the school 
besides being unconstitutionally vague the pledge goes beyond 
the us supreme courts definition of obscenity school president 
jonathan f fanton said 
last month theater producer joseph papp turned down a 50000 
federal grant rather than sign the pledge 
fanton said the school learned in march that its grant 
application to redesign a greenwich village courtyard into a 
sculpture garden had been approved but it was unwilling to sign 
the pledge he said 
we came very quickly to the conclusion that we really could 
not accept a grant that impinged on freedom of expression the 
president said 
the arts endowment on wednesday declined to comment on the 
lawsuit until it had a chance to study it 
in a letter to fanton earlier this month nea chairman john 
frohnmayer wrote we too have severe questions about the 
constitutionality of this law but that does not mean we can choose 
to ignore it 
two controversial photographic exhibits supported by national 
endowment money prompted congress last year to put strings on 
government aid to the arts forbidding the financing of works that 
might be considered obscene the restrictions are to last one year 
the legislation bars subsidies for art depicting 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of 
children or individuals engaged in sex acts which when taken as a 
whole do not have serious literary artistic political or 
scientific value 
the arts endowment requires grant winners to pledge not to use 
the federal funds for projects that may be considered obscene 
according to the legislations definition of obscenity 
in a 1973 decision the supreme court said that in order to be 
obscene material must violate community standards depict clearly 
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value 
abrams argued that the endowment conditions go beyond that 
definition by specifying categories 
it is possible that michelangelos david could be considered 
an example of homoerotic art he said 
in its lawsuit the new school seeks a preliminary injunction 
restraining the endowment and frohnmayer from requiring it to sign 
the pledge before receiving the grant it also asks the court to 
declare the requirement unconstitutional 
a hearing date in us district court was scheduled for june 14 
the new school was established in 1919 by intellectuals 
concerned about limitations on academic freedom at traditional 
universities today it includes among other schools the graduate 
faculty of political and social science parsons school of design 
and mannes college of music

a well i have called on both sides for restraint ive called 
on the israeli forces to show constraint im worried about it i 
am troubled about the loss of human life in this area i am deeply 
troubled about well totally human life but i think 
particularly of children in this kind of situation and the answer 
is to get these talks going and i will do everything i can to to 
get the talks for peace going and so were talking i was on the 
phone yesterday i think it was with mubarak and we had very good 
talks prebaghdad summit with ben ali here who is represents a 
friendly country were talking to a lot of people about how that 
can go but yes i am very troubled by this 
q well mr president is there anything that the united states 
can do with its enormous clout with israel to push the israelis to 
be more open to these peace talks 
a well the problem we face right now is this almost an 
interregnum i mean theres no firm decisionmaking government in 
place so were in a bit of a hiatus because of that yes 
q mr president yes do you think that the relations with 
mexico are going to be damaged now that mexico is asking for the 
extradition or the return of dr alvarez machain 
a no 
q and i would like to follow up 
a the answer is no go ahead and follow up 
q yes what can be done in that case are you going to return 
him are you going to 
a well im not going to get into that because we have some 
matters in the court on that question but the reason i answered 
and i wasnt being flip about it that relationship is too 
important that no incident is going to disrupt it the respect i 
feel for president salinas is shared by the american people the 
determination to keep this relationship that has already moved 
forward continuing to move forward is shared by the american 
people today ill be meeting with some parliamentarians a group 
incidentally that i belonged to 20 lets see how many 22some 
years ago and im sure some of these questions will come up but 
im not going to go into anything that might conflict with the 
legal problem but i did be sure that the president of mexico 
knows that we did not grab that doctor and americans did not do 
that i think that has helped somewhat yes right here 
q mr president your administration has raised the likelihood 
of a veto of senate legislation that bans several types of 
semiautomatic weapons and we see that youre supporting 
legislation republican legislation that doesnt even include 
your own proposal which would have restricted the ammunition 
capacity of these weapons why is it that you insist on having a 
different standard for these domestically produced weapons than you 
do for imports 
a look rita i have not changed my position on clips 
ammunition clips i read in the paper somewhere that we had 
changed it and backed off of that position that isnt true i sent 
a crime bill however to the congress and id like to it enacted 
a law enforcement bill congress knows of the difficulties you saw 
it passed yesterday by one vote this ban i am not supporting that 
and i wish the congress wouldnt keep adding matters of this 
nature lets get a good strong anticrime bill and then we can 
have an open debate again on whatever they want to talk about 
but all i can do is perfect legislation by saying here is what i 
can accept and here is what i cant and if they want to add 
something on these clips thats fine itd have my strong support 
the automatic weapon part does not have my strong support

fiji ordered the indian embassy closed and 
expelled its diplomats because of indias support for this nations 
democratic opposition india today called fijis government illegal 
and discriminatory 
relations between india and the south pacific nation of fiji 
have been strained since 1987 when col sitiveni rabuka now army 
chief staged two coups that toppled the indiandominated elected 
government of timoci bavadra 
rabuka claimed he was protecting the interests of indigenous 
fijians who are now outnumbered by ethnic indians 
fijis order wednesday followed new delhis announcement on may 
10 that it would launch an international campaign against what it 
called discrimination against indians in fiji the indian embassy 
closed its doors today and took down its flag before a noon 
deadline 
the ministry of foreign affairs said on wednesday that indias 
planned antifiji campaign and a trade ban that has been imposed 
since the coups were unfriendly and unwarranted acts 
it also accused the indian embassy of continued interference 
in its internal affairs but gave no specifics 
the opposition coalition said in a statement that the closure 
was part of a systematic attempt to humiliate the fiji indian 
community and weaken its resolve to fight injustices that have been 
perpetrated upon them 
in new delhi indian foreign minister kumar gujral said indias 
moral support for the prodemocracy group prompted the closure 
order from the militarydominated government which he called an 
illegal regime 
racial discrimination is on the retreat even in south 
africa gujral told parliament it cannot survive in fiji for 
long 
fiji has a population of 715000 people indians whose 
ancestors were brought in by the british as indentured sugar 
plantation laborers slightly outnumber ethnic melanesian fijians 
the former british colony which achieved independence in 1970 
was expelled from the commonwealth after it declared itself a 
republic in 1987 india has long said it would oppose any move by 
fiji for reentry because of what it describes as the governments 
policy of discrimination 
fiji is composed of about 320 islands most of them uninhabited

almost an interregnum period while waiting for israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to form a new government which he is 
expected to do in the next two weeks 
there is no firm decisionmaking government in place bush 
said 
on capitol hill democrats lawmakers lambasted the 
administrations middle east policy in particular they criticized

liberation organization has lived up to its commitment to renounce 
terrorism 
the united states has said it would break off its dialogue with 
the plo if there were violations of that commitment 
rep larry smith dfla a strong supporter of israel called 
the administrations report a pack of lies a sham and a 
fraud he added the bush administration has the worst middle 
east policy hed seen in 20 years 
john kelly the assistant secretary of state for the middle 
east defended the report we clearly disagree that the 
report is dishonest it is not

million arabs in the occupied territories from the israeli army 
most of the 710 palestinians killed in the 29monthold uprising

airport scarcely took notice of the spraying 
i think people should accept it said longtime resident toni 
turner a retired case processor for the state attorneys office 
in a climate like this youre going to have insects and bugs and 
flies 
in california however aerial spraying against the medfly has 
angered residents and some scientists who are fed up with a 40 
million chemical war they say isnt working 
floridas joint statefederal medfly eradication effort is on a 
considerably smaller scale and opposition has been minimal to the 
fifth such campaign in a decade 
there are opponents however who say awareness of the dangers 
of malathion to people and the environment is growing and the 
sunshine state could learn something from california 
in this day and age when we have sprayed ourselves to death 
we really feel a chemical solution is abhorrent its

varieties of fruits and vegetables have been trapped since the 
first was found april 16 
the eradication program consists of weekly spraying over 16 
square miles which was to end in may but state officials recently 
announced that two more applications in a slightly expanded area 
would be needed after a fly was found north of the core treatment 
area 
the spraying will be followed by the release of millions of 
sterile male flies to break the breeding cycle 
state officials insist the program is both safe and effective 
i can assure you this if we felt there was any hazard to the 
population we wouldnt be doing what were doing said richard 
clark director of the states medfly eradication project 
clark said spraying first was necessary while labs produced 
enough quality sterile flies which takes about a month the 
availability of large quantities of radiated flies on short notice 
has been a source of concern in florida and california 
because of frequent fly trappings in the past decade and the 
publics increasing concern about malathion clark said more effort 
and thought will go into keeping the laboratories prepared 
clark said studies in california have shown no adverse health 
effects from the spraying furthermore florida has reduced the 
average number of pesticide applications needed by half since 1985 
when sterile flies were introduced in the program he said before 
then it took eight or nine treatments 
julia morton an economic botanist at the university of miami 
recalls a massive spraying undertaken in 1956 to battle one of the 
states worst medfly outbreaks and she is convinced that malathion 
is not harmful 
it is not only acceptable she said but obligatory 
the public in south florida has cooperated with agriculture 
officials unlike in california morton said the people in 
california should have checked their facts before they started 
screaming about malathion 
barneskelley and the washingtonbased national coalition 
against the misuse of pesticides dont believe that spraying 
malathion is harmless 
its a nervoussystem poison and its not something to be 
taken lightly said catherine karr staff toxicologist for the 
coalition 
i think what were really concerned about is theyre telling 
us its a very low risk we dont buy that barneskelley said 
opponents are worried that an insecticide that can ruin the 
paint on cars if not rinsed off promptly and can harm small animals 
can also hurt humans but floridians have not expressed widespread 
opposition to the medfly project apparently because it has 
affected relatively few people compared with california 
in southern california aerial assaults which the state 
recently announced would continue in san bernardino and riverside 
because of new fly finds remain highly controversial more than 
500 square miles have been treated since last summer with mixed 
success 
several california cities in efforts to seek a temporary 
injunction to stop the spraying have raised concerns over 
environmental damage and threats to endangered and threatened 
species in riverside county the state agreed to stop aerial 
spraying in areas where the endangered stephens kangaroo rat 
lives although ground spraying was allowed 
the area being affected in south florida parts of miami 
springs hialeah virginia gardens and unincorporated dade county 
is mostly residential with commercial corridors 
barneskelley said various environmental groups in south florida 
have discussed antimalathion strategies but no legal action has 
been planned interest in the issue is limited because only a 
relatively small area of dade county is affected she said 
malathion is a general insecticide that also kills other 
insects such as honeybees and butterflies said tom pliske an 
entomologist at florida international university in miami 
morton contends the poisonlaced bait is strictly for medflies 
and does not wipe out other insects it also disappears quickly and 
has no cumulative effect she said 
besides she noted florida already sprays to control mosquitoes 
florida in fact dispenses more than 60000 gallons of 
malathion annually for controlling mosquitoes the concentration is 
also higher slightly more than 3 ounces per acre for mosquitoes 
compared with 24 ounces per acre diluted with protein bait for 
medflies california also sprays yearround for mosquitoes in a 
program that has not been opposed by environmental activists

q so mr president are we going to see then your 
administration and your people on the hill pushing to get that 
provision back in a law 
a consider this a strong pitch for it right now right here on 
the end 
q mr president what happened to your promise to balance the 
budget without raising taxes are we going to make it 
a are we going to make the promise light laughter things 
are complicated out there on this subject and we are trying very 
hard to get a budget agreement and thats the way it is and well 
see how we go and ive reported i think that weve started off 
now in a bipartisan nature doing a good job i wish we could 
control the spending side better we refer you once again i dont 
want to ruin the last minute getting nicaraguapanama passed but i 
sent it up there at 800 million and its now 2plus billion but 
well keep plugging away and id like everybody to do it exactly 
the way i proposed i am now enough of a realist to realize that it 
might not be done exactly that now heres my problem i have a 
1000 meeting with the leader of haiti and weve got some problems 
there that we are helping trying to help to resolve so i can 
take two more one two 
q follow on that question 
q all right yes mr president id like to ask about the news 
report coming out of in the aftermath of the moscow meetings 
between with secretary baker that you were not as pleased with 
the outcome of those talks especially pertaining to start as 
secretary baker was 
a there is no light between us on that at all the 
administration has a united unified position it is a sound 
position theres no point just before you sit down to say they 
caved they gave more than we did but i am very satisfied with 
what where we stand all i want to do is be sure we can move 
forward and get get these deals finalized and we may not be able 
to do that but it doesnt help for me to go out and say who gave 
the most who knuckled under who took the most heat too much 
pressure i support what jim baker reported to me was where we 
stand at this juncture in negotiation ill tell you what troubles 
me is that were not somebody asked the question here were not 
further along on conventional forces but the strategic arms talks 
are going very well we still havent got a firm deal as you know 
but to get back to your with a chuckle to get back to your 
question there isnt any daylight between the white house and the 
state department or the arms control community or defense the 
proposals that jim baker is talking about have the strong support 
of the joint chiefs and of the secretary of defense so this is 
very encouraging that the administration is united now were going 
to have some criticism any time you make a deal you have 
editiorials out there telling you exactly how it should be done 
but i am confident that were on the right track follow up and 
then we go over for one more to frank 
q inaudible that your concerned about the stall in the 
conventional force talks and some people are saying that 
conventional forces is now the real litmus test of soviet 
intentions given the developments in eastern europe if they dont 
pull those troops back out of eastern europe then that tells you 
something about their ultimate intentions how do you 
a id say well i think that i think that thats a good 
point and one that i expect the soviets would want to dispel 
through action because i dont get the feeling that they are 
opposed to cfe agreements i do think for complicated reasons 
involving eastern europe that this the talks havent gone as far 
or as fast as i would like to see them but read carefully what 
shevardnadze and genscher allegedly talked about yesterday and 
genscher will be here talking about that and maybe we can find 
some way at the summit or before the summit to move cfe forward 
its important and i think it does send a bad signal if the 
soviets look like theyre refusing to go forward and dont want to 
say pull forces out of countries in accordance with previous 
deals yeah last one 
q mr president a few weeks ago in answer to a question about 
statehood for dc you suggested that voting representation might 
be a better alternative and you would consider it what 
consideration have you given it and what would 
a none so far and im opposed to statehood for the district 
q could you please explore the representation question what 
did you have in mind when you talked about that 
a about what 
q about voting representation rather than 
a hadnt really got it in mind interested in talking about it 
have done nothing about it at all except to continually restate my 
opposition because this is a federal city to statehood for the 
district 
q so the statehood bill now pending would be vetoed 
a well i havent even see the legislation i dont whether 
senate and house have agreed on a bill but i think my position is 
very clear and im not going to sign a statehood bill so i dont 
want to be under any false colors on this ive said that over the 
years and i have not changed my position thank you 
q could i follow up on that 
a thats a followup on a followup now come on ive got to 
go see the president of haiti 
q yes sir you had premised your opposition to statehood the 
last time on the inordinate share of federal funds that went into 
the local budget and i think thats a thing that has been 
clarified since then could you just tell us why youre 
a marlin had to clean up what i said 
q right could you tell us why youre opposed to statehood 
since that is not a factor 
a because its a federal city thats it thank you

israel will not allow un observers into the 
occupied territories to safeguard the palestinian population even 
if the un security council approves the proposal foreign 
minister moshe arens said today 
also today a 15yearold palestinian died afer being shot by 
soldiers in an overnight clash and the army lifted curfews in the 
west bank that had confined about a million palestinians to their 
homes since sunday 
refugee camps and towns in the gaza strip remained under 
stayathome orders except for three small villages the curfews 
were to quell rioting that began sunday when an apparently deranged 
israeli shot and killed seven arabs 
palestinians have requested un observers to protect the 17 
million arabs in the occupied territories from the israeli army 
most of the 710 palestinians killed in the 29monthold uprising 
have been slain by army gunfire 
plo chairman yasser arafat is expected to propose the observer 
force to a friday session of the 15nation council in geneva us 
secretary of state james a baker iii has said the united states is 
prepared to discuss the issue 
but arens said today he hoped the security council would not 
approve the force i hope that this is not going to take place 
he said 
if it does he said israel would not accept un observers on 
territory under israeli control 
israeli officials say israel is legally responsible for 
administering the territory seized in war and that foreign 
observers are already present in the form of un relief staff red 
cross officials foreign aid workers and journalists 
we feel there is no justification for the stationing of un 
observers in areas that are legitimately under israeli control and 
came under israeli control as a result of arab aggression in 
1967 arens said 
arens said israel was counting on the united states to veto the 
un resolution he said it was crucial that israel get a chance to 
explain that a veto was of the utmost importance 
but bakers surprise statement wednesday was taken as a further 
sign of israels deteriorating relations with the united states 
arens conceded coordination with the bush administration recently 
had not been as a close as it had been in the past 
but the foreign minister said he expected the situation to 
improve once prime minister yitzhak shamir forms a new government 
which he is expected to do in the next two weeks 
labor leader shimon peres also rejected the idea of observers 
but blamed shamir for plummeting relations with the united states 
the question is not one act or another by the united states 
the question is the deterioration in relations between us and the 
united states that is getting stronger he said on israel radio 
the masscirculation yediot ahronot newspaper quoted 
unidentified senior ministers in likud shamirs party as saying 
president bush was conducting a personal vendetta against shamir 
also today bernard kouchner a french government minister 
responsible for humanitarian aid visited the gaza strip israel 
radio said a soviet delegation was also en route to inspect the 
occupied areas after the recent bloodshed 
gaza looks like a city of ghosts where women walk around with 
babies in their arms in order to buy food israel radio quoted 
kouchner as saying 
since the rioting began sunday 15 palestinians have been killed 
in clashes with the army or in confrontations with israeli 
civilians 
in washington president bush said he was deeply troubled by 
the escalation of violence in the israelioccupied territories 
im worried about it i am troubled about the loss of human 
life i think particularly of children in this kind of 
situation bush said 
in the west bank town of ramallah hospital officials said 
mohammed samir salha 15 died today after being admitted with 
plastic bullet wounds in the head and chest he was shot during an 
army raid on the village of kibiya 
on wednesday night an 8yearold palestinian mustafa awad el 
fajem was fatally shot in the head in the gaza village of bani

antistate activity in sending a colleague to communist north korea

agreement which was not voted on by the union membership 
yonhap the national news agency said violent antijapanese and 
antius protests occurred at more than a dozen schools in seoul 
kwangju and taegu involving a total of about 6000 militant 
students 
lets oppose roh taewoos trip which sells out our national

hundreds of sugar workers angrily 
shouted for justice as gravediggers slid fausto felix ramirezs 
simple wooden coffin into a shallow cementlined trench 
the sandinistas look at us like were garbage said juan 
maria gutierrez cano who worked with ramirez at the montelimar 
sugar farm and refinery 
the 17yearold ramirez an antisandinista sugar worker died 
tuesday in a clash with sandinistacontrolled police he was buried 
wednesday 
in death he became a martyr to the sugar workers and a symbol 
of the complex tensions that grip nicaragua a month after the end 
of 10 years of revolutionary sandinista government 
the workers trying to oust the sandinistaappointed director of 
the montelimar sugar complex said truckloads of demonstrators were 
ambushed tuesday by police who fired tear gas shot out tires 
killed ramirez and wounded four other workers 
when they fired the tear gas i just ran said worker marco 
torres 
an official of president violeta barrios de chamorros 
government said police had disobeyed orders to avoid violence 
police officers refused comment wednesday evening when 
associated press reporters visited the district headquarters at san 
rafael del sur 
but a sandinista army lieutenant was angry enough to talk even 
though he apparently wasnt supposed to 
these people have backward minds he said refusing to give 
his name 
he admitted police tried to stop the sugar workers from driving 
25 miles north to the capital of managua for a demonstration he 
said workers threw rocks and surrounded a police car before the 
shooting started 
the labor trouble began only five days after mrs chamorro took 
office april 25 when most of the 2200 workers abandoned the 
sandinista union and joined the prochamorro nicaraguan workers 
union 
the administrators led by director jose leon roman fired 
prochamorro workers the workers said they docked workers a days 
pay for holding union meetings even though the meetings occurred 
at night after a full days work in the fields 
the accusations from workers at ramirez funeral became fierce 
roman didnt improve sanitation the clinic was poor food was bad 
he wouldnt take down the sandinista campaign posters even 
after daniel ortega lost said nicolas gutierrez the 
administration building was painted with a wallsize slogan with 
daniel as president jose leon roman 
one worker said the sandinistas were womanizers spending their 
time at the beach resort they bought cattle with the cafeteria 
money and sold it at a profit said another they bought fine 
whiskey the best soft drinks paid for dance bands with company 
funds said another 
these are false charges inventions to get everybody 
excited said the sandinista lieutenant the director is an 
honest man 
in the last 15 days the lieutenant said workers have 
threatened administrators spit at soldiers and yelled epithets and 
insults at the military post that guards the road to the refinery 
the workers said they were intimidated because administrators 
sandinista union officials and soldiers all carried ak47s the 
sovietdesigned assault rifle 
but most of the workers the lieutenant said carry machetes 
used to cut sugar cane 
no machetes were seen at ramirezs funeral 
the sugar refinery at montelimar is itself a symbol it is only 
a mile from the pacific coast a mile from nicaraguas finest beach 
resort and once belonged to dictator anastasio somozas family 
the sandinistas nationalized it promptly when they took power in 
1979 but sandinismo was never popular workers said 
the administration and sandinista buildings were closed 
wednesday residents of the small town around the refinery said 
none of the 50odd administrators and sandinista union officials 
had been seen since tuesday night 
a 15foothigh yellow tractor with blown tires was parked at one 
entrance and several 26wheel cane trucks with shotout tires sat 
two miles up the road where the clash occurred 
twentyfive policemen have been restricted to quarters while the 
investigation proceeds the workers say theyve been promised roman 
will be replaced 
at the cemetery in san bartolo the workers mourned ramirez 
although he hadnt worked at the refinery for long 
he didnt participate in anything said gutierrez cano who 
after 37 years earns 185000 cordobas or about 77 cents a day as 
a tractor operator 
ordinary workers earn 105000 cordobas or about 44 cents a 
day but that did not seem to be a major concern 
its the sandinista aggression against the workers they 
threatened us and theyd do things we didnt like and say they 
were doing them in our name said octavio acevedo villareal one 
of the opposition union organizers 
these people are really arbitrary said the sandinista 
lieutenant interviewed a halfhour later even the devil doesnt 
scare us we will defend ourselves

plastic trash is continuing to litter beaches 
and choke wildlife because boaters ignore laws that forbid dumping 
garbage overboard the center for marine conservation said thursday 
some people are annoyed by the trash some are surprised and 
most dont seem to care center spokeswoman kathy ohara said at 
a news conference where the floor was littered with plastic 
bottles cups and bags similar to the type of trash collected 
during the groups second annual national beach cleanup 
weve got trash on our beaches and its time to acknowledge it 
and clean it up she said 
the center said the gulf of mexico the pacific northwest and 
the chesapeake bay suffered the most from offshore generated waste 
because of the large volume of commercial and recreational boating 
in those waters 
twothirds of the trash picked up by the centers 65000 
volunteers was plastic eating utensils lids cups and tampon 
applicators at one beach in in kahoolawe hawaii 6 tons of debris 
was removed 
plastic trash not only lasts longer it kills wildlife 
ohara said 
during the clean up workers found a whale tangled in plastic 
fishing line and a brown pelican that had hanged itself from 
plastic wire caught in a tree ohara said 
spokeswoman lisa younger said cruise ships were the worst 
offenders of dumping trash overboard especially off the florida 
coast en route to the caribbean 
in addition waste from commercial ship galleys and from 
recreational boats is clogging beaches around the us coastline 
she said 
sailors have been taught for decades that trash is dumped 
overboard ohara said but were trying to teach them that 
plastics unlike paper and food dont just sink to the bottom and 
disappear 
sailors she said have been ore responsive when they hear the 
effect the plastics have on marine life 
annex v of the international convention for the prevention of 
pollution from ships known as the marpol treaty forbids atsea 
dumping of plastic materials and regulates the distance from shore 
that all other solid waste materials may be dumped 
but ohara said the coast guard which polices the waterways 
doesnt have the money or time to enforce the treaty efficiently 
the coast guard she said is investigating complaints about 
cruise lines if the lines are found guilty they could be fined 
25000 for each violation 
ohara said new degradable plastics were not a solution because 
they simply break down into smaller pieces which can still be 
ingested by fish and birds and can poison them

on wednesday lithuanias legislature offered to shelve some 
laws promoting independence but not the declaration itself in 
an effort to draw the kremlin into negotiations 
but soviet prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov said today that the 
lithuanian offer was not sufficient to bring kremlin leaders to the 
negotiating table he told reporters lithuania must suspend the 
declaration itself before talks can begin 
he said he was not fully familiar with lithuanias resolution 
but if there was no mention of the independence declaration 
then there is no basis for further discussion 
i think that they have not made a single step forward and have 
not withdrawn from their position ryzhkov told the unofficial 
interfax news agency 
lithuanias resolution adopted by a vote of 7415 with 10 
abstentions did not spell out which laws might be suspended 
soviet officials have objected to measures passed by the 
secessionist parliament to create a system of special 
identification cards for lithuanian citizens bar soviet army draft 
boards in lithuania and establish lithuanian control over its 
borders 
the resolution said the republic was prepared to temporarily 
suspend for the period of official interstate negotiations those 
actions and decisions arising from realization of the march 11 
1990 acts of the supreme council of the republic of lithuania 
related to interests that could be defined by both parties as 
objects of negotiations 
the lithuanian supreme council or legislature met for half a 
day today and a parliamentary spokesman said ryzhkovs rejection 
of the resolution was not discussed 
gorbachev has insisted lithuania and its sister republics 
latvia and estonia retreat from independence latvia and estonia 
have made more cautious moves toward independence 
baltic leaders have said they are willing to compromise but 
will not surrender their goal of seceding from the soviet union 
which forcibly annexed the three republics in 1940 
gorbachev has responded to lithuanias independence drive by 
cutting off oil natural gas and key raw materials since energy 
supplies were cut off on april 18 industrial production has 
dropped sharply traffic has thinned and 19000 people have been 
thrown out of work 
the gasoline shortage might force lithuanian authorities to stop 
all but emergency transport driving another 28000 people into 
unemployment officials said wednesday 
the lithuanian ministry of energy today halted the sale of 
gasoline to individual car owners limiting fuel supplies to 
emergency vehicles food trucks and transport elta said 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis in an appeal adopted 
by the supreme council said soviet sanctions openly undermine 
social guarantees of fulfillment of civil rights and legitimate 
citizens interests are destroying the economy of the republic of 
lithuania and are creating mass unemployment 
the appeal urged the nations of the world to exert pressure on 
the soviet union so that it will discontinue its inhumane action 
against the inhabitants of the republic of lithuania that violate 
norms of international law

the senate responding to a supreme court 
decision a year ago voted today to forbid the use of the death 
penalty against mentally retarded individuals convicted of capital 
crimes 
just because the supreme court says we can do it doesnt mean 
we should sen joseph r biden jr ddel told colleagues 
debating an omnibus crime bill the court ruled last year that 
putting mentally retarded persons to death in capital cases is 
permissible 
the senate defeated 5938 an amendment that would have limited 
the death penalty protection for the mentally retarded to those who 
dont know the difference between right and wrong 
it acted as president bush called on congress to approve a 
good strong anticrime bill without the curbs on semiautomatic 
assault weapons that the senate upheld wednesday as part of their 
anticrime package 
critics of the senate bill said almost every defendant facing a 
death sentence would claim to be mentally retarded under the 
legislation sen orrin hatch rutah called it a soft 
liberal approach 
sen alan simpson rwyo told the senate that as a prosecutor 
he once became so frustrated with a heavylidded slackjawed 
murder suspect who claimed to have have mental problems that he 
declared you sick slob 
he said the suspect was later released and sliced his wife up 
into 83 sections these are people who are human only in the 
sense of anatomical essence and they are bums declared simpson 
bush told a news conference i sent a crime bill to the 
congress and would like to see it enacted as a law enforcement 
bill

the president said today he supports limitations on the number 
of rounds of ammunition that could be carried in semiautomatic 
weapon clips but restated his opposition to the ban on the 
manufacture and importation of nine semiautomatics 
lets get a good strong anticrime bill and then we can have a 
debate about what they want to do on automatic weapons issues 
said bush a longtime member of the national rifle association 
the automatic weapon part does not have my support and i wish 
the congress would stop adding matters of this nature 
several lawmakers said in the aftermath of wednesdays vote that 
the gun issue might not be fully settled 
weve known for a long time we were going to have to deal with 
antigun legislation and i dont regard todays vote as the final 
word minority leader bob dole rkan said wednesday 
the 5248 vote was a defeat for the national rifle association 
which had pushed hard to kill the restrictions 
the measure would ban the import of five foreignmade weapons 
and outlaw the manufacture of four other varieties in this country 
the bill would not bar possession or sale of the weapons 
senate critics of the bill said assault weapons are not 
functionally different from semiautomatic hunting rifles with their 
traditional brown wooden stocks 
they said the restrictions would lead to more stringent curbs on 
all weapons and that in any case criminals could easily get the 
weapons illegally hatch said they would cause the persecution of 
honest lawabiding citizens 
richard f gamble president of colts manufacturing co said 
wednesday in hartford conn the vote was a sad and dishonest 
effort to make the public think the politicians are actually doing 
something about crime 
but sen dennis deconcini dariz who two years ago won an nra 
legislator of the month award scoffed at claims that the 
weapons would be used for hunting 
there are too many bullet holes in blue suits deconcini 
said there are too many women weeping over coffins there are 
too many children without fathers its time to stop the carnage 
the plan would ban the import of

in japans clearest effort to grapple with its 
militaristic past emperor akihito and prime minister toshiki kaifu 
on thursday acknowledged the suffering that japanese colonial rule 
inflicted on koreans 
the apology come 45 years after a defeated japan relinquished 
its control of the korean peninsula the issue of acknowledging 
japans past exposed bitter memories in both countries prompting 
demonstrations and arson attacks 
in a palace banquet for visiting south korean president roh 
taewoo akihito went beyond a previous imperial statement and said 
he felt the deepest regret for the pain japans colonial rule 
caused the korean people earlier thursday kaifu expressed 
sincere remorse and honest apologies for japanese actions that 
inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the 
korean peninsula 
kaifus apology was the most clearcut ever by a japanese prime 
minister foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said a similar 
statement of remorse also was expected to be made by parliament 
where roh was to give an address friday 
for japan which normalized relations with south korea in 1965 
the statements marked a breakthrough in acknowledging the suffering 
it inflicted during its 19101945 rule of korea the lack of an 
explicit apology had been a major obstacle to improving the two 
neighbors relations 
roh replying to akihito said the dark period in 
japanesekorean relations had been short and it was time to put 
the unfortunate past truly behind us 
in south korea thousands of radical students burned japanese 
flags and fought with police thursday they shouted slogans that 
rohs trip to japan only the second by a south korean head of 
state was a sellout to national pride 
under colonial rule koreans had to study japanese in school and 
were taught to worship the japanese emperor koreans were drafted 
into the japanese army and into forced labor in japan hundreds of 
thousands died in wartime service to japan 
little of this is known in japan and the history is skimmed 
over in schools lately however japanese media have given crash 
courses in japankorea history with graphic photos and films of 
japanese atrocities 
before the trip kaifu had offered to make a strong statement 
but south koreans sought a personal apology from akihito because 
japans military adventures in the early part of this century often 
were made in the name of his father the late emperor hirohito 
the demands sparked a debate within japans government over 
whether a strong apology by the emperor would violate 
constitutional restraints on his political role 
in a carefully orchestrated compromise both governments seemed 
to hope that whatever was lacking in the akihito statement would be 
made up for by kaifu and the parliament 
akihito quoted the words hirohito used in 1984 during the state 
visit of rohs predecessor chun doohwan it is indeed 
regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a 
period in this century and i believe it should not be repeated 
again 
that statement the closest hirohito ever came to a public 
apology was strongly criticized in south korea as being too vague 
and for not saying who was to blame 
but akihito went on to say i think of the sufferings your 
people underwent during this unfortunate period which was brought 
about by my country and cannot but feel the deepest regret 
underscoring the importance of rohs visit the 150guest 
banquet was the largest at the palace since akihito assumed the 
throne after his fathers death akihito broke with tradition by 
welcoming roh outside the banquet hall as they entered the hall 
musicians played hand in hand theme song of the 1988 seoul 
olympics 
foreign minister choi hojung who accompanied roh to tokyo 
indicated that japans apology fell short of seouls expectations 
but said he believed japan did its best to receive president roh 
with courtesy 
extreme leftists vowed to disrupt the visit which they call the 
first step toward reviving the militarist japanese empire 
rightists who worship the emperor have strongly opposed calls for 
akihito to apologize 
police mobilized 20000 officers to guard against radical 
attacks though they said about 300 leftist radicals demonstrated 
in two separate tokyo rallies no arrests or incidents were 
reported

with president bush and congress both 
reluctant to take the lead in budget talks a group of the nations 
mayors tried to show them the way thursday 
yes we need new revenues whether they are called user fees 
revenue enhancement or taxes said mayor kurt l schmoke of 
baltimore md a democrat 
schmoke and other members of the us conference of mayors 
conducted their own hearing in a senate hearing room into the tax 
and budget debate 
we are helping ourselves in baltimore to the maximum extent 
possible our property tax rate is double that of our neighboring 
counties said schmoke 
but baltimore and other urban areas cannot do the job alone 
we need a federal government that cares about our people and has 
the economic resources to help us it is a question of national 
leadership he said 
he said federal taxes should be raised and money diverted from 
defense spending to provide for the urgent needs of the nations 
poor 
the mayors tried to put a human face on deep urban problems with 
a series of witnesses who have been unable to find help 
valarie white of baltimore a 31yearold mother of five said 
she has been on a waiting list for public housing for eight years 
they live with her parents and other family members 11 people 
international agreements 
the taiwanese also refused to allow chinese dissidents aboard 
and said the ship would not be allowed to return for supplies after 
broadcasting 
organizers then announced plans to sail to japan in hopes of 
obtaining another transmitter but the tokyo government refused 
permission for the ship to dock because it was to be used for 
illegal broadcasts 
china repeatedly warned the regions governments not to assist 
the boat and refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
broadcasts 
although taiwans ruling nationalist party is the sworn enemy of 
the beijing government tensions between the two sides have eased 
in recent years and taiwan is anxious not to anger the beijing 
government

israelius relations have hit their lowest 
point since american anger over the 1982 invasion of lebanon held 
up fighter plane shipments to the jewish state 
the differences came into sharp focus thursday when israel 
rejected calls from the plo and arab nations to send un observers 
to the gaza strip and west bank to protect palestinians from 
israeli security forces on wednesday the united states said it 
would consider such proposals 
israelius relations have been tense since president bush 
publicly expressed his opposition to continued jewish settlements 
in the occupied territories israel also has refused to go along 
with an american peace strategy for the middle east 
then on sunday an israeli gunman killed seven unarmed arab 
laborers near tel aviv triggering a new wave of clashes between 
palestinian protesters and israeli troops fifteen palestinians 
have been killed and more than 800 injured since then 
both bush and the us state department have blamed the violence 
on the impasse in mideast peace efforts and urged israel to 
exercise restraint against palestinian demonstrators 
israeli officials contend sundays slayings were committed by a 
deranged man they feel washington has been trying to use the 
killings to prod the jewish state into making concessions to 
palestinians 
compounding their anger was secretary of state james a baker 
iiis statement wednesday that he would consider the idea of 
sending un observers to safeguard the 17 million palestinians 
living in the occupied territories 
the proposal is expected to be raised by plo chief yasser arafat 
before the un security council which meets friday in geneva 
israel condemns the plo as a terrorist organization 
israel has repeatedly rejected further un involvement in 
israeliheld areas it has accused the un relief and works 
agency which helps palestinian refugees of siding with the arabs 
in their conflict with israel 
foreign minister moshe arens said thursday that israel would not 
accept un observers even if the security council voted to send 
them saying the territories are legitimately under israeli 
control 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner said an 
observer corps in the areas israel has occupied since the 1967 
middle east war would be an infringement on our sovereignty and 
interference in our internal affairs 
pazner interviewed by telephone also took issue with the tone 
of washingtons condemnations of sundays killings 
if it would have been jews killed and not arabs would they 
say it was a result of the lack of a peace process pazner said 
a madman slaughtered innocent people but this has nothing to do 
with the peace process 
amid the conflict an israeli diplomat in washington yoram 
ettinger secretly cabled arens this week warning that israelus 
relations were at a low point the daily newspaper haaretz reported 
he noted increasing sympathy for the plo and displeasure with 
israels attempt last month to settle jews in the christian quarter 
of jerusalems walled old city the newspaper said 
but at a news conference thursday arens denied that israels 
strong ties with the united states were weakening 
there are disagreements even among the closest of partners 
and we certainly have some disagreements with the united states at 
the present time arens said but in my view i would not 
characterize the situation as deterioration 
in the past decade usisraeli relations have hit other low 
points the united states objected to israels invasion of lebanon 
in 1982 and was angered by a 1985 spy affair involving an american 
jew jonathan pollard a former navy analyst who gave secret files 
to israel 
shamirs political adviser yossi benaharon acknowledged the 
latest tension the facts are we are witnessing some problems in 
relations he said declining to go into details 
american tensions with israel over peace strategies date to 
shamirs refusal in march to accept bakers proposals for 
israelipalestinian talks in cairo egypt 
baker saw the planned dialogue as a step toward implementing 
israels plan for elections in the occupied areas but shamir 
demanded guarantees that the plo be excluded from any talks 
his coalition with the leftofcenter labor party fell apart in 
march because of likudlabor differences over agreeing to bakers 
plan 
israel also has taken issue with us opposition to settling 
soviet jewish immigrants in the occupied territories that conflict 
has persisted although israeli officials say that only about 200 
soviets have moved to the territories

the nations economy grew at a sluggish annual 
rate of 13 percent in the first quarter the government said 
thursday 
the growth was slower than first thought because of what 
analysts consider a healthy reduction in business inventories 
but while the commerce department report lowered the 
januarymarch growth rate it pumped up the inflation rate from 65 
percent to 67 percent the highest level since it reached 77 
percent in the fourth quarter of 1981 
while the inventory reduction was considered a possible sign of 
future growth the firstquarter gross national product was weaker 
than the original 21 percent estimate last month and only slightly 
improved from the fourth quarters 11 percent rate 
the growth rates in both quarters were the weakest since the 
economy grew at a 08 percent rate in the julyseptember period of 
1986 the gnp measures the nations total output of goods and 
services 
robert g dederick chief economist with the northern trust co 
in chicago acknowledged it was the second weak number in 
succession but said it offers the possibility of a quickening 
in the economy as businesses begin restocking their shelves and 
backlots 
allen sinai chief economist with the boston co described the 
inventory reduction as a healthy correction that combined with 
strong consumer demand could be setting the economy up for 
sustained growth provided that sales stay up 
if sales and demand stay up the economy will continue to 
expand closer to 2 percent this quarter he said 
sinai said there was no sign of any imminent recession in the 
report a recession usually is defined as two consecutive declines 
in the gnp 
dederick said the sluggishness in the economy was due to 
weakness in the manufacturing sector which probably is going to 
pick up some speed 
construction could well fade because that was bolstered in 
the first quarter by the good weather he said the real key 
will be whether we can get some push from the export side because 
it doesnt look as if the consumer has any independent strength 
doesnt look as if business spending is going up very much 
the bush administration initially forecast 24 percent growth 
this year and the new report spells more problems for 
administration and congressional budget negotiators as they resumed 
talks thursday on cutting the deficit 
if the slow near 1 percent growth of the last two quarters 
persists government revenues will be down 15 billion from 
projections in 1990 and will be down 45 billion in 1991 greatly 
adding to the budget and deficit problems said richard w rahn 
chief economist of us chamber of commerce 
the firstquarter gnp revision came after additional information 
was gathered showing a 85 billion downward revision in business 
inventories the department will publish its final reading on the 
firstquarter economy next month 
the price index tied to the gnp jumped from 36 percent in the 
fourth quarter to 67 percent from january through march 
about onehalf of the stepup was due to food and energy 
prices the department said large increases in january 
followed unusually cold weather in december that destroyed crops 
and depleted heating fuels 
the department also received additional information causing a 
99 billion upward revision in exports but it said that was 
offset by an upward revision of 9 billion in imports

the american civil liberties union is 
teaming up with tammy faye bakker in efforts to overturn a zoning 
ban against church services in a warehouse area 
warren keiner the aclus central florida chairman said there 
is no compelling reason to prohibit religious services in an 
industrial area where peace and quiet are not as important as they 
would be in a residential area 
mrs bakker and her husband jim set up their new covenant 
ministries in orlando last year before he began serving a 45year 
federal prison term in connection with fundraising activities in 
their former ptl television ministry 
it has been housed in a shopping mall a hotel a piano shop and 
lately in an industrial park 
after one sunday service orange county zoning officials said 
that while she could operate a broadcasting studio no church 
services would be permitted 
the aclu takes the position that churches can properly go into 
an industrialzoned area unless theres some overriding public 
reason to deny it said jerry bornstein an orlando lawyer acting 
as volunteer counsel for the aclu in mrs bakkers case 
mrs bakker who requested aclu help last week will challenge 
the zoning ruling at a hearing before the county in july 
churches are not permitted in industrial zones and there are 
zones that permit churches said assistant county attorney joel 
prinsell on wednesday 
we were under the impression that they were seeking a radio 
and television studio and offices at this particular location 
which is a permitted use prinsell said now they want a 
church which is not a permitted use 
aclu officials say the case centers on the first amendments 
protection of freedom of religion 
after discontinuing services mrs bakker said the ministry had 
decided the warehouse was an ideal place not only for its future 
broadcasting plans but for use as an assembly hall for supporters 
and worshipers

a strike by canadian truck drivers over 
proposed tax increases and the uscanadian freetrade agreement 
began disrupting production at auto plants in both nations as it 
entered its third day today 
canadian transport minister doug lewis flew today from ottawa to 
windsor to meet with protest leaders but when the sides emerged 
from a meeting to announce agreement angry truckers shouted them 
down 
they shouted they would continue the blockades until all the 
issues that led to the strike are resolved and they see a written 
agreement details of what the leaders agreed to were not announced 
the protest choked off shipments of parts to the general motors 
of canada ltd assembly plant in ste therese quebec where 3000 
workers worked half a shift before being sent home wednesday 
halfshifts were planned at the plant again today gm also sent 
home 11000 dayshift workers at three plants in oshawa ontario 
because of a lack of parts spokesman nick hall 
production also was disrupted at plants run by chrysler canada 
and ford of canada 
general motors corp ford motor co chrysler corp and honda 
of america manufacturing inc said production at their us plants 
could be curtailed if the protest continued much longer 
at fort erie ontario near niagara falls about 130 trucks 
jammed the approaches to the international peace bridge today as 
the protest spread to new york states borders 
the truckers blocked all commercial lanes of the bridge linking 
fort erie and buffalo ny to protest the free trade agreement 
with the united states and the goods and services tax that the 
canadian government plans to impose next year 
some american truckers have joined the protest either in 
sympathy with the canadians or because of grievances of their own 
more than 300 truckers parked their rigs wednesday along more 
than three miles of the highway leading to the ambassador bridge 
between windsor and detroit they remained there this morning 
parked in a line that led all the way to customs brokerage offices 
blocking only the truck lanes 
there also were about two dozen rigs on the bridge blocking 
truck traffic entering windsor from detroit 
hundreds more truckers blocked traffic on the blue water bridge 
between sarnia ontario and port huron mich according to oscar 
vazquez bridge safety officer for the us department of 
transportation 
quebec truck drivers on wednesday partially lifted a blockade 
that began monday but they continued to prevent us trucks from 
leaving or entering the province 
authorities at the bridges described the protests as peaceful 
and said cars were crossing without delays 
truckers at fort erie said competition from american drivers was 
making it impossible for them to stay in business 
the canadian truckers going to be extinct said randy 
blackmore of chatham ontario a spokesman for the truckers 
there wont be a canadian trucker five years from now 
the protest was over planned increases in canadian taxes on 
everything from the goods that truckers haul to the tires 
insurance and diesel fuel they buy 
the canadian drivers complain that us drivers have been able 
to undercut them because they arent paying nearly as much in 
taxes the uscanadian trade agreement which will remove almost 
all tariffs over a 10year period will further handicap canadian 
truckers they said 
we want the government to take some of these taxes off of 
us said hollie greer a trucker from harrow who parked his truck 
in the row of rigs along huron church street in windsor they are 
taxing us to death 
a fourhour meeting wednesday between protest leaders and 
ontario officials produced no agreement to end the blockade 
immediately but bill wrye ontario minister of transportation 
pledged to increase enforcement of regulations against us 
truckers within a few days

president bushs decision to renew chinas 
preferential trade status averts what many chinese and americans 
had predicted would be a death blow to the 11yearold relationship 
but even raising the issue as a way to punish china has 
undermined already crumbling ties and some us congressmen have 
said they will fight bushs decision compounding the mutual 
frustration and resentment 
chinese officials did not immediately comment on bushs 
announcement extending chinas mostfavorednation trade status for 
one year it came well after government offices closed thursday 
the only reaction came from the state xinhua news agency 
a small number of americans under the pretext of socalled 
human rights opposed the renewal of chinas mfn status the 
agency wrote their arguments have been strongly rejected by the 
majority of american people who cherish the longterm interests of 
relations between the two countries 
china had made clear that raising tariffs on its goods would 
lead not just to higher duties on us products and a sharp drop in 
trade but diminished political and cultural contacts as well 
china fought hard on the issue mixing veiled warnings with 
calls for washington to be sensible and consider the matter from 
a longterm perspective as communist party general secretary 
jiang zemin said recently 
china also made concessions to critics of its human rights 
record by lifting martial law in the tibetan capital and releasing 
211 people jailed for taking part in last years democracy movement 
in beijing 
bushs decision can thus be seen as a chinese diplomatic 
victory but a limited one 
chinas leaders still have failed to convince the white house or 
the us congress that how they treat political dissidents is an 
internal matter on which the united states has no right to comment 
in making his announcement bush said he was not condoning 
chinas suppression of dissent and urged chinese leaders to improve 
their human rights record 
many americans still believe chinas leaders should be punished 
in some way for having ordered the army to fire on unarmed 
prodemocracy protesters last june when hundreds and perhaps 
thousands were killed 
given such deep differences in outlook continued friction 
between beijing and washington is inevitable there will be no lack 
of new occasion for conflict 
for example the world bank is scheduled to consider several new 
loans to china next week although china insists such loans should 
not be linked to politics the united states has blocked past 
loans making exceptions only for those considered for humanitarian 
purposes 
fang lizhi chinas most famous dissident and his wife li 
shuxian remain in the us embassy in beijing a constant irritant 
in relations there appears no progress toward winning them safe 
passage from china jiang reiterated recently the couple must admit 
their guilt and promise not to fight the government again 
the more than 30000 chinese students in the united states will 
become a growing point of friction if as their studies finish 
significant numbers fail to return home bush has said those who 
were in the united states last june can stay at least until jan 1 
1994 if they fear persecution at home 
even with the extension of the special status bilateral trade 
and investment will be a source of controversy legislation 
affecting chinas textile exports is pending and some lawmakers 
have called for a ban on chinese products made by convicts 
in addition a serious slump in the chinese economy has kept 
many us investors away in the past year but china sees their 
absence as political and resents it

kelsey grammer of cheers was jailed 
thursday for a drunken driving probation violation 
the 35yearold actor who plays brainy psychiatrist frasier 
crane on the hit nbc series surrendered to the van nuys muncipal 
court and was taken immediately to county jail he showed up in 
court with a toothbrush stuck in his shirt pocket 
since his february 1988 conviction for drunken driving he has 
failed to make several court appearances to prove he completed a 
drug rehabilitation program 
municipal court commissioner patricia schwartz last week ordered 
grammer to serve a 30day sentence for failing to attend the 
program and failing to serve 10 days on a state road crew 
the commissioner also ordered grammer to show up in court 
thursday with proof he served at least one day of work on a 
california department of transportation road cleanup crew and 
enrolled in a 90day drug rehab program 
documentation presented by grammer on thursday established he 
had completed those obligations the court clerk said 
grammer still faces possible possession of cocaine charges 
in april 1988 police stopped his car for expired license tags 
and a routine check showed an arrest warrant had been issued for 
missing a court appearance while riding in the police car a 
packet of cocaine fell from his pocket officers said 
earlier this month grammer surrendered to authorities on arrest 
warrants involving both the drunken driving and cocaine arrests 
the incarceration shouldnt affect production of the show which 
is currently shut down between seasons

the state department said thursday it opposed 
a visa for plo leader yasser arafat to attend a un security 
council meeting in new york because it wanted to keep attention 
focused on the lack of middle east peace talks 
department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said a controversy 
over granting a visa to the palestine liberation organization 
chairman would have shifted the focus from the central issue of the 
absence of mideast negotiations 
the un session on the middle east which begins friday was 
shifted from new york to geneva to accommodate arafat he was 
denied a us visa two years ago on the ground he was an accessory 
to plo terrorism against americans and israelis 
this time the state department took a softer line in explaining 
why it was unenthusiastic about allowing arafat to come to new 
york 
we felt a major controversy over a visa would shift the focus 
from what is really the issue in the middle east the absence of a 
peace process ms tutwiler said she said that was the main 
reason the united states opposed arafats entry 
rather than risk being turned down arafat had approached the 
state department indirectly through un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar the department replied directly to the plo in 
tunis where arafat maintains his headquarters 
we made it clear we were unenthusiastic ms tutwiler said 
adding that the department had no objection to arafat speaking in 
geneva 
asked about the terrorism charges of 1988 ms tutwiler replied 
i cannot compare apples and oranges we are sitting here in 
1990 
in december 1988 a month after his previous visa request was 
denied arafat publicly renounced terrorism and said he recognized 
israels right to exist 
he took those steps at the urging of the state department which 
immediately opened talks with the plo 
the plo covenant still calls for the dismantling of the jewish 
state

under a new plan to relax response times in 
war natos combat planes will remain at full alert but some 
frontline troops will have twice as long to react to an attack 
the nato military commander said thursday 
us gen john r galvin the supreme allied commander in 
europe said the response times of air and ground forces in western 
europe could be eased even more with additional cuts in red army 
troops in eastern europe 
as more changes occur we will probably lengthen the time for 
saddling up and moving out galvin said during an interview at 
his official residence in mons about 40 miles southwest of 
brussels 
defense secretary dick cheney and other defense ministers of the 
north atlantic treaty organization announced wednesday the decision 
to lower the readiness and availability of a number of our 
standing forces 
they attributed the action to the diminished military threat 
from the sovietled warsaw pact and the increased warning time of a 
fullscale soviet attack 
the move is part of a series of measures likely to be taken in 
the coming months to revise the military strategy that guided the 
alliance in the cold war years 
galvin said he issued the order wednesday to put the new 
response schedules into effect july 1 
there are significant changes he said 
the time targets he said relate to opposing forces the 
soviets have pulled back some of their forces from eastern 
europe the warsaw pact is not the same by any means 
there is no use keeping as many people snugged right up close 
on response times unless its absolutely necessary he said 
with the changes in the east bloc its not quite as 
necessary 
but he cautioned the west could easily quicken response times if 
the eastwest situation deteriorated we can tighten them up 
again if we have to he said 
he said the precise schedules for the new response times were 
classified but that the reaction time for some ground forces will 
be doubled response time refers to the amount of time it takes a 
unit of soldiers or an air crew to get ready and react to an enemy 
attack 
certain things that were a matter of minutes i could change 
to hours and things that were hours i could change to several 
more hours and even to days he said 
all ground and most air forces including helicopters and 
surfacetoair missile units in europe will be affected by the 
changes he said 
there will be no easing of the reaction time for fullalert 
interceptor planes which have only a few minutes notice to be in 
the air to fend off an attack 
quickreaction aircraft are still on the same alert basis 
he said 
he predicted their status would remain unchanged even after a 
new review of the changing military situation in europe 
as long as we have forces we want some quickreaction 
capability that is right down to a matter of minutes to get 
airborne he said well under 100 planes he said are ready to 
do that 
he said it was easier for western forces to respond to a ground 
attack than an air assault air movement is very fast he said 
the changes he said could mean substantial cost savings over 
time 
he said it was expensive for instance to keep an antiaircraft 
missile crew with backup assistance at a high level of readiness 
galvin said nato guidelines give him the authority to relax the 
reaction times to a certain extent but additional reductions would 
require agreement of the member nations

president bush set off a new row with congress 
thursday by unconditionally renewing chinas mostfavorednation 
trade status for one year he said its too early to talk about 
giving the same trade benefits to moscow 
despite chinas continued repression of the prodemocracy 
movement bush said its emigration policies qualify it for the 
preferential trade treatment while the soviet unions does not 
i dont think this is a reward to beijing i think it is very 
important we keep these commercial contacts said bush who 
announced what he described as a difficult decision at a white 
house news conference 
the move which had been expected still caused an uproar in 
congress from members of both parties who consider the 
administrations china policy too accommodating to the current 
leaders in beijing 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash criticized bush for 
failing to put any conditions on the oneyear extension to prod 
china toward reforms 
i think he faces some very severe problems here foley said 
at the present time i would say there are not the votes to 
approve it 
and senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said bushs 
decision is inconsistent with american values 
mitchell said he would aggressively and vigorously try to 
block bushs action 
congress can do so only by enacting a resolution of 
disapproval and such a measure was quickly introduced in the 
house the resolution if passed could still be vetoed thus it 
would take twothirds majorities in both chambers to override 
bushs decision 
the president said his move is not a special favor to 
beijing it is the basis of everyday trade 
as for next weeks summit bush said enormous problems face 
him and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at the fourday 
washington meeting including the issue of german reunification 
the united states wants a unified germany to be a full member of 
nato the soviet union wants it to either be neutral or have 
membership in both nato and the warsaw pact 
on a more upbeat note the president said he hoped for 
significant progress at the may 31june 3 meeting on an 
agreement to cut longrange nuclear weapons and the nailing down of 
a pact eliminating chemical weapons 
he also voiced optimism that some progress would be made in 
resolving a stalemate over reducing troops and tanks in europe 
i dont want to have two ships pass in the night the soviet 
union and the united states and weve got a lot to talk about 
bush said 
bush also defended secretary of state james a baker iii against 
criticism from the political right that he had made too many 
concessions in presummit arms negotiations last weekend in moscow 
there is no light between us on that at all bush said it 
doesnt help for me to go out and say who gave the most who 
knuckled under who took the most heat he added 
bushs china trade decision came less than two weeks before the 
first anniversary of the bloody june 4 1989 tiananmen square 
crackdown 
as we mark the anniversary of tiananmen we must realize that 
by maintaining our involvement with china we will continue to 
promote the reforms for which the victims of tiananmen gave their 
lives bush said 
mostfavorednation status gives china the same preferential 
trade treatment including lowestpossible tariffs that is 
extended to most major trading partners china has had the status 
for 10 years 
denial would send tariffs rising sharply on some 12 billion in 
annual imports from china of textiles toys and other products 
the american association of exporters and importers has 
estimated that removal of mfn status would have boosted tariffs on 
chinese goods an average 40 percent the president said these costs 
would be passed on to us consumers 
bush also said he did not wish to hurt the freemarket economy 
of hong kong some 85 billion in chinamade products each year 
are reexported by hong kong to the united states 
he said removing mostfavorednation status also could endanger 
the 6 billion in us goods that china buys each year including 
aircraft wheat and chemicals 
while continuing the trade benefits to china bush said that it 
was premature to discuss bestowing them on the soviet union under 
a 1974 law moscow has been denied the benefits because of 
repressive policies toward the emigration of soviet jews and other 
minorities 
mfn is based on emigration and emigration has continued from 
china at respectable levels bush said 
moscow is considering such legislation but a vote wont be held 
until after the superpower summit 
bush also said there was a political climate in the united 
states that would make it extraordinarily difficult to grant 
mostfavorednation status to the soviets at this time 
particularly in light of the impasse over lithuania and other 
baltic republics 
the standoff between the kremlin and the rebellious baltic 
states continues to cast a cloud over the upcoming summit bush 
said i cant tell you im encouraged about where it stands right 
now he said 
on other issues bush 
called for restraint by israeli soldiers involved in clashes 
with palestinians saying he was troubled about the loss of human 
life 
pledged to work with congress to protect depositors whose 
money is held in savings and loan institutions that go into 
default administration officials estimate the government may have 
to borrow up 130 billion or more 
said he was pleased with the results so far of deficitcutting 
talks with congress but declined anew to say whether new taxes 
might be required he voiced unexpected praise for house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo a frequent critic for doing a good 
job in leading the budget talks 
urged congress to pass a good strong anticrime bill 
but without curbs on semiautomatic weapons that were narrowly 
approved in the senate on wednesday

ivan f boeskys credibility as prosecution star 
witness in a securities fraud trial took another blistering assault 
today from a defense lawyer seeking to portray him as a 
moneygrubber who might have cheated on his taxes 
separately it was disclosed that boesky took a 50 million tax 
deduction in 1986 accounting for half of the 100 million he paid 
the government to settle its criminal insider trading case against 
him 
boesky on the stand for a third day in the trial of former 
friend john a mulheren jr seemed more comfortable facing the 
aggressive questioning of defense attorney thomas p puccio after 
reacting with testy indignation to wednesdays crossexamination 
the trial is the first time boesky wall streets most famous 
felon has testified publicly about his own crimes and the alleged 
offenses of others he has implicated in a web of financial market 
corruption in the 1980s 
puccio unsuccessfully sought to make boesky admit that he was 
terrified of losing his fortune and had transferred vast amounts of 
money under his wifes name before he settled charges with the 
government 
boesky who surrendered 100 million in penalties and fines 
faces numerous civil lawsuits and spent two years in a federal 
prison long has claimed his legal ordeal has nearly bankrupted him 
youre the kind of man who was concerned about how much money 
you had or didnt have puccio asked boesky replied less 
than you might think it has far less far less consequence than 
you might think 
puccio also asked us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum 
for permission to see boeskys 1987 federal tax return saying he 
wanted to determine if boesky took an illegal deduction on the 100 
million 
at a later conference with attorneys in the judges chambers 
boesky attorney charles davidow said boesky had deducted 50 
million of his 100 million penalty on his 1986 personal income tax 
statement davidow said he did not know whether the deduction was 
legal but he assumed boeskys tax attorneys or accountants had 
reviewed it at the time 
the judge granted puccios request however she said she would 
allow defense attorneys to discuss the deduction during 
crossexamination only in attempting to show that the penalty 
against boesky was not as painful or expensive as it appeared 
on wednesday boesky admitted under a heated crossexamination 
that he had lied under oath repeatedly in the past 
i regret that i lied i did not like lying at the time nor 
did i like the time when i represented false statements about your 
client boesky told puccio 
mulheren faces 41 counts of securities fraud and other charges 
for allegedly helping boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federal 
securities laws 
boesky fingered mulheren in a 1986 plea bargain under which he 
paid 100 million in penalties and served two years of a threeyear 
prison sentence to settle the largest insider trading case ever

most west germans favor slowing down 
german unification and do not want joint german elections this 
year according to a poll published thursday 
and law enforcement officials said in reports published thursday 
the price of german unity might be an outbreak of terrorism in east 
germany by west german terrorists who oppose the spread of 
capitalism 
the survey in the news magazine stern also said an overwhelming 
majority 77 percent of those questioned said the terms of full 
unification should be decided in an allgerman referendum not by 
the two german parliaments 
the results indicated clear disagreement with chancellor helmut 
kohls reunification ideas kohl supports quick reunification has 
expressed support for joint elections this year and wants the 
parliaments to decide on unity 
stern did not say how many people it queried or give a margin of 
error for the poll 
it said 60 percent of west germans think unification is 
occurring too quickly and 65 percent believe this year is too 
early for allgerman elections 
it is still unclear when a full political union will occur 
although the economies of west and east germany are to become one 
july 2 
most west germans support unification as do their eastern 
neighbors but many have grown nervous about kohls rush to unite 
the states they worry that hasty unification will jeopardize their 
hardearned affluence since east germany will be heavily reliant 
on west german financial aid 
law enforcement officials told two bonn newspapers that east 
german politicians and west german businessmen could become targets

the owner of a seized soviet fishing 
vessel has agreed to pay 325000 to settle a forfeiture case 
alleging illegal fishing the us attorneys office said 
the incident april 26 was at least the second time since 1989 
that a soviet fishing vessel was seized and fined for fishing in 
north pacific waters designated as an exclusive us zone 
fines are levied based on the nature and gravity of the charge 
as well as whether the vessel is a repeat offender assistant us 
attorney tim burgess said wednesday 
considering those factors burgess said the soviet fine was 
average 
the factory trawler ilya ilyin owned by a soviet fishing 
cooperative was seized after the coast guard observed the ship 
with its nets in the water within the us fishing zone northwest 
of the pribilof islands 
the vessel led the coast guard cutter yocona on a chase before 
stopping in international waters where it was boarded authorities 
said 
the ship was escorted to kodiak island its 84 crew members 
remained aboard the vessel while it was in us possession it was 
released friday 
anchorage attorney michael white who represented the ships 
owner said it agreed to the fine but maintains the illegal fishing 
was inadvertent white said the vessel was just 1000 yards within 
the us zone 
the fine is payable to the us treasury within 60 days which 
white said was manageable even though banks may not make loans to 
the soviets and the soviet ruble is not a convertible currency 
the soviets made a 75000 down payment toward the fine by 
applying funds left over from an earlier fine levied against a 
soviet vessel seized last year for illegal fishing white said 
foreign and us fleets have clashed for years over the 
lucrative northern pacific fisheries in recent years the 
government has seized vessels from canada taiwan and japan but 
soviet vessels are more rare 
us authority stems from the 1976 magnuson act which 
established the nations 200mile exclusive economic zone

the sovietled warsaw pact is dead as a military 
alliance and will probably fall apart when east germany leaves it 
the international institute for strategic studies said thursday 
the wests main dilemma in the 1990s will be how far to get 
involved in the messy aftermath the london research center 
said in its annual strategic survey released thursday 
even without a clear threat from the east the 16nation nato 
alliance could serve as an insurance policy for a future 
undivided europe but its role needs a complete redefinition the 
survey said 
in early 1989 the key question had been whither nato 
it said a year later that question remains valid but a 
second question whether nato lies not far below the surface 
the survey said the soviet union appears to be sliding toward 
chaos and how long and how much of it will remain together are 
very much open questions 
at a news conference iiss director francois heisbourg said 
there was no possibility the sevennation warsaw pact could act 
as a single organization in warlike circumstances where it was 
the aggressor 
but nato as an insurance policy is indispensable to the extent 
that the countries of western europe and the united states consider 
they have in common a number of interests alongside a number of 
values said heisbourg 
in the past year most of the soviet unions erstwhile allies in 
eastern europe have overthrown communist governments and 
czechoslovakia and hungary are pressing soviet troops to get out 
fast 
heisbourg suggested that western countries could subsidize the 
return of more than 500000 soviet troops stationed outside the 
soviet union 
the largest soviet deployment 380000 soldiers is in east 
germany 
he said it would take at least two years to withdraw soviet 
troops from east germany if a crash housing program started now for 
the returning soldiers 
how western states marry their desire to see progress in 
eastern europe with an equally potent concern not to get entangled 
in the messy aftermath of soviet decolonization in europe will be 
one of the principle dilemmas of the 1990s said the survey 
heisbourg said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was still 
trying both to keep up reforms and to stop the secession of 
republics such as lithuania but would soon have to choose one 
policy or the other 
he predicted the soviet empire would fall apart but gave no 
timetable 
there is no example of a multinational empire grouped together 
in circumstances which are not considered legitimate by all the 
people surviving whether you are talking about the ottoman 
empire the austrohungarian empire or the soviet union he said 
on other regions the survey said 
middle east egypt has supplanted syria as the preeminent power 
in the arab world gaining status from attempts to mediate peace 
between israel and the plo syria weakened its position by trying 
to achieve strategic party with israel in the 1990s it is 
egypts capacity to moderate and mediate between the arab states 
and outsiders as well as between the insecure arab governments 
themselves which will be put to the test 
south africa the reform process begun by president fw de 
klerk is irreversible and both black and white leaders are 
under pressure to compromise to reach a quick agreement it is a 
highrisk venture which could easily be derailed by radical 
elements in both black and white ranks 
east asia north koreas military preparations belie the 
claim that it no longer represents a threat to the south there 
are reports north korea is stocking up on chemical weapons and 
building a nuclear weapon 
afghanistan a military stalemate between president 
najibullahs prosoviet administration and moslem guerrillas offers 
no prospect of a settlement the alternative a revision to a 
loosely linked agglomeration of semifeudal fiefdoms with no writ 
running countrywide appears no less possible and might be as 
durable 
nicaragua and cuba the sandinista governments acceptance of 
electoral defeat in nicaragua is an encouraging sign but huge 
problems remain throughout the region despite communist president 
fidel castros bluster doubts are growing about the cuban 
leaders ability to stay in power

alyeska pipeline service co plans to 
nearly triple its work force this summer and spend an extra 230 
million repairing pipeline corrosion and preventing oilspill 
damage company officials say 
this is our busiest summer since construction of the 
pipeline alyeska spokeswoman marnie isaacs said wednesday the 
company runs the transalaska pipeline for the seven major oil 
companies that own it 
about 150 million of alyeskas 450 million field budget this 
year will be spent to repair or replace sections of corroded pipe 
in the 800mile line which provides onefourth of us oil 
production 
corrosion occurs most often in pipes that have little or no oil 
flowing through them allowing water to settle in the pipe and 
start rusting it alyeska officials said 
alyeska has found more than 800 anomalies where corrosion 
could have occurred in the pipeline engineering and projects vice 
president ivan henman said it has investigated and begun repairs 
on about half of those he said 
the company anticipates spending as much as 800 million to 
repair the corroded pipe over several years and officials 
predicted their budget would be even larger next year 
state officials have said the total repair bill could be 15 
billion 
oil spillrelated improvements will account for another 80 
million this year said henman onequarter of that on measures to 
protect fisheries in prince william sound 
theres a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done and 
its the responsible thing to do im encouraged that alyeskas 
doing it dan lawn of the state department of environmental 
conservation said from valdez 
on june 12 the entire pipeline will be shut down for 12 hours 
for intensive inspection and repairs alyeska expects to employ 
about 1700 people during that stint 
the 12hour shutdown will mean as many as 900000 barrels of oil 
wont be shipped according to state petroleum economist dudley 
platt 
in all he said the state expects about 25 million barrels of 
oil wont be shipped over a threemonth period this summer because 
of repairs by alyeska and by british petroleum and arco alaska inc

the opposition labor party which holds a 
commanding lead over prime minister margaret thatcher in opinion 
polls unveiled a new moderate platform thursday that marked the 
climax of a major policy shift 
the 20000word document incorporated most of mrs thatchers 
stringent curbs on labor unions envisaged private investment in 
state enterprises and imposed an income tax ceiling of 50 percent 
under the last labor party government in 1979 the top income tax 
was 83 percent 
on defense the socialist party promised large but unspecified 
cuts in spending and said money saved would be diverted to social 
programs the party had already ditched its votelosing policy of 
unilateral nuclear disarmament 
some of the people who have been socialists have been 
profoundly wrong said labor leader neil kinnock we are 
convinced democratic socialists 
until the mid1980s labor wanted to withdraw britain from the 
12nation european community it took a proeurope stance in the 
new platform 
the policy statement looking to the future said a labor 
government will negotiate british entry into the exchange rate 
mechanism of the european monetary system which links most 
currencies of the 12 ec nations 
the conservative party dismissed the policy document as a public 
relations exercise and said the reality of a labor government would 
be high taxes and unions out of control 
kinnock a 48yearold welshman has pushed labor toward the 
center particularly since the partys third successive election 
defeat by mrs thatcher in 1987 
the party lost power amid antiunion sentiment provoked by 
nationwide strikes and soaring prices it lurched to the left in 
the early 1980s when mrs thatcher set about her freemarket 
revolution 
but mrs thatcher is now in trouble over the economy inflation 
is heading toward 10 percent and there is an uproar over a new 
local tax system 
labor has led in opinion polls for more than a year sometimes 
by as much as 20 points and hammered the conservatives in local 
elections this month 
kinnock who will automatically become prime minister if labor 
wins national elections now regularly outstrips 64yearold mrs 
thatcher in personal popularity ratings 
the next election does not have to be held until mid1992 there 
is speculation however mrs thatcher may call one in march 1991 
if her policy of using high interest rates to squeeze inflation is 
working by then 
britain traditionally has short fourweek general election 
campaigns 
but both major parties have already started what amounts to 
election campaigning 
conservative party chairman kenneth baker on wednesday launched 
what he called a summer blitz on labor with electionstyle 
gimmicks its emblem is a spoof showing labors redrose emblem 
wilting 
they are ahead in the polls baker said of labor on thursday 
i cant just avert my eyes from this unseemly sight i must 
attack 
on union laws labor said it will ease restrictions on sympathy 
strikes but leave in place key curbs such as forcing secret 
ballots before strikes the socialist party receives financial 
support from the unions 
labor avoided putting a price on its program party leaders also 
would not say at what level higher tax rates will apply 
the conservatives say labor would increase taxes impose 
punitive tax rates on the wealthy and push up inflation trying to 
finance more state benefits 
since taking office mrs thatcher has slashed income tax to 
flat rates of 25 percent or 40 percent but the sales tax is 15 
percent on most items and labor argues the overall tax burden on 
the poorest has increased 
among other issues the new document dropped labor pledges to 
reverse with minimum compensation mrs thatchers sales of state 
enterprises ranging from british airways to the national telephone 
network 
the policy document pledged only to return to state ownership 
the latest sold utility the water supply network

those age 18 to 24 came in last 
alex trebek host of the longrunning television quiz show 
jeopardy moderated the finals using maps and slides to

the correct answer was the silk route other acceptable answers 
would have been the silk road jade road fur road or emperors 
road 
tim added to the suspense of the competition often responding 
after long pauses and asking trebek to repeat most of the questions 
ive learned not to take your quizzical uncertain look 
seriously tim trebek said at one point in the second 
tiebreaker round every time you appear that way you come up 
with the right response 
but susannah and tim they both missed that question the 
terrorist activities of members of the mau mau played an important

premier nikolai i ryzhkov warned his countrymen 
thursday of the painful processes needed to rescue their 
stagnant economy but he said there was no choice but to abandon 
central planning and adopt a market system 
ryzhkov himself owned up to the catastrophic state of the 
economy and faced a barrage of criticism that climaxed with demands 
for his government to resign his twohour address to the supreme 
soviet parliament was nationally televised 
he said there would be price hikes and unemployment possibly 
in the tens of millions but our decision is made we have to 
move to the market 
ryzhkov presented the program as a compromise between 
polishstyle shock therapy which tries to keep the transition 
to a market economy short by taking more radical measures 
immediately and appeals to return to the oldstyle centrally 
planned soviet economy 
his vehement rejection of the polish model led deputy vitold 
fokin to comment from the podium theyve ruled out shock 
therapy but now theyre recommending an operation without 
anesthesia 
immediately after ryzhkovs speech several dozen opposition 
lawmakers voted to demand a motion of noconfidence in his 
government 
the government is not proposing a market only a price hike 
said alexei levashov a lawmaker from leningrad 
galina starovoitova another deputy warned that the angry 
hungry populace might take to the streets when bread prices triple 
on july 1 the first step of the proposed reform bread is the 
staple of the soviet diet and is extremely cheap about 32 cents a 
loaf 
on the parliaments floor radical economist gennady filshin 
demanded the government resign because he said it had lost the 
peoples trust and therefore lacked the authority to carry out the 
needed reforms 
ryzhkov said the plan which provides financial aid to 
compensate consumers for most of the price rises would be 
presented for nationwide discussion he did not mention a 
formal referendum which other government officials have predicted 
ryzhkovs proposal brought objections to turn this into a 
poll or referendum is like asking me do you want me to give you 
an enema said deputy yuri chernichenko of course ill say 
no 
ryzhkov admitted the soviet people would find it very 
difficult to accept the proposal that has been put forward 
the governments task is to explain to convince people this 
is the road we have to take he told reporters 
the premier a tall former factory director whose voice 
sometimes trembles when he speaks in public dismissed the efforts 
to unseat him 
its a political game no more he said 
members of the opposition interregional deputies group which 
claims about 70 of the supreme soviets 542 deputies said they 
knew the noconfidence vote would fail and might not even have 
enough support to get onto the agenda but they said they believed 
they had to make the gesture 
it is not expected to come up for a vote until discussion of the 
government project is complete the discussion will continue friday 
ryzhkov told parliament the economic transition should be made 
in three stages starting jan 1 average food prices will double 
with meat prices rising 23 times and fish prices 25 times he 
said food prices now are heavily subsidized 
the first stage also would require parliament the council of 
ministers that ryzhkov heads and president mikhail s gorbachev to 
approve laws and decrees establishing a marketstyle credit and 
banking system 
ryzhkov promised that the government would compensate people 
especially lowincome families to help them survive price 
increases but he said there would be no compensation for luxuries 
such as jewelry liquor tobacco and delicacies 
he also promised to provide for the millions of people who could 
be thrown out of work by the reforms 
he told lawmakers the second stage of the plan during 1991 and 
1992 would involve price reform a new taxation system and bank 
interest rates far higher than the 2 percent now charged and paid 
by banks 
we need a really tough financing and credit policy that should 
become a tool for the government to regulate economic life and 
prevent inflation he said 
the second stage also calls for transferring 60 percent of state 
enterprise to jointstock ownership for eventual sale to private 
individuals and companies or to workers 
the third stage actual transfer of ownership and a sharp 
reduction of central control should occur in 199395 the period 
of demonopolizing the economy he said 
computer studies show that moving to a market economy will 
lead to a sharp drop in investment and the curtailment of 
production in heavy industries the state news agency tass 
reported that is expected to entail bankruptcy for inefficient 
factories and businesses

a widening wildcat strike by railroad 
workers cut off the nations busiest port thursday but the 
solidarityled government refused to grant pay raises demanded by 
the strikers 
it was the most serious challenge yet to polands economic shock 
program and government officials said giving in even once to 
workers demands could scuttle the reforms 
the government fired the communistappointed director of the 
pomerania rail region along the baltic coast just before opening 
negotiations with labor representatives the government refuses to 
talk directly with the strikers 
negotiations broke off after six hours because three of the 
unions insisted the talks be moved to slupsk where the renegade 
strike committee is based the official pap news agency said 
the unions do not represent the strikers but the government had 
invited a delegation from the strike committee to the warsaw talks 
the delegation never arrived and the strikers demanded the talks 
be moved 
government spokesman zbigniew augustynowicz said officials were 
unsure whether they would go to slupsk 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki appealed thursday for an end 
to the strike

crossing together the stormy river of economic change 
the labor unrest including hunger strikes by 50 workers has 
produced a full blockade of rail traffic in northwest poland 
cutting off the countrys busiest port in szczecin railroad 
spokesman jacek wnukowski said 
the fiveday strike spread to the rail station at the gydnia 
port near gdansk the official pap news agency said

repair shop were idled and traffic from the industrial south was 
disrupted the army was moving perishable goods and essential 
supplies

railroads 400000 employees were on strike 
in addition to seeking pay raises of about 8 above the national 
average of 79 monthly the strikers are seeking the dismissal of 
railroad directors installed by the former communist regime the 
contend the old guard is incompetent and hampering reforms 
solidaritys leadership has called the strike a strong 
warning that the government it helped create must speed reforms 
but the leadership urged the workers to resolve the strike 
leader lech walesa said the strikers anger is legitimate but 
their actions are too drastic when our democracy is young and 
weak he postponed his friday departure on an eightday trip to 
scandinavia because of the unrest 
the solidarity chapter repesenting gydnia port employees urged 
the strikers to return to their jobs saying their action is a 
way of blackmail and limits the possibilities for negotiations

to convince western investors that postcommunist poland is 
politically stable

nasa and the defense department announced 
thursday they have approved a unique plan by five aerospace 
companies to put aside rivalries and work on the national 
aerospace plane as a team 
the aerospace plane to be known as the x30 will be a research 
vehicle capable of flying up to 25 times the speed of sound it is 
to be built primarily to develop technologies that will be used on 
planes of the future 
a priority goal for the x30 is to fly directly into orbit from 
a conventional runway and return unlike the space shuttle which 
requires a booster rocket and an expendable fuel tank for 
launching it is also to be capable of long range hypersonic travel 
within the atmosphere 
the five contractors had agreed in january to end competition 
for developing the plane and modify their fixedprice contracts 
with the government to reflect the team concept the announcement 
thursday was the governments acceptance of the plan 
the five companies are general dynamics mcdonnell douglas 
rockwell international rockwells rocketdyne division and pratt amp 
whitney they are to be known as the national contractor team 
the federal government is taking a unique step in bringing 
together a single team of experts to examine the technical 
applications of hypersonic flight said the joint announcement by 
nasa and dod 
antitrust issues raised by the teaming are not expected to be a 
problem since the x30 is not a commercial product and not for 
profit 
the benefits of teaming include eliminating duplication of 
efforts said jr thompson deputy administrator of nasa in 
congressional testimony earlier this year 
the contractors are able to remain open to the benefits of 
technology spinoffs and still be genuine competitors on future 
naspderived concepts nasp is probably the ideal program for such 
a bold contractual approach because of the challenge of the vehicle 
and the fact that each contractor has excellent ideas concepts and 
expertise 
in their agreement in january the five contractors designated 
rockwell international as the lead contractor and said barry j 
waldman formerly vice president and program manager of 
rocketdynes nasp efforts as program director 
only wednesday the french aircraft builder aerospatiale 
announced an agreement to set up an international study group 
to look into the feasibility of building a successor to the aging 
supersonic concorde 
it said the american firms boeing and mcdonnell douglas along 
with the germain air bus will cooperate with aerospatiale and 
british aerospace in a study for a concorde replacement 
aerospatiale has said if the study finds a new supersonic model 
is feasible a faster larger and longer range plane than the 
concorde could be in the air by the year 2005

by all accounts pollution controls in new 
clean air legislation would have a wide impact from the cost of a 
car to whether the corner dry cleaner stays open 
everybody is going to find out that clean air is not free 
said rep john dingell dmich after he and other house members 
overwhelmingly approved a farreaching clean air bill late 
wednesday 
dingell along with rep henry waxman dcalif was at the 
center of lengthy negotiations that resolved more than a decade of 
disputes over tougher clean air provisions the senate also has 
crafted a compromise bill agreeable to most members and supported 
by the white house 
the senates approval of a bill april 3 and the house action 
this week marked the first time in 13 years that either body had 
agreed to even consider on the floor changes in federal air 
pollution laws 
the senate and house bills must now be brought in line with each 
other before legislation goes to president bush for his signature 
the two bills share generally broad outlines for attaining cleaner 
air by cutting acid rain pollutants in half requiring sharp 
reductions in smogcausing pollutants from automobiles and 
demanding that industry control its releases of toxic chemicals 
but in all of these areas the timetables differ slightly at 
times the requirements favor one industry or segment of an industry 
over another or benefit one region of the country over another 
clean air legislation has been such a thorny issue in congress 
because so many diverse and at times competing constituencies are 
affected while a section of the legislation eases the acid rain 
problem for the northeast for example it also poses hardships to 
the midwest where utilities and their customers will have to pay 
for pollution controls 
the white house has been determined to keep the costs of the 
legislation down and limit its impact on economic growth even so 
bush administration officials estimate the new bill will cost the 
economy 215 billion a year when all its requirements are 
implemented 
industry says the cost will be much higher and that some sectors 
of the economy such as steel might be forced to close plants 
more than 5000 highsulfur coal miners are expected to lose their 
jobs because tougher acid rain controls and will force some 
utilities to shift to a cleaner burning fuel 
the white house is expected to push for deletion of a jobloss 
assistance provision that was included in the house version but is 
not in the senate bill the administration calls the 250 million 
program over five years too expensive 
oil industry lobbyists have vowed through their friends in 
congress to continue a push to soften requirements for the sale of 
a cleaner gasoline blend with an oxygen content the oil companies 
say will require a grainbased ethanol additive in nine badly 
polluted cities 
and the automakers dont plan to give up trying to get out of 
the bills a proposal though significantly scaled back that 
requires them to produce and sell up to 300000 alternative fuel 
vehicles by the end of the decade 
lobbying has been intense largely because of the impact the 
legislation will have on everyone from the operators of chemicals 
plants to the purchaser of a new car 
tougher emission control requirements for cars will require 
automakers to design new equipment which could increase the cost 
of a car by as much as 500 according to industry estimates 
environmentalists said the cost increase is inflated 
requirements for cleaner fuels in the most polluted urban areas 
of the country are expected to raise the price of gasoline slightly 
under the house bill some small businesses would have to 
install new controls to combat smog in areas with the worst 
pollution the senate version exempts polluters that emit less than 
100 tons a year but the house bill in some cases covers polluters 
of onetenth that amount 
if the house prevails some small businesses such as the corner 
dry cleaner might be forced to close suggest industry lobbyists 
new controls for sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain will 
force some midwest utilities to increase rates significantly 
according to utility lobbyists the epa estimates the average 
electric rate will increase no more than 3 percent but the agency 
concedes increases could be 15 percent or more for customers of 
some utilities in the midwest

which have been feuding over indiancontrolled kashmir the two 
countries which have fought wars over the area in 1949 and 1965

ms bhutto returned late wednesday from visits to iran turkey 
syria jordan north yemen egypt libya and tunisia a

hindudominated india accuses pakistan of arming and training 
kashmiri militants fighting for secession of jammukashmir indias 
only state with a moslem majority pakistan which is dominated by 
moslems denies the indian charge 
since the indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants 
in late january more than 400 people have been killed 
during her trip abroad ms bhutto said all her host countries 
agreed that india and pakistan needed to find a lasting political 
settlement of the 43yearold dispute 
however she added if subjected to aggression we would have 
the full support of the arab islamic nations pakistan i was 
assured would never be left alone 
we believe the threats to peace are grave she said we 
cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict but we do not 
believe war is inevitable she told reporters 
ms bhutto said she opposes an independent kashmir she said it 
was not envisioned when india and pakistan gained independence in a 
1947 partition 
the prime minister again called for talks between pakistan and 
india she also said a neutral body should look into the charges 
made by both sides

president bush told the provisional president 
of haiti on thursday that he hopes a date for elections in her 
country will be announced soon 
president ertha pascaltrouillot told bush she had invited the 
united nations and the organization of american states to monitor 
elections in haiti when they are held a white house statement said 
she later told reporters that only haitis election council 
composed of representatives from labor human rights and business 
groups can determine a date for the balloting 
pascaltrouillot formerly a supreme court judge has promised 
to relinquish power to an elected government before the end of the 
year 
bush promised her the united states would support haitis 
transition to democracy with election aid the white house said 
the administration has asked congress for 3 million to 
underwrite haitis elections but the request has been stalled by 
congressional wrangling over a companion request for aid to 
nicaragua and panama 
secretary of state james a baker iii and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft took part in the first meeting between a 
us president and a civilian haitian president since 1941 
pascaltrouillot assumed her duties in midmarch after lt gen 
prosper avril was ousted in a popular uprising and fled to the 
united states haiti has drifted from one political crisis to 
another since the ouster of president jeanclaude duvalier in early 
1986 
last week the administration announced it would give haiti 18 
million to buy food bush also asked congress for 10 million in 
emergency aid to allow the government to buy gasoline and meet 
other urgent needs 
the united states canada and france the three major donors of 
aid to the impoverished island suspended assistance to haiti in 
1988 to protest abuses by its military rulers and the lack of 
democratic elections 
some us aid continued to be funneled through private 
organizations directly to needy haitians bypassing the government

all of mozarts 835 compositions will be 
performed at lincoln center over 19 months to observe the 200th 
anniversary next year of the composers death 
the plan to perform all the compositions is believed to be a 
first lincoln center officials said wednesday in making the 
announcement 
the initial concert of the mozart bicentennial is jan 27 1991 
said lincoln center president nathan leventhal 
the opening concert will recreate a program that mozart 
conducted of his compositions on march 23 1783 in vienna it has 
143 minutes of music compared with typical 70 to 90minute 
concerts today zubin mehta will conduct members of the new york 
philharmonic and the juilliard orchestra 
viennaborn erich leinsdorf will conduct mozarts requiem on 
dec 5 1991 the 200th anniversary of the composers death in 
vienna 
f murray abraham who portrayed mozart rival antonio salieri in 
the movie amadeus suggested that a couple of salieris best 
compositions be included in the programs and that audiences be 
asked to guess which they were 
i think 90 percent of the audience would not be able to tell 
the difference between mozart and salieri compositions the actor 
said i think salieri has been much maligned in the film he has 
done me a great great favor and i would like to return the 
compliment abraham won an academy award for his performance 
bicentennial donors included the samuels foundation nine 
japanese corporations the e nakamichi foundation the national 
endowment for the humanities and alice tully said lincoln center 
board chairman george weissman he said that approximately 10 
concerts will be televised by pbs 
in the regular concert repertory we only hear maybe a tenth of 
what mozart wrote i think we are going to find he wrote wonderful 
works at all periods in his life said neal zaslaw music 
professor at cornell university who is advising the bicentennial

president george bush says he has no burning 
desire to station us forces in germany and elsewhere overseas 
a leading west german politician said on thursday 
otto graf lambsdorff chairman of the junior coalition partner 
free democratic party and former economics minister said he told 
bush during a white house meeting on thursday that his party 
favored continued north american troop presence in a unified 
germany 
he said he has no burning desire to have american troops 
everywhere and i told him perhaps we dont have a burning desire 
but there is a desire for quite some time for american troops 
certainly as long as we do have soviet troops lambsdorff told a 
reporter 
west germany is host to about 280000 american soldiers and 
bush has proposed cutting them to 195000 but there is widespread 
speculation the number would drop much more if an eastwest 
agreement can be reached on conventional forces 
lambsdorff said that soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
certainly will take time to remove forces from east germany if 
the two germanys reach a unification agreement between themselves 
and with the four victor nations of world war ii britain 
france the soviet union and britain 
he cannot take 380000 men plus family members back home from 
one day to the next he said so we will have a transitional 
period and that has to be accepted

sen phil gramm criticizing mayor marion 
barrys management of the citys drug and financial problems said 
thursday he may try to force the district of columbia to spend more 
money on the police fight against crime 
the threat of congressional intervention came in barrys first 
capitol hill appearance since his jan 18 arrest on cocaine charges 
police officials burdened by a record murder rate for the last 
two years have recently said that overtime patrols in the citys 
highrent georgetown area were threatened by funding shortages 
im not into trying to play mayor but something is wrong 
when people are being notified to stay out of georgetown at night 
because we dont have police officers gramm rtexas told barry 
he said he may try to get other senators to approve a measure an 
unprecedented measure to direct the city to spend a portion of its 
4305 million federal payment on the police department congress 
last year gave the city 317 million to fight drugs 
city officials object to such intervention but president bush 
reiterated thursday his opposition to statehood for the district 
he said he hadnt considered a proposal to give the city 
congressional representation without statehood 
hadnt really got it in mind interested in talking about 
it bush said at a press conference have done nothing about it 
at all except to continually restate my opposition because this is 
a federal city to statehood for the district 
barry who is facing trial next month on cocaine possession 
conspiracy and perjury charges said the city has boosted police 
spending sharply to fight a crime problem that has drawn nationwide 
attention 
no one in this city is more concerned about public safety than 
i am said barry theres been some criticism lately that this 
government is not committed to public safety the facts of the 
matter do not support any such conclusion 
sen brock adams dwash chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee that oversees the district told barry the dispute over 
anticrime spending puts a cloud over the citys 1991 fiscal 
year budget in congress 
i have concerns about other portions of the budget but i 
think sen gramm speaks for a large number of our colleagues 
adams said until we get that straightened out we cant get to 
those other things this is a hurdle we cant overcome

the justice department was pushing for tough 
fines for corporations convicted of crimes three days before it 
abruptly withdrew support for the plan a us sentencing 
commissioner said thursday 
they were talking about tough guidelines and i heard them 
out george e mackinnon a federal appellate judge and member of 
the us sentencing commission told a congressional hearing about 
his march 13 meeting with justice department officials 
rep john conyers dmich and other democrats charged that the 
abrupt reversal made it appear that business interests may have 
pressured the white house and the department of justice to go soft 
on the subject 
the meeting occurred three days before deputy attorney general 
donald b ayer wrote the commission to withdraw a feb 26 letter 
expressing the agencys support for a new formula for imposing 
fines and other penalties on companies unions and other 
organizations convicted of crimes 
ayer announced his resignation may 11 shortly after it was 
disclosed that attorney general dick thornburgh had ordered him to 
write the march 16 letter 
department officials say thornburgh issued the order at the 
request of the white house which had received questions about the 
proposed guidelines from business groups 
thornburgh ordered the feb 26 letter withdrawn because it 
hadnt been cleared with him before it was sent officials have 
said 
paul l maloney deputy assistant attorney general told 
lawmakers that the justice department was still committed to tough 
guidelines saying the feb 26 letter was withdrawn because the 
attorney general wanted an opportunity to thoroughly review the 
highly complex matter 
the review that is presently going on does not in any way 
represent a repudiation of the departments position on the 
proposed sentencing guidelines options he said 
maloney said he didnt know about the white house call to 
thornburghs office until he read about it in newspaper accounts 
last month a member of thornburghs staff confirmed the report of 
the call maloney said 
the commission intended to promulgate the guidelines by this 
month but on april 10 tabled further action until three vacancies 
on the sevenmember panel are filled 
circuit judge william w wilkins jr told the panel he would 
have pushed for a vote on guidelines by the panels four members 
but mackinnon said he would not support any proposal until the 
commission was brought up to full strength 
in his testimony mackinnon dismissed suggestions that he 
withheld his vote because of pressure from the white house or the 
justice department 
mackinnon said he wanted to postpone the vote because he feared 
that business interests that had waged vigorous if not vicious 
opposition would attack these guidelines in an invalid point 
that they were not passed by a full commission 
mackinnon said he told justice department officials of his 
thinking during the march 13 meeting 
the commission created in 1984 has already promulgated 
sentencing guidelines for individual defendants that specify 
factors that should be used in calculating the length of prison 
terms

there were victims dead he told belgian radio figures 
are not final according to witnesses between 10 and more than 
100 
zaire authorities have reported one dead and 13 injured 
authorities in zaire denied earlier belgian news reports that 50 
to 150 students opposing president mobutu sese sekos regime had 
been murdered amnesty reports from lubumbashi gave the same

amnesty said the unarmed students died under the cover of 
darkness at the hands of security forces in a premeditated and 
extensive attack the group said in a written statement many 
more students were believed to have been injured the londonbased 
organization said 
the killings allegedly took place after some students had beaten 
several of their peers suspected of being informers for the 
government 
amnesty is calling on the government to immediately set up an 
independent inquiry into the reported killings and to bring those 
responsible for the killings to justice 
the government has maintained the troops were used to quell 
violence between students on campus 
soldiers from the elite presidential division allegedly carried 
out the killings 
since april students on several campuses throughout the former 
belgian colony including in the capital kinshasa have been 
demonstrating for political reforms 
on april 25 mobutu announced the government would allow two new 
political parties in addition to his ruling popular movement of the 
revolution 
five days later the presidential troops used guns and bayonets 
to disperse a crowd gathering for an opposition demonstration many 
people were injured several were reportedly killed and more than a 
dozen demonstrators were arrested amnesty said 
demonstrations at the campus in kinshasa protesting the 
governments refusal to implement promised reforms sparked 
demonstrations at other zairean campuses 
in bukavu in eastern zaire three people accused of organizing 
local farmers and instigating students demonstrations were arrested 
and are belived to still be in custody amnesty said 
the us state department said in its annual human rights report

here are details of the mostfavorednation 
system of trade benefits bush renewed chinas status for another 
year on thursday but said the soviet union still doesnt qualify 
the status entitles a country to the mostfavorable levels of 
us tariffs the united states extends the privilege to all its 
major trading partners only 16 nations including the soviet 
union cuba and north korea dont receive the benefits 
china has had the status since 1980 the soviet union had it 
from 1933 to 1952 when congress revoked it the soviets have not 
had it since then 
the jacksonvanik amendment to 1974 trade legislation denies 
mfn status to countries that do not permit free emigration of 
minorities it is this law that now keeps the soviet union from 
qualifying president bush on thursday said chinas emigration 
policy makes it eligible for mfn treatment 
to regain mfn status the soviet union must enter into a trade 
agreement with the united states and it must put into law an 
openemigration policy moscow and the united states are currently 
working on such a trade agreement the soviet congress is expected 
to act on a liberalized emigration law by late spring or early 
summer 
mfn status must be renewed each year bush had until june 3 to 
act on chinas eligibility 
although it may be hard for a nation like the soviet union to 
get back on the list once nations are there they tend to stay 
there among the nations extended mostfavorednation treatment are 
south africa iraq and syria 
removal of mfn status can send tariffs soaring the bush 
administration says tariffs on chinese goods headed for the united 
states would swell by an average 40 percent if the preferential 
status were revoked the uschina business council says some 
chinamade toys now taxed at 68 percent would be taxed at up to 70 
percent 
revoking chinas mfn status would also send tariffs soaring on

east german students on thursday applauded a 
government decision to fire 6700 school directors and hundreds of 
ideology teachers who once drilled marxist doctrine into the 
nations youth 
the educators will still be allowed to reapply for their old 
jobs but students said the move was an important step in repairing 
an education system that faces huge changes in order to adapt to a 
democratic society as east and west germany reunite 
educators under the old hardline regime played key roles in 
identifying dissenters and indoctrinating students in communist 
ideology 
annette blottner a 22yearold english language student at east 
berlins humboldt university said the decision to open up the jobs 
of top educators is justified even though many embraced the revolt 
last year that toppled the old regime 
i had a teacher who was so stalinist she damaged a lot of 
futures of people she said now she acts like she was with 
the revolution all the time 
government spokesman matthias gehler said wednesday that in 
addition to the 6700 school chiefs 550 professors and dozens of 
other teachers who specialized in marxistleninist doctrine also 
would be removed 
the school chiefs will be allowed to apply for their old jobs 
and the ideology professors can seek new education posts but they 
must guarantee their democratic legitimacy gehler said 
falk nisius a mathematics and computer science teacher at 
humboldt said most heads of schools were loyal communists who came 
through an educational system that only tolerated strict conformity 
when you are a teacher the first year you are idealistic and 
think you will be different said nisius 25 but after a few 
years you realize that youre job is to only stabilize the system 
the whole approach was to break you down 
east germany also plans to disband the oncepowerful youth 
organization that for decades groomed loyal members and leaders of 
the ousted communist party 
the free german youth will soon lose its financing said youth 
and sports minister cordula schubert in an interview thursday with 
the west german newspaper the berliner morgenpost 
membership in the group was mandatory and helped direct the 
career paths of the hardline leaders who were overthrown in last 
falls revolt former communist party leader erich honecker was a 
member of the group 
the free german youth which once had 2 million members has 
20000 members 
in another attempt to remove vestiges of the past economics 
minister gerhard pohl said wednesday that 100 directors of east 
german industries and businesses would be dismissed 
all the moves are part of a program by the government to remove 
industry and education leaders who got their jobs through strict 
party loyalty and to prepare for the july 2 economic merger with 
west germany 
also thursday a government spokesman said 109 of the 149 
members of the special antiterrorist police unit worked as agents 
for the disbanded secret police 
the interior ministry spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the remaining 40 members of the antiterrorist unit 
came from the east german army 
the antiterrorist unit was formed in december under the former 
government of communist premier hans modrow 
he led the reformoriented caretaker government that ran east 
germany after communist hardliners were ousted in november but 
modrows retooled communist party was voted out of power in the 
nations first democratic elections on march 18 
the new government of prime minister lothar de maiziere has been 
debating what to do with the 80000 people who once worked for the 
secret police

nbc retained its nielsen crown but suffered an 
18 percent ratings drop as it narrowly beat hardcharging cbs in 
what all three networks thursday called the tightest may sweeps 
race in seven years 
nbc which has won the prime time ratings race for five straight 
seasons won the april 26may 23 sweeps battle with an 119 ratings 
average cbs had an 118 and abc an 114 each ratings point 
represents 921000 homes 
the ratings sweeps conducted four times a year are monthlong 
periods of intensive local audience tallies that help stations in 
the nations 211 television markets set advertising rates 
cbs has been third in prime time for three consecutive seasons 
its return as strong competitor in the may sweeps battle was aided 
by entertainment specials including the pilot of i love lucy 
tv movies and theatrical films and two connie chung news specials 
all got high ratings 
although abc was third in the may sweeps it also got good news 
its programs including china beach and thirtysomething 
helped make it first in ratings among viewers particularly women 
considered the most desirable by advertisers age 18 to 54 
abcs americas funniest home videos was easily the 
highestrated series during the sweeps race with an average 38 
percent share 
the top 20 shows included fox broadcastings married with 
children and the simpsons which were tied in 17th place with 
identical 23 percent audienceshare averages 
it was the first time fox shows have cracked the top 20 list 
during a sweeps race 
nbc research vice president robert niles acknowledging the 
narrow margin of victory in nbcs ninth consecutive sweeps triumph 
nonetheless said hed take it 
a win is a win he told reporters at the first of two news 
conferences cbs research chief david poltrack held the second 
at which the two officials generally accentuated the positive and 
played down the negative 
the last time the three networks were as close in may sweeps 
ratings was in 1983 when cbs was first with a 151 ratings 
average followed by nbc with a 149 and abc with a 147 according 
to nbc research officials 
niles said nbcs 18 percent ratings falloff in may compared 
with the previous may was partly due to allout efforts the network 
made last year to win a record five consecutive may sweeps and 
partly because some tryouts of new series didnt work this time 
however he emphasized one shouldnt look at the may results as 
an indicator of what nbcs justreleased 19901991 program lineup 
will do next fall we think we can turn this around as we go into 
the fall he said 
poltrack whose network is to release its fall schedule either 
friday or next tuesday said there will a lot more cbs 
firepower this fall because the network will have a heavy load of 
tv and theatrical films 
the latter include born on the fourth of july and field of 
dreams part of a 10picture package cbs bought this year from 
universal studios 
poltrack called nbcs may results an omen of bad things to come 
for that network comparing abcs results with those of may last 
year he also said the success of americas funniest home 
videos tended to mask declining ratings for four other abc shows 
including the stillsuccessful roseanne 
there may be such a decline on a maytomay basis said abc 
research chief alan wurtzel but the real test is how a show 
performs over the course of a season 
sweeps are important to the affiliate stations he said in 
an interview but im not so sure that a sweeps period 
particularly if its atypical is a very good indicator of how 
youre going to perform as a network

president bush on thursday called for 
restraint by israeli soldiers in violent clashes with palestinians 
saying he was troubled about the loss of human life 
bush told a news conference the solution to the regions 
problems is to get peace talks moving i will do everything i can 
to get the talks for peace going he said 
but he said the united states couldnt exert more pressure on 
its longtime ally for peace talks with the palestinians because of 
israels own unsettled political situation 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir is trying to form a new 
government but that process is expected to take another two weeks 
there is no firm decisionmaking government in place so were 
in a bit of a hiatus because of that he said 
middle east violence flared this week after an israeli gunman 
killed seven palestinians on sunday demonstrations against israel 
and the united states spread in the region and more than a dozen 
more palestinians have been killed most by israeli military 
gunfire hundreds have been injured by bullets beatings or from 
inhaling tear gas 
the new violence follows the 29monthold intifada uprising in 
which 710 palestinians have died 
bush dodged questions about whether israel was responding 
appropriately to the palestinian uprisings in the occupied 
territories 
i have called on both sides for restraint ive called on the 
israeli forces to show restraint he said 
he added im worried about it im troubled about the loss of 
human life in this area particularly of children in this kind 
of situation 
bush said us officials are talking with a lot of people to 
try to promote the peace process and that he had spoken by phone on 
wednesday with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
secretary of state james a baker iii said wednesday the united 
states is prepared to discuss the idea of setting up a united 
nations observer force to protect the 17 million arabs living in 
the occupied territories 
but israel strongly opposes that idea and state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler issued a new statement reiterating 
the longstanding us opposition to un observers permanently on 
the west bank and in gaza 
she said baker had in mind temporary visits to check out the 
situation and was willing only to discuss such an arrangement at 
the un security council meeting in geneva 
seymour d reich chairman of the conference of presidents of 
american jewish organizations an umbrella for 46 groups said 
bakers comment plays into the hand of arab hardliners and thus 
disserves the cause of peace he said statement appears to 
distance the united states from israel 
palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat is 
expected to propose the use of un observers in the territories 
when he speaks friday to a un security council session in geneva 
on capitol hill meanwhile bushs middle east policy came under 
sharp attack on thursday as a state department report on the plo 
was presented to congress 
democrats criticized the reports conclusion that the plo has 
lived up to its commitment to refrain from terrorism 
the united states has said it would halt its dialogue with the 
plo if there were violations of that commitment 
but rep larry smith dfla called the administrations report 
a pack of lies a sham and a fraud 
john kelly the assistant secretary of state for the middle 
east denied that the report was dishonest 
there is no conclusive evidence to indicate plo violations of 
its commitment

dozens of boats of all description 
crossed the choppy english channel and sailed into this french port 
thursday to commemorate the evacuation of allied troops from 
dunkirk 50 years ago 
the 10hour crossing by the socalled little ships begins a 
weekend of celebrations reuniting about 5000 french and british 
veterans some in their 90s who fled to england just ahead of 
the advancing german army in 1940 
the vessels hoisted the british naval ensign and entered dunkirk 
waters in formation thursday afternoon behind the frigate hms 
alacrity to be greeted by a throng of local officials and 
wellwishers 
its a onceinalifetime thing i suppose hon british 
consul to dunkirk sandy baker said they wont be able to do this 
again 50 years from now 
britains prince philip husband of queen elizabeth ii stood on 
the dover docks to give a royal sendoff to 76 vessels reenacting 
the world war ii mission that rescued 338000 troops off beaches in 
northern france and belgium before onrushing german troops 
at the end of may 1940 tankled german forces drove allied 
troops onto the beaches of dunkirk and de panne belgium 20 miles 
away where they were trapped with their backs to the channel 
on may 29 the british government appealed to owners of all 
types of vessels to volunteer to help make up for the shortage of 
troop transports and amateur and professional sailors raced across 
the channel in their boats to aid the allies 
over the next seven days an armada of about 860 naval ships 
fishing boats and pleasure craft rescued almost 400000 british 
french and belgian troops under enemy fire 
on thursday less than two hours after the boats sailed from 
southern england under bright blue skies one skipper was airlifted 
from his yacht when rough seas began causing trouble 
richard huggett was picked up from his 33foot yacht papillon by 
helicopter about seven miles off the british coast after suffering 
back injuries according to a coast guard spokesman 
british coast guard boats stood by to shepherd the elderly 
fleet which could only travel as fast as the slowest boat about 7 
mph in addition to winds and high seas the boats had to sail 
through the wakes of the ferries that frequently crisscross the 
channel 
about eight miles out a boat that once carried katharine 
hepburn and humphrey bogart in the hollywood film the african 
queen began taking on water off ramsgate 
a rescue helicopter from a neary royal air force base and a 
lifeboat were sent to escort and tow the 30foot steamdriven 
vessel back to harbor 
a dover coastguard spokesman said four people were on board 
including the american owner of the boat jim hendricks 
hendricks 55 a hotel owner from key largo fla said the 
system that pumps water into the boiler quit working 
it was much rougher than i expected the waves were getting 
pretty high hendricks said adding it was just too much for 
her 
the threeman crew of the boat which hendricks purchased in 
1982 said they were afraid the boat was going to overturn in the 
rough channel 
many of the boats experienced difficulties in the choppy channel 
and at least one other yacht had to be towed back less than an hour 
after setting sail 
the flotilla which will spend three days in the marine basin at 
dunkirk included motor launches cabin cruisers thames barges 
yachts old lifeboats and a former torpedo boat many are the 
original preserved craft that returned from the beaches in 1940 
with thousands of expeditionary forces aboard 
events commemorating the rescue will include a parade wreath 
layings lunches parties and a prayer service in dunkirk and in 
nearby de pannes

nasa has confirmed next wednesday as 
the official launch date for space shuttle columbia grounded for 
two weeks because of repairs to its cooling system 
were ready to go agency spokeswoman lisa malone said 
following a flight readiness review meeting thursday 
columbia will carry seven astronauts and the astro ultraviolet 
and xray observatory valued at about 150 million when it takes 
off on the first spacelab mission since 1985 it will be the 36th 
shuttle flight 
liftoff is scheduled for 1238 am edt making it the fifth 
nighttime shuttle launch 
the astro mission originally was scheduled for march 1986 but 
the challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 resulted in a lengthy 
delay the flight was rescheduled for may 9 and then for around may 
17 but a problem with columbias cooling system was detected 
technicians then removed a cooling valve with a torn filter from 
the shuttles payload bay and replaced it with a new one it was 
the first time such work had ever been performed on an orbiter at 
the launch pad 
a final check of the cooling system this week found everything 
to be in order malone said technicians wednesday removed a 
makeshift platform erected in the payload bay and other work items 
and spent thursday closing out the shuttles rear engine 
compartment 
were not tracking any significant issues malone said 
there were no problems during that whole repair process 
columbias flight is expected to last nine to 10 days the four 
astronomers who are part of the crew will operate astros three 
ultraviolet telescopes and one xray telescope located in the 
payload bay 
the instruments will photograph the ultraviolet sky and 
simultaneously measure the high energy of ultraviolet and xray 
radiation wavelengths which are absorbed by the atmosphere and 
therefore invisible from the ground

president bush said thursday he is troubled by 
the perception that us policy toward cambodia is aiding the khmer 
rouge rebels and said a review of alternative strategies is under 
way 
at the same time bush said he believes the administration is 
on the right track in its quest for a comprehensive settlement 
to the 11year old conflict in cambodia he denied reports that 
us weapons are reaching the khmer rouge 
the united states has been providing limited assistance to the 
noncommunist resistance in cambodia those groups have a tactical 
alliance with the khmer rouge which is believed to have been 
responsible for the deaths of more than a million cambodians during 
its 3 years in power in the 1970s 
critics in the congress and elsewhere contend the united states 
shouldnt aid rebel factions tied to the khmer rouge at his news 
conference bush was asked whether he was troubled that us policy 
has the side affect of helping the khmer rouge 
to the degree it has any effect to help them yes i am 
uncomfortable about it bush said 
theres a discomfort level because of the brutality of the 
khmer rouge we are reviewing the whole policy now he said 
the united states is working with the four other permanent 
members of the un security council in the quest for a settlement 
in cambodia the five will meet in new york on friday and leaders 
of the various cambodian factions will meet in tokyo next week 
after bush spoke state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states hopes for a settlement that would verify the 
complete withdrawal of vietnamese troops from cambodia 
other objectives include preventing the return to power of the 
murderous khmer rouge and genuine selfdetermination for the 
cambodian people through unadministered free and fair elections 
in a politically neutral environment she said 
earlier china a key supporter of antigovernment resistance 
forces in cambodia said it is supporting plans for a ceasefire 
there 
the question of cambodia deserves a comprehensive political 
solution and a ceasefire is a component part of the agreement on a 
comprehensive settlement foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua 
said at a weekly briefing 
thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan said the threeparty 
resistance which is headed by prince norodom sihanouk had agreed 
to sign a cease fire soon with the vietnambacked government in 
cambodia 
the cambodian government has objected to any participation in a 
provisional government by the khmer rouge china which supplies 
arms and equipment to the khmer rouge says that group must be part 
of any peace settlement 
the proposed ceasefire is likely to be discussed when cambodian 
head of government hun sen meets sihanouk in tokyo june 45 son 
sann leader of another of the three guerrilla groups will also be 
in tokyo and may take part in the talks it is not certain if the 
khmer rouge participate 
bush hopes to discuss cambodia in his summit meeting next week 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev a senior administration 
official told reporters thursday the soviets provide weapons to 
the hun sen regime 
the bush administration believes the obstacle to a diplomatic 
solution in cambodia is hun sens refusal to relinquish power in an 
interim arrangement said the official spoke to white house 
reporters on the condition he not be identified by name 
the administration sees united nations peacekeeping role as 
the only way to have an end to the war and some process for 
selfdetermination the official said and in such a process we 
think hun sen will have to step down as head of government

president bush said thursday that one of his 
chief missions at next weeks summit is to try to convince soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev that a unified germany should belong 
to nato 
well sit down hell tell me his views and i will tell him 
that he has absolutely nothing to fear from that formulation 
bush said in an interview with gerd helbig a correspondent with 
zdf german tv 
historically theyve seen nato as an enemy and weve seen 
the soviets as an enemy today the enemy in my view is 
instability unpredictability and lack of confidence in each 
other bush said 
in a separate interview with martyn lewis of the bbc bush said 
the impasse in the soviet union over the fate of lithuania and 
other baltic states continues to cast a pall over the superpower 
summit 
theres a cloud of tension because of the baltic states 
bush said 
i determined a long time ago that it was important that this 
summit meeting go forward and be successful he said and yet i 
would be misleading you if i didnt say that the inability to get 
dialogue going there between the lithuanians and the soviets does 
cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the united states 
both interviews were conducted in the white house on thursday 
afternoon after bush addressed some of the same topics at a morning 
news conference the white house released transcripts of both 
interviews 
in the interview with german tv bush was asked what he might do 
at the may 31june 3 summit to make the notion of a unified germany 
inside nato more palatable to gorbachev 
i feel it is incumbent on me to try to convince mr 
gorbachev that there is no threat to the soviet union with a 
unified germany and with a us presence and with germany as a full 
member of nato bush said 
now the soviets dont agree with what ive just said he 
said adding that he intended to engage the soviet leader into a 
full discussion of the german unity question 
in the same interview bush said he was a little 
disappointed that talks over cutting the levels of troops and 
tanks in europe had seemed to bog down 
i thought we would have the agreement further along he said 
weve got some big problems here but we also have a lot of 
common ground he told the german tv interviewer 
in the british interview bush said the european questions 
likely to come up at the summit are not solved by a long shot 
lewis asked bush if he thought gorbachev would survive

a florist in a rural community who 
claimed he was beaten and harassed because people wrongly thought 
he had aids apparently made up the story authorities said thursday 
kanawha county prosecutor bill forbes said bill grealis checked 
himself into the psychiatric unit of thomas memorial hospital on 
thursday after being confronted with evidence that he was making 
harassing telephone calls to himself 
que stephens sr head of the state human rights commission 
said grealis was the target of a sting operation involving 20 
members of the attorney generals staff monitoring grealis home 
and pay telephones stephens said grealis did not know of the sting 
we have been preyed upon by this guy forbes told a news 
conference at the capitol there has been a perpetration of a 
fraud on all of us who stand here and all of the media too 
forbes said he did not know the reason behind grealis behavior 
saying the florist may have wanted the publicity 
grealis plight came to the attention of reporters when he 
complained he was threatened beaten his business boycotted and 
his workplace broken into because of a rumor in the campbell creaks 
community that he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
grealis had said business at his flower shop dropped 80 percent 
since december and that he nearly went insane 
he had said he lost weight because of a prostate ailment and 
went so far as to post a negative aids test result on the shop 
window in an attempt to convince his neighbors that he didnt carry 
the deadly virus 
forbes said it appeared the alleged beating injuries may have 
been selfinflicted and theres a lot of question whether or not 
a robbery occurred 
its been a tragedy forbes said this guy has a very 
serious problem of a psychological nature no charges have been 
filed against grealis and the investigation is continuing he said

shouting down with communism 
antigovernment protesters on thursday staged their largest rally 
since nationwide voting that overwhelmingly backed the interim 
leadership 
the protesters demanded the ouster of presidentelect ion 
iliescu a former communist who has led the interim government 
since the revolution that ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu in 
december 
when a speaker accused iliescu and his governing national 
salvation front of rigging sundays election about 8000 
demonstrators at university square cheered wildly and shouted 
thieves 
one man who shouted iliescu was pushed and shoved and left 
the square pursued by shouting protesters several dozen 
proiliescu factory workers got into a shoving match with 
demonstrators but protest organizers separated them 
about 600 of the demonstrators carrying candles later marched to 
the television station where some of the fiercest fighting of the 
revolution took place 
the demonstrators led by three orthodox priests in black robes 
knelt at a memorial to the victims of the revolution while the 
demonstrators prayed sang and left flowers police did not 
interfere and the protesters later dispersed peacefully 
with almost all votes counted late thursday iliescu had 852 
percent of the vote in the threeway presidential race radu 
campeanu of the national liberal party had 106 percent and ion 
ratiu of the national peasant party had 42 percent 
several thousand protesters have flocked to university square 
nightly to support demonstrators who occupied it more than a month 
ago and designated it a communistfree zone 
but the largest postelection crowd flocked to the square 
thursday night ignoring prime minister petre romans warning that 
the demonstration was unacceptable 
police detained three people thursday for advertising the rally 
staterun radio quoted police as saying the protest was not 
authorized only a few traffic police were in sight around the 
square

police to clear the square iliescu said he would use no force 
i hope

claiming his election landslide was fraudulent 
the demonstrators major demand is to prohibit all former top 
communist officials including iliescu from holding public 
office for 10 years iliescu was a communist party politburo member

continued to fast despite a plea from romanias bestknown 
dissident doina cornea to give up and help unite the opposition 
i am prepared to die said bogdan gradin who has been 
fasting since may 1 in ceausescus time it was enough not to 
participate not to prostitute yourself but now its a moral 
commitment to do something more and this is the only way i can 
the western democracies should initiate an economic blockade 
until we get a democratic government in romania he said 
at a news conference peasant party chairman corneliu coposu was 
asked if his organization would heed iliescus call to join in a 
coalition government he said romanias three traditional 
noncommunist parties the peasants liberals and social 
democratic party had a postelection agreement with seven other

israel will not allow un observers into the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip even if the un security 
council approves creating a special force to protect palestinians 
israeli leaders said thursday 
i dont assume the security council would decide so since it 
would clearly know that this decision would not be implemented as 
many other un decisions against israel said prime minister 
yitzhak shamir 
israel will not be able to accept such a decision therefore 
i hope it would not be adopted he said on israel television 
foreign minister moshe arens told a news conference thursday he 
hoped the 15nation council which is to meet in geneva on friday 
would turn down arab calls for such a forceisrael would not 
accept un observers on territory under israeli control arens 
said 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
palestinian leaders have demanded international observers to 
protect the 17 million arabs in the territories from any excessive 
force by the israeli army 
the calls have increased since sundays slaying near tel aviv of 
seven unarmed palestinian laborers by an israeli gunman fifteen 
more palestinians including an 8yearold boy have been killed 
since then most by gunfire from israeli soldiers hundreds have 
been injured 
the latest victim was mohammed samir salha 15 who died at the 
west banks ramallah hospital on thursday of head and chest wounds 
from plastic bullets hospital officials said he was shot during 
an army raid on the village of kibiya 
salhas death raised to 720 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians since the arab uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied territories began in december 1987 
an additional 216 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israel fortythree 
israelis have died 
the army on thursday lifted a curfew on the gaza strip for two 
hours to allow palestinians to shop for food and other necessities 
the curfew has been in effect since sunday 
arab reports said hundreds of palestinian youths took to the 
streets of gaza city to burn tires and block roads with stones when 
the curfew was relaxed 
arab hospital officials reported two wounded protesters at the 
jabaliya refugee camp the army had no immediate confirmation 
curfews were lifted permanently from several large west bank 
towns the army said 
also in the west bank angry jewish settlers briefly blocked the 
jerusalemnablus road to protest a palestinian stonethrowing 
attack on a settlers car that reportedly injured an israeli infant 
a soviet official warned thursday that settlement of soviet 
jewish immigrants in the occupied lands would block chances for 
normal relations between israel and the soviet union 
israel is behaving like an elephant in a china shop halting 
process of normalization in the relations with soviet union said 
michael kapitsa head of the institute of eastern studies in moscow 
and a supreme soviet member 
the soviet union cut ties with israel after the 1967 war it 
renewed lowlevel diplomatic relations in 1987 but still has no 
full diplomatic ties with israel 
in his remarks at bengurion airport near tel aviv kapitsa also 
strongly criticized the crackdown on the palestinian uprising he 
said it is in direct contradiction with other peaceful trends 
in the world today 
he was in israel with a fivemember delegation invited by a 
palestinian think tank 
the call for a special un force is expected to be made at the 
security council meeting by plo chairman yasser arafat 
in a surprise move wednesday us secretary of state james 
baker said the united states would consider a proposal for a 
special un force to be deployed in the territories 
arens said israel was counting on the united states to veto any 
un security council resolution calling for an observer force 
he also defended the armys actions this week saying security 
forces acted in an exemplary manner in dealing with widespread 
rioting 
israeli officials contend israel is legally responsible for 
administering territories seized in the 1967 war and that foreign 
observers already are present in the form of un relief workers 
red cross teams foreign aid officials and journalists 
we have always opposed the idea of stationing un observers 
because we view it as a violation of israels sovereignty and an 
intervention in our internal affairs said avi pazner shamirs 
spokesman 
french government official bernard kouchner toured the gaza 
strip on thursday to evaluate the condition of palestinian 
residents 
gaza looks like a city of ghosts where women walk around with 
babies in their arms in order to buy food israel radio quoted 
him as saying 
kouchner frances secretary of state for humanitarian action 
was one of the first foreigners to visit gaza since sundays 
shooting 
journalists have been barred from the gaza strip except with 
army escorts

ohio state officials who shut down a 
dormitory wing following death threats against two homosexual 
students said thursday they will seek criminal charges against the 
people responsible 
officials moved 32 male students from a thirdfloor wing of a 
dormitory wednesday after one threat was written on a notice taped 
to the door of the gay students room 
the words die fags were found on the notice 
the notice from the universitys office of residence life had 
been sent to all students in the dorm wing tuesday warning they 
would be reassigned to other dorms if another act of harassment or 
intimidation toward the gay students was reported 
the threatening note was taped to the center of the door 
surrounded by 14 copies of the university notice 
we are actively investigating this threat as well as telephone 
death threats the students received before this said william 
hall ohio state universitys director of residence and dining 
halls i cant say now that we have any solid leads but we hope 
to come up with some charges will be filed 
hall said not all of the students forced to move were involved 
in the harassment but that it was necessary to move the entire 
floor 
students mike scarce and tom fletcher became the target of 
harassment last october 
their names appeared in a campus newspaper article reporting the 
events of coming out week on campus said michael mcfadden 
executive director of stonewall union a lesbiangay community 
service and advocacy organization 
the two said in an interview published thursday in the columbus 
dispatch that they are not lovers but decided to room together 
after they met last year 
scarce said he believes the school took too long to take action 
and will seek reimbursment for threequarters of their tuition and 
room and board costs 
this is no environment to live in let alone to be educated 
in he said 
hall said the school will negotiate with the two 
the two students could not be reached for comment thursday 
university spokesman steve sterrett said they had moved to an 
offcampus apartment but declined to give an address

an ordinance banning cigarette 
vending machines has met with total compliance since it went into 
effect in january a city official said thursday 
weve had a tremendous amount of success with our ordinance 
here said city manager mark sather when the ordinance took 
effect we had 100 percent compliance and little or no opposition 
on thursday federal health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan proposed model federal legislation to help states outlaw 
cigarette vending machines as well as place other restrictions on 
young peoples access to cigarettes 
you cant buy beer from a vending machine he said in 
testimony prepared for the senate finance committee why should 
you be able to purchase cigarettes there 
white bear lake already took such a step last october when the 
twin cities suburb of around 25000 approved an ordinance to remove 
the 19 machines in local bars gas stations convenience stores and 
apartment and office buildings 
it was the first city in minnesota to enact such a ban but at 
least 20 other minnesota cities have prohibited or limited such 
sales since white bear lakes action 
weve had well over 200 communities from coast to coast call 
and ask for copies of our ordinance and so its gained quite a bit 
of notoriety sather said 
the vending machine industry has argued that children can be 
protected without a total ban using techniques such as employee 
supervision of machines and electronic locking devices that must be 
activated by an employee 
but antismoking activists contend that youngsters would find 
ways to buy cigarettes as long as the machines were in use 
obviously were encouraged by it for the same reasons the 
local ordinance was adopted here 
sather said he found the administrations proposal a good idea 
for the same reasons the local ordinance was adopted here 
the advantage of trying to prevent or avoid juveniles trying 
to smoke is the primary purpose behind our ordinance to make it 
difficult for them to gain access to cigarettes we think it sends 
a message that we dont condone it

the united states has no plans to return a 
mexican doctor brought across the border by bounty hunters to face 
charges of participating in a drug agents murder officials said 
thursday 
mexicos request for the return of dr humberto alvarez machain 
was received by the state department and the us will respond in 
due course justice department spokesman doug tillett said 
however officials who spoke on condition of anonymity noted 
that mexico had not made a formal extradition request calling 
merely for alvarezs return 
the officials also pointed to recent public statements by the 
justice department stressing that the us had no plans to return 
alvarez to his homeland 
justice department spokesman david runkel said several weeks ago 
that he couldnt foresee any circumstances under which alvarez 
would be returned 
alvarez accused of participating in the torture and murder of 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena was 
abducted by bounty hunters and flown to el paso texas on april 3 
his arrest by waiting dea agents touched off a diplomatic flap 
between the two nations that included a charge by president carlos 
salinas de gortari that it violated mexicos sovereignty 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a may 10 interview 
however that he was not concerned about the circumstances of 
alvarezs delivery to the us border he invited bounty hunters to 
turn over more mexicans wanted in the camarena case 
whatever actions that are carried out by mexican authorities 
are of no moment to us thornburgh said 
the mexican foreign ministry said in a statement issued 
wednesday in mexico city that the government wanted alvarezs 
return for questioning about possible crimes in mexico the 
statement did not mention specific cases 
this request is based fundamentally on the fact that the 
procedure followed by his captors and those who transferred dr 
alvarez machain violated articles of the mexican constitution 
the statement said 
alvarez is scheduled to appear in us district court in los 
angeles on friday for a hearing on defense motions to dismiss the 
charges because the circumstances of his arrest amounted to 
outrageous government conduct 
last week the justice department filed papers claiming that a 
mexican police official last year delivered an offer to swap a 
suspect in the camarena case for a fugitive wanted by mexican 
authorities 
the papers quoted the mexican official as saying he was speaking 
on behalf of mexican attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo 
the mexican attorney general has since issued a statement denying 
the justice department claim 
antonio garate bustamante a former mexican police official 
residing in los angeles has said he arranged alvarezs abduction 
for dea

air traffic controllers who take drugs to 
treat diabetes or aids should not automatically lose their jobs 
leaders of a house subcommittee said thursday 
reps gerry sikorski dminn and constance morella rmd 
urged the federal aviation administration to change what they 
consider a discriminatory policy 
darlene freeman faa deputy associate administrator for aviation 
standards told the house subcommittee on the civil service the 
agency offers administrative jobs to controllers who take insulin 
for diabetes or azt to combat aids 
thats discrimination subcommittee chairman sikorski said 
after testimony from patients and a diabetes expert that insulin 
users pose no more risk on the job than people with moderately high 
blood pressure those with moderately high blood pressure are not 
excluded from air traffic control positions 
its discrimination for the sake of safety said william 
hark an faa medical specialist he said controllers who take 
insulin could suffer episodes called hypoglycemia which could 
severely inhibit their work keeping track of aircraft 
hypoglycemia can cause faintness palsy confusion visual 
disturbances or weakness 
the faa says that since the insulin policy was put into effect 
in december the agencys flight surgeon dr robert mcmeekin has 
issued instructions that 22 controllers taking insulin can no 
longer work at radar screens 
sikorski criticized the faa for its refusal to allow dulles 
airport controller ron wilkinson to continue on the job after he 
began taking azt last year 
lord knows what vague rumors that decision was based on he 
said 
wilkinson who attended the hearing but did not testify said 
after the session that the faa suggested this week he might get an 
administrative job at dulles he said he is under a doctors care 
in florida and believes he should be given a position there as a 
controller 
hark said no final action had been taken to disqualify 
wilkinson who he said went on leave in july to seek treatment for 
an undisclosed illness 
the faa official said the agency was reexamining its policy on 
azt but probably would not change it without at least several 
months of study 
dr william reiter director of the center for special 
immunology in fort lauderdale fla where wilkinson is being 
treated has said that tests of patients on azt have shown no 
significant sleepiness dizziness or any other problems 
witnesses at the subcommittee hearing included minnesota vikings 
quarterback wade wilson who spoke for the american diabetes 
association and said his diabetes had not affected his performance 
as a professional football player 
each persons case should be considered individually and 
medical disqualification of all air traffic control specialists 
solely because they require insulin is blatantly discriminatory 
wilson said 
dr robert ratner director of the diabetes center at george 
washington university who said only four to 10 hypoglycemia 
episodes a year would be suffered among every 10000 people who are 
dependent on insulin

president bush said thursday that the kremlins 
standoff with lithuania and the other independenceminded baltic 
states has created a cloud of tension leading up to next weeks 
ussoviet summit in washington 
bush however said he expects progress on arms control and 
german unification during his may 30june 3 meetings with president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
in a us interview with british broadcasting corp television 
he said i determined long ago that it was important that this 
summit meeting go forward and be successful 
and yet i would be misleading you if i didnt say the 
inability to get dialogue going there between the lithuanians and 
the soviets does cause a lot of concern to a lot of us here in the 
united states the president said in the washington interview 
he added theres a cloud of tension because of the baltic 
states 
in the continuing test of wills gorbachev threatened thursday 
to impose presidential rule in lithuania if it does not freeze the 
independence it declared march 11 a lithuanian legislator said 
but gorbachev also offered to lift economic sanctions if lithuania 
suspends the declaration 
in the thursday talks with lithuanian legislators gorbachev 
said the republic could win independence in two years if it follows 
the procedure set out by moscow 
bush told the bbc the summit would give him a chance to to 
reaffirm the united states commitment to freedom and 
selfdetermination for lithuania 
he pointed out that the united states has never recognized the 
soviets 1940 incorporation of lithuania estonia and latvia which 
had been independent since the end of world war ii 
bush also said the soviet unions domestic problems should not 
affect talks on reducing nuclear weapons 
the summit is expected to seal an agreement on deep cuts in 
chemical and longrange nuclear weapons 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze struck a tentative agreement in moscow 
last week that calls for 30 to 35 percent reductions in longrange 
nuclear bombers missiles and submarines 
some critics have said the summit should have been postponed to 
pressure moscow into meeting the lithuanian demands but bush 
disagreed 
we talked to the soviet union when czechoslovakia was what we 
call a captive nation when hungary was and poland was were we 
sacrificing their freedom in discussing arms control with the 
soviet union now the world would clearly say of course you 
werent 
bush also said he would be talking with gorbachev about reducing 
nonnuclear forces and chemical arms he said german reunification 
and its implications for the north atlantic treaty organization 
will be discussed 
i think nato has a broader mission and i believe we can 
convince the soviets that that is in their interest and i 
think they dont need to have inordinate fears of a unified 
germany so we have to talk all this out with mr gorbachev he 
said in a separate us interview with britains independent 
television news 
the united states wants a unified germany to belong to the 
western nato military alliance but the soviets say both east and 
west bloc troops should remain at least until new security 
mechanisms are created

the uss iowa was conducting firing exercises 
some 330 miles off the coast of puerto rico when an explosion in 
its no 2 gun turret killed 47 sailors in the navys worst disaster 
since the vietnam war 
theories abounded about the cause of the april 19 1989 
explosion and naval investigators quickly centered on reports a 
falling out between two crew members might have sparked sabotage 
ultimately not even that theory could be proven for sure but 
the navy concluded that the most likely cause was a wrongful 
intentional act caused by gunners mate clayton hartwig who was 
among those killed in the explosion 
crew members congressional investigators and others criticized 
that finding and the navys decision thursday to reopen the 
investigation into the blast likely will add to the uncertainty 
also adding to the debate will be a general accounting office 
report due to be released friday that lawmakers said casts further 
doubt on the navys findings 
a scientist from sandia national laboratories in albuquerque 
nm hired by the gao to review physical evidence from the blast 
will testify friday before a senate armed services committee 
hearing on the new report 
rep mary rose oakar dohio the house member who represents 
the hartwig family said she was gratified that the navy was 
finally acknowledging that their first report was absolutely 
superficial and that they maligned and tried to destroy the 
reputation of a young killed seaman 
in the weeks and months after the explosion there were reports 
of crew incompetence poor leadership by officers and possible 
mishandling of the ships gunpowder stores during an overhaul 
the skipper capt fred p moosally complained to investigators 
that he took over a ship staffed with dopers marginal 
performers and rejects from other vessels investigators later 
cited moosally and two other officers for administrative 
deficiencies but said the problems were not linked to the explosion 
moosally speaking at his retirement ceremony on may 4 laid 
down a barrage of criticism of the navys investigation asserting 
that it was based on facts and opinions based on unsubstantiated 
thirdparty information unsubstantiated reports and supposition 
report after report surfaced of navy investigators blaming the 
blast on a crew member indentified later as hartwig with some of 
the leaks from investigators contending hartwig was depressed 
because of a falling out with fellow gunners mate kendall truitt 
because truitt rejected his homosexual advances 
still more reports said investigators believed there had been a 
homosexual relationship between hartwig and truitt something 
truitt denied in congressional testimony in which he faulted the 
navy investigation and said hartwig was no suicidal freak 
truitt and hartwigs family bitterly contested those 
allegations and the navy did not detail them in its official 
report 
angered with the speculative nature of the report congressional 
investigators said the navy should have issued inconclusive 
findings instead of saying hartwig probably caused the blast 
wouldnt it have been better off to say we dont know 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass said after one of several 
congressional hearings on the explosion i find it quite 
irresponsible that the navy would issue a report on a probable 
cause rather than have documented evidence that they can prove 
but the navy stood by its findings saying that while it could 
not say for certain that hartwig caused the explosion it had ruled 
out other possible causes including mechanical error or an 
accidental procedural error by a sailor 
the explosion in the center gun of no 2 turret the navy 
concluded was caused by the premature ignition of five bags of 
gunpower while the breech of the gun was open 
the explosion was the greatest tragedy for a ship that had been 
struck only once by enemy fire in two wars and 1988 patrol duty off 
the persian gulf 
launched in 1942 the iowa was active in world war ii and the 
korean war it then was mothballed for 24 years before being 
refitted for modern warfare as part of the reagan administrations 
military buildup 
it was the first of four sister ships that today are the only 
active battleships in the world brought out of mothballs in the 
early and middle 1980s because of their vast carrying capacity for 
new missiles thick armor to resist battle damage tremendous 
firepower to support the landing of troops substantial remaining 
service life and the fact that a surprising number of the worlds 
potential trouble spots are on a seacoast 
the 887foot iowa class battleships displace 58000 tons and 
carry nine 16inch guns in three turrets with 17inch armor on 
their faces side armor is 12 inches thick 
secondary armament was reduced from 20 5inch guns in 10 turrets 
to 12 guns in six to make room for missiles antiaircraft defense 
is provided by 3000 roundperminute phalanx 20mm guns firing 
rounds made of depleted uranium 
the ships were believed to have been capable of 35 knots with 
clean bottoms when young but additional weight today has slowed 
them slightly recent speed tests have showed them capable of 31 
knots almost 36 mph 
the modern equipment installed as part of the 400 million 
refitting allowed the ship to operate with a crew of 60 officers 
and 1500 enlisted men down from 117 officers and 1800 enlisted 
men aboard during world war ii 
the iowa and sister ship new jersey are to be mothballed again 
because of pentagon budget cutbacks its no 2 turret has not been 
fired since the explosion

president joaquin 
balaguer has eked out a close victory over a longtime leftist rival 
to win reelection according to results released thursday 
but the victory of the conservative president 83 and blind from 
glaucoma will not be assured until election officials review tally 
sheets for fraud and voting irregularities that process is 
expected to take several days 
the central electoral board on thursday released all the results 
from the 6663 polling stations in the may 16 balloting 
balaguer had 669063 votes and former president juan bosch an 
80yearold marxist who campaigned on a moderate platform had 
647369 
the review of tallies was ordered after bosch accused balaguer 
of fraud and threatened street demonstrations in the capital to 
prevent the elections from being stolen from the people 
election officials are reviewing tally sheets in the presence of 
international observers and the countrys four main political 
parties 
former president jimmy carter one of 30 international observers 
who monitored the elections recommended last week the vote count 
be verified 
carter is to return to this caribbean nation of 7 million people 
on friday to participate in the laborious tally survey 
he had said the review though short of a votebyvote recount 
would establish if fraud or honest errors were committed

an effort to save tens of thousands of 
military jobs by trimming funds for strategic weapons has been 
postponed until after next weeks ussoviet summit a lawmaker 
said thursday 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said a possible deal between congress and the pentagon 
which appeared possible on thursday had been put off until june 15 
defense secretary dick cheney said he cant take money out of 
strategic weapons before the summit aspin said 
president bush said thursday that his planned summit with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev would likely produce few signed 
agreements bush promised however to seek significant progress on 
arms talks 
bush said he had no problems with the agreement on reductions in 
longrange nuclear weapons secretary of state james a baker iii 
negotiated with moscow bush and gorbachev are to sign off on the 
broad details of that deal but the specifics still are being 
negotiated 
among the sources of funds proposed by aspin to boost the 
pentagons personnel accounts were the b2 stealth bomber 
strategic defense initiative mx nuclear missile and ssn21 seawolf 
attack submarine programs 
the pentagon had said it needed the money for personnel accounts 
by june 1 or pink slips would have to be sent out to uniformed men 
and women however aspin said the layoffs will not occur on june 
1 
earlier this year the pentagon asked for authority to move 852 
million from other accounts to personnel to avoid the dismissal of 
military personnel by october the cuts are required under the 
grammrudman budget cutting law 
such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the house and 
senate armed services committees and the house and senate 
appropriations committees 
but earlier this year aspin with the backing of house speaker 
thomas s foley dwash declined to bring the pentagons request 
before his committee 
president bush had the option of exempting military personnel 
from the grammrudman law but decided against it aspin charged 
that bush favored weapons over people 
the pentagon estimated that without the reprogramming authority 
44100 to 68200 military personnel would have to be fired by oct 
1 between 32500 and 32600 people would be frozen in their 
current jobs 57000 to 67000 promotions would be delayed and 
59900 to 115900 fewer men and women could be brought into the 
armed forces 
there are about 21 million uniformed personnel

new yorks beleaguered republican leaders 
struggled thursday toward a ticket possibly headed by a wall 
street economist to challenge the expected reelection bid of gov 
mario cuomo 
canadianborn pierre rinfret largely unknown in new york 
political circles emerged as the leading contender for the gop 
nomination after john loeb jr a former us ambassador to 
denmark took himself out of contention 
loeb a wealthy investment counselor whose name had surfaced 
only this week as a potential gubernatorial candidate said he 
planned to be a wholehearted supporter of rinfret 
nonetheless rinfret said through a spokeswoman that he hadnt 
decided whether to run 
and new york university professor herbert london the favorite 
of the states tiny but politically influential conservative party 
hadnt been ruled out of contention for the republican nomination 
democrat cuomo who has more than 7 million in his campaign 
warchest is expected to announce plans soon to run for a third 
fouryear term hes widely viewed as a potential contender for his 
partys 1992 presidential nomination 
state gop chairman j patrick barrett a former head of the avis 
car rental company has been searching for a cuomo challenger for 
almost a year only to be turned down by one republican after 
another 
new york sen alfonse damato last year likened a race against 
cuomo to a kamikaze mission 
with the republican state nominating convention starting next 
week barrett and other republican leaders began a frenzied round 
of meetings and telephone calls this week in search of a credible 
cuomo challenger state sen roy goodman the manhattan gop 
chairman suggested rinfret and loeb 
little known outside the financial community the two were 
interviewed wednesday by barrett 
i know only what ive read in the paper said westchester 
county gop chairman anthony colavita a former state chairman when 
asked about rinfret 
i dont know this guy and neither does anyone else said 
michael long chairman of the conservative party all i know is 
that he worked for two democratic presidents and is prochoice on 
abortion im not terribly comfortable with that 
however goodman said rinfret was a dynamite speaker who 
would be able to raise enough money to mount a credible challenge 
to cuomo 
rinfret an unpaid adviser to presidents kennedy johnson and 
nixon runs an economic consulting firm in new york city he lives 
in manhattan graduated from new york university and holds a 
doctorate in political economics from the university of dijon in 
france 
should rinfret be the gop candidate his campaign would likely 
focus on the state of new yorks economy and cuomos management 
the state is in its third straight year of budget deficits and 
cuomo is about to approve a record 18 billion taxincrease 
package as part of a new state budget

the navy reopened its investigation into the 
uss iowa explosion and ordered a halt to the firing of 16inch guns 
aboard all battleships thursday after the unexplained ignition 
of bags of powder during testing 
the new problems came during followup testing which the navy 
has been doing periodically as new theories were brought forward 
since the iowa blast and the navys review of it the service said 
last year the navy said the iowa explosion most probably 
was an intentional act by gunners mate 2nd class clayton hartwig 
of cleveland 
fortyseven sailors were killed in the april 19 1989 explosion 
during gunnery practice 
the service accused hartwig who was killed in the explosion of 
placing some type of detonation device between the gunpowder 
bags the service said hartwig was a loner who staged the blast 
because he was upset over the breakup of a friendship with another 
sailor but admitted it only had circumstantial evidence for its 
finding 
members of congress and others attacked that conclusion as 
unsupported by fact and called the navy faulted the investigation 
leading to it inadequate those critics said thursdays 
announcement showed they were right 
hartwigs father earl hartwig himself a navy gunners mate in 
world war ii said in cleveland this is what weve been saying 
all along my son is not guilty the navy was barking up the wrong 
tree 
this is a total victory said hartwigs sister kathy 
kubicina who has devoted her life to clearing her brothers name 
the iowas skipper at the time capt fred p moosally blasted 
the navys initial investigation in a speech at his may 4 
retirement ceremony 
moosally said it was conducted by people more concerned with 
getting it over with who used facts and opinions based on 
unsubstantiated thirdparty information unsubstantiated reports 
and supposition 
as a safety precaution the navy today suspended all live 
firing of battleship 16inch 50caliber guns until further 
notice the navy said 
the firing suspension is due to an unexplained ignition of 
16inch 50caliber powder bags during navy testing at naval 
weapons station in dahlgren va today the statement said 
pentagon sources said the navy was informed several weeks ago 
about test results conducted by the sandia national laboratories in 
albuquerque nm which indicated that the iowa explosion could 
have been caused by the overramming of the gunpowder bags 
the general accounting office the congressional investigating 
agency hired sandia to evaluate the testing done by the navy in 
its initial investigation 
senate armed services chairman sen sam nunn dga had 
requested the followup testing said navy spokesman cmdr mark 
baker 
representatives from sandia helped perform new tests thursday 
in the new experiment five 96pound bags filled with gunpowder 
pellets were dropped vertically with weights on top of them 
recreating the tremendous forces that ram the bags into the chamber 
of a 16inch naval rifle 
they were trying to recreate the conditions for a fast 
ram said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity on 
the 18th try they got a detonation 
because of the explosion at dahlgren the secretary of the 
navy has directed the reopening and continuation of the uss iowa 
investigation to incorporate the additional test data the navys 
statement said 
stability of the powder was one of the main points of contention 
during congressional hearings into the navys earlier 
investigation some family members contended that poor storage of 
the powder had made it unstable it was not immediately known 
whether powder in the new tests was in similar condition 
dahlgren is located in the extreme northeast corner of virginia 
about 20 miles southeast of washington 
nunn wrote the navy on may 14 protesting the inactivity by the 
service in light of a may 11 report from sandia according to a 
copy of the letter made available by the source 
the lab had conducted tests on 8inch guns which showed that 
when an overram occurred with powder pellets in their bags 
oriented both horizontally and vertically there was enough 
friction to cause an explosion 
nunns letter objected to the navys conclusion that the tests 
were not relevant because they were not performed on 16inch guns 
he asked that the service actively and expeditiously conduct 
further tests 
the navys announcement came as the gao was scheduled to release 
a report on the initial navy investigation on friday 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said the report apparently 
spurred the navy to action 
its obvious that they know whats coming in the gao report 
and are trying to do that which weve been requesting them to do 
for some time he said they are in an embarrassing position 
rep les aspin dwis and rep nicholas mavroules dmass 
said the new test development further erodes the navys theory 
that clayton hartwig committed mass murder and suicide in the iowa 
turret 
but sen john warner rva a former secretary of the navy and 
senior republican on the armed services committee said it is 
important to stress that we not leap to judgment it would be 
wrong in my judgment to raise expectations and further cause 
emotional stress to the familes before the navy completes a 
planned two weeks of additional tests 
congressional panels in releasing an assessment of the navys 
inquiry faulted both the investigation and the conclusions 
excess of certitude 
two subcommittees of the house armed services committee 
investigations and defense policy said they found four major flaws 
in the navy inquiry the structure of the investigation technical 
tests police work and psychological analysis 
rear adm richard milligan who oversaw the technical and 
criminal study testified last year that additional technical tests 
conducted since he issued his report found unique foreign 
material on the projectile from the exploding gun barrel that 
would not have been present during a normal firing 
tests identified the material as iron wires coated with calcium 
chlorine and oxygen which would be produced by some types of 
nonelectronic explosive devices milligan said then 
rep mary rose oakar dohio who represents the hartwig family 
and who has a copy of the gao report said thursday it concludes 
that based on scientific fact not on supposition the gun did 
not contain the foreign devices the navy said it did 
all four of the nations four battleships are now in port the 
uss iowa and the uss wisconsin at norfolk va and the uss new 
jersey and the uss missouri at long beach calif 
the iowa and the new jersey are to be retired this year to save 
money and the iowa will not be repaired beforehand 
the gun turret where the explosion occurred aboard the iowa has 
not been refired although the other guns aboard the other 
battleships have been tested since the explosion and found to be 
safe the navy has said 
unattributed reports during the first navy investigation tied 
hartwigs alleged suicide to despondency over the rejection of his 
homosexual advances by a shipmate kendall truitt truitt and 
hartwigs family have bitterly protested those reports 
in miami truitts lawyer ellis rubin said he was pleased with 
thursdays news and his client stands ready to be a witness in 
the new investigation and hopes this is the final step to restoring 
his good name

the father of the gunners mate implicated by the navy in the 
explosion that killed 47 sailors on the battleship iowa said 
thursday the navys decision to reopen an investigation into the 
blast exonerates his son 
this is what we have been saying all along my son is not 
guilty the navy was barking up the wrong tree said earl hartwig 
a navy report on the april 19 1989 gunturret explosion said 
gunners mate 2nd class clayton hartwig of cleveland most 
probably caused the explosion intentionally 
the navys findings issued sept 7 concluded that hartwig was 
disgruntled over his treatment in promotions and assignments 
the navy said thursday it was reopening the investigation after 
the unexplained ignition of bags of powder earlier in the day 
during testing at a naval center in dahlgren va of theories 
offered by sandia national laboratory in new mexico no was injured 
in thursdays blast 
families of other iowa victims also hailed the navys decision 
i am happy to hear they were open enough to do that said 
darleen schelin from her home in el toro calif her son geoffrey 
scott schelin died in the explosion 
the general accounting office congress watchdog agency is to 
release a report friday on the initial navy investigation and 
conclusions based on research at sandia 
hartwigs father said the pending release of the report forced 
the navy to reassess its earlier conclusion 
it seems awful strange that the navy pulled this now that the 
lab findings are coming out said earl hartwig who was a navy 
gunners mate in world war ii 
kathy kubicina clayton hartwigs sister who has devoted her 
time to clearing her brothers name called the navys announcement 
thursday total victory 
id like to hope that this will clear the doubts in anybodys 
mind about what happened aboard the iowa she said from a pay 
phone on the pennsylvania turnpike while en route to washington 
dc for a senate armed services subcommittee hearing on the iowa 
blast 
this is a tremendous sense of relief that we may finally get 
to the bottom of this said nancy lewis of northville mich who 
lost her son richard in the explosion and was traveling with ms 
kubicina to washington 
ms kubicina has said green fragments found in some of iowa 
corpses would prove the gunpowder was old and more likely to 
explode the gunpowder on the iowa had been stored on barges in 
extreme heat and had started to turn green a sign of 
deterioration she said 
sharon ziegler whose husband reginald owen ziegler died in 
the explosion also said the navy should look at the gunpowder used 
my husband complained about the powder and he was upset that 
there never was enough money to keep the equipment up she said 
from her home in port gibson ny i think it was an accident 
waiting to happen 
mrs schelin said she hoped the new investigation will be 
unbiased 
but it has reestablished our faith that the navy would do the 
right thing she said

the senate voted thursday to bar the execution 
of mentally retarded individuals convicted of capital crimes under 
federal law but leaders gave up hope of finishing work on an 
omnibus crime bill this week 
for gods sake if you acknowledge you should not put children 
to death acknowledge that you should not put to death the mentally 
retarded sen joseph r biden jr ddel said as the senate 
debated the crime bill 
senators defeated 5938 an amendment that would have limited the 
death penalty protection for the mentally retarded to those who 
dont know the difference between right and wrong 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine had hoped to 
complete action on the anticrime bill before fridays scheduled 
start of a 10day recess but he abandoned that idea after 271 
amendments were proposed 
theres simply no way to proceed with action on this bill when 
we face at least the possibility of several hundred amendments 
mitchell said 
lawmakers said the raft of amendments could stall the bill 
minority leader bob dole rkan said it seems to me there is 
great pressure from certain groups not to invoke cloture limit 
debate and to kill the bill 
the senate set a june 5 vote on whether to limit debate 
if you dont get cloture i think you bring it the bill 
down biden told reporters if you dont get cloture you just 
declare the republicans killed the crime bill 
the vote on the issue of the death penalty for the mentally 
retarded came as president bush urged congress to approve a good 
strong anticrime bill but restated his opposition to curbs on 
semiautomatic assault weapons upheld wednesday by the senate 
also thursday the senate 
dropped from the bill a provision to allow death row inmates to 
base appeals on statistics showing a racial discriminatory pattern 
within the jurisdiction they were sentenced 
sen bob graham dfla one of the critics said the plan would 
have the practical consequence of repealing capital punishment 
because no jurisdiction can meet the standards of this 
proposal 
reversed a wednesday decision and adopted 5246 a stringent 
provision designed to cut short appeals by death row inmates that 
can drag on for a decade or longer 
the move was designed to cut short habeas corpus appeals 
such appeals are filed after all others are exhausted and determine 
whether trials and sentencings were carried out in a constitutional 
manner 
critics of the proposal to protect the mentally retarded from 
execution said virtually every defendant facing a death sentence 
would claim to be mentally retarded sen orrin hatch rutah 
called it a soft liberal approach 
sen alan simpson rwyo said that as a prosecutor a suspect 
who claimed to have mental problems told him he enjoyed raping and 
beating a woman 
he said the suspect was later released and sliced his wife up 
into 83 sections these are people who are human only in the 
sense of anatomical essence and they are bums 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said he had strong feelings on 
the issue because he has a mentally retarded sister 
this is about the only democracy in the world that has the 
death penalty and were arguing about whether were going to 
execute the mentally retarded that says something about our 
society kennedy said 
the supreme court ruled in 1989 that mentally retarded people 
may be executed in capital cases senators said the courts have 
held that an iq of 70 is the dividing line used to identify the 
mentally retarded 
the senates bill would apply only to federal cases and thus 
would not reverse the supreme courts ruling as it applies to 
capital punishment cases in state courts 
earlier bush told reporters at the white house that he sent a 
crime bill to the congress and would like to see it enacted as a 
law enforcement bill 
lets get a good strong anticrime bill and then we can have a 
debate about what they want to do on automatic weapons issues 
bush said the automatic weapon part does not have my support 
and i wish the congress would stop adding matters of this nature 
there is no similar legislation on the house calendar 
lawmakers said in the aftermath of wednesdays vote that the gun 
issue might not be settled 
weve known for a long time we were going to have to deal with 
antigun legislation said dole of kansas and i dont regard 
wednesdays vote as the final word

after more than a decade of stalemate 
congress is close to sending sweeping clean air legislation to 
president bush 
the house by a 40121 margin approved pollution controls late 
wednesday on factories automobiles and electric power plants most 
of the most difficult disputes were worked out behind closed doors 
with little floor debate 
the senate passed a similar bill in early april and a conference 
committee is expected to work out differences perhaps as early as 
this summer 
wednesdays vote represented the first time in 13 years that the 
house acted to revamp the 1970 federal clean air law which 
environmentalists for years have said is inadequate to rid cities 
of dirty air or protect the public from toxic chemicals

all in the name of science 24 young men sat 
around a college dormitory for 3 months and watched tv played 
cards and ate 
and ate and ate 
when it was over they had provided some of the clearest 
evidence yet of one of natures injustices some people can overeat 
without putting on much weight but for others every extra calorie 
goes straight to the waistline 
moreover the study suggested a reason why and it strengthened 
the case that heredity plays a major role in whether people get fat 
it seems that some peoples bodies store extra calories mostly 
as fat while others tend to make new muscle and because 
manufacturing lean tissue is not a very energy efficient process 
the muscle makers put on less weight

way of an arms control agreement the projected star of the big

him of giving too much ground in his negotiations last week in

there is very strong support for this agreement among the

good agreement that is very much in the national security interests

the bush administration is winning praise for 
finally issuing a realistic assessment of how much it will cost to 
clean up the savings and loan industry already the largest 
government bailout in history 
but some democratic critics are questioning why it took so long 
to come up with an accurate figure and wonder why the government 
isnt doing more to prosecute the highflyers who created the mess 
in the first place 
the administration also left unanswered how to pay for the 
higher bailout cost leaving that question for the current round of 
budget negotiations congressional and administration 
budgetwriters are looking for ways to reduce next years federal 
deficit to the 64 billion required by the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
responding to demands for better figures on the sampl issue the 
administration on wednesday released a new estimate that the 
government will need to borrow between 90 billion and 130 billion 
to clean up the sampl mess

the rev j lee simmons isnt sure his 
operation rescue followers are willing to ante up in their fight to 
stop abortion since the us supreme court raised the stakes 
the high court monday upheld a ban on operation rescue 
demonstrations aimed at preventing women from entering new york 
cityarea abortion clinics a week earlier the court left intact a 
ban on operation rescue blockades in atlanta 
theres a small handful determined to carry on no matter 
what said simmons head of operation rescue in central new york 
but for the average guy in an office or the homemaker with 
children the price is getting too high to pay i own a house i 
have four children and a ministry i cant afford big fines and 
long jail sentences not many people can 
the rulings may force operation rescue to change its tactics but 
are not expected to have a significant bearing on the abortion

the diehard karen rebels have been 
squeezed into shrinking frontier enclaves and may be down to the 
last battles of their 41yearold fight for autonomy 
it has been a long hard march for one of burmas many ethnic 
minorities most of it backward at the beginning in the late 
1940s karen troops swept through burmas major cities and even 
penetrated to the outskirts of rangoon the capital 
in the past two years the army has overrun most of the karen 
bases along the thai border and sent 28000 refugees fleeing across 
the frontier 
thailand eager to exploit burmas rich forests has struck 
deals with the government at the expense of the rebels hundreds of 
fighters have died on both sides in fierce jungle combat sometimes 
handtohand 
among the last karen strongholds is the border town of 
manerplaw capital of territory the karen call kawtoolei 
manerplaw probably one of the worlds most idyllic guerrilla 
bases sits on the moei river at the foot of miststreaked hills 
its neat woodandthatch buildings house 12 government 
departments of the karen national union including foreign affairs 
fisheries and mining karen leaders claim to command 10000 troops 
and govern 1 million civilians 
the karen fighters and a dozen other rebellious ethnic 
minorities with which they are allied do not seek independence but 
greater political and cultural autonomy 
if you consider it historically it is the worst situation we 
have faced but it doesnt mean the end of the karen revolution 
said ba thein general secretary of the karen national union 
he said the karen were switching to more classicstyle guerrilla 
warfare and would have little trouble operating in areas of eastern 
burma dominated by the karen minority a mobile headquarters 
would be organized if manerplaw fell to the burmese he said in an 
interview 
ba thein also expressed hope for internal political change in 
burma 
we are not alone he said all the people in burma are 
struggling for freedom we believe that if democracy comes all 
the ethnic minority problems with be solved 
burmas military which brutally crushed a prodemocracy 
uprising in 1988 has shown remarkable tenacity 
the loss of border bases has greatly reduced the karen national 
unions income from taxes levied on frontier smuggling which was 
used to buy weapons 
in contrast the 200000member burmese military has restocked 
its arsenal with funds from teaklogging concessions granted to 
thai businessmen 
burmese control of the border is now in the interest of powerful 
thais and rebel officers say some thaiburmese military 
cooperation has occurred 
the logging has been the death knell of the karen said a 
knowledgeable western observer in bangkok he noted that earlier 
friendly and mutually advantageous ties between the thais and karen 
had helped sustain the insurgency 
what some sympathetic westerners and thais have called the 
sellout of the karen fits a historical pattern 
although the karen have lived in what is now burma at least as 
long as the burmans they have been suppressed and looked down upon 
as savages and wild cattle of the hills 
the karen fought bravely alongside the allies in world war ii 
while a projapanese government sat in rangoon but promises of 
some autonomy were broken when burma gained independence from 
britain in 1947 
after the early successes of their insurgency the tide turned 
against the karen rebels and they were gradually forced into the 
border region 
there has been incompetence and some corruption among the aging 
rebel leaders who have not conducted a real guerrilla war and 
disparities in power and education between the christian leaders 
and their followers most of whom are buddhist or animist 
in 1984 the government stepped up its campaign and three years 
later announced it would destroy the karen national union within 
two years that has not happened but two words often heard when 
the rebels discuss the future are dark and bleak 
i am 63 and have fought all my life ba thein said my 
children have now joined the revolution perhaps the next 
generation will also have to struggle

tom cruise who last month urged earth day 
celebrants in washington to help save the planet has dropped out 
as televisions capt planet a starname setback but noooo 
problem 
capt planet and the planeteers ted turners cartoon 
ecoseries is pressing on says barbara v pyle the executive in 
charge of the 26episode 78 million project to alert kids to 
dangers to the environment 
cruise was to be the voice of capt planet a greenhaired 
ecohero who can be summoned by five youngsters of different races 
and nations to fight various villains ruining the earth 
alas the stars busy film schedule just does not permit him 
to be involved in a series production says pyle he was 
putting us too far behind and so we lovingly and sadly parted 
ways 
but production continues as does a search for the stars 
replacement 
previously announced stars such as sting martin sheen and meg 
ryan still remain as the voices of such ecovillains as zarm sly 
sludge and dr blight 
and whoopi goldberg a show spokeswoman says still is on as the 
voice of a central character gaia the mother earth who gives the 
kids on the show magic rings containing the powers of earth wind 
fire water and heart 
the shows are going to start popping off the cookie sheet in 
july says pyle a breezy oklahoman and former freelance 
photographer who joined turners atlantabased cable empire when it 
was just a small one back in 1980 
the halfhour series whose basic idea was conceived by turner 
and developed by pyle and seven others will premiere with 
commercials on two fronts on local stations and turners tbs 
superstation 
turner officials say the show has been sold to more than 100 
stations for broadcast during kidcartoon hours on saturday 
mornings tbs serving more than 50 million homes by cable will 
air it sunday mornings 
pyle met turner while working for time magazine covering the 
1980 americas cup races in which he and his sailing boat 
participated 
he hired her she says upon learning that she shared his 
feelings on environmental issues even though she knew nothing 
about tv thanks to him she now may now be the only environmental 
executive at a television network 
since january she has been tbss vice president of 
environmental policy before that she made more than 16 
documentaries for tbs on various global issues many of them on the 
problems posed by overpopulation 
it was a tough road says pyle who entered the 
oftenillogical world of tv armed with a masters degree in logic 
from new york university 
for a long time people thought i was a real nut she says 
and they thought that my programming was going to bury the 
station with all this dogooder stuff nobody wanted to see 
she isnt bothered that some cynics may say the same of capt 
planet that it may not get the urchin audience at which it is 
aimed and that messages disguised as cartoon entertainment just 
wont lure the kids 
she submits that the show will work a motion seconded by a 
veteran critic of the networks saturday morning kid shows peggy 
charren founder and president of the watchdog group action for 
childrens television 
i think its a nifty idea charren says of capt planet 
its very much designed for that audience game that 
broadcasters and advertisers play but it has some meaning and 
its designed to compete with all the junk 
pyle grumbles goodnaturedly when asked what its like going 
from documentaries to the world of cartoons 
ive got chronic back pains from being a desk jockey and 
flying back and forth from la she says 
give me the bush any day but its a sacrifice well worth 
making for the effect its going to have

in a city where the show usually goes on 
regardless the west end theater has been sponsoring an unusual 
number of shortlived flops 
the latest casualties are king a musical based on the life 
of the slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr and a 
clockwork orange inspired by the anthony burgess novel both 
will close on june 2 with a combined loss of more than 5 million 
producers blamed poor attendance and bad reviews although 
critics in london are generally much less influential than in new 
york 
a spokesman for king called the reviews unseemly and 
damaging 
these closings follow the premature demise this month of such 
diverse west end entries as never the sinner john logans play 
about the leopold and loeb murder case in 1920s chicago look 
look michael frayns first new play since benefactors in 
1984 and bus stop a revival of the william inge play 
starring model jerry hall 
the musical someone like you with petula clark shut on a 
thursday afternoon april 26 after a scant five weeks when 
producer harold fielding was forced into liquidation 
normally london shows must announce their closings a minimum of 
two weeks before the final performance the sort of overnight death 
knells so prevalent on broadway rarely happen here 
the fate of look look which closed may 12 after a 
monthlong run was a particular surprise frayn is one of 
britains most respected dramatists its star was stephen fry a 
popular local tv personality but in an interview with londons 
sunday times frayn said he understood the critical reaction 
i actually feel embarrassed for the critics he said of the 
comedy which lost its 420000 outlay 
i dont think the play failed because it is too intelligent 
but because it isnt intelligent enough 
clare fox producer of never the sinner said her show was 
bedeviled by such english anomalies as a heat wave and a riot 
we did open in the middle of a riot which is very unbritish 
as you know said fox 
referring to the antitax demonstration on march 31 which 
filled much of the theater district with rampaging protesters she 
said i think it frightened people everybodys box office 
dropped away 
fox said never the sinner was playing to 25percent 
capacity half the breakeven figure it cost 320000 
so far 1990 has fielded only two substantial commercial hits 
peter ustinovs oneman show which was extended one month through 
may 27 at the theater royal haymarket and alan ayckbourns new 
play man of the moment 
otherwise londons hottest tickets continue to be such musical 
holdovers as miss saigon aspects of love the phantom of 
the opera and les miserables

he once was the man of the hour the 
latest strongmen installed by the army to lead guatemala out of 
corruption insurrection and bloodshed 
gen efrain rios montt a bornagain christian with a 
charismatic style presided over times of masked tribunals and 
firing squads of army massacres that shocked the world 
when a coup deposed him in 1983 after 16 months as president 
rios montt seemed consigned to political obscurity 
his ambition like his faith has been resurrected and he is 
running for president as a civilian rios montt is a serious 
contender scoring high in the polls a candidate of crisis 
five years of democracy have not brought clean effective 
government or ended violence and human rights abuses street crime 
is rampant drug trafficking on the rise the economy unraveling 
it is a moral crisis an ethical crisis a failure of hope 
said juan luis bosch a leading businessman people put their 
hope in a democratic government but hope has become 
disillusionment 
things seem to be spinning out of control and rios montt offers 
to put them right he is a lawandorder candidate with an old 
testament style stern and paternal 
guatemala needs a man of character a man who knows and 
enforces the law the 63yearold retired brigadier general said 
in an interview not a dictator a man of law 
rios montts law was harsh 
he imposed a state of siege and created special tribunals where 
masked judges tried hundreds of people for crimes including 
sabotage possession of explosives and the sale of weapons to 
people deemed subversive 
only 15 people were ultimately sentenced to death but it was 
a great scandal because we shot five when the pope was here rios 
montt said 
pope john paul ii made a personal plea for clemency during his 
1983 central america tour 
it would have been easier to shoot them and just dump them in 
the trash but that wouldnt have been justice rios montt said 
curtly closing the subject 
during his presidency the army continued a vicious 
counterinsurgency campaign to destroy any potential base of support 
for leftist guerrillas among the peasants 
it led to the gravest violations of human rights including 
the destruction and sacking of entire villages and massacres of the 
inhabitants the human rights commission of the organization of 
american states said in 1983 
now an almost nostalgic glow seems to bathe rios montts reign 
the worldwide condemnation of human rights abuses seems forgotten 
you talk to the average person here about human rights and it 
means getting on a bus and not being robbed a western diplomat 
said that is what makes rios montts message so powerful 
people speak of how his stern measures seemed to work how the 
armys scorchedearth campaign in the countryside dimmed the 
leftist insurgency how city streets were safe and official 
corruption waned 
he is seen as an upright man a person of principles and 
order someone who will end the violence and corruption said 
fernando hurtado deputy attorney general for human rights he is 
someone who in a time of crisis stresses values 
central americas most populous nation seems caught in a time 
warp turn on television and there is rios montt again talking 
about law and order the family and clean government just as he 
did in evangelistic sunday homilies as president 
more than half a dozen candidates are seeking the presidency 
encouraged by the vulnerability of the incumbent christian 
democrats who are widely seen as corrupt and inept 
rios montt is running as an independent political observers say 
they detect little solid support for him in the two most powerful 
segments of guatemalan society the army and business 
i have the support of the people he said in the interview 
that is what matters 
the most serious obstacle to his candidacy is a constitution 
that appears to bar former dictators heads of de facto 
governments from becoming president 
rios montt says the 1985 constitution is not retroactive and he 
will run despite an adverse advisory opinion from the 
constitutional court the opinion was requested by the legislature 
and is not binding 
the former general predicted his followers will start a civil 
uprising if election authorities refuse to let him register when 
they meet in june to set an election date and register candidates 
it will be the people not the army he said an army 
uprising doesnt interest me coups dont interest me 
he grabbed a wellthumbed copy of the constitution with key 
passages highlighted in yellow ink or underlined in red and 
thumped a clause he says makes such an uprising legal 
it says here that people have the right to defend their 
rights and they have a right to vote for me he said 
his interest in constitutional law is relatively new one of his 
first acts after a march 1982 coup put him in power was to revoke 
the 1965 constitution suspend political activity and cancel 
election laws 
rios montt a member of the church of the word based in 
california says he does not intend to revive the special tribunals 
or military rule instead he proposes an extensive system of 
locally elected judges 
no more tanks no more planes no more soldiers he said 
more justice 
his human rights record could make him unacceptable to many 
other governments if he becomes president 
publicly the united states is neutral privately us 
officials say aid might be cut if rios montt wins 
rios montt said his election could provoke a us invasion or 
assassination attempt 
do something like panama shoot me end everything he said 
spitting out the words 
rios montts administration was the last but one in a 30year 
line of military or militarydominated governments that began with 
a ussponsored coup in 1954 
he dismisses criticism of his armys counterinsurgency campaign 
echoing former president reagans comment in 1982 that the general 
got a bum rap 
they blamed me for what lucas did but they knew i had an 
honest government he said referring to his predecessor gen

solidarity leaders who worked together for 
a decade to rid poland of communism now find their unity rent by 
differences over the pace and nature of change 
the spectacle of this war at the top to use lech walesas 
phrase has dismayed activists some are choosing sides and others 
hope to make peace between the factions 
walesa who led the 1980 strike in which solidarity was born 
brought the longrumored tensions into the open in april 
his method was public criticism aimed at the government of prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki and the parliamentary caucus led by 
bronislaw geremek both are intellectuals and solidarity advisers 
who owe their positions to the shipyard electrician from gdansk 
walesa said he had been silent too long he accused the 
government of advocating a steered democracy one that limits 
dissent because it thinks it has all the answers he said the 
communist system was being dismantled too slowly and people were 
dissatisfied 
walesa feels the mood of the people very well and the people 
are getting impatient especially for political changes said 
zdzislaw najder whom walesa has named chairman of solidaritys 
national citizens committee 
mazowieckis defenders say walesa is motivated by personal 
restlessness and an ambition to be president they say his 
criticism threatens to stir unrest when the government needs calm 
to obtain western investment and accomplish difficult economic 
reforms 
no reasonable person can see any monopolization of power 
aleksander malachowski a solidarity member of parliament said in 
an interview but added that some demagogues sought excuses to 
attack the government 
very often in walesas statements you can see reflections of 
this demagoguery malachowski said he probably does not 
realize it 
the dispute seems to signal a turning away from the 1989 round 
table accord in which solidarity agreed to a transitional stage 
of coexistence with the communists who still held most of the 
power 
with the collapse of communist control throughout eastern 
europe poland has become a rarity where former party leaders 
retain titular positions of power including the presidency and 
high posts in the military police and parliament 
they have kept their places largely by not disturbing the 
decisions of mazowiecki and the solidarity parliamentary caucus 
walesa speaks for those who want to end the artificial 
arrangement as quickly as possible mazowieckis allies worry about 
upsetting a balance that has worked so well 
while walesa says the intellectuals misled him some of them 
hint he is losing his renowned political instincts 
you are making mistakes in many areas foreign affairs 
specialist kazimierz wojcicki lectured the solidarity chairman may 
13 in a stormy session of the citizens committee 
you use terminology that confuses us he said you start a 
presidential campaign and then retract it you make us all 
nervous at a moment when our economic reforms are entering a key 
stage 
there also has been sniping between the daily gazeta wyborcza 
and weekly tygodnik solidarnosc two newspapers founded by 
solidarity they are edited respectively by adam michnik an 
intellectual perhaps best known for his letters from prison 
and jaroslaw kaczynski a walesa loyalist 
who will succeed president wojciech jaruzelski has become the 
subject of sometimes acrimonious debate it is assumed the former 
communist party chief will have to step down before the formal end 
of his term in 1995 
walesa clearly wants the job and kaczynski has organized a 
political group called the center alliance to support the candidacy 
from the other side suggestions are being circulated sometimes 
even printed that walesa is too impulsive and does not have the 
learning or manners the presidency requires 
malachowski and some others in parliament and the government say 
mazowiecki who was little known until walesa made him prime 
minister in august is a better presidential candidate 
how could people who fought and suffered so long together with 
the notion of solidarity as their highest value fall out so 
soon after their hour of triumph 
in part the dissolution of their common foe the communist 
party has released various conflicts within solidarity 
leftright workerintellectual warsawprovinces 
now the most difficult moment has come because we dont have 
anyone to fight against actress maja komorowska said at the may 
13 meeting 
we are all victims of 45 years of communist rule and of the 
lack of democracy said najder who recently returned from exile 
we know how to fight our enemies but we dont know how to 
coexist as allies 
he also said in an interview he felt the differences between 
walesa and mazowiecki were blown out of proportion 
we have democracy but when there are differences of opinion 
people are aghast he said if somebody criticizes the 
government they think he or she wants to bring down the 
government its absurd 
at the same citizens committee meeting where he spoke of the 
war at the top walesa praised the government and the 
solidarity leadership in parliament najder said 
walesa said his criticism was meant to help the government by 
providing a safety vent for growing public frustration 
according to najder the dispute developed because walesa is in 
close touch with public feelings and wants to create a more open 
political game by opposing monopolistic tendencies in 
parliament 
he said government leniency about pensions for former officials 
and its mild attitude on recovering property taken by the communist 
party were incomprehensible to some solidarity supporters 
the government also may be guilty of excessive sensitivity 
najder said the returned exile a former director of radio free 
europes polish section was sentenced to death in absentia by the 
communist regime 
malachowski who wants walesa to continue as solidarity chairman 
instead of becoming polands president said years of joint 
struggle had forged links among solidarity activists that 
occasional arguments could not break 
mrs komorowska the actress said the relationsship between 
walesa and the intellectuals should be like a marriage and 
observed 
it is a bad marriage where the couple does not sit down at the 
table in the evening and say to each other what is painful

the economy is in shambles republics erupt in 
explosive ethnic quarrels others try to secede comrades squabble 
over what is to be done and do nothing 
yet mikhail s gorbachev not only survives but is championed 
around the world as a hero of epic proportion 
in the five years of his reign he has ended the cold war taken 
the first steps toward nuclear disarmament pulled his army out of 
afghanistan and begun the withdrawal of soviet troops from foreign 
soil tens of millions of his countrymen and millions more in the 
former soviet satellite states of eastern europe have been freed 
from totalitarian rule 
i think he is more popular abroad than he is at home 
observed a soviet teacher who recently returned from her first trip 
to the west 
indeed gorbachev is no hero to many soviets understandably 
preoccupied with the issues of everyday life the food and ordinary 
goods they cant buy the critical housing shortage that denies 
them simple comfort and privacy the rising crime rate and ethnic 
strife that make them fearful for their families and meager 
possessions 
he has pleaded futilely with lithuanian officials not to declare 
their independence and has been jeered to his fating market forces revamp 
the economy it is said that poland 
shortened the painful transition period of high unemployment and 
runaway inflation by moving swiftly after the fall of the communist 
government there 
but the soviet plan to try something similar leaked to the 
press touching off an outcry from a fearful public gorbachev and 
other top officials later denied they would attempt such a radical 
move 
last week gorbachevs advisers approved a milder reform plan 
that envisions a doubling of food prices an 82 percent rise in 
energy costs and an average 43 percent rise in retail prices but 
only if the public supports it in a national referendum 
absent public support perhaps we will have to resort to 
roundtable discussions to devise a plan that would be supported 
first deputy premier yuri maslyukov said at a news conference 
he said the government was not proposing shock therapy 
changes because such reforms could throw 40 million people out of 
work and would lead the country to the edge of an economic 
crash 
some soviet citizens reacted with apathy to the announcement 
others with emotion a 65yearold woman said i have been 
suffering all my life another woman said the reforms would make 
food so expensive that ill have to put my teeth away on a 
shelf 
gorbachev is in a tough position as head of the communist party 
said vyacheslav shostakovsky rector of the higher party school in 
moscow in the party everyone from the right wing from the 
left wing is criticizing him 
but shostakovsky a leading member of the democratic platform 
group that is pushing within the party for faster reform added 
that as president gorbachev retains the support of a broad 
centrist element in the country despite the sharp criticism of him 
from the more radical wings of his own party 
a peasant by birth and a product of the communist system 
gorbachev has demonstrated repeatedly he is quite capable of taking 
one position based on traditional ideology then abandoning it in 
the face of popular discontent he did that in being converted to 
legalization of private ownership of factories the means of 
production that classical marxists insisted were tools of 
exploitation unless held by the state 
it sometimes even appears he has helped fuel the publics demand 
for change after stubbornly resisting calls for a multiparty 
system he accepted the idea then gave at least tacit support to a 
huge demonstration through downtown moscow to increase pressure on 
the party leadership to go along 
while calling constantly for perestroika or economic 
restructuring gorbachev often defines the debate with radicals on 
both sides opposed to him he thus makes adoption of his reform 
proposal appear to be the centrist position 
through adroit political maneuver gorbachev now sits 
comfortably atop both the party and the government his adversaries 
on the right led by yegor k ligachev a spokesman for doctrinaire 
communism no longer hold positions of power his most vocal critic 
on the left communist maverick boris n yeltsin is waging a 
campaign for the presidency of the russian republic which would 
give him a new soapbox but little administrative authority over the 
vast territory that forms the largest of the unions 15 constituent 
republics 
after giving in to popular demands that the communist party 
surrender its monopoly gorbachev led a drive this spring to 
legalize competing parties and simultaneously establish a strong 
presidency a post he then handily won for himself in a clear 
demonstration of political clout 
as the party inevitably loses its command over daily life 
gorbachev can continue to rule from his new power base at the top 
of the government 
the president and his supporters are fond of saying there is no 
alternative to perestroika for now at least the same might be 
said of perestroikas champion 
the country cant do without gorbachev now said lidya 
sharlai who raises pigs on a collective farm outside moscow in 
a few years perhaps but right now there is no one else

when nikita khrushchev heard hed been invited 
to camp david he was afraid it might be the kind of a place where 
stray dogs were sent to die 
but the soviets have learned a lot about america since 
khrushchev and dwight eisenhower forged the shortlived spirit of 
camp david in 1959 
mikhail gorbachev accepted president bushs invitation to the 
hideaway with no apparent misgivings the soviet president will be 
there for a few hours saturday before flying to minneapolis 
gorbachev will be the third kremlin leader to visit the 
presidential retreat in marylands catoctin mountains leonid 
brezhnev met there with richard nixon who found brezhnev a 
dangerous driver on the camps narrow winding roads 
since it opened as shangrila in 1942 the presidential retreat 
has been visited by several foreign leaders including british 
prime ministers from winston churchill to margaret thatcher 
churchill visited franklin d roosevelt there summing up the 
retreat as in principle a log cabin with all modern 
improvements 
it was eisenhower who introduced the rustic retreat to 
highprofile world politics by inviting khrushchev to meet with him 
there 
i couldnt for the life of me find out what this camp david 
was the soviet leader wrote in his memoirs 
after the bolshevik revolution in 1917 he said the new 
kremlins leaders had been invited to a place called princess 
island where stray dogs were sent to die 
i was afraid camp david was the same sort of place where 
people who were mistrusted would be kept in quarantine he wrote 
not even our embassy in washington could tell us for certain what 
camp david was 
after finding out pravda told its readers that the mountain 
compound would seem to have been created for fruitful reflections 
by nature itself 
the talks resulted in an agreement to hold a fourpower summit 
in paris but what was called the spirit of camp david quickly 
foundered on revelations of us spy flights over soviet territory 
and the paris summit was canceled 
khrushchev and eisenhower watched a western movie at the 
presidential lodge in the evening after the soviet leader told the 
president that he shared ikes fondness for such films 
british prime minister harold macmillan visiting the camp 
earlier the same year also had been treated to a western the 
big country 
it lasted three hours he wrote in his diary it was 
inconceivably banal 
french president charles de gaulle and leaders of canada 
australia indonesia and other countries also have visited the 
camp which is 1800 feet up in the mountains and 60 miles 
northwest of washington 
when brezhnev came to the retreat in 1973 nixon presented him 
with a dark blue lincoln continental donated by the manufacturer 
ford motor co 
as nixon told the story in his memoirs brezhnev quickly jumped 
into the drivers seat and invited his host to join him by the 
time the soviet leader got the car up over 50 miles an hour on 
roads posted for 15 nixon was shouting at him to slow down 
during the carter administration the retreat was the scene of 
the 13day conference that produced the camp david accords which 
led to the israelieqyptian peace treaty and a framework for 
further talks on middle east peace 
the 1988 conference of president carter israeli prime minister 
menachem begin and egyptian president anwar sadat was the longest 
international gettogether ever held there begin dubbed the place 
a concentration camp deluxe after his foreign minister moshe 
dayan went for a walk around the perimeter and reported back on 
the forbidding security fence that surrounds it 
president reagan did not entertain foreign visitors overnight at 
the catoctin hideaway but did have mrs thatcher to lunch there 
it was still true as eisenhower said in 1959 that for some 
reason an invitation to camp david had come to confer a special 
distinction upon a guest

the company that carved a niche for lowrollers 
in the nations highstakes gambling capital now presents the 
worlds largest hotel in the form of a castle 
the june 19 opening of the 290 million 4032room excalibur 
hotel will mark a milestone for circus circus enterprises inc 
the company which started with a struggling strip hotelcasino 
16 years ago and now values itself at 16 billion has become the 
envy of the gaming industry with a strategy focusing on family 
entertainment 
the giant castle at the south end of the glitzy las vegas strip 
is the brainchild of gaming executive william bennett who amassed 
a personal fortune of 500 million catering to middle americas 
gambling tastes 
the excalibur is anchored by four 28story towers and covers 
more than 70 acres it will replace two other las vegas properties 
that have held the title of the worlds largest hotel 
the las vegas hilton held the record with 3174 rooms according 
to the guinness book of world records that figure was eclipsed in 
recent weeks when the flamingo hilton opened a new wing giving 
that strip resort 3530 rooms and brief claim to the title the 
new mirage hotel here just missed the mark with 3054 rooms 
bennett and a former partner william pennington bought the 
circus circus hotelcasino in 1974 after the late billionaire 
howard hughes kept raising the ante on their first choice the 
landmark hotel today the landmark is struggling while circus 
circus has become an industry giant 
at the time i thought the landmark was the best of the two 
properties bennett said in a rare interview recently i think 
i was wrong i lucked out 
the 65yearold bennett owns 182 percent of the public company 
which had revenues of 522 million last year 
when the excalibur opens parent circus circus will have a total 
of 11320 rooms in nevada including two hotels in las vegas one 
in reno and two in laughlin by comparison atlantic citys 12 
major hotels total 8100 rooms 
the excalibur will give las vegas 75000 hotel rooms 
the new room count will give las vegas almost twice that of 
manhattans 47000 rooms with circus circusowned properties 
offering 11 percent of the total room base in las vegas said 
excalibur general manager bill paulos 
even bennetts vivid imagination couldnt have dreamed up the 
scenario that evolved from his purchase of circus circus he was 
forced because of the nature of his original property to target 
families rather than highstakes gamblers 
when bennett bought the circus circus hotelcasino it was a 
gaming mishmash catering to highrollers as well as families with 
kids 
it was awful bennett recalled they had childrens things 
mixed in with the gaming they had bumper cars where we now have 
the keno lounge 
midway games included one in which players tossed balls at a 
target trying to knock a scantily clad woman out of bed 
bennett and pennington wanted the landmark but the eccentric 
hughes who owned several las vegas hotels at the time raised the 
price from 15 million to 16 million then jumped it to 20 
million 
bennett and pennington passed 
after settling for circus circus they built a separate midway 
section for kids away from the gaming and provided free circus acts 
the success of circus circus has nudged las vegas toward other 
familyoriented features transforming the gaming capital into what 
local promoters like to call a total resort destination 
the excalibur will not be as familyoriented but there will 
be plenty of things for everybody bennett said the rooms will 
be more expensive an average 45 per night compared to 33 at his 
other properties it will be a more ostentatious setting its a 
definite upgrade 
the excalibur casino will offer gamblers higher limits and may 
provide gaming credit something thats taboo at circus circus 
the castles 500000 square feet of entertainment space includes 
a renaissanceera village 12 food outlets and a casino the size of 
four football fields with 2630 slot machines shows will feature 
a medieval flair with live jousting diners in the great hall a 
900seat amphitheater for floor shows will feast without utensils 
other attractions include an arcade with archery and other 
themed game booths strolling minstrels and a sherwood 
forestinspired wedding chapel 
off the theme will be a pair of motionsimulator theaters 
recreating an olympic bobsled ride roller coaster runaway train 
and a frantic ride down an icy mountain road 
keeping the enterprise moving will require a staff of 4300 
the giant castle with its towering spires is in contrast to most 
of the glitzy showplaces along the strip 
ive had in my mind for six or seven years to build a 
castle bennett said i had decided our presence in las vegas 
was just not big enough i thought the only way to build a 
successful property was to build a big property 
bennett studied old renderings of castles then made several 
visits to castles in england and germany with staff members to soak 
in the architectural and environmental detail 
we came up with more than 20 ideas that wouldnt step on the 
toes of the disney people he said 
company officials hired trademark experts to ensure their ideas 
didnt clash with disney castles at theme parks in california and 
florida 
the excalibur was built mainly with cash the company had on 
hand it sits on 77 acres of a 117acre tract the company bought 
several years ago bennett says the company may end up building on 
the remaining 40 acres 
were already thinking about whats next he said

george bushs second gettogether with mikhail 
s gorbachev shapes up as a summit of lowered expectations 
there will be no treaty signed to limit longrange nuclear 
missiles no announcement of a dramatic increase in trade between 
the united states and the soviet union 
other differences also will be felt moscows resistance to 
german unity its pressure on rebellious lithuania to rejoin the 
soviet fold and the slow pace of talks to call home hundreds of 
thousands of troops and tanks from europe 
an agreement will be signed to destroy chemical weapons and a 
statement will be issued announcing limits on cruise missiles an 
important step toward a broader treaty cutting the deadliest 
weapons in the superpowers arsenals 
but much of the three days of talks will be given over to 
discussing issues on which the superpowers are at loggerheads 
weve got a lot of things to discuss that might not result in 
a signed agreement bush said last week adding theres 
enormous problems that just need to be talked about 
yet he told reporters i dont want to have two ships pass in 
the night the united states and the soviet union 
recognizing the two leaders fondness for springing surprises 
many experts believe that something unexpected will emerge from the 
summit but probably nothing earthshaking 
they are almost compelled to pull one or two rabbits out of 
the hat but theyre going to be fairly small rabbits predicted 
robert w tucker a soviet specialist at the johns hopkins school 
of advanced international studies 
the administration always low balls summits said robert 
hunter a soviet expert at the center for strategic and 
international studies its the nw hampshire primary syndrome 
possible steps toward progress include further compromises for a 
pact covering longrange nuclear missiles where differences 
already have been narrowed significantly or pledges to revive 
slowly moving negotiations on a treaty to slash the superpowers 
european armies and stores of conventional arms 
tucker said the real importance of the summit is that it 
continues the string of superpower meetings 
its part of the long and complicated and arduous process of 
winding down the cold war and the differences that remain between 
us tucker said 
aside from striving for progress in arms talks bush will press 
gorbachev to allow a united germany to be a part of the usled 
nato alliance 
at stake said secretary of state james a baker iii is 
the reconciliation of a people and of a continent too long divided 
and the future of a legitimate and stable european order 
yet moscow has refused at least publicly to budge from its 
opposition to a united germany in nato fearing a shift in the 
balance of power in europe 
bush will press shevardnadze on the pace of negotiations in 
vienna aimed at reducing the us and soviet forces and 
conventional arms in europe 
as the president said thursday the talks havent gone as far 
or as fast as i would like to see maybe we can find some way 
at the summit to move cfe the talks forward 
the bush administration feels moscow has slowed the pace of the 
discussions on a conventional forces in europe treaty in part 
because it wants the large west german army scaled back 
on this issue there may be signs of movement 
last week soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
moscow advocates an acceleration in the vienna negotiations he 
rejected the notion that moscows concerns over the west german 
army have made his government hesitant to sign a cfe agreement 
moreover west german officials who met with shevardnadze say 
they think the us assessment of soviet concerns may be a 
misunderstanding 
lithuania also promises in bushs words to put some tension 
on the summit 
baker said recently that a good bit of the presidents time 
will be spent discussing the moves by baltic states to become 
independent of the soviet union and gorbachevs pressure to keep 
them in the fold 
gorbachev facing tests of his power at an important communist 
party congress in july likely will be unwilling to give up too 
much to bush experts say 
gorbachevs playing a very weak hand but hes playing it so 
well hes made himself look like an equal said hunter 
his objective is not to humiliate the president but to be seen 
as a member of the club its bushs interest to be as 
forthcoming with gorbachev as he can while gorbachev is doing what 
we want him to do hunter said they have a mutual interest in 
success at this summit 
gorbachev is interested in any help bush can offer for the 
battered soviet economy but that help at least for now wont 
include the trade concessions that once had been expected from the 
bush administration 
the united states will not grant the soviet union preferential 
mostfavorednation status because the soviet legislature has not 
passed legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration 
us law prohibits the president from granting such concessions 
to any nation determined to be denying its citizens the right to 
leave 
on the other hand bush recently loosened restrictions on sales 
to moscow of hightech products such as computers and precision 
milling equipment 
the two presidents also will discuss the unfulfilled efforts to 
sign a treaty limiting strategic arms 
while bush and gorbachev will declare their intention to reduce 
the numbers of their longrange nuclear bombers missiles and 
submarines by onethird the formal agreement they once had hoped 
to sign is not even close to being ready 
gorbachev arrives in washington wednesday evening as a leader 
enjoying widespread popularity on the international stage but 
strapped by immense problems at home 
his economy is wrecked his nation is torn by nationalist 
uprisings his farflung communist empire virtually is gone 
by contrast bush remains high in the public opinion polls and 
deals from a position of strength even though he is wrestling with 
difficult deficit problems 
yet bush does not want to undermine gorbachev or push him from 
power because he has been the champion of soviet reforms and 
allowed eastern europe to break free from moscow 
despite his problems gorbachev appears in control 
whether we like what he is doing whether we are unhappy with 
what he is doing the buck in the soviet government today stops 
with him said dimitri k simes a soviet expert at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace 
beginning thursday bush and gorbachev will hold two days of 
talks at the white house on saturday they will retreat to the 
privacy of camp david for a day of discussions on troublesome 
political issues 
it is at the presidential retreat bush said last week that he 
expects he and gorbachev can sit and talk about relations 
between the two superpowers 
the summit will end sunday morning when the two leaders hold a 
wrapup news conference in the chandeliered east room of the white 
house 
the planned showpiece of the summit will be the signing friday 
evening of the agreements to destroy chemical weapons and clamp 
longsought limits on air and sealaunched cruise missiles

while the cost of teenage mutant ninja turtle 
dolls from china probably wont be going up there may be an 
increase in the political price of president bushs policy toward 
beijing 
it could be avoided if there was a gesture from the chinese 
government to match the administrations move to maintain trade 
preferences but there is no sign of that 
democratic leaders and some republicans too are lining up for 
a congressional challenge to bushs decision to continue the 
favorable trade terms that have applied to china since 1980 it is 
one bush almost certainly can withstand just as he blocked by veto 
an earlier attempt to toughen sanctions against china for the 
repression of democracy demonstrators 
even so his critics have the politically salable side as the 
president said himself there is an impulse to lash out in 
outrage that we all feel 
this time the issue is the annual decision on extension of most 
favored nation trade terms toward china due on june 3 the first 
anniversary of the massacre of demonstrators in tienanmen square 
as bush said in announcing his decision on thursday most 
favored nation treatment is not a special favor or concession it 
is the treatment extended to almost every trading partner it means 
that no other nation will be extended better tariff and trade 
terms and the united states applies it to all but a handful of 
countries 
but it applies to communist nations only if the administration 
certifies that they permit their citizens to emigrate freely and 
that determination is subject to annual renewal the soviet union 
does not have most favored nation status because its emigration 
laws do not yet meet the requirement chinas do bush said 
but bush critics insist the status should be denied china to 
punish human rights abuses bush says that would hurt the wrong 
people and only make things worse isolating china and damaging 
the economy of hong kong 
congress could overrule his decision by adopting a disapproval 
resolution within 60 days but that would be subject to veto and 
it would take twothirds votes in each house to override bush 
us imports from china totaled about 12 billion last year 
with most of that trade moving through hong kong china buys about 
6 billion a year in us products 
chinese imports would be subject to sharply increased us 
tariffs without the most favored nation status the duty on toys 
for example would go from 12 percent to 70 percent 
thats where the ninja turtle dolls come in hong kong traders 
cite that big seller as an example saying that an end to the 
current trade status would boost the price from 5 to 9 apiece 
bush said some opponents of his earlier decision to impose only 
limited sanctions against china agree with him this time that the 
favorable trading status should be continued 
but some of those converts had said the renewal should be 
conditional and accompanied by a firm demand for human rights 
reform the administration said the law didnt provide any way to 
make the extension provisional 
bush said china had taken modest steps including the release of 
211 people arrested in the democracy demonstrations and the lifting 
of martial law in tibet 
while we welcome these and earlier steps they are lets face 
it far from adequate and i am not basing my decision on the steps 
that the chinese have taken so far bush said most important 
of all as we mark the anniversary of tienanmen we must realize 
that by maintaining our involvement with china we will continue to 
promote the reforms for which the victims of tienanmen gave their 
lives 
bush said the only message in his action is that isolation is 
bad economic involvement good 
his critics see another message 
the hope for freedom in china is as remote today as it was 10 
months ago said senate majority leader george j mitchell 
dmaine and what is worse the administration has signaled to 
the chinese leadership and the watching world that it views their 
actions with complacency 
mitchell said bushs policy has been secretive inconsistent 
and its outcome has been dismal failure 
administration policy over the year since the clampdown and 
killings in beijing has been one of limited sanctions that bush 
said remain basically unchanged but there has been a gradual 
easing of those strictures on trade and international loans 
shortly after bush announced the suspension of highlevel 
exchanges of top officials two of his senior aides went secretly 
to beijing they went back in early december while their july trip 
remained secret even from mitchell and the other congressional 
leaders they briefed on the second trip 
congress passed a bill to extend the visas of about 30000 
chinese students studying in the united states bush vetoed it 
saying he would do the same thing by executive order instead he 
did it with guidelines for immigration authorities putting it into 
an executive order this spring 
the difference is largely symbolic but symbols are part of the 
message 
we continue to have serious concerns about the human rights 
situation in china bush said wednesday in a report to 
congress which had asked for an account of the impact of us 
sanctions 
the report skirted the question saying the impact was difficult 
to measure precisely 
precisely or imprecisely nobody has come up with evidence of 
real results

its a cultural conflict rooted in the dreams of 
new americans hoping to scale the economic ladder and the 
frustrations of impoverished blacks unable to get even a toehold on 
its lowest rung 
tensions between blacks and the arab immigrants who have set up 
shop on some of chicagos meanest and poorest streets have festered 
for years 
the conflict is not unique to this city some blacks in the 
flatbush area of new york are boycotting two korean grocers because 
a black woman said she was beaten by a grocer but even by chicago 
standards the bitterness has reached a new low 
the tensions worsened this spring when a west side grocer placed 
a sign in his window this store is being remodeled no arabs 
will be involved 
the wards alderman a black was asked by the americanarab 
antidiscrimination committee to intervene but declined if that 
makes arabamericans angry alderman william henry said thats 
too bad 
henry later retreated quietly asking the white owner of buddy 
bears grocery to remove the sign even so 16 of the stores 
windows were smashed before the sign came down about three weeks 
after it appeared 
mayor richard daley declared the whole business a disgrace and 
ordered a city hall investigation and a group of blacks and 
arabamerican shopkeepers now meets regularly on the west side 
seeking ways to coexist peacefully 
but no one believes the problem is near a solution in the past 
12 months alone 
a black has sued an arabamerican grocer alleging he was 
beaten and his nose broken by workers at the west side store during 
an argument 
henry proposed a city ordinance that would have required all 
grocery store owners to speak english saying he was tired of 
shopkeepers who can count money but cant say thank you in 
english the ordinance was later revamped minus the language 
requirement and is languishing in committee 
a group of black ministers on the south side has organized a 
buy black campaign we said dont get mad get smart learn 
to control your own economy said the rev hiram crawford 
arabamericans say they are doing a service for residents of 
impoverished often dangerous communities long abandoned by the 
supermarket chains 
arab grocers are in those black communities because all the 
big grocers have left said fadi zanayed head of the 
arabamerican antidiscrimination committee which estimates as 
many as 1000 small stores in the city are run by arabamericans 
the citys two largest food chains have 69 stores in 
predominantly white neighborhoods but just nine in the largest 
black areas according to a survey by the chicago reporter a 
monthly that focuses on racial issues 
residents complain the smaller shops charge higher prices for 
substandard sometimes spoiled food and sell it under security so 
tight it makes customers feel they are under siege 
they come in and board everything up like its a prison said 
crawford they make you stand in a small area these stores are 
degrading the community 
zanayed said higher prices are a function of the smaller 
quantities purchased at wholesale by the merchants and the high 
insurance premiums charged to stores in highcrime neighborhoods 
strict security is necessary arabamerican merchants say 
on saturday i catch three people stealing in my store said 
david farhan who runs a grocery and liquor store with his son 
billy 
the farhans bought american food amp liquors six months ago on a 
desolate strip of roosevelt road in the lawndale neighborhood the 
store sits among abandoned buildings storefront churches and empty 
lots littered with debris 
while the problems the farhans face are considerable they say 
they have no regrets 
we have good relations with the people billy farhan said 
were satisfied 
so is fred mohamed who beat a neighborhood boycott 18 months 
ago to make a success of his giant foods 
unlike the farhans store giant foods is in a stable black 
middleclass neighborhood but when mohamed took over a store that 
had been abandoned for months he met significant community 
resistance 
they didnt want us here we were arabs and they didnt 
want arabs in the neighborhood he said 
he eventually signed a covenant with the chathamavalon park 
community council agreeing to employ blacks and do his banking in 
the neighborhood and gradually he said things have improved 
everything they wanted we were going to do anyway he said 
i think im past the worst of it there are feelings that linger 
i was just upset that the whole thing started without them 
even knowing me he said that my last name was mohamed just 
seemed to ignite this animostity towards the store 
mohameds case may be an exception however 
the base issue is that as long as many of the stores in the 
ghetto are owned by outsiders youre going to have that 
tension frustration and anger said richard taub a university 
of chicago social science professor who has studied small business 
development 
frustration runs on both sides store owners find it difficult 
to make a living in a poor community and sometimes act overzealous 
and obnoxious on the other hand groups that have to deal with 
them feel angry that its outsiders that own the stores and they 
dont 
jesse miller a black democratic ward committeeman on the west 
side echoes a widespread contention of blacks that they are denied 
the financial resources provided by banks to other ethnic groups 
theres clear evidence that these institutions do not create 
the same support for black entrepreneurship that they have for the 
others he said but the arab store owners in chicago and the 
koreans in new york say they get very little if any help from 
banks 
the only people that i know that get loans are the people that 
have been in business already because the banks dont give you 
money unless they know theyll get their money back said nayel 
abdullah owner of aampb food market 
he said he bought the store with his savings from driving a cab 
for seven years and loans from relatives and friends he tried to 
get a bank loan seven or eight months ago but was turned down he 
said 
i think if you look closely youd discover korean and arab 
groups have access to credit through informal credit pools 
family people in their community said taub there just arent 
enough black businesses out there 
miller said that in his lawndale neighborhood where more than 
40 percent of the population is below the poverty line residents 
are working to set up informal credit networks to help black 
business people make a start 
i believe the community itself must seek out ways by which it 
can support entrepreneurship by local citizens he said 
in the chatham neighborhood ministers of at least five churches 
are encouraging their congregations to patronize black businesses 
exclusively 
weve made every ethnic group in our community wealthy said 
crawford minister of israel methodist community church were 
just waking up

farmers have added another problem to 
their list of worries where to find leaded gasoline for old but 
serviceable tractors 
we know that in a few years it will virtually disappear from 
the market said martha casey spokeswoman for the us 
environmental protection agency i dont know how that market is 
going to turn out for farmers 
major refineries and most service stations no longer sell 
gasoline containing lead which the epa has been trying to phase 
out for the past decade major refineries quit producing leaded 
fuel because of the epas tougher pollution controls and declining 
demand 
but leaded gasoline still is needed to run tractors grain 
trucks combines and other farm machinery bought in the 70s or 
before using unleaded gasoline can damage the engines an epa 
study found 
the majority of heavy farm work is done by dieselpowered large 
tractors and combines the situation remains serious however for 
small farms and bigger operations that use light tractors for some 
work said gary huddleston information director for the kentucky 
farm bureau association 
based on a 1985 questionnaire the federal farm bureau 
federation estimates there are an average of 10 engines per us 
farm that use leaded fuel said jim porterfield associate director 
of the federations environmental division 
nearly half of the farmers said they want to continue using 
those engines for another 10 or 15 years at least porterfield 
said 
it puts us in a difficult position it will impose some 
hardship said mike crouse who was told his supplier would no 
longer have leaded fuel for two tractors he uses to farm 166 acres 
near dixon ky 
making things more complicated the epa requires service 
stations that sell gasoline containing a phosphorousbased 
additive but no lead to label the fuel as leaded farmers may 
not realize they arent buying fuel with lead which is needed to 
lubricate and protect valve seats in older truck and tractor 
engines 
epa studies of additives marketed to make unleaded gasoline safe 
for older engines have been inconclusive 
crouse said he cannot afford to replace the valve seats on his 
tractors which would enable them to accept unleaded gasoline the 
work would cost several hundred dollars he said 
the situation varies from state to state 
indiana farmers should have less trouble than some finding 
leaded gasoline because the indiana farm bureau cooperative 
associations refinery will provide more of the fuel as supplies 
dwindle elsewhere said ronald stover vice president of the 
coops petroleum division 
our leaded gasoline sales continue to increase although the 
market is shrinking overall he said weve gained about 7 
percent per year in the farm market during the last couple of 
years when most of the majors dropped out 
but in some areas of kentucky there is no leaded fuel 
available huddleston said

the switch to unleaded gasoline may have 
saved large tracts of trees in northeastern forests 
scientists a decade ago feared that the buildup in soil of lead 
which is toxic would damage and possibly kill trees but 15 years 
after the clean air act forced automakers to market cars that burn 
unleaded gasoline scientists say lead concentrations in the forest 
floor already are falling 
its beautiful the curve showing the decline of lead said 
thomas g siccama a forest ecologist at the yale university school 
of forestry and environmental studies 
it has left the forest floor faster than the general community 
of ecologists thought siccama said 
in 1980 siccama and two other scientists william h smith of 
yale and donald l mader of the university of massachusetts 
documented that from 1962 to 1978 lead levels in surface soils in 
massachusetts had jumped from 682 milligrams per square meter to 
1160 milligrams 
siccama smith and others including andrew j friedland of 
dartmouth college and arthur h johnson of the university of 
pennsylvania began looking more closely at the surface soil of 
forests taking samples from pennsylvania through new hampshire 
over the past year they and other researchers have begun to 
review the extensive data collected 
at one test site the cathedral pines forest in cornwall julie 
tritschler a yale graduate student found lead has fallen since 
1980 from 1275 milligrams per square meter to 940 milligrams 
at hubbard brook in west thornton nh lead levels in 1975 
approached 1100 milligrams per square meter by 1988 they had 
fallen to under 800 milligrams siccama said 
what is happening siccama believes is that over time the lead 
is being diluted in the underlying soil 
michael j kellett northeast regional director for the 
wilderness society said the data was encouraging but he cautioned 
that it is important to learn where the lead is going because it 
might end up in underground water supplies 
siccama and others say the decline in lead levels in soil is 
almost certainly due to the mandated use of unleaded gasoline in 
new cars beginning in 1975 
that was the whole point of the law siccama said it is a 
oneonone connection we know it has gone down in the rain and 
weve followed it going down in the soil where we knew it was 
accumulating

the oak ridge national laboratory may 
hold the key for a voyage to the bottom of the sea 
marine scientist sylvia earle a veteran of 50 deepsea 
expeditions wants to make the trip no mere skindiving trek ms 
earles quest is a plunge into the deepest part of the ocean 
seven miles down 
her husband graham hawkes has designed a new type of 
submersible vessel that looks more like an x15 airplane than a 
submarine to take her there 
unlike the heavierthanwater vessels of the present hawkes 
design calls for a buoyant vehicle able to swoop into the deep and 
back 
to be able to fly under water is the vision ms earle said 
hawkes and ms earle with the help of volunteers at their san 
francisco company are building an early version of the design 
called deep flight they hope to launch it in august or september 
but even if the oneperson craft meets expectations the 
limitations of its composite hull which makes it buoyant will 
only allow it to scratch the depths about 4000 feet 
to go 35000 feet down will require new technologies in hull 
design 
where we come in is that we have the advanced materials 
technology that enables you to carry those very high compression 
ratios those crushing pressures at deep ocean said oak ridge 
engineer ray garvey 
weve demonstrated the ability to make a hull that is lighter 
than water for a fourmile depth said garvey the labs program 
manager for structural composites 
the lab has developed a fabrication process for a composite 
material of graphite fibers that is stronger than steel at a 
fraction of the weight 
the april issue of popular mechanics magazine reported the labs 
graphite composite hull was successfully tested in an unmanned navy 
probe 
garvey refused to connect the government labs research with the 
navy vessel but he said what we have demonstrated is the 
ability to get most of the way there to the oceans bottom and 
the track that leads from here to there 
garvey invited ms earle to oak ridge recently to address the 
labs staff on her longterm goal called the ocean everest 
project and to tour the facilities 
the visit was also intended to challenge the engineers and 
persuade department of energy management of the potential of the 
earlehawkes project garvey said 
ms earle told her audience there is a popular misconception 
about how much is known about life in the sea we are just 
beginning to explore this planet just beginning to know it from 
the inside out 
only once before have people reached the bottom of the sea that 
was in 1960 when swiss oceanographer jacques piccard and navy lt 
donald walsh rode in a steel ball called the trieste to the bottom 
of the marianas trench they stayed 20 minutes 
it was really quite an amazing feat ms earle said what 
is more amazing however is that here we are 30 years later and 
nobody has been back 
ms earle wants it to see it happen again and again 
the key to that is here at this institution she told the 
oak ridge researchers the materials do exist the technology 
exists the expertise exists what has to come together is the will 
to make it happen

is the bartrams ixia a wildflower that 
blooms for less than a day but once a year so rare that it should 
be listed as endangered or is it a common plant thats just hard 
to spot 
researchers have been trying to answer the questions since a 
controversial proposal last year to include it on the federal list 
of endangered species 
during a recent survey of land owned by georgia pacific corp in 
putnam county company forester phillip parker said he found 
thousands of tiny purple ixia plants on at least a dozen sites 
im not qualified to say whether the ixia is truly endangered 
but if you have this many in other parts of northeast florida 
well have a really large number of plants parker said 
his survey was part of a cooperative effort this spring between 
the forestry industry and the us fish and wildlife service to 
find out how rare the ixia is 
surveys previously have been hampered by the ixias fickle 
nature the plants seeds can lie dormant for years until some 
disturbance notably fire causes them to germinate 
the plant then looks like any other grass until it flowers and 
that occurs only in the morning in may or early june an ixia 
flower lasts only one day before it shrivels 
timber companies who worry that placing the ixia on the 
endangered list could change their tree farming practices and keep 
them from using herbicides say the plant is abundant on their 
private lands 
those lands they say were not surveyed by federal biologists 
who proposed the plant for the endangered list 
the timber industry has successfully forced a delay in the 
decision on the ixia listing until fall to allow the current survey

coyotes are moving south 
they are established in florida theres no doubt about 
that said jim brady biological administrator with the state 
game and fresh water fish commission in gainesville 
the night predators with the eerie howls are becoming frequent 
sights or sounds in northwestern florida and are moving south 
a 1983 survey the states first found coyotes in 18 of floridas 
67 counties the southernmost sighting was orlando a second survey 
completed late last year found coyotes in 48 counties 
in the future you can expect the numbers to continue to go 
up said john wooding wildlife biologist with the game and fresh 
water fish commission theyll also be more widespread 
state officials havent estimated the number of coyotes 
the coyotes once mostly limited to the western range moved 
across the country and into canada and mexico with the help of 
hunters and people who wanted them in their woods to kill rodents 
and other pests 
coyotes live in suburban los angeles 30 miles north of 
manhattan and as of last year only 50 miles northwest of miami 
some wildlife biologists are intrigued by the way coyotes are 
increasing in areas where population booms are pushing out other 
animals 
i kind of get a kick out of seeing them and hearing them 
said brady who conducted the states first study 
the red wolf died out in florida early this century 
weve been without a predator this size for 70 or 80 years 
wooding said to a lot of people a predator this size in the 
system is good it balances things out 
however the coyotes are not welcomed by many residents 
morgan richardson a state wildlife biologist based in panama 
city thinks people blame coyotes for attacks on animals that 
actually were carried out by dogs 
but farmers have complained that coyotes killed farm animals 
state agriculture commissioner doyle conner said hes been 
forced to fence in the lambs on his 1000acre jefferson county 
farm 
anything that goes slipping arund in the dark killing little 
lambs is a pretty lowlife critter conner said

chairman roger smith will bang the gavel for the 
last time at general motors corps annual meeting friday and 
perhaps fittingly the occasion wont be without controversy 
shareholders will decide whether smiths annual pension should 
double to about 11 million 
smith retires july 31 after heading the worlds largest 
industrial corporation for 9 years and watching over a big loss of 
market share 
the proposal comes as the company is resisting efforts by its 
union workers to win inflation protection for their pensions in 
this summers contract talks 
not surprisingly union officials are incensed by the plan but 
so too are some of the companys big shareholders 
as a result the issue of executive pensions could make this 
years gathering more exciting than typical annual meetings 
shareholder proposal no 4 calls for modifications in some 
retirement plans that would increase sharply benefits for gms 
3350 topranking executives 
basically it would change the base for figuring pension 
payments from salary alone to salary plus bonuses pension plans 
for ford and chrysler corp executives are based on salary without 
bonuses 
the program will cost gm about 42 million a year and that 
galls michigan state treasurer robert bowman 
he says the states pension fund will vote its 88 million gm 
shares just over 1 percent of the total outstanding against the 
proposal 
offhand i can think of three better uses product 
development plant modernization and the workers pension system 
is underfunded he said i think all three of those are better 
uses of the money 
the 20member gm board which includes six company executives 
proposed the adjustment it said the current plans retirement 
provisions compared with total compensation ranks in the lower 20 
percent of all pension programs 
dale hanson chief executive officer of the california public 
employees retirement system said his organization would vote its 
62 million shares in favor of the proposal but he questioned the 
timing 
gm and the united auto workers union begin talks on a new labor 
agreement a few weeks before smith retires 
union members vigorously opposed the pension proposal 
it was not only illtimed but showed exactly where the 
company is at in terms of greed and the way theyre running the 
business said sam isaac a member of the uaws gm national 
bargaining committee from local 651 in flint 
despite their differing view bowman and hanson praised gm for 
bringing the matter to shareholders the board could have changed 
the formula without seeking shareholder approval 
say what you will about it bowman said but you cant 
call them anything but candid and upfront about putting it up 
before the voters 
bowman said he expects the plan to pass 
during smiths tenure gms share of the us car market tumbled 
12 percentage points to 32 percent the company laid off tens of 
thousands of workers and shut down factories for three years 
beginning in 1986 it finished second to ford motor co as the 
mostprofitable us automaker 
also during smiths tenure gm embarked on an extensive 
plantmodernization program expanded ties with overseas automakers 
and slashed costs to stay competitive not only with ford but with a 
halfdozen japanese automakers 
eleven other proposals ranging from south africa relations to 
space weapons are on the agenda friday

the united auto workers union is taking 
a surprisingly moderate promanagement agenda into negotiations 
with the big three automakers this summer an analyst says 
negotiators for the union will sit down with executives of 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp during the 
first two weeks of july all of the big three contracts are up 
sept 14 the first time since 1979 that they have expired at the 
same time 
about 2000 uaw members meeting at the unions bargaining 
convention approved a 120page book of dozens or resolutions that 
will serve as a guide for bargaining committees 
i was struck by the degree of moderation and the degree of 
overlap with management auto analyst scott merlis of morgan 
stanley amp co said wednesday a day after the twoday meeting ended 
the convention was a quiet one and the one potentially divisive 
issue indexing pensions to the cost of living was dispatched 
relatively quickly by uaw president owen bieber 
in his opening speech bieber outlined five broad priorities for 
uaw bargainers job security wage improvements maintenance of 
healthcare benefits pension improvements and making management 
more accountable to workers 
i think management and labor are united in a more competitive 
industry merlis said its because of the pressure of the 
japanese transplants and the lack of trade protection from the 
government that the uaw is moderating their wage demands in favor 
of job security 
before the japanese manufacturing invasion of the united states 
started in 1982 with honda motor co ltds factory in marysville 
ohio the uaw pushed hard for wage and benefit improvements but 
when the big threes collective market share began to be eroded by 
japanese imports and later us built vehicles the companies began 
looking for ways to cut costs 
that meant plant closings and layoffs shifting the uaws 
priorities to holding the jobs they had membership in the nations 
largest industrial union has dropped to about 1 million from 15 
million in the late 1970s 
this years negotiations will key on job security 
it was one thing when the competition was over there 
analyst charles brady of oppenheimer amp co said but when the 
competition started living in the house next to them all of a 
sudden things struck a little closer to home 
current contracts with the uaw permit plant closings only when 
products made at the factory suffers a sales slump gm and chrysler 
have used that clause to justify closing eight assembly plants and 
forcing the layoffs of 17000 employees during the past three years 
the uaw challenged the closing of one of the plants gms fiero 
assembly plant in pontiac mich but lost in a decision by an 
arbitrator the union has finetuned the focus of its plantclosing 
arguments 
we must compel them to retain all current workers unless their 
ability to survive is severely at risk as a result of conditions 
beyond their control bieber said in a convention speech 
while job security will be the top job for uaw bargainers they 
are going to have to pay attention to the 446000 retirees carried 
on pension rolls most of the debate at the uaw convention centered 
on providing costofliving adjustments for retirees 
but although members are demanding inflation protection for 
pensions bieber knows as automakers have said that it is 
extremely expensive some estimates put the cost at more than 1 
billion a year for the big three 
if such a proposal were adopted some have contended other 
contractual benefits would be cut 
bieber told delegates he didnt want bargaining committees 
handcuffed by proposing a costofliving adjustment as the only 
inflation hedge for retirees he easily carried the day 
what struck me about the demands is that never before have we 
had so much potential for easy agreement when it comes to 
pension merlis said 
the leadership ultimately has to be responsive to the rank and 
file merlis said and with the lack of dissidents the odds of 
a meaningful strike becomes much less likely

north americanmade car and light truck sales in 
midmay lagged 177 percent behind last years slow pace and 
dealers said dwindling incentives were hurting showroom traffic 
an auto industry analyst said the slowdown was a sign of 
peoples worries about the countrys and their own economic 
security 
more than at any time since 1981 i think auto sales are 
directly influenced by what the consumer is feeling about the 
economy said ann knight of painewebber inc in new york 
the big three automakers said wednesday that car and light truck 
sales dropped 219 percent for the period compared with midmay 
1989 that was partly offset a 529percent gain in sales of 
transplant cars those built in north america by japanese makers 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
their average daily vehicle sales slowed to 28983 in the may 1120 
period from 37126 a day in midmay last year 
at the same time combined sales of the cars made domestically 
by honda nissan toyota mazda and subaru rose to a daily average 
of 3041 from 1989 a year earlier 
overall sales of north americanmade cars dropped 193 percent 
and trucks dropped 15 percent 
after production cuts earlier this year trimmed inventories to 
match slow demand manufacturers generally were offering lower 
rebates and on fewer models than in midmay 1989 
len gossman sales manager at blackwell ford in plymouth said 
sales dropped to a slow but steady pace after lateapril 
announcements that incentives were being reduced 
gossman said he hoped new rebates on some models including 
fords twodoor probe would lure people back to showrooms after 
memorial day our guys are waiting for them to come in 
bob morris sales manager at avis ford in southfield said brisk 
orders for new escort compact and explorer sport utility vehicles 
kept him out of the slump and probe sales were picking up its 
spring and thats a sports car 
for the year to date big three vehicle sales trailed last 
years by 76 percent car sales lagged 106 percent and truck 
sales were 28 percent behind 
gm said its midmay car sales were down 237 percent and truck 
sales dropped 167 percent a 214 percent combined decline for 
the year to date gm said car and truck sales were running 43 
percent behind last years 
ford said car sales slumped 299 percent and truck sales dropped 
12 percent for the period a 229 percent drop overall ford said 
car and truck sales for the year thus far were 9 percent behind 
last years 
chryslers car sales dropped 221 percent and truck sales slid 
21 percent for midmay a combined 216 percent decline while its 
yeartodate sales dropped 136 percent 
some transplant makers which continued to gear up domestic 
production showed sharp increases honda was up 224 percent for 
midmay and 162 percent for the year toyota stepped up sales of 
domestically made camrys and corollas 117 percent for the period 
and 1086 percent for the year

swedens ikea brought its lowpressure 
lowprice furniture retailing formula to the new york city area by 
opening its fifth and biggest us store 
analysts said the companys amiable atmosphere has proved 
successful for the worlds largest furniture retailer elsewhere 
the early signs on opening day which was preceded by a massive 
media blitz were positive in this town just west of new york city 
thousands of shoppers stormed the blueandyellow store the size 
of seven football fields ikeas largest outside europe cars 
nearly filled its 1800car parking lot by the 9 am opening and 
traffic was backed up for more than a mile on the new jersey 
turnpike 
ikea creates a festive shopping experience which is 
antithetical to most shopping forays said ivan s cutler retail 
editor of furnituretoday magazine 
ikeas customers wander through 100 furnished rooms to look at 
sample kitchens bedrooms or living rooms and then fill out an 
order form for the stock number of their favorite sofa chair or 
table there are no commissionseeking salespeople 
customers dont have to bare their design soul said cutler 
the elizabeth store features supervised playrooms for children 
as well as a restaurant and shop featuring swedish delicacies such 
as lingonberries herring and swedish meatballs 
ikea has more than 80 stores in 20 countries and the privately 
held concern posted 23 billion in 1989 sales with 85 percent 
from europe 
wednesdays opening was part of a worldwide expansion 
ikea president anders moberg said the company expects its 
greatest expansion in eastern europe with 15 to 20 stores in the 
next six years 
nevertheless the company plans to open two or three stores a 
year in the united states 
it intends to surround the new york market with a second store 
to open in hicksville on new yorks long island in spring 1991 a 
site in westchester county north of the city is being sought 
with the addition of a store in burbank calif in the fall 
ikea could double its 1989 us revenues of 130 million 15th 
among all furniture retailers in the united states moberg said 
that expansion could hurt existing retailers especially in the 
readytoassemble market he said 
we are competing for the same market so there will be some 
losers moberg said 
but neil stern a partner in mcmillandoolittle a chicagobased 
retail consulting company said ikea was more likely to draw 
customers from many different areas and not hurt any single 
competitor too severely 
ikea saturated northern new jersey and new york city with 
advertising including three weeks of television ads 300 
billboards 1250 bus and subway panels and 133 full pages of 
newspaper ads in new jersey alone 
not everyone was thrilled however 
one billboard message to new jersey turnpike drivers was on 
may 23 find a place to crash on the new jersey turnpike 
turnpike officials asked the company to take down some of the 
signs said gordon hector a spokesman for the highway

pinnacle west capital corps annual meeting took 
on some aspects of the wild west as shareholders roasted management 
for big losses the dropping of dividends and the rejection of a 
takeover offer 
during the rowdy session wednesday in which some shareholders 
called for top officials to resign new chairman and chief 
executive richard snell acknowledged the company problems but said 
he had laid a clear recovery path 
snell said the company nearly foundered last year because of its 
fouryear ownership of merabank a 6 billion thrift taken over by 
the government in january 
the poor performance of the threereactor palo verde nuclear 
generation station also hurt results at pinnacle wests main 
subsidiary arizona public service co he said 
i ask for your clear understanding that there is a new 
administration here one which is not beholden to the prior one and 
which will function somewhat differently and whose mistakes will be 
its own he said 
snell who took over feb 5 from longtime ceo keith turley 
stepped into a company that lost 5514 million last year and had 
to restructure 676 million in debt to borrow money to get rid of 
merabank 
many of the more than 1000 shareholders at the meeting ignored 
his plea to wait for his program of cost containment improved 
nuclear operations and debt reduction to take root 
holders who expected reliable dividends from a utilityholding 
company called for for the resignations of directors turley and 
carl eller because of the companys decision last october to omit 
quarterly dividends 
turley left the room without commenting after the meeting but 
eller told reporters he had no intention of resigning 
i have been on the board a long time and i have contributed 
as much as i can said eller his expansion of circle k corp 
drove the conveniencestore chain to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection on may 15 just eight days after eller resigned as 
circle ks chairman and chief executive 
at one point snell was booed for defending management 
youre a liar shouted one man in the audience and another 
yelled fire snell 
snell said complaints about the companys rejection tuesday of a 
fourth takeover offer from pacificorp reflected more on a 200000 
pacificorp advertising campaign than the offer itself pinnacle 
west said the 21ashare 182 billion offer from the portland 
orebased utility was inadequate 
during the meeting one speaker asked everyone who would like to 
sell their stock for 21 a share to stand about half stood 
pinnacle wests shares rose 12 cents wednesday to 16 
it may be three years before dividends are restored snell said 
however he said a stronger performance should strengthen the 
companys share price in the meantime 
shareholders also rejected a proposal to force board members to 
hold at least 2000 shares of pinnacle west stock 
jeanne rossi of boonville calif who offered the idea said it 
was a way to make the board more responsibe

cocacola co launched a defensive advertising 
blitz to rescue its 100 million promotion for cans that spout 
prizes instead of soda 
the softdrink maker ran fullpage ads around the nation 
containing a detailed list of dos and donts for customers in 
search of its magicans 
as part of a campaign announced in march random cans of 
cocacola classic are equipped with mechanisms to eject cash or 
prize certificates when the cans are opened the ads acknowledge 
that in a small number of instances the prize mechanism may 
jam 
also the mechanism in a very small number of magicans 
detaches from inside the can and your prize wont pop out 
the ads feature crosssection drawings of properly working 
and malfunctioning cans advising customers to take a good 
look 
magicans contain no soda instead the prizes are stashed in 
vials which are suspended in chlorinated water to give the cans 
the heft and gurgle of the real thing 
in addition to malfunctioning ejection systems some of the cans 
have leaked water 
randy donaldson a spokesman for cocacola said the company has 
received 22 complaints since the cans reached shelves and vending 
machines earlier this month he stressed that the water in the 
prize cans though it tastes bad is harmless 
the ads warn consumers against drinking the water and include a 
tollfree telephone number to report bad cans 
listen for something jiggling inside the can thats a 
detached mechanism a faulty magican the ads say 
coke planned to distribute a quartermillion of the prize cans 
through the summer prizes include cash up to 200 and 
certificates good for such things as tickets to theme parks and 
sporting events 
emanuel goldman who follows the beverage industry for 
painewebber inc in san francisco said cocacola is acting wisely 
in addressing the problem before the big softdrink selling season 
starts over the memorial day holiday weekend 
the key thing is to fix it early and everyone will forget it 
ever happened goldman said this is not the hubble telescope 
its not that difficult to fix 
donaldson said the mechanical problem has been corrected and 
prize cans shipped beginning this week should have no problems 
though the trouble was detected in a relatively small number of 
cans donaldson said were just being extraordinarily cautious 
we dont want any of our consumers to be disappointed he said he 
did not know how much the ads cost 
the quick damagecontrol initiative recalled the companys 
nowlegendary reversal when it retired and later then 
reintroduced the classic formula of its flagship drink cocacola 
despite the problems the campaign has been successful with 
about 60000 prize winners so far donaldson said 
our plans are to continue the promotion he said 
obviously well continue to monitor the situation

prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov told the soviet 
people today they must shift from central planning to a market 
economy and must brace for high unemployment and inflation during 
an expected twoyear recession 
our decision is made we have to move to the market ryzhkov 
said in a nationally televised address to parliament in which he 
catalogued the ills of the ailing socialist economy 
kremlin officials are proposing a radical fiveyear reform and 
they want the plan to be approved in the first national referendum 
in soviet history no date has been set for the referendum 
in a twohour address to the supreme soviet parliament ryzhkov 
did not use the word referendum he told reporters later that a 
national vote was possible but that lawmakers must pass a law on 
referendums first he urged lawmakers to approve the reforms 
without the peoples consent we cant take this step every 
citizen of the country must express his attitude toward the 
project ryzhkov said 
after ryzhkovs speech several dozen members of the opposition 
interregional group decided to seek a noconfidence vote 
the government is not proposing a market only a price hike 
said alexei levashov a lawmaker from leningrad 
galina starovoitova another deputy warned that people might 
take to the streets if bread prices triple on july 1 the first 
step of the proposed reform 
ryzhkov dismissed efforts to unseat him but acknowledged that 
people find it very difficult to accept the proposal that has 
been put forward 
the governments task is to explain to convince people this 
is the road we have to take he told reporters 
ryzhkov gave assurances that the government would compensate 
people especially lowincome families to help them survive price 
hikes for necessities but he said there would be no compensation 
for more costly luxuries such as jewelry liquor tobacco and 
meat and fish delicacies 
he also promised to provide for the tens of millions of people 
that his deputies say could be thrown out of work by reforms 
last fall ryzhkov blocked parliament from passing a plan for 
more rapid reform and survived a noconfidence vote demanded then 
by interregional lawmakers who wanted to move more quickly to a 
market economy 
ryzhkov told parliament today the transition should be made in 
three stages starting next jan 1 food prices will double on the 
average meat prices will increase by 23 times and fish prices by 
25 times he said 
the first stage also will require parliament the council of 
ministers that ryzhkov heads and president mikhail s gorbachev to 
establish a marketstyle economic and banking system he said 
gorbachev was present in parliament and the live tv broadcast 
showed him reading the text and nodding his head from time to time 
the second stage of the reform the prime minister said will 
involve price reform a new taxation system and bank interest rates 
far higher than the 2 percent now charged and paid by banks 
we need a really tough financing and credit policy that should 
become a tool for the government to regulate economic life and 
prevent inflation he said 
the second stage also calls for transferring 60 percent of state 
enterprise to jointstock ownership for eventual sale to private 
individuals and companies or to the workers he said 
the actual transfer of ownership and a sharp reduction of 
central control should occur in 199395 or what ryzhkov called the 
period of demonopolizing the economy 
the model ryzhkov outlined which had not been detailed in 
public sounded closer to a western system of economic regulation 
than to the traditional centrally planned soviet economy in which 
moscow set virtually all prices and wages and even tried to specify 
wholesale delivery quotas 
a popular victory for the governments reform plan would 
constitute a national consensus on the failure of the communist 
dream but defeat could bring down ryzhkovs communist government 
if the program is not approved it is my opinion the 
government should resign deputy prime minister yuri maslyukov 
told a news conference on wednesday 
no soviet government has ever been forced to resign because of a 
loss in a referendum or parliamentary vote 
even if ryzhkov and his government step down gorbachev legally 
could continue the fouryear presidential term to which he was 
elected by the congress of peoples deputies this year he is also 
the communist party general secretary traditionally the top 
kremlin job

the lure of a larger share of the vacation 
travel market has led the nations big airlines to break with 
tradition and discount some of their domestic ticket prices during 
the busy summer season 
the latest air fare war began this week after united airlines 
placed newspaper advertisements on monday containing coupons good 
for 35 off roundtrip tickets of 175 or more 
a day later trans world airlines cut some of its domestic 
roundtrip fares by up to 30 percent and american airlines delta 
air lines usair and continential airlines announced wednesday they 
also were lowering their ticket prices 
and today united which said it had offered the coupons only in 
response to promotions by some of its competitors said it was also 
matching the twa reductions 
industry analysts say that so far the fare cuts pose little 
danger to the companies earnings 
there are some diminishing returns as far as profitability 
but you dont give up market share to someone else said paul h 
nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
if the war escalates earnings could become a casualty he said 
raymond neidl an analyst with dillon read amp co inc said it 
was surprising that the airlines were offering discounts so early 
in the vacation season reductions are more likely to be announced 
in august or september however he said the fare cuts were a good 
public relations campaign for the carriers 
uniteds coupons are good for flights through dec 14 but 
excluding nov 1630 the offer requires a saturday night stay and 
tickets must be bought seven days in advance of departure and no 
later than aug 31 
united surpassed last year by american as the nations biggest 
carrier in terms of traffic was looking for a recouping of that 
market share during the busy summer season nisbet said 
twa responded to uniteds move by cutting its domestic 
roundtrip fares by as much as 30 percent for travel tuesday 
through thursday twa also is requiring a saturday night stay and a 
sevenday advance purchase and tickets must be purchased by june 
7 the discount is in effect for flights through dec 13 
under twas discounts the lowest coasttocoast fares fall to 
298 from 42850 
the restrictions the airlines have placed on their discounts 
in particular the saturday night stopover requirement place the 
lower fares out of the peak periods for business travel the 
carriers most lucrative market 
neidl said he liked the way the discounts were structured 
because theyre not giving away business seats and they may 
generate new business 
american airlines said wednesday it would match twas cuts and 
delta spokesman neil monroe said his carrier would match twas 
reductions in the vast majority of our markets 
continental spokesman ned walker said his carrier would match 
twas fares systemwide and also accept uniteds coupons 
united spokesman rob doughty said today his airline would match 
the twa discounts doughty said united had decided to place the ads 
only after other airlines had offered discounts through directmail 
promotions 
usair said it would honor the united coupons and selectively 
match the twa discounts usair spokesman david shipley said 
wednesday his companys fares already were lower in some markets 
and would not be discounted in those areas 
northwest airlines said it also would honor the united coupons 
and was studying twas discount program and would decide later 
whether to match it 
a spokesman eastern airlines said it was studying the fare 
changes but had not yet decided what action if any it would take 
nisbet the prudentialbache analyst said the airlines might 
lose some profits on some routes in particular the 
transcontinental flights popular for vacation travel however he 
said this will be made up we believe by the heavier 
profitability in the markets that are not predominantly tourist 
certainly if the discounts were to continue spreading and it 
were to be a general acrosstheboard discount there would be an 
impact on earnings he added

the president also said he was pleased with the results so far 
of budget negotiations with congress over steps to reduce the 
deficit as he has repeatedly bush said he would not talk about 
specifics of any plan and said he would make a public address on 
the size and scope of the deficit when we get a solution 
bush threw an unusual bouquet in the direction of rep richard 
gephardt the house democratic leader with whom he has tangled 
saying gephardt had done a good job so far in leading the budget 
negotiations 
bush said he had no new encouragement to offer on the continuing 
standoff in the soviet union between the kremlin leadership and the 
breakaway baltic republicans 
the president opened his news conference with a declaration that 
he was renewing chinas most favored nation trading status for 
another year despite certain opposition from members of congress 
still seething over the antidemocracy massacre in tiananmen square 
a year ago 
bush urged congress today to pass a good strong anticrime 
bill but without curbs on semiautomatic weapons that were 
narrowly approved in the senate on wednesday 
i sent a crime bill to the congress and i would like to see it 
enacted as a law enforcement bill bush said the president said 
today he supports limitations on the number rounds of ammunition 
that could be carried in semiautomatic weapon clips but restated 
his opposition to the ban on the manufacture and importation of 
nine classes of semiautomatics 
lets get a good strong anticrime bill and then we can have a 
debate about what they want to do on automatic weapons issues 
said bush a longtime member of the national rifle association 
the automatic weapon part does not have my support and i wish 
the congress would stop adding matters of this nature

the nations economy grew at a sluggish annual 
rate of 13 percent from january through march far slower than 
previously believed the government reported today 
the commerce department said that the increase in the broadest 
measure of economic health the gross national product was much 
weaker than an initial estimate it made one month ago at that 
time it put gnp growth at a faster 21 percent rate 
the weak growth was accompanied by a spurt in inflation as a 
price index tied to the gnp climbed at steep annual rate of 67 
percent the biggest inflationary surge in more than eight years 
the increase was revised from an initial estimate of 65 percent 
although surprised by the size of the downward gnp revision 
economists said they did not believe it indicated the country was 
in danger of toppling into a recession 
they noted that the weakness came from a big reduction in the 
estimate of how much business inventories grew during the first 
three months of the year 
slower inventory growth was viewed as a favorable sign for 
future growth because it means businesses will have less of a 
backlog of unsold goods to work down before they can start ordering 
again 
the first quarter was a time of major inventory correction and 
actually a healthy correction said allen sinai chief economist 
of the boston co it was setting the economy up for sustained 
growth provided that sales stay up 
the 13 percent first quarter gnp increase was only a slight 
improvement from a 11 percent gnp growth rate in the final three 
months of 1989 the growth rates in both quarters were the slowest 
since the summer of 1986 when the economy grew at a 08 percent 
annual rate 
the inflation rate was the highest since it raced ahead at an 
annual rate of 77 percent in the final quarter of 1981 the gnp 
price guage rose 45 percent for all of 1989 
many economists expect inflation to moderate as the year 
progresses they contend the firstquarter report was skewed by 
unusual winter weather that killed crops and drove up fuel prices 
indeed commerce said about onehalf of the stepup was due to 
food and energy prices large increases in january followed 
unusually cold weather in december 
the growth rate was lowered today because of new information on 
business inventories which were revised down 85 billion from the 
original report 
the weaker economic growth means reduced tax revenues and adds 
to the problems confronting administration and congressional budget 
negotiators talks resume today on developing a formula to cut the 
deficit to the 64 billion mandated by the grammrudman balanced 
budget law for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
nevertheless it was proof the current expansion which began at 
the end of the last recession in november 1982 continued 
although slowly a recession generally is defined as two straight 
declines in the gnp 
the various changes means the gnp after adjusting for 
inflation totaled 4188 trillion after the first three months of 
the year 
the revision in the gnp was more than accounted for by 
change in business inventories the department said 
it said exports were revised up 99 billion but this 
revision was largely offset in gnp by an upward revision of 90 
billion in imports 
in a companion report the department said aftertax profits of 
us corporations slowed to a 02 percent increase in the first 
quarter after rising 28 percent in the octoberdecember period of 
1989 
corporate profits had fallen during each of the first three 
quarters of last year including a 11 percent drop during the 
comparable months of january through march 
surveys show that most economists believe overall growth during 
1990 will total 20 percent down from the 30 percent level of 
activity in 1989 and the slowest since activity declined 25 
percent during the recession year of 1982 
but many of the nations top economic forecasters predict the 
economy will avoid a recession for another three years and are 
crediting federal reserve monetary policies for the extended growth 
sixtythree percent of the 68 professional forecasters 
responding to a survey by the national association of business 
economists said they foresee no recession during the next three 
years 
and 46 percent of those respondents said the primary reason for 
the economic expansion is effective monetary policy james f 
smith nabe president and professor of finance at the university of 
north carolina told a news conference earlier this week 
the central banks federal open market committee has tried for 
two years to stem inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit 
without slowing the economy so much that it skids into a recession

most sophisticated passenger aircraft its computeraided piloting 
requires a cockpit crew of only two

president bush juggling delicate 
international issues said today it is premature to grant the 
soviet union preferential trading status even as he renewed the 
same benefit for china 
the china decision is sure to cause an uproar on capitol hill 
among members of congress who believe it sends the wrong message to 
beijing just a year after its crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
bush disagreed but said the political climate in this country 
would make it extraordinarly difficult to grant the same 
mostfavorednation status to the soviet union many in congress 
feel a direct linkage between trade and the kremlins treatment 
of the breakaway republic of lithuania he said and i must say 
it concerns me 
bush also said there are enormous problems he and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev will be discussing at next weeks 
summit that are unlikely to yield immediate agreement such as 
final outlines for reunification of germany 
he defended the progress reached in moscow last week by 
secretary of state james a baker iii in talks with the soviets he 
said the two sides are very close to agreement on a treaty to 
outlaw chemical weapons and have made progress toward a treaty 
reducing nuclear weapons 
asked if he had a more restrained reaction to the outcome of the 
talks than bakers upbeat characterization bush said there is no 
light between us at all on the subject i am very satisfied 
with where we stand 
on domestic issues bush pledged that his administration would 
work with congress to protect depositors whose money is held in 
savings and loan institutions that go into default he said he did 
not have a precise estimate of the cost of the sampl bailout 
although administration officials estimate the government may have 
to borrow 130 billion or more 
the president also said he was pleased with the results so far 
of budget negotiations with congress over steps to reduce the 
deficit as he has repeatedly bush said he would not talk about 
specifics of any plan and said he would make a public address on 
the size and scope of the deficit when we get a solution 
bush threw an unusual bouquet in the direction of rep richard 
gephardt the house democratic leader with whom he has tangled he 
said gephardt had done a good job so far in leading the budget 
negotiations 
bush said he had no new encouragement to offer on the continuing 
standoff in the soviet union between the kremlin leadership and the 
breakaway baltic republics he said he hoped all parties would soon 
begin negotiations gorbachev has pressed economic sanctions 
against lithuania 
i sent a crime bill to the congress and i would like to see it 
enacted as a law enforcement bill bush said the president said 
he supports limitations on the number of rounds of ammunition that 
could be carried in semiautomatic weapon clips but restated his 
opposition to the ban on the manufacture and importation of nine 
classes of semiautomatics the senate narrowly approved the ban 
wednesday 
lets get a good strong anticrime bill and then we can have a 
debate about what they want to do on automatic weapons issues 
said bush a longtime member of the national rifle association 
the automatic weapon part does not have my support and i wish 
the congress would stop adding matters of this nature 
the president opened his news conference with a declaration that 
he was renewing chinas mostfavorednation trading status for 
another year despite opposition from members of congress still 
seething over the antidemocracy massacre in tiananmen square a 
year ago 
said house speaker thomas foley i think he faces some very 
severe problems here at the present time i would say there are 
not the votes to approve it congress would have to override a 
presidential veto to overturn bushs decision 
foley said his personal opinion was that there should have been 
conditions attached which would prod china toward reforms 
regarding his china decision bush said i concluded that it 
is in our best interests and in the interest of the chinese 
people bush said ending the system of preferential tariffs for 
china would drive up costs for american consumers 
at the same time bush said he would not grant similar status to 
the soviet union until it enacts liberalized emigration 
legislation such action had been expected on may 31 timed for 
gorbachevs summit visit to the united states but the vote 
apparently has been postponed 
the soviets have not passed the legislation bush said 
china does have the proper policy 
bush said he was pleased with the prospects for a chemical 
weapons treaty at the summit and said the two sides had done 
very well in the last several days in progress toward an 
agremeent to cut nuclear weapons 
at the same time he said there was much work still to do on a 
treaty to cut conventional troops weapons and tanks in europe he 
singled out the reunification of germany as a particularly thorny 
issue that he and his summit partner will discuss 
bush wants a unified germany as a full partner in the western 
nato alliance a step opposed by the soviet union 
as for trade bush said the political climate in this country 
would make it extraordinarly difficult to grant 
mostfavorednation status to the soviet union many in congress 
feel a direct linkage there with the lithuanian situation and i 
must say it concerns me 
but as he has several times bush said it was vitally important 
for him and gorbachev to meet i dont want to have two ships 
pass in the night the soviet union and the united states weve 
got a lot to talk about he said 
bush said he was especially pleased that he and gorbachev would 
have time to talk at camp david the presidential retreat that 
offers a less formal atmosphere than the white house 
gorbachev is due to arrive in the united states next wednesday 
night and is scheduled to see bush over the next four days he is 
also expected to visit minnesota and california before returning to 
the soviet union

president bush today renewed chinas 
mostfavorednation trade benefits for one year brushing aside 
critics who favored a hard line a year after the beijing 
governments crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
i did not want to hurt the chinese people bush said i 
concluded that it is in our best interests and the interest of the 
chinese people to continue chinas trade status not to do so would 
hurt the united states 
most favored nation status gives china the same benefits 
including lowestpossible tariffs that the united states extends 
to its major trading partners losing that status would subject 
some 12 billion in chinese products last years level of imports 
to sharply rising tariffs 
bush also noted that china buys about 6 billion a year in us 
products including aircraft wheat chemicals lumber and other 
products lose this market and we lose american jobs he told a 
white house news conference 
congress can block the administrations move only by enacting a 
resolution of disapproval which is subject to presidential 
veto it thus would take twothirds majorities in both chambers to 
override bushs decision 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said shortly after 
bushs announcement i think he faces some very severe problems 
here at the present time i would say there are not the votes 
to approve it 
foley said there should have been conditions attached to any 
extension to prod china toward reforms however an administration 
official said in advance of bushs remarks that the trade status 
either must be renewed each year or withdrawn that there is no way 
to make it provisional 
in an opening statement before taking questions from reporters 
at the white house bush stressed that his decision was not meant 
to condone the policies of the government of china in suppressing 
the prodemocracy movement there 
in answer to a question he said i dont think this is a 
reward to beijing 
bush said other sanctions against the chinese government would 
remain in place and called anew on beijing to improve its 
humanrights record 
he vehemently rejected assertions the move sent the wrong signal 
to leaders of the prodemocracy movement 
it says that economic contacts are the best way to keep the 
economic reforms going bush said it says that the more 
economic contacts we have with china the more they are going to see 
the fruits of freemarket economies it should send no other 
message than that isolation is bad and economic involvement is 
good 
withdrawing chinas mostfavorednation trade status probably 
would have sent tariffs soaring on chinamade goods including 
about 85 billion in mostly toys and textiles reexported to the 
united states by hong kong the hong kong government which lobbied 
hard against withdrawing the most favored nation benefits contends 
the move would send tariffs to as high as 70 percent 
bush made the announcement just hours before a senior state 
department official was to appear before congress to explain the 
decision and answer critics of the administrations china policy 
bush said several us allies and major trading partners had 
urged him to renew chinas trade benefits 
secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters wednesday 
that failure to renew the benefits could harm very significant 
and substantial us economic interests 
although the decision widely expected already has caused an 
uproar among critics of bushs china policy bush and baker both 
said that withdrawing the trade benefits would do more harm than 
good 
the real issue is who gets hurt or who gets hit if you decide 
that youre not going to extend it baker said 
he said the administration remains upset with the 
disappointing lack of progress by chinese leaders on the human 
rights front since the bloody crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in tiananmen square on june 4 1989 
you should consider the effect of this upon the reformers in 
the chinese government people that want to take china toward more 
openness and toward more democratization baker said 
you ought to consider i would think the effect on some very 
significant and substantial economic interests that the united 
states has including the effect on er said 
asked by reporters what evidence of improved conditions the 
administration could hong kong bakpoint to in the year since the tiananmen 
square killings baker said the release recently of 211 
detainees the lifting of martial law in tibet a general 
indication of willingness to take steps such as that 
but he added you ought not to draw that type of linkage i 
think the real issue is what are the consequences of 
terminating it

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting prospects for further planting delays in the midwest and 
more large grain sales to china 
corn and soybean futures were up strongly following forecasts 
for rain this weekend and next week in the corn belt where soggy 
field conditions have frustrated farmers attempts to finish their 
spring corn sowing 
the weather outlook was seen as more supportive for the corn 
market than for soybeans since farmers can still switch to 
soybeans if they are unable to get corn planted in time to avoid 
yield losses 
i would say that if they dont get done planting corn by the 
end of next week you will see some acres shifted to soybeans 
said william biedermann director of research with the commodities 
brokerage allendale inc 
wheat futures rose only slightly on this mornings news that the 
bush administration has decided to extend for one year chinas 
status as a most favored trading partner 
the designation means china is likely to remain a major foreign 
buyer of us grain 
in early trading wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in july at 334 a bushel 
corn was 3 cents to 4 cents higher with july at 280 a bushel 
oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with july at 153 a bushel 
soybeans were 6 cents to 7 cents higher with july at 616 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange following steep losses in wednesdays 
session 
live cattle futures were 15 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
june at 7377 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent lower to

health secretary louis sullivan urged the 
states today to ban cigarette vending machines license tobacco 
retailers and take other steps to stop young people from buying 
tobacco 
in testimony submitted to the senate finance committee sullivan 
said strengthening enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of 
cigarettes to children is the single most important reform 
states could make to keep teenagers from taking up the habit 
sullivan proposed model legislation that he urged the states to 
enact including a ban on vending machines that dispense cigarettes 
you cant buy beer from a vending machine why should you be 
able to purchase cigarettes there sullivan asked 
the package also includes a provision that would create a 
licensing system for tobacco retailers similar to the system used 
to control the sale of alcoholic beverages 
another provision would institute penalties including fines and 
license suspensions for retailers who sell cigarettes to minors 
the model law attempts to create workable procedures which 
will provide retail outlets the incentives and tools to refuse to 
sell tobacco to minors as already required by law in 44 states 
and the district of columbia he said 
sullivan said adult smokers would not be affected by the 
proposed law 
a spokesman for the tobacco institute walker merryman said 
sullivans proposal was an easy shot at the people who own and 
operate vending machines but would not be effective at keeping 
tobacco away from children 
i dont think that this is going to do anything to affect the 
number of young people who buy cigarettes merryman said we 
know from a variety of surveys that a very small percentage of 
minors who buy cigarettes buy them from vending machines 
ahron leichtman president of citizens against tobacco smoke 
praised sullivans ideas which he said could become the 
centerpiece of americas war against drugs the momentum is 
building for an allout battle against tobacco 
after his testimony sullivan was asked by reporters why he was 
proposing a statebystate solution rather than a uniform federal 
law he said that by encouraging the states to enforce their 
lawswe would use the system thats already in place 
he said the states could phase in such a ban on vending machines 
by first restricting their locations to places such as nightclubs 
and bars where children are not permitted 
problems dont always have to be solved with a broad swath 
from the federal government he said 
sullivan also said that he supported the intent of antismoking 
legislation that was passed by a senate committee last week but he 
said the administration does not support the legislation because it 
would create another federal bureaucracy 
finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said he was interested 
in sullivans approach and said the proposed model state 
legislation is a good step forward 
antismoking legislation approved last week by the senate labor 
and human resources committee would spend 110 million on a program 
to encourage states to enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes 
to minors including restrictions on vending machines 
the bush administration in february said many provisions of the 
legislation were unnecessary 
an article in this weeks issue of the journal of the american 
medical association said 3 million americans under age 18 consume 
947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of snuff 
and chewing tobacco annually 
nearly 19 percent of high school seniors smoke daily 11 
percent of them more than a half pack per day according to an 
annual survey of high school seniors by the national institute on 
drug abuses annual survey of high school seniors 
sullivan has said that 80 percent to 90 percent of adults who 
smoke started before they were 18 years old 
about 16 percent of illegal cigarette sales to minors come from 
vending machines according to a report by the inspector general of 
the department of health and human services requested by sullivan 
the younger the children are the more likely they are to 
purchase from a machine said the report released today 
enforcement experts agree that effective youth access 
legislation should deal with vending machines the report said 
the report said half the states have no policy on access to 
cigarette vending machines by minors and a third require a warning 
sign be posted on the machine saying sales to minors are prohibited 
a few states limit placement of vending machines to places that 
do not allow children and utah had limited success in an 
experiment using locking devices that required an employee to 
activate the machine the report said 
sixteen communities in minnesota have banned cigarette vending 
machines entirely and these bans have generally been well 
received and are expected to lead to stricter enforcement of 
overthecounter sales 
sullivan has made antismoking issues one of his top priorities 
at the department of health and human services 
in january he took on rj reynolds tobacco co for planning to 
test market a cigarette aimed primarily at blacks saying the 
company was promoting a culture of cancer the next day 
reynolds canceled its plans 
then he called on professional athletes to turn away the blood 
money from cigarette companies that sponsor sporting events 
more recently lawmakers were wondering whether sullivan had 
changed his views on smoking when his assistant secretary for 
health james mason canceled his appearance at a congressional 
hearing on cigarette exports 
but sullivan said that was a trade issue and best addressed by 
trade officials he said one of his top priorities remains to 
eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as 
intended causes death 
cigarettes health officials say cause about 390000 premature 
deaths annually from lung cancer heart disease and other 
cardiovascular disorders

eastern airlines said the carrier was doing well in its efforts to 
recover from bankruptcy and officials were not actively trying to 
sell the firm 
martin shugrue gave eastern airlines creditors a status report 
wednesday in their first meeting since he was appointed to run the 
airline 
we had a very candid constructive open dialogue with the 
creditors shugrue said i was very encouraged by their 
attitude 
there have been recent reports that northwest airlines and 
perhaps pan american world airways were interested in acquiring or 
combining with eastern 
weve had as ive said before expressions of interest from a 
number of people and well examine every expression of interest 
but to comment any further is just premature shugrue said 
were not out peddling the business or shopping the company 
were devoting our energies to restoring viability to eastern and 
were off to a darn fine start he said 
easterns cutrate ynot fare promotion offering moneyback 
satisfaction guarantees and firstclass seats for belowindustry

we have seen doubledigit increases in our advance bookings 
for summer travel northsouth travel families coming to florida 
flying eastern airlines and were very heartened by our initial 
look at the marketplace he said 
shugrue who would not give details of the meeting with 
creditors at a hotel in this miami suburb was appointed april 18 
by a federal bankruptcy judge after creditors became increasingly 
upset by setbacks in the rebuilding plan of the texas air corp 
management led by chairman frank lorenzo 
eastern has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since 
march 9 1989 
shugrue said negotiations were ongoing with the pilots and 
machinists unions the pilots are negotiating recalls of union 
pilots who ended their sympathy strike last november while the 
machinists union has been on strike since march 4 1989 
several picketers from the machinists union were outside the 
hotel before the meeting union spokesman steve alvarez said the 
demonstration was a friendly one meant to inform the creditors of 
the unions eagerness to work to help eastern recover

president bush said today the worsening 
savings and loan crisis causes me great concern and the first 
priority of government policymakers is to protect the depositors 
we dont know the impact on the taxpayer yet bush told a 
news conference in the white house briefing room a day after 
administration officials released a new assessment of the problem 
bush said administration officials dont know a specific 
figure for the ultimate cost of the bailout but that treasury 
secretary nicholas brady had testified on some broad paramaters 
that are on the record 
brady told congress the administration now estimates the 
government will have to borrow between 90 billion and 130 billion 
to clean up the mess tne new assessment came after the 
administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk of the 
problem could be resolved with the 50 billion in borrowing 
authority included in the sampl bailout bill 
what we are going to do about it is have negotiations with the 
congress and out of this i am sure that we will have an answer that 
congress agrees with the president said referring to the budget 
negotiations now underway 
we cant brush this problem under the rug it has been 
building for 20 years and it is something that causes me great 
concern bush said 
we do know that we are going to protect the depositors and 
that is what this is all about bush said it isnt protecting 
any savings and loan people it is protecting the depositors 
the administration won praise on capitol hill wednesday for 
finally issuing a realistic assessment of how much it will cost to 
clean up the savings and loan industry already the largest 
government bailout in history 
but some democratic critics questioned why it took so long to 
come up with an accurate figure they wonder why the government 
isnt doing more to prosecute the highflyers who created the mess 
in the first place 
the administration also left unanswered how to pay for the 
higher bailout cost leaving that for the current round of budget 
negotiations congressional and administration budgetwriters are 
looking for ways to reduce next years federal deficit to the 64 
billion required by the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
the exploding costs of the sampl bailout were one of the principal 
reasons the administration was forced to call for the budget 
negotiations in the first place 
the revised estimate marked the first time the administration 
acknowledged that the 50 billion in borrowing authority included 
in last years massive sampl bailout bill would not be enough 
private analysts who follow the sampl industry generally agreed 
with the new figure although it omits interest costs from the 
equation when borrowing costs are added the ultimate price of the 
bailout over 40 years is likely to top 300 billion 
the administration is to be commended for producing much more 
realistic and candid numbers than they did 15 months ago said 
bert ely an alexandria va savings and loan analyst 
brady blamed 90 percent of the higher cost on a depressed real 
estate market where sampls have most of their loans 
we are dealing with a moving target made greatly more 
expensive by a weakening real estate market and constantly changing 
economic conditions brady said 
however robert litan of the brookings institution discounted 
bradys explanation contending the fact is they made a mistake 
they lowballed it 
some democratic critics contended the new estimate showed that 
the administration was not moving quickly enough to close sick sampls 
rep charles schumer dny said that without prompt action 
the crisis will ge worse 
but rep jim leach riowa called the new estimate an 
enormous step toward a reflection of greater reality for the 
first time we have a government statistic that i believe has 
certain credibility to it 
rep byron dorgan dnd faulted the administration for not 
doing enough to prosecute sampl operators who squandered depositors 
funds through fraudulent loan practices 
why ask the taxpayer to ante up more money when we see no 
action to put the people who stole us blind in jail he asked 
in an effort to respond to criticism that criminal prosecutions 
have lagged timothy ryan the new head of the office of thrift 
supervision told reporters wednesday that financial regulators 
were working to get the worst criminal cases forwarded to 
prosecutors sending 20 cases to the justice department in recent 
weeks with an additional 100 cases being prepared

the stock market showed a small loss today as 
traders studied the latest data on economic growth 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 332 to 285294 
by noontime on wall street 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 618 up 695 down and 
551 unchanged 
as the business day began the commerce department reported that 
the gross national product grew at a 13 percent annual rate after 
adjustment for inflation in the first quarter of the year 
the reduction in the figure from a previous estimate of 21 
percent was larger than most analysts had been estimating 
but the significance of the numbers was clouded by word that the 
difference stemmed to a great extent from a downward revision of 
business inventories rather than final sales 
a shrinkage in inventories can be interpreted not as a clear 
sign of economic weakness but rather as a possible portent of an 
approaching pickup in production demand 
interest rates were unchanged to narrowly lower in the credit

television junkies get ready to graze 
despite failed effortmore are expected to be purchased this year at 
an 
average cost of 2500 per dish said chuck hewitt head of the 
satellite broadcasting and communications association 
it may appear at first glance that cable tv system operators 
with hundreds of millions of dollars invested in groundbased 
delivery systems and more than 52 million customers would be 
archenemies of satellite tv 
but the nations leading cable operators are at the forefront of 
two plans announced in february for satellite delivery systems 
nine cable operators including the two largest 
telecommunications inc of denver and time warner incs american 
television and communications corp of stamford conn are part of 
kprime partners which plans a 10channel service 
kprime intends to beam signals from seven bigcity tv stations 
such as wgn of chicago and ktla of los angeles along with three 
payperview channels to receiving dishes the size of a garbage can 
lid its satellite is in orbit 
the service which will be tested in 40 markets in october and 
launched nationally in january will cost 2025 a month after a 
50100 installation fee said group chairman john j sie 
he said he would like to get a couple million subscribers to 
what is being billed as an extension of existing cable service and 
the group plans to step up to a higherpowered satellite and more 
channels in a few years if the service succeeds the initial cost 
of the kprime venture is 100 million 
the second major satellite tv project is a 1 billion venture 
called sky cable that has the backing of rupert murdochs news 
corp ltd general electric cos national broadcasting co the 
cable operator cablevision systems corp and general motors corps 
hughes communications inc 
it plans to use three highpower satellites that will be 
launched in late 1993 and early 1994 and employ technology still 
under development which will enable it to beam up to 108 channels 
to 12inchby18inch receiver panels that can be mounted in a 
windowsill 
the receivers will cost about 300 the monthly service fee has 
not yet been established the service is expected to start in 1994 
the sky cable partners hope to carry many networks now offered 
on cable including those they own such as bravo consumer news and 
business channel and american movie classics as well as 
payperview services and specialized channels that appeal to 
narrow audiences like chess players 
but launching such services is complex charles dolan of 
cablevision said he hoped the sky cable partners would sign a 
definitive agreement by late april that milepost has passed with 
no new target date in sight although those involved say there are 
no serious disagreements 
the financial risks also are obvious news corp has lost more 
than 400 million to date in launching satellite tv service in 
britain 
both kprime and sky cable should appeal to the estimated 16 
million us households located in areas so remote that cable tv 
systems may never try to reach them by ground connections 
but what about the city dweller who decides to sign up for sky 
cable directly bypassing his regular cable company 
cablevisions dolan says thats unlikely viewers want to watch 
local stations and cable systems will still be the best way to get 
them he said local advertisers also will still need local cable 
outlets 
dolan wants cable system operators to serve as intermediaries to 
customers for sky cable handling service calls billing and 
signups for a fee 
he argues that sky cable and local cable systems can complement 
each other enabling local systems to add channel capacity for 
customers without incurring the heavy costs of rebuilding ground 
connections he said subscribers wont care who is providing which 
stations 
cable analyst michael kupinski of the investment firm ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis said satellite tv services wont 
seriously threaten local cable operators for years inertia is in 
local cables favor he said 
everette dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies at columbia university said satellite tv 
absolutely threatens local cable systems and said that may 
explain why big cable operators are moving quickly into this 
emerging side of the business 
cable was always seen as a transitional technology he said 
this is risky and dangerous in the short run but there really is 
no choice they have to become players 
several major cable network operators declined to comment on dbs 
ventures they acknowledge privately that while they would like to 
get wider distribution so they can attract more advertisers they 
dont want to alienate cable system operators cable brought us 
to the dance one said 
many cable system operators own stakes in cable networks and 
some bristle at sky cables plans to sign up existing cable 
networks 
but critics say cable operators who own cable networks have too 
much power already and feel viewers would be better served by 
independent satellite tv operators 
dan garner president of advanced communications corp in little 
rock ark is one of the wouldbe independent satellite tv 
operators 
he is trying to arrange 700 million in financiang for 
satellites for a 54channel service that he said would carry a mix 
of basic educational and premium networks radio stations 
payperview channels and electronic publishing services 
we are the competition the independent dbs operator 
garner said our prices will be less and our service will be 
better and you will be able to get us on the phone

the house agriculture committee tried today to 
set commodity target prices and loan rates in the 1990 farm bill so 
farmers would have adequate support without excessive government 
spending during the next five years 
a proposal from rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the 
wheat soybeans and feed grains subcommittee and rep ron marlenee 
rmont would freeze target prices on wheat at 4 until 1995 
it would set loan rates at 85 percent of the average market 
price from the previous five years that would be an increase over 
current law 
the target price is the amount the government sets as the ideal 
price for a commodity the loan rate is the amount the government 
gives the farmers before planting to assure they can afford to put 
crops in the ground 
the government ends up paying the farmer the difference if the 
target price is higher than the market price if the market price 
falls below the loan rate the farmer turns over his crops to the 
government and doesnt have to repay the loan 
the committee had hoped to finish its work on the farm bill by 
the end of the day but was moving slowly because of protracted 
debate 
by noon the section on wheat was not finished and six other 
sections remained feed grains oilseeds sugar conservation 
research and miscellaneous 
on wednesday the committee worked into the night to complete 
the bills sections on wool honey dairy and general commodity 
provisions 
the senate agriculture committee meanwhile called off further 
action on its version of the farm bill until it devises a 
commodities price support system acceptable to both republicans and 
democrats on the committee 
the task was assigned to committee chairman patrick leahy 
dvt and sens bob kerrey dvt david pryor dark richard 
lugar rind bob dole rkan and thad cochran rmiss who are 
not expected to have a proposal until next month 
though budget uncertainties election year concerns and 
international trade talks on agriculture are pressuring the 
lawmakers both the senate and the house committees are determined 
to push onward with the bill that will set farm policy for the next 
five years even though those factors could lead to changes later 
among the key changes sought by farmers in the 1990 legislation 
is more flexibility to rotate crops both for environmental and 
market reasons of particular concern is the way the current 
program has rewarded wheat and feed grain production at the expense 
of soybeans and other oilseeds while the world demand for oilseeds 
has increased 
the proposal adopted wednesday by the house committee would 
allow farmers to switch 25 percent of the acreage now protected by 
subsidies to some other crop without losing the potential to put it 
back into a subsidized commodity later 
lawmakers reasoned that this could help boost soybean production 
without adding to government costs 
the committee also voted to limit government subsidies for wool 
producers so each farmer receives no more than 250000 a year 
that cap was the only significant change made in wool and mohair 
policy for the 1990 farm bill it puts sheep farmers under the same 
limitations as other commodity producers 
the other provisions in the wool and mohair section are 
basically the same as those established by the 1985 legislation 
the senate made no changes in the current program 
the purpose of the wool and mohair program is to encourage 
production by providing incentive payments 
during the last decade however the amount the government 
guarantees wool producers has averaged almost twice the market 
price resulting in record government payments 
wool and mohair payments totaled about 93 million last year 
down from the record 152 million in 1987 
the house also approved a honey program that maintains 
government support at current levels 
the government helps honey producers maintain a stable income by 
offering loans at a certain price per pound if the market price is 
lower than the loan rate the farmer turns his honey over to the 
government as full payment for the loan 
the cost to the government has been between 42 million and 100 
million a year since 1985 
the committee completed work on the dairy section of the bill by 
voting for a study of state milk pricing programs that could lead 
to changes in the way milk processors are subsidized 
the provision was a compromise that allows california to 
continue to enjoy a special federal allowance that helps 
manufacturers of cheese nonfat dry milk and other milk products 
in that state 
the day before the committee did its major work on the dairy 
program by deciding that farmers should receive no less than 1010 
per hundred pounds of milk 
under current law dairy support prices have no minimum and 
could drop as low as about 860 per hundred pounds

retirement plans sharply increasing benefits for the companys 
topranking 3350 executives 
it basically would change the base for figuring pension payments 
from salary alone to salary plus bonuses smith was paid 25 
million in 1989 more than half in stock options 
pension plans for ford and chrysler corp executives are based 
on salary without bonuses 
the program will cost gm about 42 million a year that galls 
michigan state treasurer robert bowman who says the states 
pension fund will vote its 88 million gm shares just over 1 
percent of the shares outstanding against the proposal 
offhand i can think of three better uses product 
development plant modernization and the workers pension system is 
underfunded he said i think all three of those are better 
uses of the money 
the 20member gm board which includes six company executives 
proposed the pension hikes it said the current plans retirement 
provisions compared with total compensation ranks in the lower 20 
percent of all pension programs 
dale hanson chief executive officer of the california public 
employees retirement system said his organization would vote its 
62 million shares in favor of the proposal but he questions the 
timing 
gm and the united auto workers union begin talks on a new labor 
agreement a few weeks before smith retires 
it the pension proposal was not only illtimed but showed 
exactly where the company is at in terms of greed and the way 
theyre running the business said sam isaac a member of the 
uaws gm national bargaining committee from local 651 in flint 
bowman and hanson despite their differing views praised gm for 
bringing the matter to shareholders the board could have changed 
the formula without seeking shareholder approval 
say what you will about it but you cant call them anything 
but candid and upfront about putting it up before the voters 
bowman said 
bowman said he expects the plan to pass 
activist shareholder evelyn y davis said thursday she will make 
her annual appearance at the meeting she promised to wear a short 
dress symbolizing that gm shareholders are getting the short 
end on the pension issue 
eleven other proposals ranging from south africa relations to 
space weapons are on the agenda friday

a japan airlines order for 20 boeing 747400 
airplanes is one of the top boeing orders of all time and makes jal 
the largest customer for the jumbo jet boeing officials said 
thursday 
the order worth 31 billion brings to 40 the number of firm 
orders placed by jal for the 747400s jal also has options for 34 
more of the aircraft 
if all options are exercised the order would be worth more than 
7 billion said tom cole spokesman for boeing commercial airplane 
group 
the jet which can seat 600 people has a range to 8400 miles 
and a computeraided cockpit that requires a crew of only two the 
jal planes will be configured to carry 375 to 404 passengers in 
three classes and will be outfitted with general electric cf680c2 
engines 
following jal in firm orders for the 747400s are singapore 
airlines with 29 and all nippon airways co of japan with 26 cole 
said 
we call the pacific a 747 ocean he said we do expect 
the airplane to sell well it really has no competition 
the order brings to 1002 the total number of orders for the 747 
series jets making it the fourth civil airplane type in history to 
surpass the 1000mark in sales boeing said the other models are 
boeings 727 and 737 series and the mcdonnell douglas md80 series 
in dollar terms the deal puts jal in a fourway tie for fourth 
place among all boeing orders with all nippon airways united 
airlines and delta airlines 
the largest boeing order ever was made by gpa ltd in may 1989 
with 182 planes worth 94 billion that order did not include any 
747s cole said 
boeing has delivered 70 of the 747400s since the model was 
first rolled off the assembly line in january 1989 a total of 279 
of the jets have now been ordered 
the jal order brings to 138 the number of firm orders for boeing 
planes this year worth 114 billion cole said the company sold 
a record 887 jets worth 467 billion last year he said 
sumitaka kawamura of jal said that if the airline exercises all 
34 options its total investment in 747400s will be nearly 12 
billion jal plans to increase its fleet from 100 planes to 170 by 
1999 to meet an expected increase in passengers 
kawamura said jal had received five of the 747400s planes by 
march and would receive the rest by 1999 if our plans are not 
changed 
japan broadcasting corp nhk said the orders would help reduce

president bush today vetoed a bill authorizing 
funds for amtrak the nations rail passenger service protesting a 
provision to bring railroad acquisitions under new government 
scrutiny 
bush said the provision represents a step backward for the 
entire rail industry 
it was bushs first veto of 1990 he voted 10 measures last year 
and has yet to have one overturned 
an amtrak spokesman clifford black said the veto would have no 
effect on daily train operations because the railroad is working 
from money that congress already appropriated for 19891992 
but the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter 
line being developed between washington and its northern virginia 
suburbs black said the bill contained technical provisions that 
were needed for the project to open 
the bill also contained provisions that would have saved amtrak 
16 million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for 
railroad workers black said 
we vigorously support an override of this veto black said 
the provision that prompted the veto does not affect amtrak 
because it applies only to private freight rails he added 
in a veto message to congress bush criticized a provision that 
would require the government to review and approve proposed 
acquisitions of railroads by nonrailroad companies and 
organizations 
this new regulatory burden would interfere with the ability of 
the nations largest freight railroads to obtain needed capital or 
to change existing capital structure bush said 
he said that it would even subject to new scrutiny attempts to 
take over a rail line by a carriers own management or 
employees 
this requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to 
financial restructuring of the railroad industry bush said 
he said there is also adequate protection under existing law 
to protect the public interest in acquisition situations 
the provision would require interstate commerce commission 
approval of all railroad takeovers by nonrailroad companies 
the vetoed legislation sent to bush may 10 authorized the 
government subsidy of amtrak 
it envisions more than 2 billion in federal money going to the 
railroad over the threeyear period between last oct 1 and sept 
30 1992 the actual amount would be determined as part of 
congress annual appropriations process 
bush administration officials also complained that the bill 
amounted to a government subsidy that amounts to about 29 a 
passenger however the cost of the measure was not cited by bush 
in his veto message

japan agreed thursday to send trade experts to ohio 
to help promote imports from that state under a new strategy to 
reduce trade friction by dealing with individual us states 
ohio gov richard f celeste signed the agreement with chairman 
minoru masuda of the japan external trade organization which has 
decided the statebased approach is japans best bet for reducing 
its 49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
there is a difference in attitude between a state like ohio 
and washington dc celeste said in an interview he said 
ohio with nearly 200 japaneseowned companies and annual exports 
of nearly 1 billion to japan tends to see usjapan trade more 
positively than the federal government which blames japanese 
barriers for much of the trade imbalance 
masuda said he hoped the agreement with ohio would result in a 
quantum leap in import promotion and set a precedent for other 
states 
jetro will send japanese trade experts to ohio for oneyear 
stays to advise state and municipal trade officials and companies 
that want to export to japan 
their role will be particularly helpful to small and 
mediumsized companies who may have been intimidated by the 
published reports on the barriers to trade in japan said celeste 
he said the advisers will help the companies overcome what he 
called a lack of market knowledge and cultural differences that 
have prevented many us businesses from thriving in japan 
jetro has signed a similar agreement with indiana and several 
other states are being considered said fujiya yamagata the 
organizations deputy director for import promotion jetro will 
choose up to 15 states for the program he said 
not only do state governments have a more positive attitude 
toward trade with japan but also they are more knowledgeable about 
their businesses and more eager to promote them yamagata said 
about 40 states have trade offices in tokyo he said more than 
have similar offices in washington 
the program including an information network to help us 
companies increase exports will cost the japanese government 100 
million said masahisa naitoh of the ministry of international 
trade and industry 
im convinced the measures will help reduce trade friction as 
well as enhance the life quality of the japanese people by 
increasing the availability of goods said naitoh director of 
mitis international trade administration bureau 
ohio is americas thirdlargest exporting state but much of its 
output is produced by japanese companies honda sent 4500 
ohiobuilt accords to japan in 1989 more cars than ford chrysler 
or general motors state officials said 
ford in cooperation with nissan is spending 1 billion on 
minivan production facilities near cleveland japanese steel 
companies kobe kawasaki and sumitomo are joining us partners in 
investing nearly 2 billion in ohios steel industry 
during the past year japan has come under intense us pressure 
to open its markets wider to imports 
last year the united states threatened retaliation by putting 
japan on a hit list of countries with the most offensive trade 
barriers branding japan unfair in satellites supercomputers and 
forest products 
in march prime minister toshiki kaifu promised president george 
bush that easing trade tensions would be a top priority of his 
government 
the program to send experts to the states is part of an import 
expansion agreement that miti and the us commerce department 
signed later in march japan also agreed then to provide tax 
incentives for imports eliminate tariffs on about 1000 products 
and provide more lowinterest financing for imports 
in april the united states and japan agreed to reduce trade 
friction by making broad structural reforms in both economies 
japan also agreed to expand opportunities for sales of the us 
satellites supercomputers and forest products cited under 1988 
us trade legislation on april 27 the united states announced 
that japan would not be placed on the 1990 hit list

of change can commence the slowmotion suicide that is taking the 
lives of millions of americans health and human services 
secretary louis sullivan told senators 
sullivan proposed the model federal legislation to guide state 
lawmakers in creating a licensing system similar to that used for 
alcoholic beverages and in outlawing cigarette vending machines 
you cant buy beer from a vending machine he said in 
testimony prepared for the senate finance committee why should 
you be able to purchase cigarettes there 
also signs would be required at all points of sale warning that 
cigarette sales to minors is illegal 
the plan would punish violators with fines and license 
suspensions 
fortyfour states and the district of columbia have laws 
prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors but these laws are 
being blatantly ignored the secretary said 
the states that do not have laws are kentucky louisiana 
missouri montana new mexico and wyoming 
sullivan who has become the federal governments crusader 
against smoking released a report by the inspector general of the 
department of health and human services documenting the widespread 
lack of enforcement of the state laws 
the few communities that have successfully enforced the laws 
have done so by licensing tobacco vendors suspending and revoking 
licenses banning or restricting vending machines and using 
stings to identify illegal sales the report said 
vending machines account for 16 percent of the cigarettes sold 
to minors according to the report 
but the amusement amp music operators association which 
represents the vending industry said only about 9 percent of 
minors who smoke get their cigarettes from vending machines 
also 80 percent of the 375000 cigarette vending machines are 
in places where minors are prohibited or are unlikely to frequent 
such as bars offices and universities the group said 
sullivan said 90 percent of adult smokers picked up the habit as 
children or adolescents 
these young smokers account for almost all of our future 
problems he said as long as a significant proportion of teens 
view smoking as a desirable adult pleasure and become addicted 
before they can make a mature judgment we will never succeed in 
eradicating smoking 
sullivan said it is more appropriate to build on the 
legislation already on the books in 44 states than to have a 
federal ban on vending machines and a national licensing system 
he also suggested states could phase in a ban on vending 
machines by first restricting them to nightclubs and bars where 
children are not permitted 
the senate labor and human resources committee last week passed 
a 110millionayear antismoking bill that would encourage states 
to enforce laws prohibiting the cigarette sales to minors the 
measure also includes incentives for states to restrict vending 
machines and money to finance programs and advertisements to 
educate americans about the dangers of smoking 
sen edward kennedy dmass chief sponsor of the bill said 
sullivans proposal was a halfhearted plan that is certain 
to be ineffective 
the white house tactic of paying lip service to important 
national goals while rejecting federal action is irresponsible 
kennedy said in a statement we cannot simply dump our major 
national problems on the states 
the coalition on smoking or health formed by the american 
heart association the american lung association and the american 
cancer society commended sullivans effort but said his plan 
fails to put any teeth into efforts to combat a national 
problem 
sullivans plan puts the burden on 50 states to enact and 
enforce 50 different laws the group said 
charles o whitley of the tobacco institute said the proposal 
would not work any better than the similar system used to keep 
alcoholic beverages away from teenagers he also said existing 
laws arent being enforced because they lack widespread support 
laws that have popular public support are enforced he said 
those that dont have popular public support are rarely 
enforced 
sullivans model legislation suggests the legal age for buying 
cigarettes should be set at 19 to keep cigarettes further away 
from high school students 
licensing fees would be 300 for most stores but 50 for stores 
with tobacco sales below 5000 at these rates states could raise 
enough money to offset the costs for enforcement 
unlicensed sale or distribution of tobacco products would mean a 
fine of up to 1000 and jail for up to 30 days penalties for 
violations by licensed retailers and their employees would begin at 
100 for the first offense and rise to 1000 and suspension of 
their license for up to 18 months for a fourth offense licenses of 
persistent offenders could be revoked

ivan f boesky deducted 50 million in 
government penalties from his income taxes the former stock 
speculator testified thursday at the securities fraud trial of his 
onetime associate john a mulheren jr 
in boeskys third day on the witness stand the defense again 
sought to undermine his credibility and to portray him as a greedy 
man who transferred chunks of his fortune to his wife when a 
federal dragnet closed on him in 1986 
mulheren is accused of breaking the law to help boesky cheat on 
his taxes and evade federal securities laws 
the trial recessed until tuesday after prosecutors began 
questioning michael davidoff boeskys chief trader davidoff who 
has pleaded guilty to a securities charge and agreed to cooperate 
with the government testified briefly thursday that he met 
mulheren 10 to 15 years ago and had occasional social and business 
dealings with him 
earlier us district judge miriam goldman cedarbaum granted a 
request by defense attorney thomas p puccio for information about 
whether boesky took a tax deduction for the 100 million he paid to 
settle the governments sweeping insider trading case against him 
at a conference in the judges chambers boesky lawyer charles 
davidow said boesky deducted 50 million of the penalty on his 1986 
personal income tax statement boesky paid that 50 million as 
disgorgement of illegal profits he reaped from insider trading in 
1985 
davidow said he did not know whether the deduction taken as a 
capital expense was legal but he assumed boeskys tax attorneys 
or accountants had reviewed it at the time 
cedarbaum allowed defense attorneys to discuss the deduction 
during cross examination but only in attempting to show that the 
penalty against boesky was not as painful or expensive as it 
appeared 
during thursdays crossexamination by puccio boesky also 
confirmed the deduction but said he could not remember specific 
amounts of illegal profits he made in 1985 puccio claimed illegal 
profits based on insider information from investment bankers dennis 
levine and martin siegel actually totaled 187 million 
in response to another question boesky said he did not agree 
with the proposition that greed is healthy he also said he 
could not remember his words from a speech at the university of 
california at berkeley in which puccio said boesky indicated that 
one can be greedy and still feel good about oneself 
boesky also said that money had far less consequence than you 
might think to him 
puccio has been attacking boeskys credibility as he defends 
mulheren against 41 charges of conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud and recordkeeping violations 
boesky fingered mulheren a former stock speculator at jamie 
securities and others as part of his 1986 plea agreement that 
settled wall streets biggest insider trading case 
in addition to paying 100 million to settle the case boesky 
pleaded guilty to one conspiracy charge and spent two years in 
prison 
boesky was temperamental under crossexamination again refusing 
to answer many questions unless he saw documentation to refresh his 
memory 
puccio asked him a dozen times whether he had revealed to the 
government all of the crimes he ever committed boesky said he 
revealed all the crimes required under the plea bargain 
he acknowledged his net worth fell from at least 100 million in 
1986 to nearly nothing when he was sentenced in late 1987 but 
would not say whether he transferred funds to his wife as puccio 
hinted 
i do not recall any financial activities of 1986 he said 
repeatedly 
boesky denied he did anything illegal with his money to avoid 
having to pay 1 billion in damages to parties that are suing him 
boesky did admit one violation responding to puccios question 
about whether he broke the law while in prison boesky said he 
violated a rule by paying someone else to do his laundry 
there were a couple of chaps who did laundry there and i gave 
them a few quarters to do my laundry he said 
he said he did not commit any other wrongdoing while in the 
minimum security prison in lompoc calif 
under questioning wednesday by prosecutors boesky implicated 
mulheren in a scheme to raise the price of stock in the former gulf 
amp western inc so boesky could sell his 34 million shares above 
the thenmarket price prosecutors allege mulheren manipulated the 
price at boeskys request 
on tuesday boesky said mulheren agreed to keep 330000 shares 
of stock in unocal corp so that boesky could cheat on his taxes 
and meet federal requirements governing the minimum amount of 
capital his brokerage firm needed to operate

soviet president mikhail gorbachevs blueprint for 
dismantling a centrally planned economy is too timid and too 
fragmented to succeed several western analysts said thursday 
in short they criticized it for a lack of centralized planning 
you cant have halfway reform said ljubo sirc director of 
the independent center of research into communist economies in 
london 
but gorbachevs government is in a bind because it lacks the 
support of the soviet people to push for even more radical therapy 
for a sick economy the analysts said 
this is a double catch on one hand the population is opposed 
to reforms thats why gorbachev goes slowly on the other hand 
for the success of reforms you need radical change and gorbachev 
is not quite ready to take this step sirc said in a telephone 
interview 
it is as if britain decided to switch from driving on the left 
to driving on the right and proposed to do that a few cars at a 
time said david mars an economist at the london investment firm 
sg warburg and co ltd 
were likely to see that this type of reform almost gets the 
worst of both worlds mars said 
in boston harvard universitys marshall goldman agreed with the 
negative assessment but said there was very little gorbachev could 
have done about the catastrophic economic situation 
hes lost credibility his situation has deteriorated so 
much goldman said in a telephone interview the methods that 
he should have used markets family farming joint ventures 
have gotten off to such a bad start 
he said the latest economic plan moves him one step closer 
to falling from power 
andrew setton a director of morgan grenfell and co in london 
has said on bbc television that reforms to date add up to a 
certain amount of economic chaos and a lack of visible management 
of the whole economy at the center 
however pj wiles a professor at the london school of 
economics said the reform appeared to be radical economic changes 
such as largescale privatization are too complex to implement 
quickly 
the proposed fiveyear plan is a compromise between the 
decadesold centrally planned economy under which moscow set 
virtually all prices and wages and radical plans for a 
polishstyle shocktherapy to shift to a market economy over 
two years 
the government has proposed the soviet unions first national 
referendum on the plan which premier nikolai ryzhkov presented to 
the supreme soviet on thursday he warned of high unemployment and 
inflation during an expected twoyear recession 
no date for the referendum was set 
soviet lawmakers are divided about the cures for numerous 
economic ills wages are soaring in the double digits while 
industrial production has dropped significantly the country has a 
huge budget deficit is strapped with debt and has a poor credit 
rating on international financial markets 
the standard of living is about 20 percent that of the united 
states shortages are chronic and consumers wait in long 
demoralizing lines to buy the few goods available 
gorbachev has blamed public opinion for retarding reform 
the public is hostile to change sirc argued because 
gorbachevs reforms so far have made things worse and many soviets 
still rate the collective good ahead of individual wealth 
even a national vote in favor of the reform would not be a 
solution mars said when the pain starts to be evident he 
said how much legitimacy does gorbachev have 
soviet officials describe the new system as a regulated market 
because wage and price controls would be lifted gradually and not 
all state businesses would be sold 
the plan sets target price increases for various sectors of the 
economy and would at least double the price of many foods jan 1 
wages and other compensation would rise but not keep pace 
later many companies would be turned into shareissuing 
concerns that eventually would be owned by investors inefficient 
businesses would be closed and unprofitable ones would go bankrupt 
the actual transfer of ownership of companies and a sharp 
reduction of central control should occur in 19931995 ryzhkov 
said 
the soviet union should be guided by the failure of hungarys 
halfhearted reforms mars said on the other hand sirc said 
the polish government has ended up in quite a dangerous situation 
because in spite of the very radical reforms the results havent 
shown up yet 
thats why price reform and institutional restructuring like 
privatization must take place at the same time setton argued 
tuesday when gorbachevs advisory presidential council approved 
the plan 
i think the problem may be one of timing setton told the 
bbc you could run into difficulty because people will simply not 
see where the austerity is leading

lech walesa says he never thought that 
agreeing to do an advertisement supporting the us bill of rights 
would be seen as an endorsement of cigarette smoking a habit he 
kicked cold turkey years ago 
but now aides say the solidarity chairman and nobel peace prize 
laureate is contending with some unforeseen doubts in poland 
and abroad in connection with an ad he did for the philip morris 
cos makers of marlboro cigarettes 
walesas fullpage photograph and comments in praise of the bill 
of rights are appearing in such magazines as time newsweek 
business week and people they are part of a 60 million campaign 
by the tobacco food and beverage conglomerate to celebrate the 
200th anniversary of the bill of rights 
critics including some consumer and health groups have charged 
what philip morris really aims for is to subtly build appreciation 
for its products and to create a link in peoples minds between 
constitutional freedoms and the right to smoke in public 
a polish newspaper claimed wednesday that many americans are 
surprised walesa would lend his image to such an endeavor it 
is not known if this controversy is worth the fee it added 
any implied criticism of walesas judgment is sensitive now for 
his aides because of domestic politics walesa is believed to be 
laying the groundwork to run for president and critics are 
suggesting the humblyborn shipyard electrician is too 
unsophisticated to represent poland in the office 
walesas spokesman jaroslaw kurski said his boss was unaware 
of any controversy around the philip morris ads when he agreed to 
lend his name to the campaign last year 
lech walesas intention was not to advertise philip morris 
products but only to popularize the idea of freedom and civil 
liberties contained in the bill of rights kurski said in a 
telephone interview from gdansk 
the proof of this statement is that lech walesa has never 
agreed to advertise any products or anyones business activity 
the advertisement carries a quote from the union leader saying 
ive read your bill of rights a hundred times and ill probably 
read it a hundred more before i die 
asked about the ads a new york spokesman for philip morris said 
thursday they were not intended to promote the companys products 
the purpose of the advertisement is to celebrate the bill of 
rights and the sentiments and principles they represent about 
which mr walesa was more than happy to express his views and 
admiration thereof said george knox vice president of public 
affairs in a telephone interview 
the purpose of the ad campaign is not to promote our products 
no mention of our product has ever been made he said 
walesa agreed to do the campaign in return for a fee of 20000 
to 25000 to be donated to charity said kurski who said he did 
not remember the exact sum philip morris has declined to specify 
the amount 
walesa maintains a philanthropic fund administered by trustees 
that distributes money he receives for human rights activities for 
instance the 200000 he received for his 1983 nobel prize 
recently went to modernize a hospital serving workers at the gdansk 
shipyard where solidarity was born 
walesa is definitely opposed to linking the bill of rights to 
the right to light up kurski said 
although czechoslovak president vaclav havel is often seen 
fidgeting for his cigarettes and polands prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki and labor minister jacek kuron were rarely sighted in 
their dissident days without a smoke walesa prone to high blood 
pressure kicked the habit about six years ago 
he gave it up overnight and since then i have never seen him 
smoking kurski said he is an enemy of smoking 
asked whether walesa felt exploited by philip morris kurski 
said he preferred to call it a misunderstanding 
you might say the will of the two sides was not coordinated

president bush said thursday that congress is 
the primary culprit for the burgeoning federal deficit igniting 
angry democratic complaints that the white house has failed to 
provide leadership in the effort to reduce red ink 
people understand the congress bears the greater 
responsibility for this bush said at a white house news 
conference but im not trying to assign blame 
democrats called for him to come up with budget proposals rather 
than comments about blame and said his remarks are not going to 
help 
bush spoke shortly before administration officials and leading 
lawmakers held another threehour round of private 
deficitreduction talks that participants described as testy 
the bargaining is in its early stages with the two sides trying 
to agree on the size of the problem and on how much savings they 
should seek 
negotiators are moving toward a consensus to try to reduce the 
budget gap by 45 billion to 60 billion next year and from 425 
billion to 600 billion over five years bargainers said 
but disagreements remain republicans favor reductions in the 
lower end of those ranges while democrats are seeking higher cuts 
the participants said both sides agree that the higher the 
savings the more likely it is that new taxes will be needed 
threatening bushs campaign pledge to shun new taxes 
there was a substantial disparity said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn a negotiator 
administration negotiators also distributed new estimates of the 
potential costs of rescuing the nations savings and loan industry 
they showed that over the next six years the bailout could cost 
from 1025 billion to 1547 billion 
a day earlier treasury secretary nicholas brady told congress 
the government will have to borrow between 90 billion and 130 
billion to clean up the sampl mess unlike bradys figures the 
numbers released thursday included the governments interest costs 
for borrowing the funds 
the administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk 
of the problem could be resolved with the 50 billion in borrowing 
authority included in the sampl bailout bill 
the budget bargaining has been played out against a constant 
background din of political sniping 
in thursdays installment bush again refused democratic demands 
that he address the nation to prepare americans for the tax 
increases or deep spending cuts budget negotiators may propose he 
pointed out that congress has the authority to pass revenue and 
spending bills 
the president said the talks are on the right track he said 
that once bargainers produce a budget package im going to go 
out and say to the american people heres what we recommend 
democrats responded immediately 
bush should recommend what he believes is needed now said 
house speaker thomas s foley 
he has the responsibility to recommend to congress budget 
proposals said foley dwash 
democrats noted that the house approved a 12 trillion 1991 
budget on may 1 over unanimous republican opposition the gop 
decided to not seek a vote on the spending plan bush proposed in 
january calling it out of date 
weve put down a budget weve passed a budget the president 
hasnt done any of that said house budget committee member 
charles schumer dny the only thing hes done is call for a 
summit which means democrats should come help him 
schumer added statements like he said are not going to help 
the talks 
the president is elected to lead said rep vic fazio 
dcalif a member of the house democratic leadership the 
president needs to tell us what we need to do and why 
bush at the news conference said youre going to always 
have some people on the fringes sniping at you that goes with this 
territory 
republicans leaped to his defense rep newt gingrich of 
georgia the no 2 house gop leader said democrats should study 
the constitution 
if they read the constitution they will realize they have 
massive responsibilities on taxes and spending gingrich said 
the ranking republican on the house budget panel bill frenzel 
of minnesota said he believes congress bears most of the 
responsibility for the problem but that the white house can share 
some of that blame 
he said the latest partisan outbursts were merely part of the 
political process that would have little effect on the talks 
there are going to be some hurt feelings out there but i 
dont think its that big a deal said frenzel who is one of the 
budget negotiators 
the bush administration said in january that next years deficit 
would be 1005 billion citing gloomier economic numbers and 
growing costs of the savings and loan industry rescue the white 
house now says the shortfall could range from 123 billion to 199 
billion

thomas spiegel the michael milken 
ally whose columbia savings amassed the biggest junkbond hoard of 
any thrift is cutting all ties with the insolvent sampl columbias 
new chief said thursday 
spiegel a former wall street bond trader earned 9 million in 
salary and bonuses in 1985 at columbia he resigned as chief 
executive on dec 31 as the thrift incurred hundreds of millions of 
dollars in losses on its portfolio of the highyield highrisk 
securities 
he had continued to work as a columbia consultant seeking to 
find a buyer for the bonds they are valued currently at 29 
billion down from 43 billion at the end of 1988 
columbia says eight parties including bankers trust general 
electric capital corp and chicagos pritzker family remain 
interested in the portfolio 
columbias chief executive edward g harshfield has said he 
hopes to announce a sale of the bonds by early july with bidding 
in the final stages the thrift thought it best to sever ties with 
spiegel whose high pay and maverick investments in junk bonds had 
alienated regulators 
columbia revealed in a recent filing with the securities and 
exchange commission that regulators forced spiegel to return 
600000 in 1988 pay and forgo another 500000 he was to have 
received as a consultant 
tom spiegel had done a great job of teeing up this 
transaction harshfield who was traveling thursday said in a 
statement 
however everyone associated with our efforts to sell our bond 
portfolio including tom agreed that this was the right time for 
management to take full control over the bidding and negotiation 
process 
spiegel was foremost among a network of buyers at thrifts who 
purchased junk bonds from drexel burnham lambert the brokerage 
where milken pioneered use of the bonds 
drexel has collapsed into bankruptcy proceedings milken whose 
office was just a few blocks from columbias headquarters in 
beverly hills has pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay 
600 million to settle fraud charges 
columbia reported last week that nearly a quarterbillion 
dollars in retail deposits have been withdrawn since last month 
when it reported it had lost 591 million in 1989 because of the 
weak market for junk bonds 
the thrift does not meet federal requirements for capital its 
cushion against losses and it has been insolvent since feb 28 
with liabilities exceeding assets by 2156 million as of march 31 
regulators could seize it at any time but have chosen not to do 
so a move widely interpreted as a desire not to inherit the junk 
bond portfolio 
columbia officials maintain it may be possible to avoid seizure 
but many industry observers such as alexandria vabased 
financial industry consultant bert ely say there no longer appears 
to be any question of whether columbia will be seized only when 
theyre not going to come back ely said the feeling is 
they gambled recklessly and spiegels paychecks for a couple of 
years there in a row created a lot of negativism 
with twothirds of columbias deposits coming from highcost 
brokered sources and lowcost retail deposits flowing out recent 
signs of recovery in the junkbond market wont be enough to avert 
seizure he said 
the junk bond market may be coming back but i dont think 
its coming back to the extent to be able to take care of their 
problems ely said

aw clausen ending a chapter in one of 
the financial industrys most dramatic comebacks formally passed 
on the leadership of bankamerica corp to richard rosenberg 
thursday 
clausen forecast a fantastic future for the banking giant he 
led from 1970 to 1981 and returned to rescue in 1986 
problems of overexpansion at home and losses on third world 
loans sent bankamerica into a freefall in the mid 1980s the bank 
chalked up 19 billion in losses over three years through 1987 
prompting clausen to sell off many operations and focus on its core 
retail and corporate banking business 
the gears are finally going to get in mesh clausen said at 
a news conference before opening his last annual meeting as 
bankamericas chairman and chief executive officer 
clausen 67 told about 700 shareholders he is leaving with 
sadness yet with considerable satisfaction after seeing profits 
rebound to 726 million in 1988 and a record 11 billion in 1989 
he recalled the successful fight to stave off an unsolicited 
takeover offer from first interstate bancorp and the sales of 
numerous assets including the charles schwab discount brokerage 
bankamerica now is poised to flesh out its markets with more 
acquisitions of its own clausen said it is determined to be the 
premier retail and wholesale bank in the west including arizona 
nevada oregon washington and california 
clausen who headed the world bank from 1981 to 1986 said 
bankamerica also is in position to rebuild its international 
presence under the guidance of rosenberg 59 
there will be challenges said clausen who announced his 
retirement in january the issue of third world debt still looms 
large although the progress made in recent years is undeniable 
and some of our best markets continue to be targeted by a host of 
nonbank competitors operating under different rules other than 
what commercial bank labor under 
clausen said the 1990s will be perhaps the most competitively 
demanding and economically rigorous decade any of us have seen 
asked if he had any advice to the financial industry in view of 
the savings and loan debacle and numerous bank failures clausen 
put down fancy finagling and stressed an emphasis on the basics 
my advice to the financial industry is that two and two always 
should equal four he said the institutions that try to make 
five or six out of two and two are the ones that are paying the 
price 
its the fundamentals of the business watch expenses watch 
revenues quality will tell everything and be prepared for the 
downsides as well its kind of easy to do things when everything 
is going up
