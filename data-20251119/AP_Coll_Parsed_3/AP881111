ed hirsch the university of virginia english 
professor who was about as famous as any other uva english professor 
until rocketing onto bestseller lists with his book cultural 
literacy what every american needs to know is anxious these days 
to avoid the charge of arrogance 
that may be a bit harder now with the publication of his 
similarly titled sequel the dictionary of cultural literacy what 
every american needs to know houghton mifflin 1995 
cowritten by university of virginia history professor joseph f 
kett and james trefil a physics professor at george mason 
university 
the book contains 23 chapters detailing what these scholars 
believe literate americans should know about such subjects as the 
bible world and us history geography the arts science 
economics proverbs and idioms 
hirschs dictionary however more aptly resembles a patent drug 
whose manufacturer forgot to include the warning labels 
the subtitle what every american needs to know might 
logically lead one to suppose that this dictionary contains what one 
ought to know but hirsch bridles at the suggestion that he would 
ever be so arrogant or as he puts it prescriptive 
he makes a different claim for his dictionary more modest in 
his view the dictionary lays out he says the nations common 
parlance what all of us need to know to communicate with each other 
despite our ethnic or regional differences 
im interested in what brings us together as strangers he 
said in a recent conversation 
in arriving at which entries were common to americans and 
thus belonged in his dictionary hirsch said he and his academic 
colleagues first consulted the front pages of such leading news 
publications as the new york times and the washington post for terms 
and concepts in common usage from there they canvassed and quizzed 
lawyers teachers and others generally considered literate to see 
which items ought to be included in the dictionary 
the results of this winnowing process sometimes range from the 
merely idiosyncratic to a sad commentary on what we americans 
consider our cultural domain 
it includes for example the term meliorism meaning a 
belief that things are getting better knowing that may make you a 
hit at a political science convention but even the most literate of 
us will probably cruise happily through life without ever uttering 
that word 
the dictionary also manages to present two sections on world 
history nearly free of any suggestion that anything notable ever 
occurred south of the equator hirsch insisted that including such 
information in this book so prescriptively titled what americans 
need to know would have been too prescriptive 
that half of the world does however get mentioned in the world 
geography section 
so what are we to make of this dictionary its necessary to 
refer to the books brief introduction and more importantly to the 
earlier work that started it all 
in april 1987 hirsch flew to san francisco to introduce his 
original book cultural literacy what every american needs to 
know to a gathering of education writers the work featured an 
audacious 4500item list consisting of what he believed all 
americans should know to be considered culturally literate from 
star wars to the stamp act nouveau riche to neanderthal man old 
king cole to omar khayyam 
his message was clear and it struck a chord with the bookbuying 
public us schools he argued are stressing mere mechanical 
skills over content leaving millions of americans ignorant of the 
common knowledge that make up our culture 
to everyones surprise this wheres the beeftype challenge 
to the education establishment turned this scholarly book into a 
publishing sensation 
his first book and no doubt his new dictionary will continue 
to be a rallying point for those who believe schools have strayed 
from their central mission of teaching youngsters what the american 
heritage is all about 
we ought to be able to agree hirsch insists on a body of shared 
knowledge that all americans should know more to the point we must 
insist that schools teach it 
schools ought to decide on goals he said in the interview 
those goals should be content goals and not just skills goals 
they should know what kids should know at the end of first grade or 
second grade thats completely foreign now 
hirsch still receives numerous letters from teachers and others 
who applaud his message but hes also taken his share of criticism 
the left has condemned him for omitting references to minority 
groups and nonwestern cultures conservatives have said his 
literacy list lets youngsters off too easily by reducing american 
culture to slogans buzzwords and maxims 
hirsch strongly defends the idea of listing such items you 
cant have a concrete proposal without a list not to make a list is 
to be evasive 
but in light of all this hirschs claim that his dictionary 
merely describes what americans know rather than what they ought 
to sounds disingenuous 
how does one account for example for the nearly complete 
omission of the pervasive influence of television on american 
culture it might perhaps be better if young and old minds werent 
awash with i love lucy and jr ewing but leaving them out of 
this dictionary wont make it so 
more fundamentally its not at all clear that hirsch is correct 
in his central contention that there exists a consensus culture 
awaiting scholarly discovery a common american cultural language 
that can be distilled free of transient regional or ethnic 
impurities 
even less clear is that any good would result from finding it 
had he succeeded in doing so

an abrupt burst of violence has left deep 
scars in this otherwise peaceful paradise a land where only two 
murders have been reported this century 
the maldives a group of about 2000 coral islands in the indian 
ocean is better known for its picturepostcard beaches and secluded 
resorts than for foreign mercenaries battling soldiers in the 
streets 
but the islands image underwent a brutal overhaul on nov 3 
when hired gunmen from sri lanka tried unsuccessfully to overthrow 
president maumoon abdul gayoom 
maldives has been catapulted into the 20th century said ak 
banerjee indias top diplomat on the islands 
the attempt to oust gayoom was thwarted by the arrival of indian 
paratroopers but at least a dozen people were killed in male the 
capital and at least six more died on a ship hijacked by escaping 
mercenaries 
the indian paratroopers have begun withdrawing from the country 
after their quick success but some remain as a token force 
controlling the jetty on male and the international airport on 
nearby hulule island 
a week after the fighting soldiers of the maldivian national 
security service the countrys 1200man militia continue to 
patrol the narrow unpaved streets of male island 
the militias coast guard speedboats constantly monitor movements 
off anchored ships 
gayoom lives under heavy guard at the security service 
headquarters and civilians are barred from moving in front of the 
threestory white building 
before the coup attempt gayooms chauffeurdriven car moved 
freely along the streets of the capital without bodyguards said a 
resident who spoke on condition of anonymity now he is accompanied 
by bodyguards and the streets are cleared in advance 
the militia headquarters bore the brunt of the mercenaries 
attacks the buildings front is chipped by bullets windows are 
shattered and a huge hole was knocked into its 30foot boundary wall 
by a rocketpropelled grenade 
the effect of the coup will last said sajida mohammed a 
19yearold girl who said shed never seen a dead person until the 
fighting she lives down the street from the presidental palace and 
said fighting raged outside her onestory brick house for more than 
10 hours 
the people of male most government employees or fishermen 
gathered to stare at the indian paratroopers in red berets 
camouflage uniforms and black army boots 
they are not hostile but you can sense their disapproval 
said an indian major i think they dont like violence 
ismail mohammad a law student said he could find records of 
only two murders in the islands in this century one was by a west 
german tourist who killed his girlfriend on a resort he said i 
dont remember the other but know that a fisherman was killed 
the german was convicted a few years ago and banished to a remote 
island where he married a maldivian woman 
banishment has been the customary punishment for crimes but the 
mercenaries could face the death sentence gayoom told a news 
conference this week 
tourism brings in about 105 million a year in the 
maldivesabout 120000 tourists mostly from western europe and 
japan visit the islands annually 
gayoom was unconcerned about the longterm effects of the coup 
asked if the trouble could affect tourism the islands largest 
industry after fishing he said it could get better after the 
exposure we have received in the international press 
sources in the maldivian government however said the security 
of the islands would now be a priority 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said gayoom 
would discuss the situation with foreign delegations visiting male 
on friday for the ceremony installing him as president for a third 
fiveyear term 
delegations from the united states india and sri lanka are to 
attend they said 
gayoom was reelected sept 23 as is customary in the maldives 
a former hereditary sultanate that became independent from britain 
in 1965 he was the only candidate and the ballot was a yesorno 
vote ninetyfive percent of the ballots said yes

a lament by connecticuts poet laureate 
about his village grocery store may have lost the store 
november ode a poem by james merrill winner of the pulitzer 
prize has won him some admirers in the old center of this eastern 
connecticut community but also the animosity of the grocer and 
others who found his portrayal unfair 
merrill said his work was in many ways a generalized commentary 
on how community life everywhere has declined with the disappearance 
of small neighborhood stores and shops 
while several people called him to say how the poem expressed 
their own feelings about life in stonington merrill said the 
controversy has left him wondering if i shouldnt go back to 
incomprehensibility which i have been accused of 
to those who live in stonington borough which has fewer than 
3000 residents there is no mistaking the dear dim local 
grocery mentioned unflatteringly in the poem it is rolands 
market the boroughs last grocery 
there are also other references to life in the borough which was 
established in 1752 and is part of the town once a fishing village 
and major port its late 18th and early 19thcentury homes and 
shops have been rehabilitated and there are a number of antique 
stores for visitors 
ronald albamonti 39 is the first to admit that life is changing 
in the borough and that at the market things just havent been 
the same since his father roland died last year and he took 
over but he said he was deeply hurt by merrills poem which he 
views as a personal attack 
the poem reads in part 
the son picked to succeed him never lived up to the 
seigneurial old man yet his clientele 
kept brightly toeing the line of least 
resistance taking 
with a grain of salt aisle 3 all talk of heavy drugs 
and light women closing republican eyes 
to dead mouse and decimated shelves 
the padded statement 
with three large supermarkets within 12 miles of the borough 
albamonti said he decided to make rolands more like a deli than a 
fullservice grocery 
the poem was the final straw for albamonti gauging that the 
public generally shared the sentiments expressed by merrill 
albamonti said he reached a tenative agreement this week to sell the 
business and the property 
if the store is closed and the twostory building used for 
another purpose merrills poem written a year ago and published 
last month in the new york review of books will have proven itself 
to be prophetic 
plainer than day was how next summer this prime 
square footage would be developed in the usual way 
merrill who lives only two blocks from rolands market but 
hasnt been back to the store since the poem controversy erupted 
moved to stonington from new york city in the 1950s partly to be 
part of a small community 
at keanes newstand a block from rolands market francis keane 
78 who has been selling newspapers in the borough for 50 years 
said some customers thought merrill had been unfair in his criticism 
of ronald albamonti at the same time he said he agreed merrill was 
right when he spoke of the decline of community life 
it was a reflection of what is happening in small towns it is 
a different environment now years ago everybody was more friendly 
and stayed in town now they come here just to sleep and eat and 
then go off in their cars to work he said

a federal judge who aroused controversy last 
summer by ordering a female attorney to use her husbands last name 
in his courtroom says he is stepping down as an active trial judge 
im 73 years old and i think its about time i ease up my trial 
schedule said us district judge hubert teitelbaum whos been a 
federal judge since 1971 
teitelbaum said thursday his decision had nothing to do with his 
order last july forbidding attorney barbara wolvovitz to use her 
maiden name during a civil trial in his courtroom 
i conferred with the court and did this on my own volition and 
not because of anything connected with ms wolvovitz he said 
the judge had threatened to jail ms wolvovitz for refusing his 
order he later apologized and rescinded his order after outraged 
womens groups sought his resignation 
the controversy also helped prompt an investigation by the local 
bar association into sexism in the courtroom 
teitelbaum said he notified chief us district judge maurice 
cohill three weeks ago that he was stepping down as an active trial 
judge and transferring most of his cases to other judges 
teitelbaum said he would retain his courtroom and hear social 
security cases and routine constitutional appeals in criminal cases

a former mexican policeman sentenced to 240 
years in prison for a drug agents murder has been given another 15 
years for conspiring to kill a fictitious customs agent 
us district judge pamela ann rymer pronounced sentence on raul 
lopez alvarez 29 and two codefendants thursday but not without 
criticizing the prosecution for a case that pushes the conspiracy 
theory to its ultimate 
she imposed sentences far lower than what prosecutors had 
recommended 
lopez once a member of the guadalajara police homicide squad 
was convicted last month along with two mexican drug traffickers in 
the 1985 murder of us drug enforcement administration agent 
enrique camarena 
before that trial began lopez was convicted in the conspiracy 
case that stemmed from a government sting operation tied to the 
camarena investigation 
an undercover agent posing as a drug dealer lured lopez to the 
united states ostensibly to obtain information for the camarena 
probe then conducted lengthy videotaped conversations with him 
the tapes were the key government evidence in both trials during 
the talks lopez discussed details of camarenas torture murder and 
agreed to murder a customs agent at the request of the man he 
thought was a drug dealer 
according to evidence at the trial lopez subsequently recruited 
fabian jiminez martinez 23 and carlos quintero maldonado 26 who 
traveled with him from mexico to participate in the planned 
kidnapping torture and murder of a customs agent invented by the 
government 
by the sound of it it is hard to imagine a more serious 
crime said the judge but she noted there is no evidence that 
any official of the united states was in any danger at all 
as a result she said she could not impose the 30 to 40year 
sentences sought by assistant us attorney jimmy gurule 
she ordered lopez 15year sentence to run concurrently with the 
240 years he was sentenced to in the camarena case 
jimenez and quintero were sentenced to 10 years each and will be 
eligible for parole after serving a third of their sentences

george bush will bring to the white house a 
more pragmatic less ideological brand of leadership than ronald 
reagan and almost assuredly will get more involved in the daytoday 
operation of the presidency political analysts predict 
reagan saw the presidency as a pulpit for setting a national 
agenda bush seems more interested in the mechanics of governing and 
in management 
it was clear on the day reagan was elected what he would do 
freeze government hiring cut taxes and spending and build up the 
pentagon 
bush on the morning after he was elected said he would use the 
73day transition to the presidency to set the priorities for his 
administration 
while the policies of reagan and bush administrations may not 
vary much there will be a different tone in the white house come 
jan 20 
bush who promises a kinder and gentler nation says the 
stillness of the white house will be broken by the sound of 10 
grandchildren laughing and crying 
the jelly bean jars in the reagan white house probably will be 
replaced with stacks of cracklin pork rinds bushs favorite snack 
reagans favorite magazine was human events a conservative 
political journal bushs favorite is bassmaster a fishing 
journal 
bush 64 is lefthanded he likes country music vodka martinis 
and mexican food he jogs several times a week covering two miles 
in about 18 minutes 
for fun he races his cigarette boat off the chilly waters of 
maine hes an avid tennis player and fisherman and also likes to 
play horseshoes 
an episcopalian he attends church regularly with his wife 
barbara theyve been married 43 years they have five children all 
adults now and dote on their 10 grandchildren 
bush will take over from a popular president who charmed the 
nation with his easygoing manner wit and polished communications 
skills 
bush readily acknowledges hes different 
i may not be the most eloquent but i learned early that 
eloquence wont draw oil from the ground bush said last summer 
i may sometimes be a little awkward but theres nothing 
selfconscious in my love of country i am a quiet man but i hear 
the quiet people others dont 
on another occasion he said my leadership might not be the 
most charismatic but im not sure that we need a lot of razzle 
dazzle theres probably enough drama in the world already 
conservatives are worried that bush although he took a hard line 
during his presidential campaign will turn into a moderate in the 
white house 
indeed his political leanings have drifted over the years bush 
was a goldwater republican in 1966 when he was first elected to 
congress a rockefeller republican in 1980 when he ran for president 
and has been a reagan republican ever since 
i suspect that george bush will want a staff that includes sort 
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around 
him said republican consultant david keene who once worked for 
bush 
the difference between the styles of reagan and bush is that 
bush is out of an intellectual and political tradition in which the 
emphasis is on finding the right people in public service seeking 
their advice and believing that goals come out of having the right 
people in the right places said keene 
as a onetime envoy to china and the united nations as well as 
chief of the cia bush has a solid foundation in foreign policy 
reagan in his first year in office practically ignored foreign 
policy devoting his attention to budget and tax cuts bush says he 
wants a nato summit conference and an early meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
stephen hess a senior fellow in governmental studies at the 
brookings institution said that reagan is the most handsoff 
manager of the modern presidency i suspect that george bush will be 
not nearly as hands off 
echoing that theme lyn nofziger who was reagans first 
political director in the white house said bush would be probably 
more involved in the presidency and the daytoday operations but 
probably not a hell of a lot more hes not a jimmy carter or 
michael dukakis both carter and dukakis are known for their 
attention to detail 
hess said bush certainly seems to share reagans disdain for 
the press he too doesnt see being too close to the press as 
being in his interest 
though bush has promised to stay the course set by reagan hess 
said each president wants to do things differently than the person 
he succeeds 
what kind of president hell be will depend largely on things 
that happen in the next four years that are largely out of his 
control whether the iranians take over the us embassy in tehran 
or something like that hess said there are going to be some 
things that happen in the next four years in which the mettle of the 
man will have to be assessed 
on that very point bush told an audience recently that the oval 
office was a place for the moments that cut through the expected 
and the everyday and force us through action to define ourselves 
i dont know what the cutting moments will be for the next 
president bush said but i know theyll come and i know im 
ready

after a presidential election the winner gets 
to live in the white house the loser doesnt but life goes on 
even political life 
ill be working with the people of massachusetts said 
michael dukakis who would have preferred to work with the people of 
the whole country he is one of the majority of losers in recent 
years who either had a political home to return to or who wasted no 
time finding another one 
quick now name the losers of presidential campaigns in the last 
40 years and their fate after failing to get the big prize 
for the record they were republican thomas e dewey in 1948 
democrat adlai stevenson in 1952 and 1956 republican richard nixon 
in 1960 republican barry goldwater in 1964 democrat hubert 
humphrey in 1968 democrat george mcgovern in 1972 republican 
gerald ford in 1976 democrat jimmy carter in 1980 and democrat 
walter mondale in 1984 
with the exception of ford and carter who occupy a special place 
because they lost after being in the white house and mondale each 
of the losers continued on in public service mondale may yet run 
for the senate again in 1990 
harry truman who chose not to run for a second elected term 
once described the fate that awaits former presidents 
most people never stop to think about what happens to a man who 
has been president of the united states he wrote in mr 
citizen the day he is elected president he suddenly finds 
himself at the top of the world where he sits for a while holding 
the destinies of millions in his hands making decisions that change 
the course of history conferring with rulers and the leaders of 
nations 
then just as suddenly he is again at the level of john jones 
who lives next door 
carter became the man next door by moving back to plains ga 
but not as a peanut farmer instead he took up woodworking 
traveling meeting with world leaders climbing mount kilimanjaro 
becoming a visiting professor at emory university and devoting time 
to the carter presidential center where he hosts international 
conferences 
ford went straight from the white house onto the golf course he 
played in the bing crosby proam tournament the day after carters 
inauguration and has lived the easygoing life ever since 
he also turned into a oneman corporation lending his name to 
boards of directors lecturing for fees of 15000 and more 
entering into a partnership to buy radio stations and receiving 1 
million for his memoirs 
ford opposed ronald reagans 1980 bid for election and encouraged 
other challengers toyed for a time with entering the race himself 
and for one day at the republican convention looked as if he might 
be reagans choice for vice president 
mondales disappearance from the spotlight has been so complete 
that democrats rarely mention him 
oh i miss it a little he said in atlanta during the 
democratic national convention but added you know i had my say 
and i dont miss the 18hour days 
mondale practices law in washington and minneapolis and theres 
been some talk not from him that he may try to reclaim his 
senate seat from minnesota in 1990 
the other presidential losers took their lumps and started anew 
after his second consecutive defeat for president in 1948 dewey 
saidi have been graduated at a comparatively early age to the 
role of elder statesman which someone has aptly defined as a 
politician who is no longer a candidate for any office 
a year later he wrote a friend nothing could arise now or in 
the future that would lead me to be the nominee of our party in 
1952 my decision on this matter is as certain and final as death 
and the staggering new deal taxes 
after more such disclaimers he ran in 1950 for his third term as 
governor of new york and won dewey died in 1971 
stevenson the eloquent but reluctant democratic candidate in 
1952 and 1956 was appointed by president john f kennedy to be us 
ambassador to the united nations a post he held until his death in 
1965 
when he lost the second time stevenson recalled the lincoln line 
that he felt like a little boy who had stubbed his toe in the dark 
too old to cry but it hurt too much to laugh 
after losing to kennedy in 1960 nixon returned to california to 
practice law and pressures began to build on him to run for governor 
in 1962 
the real problem was that i had no great desire to be governor 
of california he wrote of his defeat in that race and yet he 
was bitter enough about losing that he snarled at reporters you 
wont have nixon to kick around anymore because gentlemen this is 
my last press conference 
it wasnt of course and nixon spent the next six years earning 
the republican chips that he would cash in to be elected president 
in 1968 
goldwater cooled his political heels for four years after his 
loss to lyndon johnson then was reelected to the senate without 
the seniority he had built up in the previous two terms 
he remained the voice of conservatives once characterizing a 
carter presidential announcement of plans for recognition of china 
as 10 minutes that lived in infamy 
humphrey who had been vice president for four years when he lost 
to nixon in 1968 spent a little while as a professor at macalester 
college and the university of minnesota then won back his senate 
seat in 1970 he ran again for the democratic nomination in 1972 but 
withdrew in the face of overwhelming odds at the partys convention 
he died of cancer in 1978 
mcgovern the south dakota senator who won that nomination 
stayed in the senate until 1980 when he lost his seat he made a 
third try for the presidency in 1984 in a primary campaign that 
lasted less than six months before he dropped out 
there is a reward for loyal service even for candidates who lose 
in 1970 nixon persuaded a millionaire twotime houston 
congressman to give up his safe seat to run for the senate against 
businessman lloyd bentsen the congressman lost 
but nixon didnt leave the loser out in the cold a month after 
the election nixon personally announced that the defeated 
congressman would be the us ambassador to the united nations 
its a great and awesome responsibility said the new 
ambassador george bush i consider myself a very lucky guy

raymond thompson mayor of this southern 
minnesota town for more than a dozen years spent the weeks before 
the tuesday election doing what he always does when his term nears 
its end nothing 
as usual he didnt file for reelection he didnt campaign and 
he didnt even bother to find out who won when he got home about 
930 pm from a deer hunting trip to northern minnesota he went to 
bed 
as usual he won 
city clerk shirley wiles called first thing wednesday to tell 
thompson he had been swept back into office with a landslide 111 
writein votes thats in a town with 310 residents including 
people and dogs thompson said 
the mayor who owns thompson livestock in racine ran and was 
elected for office once many years ago after that he figured if 
the people wanted him they could write him in if someone else 
wants the job according to his philosophy let that person have it 
but someone else has not come forward so thompson keeps getting 
elected by his account he has been mayor for either six or seven 
twoyear terms 
not running has its merits thompson said 
i dont promise them anything so i dont have to fulfill 
anything he said 
and election night party expenses are kept to a minimum 
you dont have a celebration when youre not running he said 
now that hes mayor again thompson said he plans to do what hes 
done before in the job which pays him 750 a year hell keep the 
city council on the straight and narrow

doctors say a new nuclear powered 
dualchamber pacemaker implanted in a patient for the first time is 
more comfortable than its predecessor and can last twice as long as 
those currently in use 
john sniffen 47 of clifton became the first person in the world 
to use the device according to newarks beth israel medical center 
where the 90minute operation was performed tuesday 
the new pacemaker powered by plutonium lasts from 20 to 40 
years while a similar lithium batterypowered dualchamber 
pacemaker developed in 1974 must be replaced every five to eight 
years said dr victor parsonnet who performed the operation 
though nuclear pacemakers have been available for 15 years they 
are of the singlechamber design which is less comfortable than the 
dualchamber design that imitates the hearts twostep rhythm 
parsonnet said thursday at a news conference 
when the heart beats its lower part squeezes blood into the 
upper chamber where a second squeeze sends the blood into the rest 
of the body 
the new device called a pulsarn1 alternately jolts the two 
chambers with electrical impulses adapting to the patients rate of 
activity parsonnet said 
singlechamber nuclear pacemakers which last about 16 years 
only stimulate the lower chamber of the heart and their action can 
be felt by the patient he said 
sniffen who was listed in good condition told reporters he felt 
happy to be alive and to be the first recipient of this newest 
generation of pacemakers 
wearing a white daisy in his bathrobe lapel he said that the 
singlechamber nuclearpowered pacemaker he received in 1975 made 
him feel jolts every once in a while and i was totally aware of 
it 
now i feel good a little weak from the operation but other 
than that its real nice he said 
sniffen a photocopying and facsimile machine salesman suffers 
from intermittent heart block which makes the heart stop 
occasionally and can cause fainting 
the pulsarn1 an oblong device about 2 inches wide and an inch 
thick is placed between the skin and the muscle of the chest wall 
two wires are threaded through a vein to the heart where they are 
attached to the upper and lower chambers 
parsonnet said that with its greater longevity the new device 
can eliminate the need for replacement operations reducing the 
physical and emotional stress on the patient and saving money 
theoretically this pacemaker will last a lifetime said 
parsonnet who helped implant the first americanmade 
singlechamber nuclear powered pacemaker in 1973 
patients also can avoid exposure to the xrays required to locate 
the pacemaker each time it has to be replaced said david l purdy 
president of biocontrol technology the indiana pa company that 
manufactures the device 
the new pacemaker has its drawbacks however 
hospitals must be licensed to implant the devices and patients 
have to be registered with the nuclear regulatory commission to use 
them even though experts say they present no radiation danger 
the device also costs more about 6000 compared with its 
4500 lithium counterpart it is also bigger and weighs more 
the major issue is the paperwork and the size purdy said

the nations energy chief is fending off 
complaints that a decision to select texas from among seven bidding 
states as the site for a 44 billion super collider atom smasher 
was guided more by politics than by science 
politicians from some of the losing states illinois colorado 
michigan arizona tennessee and north carolina called for a 
bipartisan review of the selection process 
the texas decision has a strong smell of white house 
politics said sen donald riegle dmich 
riegle and senators from illinois colorado and arizona sent a 
letter thursday to president reagan asking that he appoint a 
commission to review the site selection which was done by a special 
task force of the energy department the choice of texas was 
announced thursday by energy secretary john herrington 
if this project is to have the slightest chance of being funded 
it is imperative that you demonstrate that the site selection was 
based soley on scientific criteria the senators letter said 
herrington insisted that the texas site south of dallas was 
clearly superior to the others 
there was no politics in this he told reporters 
the seven states had competed intensely for the right to host the 
super collider project because of the economic benefits and 
scientific prestige associated with it 
the collider is envisioned as a 53mile underground ring that 
will use 10000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at 
energy levels 20 times what is possible in todays most powerful 
machines what happens in those collisions is expected to enable 
scientists to test the latest theories on the origins of matter 
congress has not yet agreed to build the atom smasher although 
it did appropriate 100 million this year for engineering design and 
certain research and development items 
herrington said the choice of texas was based on site geology 
regional resources and environmental criteria 
the 16000acre site some 25 miles south of dallas was the only 
one given ratings of outstanding on the most important 
considerations by the 10member site evaluation task force of senior 
civil servants herrington said 
the greatest benefit to the most people in the most states is 
what we were after and i think that after you look into this 
process read the decision documents and question us on it you will 
find out that was in fact what happened he said 
herrington said he had no knowledge of the task force evaluation 
results until last week and did not tell reagan and presidentelect 
george bush of his decision until thursday morning 
officials of some of the losing states linked texas selection to 
tuesdays election of bush who has made texas his adopted home 
i do not believe that the timing of this decision and its 
proximity to the election is a coincidence said sen alan dixon 
dill 
texas gov bill clements reacting to herringtons announcement 
alluded to political links 
the icing on the cake is the very special relationship between 
ronald reagan and texas he said 
herrington said the installation will be named the ronald reagan 
center for highenergy physics if it is built 
not every loser was ready to blame politics sen jim sasser 
dtenn said the fact that we went so far in the process is a 
tremendous complement to the state 
herrington said the department will offer technical 
debriefings to all the losing states on why texas was chosen 
the energy department estimated the cost to build the collider 
and operate it for 25 years at 108 billiton 
the benefits to texas will be enormous assuming the project goes 
ahead 3000 permanent jobs including 500 annual positions for 
visiting scientists 3500 construction jobs an annual operating 
budget of 270 million much prestige and practially no pollution 
experts said the importance of the project goes well beyond the 
local benefits it promises 
dan green head of the physics department at the fermi national 
accelerator laboratory in illinois said selection of a site was 
really a good sign that america wants to support high energy 
physics and wants to support basic research and wants to recapture a 
position they have been frittering away 
herrington said much of the leadership in highenergy physics was 
headed to western europe to participate in the existing cern 
accelerator at berne switzerland 
we need to keep those people in the united states he said

a sevenalarm fire thursday night ripped 
through a historic hotel that was being torn down and authorities 
said they suspected arson 
there were no reports of injuries 
concord fire chief richard judkins labeled the fire in the 
140room wooden highway hotel extremely suspicious 
judkins said people were seen fleeing the area as the fire broke 
out and he noted that electricity to the hotel had been shut off 
since it was sold and closed in september 
the fire broke out about 815 pm judkins said it was under 
control by 11 pm 
dozens of people gathered to watch in parking lots of nearby 
shopping centers and along interstate 93 which passes by the front 
of the hotel 
the hotel built in 1951 was a center for political gatherings 
in the leadoff presidential primary state among those who slept 
ate and headquartered their campaigns at the highway hotel were 
president reagan former presidents kennedy nixon and ford gov 
nelson rockefeller and sen robert f kennedy 
the hotel was being demolished to make way for a shopping center 
its rooms had been gutted and windows removed but the building 
still stood when the fire broke out

ronald reagan and george bush set the wheels in 
motion for the presidentelects ascent to chief executive as reagan 
left instructions for his cabinet officers and political appointees 
to resign by inauguration day and bush conferred with leaders of his 
transition team 
after a series of meetings thursday with the president the 
cabinet and his transition crew bush flew to florida for a fourday 
vacation his first postelection break 
the presidentelect planned to fish and relax in gulf stream 
fla but he told reporters he also intends to spend time on the 
telephone as he assembles his administration 
bush and reagan met with white house chief of staff kenneth 
duberstein and later attended a cabinet meeting the presidentelect 
also huddled with craig fuller and bob teeter leaders of his 
transition office 
vice presidentelect dan quayle also met with leaders of bushs 
transition team 
the bush transition office officially opens for business on 
monday in a rented suite of offices a few blocks from the white 
house but work was already under way as security guards erected 
metal detectors and a desk was set up at the entrance where a 
volunteer collected resumes from jobseekers 
the vice president made his first cabinet appointment on 
wednesday naming campaign chairman james a baker iii to be his 
secretary of state he has told reporters he wants to name the 
balance of his cabinet sooner rather than later but has set no 
timetable 
reagan and bush were applauded as they walked together into a 
cabinet meeting fitzwater quoted reagan as saying we dont even 
argue over which side of the table to sit on 
but for all the friendliness white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said reagan reminded his men we are still in charge 
until jan 20 and are still responsible for making decisions of the 
government 
duberstein told the cabinet and heads of independent agencies to 
be prepared to submit their resignations it is probably fair to 
say that all political appointees at all levels should be prepared 
to resign or depart on jan 20 said fitzwater 
president reagan of course is free to accept anyones 
resignation at any time and the presidentelect would have that 
decision to make after the 20th he said there might be cases 
where he wouldnt have someone to fill that position and would want 
someone to stay on for awhile he said 
bush on wednesday promised a brand new team when he takes 
office but treasury secretary nicholas brady attorney general dick 
thornburgh and education secretary lauro cavazos all have been 
mentioned as possible holdover appointments 
one man viewed as likely to receive a major post in the new 
administration retiring gov john sununu of new hampshire set his 
goals high he told reporters in new hampshire that he would turn 
down offers to be secretary of education or energy but white house 
chief of staff isnt on my no list sununu who campaigned 
energetically for bush and was instrumental in his critical victory 
in the new hampshire primary last february said he hadnt been 
offered any post 
on day two after the election the rumor mill was working at full 
speed 
the names spit out included former sen john tower of texas 
former rep jack edwards of alabama or former national security 
adviser brent scowcroft for the pentagon defeated maryland senate 
candidate alan keyes a former diplomat as a possible ambassador to 
the un and defeated ohio senate candidate george voinovich the 
mayor of cleveland for housing and urban development 
ohio rep bill gradisons name circulated through the department 
of health and human services as a possible replacement for otis 
bowen 
a long list of names made the rounds at the agriculture 
department including clayton yeutter currently the us trade

a former nicaraguan rebel says theres 
no chance that presidentelect george bush will renew us military 
aid for the contras trying to oust the leftist sandinista government 
i dont see any future for military aid to the ussupported 
rebels said horacio arce who himself abandoned rebel ranks in 
september under an amnesty declared by the sandinistas 
arce said thursday that many rebel military leaders feared well 
before the election that opposition to contra aid in the 
democraticcontrolled congress would continue no matter who won 
tuesdays us election 
arce 33 was known as commander mercenario among the contras 
who have waged a civil war to oust the sandinistas since 1981 he 
said he commanded contra forces along nicaraguas atlantic coast and 
the northern border with honduras 
in another development an unsigned communique issued late 
thursday in san jose the costa rican capital announced the 
formation of a new nicaraguan rebel organization opposed to a truce 
between the contras and sandinistas 
the communique said the group called the central american 
democratic revolutionary alliance opposed the ceasefire pact it 
said was agreed to by reactionary and fascist sectors of the 
contra leadership last march 
we commit ourselves to bury forever the sandinista tyranny 
the communique said 
talks on a definitive truce in the civil war broke down in 
september and each side has accused the other of ceasefire 
violations 
a rebel source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
alliance encompassed a faction of rebel fighters unhappy with the 
standoff between the sandinistas and the political leadership of the 
contras nicaraguan resistance organization 
his comments could not be immediately confirmed with other rebel 
officials 
in july seven field commanders claiming to represent 2700 
fighters on nicaraguas southern front along costa rica broke from 
the resistance after enrique bermudez the rebel military chief was 
elected to the contra ruling body 
the seven commanders denounced bermudezs election as an attempt 
by the extreme right to gain control of the rebel movement 
us military aid to the rebels expired feb 29 contras who fled 
to honduras afterwards are drawing funds from a humanitarian aid 
package 
arce said he believed 3000 to 3500 rebels were in honduras when 
he abandoned the contra cause in september 
bush has indicated resumption of military assistance would be a 
high priority of his administration wilfredo montalvan a member of 
the contras political directorate said this week the rebels would 
demand an early military aid commitment from the presidentelect 
president daniel ortega said it wouldnt be strange if bush 
requested more military aid for the contras but renewed his call for 
bilateral talks to resolve protracted problems between the two 
nations

despite deep disappointment over 
george bushs victory the wife of vanquished democratic nominee 
michael dukakis said the presidential election was not as traumatic 
as her husbands loss in his bid to win a second gubernatorial term 
in 1978 
at the time kitty dukakis pronounced the defeat to thendemocrat 
edward king a public death but she said in this election she 
felt for several weeks prior to nov 8 that her husbands candidacy 
was likely to fail 
it was unexpected she said of the 1978 defeat this was 
not totally unexpected although he had a surge at the end i think 
all of us for many weeks and some of us for longer have in our own 
way been dealing with the possibility 
i have not cried i think i must have psychologically been 
accepting defeat for a while she said thursday 
mrs dukakis reflected on the campaign and her husbands 
political future in an interview with the associated press in their 
modest brookline home a comfortable duplex building on a quiet 
street in this boston suburb 
mrs dukakis 51 said she just wouldnt begin to contemplate 
the future for her husband michael is a national figure and 
will continue to be and he will continue to speak out on national 
issues 
mrs dukakis known for her sometimes fiery temperament had no 
harsh words for the bush family she said of barbara bush i think 
shes a caring person and shell be a fine first lady 
mrs dukakis said she wont miss the secret service the 
chauffeurdriven cars and other trappings of power that go with a 
presidential campaign i really am very accepting and frankly feel 
very positive about having our quiet normal life back she said 
things arent quite back to normal at the dukakis family home 
flower bouquets were arriving in bunches from political wellwishers 
and from friends remembering upcoming birthdays a pile of at least 
a dozen of the governors telegenic red campaign ties lay on the 
floor awaiting the dry cleaners 
saying she would refuse to play monday morning quarterback mrs 
dukakis did say of her husbands campaign i was hoping he would 
fight harder in response to what dukakis people called spurious 
attacks on his record by the bush camp 
what was the most upsetting about that was that they were 
effective she said

george bushs immediate family kids spouses 
and grandchildren is so big theyve got enough for a football team 
and a baseball team at the same time 
with four sons and a daughter bush has one of the largest 
families of any president in recent times all his children are 
married and they have produced 10 grandchildren for bush and his 
wife barbara 
bush 64 himself one of five children openly boasts about his 
kids who have scattered across the country to pursue their own 
careers in business and politics 
the vice president once said the thing that made him most proud 
in life was that his children still come home 
the bushes are a tightly knit clan though the presidentelect 
acknowledges they come out of a somewhat conservative tradition 
in which people tend to be reserved about displaying affection 
publicly 
jeb bush 35 bushs second son once said their father was away 
a lot when the children were growing up but if anything ever went 
wrong in my life dad would be right there to help 
mom was always the one to hand out the goodies and the 
discipline said jeb a real estate developer in miami and until 
recently floridas secretary of commerce in a sense it was a 
matriarchal family 
mrs bush a fulltime homemaker devoted herself to running the 
house and raising her children 
though mrs bush handled family matters bush has said that his 
office aides always knew when any of the kids called no matter 
what i was doing they should be put through he said he spent 
time with the children individually on weekends and he and his wife 
always considered their responsibility as parents their top priority 
bush promised at the republican national convention in august to 
show the american people how much my great strong big family 
means to me but he was also ridiculed for referring to three 
grandchildren as the little brown ones their mother jebs 
wife columba was born in mexico 
after the convention bushs children george bush jr 42 of 
midland texas jeb neil 33 of denver colo marvin 32 of 
alexandria va and dorothy leblond 29 of cape elizabeth maine 
spread out to campaign fulltime for their fathers presidential 
election 
george jr a harvard business school graduate and independent 
oil operator in midland was a top strategist in his fathers 
campaign married and the father of 6yearold twin daughters 
george jr once waged an unsuccessful campaign for congress in 
texas he was a pilot in the texas air national guard during the 
vietnam war 
jeb a fluent spanish speaker and a former dade county republican 
chairman has frequently courted hispanic voters trained as a 
banker he once worked for texas commerce bank in caracas 
venezuela his children are george 12 noelle 11 and jeb jr 5 
in the footsteps of his father and oldest brother neil is in the 
oil business in denver a graduate of tulane university he and his 
wife sharon have two children ages 2 and 4 and are expecting a 
third early next year 
marvin who graduated from the university of virginia is the 
only child who has stayed nearby his parents in the 1980s an 
investment consultant marvin and his wife margaret have a 
2yearold girl 
dorothy leblond doro to her family is married to a 
businessman william leblond and the mother of two children 
samuel 4 and nancy 2 a graduate of the katherine gibbs school in 
boston dorothy has frequently worked on her fathers campaigns 
this year she traveled around the country in 1980 she answered 
telephones at her fathers headquarters when he ran unsuccessfully 
for president 
dorothy was not the only daughter the couples other daughter 
robin born in 1949 died of leukemia when she was three in his 
autobiography looking forward bush wrote that the death had a 
profound impact on him he said his faith helped sustain him 
to this day like every parent who has ever lost a child we 
wonder why yet we know that whatever the reason she is in gods 
loving arms

a unique exhibit of fragile nigerian memorial 
screens built by the african nations kalabari people in honor of 
their ancestors is going on display in a washington museum 
i dont know of any other people anywhere who make such 
screens said philip ravenhill chief curator of washingtons new 
national museum of african art i dont think theyll ever be 
brought together again 
the exhibit includes 11 of the 12 screens held by museums mostly 
in britain 
the screens are made of wood and fiber and the largest are about 
five feet tall they feature human figures usually with fantastic 
headgear and a cloth over their knees on which whiskey or other 
alcoholic drinks are poured by the kalabari 
they include many european elements a carving of a top hat that 
seems to come from the 1820s pieces of furniture cannon balls 
bottles of drink glasses musical instruments some appear to be 
modeled on european playing cards 
nigel barley a british anthropologist prepared the exhibits 
descriptive catalog called foreheads of the dead the exhibit 
opened today and will remain on display until jan 29 
barley said he is not sure the screens should be called art 
because their creators think of them differently 
we now live in a world where other cultures use television 
programs such as dallas and dynasty to understand their local 
missionaries he wrote 
in 1916 the screens were threatened by a fundamentalist christian 
kalabari garrick braide kalabari chiefs gave a dozen of them to a 
british district officer p amaury talbot to save them from 
destruction he sent them to britain for safety 
nigeria is the most populous nation in africa with 105 million 
people the roughly 500000 kalabari live near the atlantic coast of 
the west african republic 
once rich through trade in slaves for america palm oil and fish 
the kalabaris marshy delta lands are now literally a backwater 
barley says 
the screens may go back to their first king amachree i of the 
late 1700s though they seem to have been made later than that new 
ones rarely appeared after the late 1800s but old ones are often 
rebuilt 
but there was a new one about a year and a half ago and well 
have to see if they go on ravenhill said in an interview 
the current kalabari king is amachree x 
an accompanying exhibit consists of the metal sculpture of a 
young kalabari woman sokari douglas camp who works in london her 
sculptures include one of a kalabari ceremonial boat complete with 
paddles worked by a motor 
she had never seen one of the screens before visiting a london 
museum 
women are not permitted to look she explained

physicists hope the superconducting super 
collider will help them explain the very origin of matter itself and 
perhaps lead them to their holy grail a single theory that unites 
all the forces of nature from gravity spanning galaxies to the 
mysterious bonds that hold the proton together 
the first task of the collider if it is built may be a search 
for the higgs particle named after peter higgs of the university of 
edinburgh in scotland the scientist who first postulated its 
existence 
scientists say this subnuclear particle should emerge from 
protonproton collisions 20 times more powerful than anything 
possible today finding it would be a giant step forward in 
understanding nature 
the super collider a 53miles around machine will be the first 
atom smasher able to concentrate in a small volume of space the 
energy density that must have existed in the theoretical big 
bang origin of the universe the energy department on thursday 
selected a site near dallas for the giant machine even though 
congress has not yet decided it should be built 
the current picture of nature called the standard model is 
tantalizingly incorrect but nobody is sure just where it goes 
wrong at very high energies the theory predicts certain particle 
interactions will occur with greater than 100 percent probability 
which is an impossibility 
modifications to fix up the standard model almost always require 
extremely energetic collisions for their experimental tests 
a recent example of theorytesting on which the collider will 
build is the discovery of the socalled w and z particles at the 
cern particle accelerator in geneva switzerland in 1983 predicted 
by the electroweak theory this shows the fundamental identity 
of the familiar forces of electricity and magnetism and the weak 
forces responsible for some forms of nuclear radioactivity 
including the reactions respnsible for the suns energy 
it is the w and z particles that carry the unified 
electroweak force just as it is the familiar photon or particle 
of light that carries the electromagnetic force 
though the masses of the w and z particles could be estimated in 
advance as roughly 90 times that of the proton there is no way to 
calculate the mass of the higgs particle but scientists say there 
should be an upper limit of about 1000 times the mass of the proton 
all mass is equivalent to energy shown in the famous emc 
squared relationship first developed by albert einsten that is 
the energy of any particle is equal to its mass times the speed of 
light squared 
its convenient to speak of mass in terms of electron volts 
the energy acquired by an electron falling through a voltage 
electrons in the filament of a flashlight bulb are accelerated 
through 3 electron volts 
the mass of a proton at rest is a little less than a billion 
electron volts 
the total collision energy must be around 40 trillion electron 
volts to create a particle of 1 trillion electron volts the worlds 
most powerful accelerator at fermi lab in chicago can produce 2 
trillion electron volts whereas the super collider is designed to 
generate 40 trillion electron volts 
our lack of understanding of the masses of the various 
particles is a very deep problem the super collider central 
design group wrote in its 1986 report 
the standard model says protons and neutrons are made of smaller 
particles called quarks held together by forcecarrying 
particles called gluons 
there is no understanding why the quarks and associated 
lighter particles have the masses they do the report said 
the quarks seem to come in three families or generations one 
forms protons and neutrons and is associated with electrons another 
family not found in nature seems to be associated with the muon 
particle and a third associated with the tau particle 
there is no understanding of why there are three generations 
in fact there may be more the report said 
other possible tasks for the super collider 
electrons muons taus and neutrinos all appear to be simple 
geometric points instead of collections of smaller particles the 
super collider may be able to see if this is true 
if there is a higgs particle is it made of smaller particles 
some theories give it structure and postulate the existence of 
forces inside it analagous to those inside the proton 
another theory called supersymmetry predicts several higgs 
particles and accounts for all forces including gravity while 
giving a partner particle to every known particle this theory says 
particles are made of superstrings of fantastically small 
dimensions instead of geometrical points 
in the standard model a proton should decay spontaneously once 
in a rare while all attempts to spot such decay have failed

retail prices for dairy products will rise in 
the months ahead partly because of tight supplies at the wholesale 
level according to a new forecast from the agriculture department 
however increases in dairy prices are not likely to appear 
dramatic in comparison with other prices said the situation and 
outlook report released by usda earlier this week 
the report noted that milk prices had already increased this year 
and said the average rise in retail dairy costs for 1988 should be 
about 2 percent over 1987 levels 
the average september price for milk was 1220 for each 100 
pounds down 50 cents from a year ago but an increase of 40 cents 
over a month earlier 
markets for dairy products were already tight last summer when 
the drought began to send feed prices soaring the report said the 
reason was strong domestic use of skim milkbased products and 
rising demand for nonfat dry milk exports 
production was already easing when the drought struck the report 
said a factor guaranteed to magnify the impact of higher feed 
prices on milk production total 1988 milk production is expected to 
be around 1 percent more however than the 1987 level of 1425 
billion pounds 
since may prices of american cheese and nonfat dry milk have 
climbed 15 percent to 20 percent the report said 
these markets probably will stay quite tight until yearend 
because of low stocks strong domestic and export demand and 
weakening milk production the report said it said however that 
butter prices have had difficulty holding last summers small 
increase 
feed prices most likely will be substantially higher next year 
than they have been primarily because of the drought the report 
said it noted forecasts of corn production at its lowest level 
since the 1983 drought 
use is not expected to decrease as much as production and 
stocks may fall by twothirds the report said 
it reiterated earlier estimates of a tighter soybean market as a 
result of the drought 
as a result the report said farmers are going to have to pay 
more to feed their cows and therefore will have fewer cows producing 
milk 
the droughtcaused boosts in feed costs will be the dominant 
factor affecting milk production it said

president reagans veto of a nutrition 
monitoring bill was unfortunate and unnecessary says a group of 
lawmakers including the chairmen of the house and senate agriculture 
committees 
the presidents veto of nutrition monitoring legislation on 
election day is astonishing they said thursday in a statement 
the legislation called for a 10year assessment of the health and 
well being of americans and the american diet with special focus on 
the elderly pregnant women infants children and the homeless 
under the bill which reagan vetoed wednesday the secretaries of 
agriculture and health and human services would have reviewed in 
advance any federal advice to consumers on what to eat and what not 
to eat the provision was designed to make the federal government 
speak with one voice on nutrition and safety issues 
we believe the veto of this legislation was unfortunate and 
unnecessary the statement said we will press for passage of 
this legislation at the outset of the 101st congress which meets 
in january 
in vetoing the bill reagan said that the administration 
strongly supports the principal goals of this legislation and 
reaffirms its commitment to use existing authority to achieve these 
ends 
reagan said in a statement however that enactment of the bill 
would set up federal nutrition efforts on the wrong course 
the bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and 
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the 
bills goals reagan said 
administration opposition to the measure was well known but 
lawmakers said nonetheless the veto disturbed them 
this important bill would have required that the nutritional 
health of americans especially vulnerable groups be carefully 
monitored the lawmakers said 
it was signed by senate agriculture committee chairman patrick j 
leahy dvt and house agriculture committee chairman e kika 
de la garza dtexas as well as sens john glenn dohio rudy 
boschwitz rminn jeff bingaman dnm and tom harkin diowa 
and reps robert roe dnj george brown dcalif leon panetta 
dcalif doug walgren dpa and sherwood boehlert rny 
this simple measure would also have made federal health and 
nutrition guidance understandable the statement said 
the statement quoted scott balin american heart association vice 
president and legislative counsel as saying the presidents veto 
of the bill does a serious disservice to the health and welfare of 
the american people 
we concur the lawmakers said

the government is lifting bans on homework in 
the garment industry fulfilling a promise made in 1980 by ronald 
reagan during his presidential campaign 
the bans were imposed 47 years ago to counter widespread 
exploitation of immigrant and child laborers 
new labor department regulations published thursday and scheduled 
to take effect jan 9 would allow homework for the first time since 
the early 1940s in five garment industry trades gloves and mittens 
embroideries buttons and buckles handkerchiefs and some jewelry 
work 
labor secretary ann dore mclaughlin said lifting the prohibitions 
will provide both employers and employees with greater flexibility 
in dealing with workfamily conflicts while at the same time 
improving us competitiveness in world markets 
she said licensing of employers who hire home workers plus 
increased enforcement by her department will assure compliance with 
federal labor standards such as the minimum wage and prohibitions on 
child labor 
but unions vowed to challenge the regulations in court saying 
they will lead to a repeat of the sweatshop conditions illegally 
low pay and abuse of child labor that first prompted the home work 
prohibitions 
industrial homework has been a major deregulation battleground 
between unions on one side and the administration and business 
groups on the other for the past eight years 
the aflcio afraid of losing members or being unable to organize 
workers if they are dispersed in their homes instead of in offices 
or factories last year called for expanding the current 
prohibitions to include computer terminal work 
businesses seeking to reduce labor costs have been 
subcontracting jobs in increasing numbers to people working out of 
their homes link resources a private research firm estimates more 
than 23 million people are now performing all or part of their jobs 
at home and says the rate is growing by 75 percent a year 
the changing work force demographics demand that we provide 
employment opportunities that allow workers the freedom to choose 
flexible alternatives including the ability to work in ones own 
home mrs mclaughlin said thursday women for example have 
entered the work force by the millions 
homework she said allows both employers and employees to 
address child and elderly care and parental leaves without added 
costs 
jay mazur president of the 173000member international ladies 
garment workers union called the new regulations a callous and 
illegal betrayal of american workers and said his union will file 
suit to prevent them from being implemented 
the garment workers and other unions have twice before repelled 
the administrations attempts to lift the prohibitions on homework 
the administration won a limited victory in 1984 lifting the ban on 
knitted outerwear but only after a threeyear court fight 
mazur said the administration cynically waited for american 
working people to cast their ballots before launching what he 
called its latest sneak attack on workers rights 
with no public announcement the lame duck white house has 
given the green light to condemn countless american workers to 
exploitation and sweatshop conditions he said 
the current prohibitions were adopted between 1941 and 1943 under 
the fair labor standards act in response to reports of rampant 
exploitation of immigrant and child home workers paid on a piecework 
basis 
the general accounting office a watchdog arm of congress said 
in a report three months ago that sweatshop conditions are still 
rampant in the clothing industry 
and it quoted many state and federal officials as saying the 
problem has gotten worse rather than better over the past decade 
particularly among haitian asian hispanic and mexican immigrants 
the new regulations do not attempt to overturn state bans on 
garment industry homework in hawaii california pennsylvania 
massachusetts connecticut new york rhode island and new jersey 
about 75000 people none of them home workers are now 
employed in the five industries in which a ban on homework is being 
eliminated according to union officials 
despite the current prohibitions the bureau of labor statistics 
estimates there already are about 122000 garment home workers most 
paid on a piecework basis

congress is reluctant to raise its pay and that 
of judges and other top federal employees because voters unhappy 
with such increases often make legislators pay at the polls says 
one congressman supporting an increase 
members find it excruciatingly difficult to vote on pay 
raises rep vic fazio dcalif told a presidential commission 
we know our constituents often earn far less than us 
fazio had no formal opposition tuesday as he won election to a 
sixth term but he said his constituents still will be unhappy with 
his support of a pay increase 
my appearance here kicks off my opponents next campaign 
whoever he or she is joked fazio speaking thursday to the panel 
known formally as the presidents quadrennial commission on 
executive legislative and judicial salaries 
although no figures have been announced the commission is likely 
to approve higher pay rates next month and the raises for members of 
congress may be linked to a recommendation that outside income 
honoraria be eliminated 
if president reagan endorses the proposals in his jan 9 budget 
the raises would automatically take effect within 30 days unless 
both the house and senate pass resolutions of disapproval 
by law the commission meets after each presidential election it 
held a special session in 1986 and recommended raising congressional 
salaries from 77400 a year to 135000 a 74 percent boost reagan 
approved a pay raise to 89500 the current level 
the pay of other top officials is pegged to that level for 
example federal judges are also paid 89500 while federal appeals 
court judges make 95000 and supreme court members are paid 
110700 the chief justice is paid 115000 
fazio agreed with howard baker the former senate republican 
leader that congress has a difficult time approving pay hikes 
because of the possible repercussions from voters 
having congress vote on its own salary is the granddaddy 
conflict of interest of all times baker said youve got an 
electorate that loves to take a bite out of your leg theres 
nothing thats closer to home than examining the pay of public 
officials 
former chief justice warren burger told the panel the salary cap 
has made it difficult for the federal judiciary to retain judges 
many highly qualified fine people have declined appointments 
to federal courts because they can make far more money in private 
practice burger told the panel 
there are very few judges who are not making less today than in 
the last year of their practice even if they have been on the bench 
20 25 years he said many judges appointed at a young age later 
resign when they have children in college because they need to make 
more money he said 
he suggested that federal judges be paid 150000 this would 
stop this drain of talent burger said 
baker agreed i am well aware that most americans would not see 
a 60000 or 70000 job as compelling evidence of a vow of 
poverty he said but when a federal judge makes less money than 
a young attorney just out of law school it seems to me we have 
turned our values upside down 
burger was also supported by the american bar association whose 
president robert raven said there is a looming crisis because 
of the salary cap 
an aba survey found that 28 percent of the current federal judges 
are considering leaving their jobs because they can make far more 
money in private law practice raven said

dramatic drops in temperature under the thick 
smoke produced by forest fires support the theory that the firestorm 
of a nuclear war could lead to an artificial winter of cold crop 
failure and starvation according to a study published today 
alan robock a professor at the university of maryland department 
of meteorology said temperatures dropped as much as 36 degrees 
fahrenheit or 20 degrees celsius below normal in california 
mountain valleys that were shrouded for days last year by smoke from 
forest fires 
the studies are based on temperature readings taken in the 
klamath river canyon of northern california starting on aug 30 
1987 after lightning triggered forest fires that burned for more 
than a month 
robock said smoke from the fires was trapped in the valleys of 
the area by a temperature inversion the smoke blocked much of the 
sunlight from reaching the valley floors and the temperatures there 
dropped dramatically 
virtually all the sunlight that is not reflected by the smoke 
is absorbed before it reaches the ground thereby strongly cooling 
the ground while slightly heating the air robock wrote in the 
journal science 
temperatures he said dropped swiftly by sept 7 a week after 
the fires started the high temperature readings at happy camp a 
point near the oregon border had cooled to 626 degrees 36 degrees 
below the normal maximum for the season 
happy camp in a valley covered with smoke became much cooler 
than slater a town on a ridge to the north that was not covered 
normally he said happy camp would have higher maximum temperatures 
than slater because of the difference in elevation 
robock said tomato plants in happy camp gardens hit by the 
sudden chill and dense smoke produced no fruit and died 
following a nuclear war said robock the effect would be much 
more widespread and much more severe 
nuclear wars he said would set cities on fire causing a smoke 
that would be much denser and darker this would block out even more 
sunlight and cause an even deeper temperature drop 
forest fire smoke would not be as black as the smoke from 
burning cities where oil and plastics would burn said robock in 
a telephone interview 
he said the forest fire smoke in california actually intensified 
the temperature inversion that caused the smoke to hang in the air 
for weeks this came as a surprise 
this is one of the unknown mechanisms in the climate system 
that could make a nuclear winter even worse than we thought said 
robock 
the nuclear winter theory forecasts that an exchange of atomic 
weapons would so fill the atmosphere with smoke and particles that 
it would block sunlight and cause the earth below to cool quickly 
the chill would be enough to cause crops to fail people who 
survived the lethal blasts of heat pressure and radiation would 
then have to battle hunger and starvation as food shortages 
developed 
some of the models predict that there could be no food 
available from growing crops for a year or more said robock 
robocks study was published in todays issue of science 
published by the american association for the advancement of science

the arms control and disarmament agency cannot 
locate scores of top secret documents or 62 security safes in part 
because its records are inaccurate incomplete and out of date 
the general accounting office reports 
the gao the investigative arm of congress also said thursday 
that the arms control agencys top secret control officer in 
washington had delegated his duties to a file clerk and took no 
steps to ensure the employee protected classified material 
it said the agency had no system for controlling documents at the 
offices of the us arms reduction negotiating team and had neither 
named a top secret control officer nor created a top secret document 
log 
the report said that while acda officials maintained that arms 
control negotiators in geneva had access to few if any top secret 
documents in our review of a sample of 26 out of 256 safe drawers 
we found more than 150 uncontrollable top secret documents 
a principal finding although acda has established procedures 
for handling and controlling top secret documents at its washington 
headquarters it has no mechanism to ensure compliance with them 
acdas records of its top secret documents were inaccurate 
incomplete and out of date the gao said thus acda cannot 
assure it can account for all top secret documents 
the gao which said corrective steps are now being taken said 
acdas washington top secret control log is unreliable to assure 
classified information is adequately protected because it is laced 
with clerical and substantive errors 
the arms control agency said it could not locate scores of 
requested top secret documents that had been entered in the log the 
report said 
the general accounting office said it had pinpointed a number of 
other allegedly sloppy or lax security procedures it noted that the 
arms control agency had not changed the combinations of security 
safes as often as required and had placed some highly classified 
code word documents in improper containers 
it said its survey at acdas washington headquarters found that 
the agency could not locate 62 safes listed in its records but did 
have 42 safes for which there were no records at all 
in geneva combinations to safes were not changed when acda 
personnel using the safes were transferred or their employment was 
terminated the report said 
the geneva safe combinations were last changed during september 
and october 1987 the report said and added although many of the 
same staff returned for the round of negotiations that began in 
january 1988 some did not including one former employee under 
investigation for unreported trips to the soviet union 
the gao said the arms control agency has begun to take corrective 
actions including a may 2 memo to all staff members which stated 
that security is a priority and emphasized the need to protect 
classified information and material within the agency 
it said the arms control agency believes most missing documents 
can be accounted for and is updating records on the numbers and 
locations of safes 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign affairs 
committee which requested the gao report said it is quite clear 
there was a lapse in security the lapse was serious in nature 
but fascell said he was encouraged that acda director william 
burns apparently is committed to improving the agencys security 
practices the record to date is that acda is making every 
possible effort to implement the gaos recommendations

home prices are skyrocketing in california 
rising sluggishly in once redhot markets in the northeast 
rebounding in the industrial midwest and falling in the southwestern 
oil regions a real estate trade group says 
the national association of realtors said thursday that three 
california metropolitan areas anaheimsanta ana los angeles and 
san francisco continue to lead the nation in appreciation of 
existing singlefamily homes 
a 321 percent rise in median prices in the julyseptember 
quarter over that period a year ago kept the anaheimsanta ana area 
the costliest housing market in the nation with a median price of 
226200 
los angeles where prices rose 237 percent to 190900 had the 
second highest appreciation rate followed by san francisco which 
had a 215 percent increase to a median of 213700 meaning half 
sold for more and half for less 
in honolulu where the median price of 226000 was the 
secondhighest in the nation home prices climbed 186 percent the 
fourth best appreciation rate 
nationally the thirdquarter median resale price for 
singlefamily homes was 90200 up 39 percent from a year earlier 
the west coast is amazing who knows how long theyll be able 
to keep it up said mark obrinsky an economist with the us 
league of savings institutions 
he attributed high prices in san francisco to scarcity of 
suitable land for building and in honolulu to buying by japanese 
investors 
but sooner or later high prices likely will cut into buying and 
cause price increases to moderate as they have in the northeast he 
said 
the most expensive areas to buy a home following anaheimsanta 
ana and honolulu were in order san francisco new york los 
angeles boston hartford san diego washington dc and 
providence ri 
but appreciation rates in new york boston and hartford conn 
were below the national average the median price in philadelphia 
actually fell by 35 percent 
home prices in the new york metropolitan area including long 
island and northern new jersey rose to 192600 in the third 
quarter up 12 percent from the same period a year earlier prices 
were up 10 percent in boston to a median of 184100 
the northeast has finally cooled off after leading the nation 
in both sales and price increases over the last three years said 
john a tuccillo chief economist of the realtors organization 
among cities in the industrial heartland prices rose 177 
percent in buffalo ny the fifth best climb in the nation 140 
percent in detroit and 105 percent in chicago appreciation rates 
also were above average in grand rapids mich akron toledo and 
cincinnati ohio indianapolis st louis mo milwaukee and 
minneapolis 
rising exports causing a resurgence at us manufacturing 
plants have led to a surprisingly robust housing market in the 
midwest tuccillo said 
earlier in the 1980s the midwest lagged other regions in price 
increases and the leastcostly cities are still in that region des 
moines iowa with a median price of 55000 was the cheapest 
followed by louisville ky lansing mich oklahoma city and 
grand rapids mich 
fifteen metropolitan areas showed price declines from a year 
earlier led by denver with a 109 percent drop baton rouge la 
oklahoma city and san antonio and dallas texas all suffered 
declines greater than 5 percent 
the collapse of the oilbased economy and the overbuilding that 
had taken place continue to produce downward pressure on home prices 
in these areas obrinsky said 
but at least in the case of texas weve seen some increase in 
population along with economic growth so it looks like were 
coming to the end of this process 
home prices in houston and san antonio have risen over the past 
six months but are still below prices a year ago 
meanwhile the pace of sales in texas improved 102 percent 
between the second and third quarters after holding steady for two 
quarters 
nationally the realtors group said the resale pace of 
condominiums and singlefamily homes declined a slight 07 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 4 million units down from 
403 million units in the second quarter 
tuccillo attributed the sales decline to a slight increase in 
mortgage rates according to the federal home loan mortgage corp 
interest charged for fixedrate mortgages excluding addon fees 
known as points averaged 105 percent in the third quarter up from 
1039 percent in the second quarter 
twentyfive states and the district of columbia posted 
quartertoquarter increases in the julyseptember sales pace 
compared with 32 states showing increases in the second quarter 
twentythree states posted sales declines while two were unchanged

fred barnes an astute political analyst calls 
james a baker mr shmooze and describes him in a recent profile 
in new republic magazine as americas most overrated man 
barnes acknowledges that baker was a capable white house chief of 
staff and a skillful campaign operative but barnes says he 
has mastered the cynical trick of identifying himself with successes 
and disassociating himself from blunders 
barnes cited bakers timing in signing on as chief of george 
bushs 1988 campaign just as it was about to surge and avoiding 
blame for a big tax increase and lack of success in trimming the 
trade deficit as treasury secretary 
the writer also raised questions about the briefing books 
prepared for jimmy carter in his 1980 debate with ronald reagan that 
mysteriously fell into the hands of reagans campaign team 
the appellation mr shmooze refers to the smooth texans 
careful cultivation of reporters who nearly uniformly give him high 
marks for judgment barnes thinks if bush who was managed by his 
friend baker had not dropped out of the 1980 republican campaign he 
might have wrested the presidential nomination from reagan that year 
all that and current campaign sleaze allegations aside baker if 
confirmed by the senate as the 61s secretary of state will have the 
advantage of extremely close ties to the president he will hit 
the ground running said george p shultz who has been in the job 
for more than six years 
bush gave baker a quick start by selecting him more than two 
months before the new administration takes over next tuesday baker 
is expected to be at the state department to begin transition 
discussions and to start learning the job 
his background in foreign policy is limited he has never been to 
the soviet union or to the middle east with the exception of saudi 
arabia his views on us relations with moscow and on the 
israeliarab dispute are unknown 
his political skills are not 
baker played a key and possibly critical role in 1981 in winning 
the senates approval for the saudis to purchase advanced radar 
planes from the united states the vote was 5248 baker offered 
vague legal assurances that israels security would be safeguarded 
in order to entice a handful of wavering republicans to the white 
houses side 
it was one of the few arms sales battles any administration has 
managed to win over israels supporters 
baker is experienced in international economics has traveled to 
17 countries and regularly attended national security council 
meetings at the white house as reagans chief of staff and as 
treasury secretary 
the skills of persuasion with which he is credited by barnes and 
other political observers could be a valuable asset in diplomacy 
personal relations often smooth the way for strategic objectives 
but clearly bakers biggest asset is his close tie to bush who 
will be in charge of foreign policy baker should not have any 
problems figuring out what the boss has in mind nor is he likely to 
be harassed by the white house or national security council 
the threequarters of a mile from the state department to the 
white house has seemed a much greater distance to some recent 
secretaries of state 
at work in their office on the seventh floor they sometimes had 
to wonder what sort of advice the president was getting from the nsc 
or from white house staffers 
cyrus vance frequently clashed over policy with zbigniew 
brzezinski who was president jimmy carters security adviser the 
disagreements contributed to vances decision to resign in april 
1980 although the main reason was carters attempt to rescue 
american hostages through an unworkable military operation 
henry kissinger had no such problem under president richard 
nixon and for a while under president gerald ford he held the dual 
jobs of secretary of state and security adviser kissinger wasnt in 
the habit of disagreeing with himself 
bakers ability to get along with people will help him besides 
the chances are he would work well with the two men who apparently 
are the leading candidates for the nsc job brent scowcroft who 
held it under ford and winston lord the us ambassador to china

the reagan administration is making a new 
attack on the supreme courts landmark roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion proposing that the justices use a missouri case 
to reconsider the 15yearold ruling 
the proposal came in form of a brief filed with the court 
thursday by solicitor general charles fried who said the missouri 
case represents an appropriate opportunity for the justices to 
review the 1973 decision 
proabortion groups said the timing of the proposal two days 
after the general election was political 
i guess they were afraid to do this before the election because 
they thought they might lose the votes of millions of women said 
eve paul planned parenthoods vice president for legal affairs 
but a justice department spokesman loye miller insisted that 
the timing was dictated by extended internal discussions at the 
justice department on the question and by extensive staff work that 
had to be completed 
frieds brief said the missouri case is free of procedural 
defects and implicates a number of the legislative choices 
foreclosed by roe v wade 
the solicitor generals brief noted that the reagan 
administrations views on abortion were expressed in a case in june 
1986 when the government urged that roe vs wade be overturned 
the high court at that time voted 54 to reaffirm the earlier 
ruling but since then another reagan appointee has joined the 
court justice anthony kennedy antiabortion groups hope that will 
tilt the courts balance and lead to scuttling of roe vs wade 
which held that a woman has a constitutional right to an abortion 
missouri officials want the supreme court to reinstate a strict 
state antiabortion law struck down in july by a federal appeals 
court which said the statute was invalid under roe vs wade 
the missouri law declared that human life begins at the moment of 
conception and said no public funds employees or facilities could 
be used to perform or assist in an abortion or to counsel a woman to 
have an abortion 
a key issue in the missouri case is whether it is 
unconstitutional for a state to declare when human life begins the 
missouri law did that and went on to declare that unborn children 
have protectable interests in life health and wellbeing 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in july struck down those 
declarations saying that it is unconstitutional for a state to 
adopt one theory of when human life begins 
douglas johnson legislative director for the national right to 
life committee said the missouri case offers the high court a 
chance to address important issues such as limits on abortions late 
in pregnancy even if it decides not to use the case to overturn roe 
vs wade 
were not predicting that the court would use this case as the 
occasion to overturn roe vs wade johnson said thats a 
possibility of course we would be delighted if they did 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for the feminist majority 
called frieds brief a sneak attack on womens lives 
she said that if the reagan administration gambit works 
precedents could be established to put at risk not only legal 
abortion but the pill and iud 
they didnt have the guts to do it before the election added 
molly yard president of the 160000member national organization 
for women its a sneaky lowdown thing theyve done 
there was extensive discussion at the top levels of the justice 
department over whether it would be advisable for fried to file a 
brief in the case at all or whether the solicitor general ought to 
file a full brief outlining arguments for overturning roe vs wade 
said a high department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
instead a middle course was favored in which the solicitor 
general would characterize the missouri case as an appropriate 
vehicle for the justices to reconsider roe vs wade said the 
official 
the missouri case william l webster vs reproductive health 
services was brought to the attention of newly installed attorney 
general dick thornburgh shortly after he started work last summer 
the justice department official said 
thornburgh as governor of pennsylvania was involved in the 1986 
case in which the court upheld roe vs wade on a 54 vote 
that case thornburgh vs american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists involved a pennsylvania law passed in 1982 that would 
have required physicians to record intimate details about a woman 
seeking an abortion 
pennsylvania legislators acknowledged that the law frequently 
characterized as the toughest antiabortion law of any state was 
intended to discourage women from an abortion 
that law too was struck down as unconstitutional

a federal judge says he rejected defense 
motions to dismiss the case against former presidential aide oliver 
l north because they reflected a cynical attempt by the irancontra 
defendant to put himself above the law 
us district judge gerhard a gesell wrote that norths 
arguments for dismissing charges he lied to thenattorney general 
edwin meese iii and destroyed national security council documents 
reveals a skewed attitude toward our form of constitutional 
government 
north is accused of obstructing a november 1986 presidential 
inquiry into the irancontra affair by lying to meese about 
diverting usiran armssale profits to nicaraguan rebels 
north contends he committed no crime because meese lacked legal 
authority to question him 
ours is a country governed by the rule of law gesell said in 
his opinion released thursday there is nothing in the 
constitution federal statutes or applicable decisions which 
warrants this cynical approach to merely state it provides the 
response this court must reject it totally 
in a separate development the justice department touched off a 
confrontation with independent counsel lawrence e walsh by 
objecting to a brief he filed in norths case it said the brief 
mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles but walsh 
issued a statement rejecting the accusation 
gesell said north in seeking to have the case against him 
dismissed was arguing that he had the absolute right to lie to 
obstruct such inquiries and to remove or destroy official nsc 
records because he had not been warned that if he did so he might be 
indicted 
north fails to appreciate the gravity of his alleged conduct 
the judge said 
north did in fact have fair warning that mendacity and 
obstruction coupled with destruction of official documents was 
illegal the judge wrote 
defense lawyers argued that north couldnt be prosecuted for 
giving false answers because he wasnt subpoenaed or placed under 
oath by meese and that the attorney generals inquiry was not a 
pending proceeding before a government agency 
if the allegations in the indictment are factually correct 
north breached the high public duty with which he was entrusted 
when questioned by meese on nov 23 1986 the judge said 
the court will not give judicial approval to the suggestion 
that he was free in these circumstances to place his personal 
interests or objections to national policy ahead of the public trust 
he had accepted gesell wrote 
walsh the independent counsel will need only to prove at 
trial that the specific questions posed to north by the attorney 
general were precise and material to this legitimate presidential 
inquiry and that north purposely lied the judge said 
the retired marine lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring 
with former national security adviser john m poindexter and arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord to illegally divert usiran armssale profits to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
gesell also indicated he would deny similar motions to dismiss 
charges that north lied to congress in 1985 and 1986 about his role 
in covert aid to the contras 
no date has been set for norths trial the first of four 
separate trials ordered by the judge 
in its court filing critical of walshs oct 25 pleading in the 
north case the justice department asked gesell for permission to 
articulate clearly and definitively the executives view of the 
law which governs the relationship between the president and the 
congress 
the department said it wanted to submit a friendofthecourt 
brief because walshs pleading contains numerous statements that 
are inconsistent with previously articulated statements of the law 
by the department of justice and other executive branch agencies and 
departments 
it said the prosecution brief supporting the charges against 
north mischaracterizes basic constitutional principles of 
separation of powers and executive branch authority 
a department assertion that it was not consulted by walsh before 
he filed his brief drew a tart response from the prosecutor 
the independent counsel rejects the suggestion that it should 
have solicited the views of the department of justice or that it has 
mischaracterized the law walshs office said in a statement 
while the independent counsel does not object to the submission 
of legal views by the department it strenuously opposes this wholly 
unjustified 11thhour motion for an extension of time the 
statement said 
justice department officials refused to describe the specific 
legal disagreements with walsh which they plan to outline in the 
pleading they want to file by nov 25 
the department appeared to be objecting to walshs statements 
about congress role in foreign affairs and how north and poindexter 
impaired legislative oversight by secretly financing the nicaraguan 
rebels at a time when such aid was banned by the boland amendment

presidentelect george bush has been given the 
glum news that the budget deficit in the next fiscal year will be 
21 billion higher than the reagan administration had previously 
estimated 
that information means that bush will be facing an even bigger 
budget headache when he takes office on jan 20 
the new deficit estimate was presented to bush and president 
reagan during a cabinet briefing thursday on the administrations 
final budget submission to congress 
joseph wright jr director of the office of management and 
budget said the omb now estimates that the deficit for the 1990 
fiscal year which begins next oct 1 will be 132 billion 
substantially higher than the 111 billion deficit estimate omb made 
just three months ago 
officials said the main factors boosting the deficit estimate 
were the drought which slowed economic growth this year and 
higherthanexpected interest rates which raised the cost of 
financing the 26 trillion national debt 
the grammrudman balanced budget laws deficit target for 1990 is 
100 billion which means that 32 billion in budget cuts will be 
needed to close the gap between revenues and spending 
achieving such sizable cuts in the face of congressional 
opposition to further reductions in domestic programs will present 
bush with major political problems 
during the campaign bush sidestepped specifics on how he would 
deal with the budget deficit by touting a plan for a flexible 
freeze bush said he would allow government spending to grow only 
enough to match inflation within the overall freeze selected 
programs could grow while others would be cut 
however bush avoided providing details on what programs he would 
cut in order to free funds for increases that he promised to make in 
education child care and health care for the poor 
the budget document reagan sends to congress on jan 9 will 
reflect his decisions presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
however officials said it was likely that bush would rewrite at 
least part of the document once he takes office just as reagan did 
in 1981 when he submitted his own budget to congress in place of the 
budget left behind by president carter 
officials refused to comment on reports that the final reagan 
budget will call for substantial increases in defense spending and 
steep cuts in domestic programs as a way of providing bush with the 
opportunity to present a kinder gentler budget blueprint once 
he takes office 
omb spokeswoman barbara clay said that reagans final budget 
would not include any tax increases something the president has 
consistently opposed or seek to trim social security benefits as a 
way of meeting the 100 billion grammrudman deficit target 
we have some difficult choices ahead on where to cut 
spending she said 
with estimates on future deficits rising many private economists 
are convinced that bush will be forced to accept some type of tax 
increase despite his oftrepeated opposition to new taxes during the 
campaign 
as examples of pressure for increased spending they point to 
public demands that the government do more in the fight against 
drugs and to estimates topping 50 billion for the cost of bailing 
out hundreds of insolvent savings and loan institutions 
house speaker jim wright on thursday said that the first signal 
on whether bush is serious about reducing the budget deficit is 
likely to come from his appointment of two members to the national 
economic commission a bipartisan advisory group created to come up 
with a blueprint for eliminating the budget deficit 
bush criticized the commission during the campaign as a device 
for raising taxes but wright said if bush is serious about dealing 
with the deficit he will weigh carefully his appointments which 
are expected to be made soon 
will they be pragmatic people will they be realistic people 
will they be people dedicated to finding a true solution to this 
enormous budget crisis wright dtexas asked i think that may 
be his first signal 
also providing hope to some that a resolution can be reached in 
the sevenyear budget deadlock is the widespread expectation that 
bush will name richard darman as the new budget director 
darman a longtime aide to former treasury secretary james a 
baker iii is considered a pragmatist who would seek to work with 
congress in crafting deficitcutting solutions 
wright repeatedly refused to offer his own view on how to make 
the needed budget savings although he said he had many questions 
about how bushs flexible freeze would work 
i have an open mind and im willing to listen to the 
presidents refinement of exactly how he interprets the meaning of 
that phrase wright said

george bush is spending his first days 
as presidentelect on a fishing golf and tennis vacation while 
aides back in washington work on the transition that will put his 
administration in the white house next year 
as he arrived at the west palm beach airport thursday night bush 
said the transition effort couldnt be going better in answer to 
a reporters shouted question 
the presidentelect was upbeat as he arrived in the balmy beach 
community where he and his wife barbara were met by gov bob 
martinez bush said he was feeling great 
asked about a morning meeting wih the leaders of his transition 
team craig fuller and robert teeter bush laughingly said it had 
been absolutely fantastic and then disappeared into his 
limousine 
he is staying at the vacation home of friend william stamps 
farish iii a 49yearold multimillionaire who made his fortune in 
the oil business the home is located in the exclusive community of 
gulf stream near delray beach 
bush was accompanied by his press spokesman steve hart and two 
other aides but none of his transition or campaign advisers 
however the presidentelect was expected to conduct some business 
by telephone and told reporters wednesday that he would spend time 
considering cabinet appointments 
but aides insisted that this vacation was intended for rest and 
relaxation after a grueling campaign 
hes very interested in relaxation time hart said 
bush brought his fishing pole and golf clubs along and told 
reporters earlier he intended to do some surf fishing and fly 
fishing 
bush also enjoys jogging and tennis but hart told reporters not 
to expect much in the way of reports or photo opportunities of the 
presidentelects activities 
on thursday bush met with president reagan and the cabinet and 
attended the presidents briefings with his national security 
adviser and his chief of staff

debt relief and the future of us 
military bases will top manilas agenda with george bush but 
suspicions remain about the presidentelect because of his past 
support for ferdinand marcos 
also president corazon aquino is a friend of defeated 
presidential candidate michael dukakis from the years when she and 
her late husband benigno aquino jr lived in the boston suburb of 
newton 
filipino politicians and influential political commentators made 
no secret of their belief that the massachusetts governor would have 
been more sympathetic to philippine interests especially from the 
daunting 28 billion foreign debt inherited from ousted president 
marcos 
but mrs aquino said she looked forward to working with bush and 
his new administration 
i think that for my part i can work with president bush with 
the bush administration and i hope that he has seen what we have 
done here as far as restoration of democracy is concerned she 
said 
bushs image in manila has been largely defined by remarks during 
a visit to the philippines in 1981 during a dinner speech the vice 
president effusively praised marcos for his adherence to 
democratic principles 
bush is widely perceived as one of the last major figures in the 
reagan administration to abandon marcos before he fled to hawaii in 
the february 1986 popular uprising that toppled his 20year 
administration and propelled mrs aquino to power 
as a sign of that suspicion numerous commentators have 
speculated that bush may quash racketeering indictments in new york 
city against marcos and his wife imelda 
the aquino camp is reported worried about the fact that 
presidentelect bush like outgoing president reagan is close to 
the exiled marcos couple in hawaii wrote columnist ariel bocobo 
in the manila standard 
speculation in local political circles goes that reagan or 
eventually bush himself may call off all indictments against the 
marcoses in the us and give them a presidential pardon 
us diplomats in manila have repeatedly sought to assure the 
filipino public that judicial moves against marcos will not be 
influenced by politics and that washingtons support for mrs aquino 
is bipartisan 
us diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity say filipino 
suspicions of bush would be mollified if the new administration 
makes good on president reagans promise last month of a 
multinational aid package for the countrys sluggish economy 
foreign secretary raul manglapus told reporters that prospects 
for such a plan may have brightened since bush has promised to 
continue reagan foreign policy 
commentator amando doronila said bushs naming of former treasury 
secretary james baker as his new secretary of state indicates a 
closer integration of the third world debt issue in the conduct of 
us foreign policy 
doronila writing in the manila chronicle noted baker as 
treasury secretary authored the baker plan for us policy 
regarding third world debt the plan called for restructuring 
interest payments and providing new loans for debt servicing 
something manila has sought from creditor banks 
philippine debt is politically entwined with the contentious 
issue of the six us military bases the keystone to american 
military power in the western pacific 
the lease on those installations including clark air base and 
the subic bay naval base expires in september 1991 any extension 
must be under a formal treaty ratified by twothirds of the 
23member senate where opposition to the bases is strong 
us diplomats say they would like to begin preliminary talks on 
a new treaty by mid1989 to allow time for negotiations and for 
ratification by both nations senates by the 1991 deadline 
a recent review of the current agreement took nearly seven months 
to complete and us diplomats believe negotiations on an entirely 
new treaty could drag for more than a year 
a recent public opinion survey by ateneo university found about 
75 percent of the 1200 respondents favored retaining the bases 
but opposition is strong among small but influential groups in 
the intelligentsia and the media diplomats believe those groups 
could sway public opinion away from the bases if washingtons moves 
on debt relief and other issues disappoint filipinos 
bush may only make americas domination of our country its 
officials bullying ours more obvious wrote the nationally 
circulated newspaper malaya americans and their presidents are 
expected always to look only after their own interests it behooves 
us to look only after ours

fiftysix years later albert furrer is 
finally the last man of the last mans club 
the 96yearold civic leader today will get that bottle of mumms 
champagne the club bought after the 32 world war i veterans reunited 
in 1932 and decided they would get together every veterans day 
what else can i say but that im here until the end furrer 
said thursday from his bed at brookside hospital where he had a 
malignant growth removed this week 
i came through floods fires wars my god you come through 
it all and i dont know if its an honor or a sort of curse 
added furrer who lives in a nearby nursing home 
its rough to see all your friends die off old people dont 
make many new friends 
the champagne bottle encased in a decorative mahogany box is in 
the hands of the family of the clubs former secretarytreasurer 
victor parachini who died in february at age 89 for the past four 
years he and furrer had been the clubs only surviving members the 
bottle is signed by the clubs original 32 
after all these years the champagne is mostly a symbolic trophy 
having gone sour a new bottle will accompany it so furrer can hold 
the clubs final celebration today veterans day which was called 
armistice day before 1954 
the last mans club was modeled after similar efforts by 
revolutionary war veterans to maintain camaraderie said furrer its 
members all came from contra costa county across the bay from san 
francisco 
the clubs name was derived from the members intention to leave 
a sizable endowment to the last surviving member through annual 
dues at one point its coffers held 30000 
but the money was spent on the veterans day parties and on 
helping members who had fallen on hard times and the fund dried up 
about five years ago 
they were all the kind of fellas youd be proud to be 
associated with furrer recalled it was a great thing when we 
were all together it was the kind of deal where we all helped each 
other 
furrer who ran a stationery store for most of his life and 
served on numerous community boards remembers the annual club 
parties as classy evenings of entertainment and food 
besides those affairs members attended funerals of deceased 
members 
the one thing club members never did was talk about the war said 
furrer explaining that the group didnt want to relive their 
wartime experiences despite their desire to stay in touch 
betty maffei of the contra costa county historical society will 
put the mumms on display in nearby pleasant hill after todays 
celebration and keep it for posterity 
i dont think its exactly an honor to be the last man 
said maffei its something they all laughed about back then but 
as the day got closer i think the survivors stopped laughing as 
they realized they might be that guy 
furrer had no tips to offer on how to live a long life 
god only knows how i made it he said laughing i never 
abused myself but i didnt lead a holy life either

fbi director william sessions says the agency 
expects to finish within a few weeks the first phase of a criminal 
investigation of the computer virus that attacked and disabled 
computer networks nationwide last week 
sessions said thursay the bureau is examining a wide range of 
possible criminal violations 
a 23yearold cornell university graduate student has told 
friends he created the virus a tiny program that spreads throughout 
computer networks and disrupts them 
sessions however told reporters there has to be a very 
careful and deliberate look at it before i would ever go out and 
suggest that a person had actually committed a crime 
you have to move carefully and i think weve done it properly 
in this case he added 
sessions said investigators are trying to determine whether 
statutes concerning wire fraud malicious mischief or unlawful 
access to stored communications may have been broken 
earlier this week the fbi said it was focusing on a federal law 
that prohibits fraud or related activity in connection with 
computers the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 
cornell student robert t morris jr has told friends that he 
created the computer virus that disabled thousands of computers last 
week but didnt intend for it to spread as it did 
we often look at intent as being knowing and intentional doing 
of an act which the law forbids and knowing that the law forbids it 
to be done sessions said but we also have other statutes which 
deal simply with knowingly doing something 
the maliciousmischief statute to which sessions referred carries 
a maximum 10year prison term for anyone who willfully interferes 
with the use of any communications line controlled by the us 
government 
the unlawfulaccess law makes it a crime to prevent authorized 
access to electronic communications while they are in electronic 
storage it carries a maximum sixmonth jail term if malicious 
destruction or damage is not involved the virus incapacitated 
computer systems leaving their owners unable to gain access to data 
stored in them 
on another subject at a news conference sessions said the fbi is 
examining allegations by some hispanic fbi agents that they have 
been targets of retaliation within the bureau for testifying in a 
classaction suit alleging harassment of hispanic agents 
he said we are looking at the allegations which are now part 
of the suit pending in us district court in el paso texas

thomas m folks head of a virology laboratory at the federal 
centers for disease control in atlanta said thursday the finding 
confirms that the aids virus is able to infect and reproduce within 
stem cells immature cells that grow in the bone marrow and develop 
into components of the blood 
this is probably a cell that helps set up the reservoir of 
infection and allows the disease to become chronic and linger for a 
long period of time folks said in a telephone interview 
folks said he and a team of researchers used a new technique to 
purify stem cells from bone marrow extracted from a cadaver the 
stem cells then were exposed to human immunodeficiency virus or 
hiv that causes aids and then cultured in test tubes 
after 40 or 50 days the cells in the culture became packed 
with hiv virus folks said the cells became bags of virus 
the infected cells developed into macrophages a type of cell 
that fights disease by engulfing and digesting bacteria or other 
infective agents 
folks said for people infected with aids macrophages may develop 
into bags of virus that actually can spread the infection to 
other parts of the body

as a 10yearold jewish boy eric 
mayer watched nazi henchmen destroy his home and loot family 
treasures the memory still haunts him a halfcentury later 
i saw the synagogue burning our home was destroyed and books 
and precious family heirlooms were thrown out the window 
desecrated mayer said of the night of nazi terror 50 years ago in 
his hometown worms 
sitting thursday in the reconstructed synagogue mayer said i 
remember that night as if it were yesterday 
mayer of wayne nj was visiting his birthplace along with 40 
other members of the new yorkbased international memorial committee 
for jewish victims of nazism 
the occasion for the visit which included several wormsborn 
jews from america was to mark the anniversary of the kristallnacht 
pogrom of nov 910 1938 worms is 35 miles southwest of frankfurt 
on that night nazi thugs destroyed hundreds of synagogues 
thousands of jewish homes and businesses and sent 30000 jews to 
concentration camps ninetyone jews were killed 
the next morning my mother brother sister aunt grandfather 
and i were sent to a jail with no facilities about 70 people were 
crammed into a small room mayer told the associated press 
it was called protective custody to protect us from the 
german people who were supposedly rightfully angry at us mayer 
said in english 
his father was sent to nazi concentration camp buchenwald and 
neither he nor mayers mother survived the holocaust their names 
are now on a plaque in the synagogue along with other jews from 
worms who were systematically murdered 
mayer later fled to france and eventually the united states he 
said he has since visited worms and other west german cities many 
times often because of his work as a business consultant 
before the holocaust worms had a rich jewish tradition dating to 
the middle ages 
the 11thcentury synagogue and adjoining mikvah or ritual bath 
draws tourists from across the country a small jewish museum has 
been built next to the synagogue and the complex is on a street of 
old houses preserved from the neighborhoods long era as a jewish 
quarter 
but worms jewish population was nearly wiped out during the 
third reich city officials say only one or two jews are living in 
worms today compared to a prenazi jewish population of about 1100 
committee president gerhard spies 72 of mamaroneck ny lost 
numerous relatives during the nazi period he said his father a 
president of worms former jewish community was a broken man 
after internment in buchenwald 
one important goal of the committees visits to worms spies 
said was to talk to west german youth 
i have made peace with myself and when i come here i visit 
schools and talk to young people i tell them what a jew is what he 
thinks about different things and exchange viewpoints spies said 
spies said he has been disappointed by most young peoples lack 
of knowledge about jews 
this may be changing now but even two years ago i found a lack 
of understanding in many issues concerning israel and judaism even 
the teachers themselves were sometimes misinformed spies said 
another committee member said the situation among youth is 
changing for the better 
theres been a definite change an improvement as time goes 
on said henry r huttenbach a history professor from brooklyn 
ny theyre asking questions healthy questions the dialogue 
shows a larger number of concerned kids 
the committee has participated with the city of worms in several 
events marking kristallnacht and similar events throughout west 
germany but few seemed to think it will have a lasting effect 
the extravaganza on national television served the politicians 
but it isnt the quiet patient work needed at the community 
level huttenbach said

wilkesbarre pa ap leroy bishop spent 20 years wondering 
what happened to his best buddy from nam at one point bishop 
heard john farruggio had died 
his wondering ended this year when using a new computer data 
base being compiled by the veterans of the vietnam war bishop 
learned his army friend lived only six miles away in a philadelphia 
suburb 
we got a little bit heavier and a little bit grayer hes still 
the same guy said bishop a printer who lives in levittown 
findavet as the program is called allows veterans to look for 
those they knew in vietnam even if all they remember is a nickname 
or a military unit 
michael milne executive director of the veterans of the vietnam 
war said societys acceptance of vietnam vets in the last few years 
has led to an increased number of veterans wanting to find lost 
acquaintances 
its a healing process said milne who runs the national 
organization from his home just outside wilkesbarre in northeastern 
pennsylvania 
findavet has a computer data base with more than 3000 names on 
it and can also search for names among the organizations 32000 
members milne said 
veterans of the vietnam war has tried to increase the size of the 
data base by putting fliers for the program in its newsletter and at 
veterans administration hospitals 
only vietnam veterans are allowed to use findavet and to ask 
for a search vets must enter their biographical information into 
the system a 1 donation is requested for each search 
if several people fit the description the veterans of the 
vietnam war sends a list of names and addresses if no one meets the 
description they hold the request for three months and try it again 
more than 400 requests have been made since the service started 
in january milne said 
john sepcoski jr coordinator for findavet said he hopes the 
program eventually has 1 million names in the computer data base a 
total of 26 million soldiers from all services were in vietnam 
bishop and farruggio saw combat together in vietnams central 
highlands 
we had so many good times and bad times said bishop who 
tried over the years to find his friend but hadnt a clue as to his 
whereabouts until he asked for a search in the findavet program 
last fall he learned that farruggio lived in nearby newtown 
i called him i said do you know who this is its bish he 
just couldnt believe it was me bishop recalled 
when they got together they first swapped humorous anecdotes 
such as the time when farruggios rucksack caught in a tree during a 
firefight and he couldnt jump for cover 
then bishop said they talked about things he hadnt even 
discussed with his wife 
you cant really talk about it to anybody unless theyve been 
there bishop said adding that he and farruggio now get together 
every week or so 
ronald green who runs a vietnam veterans outreach center in 
philadelphia said a meeting between vietnam buddies can help them 
psychologically 
it can be positive finally discarding the old emotional 
baggage said green an army veteran who served in west germany 
after 15 or 20 years they start thinking about people who were 
instrumental in their survival green added 
director milne who served as an army ranger in the mekong delta 
from 196769 had the idea for the program and enlisted the help of 
sepcoski who was a student at nearby kings college at the time 
unlike world war ii milne said most soldiers in vietnam were 
sent over as individuals for oneyear enlistments 
one of the things everybody failed to do was swap names 
addresses and phone numbers when you rotated out you just rotated 
out milne said 
milne too has been trying to find a lost friend his first 
sergeant from vietnam 
he was a hoot and holler he was a confidant he was a good 
friend milne said

bernard akana spent only 1323 on his 
campaign for mayor of hawaii county to his incumbent opponents 
100000 made no speeches and was so obscure some media 
organizations couldnt get his name right 
he won of course his campaign secret sitting in a hilo 
shopping mall and chatting with voters 
akana a 69yearold republican had no endorsements no campaign 
workers and nine backtoback defeats in county and state elections 
between 1968 and 1984 his only campaign adviser was his wife ina 
who ran for office herself in 1986 
two weeks before the election he told reporters he knew little 
about budgeting for the county that constitutes the island of 
hawaii taxes and housing programs and that he had little interest 
in those matters 
on tuesday the retired electric company worker edged incumbent 
democrat dante carpenter by 19886 votes to 19088 
carpenter had been criticized for what some voters considered an 
arrogant style as well as for his support of island development and 
because he paid his wife 15500 to administer a campaign survey 
the poll was scrapped and the money returned after the payment was 
disclosed 
akana said he wants honesttogod affordable housing the 911 
emergency telephone system a kona municipal golf course 
transportation traffic safety drug control equal opportunity for 
the handicapped and a bayfront beach park 
not bad for a candidate who just a few days ago was so obscure a 
honolulu newspaper called him benjamin akana a television reporter 
on election night referred to him as akuna and a hilo radio 
announcer wednesday kept calling him akaka

fiftysix years later albert furrer is 
finally the last man of the last mans club 
the 96yearold civic leader today will get that bottle of mumms 
champagne the club bought after the 32 world war i veterans reunited 
in 1932 and decided they would get together every veterans day 
what else can i say but that im here until the end furrer 
said thursday from his bed at brookside hospital where he had a 
malignant growth removed this week 
i came through floods fires wars my god you come through 
it all and i dont know if its an honor or a sort of curse 
added furrer who lives in a nearby nursing home 
its rough to see all your friends die off old people dont 
make many new friends 
the champagne bottle encased in a decorative mahogany box is in 
the hands of the family of the clubs former secretarytreasurer 
victor parachini who died in february at age 89 for the past four 
years he and furrer had been the clubs only surviving members the 
bottle is signed by the clubs original 32 
after all these years the champagne is mostly a symbolic trophy 
having gone sour a new bottle will accompany it so furrer can hold 
the clubs final celebration today veterans day which was called 
armistice day before 1954 
the last mans club was modeled after similar efforts by 
revolutionary war veterans to maintain camaraderie said furrer its 
members all came from contra costa county across the bay from san 
francisco 
the clubs name was derived from the members intention to leave 
a sizable endowment to the last surviving member through annual 
dues at one point its coffers held 30000 
but the money was spent on the veterans day parties and on 
helping members who had fallen on hard times and the fund dried up 
about five years ago 
they were all the kind of fellas youd be proud to be 
associated with furrer recalled it was a great thing when we 
were all together it was the kind of deal where we all helped each 
other 
furrer who ran a stationery store for most of his life and 
served on numerous community boards remembers the annual club 
parties as classy evenings of entertainment and food 
besides those affairs members attended funerals of deceased 
members 
the one thing club members never did was talk about the war said 
furrer explaining that the group didnt want to relive their 
wartime experiences despite their desire to stay in touch 
betty maffei of the contra costa county historical society will 
put the mumms on display in nearby pleasant hill after todays 
celebration and keep it for posterity 
i dont think its exactly an honor to be the last man 
said maffei its something they all laughed about back then but 
as the day got closer i think the survivors stopped laughing as 
they realized they might be that guy 
furrer had no tips to offer on how to live a long life 
god only knows how i made it he said laughing i never 
abused myself but i didnt lead a holy life either

killed 10 people when calm returns to the country 
col ahmed daku military governor of northwestern sokoto state

a decade ago california spurred a nationwide tax revolt with a 
ballot question that slashed rates now activists are proclaiming 
the birth of another west coastinspired citizens movement the 
insurance revolt 
the message from california voters is enough is enough 
said consumer activist ralph nader of proposition 103 a ballot 
measure that cut insurance rates now were getting calls from 
other states and other groups interested in doing the same thing 
it is a prospect that insurance industry officials dont relish 
especially since rebellious rumblings have already been felt in the 
new jersey and massachusetts legislatures 
california is known in our business as a bellwether state 
said ron howorth a vice president with the national association of 
independent insurers it has always had the position of a 
trendsetter and that concerns us 
proposition 103 which was narrowly approved tuesday requires 
all insurance companies writing car home and business policies in 
the state to roll back rates to 1987 levels and then cut premiums by 
20 percent 
californias proposition 13 approved by voters in 1978 cut 
local property taxes in half the initiative set off a tax revolt 
that led to similar propositions in other states 
in approving proposition 103 voters rejected other ballot 
initiatives offered by legislators trial lawyers and the insurance 
industry all of whom spent about 76 million to sell their plan as 
the solution to the states skyrocketing car insurance rates 
insurance industry officials say proposition 103 offers no way 
for insurers to cut their costs and will force some companies out of 
business other insurers are contemplating limiting their business 
in california 
the state supreme court delayed the propositions implementation 
thursday at the request of insurance companies to give the court 
time to consider whether the measure is constitutional 
i certainly hope for the benefit of other states that they 
dont follow californias lead said george tye executive manager 
for the association of california insurance companies it was a 
totally irresponsible and destructive initiative 
yet industry officials admit the time is ripe for car insurance 
to become an issue in many of the nations big cities where car 
thefts insurance fraud automobile costs and auto repair and 
litigation resulting from accidents have sent insurance rates 
soaring 
some even admit the industry brought proposition 103 on itself 
whenever a solution was offered that harmed the insurance 
industry the insurance industry was very good at blocking the 
legislation said manuel valencia a spokesman for proposition 
104 the california insurance industrys defeated plan to offer some 
rate relief 
concern over insurance rates has spurred action elsewhere 
florida voters rejected a ballot question tuesday that would 
have set a 100000 ceiling on certain personal injury lawsuits the 
bill supported by businesses and doctors was aimed at reducing the 
cost of liability and malpractice insurance 
pennsylvania consumers grumbled loudly last month when state 
officials voted to triple to 24 a special assessment on car 
insurance policies so loud was the outcry that the increase was 
delayed and legislation was introduced to deal with insurance 
problems 
in arizona a special legislative panel will hold hearings next 
month to find ways to cut car insurance costs now the fifth highest 
in the nation 
teachers in several kentucky cities marched out of class to 
protest their higher medical costs under the states new 
selfinsurance program the state went to selfinsurance after 
insurers demanded an increase in premiums 
new jersey which had the highest rates in the nation was able 
to offer modest rate cuts with legislation passed last month that 
allows drivers to buy less expensive policies with greater 
deductibles 
last week massachusetts no 1 in the nation in the rate of 
claims passed similar legislation to reduce insurance rates 
officials said the impetus came after the drivers were hit by 
retroactive rate increases 
we were not having any success until then said paula gold 
massachusetts secretary of consumer affairs the consumers became 
outraged and really let the legislators know it 
industry officials say the california vote is likely to get 
insurers moving in the direction of reform 
they are in a mood to go back to the table and work something 
out said howorth this thing in california will only encourage 
us to work with the lawyers legislators and consumer groups 
but nader thinks the movement toward compromise may be too late 
what happened in california is going to encourage the people to 
apply a little law and order on the insurance industry by 
themselves he said

three workers killed in an explosion while 
checking gas levels in a sewer tunnel were acting as guinea pigs 
says a safety advocate who calls the projects fatality rate the 
nations worst per dollar spent 
im absolutely convinced that this particular tragedy is 
inexcusable and absolutely avoidable joseph kinney executive 
director of the national safe workplace institute in chicago said 
of thursdays accident it did not need to happen 
a city official defended safety procedures and said 
investigators did not know what triggered the blast 
in all six workers have died since 1986 in the 21 billion 
deeptunnel sewer project the largest public works project in 
wisconsin history last march the federal occupational safety and 
health administration cited the contractor for inadequate 
ventilation 
the explosion occurred around 9 am after the three went into 
the tunnel to check a high level of methane a gas formed by natural 
decomposition officials said the methane had caused workers to 
evacuate 
rescue workers who had to clear explosive fumes and remove 
twisted wreckage while contending with poor lighting and kneedeep 
mud took eight hours to remove the bodies 
it was a mess said fire capt bert bemann it was like 
hell 
the victims were identified as ronald kohne 49 a tunnel 
superintendent from big sandy tenn rick sochacki 34 a safety 
officer from south holland ill and tony bell 25 of sturgeon 
bay a shift foreman 
autopsies were scheduled for today to determine what killed the 
men district attorney e michael mccann began an investigation 
saying the number of deaths on the project had concerned him 
earlier osha also sent an investigator to the site 
it seems to me that the three men were the modernday 
equivalent to canaries in cages in the old coal mines said 
kinney referring to the old practice of using canaries to check for 
lethal gas levels in coal mines if a canary died the miner knew to 
get out 
kinney questioned why remotecontrolled monitoring equipment 
could not have been used instead of sending the men back into the 
tunnel after a methane problem had already caused workers to 
evacuate it 
kinney said the project has the worst death rate per dollar spent 
of any such waste water or heavy construction project in the nation 
his nonprofit institute which is funded by foundation grants and 
contributions compiles statistics on workplace safety 
but shelia payton chairwoman of the milwaukee metropolitan 
sewage district defended the projects safety policies 
these were inspectors these were trained people payton 
said they went in there with the proper equipment to check the 
gas levels 
the connector tunnel is to carry water into a deep tunnel 
designed to serve as an underground reservoir for sewage at times of 
high flow and to prevent overloading of district sewage treatment 
facilities 
payton said sensors on a drilling machine initially detected a 
pocket of methane the work crew was evacuated and the tunnel was 
ventilated after 15 minutes the three men went in with detectors 
to see if work could resume 
everything went according to the procedures that had been laid 
out beforehand she said 
payton said officials would adjust procedures to prevent a 
recurrence once they determined the explosions cause 
sa healy co of mccook ill the connector tunnel contractor 
has a good safety record she said 
however osha spokesman gerald cunningham said his agency fined 
the company 620 for inadequate ventilation in part of a tunnel last 
march that violation and lesser ones were immediately corrected 
cunningham said 
none of the three previous deaths on the project involved gas 
one worker fell in an air shaft another was hit by a falling rock 
and the third was crushed in a conveyor system 
the 11year project which is about half completed is the result 
of a federal lawsuit by illinois over the occasional flow of raw 
sewage into lake michigan when milwaukees treatment plants become 
overloaded by heavy rainfall 
payton said the project is critical to protecting the 
metropolitan areas water quality this project must go on she 
said

republican us rep connie mack iii was making 
plans for his transition to the senate today as rep kenneth 
buddy mackay and democratic party officials considered a legal 
challenge to macks narrow victory 
mackay refused to concede thursday even after absentee ballots 
gave mack a clear victory saying he and his attorneys were 
discussing voting irregularities that he might challenge 
macks victory decided the last of this years 33 senate races 
it means the democrats will have a 5545 majority a gain of one 
seat in the new senate 
mack who replaces retiring threeterm democratic sen lawton 
chiles declared himself the winner when the absentee votes were 
announced 
its very exciting said the 48yearold grandson of the 
baseball hall of fame manager its been long its been tough 
but i felt all along that my message of more freedom free markets 
freedom from taxes freedom as an objective of our foreign policy 
would come through clearly 
president reagan who did a television satellite feed for macks 
campaign monday called the cape coral congressman to congratulate 
him 
the aps latest tally showed mack with 2044575 votes or 50 
percent to mackays 2014924 votes also 50 percent that gave 
mack a margin of nearly 30000 votes more than enough to avoid an 
automatic recount that would be triggered if the difference was less 
than onehalf of 1 percent about 5000 absentee votes still were 
out in bay county a mack stronghold in the panhandle 
we may have to ask the fat lady for an encore said mackay 
campaign manager greg farmer somethings screwy with those 
numbers 
mackay 55 estimated that up to 170000 senate votes may be 
missing in the states four largest counties he said there were 
more votes in those counties for the secretary of state and 
insurance commissioner races than for the senate 
mackay told reporters his lawyers would study possible challenges 
to the vote such as a courtordered statewide recount or a manual 
count of a random selection of ballots in the four counties 
we dont intend to drag this out he said at his ocala home 
i regret this has come up in this campaign but i do feel that i 
owe it to those people whose votes were not counted 
farmer said the way races were listed on the ballots may have 
confused voters in some counties or there may have been computer 
problems 
there are some some irregularities out there right now we cant 
explain right now said state democratic party chairman charles 
whitehead weve talked to some people who are very knowledgeable 
in the way this is done who agree with us 
mack said he wasnt worried about legal challenges and he said 
he wanted to reach out to buddy mackay 
nobody should be put through what weve had to experience 
mack said they ran a tough campaign and theyve got to be 
disappointed 
mack also wasnt worried about relations with democratic us 
sen bob graham who during the campaign labeled mack an 
ideological wacko 
bob is a professional and hes very good at what he does im 
confident we can work together said mack who in october 1987 
launched what appeared to be a longshot campaign to fill chiles 
seat

florence holman returned from duty in 
vietnam as an air force nurse 22 years ago only recently has she 
begun to suffer crying jags and remember the death and disfigurement 
she saw there 
holman is one of the 10000 women called the invisible 
veterans who served unnoticed and whose longhidden pain is 
apparently just emerging 
in the last few years women veterans say they have unlocked 
longlost memories of the war found fellow female vets and consoled 
one another 
there are women who have never told anyone not even their 
husbands that they were in vietnam holman said thursday on the 
eve of veterans day 
of the 10000 women who served in southeast asia during the 
vietnam war 7484 were in vietnam according to the veterans 
administration most were nurses 
they were greatly outnumbered by the 34 million men who served 
in southeast asia during the war the 350000 women who served in 
world war ii and even the 34000 women in world war i 
but they saw some of the worst of war 
they saw intense and gross casualties without relief said 
psychologist jessica wolfe of the veterans administration hospital 
in boston modern technology is such that men who in past wars 
would have died on the field instead made it to hospitals and died 
there 
wolfe treats women suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder 
but said only a handful of female veterans have come to her for help 
a lot of women dont want to talk about what they went 
through she said 
wolfe said vietnam war nurses were often forced to make 
lifeanddeath decisions because of a lack of medical help and to 
assist in amputations and other difficult surgery for which they had 
no training 
many of the veterans feel helpless said psychologist andrea wild 
of the vietnam vet center in springfield 
they would have a patient whose face was half blown off and 
about the only thing they could give him was morphine she said 
wolfe said a study scheduled for release next month puts the rate 
of posttraumatic stress disorder among women veterans at 9 percent 
compared to 15 percent for male veterans and 2 percent for the 
general population 
women with the disorder show the same symptoms as men such as 
terrifying nightmares and numbed feelings wolfe said folklore 
has it that even florence nightingale suffered ptsd she said 
the women wolfe has treated tell of flying into vietnam alone and 
remaining isolated the entire time of fighting constant sexual 
harassment and sometimes rape of getting the message from the 
military and civilians that they werent true combatants despite 
their work and the hostility they faced on their return 
holman who is a nurse in ludlow just north of here served in an 
intensive care unit at an air force hospital at cam ranh bay in 1966 
she saw few casualties but vivid memories surfaced recently of 
deaf speechless men suffering battle shock and of a roomful of 
seriously injured soldiers she saw on a weeklong trip to saigon 
my initial impression was that everybody had nice clean white 
dressings the reality of missing limbs tubes tracheotomies didnt 
hit me holman said 
two years ago at the vietnam memorial in washington she found 
herself crying uncontrollably she wept again last year when a 
vietnam war memorial was unveiled in new york and discovers tears 
on her face whenever she sees a television program about vietnam 
after a while you cant keep denying anymore holman said 
especially when confronted with so many things that make you think 
of vietnam

the communist government approved draft 
bills to permit other political parties and adopted a resolution 
allowing conscientious objectors to perform alternative military 
service a spokesman said 
the government will present draft bills on the right of 
association and assembly to parliament next month government 
spokesman gyoergy marosan said thursday 
according to the official news agency mti justice minister 
kalman kulcsar said the right of association bill would allow 
individuals and legal entities to set up political parties trade 
union interest representations and other social organizations 
however he said another law still being drafted would regulate 
the establishment of political parties the news agency reported 
this law will determine the status of political parties and will 
probably be included in the new constitution the agency said the 
new constitution is not expected to be ready before 1990 
there has been extensive debate in hungary in recent weeks over 
what some communist leaders and political analysts in hungary see as 
the inevitable development of a multiparty system 
the media have carried comment by a wide variety of people on how 
viable a multiparty system would be under certain conditions 
kulcsar reportedly said if the law on associations is approved by 
parliament it would amount to the recognition of a multiparty 
system 
but the leading role of hungarys only political party the 
hungarian socialist workers party will remain until the new 
constitution is adopted the news agency reported 
east germany czechoslovakia and poland each have small parties 
that are formally independent of the ruling communist party 
however these small parties have virtually no voice in their 
political systems 
a second draft bill permitting the right of assembly would 
regulate the holding of demonstrations 
kulcsar said any planned assembly or demonstration must be 
reported to authorities three days in advance to maintain order 
police would only have the right to ban an assembly if there is 
intention to commit a crime or violation of the rights and freedoms 
of others the news agency reported 
however kulcsar said in the event of a ban an appeal could be 
lodged which would have to be handled in three days 
the government passed a resolution allowing conscientious 
objectors to work at an alternative service doing mostly manual 
labor for 36 months mandatory military service lasts 18 months 
hungary would be the second soviet bloc country to introduce an 
alternative service after poland 
it was not clear from the agency report who would be entitled to 
do an alternative service so far only jehovahs witnesses and 
members of the church of nazarene have been permitted to withdraw 
from military service on grounds of religious belief

palestinian leaders meeting this weekend 
as a legislature in exile are likely to declare an independent state 
in the israelioccupied territories senior plo officials said 
the 450member palestinian national council at a threeday 
meeting that begins saturday could make its most important 
decisions since the arab league created the organization 24 years 
ago 
the move could have a profound effect on stalled middle east 
peace efforts 
but gains in last weeks israeli elections by the right which 
opposes giving up any of the occupied west bank and gaza strip lend 
new uncertainty to the palestinian issue 
senior officials of the palestine liberation organization said 
the council will endorse a plo call for an independent state in the 
occupied territories which israel captured from jordan and egypt in 
1967 and are home to 15 million palestinians 
they said plo plans to establish a provisional government 
probably will be delayed and the timing left to the palestinian 
national councils 70member central council which oversees 
resolutions the national council includes nonplo palestinians 
pragmatists in the plo and such moderate arab states as egypt and 
jordan say declaring independence will be little more than symbolic 
unless the national council produces a realistic political program 
that can gain international support 
plo leaders have considered a declaration of palestinian 
independence for years but the idea has gained impetus during the 
11month israeli uprising during which at least 310 palestinians 
and 10 israelis have been killed 
the rebellion has won widespread sympathy and forced plo chairman 
yasser arafat to make hard political decisions he had postponed for 
years or risk losing the leadership of increasingly frustrated 
palestinians 
arafat got another jolt july 31 when king hussein of jordan cut 
legal and administrative links with the west bank which jordan 
governed from 1950 to 1967 and palestinians in the gaza strip 
husseins action left the plo little choice but to assume 
responsibility as the sole representative of the palestinians a 
status endorsed by years of arab summits 
an important question to be answered in algiers is how far the 
national council will go toward recognizing israel 
declaration of an independent state will have its legal basis in 
un general assembly resolution 181 of 1947 which proposed 
splitting palestine into jewish and arab states 
basing the declaration on the resolution could be interpreted as 
implicit recognition of israel but that is unlikely to satisfy 
conditions israel and the united states have set for dealing 
directly with the plo 
some of arafats key aides and his soviet allies believe more 
explicit recognition will overcome us opposition and force israel 
to accept peace talks 
un security council resolution 242 calls for israels 
withdrawal from occupied land in return for recognition of its right 
to exist in secure borders 
another reasom for us and israeli opposition to direct 
negotiations is the 1968 plo covenant calling for armed struggle and 
the destruction of the jewish state 
some prominent palestinians said the plo could get around that 
quietly without a formal declaration by forming a provisional 
government that would write a constitution to replace the covenant

with a few disgruntled exceptions ellis 
county residents quickly began celebrating their newfound fortune as 
the beneficiaries of the energy departments 44 billon 
superconducting super collider 
residents rushed to town squares to pop champagne corks shortly 
after learning thursday that the county just south of dallas would 
get the giant atom smasher which drew bids from 20 states 
about the only thing that might be similar to this would be 
being named the city to host the next olympics saysid david 
lander the mayor pro tem of midlothian population 5000 
jubilant texans cheered in celebrations at the county courthouse 
and chamber of commerce here the midlothian city hall and the ennis 
town square as high school bands played and bank signs flashed the 
good news 
its a very festive mood said lander everyone is very 
excited its obviously going to be a tremendous boost to our north 
texas economy 
the collider is envisioned as a 53mile underground ring that 
will use 10000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at 
energy levels 20 times what is possible in todays most powerful 
machines the goal to probe more deeply into the origins of matter 
for many north texas residents the project will bring new jobs 
a more technical work force a stronger housing market better 
schools and prosperity for an area once known exclusively for its 
cotton farms and ranches 
if built the super collider would bring an estimated 4000 
construction jobs and 3500 permanent jobs to waxahachie population 
18000 
the super collider is an investment in our future said phil 
bronson of waxahachie the educational level will come up once we 
get all the technical people in here 
ive been through a lot of land speculation in this county but 
nothing like this said real estate agency owner tom crabb the 
land values here could double inside the ring maybe more 
that prospect didnt excite everyone however including dale 
wilburn a 38yearold machinist whose family will have to sell its 
land to make way for the collider 
i understand they want to break down atoms and see whats 
inside them he said i dont really understand much more it 
would be better if they built a pipeline so we could get gas up 
north to those yankees 
for others the potential changes hold more personal importance 
bob hamilton who lives in a rural development outside 
waxahachie looks forward to getting a cafeteria others dream of a 
new hotel a mall a couple of nightclubs or a rumored disneystyle 
amusement park 
crabb a former waxahachie chamber of commerce president said he 
expects large corporations to set their sights on waxahachie arbys 
already has staked out a parcel of land he said 
its estimated the project will pump 270 million into the local 
economy but the windfall would spread far beyond the county line 
this will change our economic and educational base for all 
time says dallas city councilman jack evans who led a committee 
to lure the project to texas you will see many awards and 
benefits coming out of the research that will be done here 
the energy departments decision got some negative reviews 
especially from the six other finalist states that didnt get the 
plum politicians from some of the losers illinois colorado 
michigan arizona tennessee and north carolina called for a 
bipartisan review of the selection process 
some locals also expressed reservations about the project 
personally i hate to see this come but it cant be helped 
said county sheriffs lt joe bob underwood my brother and i own 
a ranch and this always has been a lot of farm land but thats 
going to change now 
dick erwin who bought a house south of red oak four years ago 
said he had mixed emotions im glad the countys going to get 
it erwin said but im sorry im going to have to lose my 
house

swastikas and other antisemitic slurs were painted at a jewish 
cemetery in rhode island a denver synagogue and a jewish student 
building in new york as thousands marked the 50th anniversary of 
nazi rioting that heralded the holocaust 
officials said thursday the spray painting at the 95yearold 
cemetery in woonsocket ri took place about tuesday the day 
before synagogues churches and schools worldwide remembered 
kristallnacht or the night of broken glass 
on nov 9 1938 nazi thugs went on a rampage killing scores of 
jews and setting ablaze more than 1100 synagogues in germany and 
austria 
a woman visiting bnai israel cemetery on tuesday found her sons 
headstone among the approximately halfdozen covered with nazi 
crosses swastikas and other symbols the main road to the cemetery 
was inscribed with slogans such as die jews and the german word 
for jew juden 
today when i went to the cemetery it was a very terrible 
reminder of things that have happened to us in the past temple 
bnai israel president edith wittes told a congregation assembled 
for a kristallnacht memorial service wednesday 
police were uncertain whether the desecration was linked to 
kristallnacht but the timing raised questions said detective sgt 
ronald bashand 
in addition to the nazi symbols there were other images with 
possible links to satan worship such as skulls and an inverted 
cross with its arms turned down 
the form of the desecration was clear the symbols are here 
everything that made kristallnacht possible said rabbi joel 
chernikoff the sickness that made adolf hitler possible is alive 
and well today in our own community 
among the other phrases spraypainted on the road were death 
and napalm 
in denver swastikas were spraypainted on a synagogue and a 
jewishowned delicatessan wednesday night said saul rosenthal 
director of the mountain states office of the antidefamation league 
they are an unfortunate occurrence on this date he said i 
really doubt that its coincidental 
swastikas were spraypainted on the front door and sign in front 
of the synagogue at the hebrew educational alliance rosenthal said 
at steinbergs deli swastikas and the slogan jude die were 
painted 
we see this stuff all too regularly rosenthal said but it 
was very very emotional to have it take place on this particular 
day 
at the state university of new york at binghamton ny 
swastikas and antisemitic slogans were found thursday morning 
spraypainted inside the office of the jewish student union 
i cant even find the word for it its so hurtful said 
james oppenheim president of the student group 
there was no sign of forced entry at the office and sanctuary 
housed in the basement of the colleges student union oppenheim 
said the group has about 200 students that coordinate activities on 
the campus 
i think its politically motivated because they didnt do any 
damage that we can see oppenheim said 
the group had sponsored a candlelight vigil wednesday night to 
commemorate kristallnacht

playwright michael weller set moonchildren 
his first theatrical success in the turbulent 1960s it was 
followed some five years later by loose ends which examined 
several lives in the more selfsatisfied if not any more satisfying 
1970s 
now weller delves further into the past with spoils of war a 
highly personal not entirely convincing family drama of the 
mid1950s with emphasis on the word family the play opened 
thursday at broadways music box theater 
a perfect family is what 16yearold martin wants more than 
anything else a student at one of the best progressive schools in 
the east he returns to new york in an effort to reunite his 
divorced parents andrew a cold reserved photographer and elise 
a beautiful harddrinking hardliving romantic 
andrew and elise are leftover leftists trying to shake off the 
effects of the depression world war ii and sen joseph mccarthy on 
their lives they never quite succeed their love lives are equally 
messy neither has ever had a satisfactory relationship as the 
drama takes pains to point out martin has been the only lasting 
reminder of their marriage 
weller has called the play semiautobiographical but the 
center of spoils of war is not the teenage martin or his father 
but the flamboyant elise shes the most compelling character weller 
has ever written and in kate nelligans tonycaliber performance 
the woman comes vividly to life 
miss nelligan wearing a striking red wig invests a lot in the 
character and her hard work pays off elise is funny in a 
selfmocking way sexy vulnerable and most important intelligent 
even recognizing her own flaws 
the character is not above borrowing money from her best friend 
a stillcommitted revolutionary named emma played with endearing 
sweetness by a terrific character actress named alice playten elise 
also is willing to flirt and more with lew a midwest building 
contractor if he builds for her a house where she can finally make 
a home hes played with hayseed authenticity by kevin orourke 
almost as interesting as elise is martin the son who is not 
above manipulation if it will help bring his parents together 
christopher collet mixes the right amount of boyish charm and 
deviousness to bring it off 
spoils of war tells martins story a shattering of his dream 
about the perfect mother and father 
its andrew the father who remains the problem in the play 
when the drama was performed last spring at offbroadways tiny 
second stage the man was something of a cipher weller has made the 
role larger but not altogether clearer 
andrew played with an icy intensity by jeffrey de munn tries to 
justify his desertion of wife and child as well as his political 
causes his answer which wont be revealed here drew 
unintentional laughter from the audience at the shows last preview 
it doesnt help that andrew also comes equipped with a young 
girlfriend penny blandly played by marita geraghty the actress is 
not as effective as annette bening who had the role at second stage 
as a result its simply no contest between the wimpy girlfriend and 
the dominating but desirable exwife when they finally have a 
showdown 
director austin pendleton has given the play an austere and 
unsentimental production despite the overflowing of argument 
pendleton doesnt allow the drama to turn to mush 
but he does allow a massive turntable set of drab living rooms 
designed by andrew jackness to nearly overwhelm what should be an 
intimate drama the rooms swivel ominously between every scene 
in the end then spoils of war is not a perfect play just a 
small one but it certainly is intriguing chiefly because of the 
incandescent miss nelligan

here are the findings of some other new york critics 
in the new york times frank rich wrote that weller seemed on 
the verge of a major breakthrough with this work but it didnt 
quite deliver 
he said it is wellers most absorbing play always intelligent 
and at times moving but it is still too lumpy both in the writing 
and in austin pendletons erratic direction to achieve the lofty 
theatrical stature promised by its characters and ideas 
but the times called the plan compulsively watchable whenever 
ms nelligan is on stage 
in the daily news howard kissel wrote that the story is less 
convincing because its principal combatants are all essentially 
selfish cold people 
it is hard to know why the son wants to bring his parents 
together since his father left before he was old enough to remember 
them as a couple 
in the new york post clive barnes called the play emotionally 
charged and moving 
he said he suspects the play is still not the one weller would 
have liked to have written 
but while he concluded it is not the glass menagerie or even 
an animal in such a zoo it remains a touchingly lovely work 
touchingly performed

aide to repay 77 million to ptl for taking undeserved profits from 
the tv ministry 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds said he determined that the 
bakkers and former ptl vice president david taggart were overpaid 
during their last four years at the ministry 
in conforming with the religious overture of this case this 
court observes that james bakker either overlooked or ignored parts 
of the bible including 1 timothy 610 for the love of money is 
the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have 
erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many 
sorrows reynolds said in his order filed thursday 
reynolds said galatians 67 should also be applied to the ptl 
case be not deceived god is not mocked for whatever a man 
soweth that shall he also reap 
ptl now under administration of the bankruptcy court sued the 
bakkers and taggart on feb 1 for 52 million the ministry alleged 
they grossly mismanaged the ministry by taking huge sums for 
personal use between 1984 and 1987 while ptl couldnt pay its bills 
during the trial which ended oct 20 ptl dropped its claim to 
all but 77 million reynoldss judgment is the first time any 
court has ruled that bakker or other ptl leaders used ptl donors 
money improperly 
in the order reynolds said jim bakker who founded ptl and left 
in march 1987 after admitting to a tryst with former church 
secretary jessica hahn must pay ptl 49 million tammy bakker his 
wife and former cohost of the ptl club television show must 
repay 677397 and taggart must repay 1 million 
in addition reynolds ordered bakker and taggart jointly must 
repay ptl another 1 million taggart was fired in april 1987 by 
jerry falwell who took over ptl from bakker 
ptl attorney r bradford leggett of winstonsalem nc said 
i think the judges opinion made a clear suggestion that when 
people contribute to support a ministry there is a trust involved 
that must be dealt with in good faith 
reynolds in his 50page order said ptls expenditures under 
bakker were unbelievable and a waste of ptls money he also 
accused the administrators of gross mismanagement and total 
disregard for reality 
reynolds said it appeared the ptl board of directors was never 
informed that the ministry and christian theme park near fort mill 
was in any kind of precarious financial position 
the judge rejected bakkers attempts during the trial to justify 
the 66 million in salary and bonuses he and his wife collected 
between 1984 and 1987 
we plan to appeal said ryan hovis the bakkers rock hill 
attorney hovis said bakker could not repay the ministry because 
he doesnt have anything 
a secretary at the bakkers new organization jim and tammy 
ministries in pineville nc said bakker would not comment until 
he reads the order 
taggarts attorney ben cotten of washington dc did not 
return telephone calls seeking comment 
last month bakker and several former ptl associates were 
notified they are targets of an investigation by a federal grand 
jury in charlotte nc which focuses on possible mail and wire 
fraud conspiracy and criminal tax violations 
leggett said that although the bakkers and taggart have the right 
to appeal reynolds judgment to us district court ptl intends to 
begin trying to collect from them 
reynolds is scheduled to choose a buyer for ptls assets on 
wednesday from four bids ranging from 113 million to 120 million

a nationally recognized drug therapy researcher 
was sentenced to 60 days in a halfway house for submitting false 
data to the national institute of mental health on treatment of 
mentally retarded children 
the researcher stephen e breuning is believed to be the first 
scientist prosecuted by the federal government for faking medical 
research 
us district judge frank a kaufman on thursday also sentenced 
breuning 36 to five years of probation and ordered him to pay 
back 11352 in salary serve 250 hours of community service and 
abstain from psychological research for at least the period of his 
probation breuning agreed to stay out of the field at least 10 
years as requested by prosecutors 
its quite obvious that our society cannot tolerate this type 
of fraud the judge told breuning a former university of 
pittsburgh psychologist fraud eats at the very guts of society 
kaufman ordered breuning to serve his sentence in a halfway house 
near his home in rochester mich where he recently opened a store 
selling compact discs and stereo equipment 
breuning pleaded guilty sept 19 to two counts of making false 
statements on grant applications in exchange for the dropping of a 
charge that he obstructed an investigation at bethesdabased nimh 
into the authenticity of his data 
youve paid very very dearly for what youve done you will 
continue to pay dearly the judge said 
prosecutors said that not only was breunings career ruined but 
he had hurt research assistants who had rested their careers on 
his work 
the judge called breunings actions the kind of aberration of 
conduct that could occur among other researchers in the highly 
charged competitive atmosphere of academia 
a remorseful breuning told the judge that his guilt was 
something im very embarrassed and ashamed about 
the case sparked a tightening of standards for monitoring 
academic research as well as calls for legislation targeting 
scientists who fake their data 
according to prosecutors and a statement of facts in the case 
breunings research involved several nimhsponsored studies from 
1980 to 1984 at the university of pittsburgh to examine the use of 
drugs in controlling hyperactive retarded children 
the studies purportedly showed that children could be treated 
with smaller doses of tranquilizers as well as with stimulants such 
as ritalin and dexedrine which had fewer side effects than 
tranquilizers 
in a sentencing memorandum e thomas roberts an assistant us 
attorney said breuning seized on the opportunity to prove the 
popular theory that less immediate intervention with drugs 
coupled with other treatment techniques could be more beneficial to 
the children 
but in his eagerness breuning used false data and research 
results from other studies said roberts and breunings attorney 
charles s lazar 
there was no evidence supporting most of the research by dr 
breuning the sentencing memorandum said and much of the research 
by his assistants was producing contradictory information to that 
which dr breuning was officially reporting 
prosecutors said only 25 of 278 children in the studies actually 
received the drugs 
the grants breuning obtained provided significant financial 
support for the universitys psychiatric clinic roberts said in 
court papers 
lazar said in documents that his client who sought 200000 in 
grants from nimh falsified the data because he felt pressured by 
the publishorperish atmosphere of academic research he said 
breuning intended to combine previous research with work done at the 
university of pittsburgh but instead produced a study that was 
careless and misleading 
however prosecutors and lazar noted breuning received no 
personal financial benefit from the grants no children were harmed 
by treatment based on his research and the university of pittsburgh 
repayed 162000 in grants to nimh

towns on the island of palawan killing 75 people and raising to at 
least 670 the number feared dead from three typhoons that struck the 
country in two weeks officials said today 
the philippine red cross said about 600 people were missing on 
palawan alone after widespread flooding and landslides caused by 
heavy rain generated by tess the second of three storms to hit the

the palawan provincial capital of puerto princesa 370 miles 
southwest of manila 
he said in many places along the islands northsouth coastal 
road the water rose up to seven feet

yesterday that the reports of the deaths started coming he said 
we have not heard from the calamian group a cluster of islands 
north of palawan that is part of the province 
palawan 270 miles long is known as the philippines last 
frontier because of its ruggedness and with the exception of the 
provincial capital its isolation from the rest of the country

swelling troops of deer hunters in east 
texas including rambo types in military dress armed with 
semiautomatic weapons are outmanning and outgunning us forest 
service agents on public lands officials say 
its scary as hell billy ball special agent for the forest 
service said thursday these guys are carrying cannons and were 
regulated by policy with sixshooting pop pistols 
last year texas moved past pennsylvania to become the state 
issuing the most hunting licenses but as the ranks of hunters have 
grown and become unruly a situation aggravated by alcohol and drug 
use some private land owners have been restricting access to their 
property officials say 
all of which has put increased pressure on east texas four 
national forests sabine davy crockett angelina and sam houston 
during the firearms deer season that began last weekend 
i wouldnt go out there myself nor take my family said carl 
gidlund a us forest service public information officer its 
turning into an arsenal out there 
whats changed on the forest is that were seeing a lot of 
military weapons or semiautomatic weapons instead of rifles 
ball said 
we seeing people moving away from the traditional weapons to a 
military look dress weapons we call it the rambo syndrome they 
get their faces painted up and theyre wildlooking 
in the deer seasons first weekend law enforcement officers 
received death threats from hunters a 14yearold boy was wounded 
by a hunter firing at a wounded deer and another hunter was found 
unconscious after falling 30 feet from an illegal deer blind or a 
platform devised to hide hunters from deer 
officers also were investigating illegal blockades set up by some 
hunters to keep others off public land and incidents in which nails 
were spread over some federal forest roads 
we presume its people trying to keep other people out of their 
exclusive hunting areas gidlund said one witness said he 
picked up 20 pounds of nails 
on wednesday night three hunters told authorities they were 
ordered at gunpoint from national forest land by other hunters 
its locals who say my daddy and my granddaddy hunted here and 
you city slickers arent hunting here ball said and we have 
to referee these things 
im not classifying all hunters like this but you got a crowd 
of people getting together with adrenalin pumping and some alcohol 
and drug use and youre going to have trouble 
ball is one of seven federal law enforcement officers patrolling 
700000 acres in 15 counties the agents are equipped with sixshot 
357caliber magnum pistols 
officials say the sam houston national forest about 50 miles 
north of houston has the most hunting pressure followed by the 
davy crockett about another 50 miles farther north 
rich glodowski district law officer for the sam houston forest 
said he wears a bulletproof vest to protect himself while on patrol 
but with the firepower out there theres no way its going to 
stop it he said im not sure what the answer is 
in addition to semiautomatics officials are finding greater use 
of handguns 
theyve got two or more handguns and bandoleers ammunition 
belts with 90 rounds you can kill all the damn deer in east texas 
with those ball said 
although no statistics were available on the number of hunters in 
the forests all of the forest service campgrounds for hunters are 
filled gidlund said 
jerry mccrae of the texas parks and wildlife department regional 
office in rusk said some private land owners are charging hunters 
400 per gun to hunt and many wont tolerate rambo types on 
their land 
the national forest is a natural attraction for those 
individuals mccrae said it is open and the fact it is free it 
does attract a crowd

two flash fires and a powerful explosion 
ripped through a printing plant knocking firefighters right out 
of the building and onto the pavement and injuring at least 20 
people officials said 
the plant and the adjacent building housing the courierjournal 
kentuckys largest newspaper were evacuated from the scene thursday 
night and a large downtown block was sealed off by police 
the fires and explosion at standard gravure corp were fueled by 
ink and naphtha a volatile chemical used to thin printing ink that 
was believed responsible for the explosion officials said two 
pressman and 18 firefighters were hurt said fire capt keith 
milliner 
the courierjournal meanwhile relied on an emergency agreement 
with the competing lexington heraldleader 80 miles away to print 
todays paper 
the newspapers staff went back to the oldfashioned way 
said george gill president and publisher staffers worked with 
typewriters and telephones set up in an old companyowned building 
across the street 
an eightpage edition without ads was planned 
it wont be much of a newspaper but it will be a newspaper 
gill said noting that the courierjournal had never missed a day of 
publication 
art smithers night supervisor at the plant which prints 
magazines and color advertising materials said the first fire broke 
out about 6 pm in one of the presses injuring two pressmen the 
blaze apparently was started by static electricity said capt 
dennis kangas of the citys arson squad 
a chemical fire extinguisher that came on automatically put out 
the blaze said pressman walter emert 
but the fire tore open the presss ink fountain which holds 30 
to 40 gallons said standard gravure vice president jack uhl 
workers were cleaning up from the first fire when the second 
flared apparently ignited by embers contacting newsprint and ink 
that had spilled on the floor smithers said the fire spread to a 
subbasement lacking an automatic fire extinguisher 
firefighters who entered the building with chemicals and hoses to 
put out the inkrelated fire were unaware that the highly volatile 
chemical vapors from the ink were filling the building and fueling 
the flames said milliner 
he said the force of the blast about 725 pm lifted 
firefighters off their feet knocking some into walls and through 
doors into a parking lot 
the explosion left a gaping twostory hole in the rear wall of 
the sixstory building 
sgt john hall said he was helping lay a line when about 10 
firefighters were blown right out of the building and onto the 
pavement here 
injured firefighters staggered from the building coughing and 
gasping and some appeared dazed about 65 firefighters had been 
called to battle the blazes 
at least eight of the injured firefighters were admitted to 
humana hospitaluniversity of louisville with first and 
seconddegree burns head injuries and lung irritations said dr 
frank lavoie an emergency room physician 
seven others were treated and released at the hospital for first 
and seconddegree flash burns on their faces and hands and smoke 
inhalation said spokeswoman taylor rice 
the two injured pressmen were taken to methodist evangelical 
hospital for treatment of burns on their arms and faces a hospital 
spokeswoman said they were in stable condition

or more of the 10 million presses would have to be substantially 
rebuilt

when olive may wilburn 81 learned that 
the superconducting super collider was coming she wept for the home 
her family stands to lose along with the land her late husband 
began farming in 1944

44 billion atom smasher which 20 states had bid for in ellis 
county just south of dallas 
the project promises to bring a bonanza of jobs better schools 
and other benefits to the area for mrs wilburn it promises to 
take away the 200acre farm her husband worked until his death 10 
years ago and where her 3yearold greatgranddaughter pamela 
hopgood now plays 
plans call for the wilburn homestead to become the research 
campus for the super collider about midway between waxahachie and 
maypearl the farm is about five miles northeast of maypearl 
only wednesday the wheat field around mrs wilburns house was 
plowed now she doesnt know what to do 
i just kept thinking that maybe it wouldnt come maybe it 
wouldnt happen she said 
after texas bid for the super collider state and federal 
officials notified the wilburns their acreage would be needed if the 
state won 
mrs wilburns granddaughter betty hopgood heard the news on 
the radio thursday morning and told her grandmother

i cried but not too long said mrs wilburn who with her 
husband worked 20 years to pay off the mortgage it dont do no 
good anymore ive got to get out and i dont know where im going

kitchen doubted they will be able to buy enough adjacent land for 
the family to live as close to each other as they have 
well never be together again pretty soon mrs hopgood

three politburo members flew to the three baltic 
republics today to deal with growing complaints that proposed soviet 
constitutional reforms will crush current moves toward economic and 
cultural independence from moscow 
politburo member viktor chebrikov traveled to estonia vadim 
medvedev to latvia and nikolai slyunkov to lithuania their visits 
were reported by stateowned media in the baltics but not by the 
national media in moscow 
the visits come a day after the politburo the top communist 
party leadership decided to consider changing draft constitutional 
amendments in response to thousands of suggestions the official 
newspaper pravda reported today for the first time 
popular front movements local governments and communist party 
organizations in the three republics have denounced reform measures 
at issue are provisions that would eliminate the right of republics 
to secede from the soviet union and shift power from the 14 
nonrussian republics to moscow 
the popular front in vilnius the lithuanian restructuring 
movement meets sunday to consider the issue and the lithuanian 
supreme soviet will meet thursday the estonian supreme soviet or 
legislature is to meet wednesday 
members of the three popular fronts are gathering signatures on 
petitions asking the amendments be dropped and rewritten from 
scratch said algimontas vaishnoras of the lithuanian restructuring 
movement 
the pravda article also promised future discussion of questions 
of the status of unions and autonomous republics to expand the 
rights and possibilities in various spheres of economic 
socialpolitical and cultural life 
it said the 300member central committee of the communist party 
plans a special meeting on the subject but the newspaper gave no 
date 
the presidium elected by the supreme soviet or parliament has 
received more than 80000 letters on the proposed amendments pravda 
reported 
most are favorable it said but many suggest changes being 
reviewed by a special commission of the supreme soviet 
no argument will go without attention it promised however 
it said the leadership planned to tackle many of the issues in later 
constitutional reform 
the baltic republics are not the only ones with serious 
complaints human rights activist andrei sakharov has publicly 
argued that the reform concentrates too much power in a strong 
presidency risking a repeat of the disastrous rule of dictator 
josef stalin 
sakharov also seeks a strong guarantee of free speech in the 
constitutinoal reform

in a stinging ruling the state supreme 
court said parents have no right to make martyrs of their 
children by placing their physical health entirely in the hands of 
faith healers 
the court thursday allowed the involuntary manslaughter 
prosecution of laurie walker of sacramento a christian scientist 
whose 4yearold daughter died of meningitis in march 1984 17 days 
after being taken to a faith healer 
the court rejected arguments that a parent cannot be prosecuted 
for choosing prayer rather than conventional medical treatment for a 
child when the choice is made in accordance with church beliefs 
mrs walkers lawyer thomas volk said he would appeal to the 
us supreme court if the state court refuses to reconsider its 
decision 
spiritual healing is an indispensible part of christian science 
religion volk said allowing the prosecution of a sincerely 
believing church member for resorting to spiritual healing 
threatens the very heart of christian science he said 
volk had argued that parents would be protected from prosecution 
by state law and constitutional freedom of religion 
deputy attorney general clifford thompson declined to comment on 
the case 
the church which claims at least 350000 members worldwide 
doesnt forbid its members to go to doctors but they are supposed to 
refrain from conventional medical treatment at the same time they 
are seeking spiritual healing volk said 
thursdays decision affects pending prosecutions in sonoma and 
los angeles counties against christian science parents whose 
children also died of meningitis while under spiritual care 
in each case the charges were based on allegations that the 
failure to seek conventional treatment amounted to criminal 
negligence causing the childrens death 
mrs walker called a christian science practitioner after her 
daughter shauntay showed flu symptoms in february 1984 the 
practitioner and a christian science nurse attended and prayed for 
the girl but she died 17 days later she received no conventional 
medical treatment 
in thursdays opinion justice stanley mosk quoted a 1944 us 
supreme court ruling that denied a religious exemption from child 
labor laws 
parents may be free to become martyrs themselves that ruling 
said but it does not follow they are free in identical 
circumstances to make martyrs of their children 
upholding lower court decisions the california court said 
christian science churchsponsored state laws passed in 1925 and 
1976 recognized the right to seek spiritual healing in some 
circumstances but did not provide a shield against criminal charges 
when a child is threatened with serious harm 
volk mrs walkers lawyer contended the state could enforce 
laws that allow courts and social workers to intervene on behalf of 
endangered children and not prosecute but mosk said those 
procedures would work only if the government learned of a childs 
interest in time to take action

hirohito has not discharged blood or received any transfusions 
the past two days but court doctors remain on alert because 
internal hemorrhaging could occur any time palace spokesman kenji

our leading hypothesis is that it reflects selfdeferral among 
highrisk applicants people who know they have aids virus 
infections or suspect they might be at increased risk are not 
coming into the recruitment centers said dr marta gwinn an aids 
specialist with the atlantabased cdc 
that theory is based in part on the fact that while there has 
been a statistically significant decrease in aids infection 
among male recruits infection rates among female recruits who may 
be less likely to think they are infected have stayed largely 
constant the cdc said in its weekly report 
the rate of aids infection among male recruits has dropped from 
17 per 10000 in initial testing to 12 in the latest numbers while 
the rate for female recruits has risen from seven per 10000 to 
eight 
women may be less aware of their risk for infection the 
cdc said only 9 percent of all us aids cases have occurred in 
women homosexual or bisexual men account for 68 percent 
although aids infection rates are lower among military recruits 
than the public largely because gay men and drug users are subject 
to exclusion from military service the military test results are 
still of interest to researchers ms gwinn said 
if the incidence of infection were to decline we might detect 
it first in the youngest age groups she said noting that 
military recruits tend to be in their late teens or early 20s 
were we to see a dramatic decline in the youngest age group it 
would be potentially encouraging she added that is not what is 
happening at the present time though 
the military has tested more than 15 million recruits for aids 
infection more than 2100 or 014 percent have tested positive 
federal health officials estimate that about 06 percent of the us 
population is infected with the aids virus

six koreans from the communist north 
and prowestern south have sought political asylum in the united 
states in the past two years a leading south korean newspaper said 
today 
the joongang daily news quoting government sources it did not 
identify said the us government still is reviewing the cases and 
none of them has been granted asylum yet 
it said four of the defectors were from the south and two from 
the north 
the sources obtained their information through the us embassy 
in seoul the paper said no independent confirmation of the report 
was possible because the embassy was closed to observe veterans day 
joongang said the us state department confirmed that the six 
sought asylum between october 1986 and september this year but 
refused to identify them for security reasons 
in seoul there was speculation that the south korean defectors 
may include prominent people who worked with former president chun 
doohwan a parliamentary committee currently is investigating chun 
for alleged corruption and other misdeeds during his sevenyear term

a rare indian rhinoceros apparently died of 
shock after getting its head stuck in an 18inch opening in a zoo 
gate officials said 
the 2ton animal which had lived at the los angeles zoo for 19 
years had reared up and put its head through the opening locking 
its horn said zoo director warren thomas 
youre dealing with an animal with a relatively limited 
intelligence level and she panicked it never occurred to her to 
turn her head slightly sideways to slip her head out thomas said 
thursday 
the animal named rhada was found dead thursday morning it 
apparently became trapped overnight the rhinos air passages 
remained open indicating the animal died of shock and not 
suffocation said thomas 
the zoo has nighttime care for sick animals but no routine checks 
for healthy ones you dont want to disturb them thomas said 
you dont want to spook them 
the 21yearold rhino born in india was one of 75 in zoos 
worldwide and one of few to breed successfully in captivity about 
2000 of the endangered species live in the wild rhinos live to 
about 40 thomas said 
it is a tragedy for us and a tragedy for the species because 
she is one of the few successful breeders and her genes are real 
valuable in a species survival program said zoo spokeswoman lora 
la marca 
rhada had given birth to two calves including a 2yearold male 
that was with her in her pen when she became trapped thomas said

the president today issued an emergency 
decree saying that anyone convicted of instigating strikes will be 
hanged 
the presidents office also said that anyone found guilty of 
possessing leaflets or posters calling for strikes will be 
imprisoned or hanged 
the government of president junius r jayewardene issued copies 
of the decree after shops and businesses reopened following a 
fourday strike called by sinhalese extremists demanding 
jayewardenes resignation 
on thursday soldiers killed 18 antigovernment demonstrators who 
defied curfews and marched through three sinhalese towns the 
confrontation came one day after the army was ordered to shoot on 
sight anyone staging demonstrations 
the decree was issued under the state of emergency in effect 
since 1983 when ethnic tensions in this onceplacid island nation 
set off a chain of massacres assassinations and guerrilla attacks 
the presidential announcement said the new regulations would be 
strictly enforced in the interests of the welfare of the people of 
this country 
the army was ordered to arrest anyone carrying strike leaflets or 
posters or displaying them inside or outside their homes according 
to the announcement by jayewardenes office anyone found in 
possession of such items was to be taken before a military tribunal 
for immediate trial and conviction could result in prison terms or 
death by hanging 
the decree also provides capital punishment for anyone convicted 
of using persuasion or intimidation to keep people away from jobs 
declared essential under emergency laws these jobs include those in 
public transport and distribution of food and fuel 
aroundtheclock curfews were extended until 8 am saturday in 
predominantly sinhalese southern and central sri lanka 
the peoples liberation front composed of sinhalese extremists 
has vowed to keep calling strikes until jayewardene himself a 
sinhalese dissolves parliament and resigns clearing the way for a 
caretaker government representing all political parties to oversee 
the dec 19 presidential elections the strikes are usually 
announced by leaflets or by posters that appear on walls overnight 
jayewardene barred by the constitution from seeking a third 
term is not running for reelection but the front claims his 
government is incapable of conducting a fair election 
the front opposes jayewardenes peace overtures to tamil 
guerrillas fighting for a separate homeland in northern and eastern 
sri lanka more than 8500 people mostly sinhalese civilians have 
been killed since tamil guerrillas launched their separatist war in 
1983 
tamils who make up 18 percent of the countrys population of 16 
million claim the sinhalese majority discriminates against them in 
jobs and education sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population hold most top government and military jobs 
fifteen months ago under a peace plan brokered by india the sri 
lankan government offered a measure of autonomy to tamils if their 
fighters laid down their arms the bestarmed tamil militants 
rejected the offer and are now fighting indian peacekeeping troops 
sent to disarm them 
the peace plan spurred a sinhalese backlash against the 
government the peoples liberation front vowed to kill anyone who 
supported the proposal 
since then more than 550 government officials and supporters 
have been assassinated and authorities blame the killings on the 
front

if theres one theme behind californians 
pummeling auto insurers and michiganders striking a blow at 
abortion its that many voters are growing fed up with legislatures 
and are ready to take lawmaking into their own hands 
so say experts on the initiative process as they survey the 
results of the 229 statewide issues and hundreds of local questions 
that citizens confronted on election day 
its definitely an expression of impatience with the regular 
political process says david schmidt editor of the newsletter 
initiative and referendum the power of the people published in 
san francisco the city where voters on tuesday waded through no 
less than 29 statewide initiatives and 24 local issues 
of the 229 statewide issues a record 54 were citizen 
initiatives topping the previous high of 52 in 1982 according to 
pat mcguigan an authority on ballot issues at the washingtonbased 
institute for government and politics 
citizen initiatives find their way onto ballots mainly because 
enough people believe they have a problem that they feel legislators 
arent doing much about soaring auto premiums in california for 
example 
but thats not the entire explanation said mcguigan 
there are certainly elements of public disgust but what youre 
seeing now is that wellfunded interest groups see this initiative 
process as a good way to promote their agendas he said 
such populist lawmaking is possible only in the 26 states plus 
the district of columbia where citizen initiatives are allowed 
those states are mostly in the west and midwest and the number 
hasnt changed significantly in years 
some of this years upsurge in initiative activity is simply the 
normal pattern of having many more initiatives in evennumbered 
years when voter turnout is heaviest in 1981 1983 1985 and 1987 
there were six five four and five citizen initiatives on state 
ballots respectively but in 1982 1984 1986 and 1988 there were 
52 40 42 and 54 
in the past environmental activists have forced states to enact 
bottle bills the early 1980s saw scores of nuclear freeze 
initiatives tax rebels have forced states to curb spending 
starting with california a decade ago 
state legislative spokesmen dont deny the publics frustration 
with their workings but william pound executive director of the 
national conference of state legislatures said that increasingly it 
is special interests who are turning to the initiative process after 
failing to get their way in the statehouse 
even so the failure of big money to sway voters in so many 
ballot contests this year was extraordinary 
on tuesday prolife groups forced an end to state funding of 
abortions in michigan arkansas and colorado but trial lawyers 
spent 15 million in a losing effort to promote an auto insurance 
reform measure in california in florida doctors lost an expensive 
battle to limit liability claims for bodily injury to 100000 for 
noneconomic losses such as pain and suffering 
tobacco companies spent some 15 million opposing a 25cent hike 
in californias cigarette tax and lost 
the national rifle association spent upwards of 4 million to get 
maryland voters to repeal its new law banning cheap handguns and 
lost also 
californias auto insurance battle was the bitterest and most 
expensive of all 
people had a real financial incentive in this said schmidt 
the legislature couldnt or wouldnt do anything about rising 
auto premiums trial lawyers fought the insurance lobby to a 
standoff 
the result was that californians decided to tackle the issue 
themselves they chose among five ballot measures some backed by 
the legal community some by the auto insurers and one by consumer 
advocate ralph nader 
as with gun control in maryland and tort reform in florida the 
side with the least money won the most votes the naderbacked issue 
cutting auto rates by at least 20 percent defeated rival measures 
that insurers and trial lawyers had spent 75 million unsuccessfully 
promoting 
usually nothing has talked louder or more successfully in the 
initiative process than money says thomas e cronin a political 
scientist at colorado college who is finishing a book on the 
initiative process 
money plays an important role in almost all aspects of direct 
democracy devices cronin wrote recently money may not always 
be a decisive factor yet money especially large amounts of money 
well spent can usually defeat ballot questions 
that citizen action triumphed in 1988 over money in several cases 
hasnt erased other concerns some have raised about the growth of 
the initiative process 
some fear initiatives are a vehicle for majorities to tyrannize 
minorities homosexuals arent the nations most popular group and 
sure enough a gay rights measure lost in oregon on tuesday 
but that happens in legislatures too said schmidt i just 
dont buy the argument that voters are so much more emotional or 
antiminority than legislators

a south african delegation met with us and soviet 
officials today hoping that agreement could be reached on a 
timetable for a cuban troop withdrawal from angola and for granting 
independence to southwest africa 
another meeting of officials from south africa cuba angola and 
the united states which is mediating the talks was planned a south 
african spokesman said the spokesman roland darrol said the south 
african delegation came to geneva in a positive frame of mind 
he said the head of the south african delegation neil van 
heerden directorgeneral of the department of foreign affairs met 
with us assistant secretary of state chester crocker today the 
south africans also met with a soviet observer delegation he said 
the sides are trying to achieve agreement on a withdrawal of an 
estimated 50000 cuban troops from angola where they are backing 
the marxist government south africa links independence for 
southwest africa to the troop withdrawal 
southwest africa also known as namibia is controlled by south 
africa in violation of a un resolution for independence there 
the soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin said 
thursday the only remaining issue at the talks is the timing of a 
cuban troop withdrawal 
a us proposal made in early october reportedly calls on cuba to 
withdraw half of its troops from angola by aug 1 with the 
remaining troops to be stationed in northern angola and withdrawn in 
stages by the end of 1990 
cuba reportedly wants a 30month timetable compared to the 24 
months sought by the united states and south africa 
a us proposal last month reportedly suggested jan 1 as a 
target date for independence in southwest africa with elections 
scheduled aug 1 
adamishin speaking through an interpreter thursday night 
expressed cautious optimism that agreement on a troop withdrawal 
could be reached during the geneva session which is scheduled to 
end sunday

attendance in october increased by almost 50000 people or more 
than 39 percent compared to the same month last year the park said

compared to a total of 125597 which had been the previous record 
for october in the last 10 years an average of 100500 people 
visited the park in the tenth month 
park officials attribute the significant increase in october 
visitation to warm weather and the many visitors wishing to view the 
park after the fires the release said 
the october figures bring the number of people to visit the park 
during its summer season may 1 to oct 31 to almost 207 million 
a 1605 percent decline from 1987 the summer attendance record 
247 million was set in 1978 
the 1988 summer attendance represented only a 5 percent decline 
from the 10year average of almost 217 million said robert barbee

the army imposed curfews and travel restrictions 
in the occupied lands today and deployed soldiers in jerusalems old 
walled city to prevent violence linked to the expected proclamation 
of a palestinian state 
troops rounded up hundreds of palestinians in anticipation of 
antiisraeli demonstrations during the fourday session of the 
palestine national council the parliamentinexile of the plo 
the council is expected to declare an independent palestinian 
state during its meeting which begins saturday in algiers 
palestinians were not allowed to enter jerusalem from the west 
bank and could move only within their own districts 
hundreds of soldiers in combat gear and armed with assault rifles 
were deployed in the old city which has a large arab population 
dozens of border police many carrying automatic weapons fitted with 
grenade launchers patrolled the streets 
troops put up three checkpoints on the bethlehemjerusalem 
highway turning away jerusalembound cars with blue west bank 
license plates arab witnesses said 
in an unusual move troops also questioned drivers of 
yellowplated israeli cars and in one instance ordered an arab 
laborer riding in a car with his israeli employer to stay behind 
border police patrolled the narrow alleys of bethlehem and two 
army jeeps escorted each israeli bus passing through the biblical 
city 
in the west bank city of ramallah troops at checkpoints turned 
back many residents and soldiers on foot checked id cards graffiti 
sprayed on walls read yes to the pnc and yes to the 
independent state

proposing peace talks 
we announce clearly no to a zionist state in the land of

a longterm study of women with silicone breast 
implants shows no support for newly expressed concerns about a 
cancer risk and 25 years of experience also shows the implants are 
safe plastic surgeons say 
we certainly wouldnt do it implant surgery if we thought 
there was a significant risk said george reading president of 
the american society of plastic and reconstructive surgeons 
an estimated 2 million women have received silicone implants 
with 130000 procedures done every year most are for cosmetic 
purposes and the rest for reconstruction after breast surgery 
the public citizen health research group a private health 
advocacy organization called this week for a ban on silicone 
implants which they said may give a risk of cancer and other health 
problems 
the group contacted the food and drug administration which had 
already scheduled a review of the devices an fda document said the 
agency has been increasingly concerned about reports of adverse 
effects from breast implants 
implants are small bags filled with clear silicone gel placed 
surgically behind breasts to make them appear larger the procedure 
can cost up to around 6000 reading said thursday 
the fda said it wants manufacturers of the implants to furnish 
scientific data to demonstrate the devices are safe and effective 
among other concerns it cited a study that showed the gel can 
produce tumors in laboratory rats although it is unlikely that 
this finding is relevant to humans the possibility of a cancer risk 
cannot be completely ruled out the fda said 
the type of tumor seen in the rats is common in rodents but not 
in humans said thomas krizek chairman of the surgery department at 
the pritzker school of medicine at the university of chicago 
krizek who has investigated effects of implants in rodents and 
reading said they have never heard of a woman with an implant 
getting that kind of tumor 
in addition no significantly higher rates for any kind of cancer 
have emerged from a study of about 3100 implant recipients in los 
angeles county said gary brody clinical professor of plastic 
surgery at the university of southern california 
the women have been followed for 12 years on average after their 
implants and up to 25 years he said 
fda also expressed concerns about fibrous tissue growing around 
the implants and causing painful hardening in the breast the 
possibility that gel will leak from the implant and possibly cause 
problems with the immune system or a fetus and the potential of 
implants to interfere with the use of xrays to spot early breast 
cancers 
fibrous tissue grows around an implant as a natural reaction by 
the body brody said probably less than 10 percent of implant 
recipients experience pain or other discomfort he said 
every woman is told its a risk before surgery he said 
sometimes the problem can be remedied without removing the implant 
but if that fails most women choose to leave the implant in he 
said 
gel has been found in lymph nodes but the idea of spread beyond 
that is only theoretical brody said there is no evidence of any 
effect on a fetus he said 
only isolated cases of immune system disturbance have been 
proposed as linked to implants and the evidence is not very 
convincing he said 
as for interfering with breast xrays robert mclelland chairman 
of the american college of radiologys committee on breast imaging 
said implants make for a very difficult exam because they can 
hide breast tissue 
implanted women who want a breast xray should ask if the 
radiologist is familiar with special techniques to remedy the 
problem he said 
if the radiologist says no or that no special techniques are 
required that would be reason to look elsewhere for the xray 
he said

the president of parliament resigned 
today under attack for saying on the 50th anniversary of the 
kristallnacht pogrom against the jews that many germans initially 
found hitlers rule glorious 
parliament president philipp jenningers speech also called the 
early years of the nazis third reich a triumphal procession 
in his resignation statement jenninger who also condemned the 
nazi pogram in his address thursday said he was misunderstood 
nevertheless his speech was criticized throughout the country 
and abroad 
this event shows us how the darkest chapter of german history 
is still a presentday thing hansjochen vogel leader of the 
opposition social democratic party said after jenningers 
resignation 
we must now work even harder with others to learn how to live 
and worthily deal with this challenge vogel told reporters 
the leftist greens party said in a statement the background of 
what happened is the inability of many germans to stand up to their 
own past we hope a discussion about guilt and responsibility 
for this recent history will take place 
the furor overshadowed west germanys carefully organized 
ceremonies marking kristallnacht the night of terror against the 
jews that signaled the start of the holocaust 
communist east germanys official news agency adn called the 
jenninger speech a scandal israels foreign ministry called the 
incident unacceptable and unfortunate 
its a scandal its a shame said frankfurt jewish community 
spokesman michel friedman a member of jennigers party the 
christian democrats 
jenniger said he was misunderstood my speech was not 
understood by many listeners the way i had intended it to be the 
56yearold politician said in a written statement announcing his 
resignation i am deeply sorry and i am very hurt if i have 
offended the feelings of others 
his speech at a special session of the bundestag or parliament 
caused a walkout by about 50 lawmakers and calls for his resignation 
he added during my whole political career most recently as 
president of the german parliament i have been active in working 
for reconciliation with the jews and for the vital interests of the 
state of israel 
jenninger said he was stepping down as bundestag president 
because he wanted to avoid damage to the office and because he 
believed he lost the trust of many colleagues 
jenninger had been the no 2 west german official after president 
richard von weizsaecker under the nations rules of diplomatic 
protocal 
a member of chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats 
jenninger has been a lawmaker since 1969 and was one of kohls 
closest aides before he was elected bundestag president in november 
1984 
in his speech thursday jenninger talked at length about the 
positive feelings of many ordinary germans early in the hitler 
dictatorship 
didnt hitler bring to reality what kaiser wilhelm ii had 
only promised that is to lead the germans to glorious times wasnt 
he chosen by providence a fuehrer such as is given to a people only 
once in a thousand years jenninger asked 
for the fate of the germans and european jews hitlers 
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and 
misdeeds jenninger said 
the years from 1933 to 1938 even from a distant retrospective 
and in the knowledge of what followed still are a fascinating thing 
today since throughout history there was hardly a parallel to 
hitlers triumphant procession during the first years 
some listeners sobbed when jenninger read an eyewitness account 
of the murder of concentration camp victims in 1942 
blood was running over the shoulders of almost everyone he 
read some of those shot were still moving some lifted their arms 
and turned their heads to show they were still alive 
social democratic chairman hansjochen vogel said in a letter to 
jenninger that the parliament president showed a disturbing lack 
of judgment 
world jewish congress president edgar m bronfman called 
jenningers remarks reprehensible 
but a leader of west germanys jewish community defended 
jenningers speech saying he could not understand calls for his 
resignation 
i welcome that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 said 
michael fuerst a deputy chairman of the central council of jews in 
west germany 
starting with the kristallnacht of nov 910 1938 the nazis 
made clear their intentions to wipe out european jews on that 
night nazi thugs destroyed jewish homes businesses and synagogues 
sending 30000 jews to concentration camps and killing 91 jews 
shattered glass covered the streets and the nazis mockingly 
named it kristallnacht or crystal night the nazis killed 6 million 
jews and many others during hitlers rule from 1933 to 1945

number reported homeless from an earlier quake on the southern 
border doubled to 200000 
the official china news service said several buildings were 
cracked and stairways collapsed in the guangxi zhuang region during 
thursdays quake which measured slightly more than 5 on the richter 
scale 
it occurred four days after a quake near the burmese border 
killed more than 930 people

people were were hurt nine seriously as they scrambled from 
buildings in the city of fangcheng the report said it said the 
trade city of canton also was shaken by the quake which was 
centered offshore in the beibu gulf 
seismologists said the quake may have been an aftershock of the 
sunday quake that devastated dozens of remote towns and farming 
villages in yunnan province west of guangxi zhuang that quake 
measured 76 on the richter scale 
more than 930 people were killed in that quake according to a 
preliminary count the official china news service quoted yunnan

financially troubled avtex inc the sole 
supplier of rayon yarn used in the space shuttle has a week to 
prove it can make a go of it or give the product rights to nasa 
under a 7 million rescue by the agency 
the money from nasa allowed avtex to recall 1300 workers 
thursday at its front royal plant which had closed a week earlier 
i dont look at it as a bailout because every time we give 
them something they give us something in return said jr 
thompson director of nasas marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala were not in the bailout business 
avtex based in valley forge pa is the sole supplier of the 
fiber used in rocket nozzles for the shuttle and an array of 
missiles nasa has said it has enough of the material on hand for 10 
more shuttle flights 
after nasa gives avtex the 7 million the company will have 
until nov 18 to demonstrate that it will generate enough other 
contracts to stay in business thompson said if avtex cannot do so 
nasa will take the rights to the fiber 
they transfer the rights to nasa as well as the cookbook to 
making this rayon fiber to our technical specifications thompson 
said 
if avtex convinces nasa it will stay alive nasa will sign an 11 
million contract for more fiber thompson said 
avtex in closing last week blamed a drop in business from the 
challenger disaster foreign competition for its other products and 
environmental regulations that have led to numerous pollution 
problems 
analysts who study the aerospace industry said that such 
dependence on one producer of a vital product is not unheard of 
during the summer nasa provided money to rocket maker morton 
thiokol inc which then loaned it to pacific engineering and 
production co for the rebuilding of a rocket fuel plant that blew 
up in nevada 
it is amazing said paul nisbet of prudential bache 
securities inc weve got lots of areas in the whole aerospace and 
military industries where there are a lot of potential problems if 
sources disappear from view 
we fight these fires one at a time thompson said

authorities threw a gala celebration today 
including a rare televised mass and a military parade in victory 
square to mark the 70th anniversary of the rebirth of the polish 
state 
in was the most elaborate celebration ever under communist 
authorities to mark the 1918 creation of the capitalist antisoviet 
republic in poland between the two world wars it also was the first 
time such lavish attention has been paid to polands leader between 
the wars marshal jozef pilsudski 
a roman catholic mass for the fatherland celebrated by the 
countrys chief military chaplain was televised 
legions of goosestepping soldiers marched in victory square 
the celebration sharply contrasted with treatment of the 
anniversary in the past private groups who tried to organize 
marches on the date every year after 1974 faced sharp repressions 
official attitudes toward the holiday have softened in the 
aftermath of the 1981 declaration of martial law with the 
government embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging national 
unity 
on nov 11 1918 a civil council in warsaw turned over military 
power to pilsudski who had just been released from a german prison 
at the end of world war i pilsudski proclaimed an independent 
polish state and disarmed the remaining german troops in the capital 
the reestablishment of poland after 123 years of being 
partitioned among prussia austria and russia fulfilled the dream of 
generations of patriots 
on the broad expanse of victory square communist party leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski wearing his army uniform and accompanied 
by prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski presided at the hourlong 
official ceremonies 
honor guards representing various branches and divisions of the 
military paid homage to the nation and ambassadors to poland laid 
wreathes at the unknown soldiers tomb which was guarded by 
soldiers in uniforms from different epochs of polish history 
we have fought long for recognizing the day of nov 11 as a 
national holiday said wojciech ziembinski an anticommunist 
historian who began organizing marches on the date in 1974 often 
spending months in jail for it 
today we can see the effects of our bloodless fight even those 
who exercise power in poland authorized by a foreign power had to 
accept the polish tradition he said in a telephone interview from 
his home 
on wednesday an independent member of the sejm or parliament 
moved that the government declare nov 11 an official state holiday 
as it was before world war ii however that seemed unlikely to 
happen acting labor minister jerzy szreter said thursday that an 
additional holiday would cost 167 million and noted that poland 
already has eight annual holidays

parliament president philipp jenninger 
whose remarks about germanys nazi past ended his 25year political 
career once said he became a public servant because of his fathers 
opposition to world war ii 
jenninger resigned today after he was sharply criticized over a 
speech he gave thursday in which he reminded his audience that 
hitlers rule was glorious in the view of many germans 
jenninger who also criticized the nazis made the speech during a 
ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht the night 
that began the holocaust 
chancellor helmut kohl also criticized his close friend and 
former aide over the tone of the speech the conservative die welt 
newspaper said 
in his resignation announcement jenninger said today that he has 
always been an opponent of every type of totalitarian rule and 
that he has been a consistent supporter of israel 
jenninger in a 1982 interview with west german reporters said 
he went into public service because his father told him the world 
must avoid another war like the one started by nazi germany in 1939 
two of my brothers died in the war my father told me when i 
was 12 be of service during your lifetime so that something like 
this can never again happen that influenced me jenninger said 
then 
jenninger a 56yearold member of kohls conservative christian 
democratic union rode to the highest position in the bundestag or 
parliament on a reputation for fairness and effectiveness 
as a close aide to kohl jenninger was a leading figure behind 
persuading east germany to let more of its people visit or move to 
west germany 
jenninger was also involved in preparations for a planned 1984 
visit to west germany of east german leader erich honecker but the 
soviet union vetoed the trip honecker did finally travel to west 
germany in 1987 the first east german leader ever to do so 
jenninger was born june 10 1932 in rindelbach in what is now 
badenwuerttenberg state 
he received his doctor of law degree in 1957 from the university 
of tuebingen 
jenninger began his political career in 1963 as an adviser in the 
defense ministry 
from 196669 jenninger worked as a political adviser to 
thenfinance minister franz josef strauss a powerful 
archconservative politician who died last month 
jenninger won a seat in the bundestag in 1969 and has been a 
member ever since 
he became the christian democratic unions chief parliamentary 
secretary in the bundestag in 1975 in charge of coordinating the 
partys parliamentary affairs 
when kohl became chancellor in october 1982 he awarded jenninger 
for his efforts by giving him the highpowered job of state minister 
in the chancellery 
jenninger became bundestag president on nov 5 1984 after 
rainer barzel quit the post in a corruption scandal 
the bundestag members elected jenninger president with 340 of 469 
votes reflecting the confidence his colleagues had in him 
the respected die zeit newspaper said at the time that kohl may 
have lost jenninger as his righthand man but that jenninger was an 
emergency victim for the sake of parliament

the european human rights commission 
said today it will review the case of a west german who is fighting 
extradition to the united states where he is wanted for a double 
slaying 
jens soering allegedly helped his us girlfriend kill her 
parents in 1985 in virginias bedford county 
the son of a west german diplomat soering lives in london where 
he is fighting extradition to the united states 
he has appealed to the european human rights commission arguing 
that if extradited he faces a possible death penalty in virginia 
neither britain nor west germany have capital punishment 
the european human rights commission is a body of the 21nation 
council of europe founded in 1949 the council is the oldest 
organization for european unity though its work has been eclipsed in 
recent decades by the european economic community or common market 
which is a separate organization 
a spokesman for the european human rights commissions office in 
london said the commission has agreed to review soerings case and 
to try to reach an settlement between soering and britain 
the human rights commissions office in strasbourg was closed for 
the armistice day public holiday 
if no amicable settlement can be reached the human rights 
commission will likely send soerings case to the european court of 
human rights for a ruling 
but that is unlikely to happen before next spring and the case 
may remain before the court for months if not years some cases 
have taken up to six years to come to a ruling

the local medical society has thrown 
its support behind 24 obstetricians accused of violating state and 
federal antitrust law by conspiring to boycott massachusetts blue 
shield 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon filed the suit 
against the doctors in federal court aug 31 seeking civil 
penalties of 30000 each 
the 700member hampden district medical society said the suit was 
the first of its kind in massachusetts blue shields rates are set 
by a quasipublic commission 
apparently a statesupported monopoly doesnt bother the 
attorney general but he feels that if any two physicians talk about 
anything in the corridors thats collusion said dr j gordon 
rich president of the medical society 
we feel there is no conspiracy and the first amendment rights 
of these doctors to free speech have been ignored and trod upon 
rich said we feel it is an effort to intimidate and browbeat this 
group of physicians and ultimately the entire profession 
rich said area doctors have privately established a fund drive 
for the legal defense of the doctors 
the attorney general accused the doctors of acting together to 
protest costcontainment efforts by blue shield which denies 
payment for procedures it considers unnecessary and refuses to 
compensate nonparticipating physicians 
the two dozen physicians or more than twothirds of the 
obstetricians in the city had notified the insurer in 1985 and 1986 
that they planned to resign blue shield requires a years notice 
and only two physicians actually left the program 
doctors who withdraw or threaten to withdraw from an insurance 
plan undermine coverage for others and cause higher insurance 
premiums shannon said 
but rich said to the best of my knowledge there was never any 
disruption of service to any blue shield patients 
an attorney for the doctors francis d dibble said the doctors 
made up their minds about blue shield independently and for a 
variety of reasons 
some said they felt blue shield was an arrogant and poorly run 
organization he said others said reimbursements were too low 
and others were pressured by rising malpractice insurance rates

vietnam veterans who were heavily exposed to 
the herbicide agent orange show clear physical effects with 
rashes fatty tumors and changes in skin color according to a study 
released today 
the study sponsored by the american legion said that combat 
veterans were also more likely to still be suffering from physical 
and psychological problems related to their war experiences 
based on interviews with 6810 american legion members from six 
states the study found that many vietnam veterans who took part in 
what was called high combat continue to suffer from post 
traumatic stress disorder 
left alone ptsd does not abate said american legion 
national commander hf gierke in a news release there are 
thousands of vietnam veterans who are living in america but they 
are not living the american dream 
the findings are in a fiveyear study conducted by steven d 
stellman of the new york city department of health and jeanne mager 
stellman of columbia university and published today in the 
scientific journal environmental research 
of the veterans interviewed for the study 42 percent or 2858 
served in southeast asia about 20 percent of this number were 
classified in the study as high combat which means they were 
involved frequently in active combat where people were being killed 
and their lives were in danger 
the study also found a correlation between high rates of exposure 
to the herbicide agent orange and some physical problems these 
findings contradict studies conducted by the military in which 
physical complaints by vietnam veterans were followed up with 
physical examinations at veterans administration h ospitals these 
federal studies found no correlation between agent orange exposure 
and ill health 
overall the american legion study said men who served in 
southeast asia had higher incidence of heart disease benign fatty 
tumors skin rash with blisters and an increased light senstivity in 
the eyes herbicide handlers the study said had a higher level of 
ulcers and high blood pressure and there was a correlation between 
skin ailments and the levels of agent orange exposure 
other findings reported in the study include 
veterans who experienced high combat were more apt to have 
high levels of depression anxiety and physical symptoms of 
depression than those who saw little combat or did not serve in 
southeast asia 
high combat veterans were more likely to be heavy smokers and 
drinkers and have a more difficult time reducing consumption high 
combat veterans were twice as likely to take tranquilizers or 
sleeping pills but illicit drug use was found to be very low 
the post traumatic stress disorder rate varied from 18 to 15 
percent depending on the level of combat and the symptoms for some 
of those interviewed have persisted for as long as 20 years

church of england leaders have voted to triple the 
number of blacks on their policymaking synod a move deplored as 
the reverse of apartheid by the conservative governments 
representative 
with little more than half its members present thursday the 
synod voted 21474 with 11 abstentions to have at least 24 black 
representatives on the 574member general synod the synod currently 
has eight black members 
black people in our midst have a great contribution to make 
said the most rev john habgood archbishop of york we need to 
increase their representation in the church as a whole 
he said the move would encourage blacks to run for election to 
the synod in their church parishes 
the vote followed a report from the churchs committee for black 
anglican concerns which proposed the change for the next synod 
elections in 1990 if 24 blacks are not elected in 1990 the minimum 
will be achieved by appointing unsuccessful black candidates with 
the highest number of votes 
paul rippon an english barrister called the proposal deeply 
insulting to black people because it suggests they cannot get into 
the synod on their merits 
but barbadosborn wilfred wood bishop of croydon and the 
churchs first black bishop to serve in england said after the 
vote im gratified i hope black people will come forward and 
take their places in the church of england he heads the committee 
for black anglican concerns 
there are no statistics on how many blacks are in the church of 
england which has about 1 million regular sunday worshipers 
woods committee estimates blacks account for about 7 percent of 
englands 49 million people it said the synods standing committee 
suggested it choose a figure we believe that not less than 24 is 
about right the report said 
john gummer the conservative local government minister and a 
leading synod member called it apartheid in reverse or reverse 
discrimination 
joan wakeling a deaconess agreed we are going to need a lot 
of work from the lawyers if we vote for discrimination on behalf of 
black people we could find ourselves setting an unhappy precedent 
gummer said the problem is that not enough blacks ran for the 
synod and the church should do more by asking blacks to be synod 
candidates 
before the debate synod officials who took legal advice on the 
proposal were told by barrister anthony lester that by giving 
special provision to blacks they probably would contravene the 1976 
race relations act designed to bring about racial equality for the 
countrys ethnic minorities 
lester advised that the synods attorneys could probably frame a 
measure to circumvent the act which would require parliamentary 
approval

surgeons at a hospital here implanted human fetal 
cells in a mans brain in hopes of easing symptoms of parkinsons 
disease an experimental procedure attempted previously in mexico 
and sweden doctors say 
the 52yearold denver man whose name was not released was in 
good condition today at the university of colorado health sciences 
center said missy crim a hospital spokeswoman 
a team headed by dr curt freed performed the eighthour 
operation wednesday the patient has suffered from parkinsons for 
20 years 
we dont expect our patient to improve for three to six 
months said freed doctors said they are unsure how much function 
will be restored 
parkinsons disease which affects an estimated 500000 people in 
the united states from degenerative loss of brain cells that 
produce a messagecarrying substance called dopamine 
freed said his experiments on monkeys indicate fetal tissue 
implanted in the brain can produce dopamine and possibly curtail 
parkinsons symptoms which include tremors slow movement rigidity 
in the limbs and stooped posture 
we expect general mobility would improve and hopefully a 
reduction in drug needs freed said in some marvelous world 
the patient would throw away his crutches but i think hed be happy 
if he could be where he was 10 years ago 
he said the fetal cells are exactly like seeds which could 
take up to six months to grow spread and reenergize the brain 
implants were done on a few parkinsons patients in mexico and 
sweden but freed said the results were far from satisfactory he 
said many us are primed to attempt the procedure but he 
believes he was the first 
the patients condition had deteriorated to the point where he 
took maximum doses of drugs for little benefit said dr neil 
rosenberg a neurologist the man was unable to work for several 
years and asked for the implant 
university neurosurgeon robert breeze who actually transplanted 
the cells wednesday said they were implanted with needles through a 
hole in the top of the skull to the area deep in the brain where 
dopamine acts 
the two miligrams of tissue implanted were obtained from an 
abortion performed by a physician who wasnt involved in the 
research the patient gave her consent the doctors said

climate remained chilly and that both sides still refuse to speak to 
each other

something that could be called conversation eliasson added 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati said the latest 
meetings featured a better climate and we do hope that the next 
round will achieve practical progress 
his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz also voiced hope for progress 
and said iraq will do its best to make the next round fruitful

uphold a ceasefire in effect since aug 20 and to implement un 
resolution 598 which calls for a comprehensive peace settlement in 
the 8yearold war 
he gave both sides credit for accepting a red cross proposal to 
begin exchanging disabled war prisoners nov 20

stuck on various points including the withdrawal of forces to 
internationally recognized borders iran insists that the withdrawal 
be based on a 1975 border treaty that iraq insists is invalid

communist authorities have resurrected the 
image of marshal jozef pilsudski the enigmatic revolutionary who 
restored polish statehood 70 years ago and deposed the government 
eight years later 
once consigned to stalinist oblivion pilsudski is now being 
honored by those same authorities who once scorned him as a 
reactionary dictator 
the government also mounted a gala celebration today marking the 
anniversary of the birth of the prewar republic a parliamentarian 
had asked that today nov 11 the main national holiday before 
world war ii be officially restored as a state holiday 
todays ceremonies in warsaw included a rare televised mass and a 
military parade in victory square it represented the most elaborate 
celebration ever under communist authorities to mark the 1918 
creation of the capitalist antisoviet republic in poland between 
the two world wars 
earlier this week krakow authorities named a street for 
pilsudski and a warsaw newspaper launched a drive to set up a museum 
for the marshal in the house he owned in sulejowek outside the 
capital 
the cult of pilsudski has never quite died out in poland go into 
the home of nearly every supporter of the banned solidarity trade 
union movement and you see on the wall next to the solidarity emblem 
and photographs of polishborn john paul ii the bushy moustache and 
fiery eyes of pilsudski 
in recent years the communist party stressing its role of 
guarantor of the nations existence has begun to embrace popular 
national symbols such as pilsudski but historically pilsudski is 
harder for communists to swallow 
although he started out as a socialist he abandoned most leftist 
trappings soon after taking power 
one of his mostquoted remarks was i rode the red streetcar of 
socialism but got off at the stop called independence 
pilsudskis orientation was antirussian he dreamed of creating 
a multinational central european state that would be large enough to 
resist both soviet and german hegemony 
one of his first acts was invading the ukraine capturing kiev 
polish forces eventually were forced to retreat by the red army 
which in turn seemed on the verge of crossing poland and spreading 
communism to germany in 1920 
but the poles brilliant counteraction in midaugust 1920 handed 
the red army a humiliating defeat still remembered in poland as the 
miracle on the vistula 
lenin sued for peace giving up large chunks of previously 
russian territory that remained in polands hands until the soviet 
union took it back at the start of world war ii pilsudski and 
white poland were deemed class enemies 
pilsudski is considered a hero because he united the country and 
defended its independence at the end of world war i 
poland had been erased from the map of europe but not from the 
minds of poles during the previous 123 years having been 
partitioned by prussia austria and russia world war i and the 
bolshevik revolution saw the collapse of all three partitioning 
powers allowing poland to regain independence 
at the start of world war i pilsudski had raised a polish army 
and put it in the service of austria against russia but he was 
imprisoned by austrias ally germany when he refused to put his 
legions under german command 
when german ranks collapsed in a general panic at the end of the 
war pilsudski was freed from the castle where he was held 
after arriving in warsaw on nov 10 1918 local citizens gave 
him the title of commander he ordered the disarmament of remaining 
german troops and declared the polish republic restored power was 
legally transferred to his government nov 11 from a regency council 
set up by the germans 
but his reputation lost some luster in 1926 when impatient with 
discord in the elected government he came out of retirement to 
stage a military coup in which 300 people were killed 
although nominally out of power he became polands 
behindthescenes dictator until 1935 when he died and was buried in 
krakows wawel castle alongside polish kings 
his senior officers calling themselves the sanitation 
regime continued to rule until german and soviet invasions in 1939 
again wiped poland off the map 
postwar poland saw a new social order dominated by communists 
supported by the soviet union institutions such as warsaw 
university which had borne the name of pilsudski were renamed 
nov 11 was treated as an ordinary work day 
but 40 years later the pendulum has swung back with pilsudski 
restored to the status of national hero

a federal judge has ordered the government 
to allow federal prison inmates to write newspaper articles for pay 
us district judge charles legge on thursday issued a 
preliminary injunction barring the government from enforcing 
seldomused rules against such activity and from retaliating against 
a inmate who wrote an article critical of a warden 
legge said the inmate whose transfer started the case dannie 
martin posed no threat to safety or order within the 
institution by his writing and was punished only for the content 
of his articles in the san francisco chronicle 
the judge stopped short of ruling on the legality of regulations 
against inmates writing articles under their bylines for pay or 
setting up businesses the injunction is binding until those issues 
are decided in a trial 
assistant us attorney sandra willis said the case was not a 
matter of censorship as the judge implied and argued the ban on 
bylined writing and pay for outside articles was justified by 
security considerations 
the money that mr martin was trying to earn caused him to look 
for and say things he might not otherwise have said such as 
interviewing other prisoners willis said you cant control an 
inmate who has his own money 
but legge said other prisoners had been allowed to earn money and 
that the actions against martin were based on the content of his 
writings 
martins lawyer jeffrey leon argued that denny mclain the 
former major league pitcher who served a federal prison term on drug 
charges was allowed to write bylined articles for pay 
leon added that the parole board had told martin his writing was 
improving his chances of an early release 
martin joined by the chronicle sued federal prison officials 
for allegedly transferring him in retaliation for his article 
critical the warden at lompoc prison 
the suit contends the regulations against inmate articles 
violated freedom of expression 
martin 48 began a 33year sentence for bank robbery in 1981 he 
started sending articles to the chronicle two years ago on his 
observations about life at lompoc 
in june he was placed in solitary confinement after the 
chronicle ran his article criticizing the warden martin was 
transferred twice in the next two weeks 
the chronicle asked legge to return martin from a prison near 
phoenix to california where his observations would be of more value 
to its readers the judge asked the lawyers to consult on the issue

forest fires this summer 
and fall in yellowstone national park killed 254 large animals a 
small fraction of the population officials said 
of the 254 large animals determined to have died 243 were elk 
four were deer two moose and five bison superintendent bob barbee 
said thursday 
there is no evidence black or grizzly bears in the park were 
killed by fire although a black bear that suffered burns to its 
paws was killed sept 9 by a montana state highway patrolman near 
cooke city mont to the east of the park barbee said 
the number of ungulate moose bison deer deaths caused by 
the fires is a very small percentage of total wildlife populations 
within the park barbee said in a statement yellowstones elk 
population is currently estimated between 30000 and 35000 and 
bison and deer at 2700 and 2000 respectively 
forest fires first were spotted in yellowstone in late june 
several fires still are smoldering and one on the northeastern side 
of the park has yet to be declared under control 
the mortality survey showed that 213 of the animal carcasses were 
found within the perimeter of the north fork fire which was 
humancaused on the west side of the park 
most of the animals probably died of smoke inhalation on sept 9 
when that fire was pushed by 30 mph winds officials said 
the carcasses found were left inplace as extensive 
scavenging activity by bears eagles ravens and coyotes is 
continuing according to park officials

two victims of britains worst subway fire one 
unidentified and the other unclaimed were buried in the same grave 
on friday nearly a year after they died 
the single headstone at st pancras cemetery says they died in 
the terrible fire 
the men were buried a day after an official report blamed 
management complacency and lax safety measures for the nov 18 blaze 
that killed 31 people in the kings cross subway station 
the fire was found to have been caused by a lighted match dropped 
on a wooden escalator 
gerald isaaman chairman of the kings cross disaster fund said 
the funds trustees decided to bury them on armistice day a day 
of remembrance armistice day commemorates the end of world war i 
it is sad to think that two people can die and never be missed 
in our community said canon douglas bean vicar of st pancras 
church who conducted the funeral service it is a reflection of 
city life in the age in which we live 
one man is still known only as 115 the registration number 
his body was given at the hospital police couldnt identify him 
even after checking 55 million fingerprints and circulating photos 
of an expert reconstruction of his face 
the other victim was identified as ralph humberstone by a former 
employer but no family or friends were traced 
we felt that they ought to receive a proper decent burial and 
that they should be remembered said douglas platts manager of 
the disaster fund we chose a single grave because they were two 
lonely souls who died together and therefore we thought it 
appropriate they should be buried together 
the 13 mourners included the mayor and former mayor of camden 
the borough which includes kings cross members of the trust fund 
and aileen walkersmith director of the kings cross support group 
which has been helping families and survivors 
a 250page report based on an inquiry that went on 91 days was 
released thursday and prompted the resignation of the subways two 
top managers it blamed executive complacency and an 
uncoordinated haphazard and untrained staff response for the 
disaster

gustaf wants to establish an official residence in a 40room 
building tucked between the prime ministers office and the foreign 
ministry which just went up for sale 
its last owner leo sager bequeathed it to the roman catholic 
church on condition his wife could stay as long as she lived she 
died in may at the age of 93 
on wednesday his 54th birthday carlsson cleared the idea with 
the countrys political leadership of having a londonstyle 
permanent home for the prime minister 
the home would cost about 98 million according to the sager 
foundation which is selling the building for the church the 
address would be stromgatan 18 
carlsson moved into his home near the royal castle on orders of 
the police who judged his terrace house in stockholm suburb of 
tyreso too difficult to guard 
although convenient it was seen as improper for the head of 
government to rent an apartment from the king who is head of state 
if he gets his birthday wish carlsson would have 1380 square 
yards to share with his wife ingrid since their two grown

the philippine red cross said reports friday from isolated areas 
showed that at least 75 people were killed by widespread flooding 
and landslides on palawan island 250 miles southwest of manila 
floods and mudslides caused by tropical storm tess swamped 
palawan last weekend and typhoon skip worsened the situation with 
more rain early this week said lourdes masing red cross supervisor 
for relief 
before tess and skip typhoon ruby battered most of the country 
oct 2425 
miss masing said many areas on palawan have not been heard from 
because of poor communications and as many as 600 islanders are 
believed missing

landslides and floods hit simultaneously nov 45 
in one area timber piled up at a logging camp crashed down a

the south african rugby board said 
friday it would avoid contact with the outlawed african national 
congress rebuffing efforts by the board president to end south 
africas world isolation in the sport 
the president of the allwhite board danie craven was 
criticized for traveling to zimbabwe last month for meetings with 
black african sports officials including members of the anc 
craven was pursuing plans to form a new rugby union with south 
american and other african countries he announced friday that those 
duties had been passed to another executive member johan claasen 
craven said his efforts to unite the board with the 
antiapartheid south african rugby union would be handled by 
vicepresident fritz eloff who had opposed the anc contacts 
the board or craven did not comment on the meaning of the two 
decisions reached during a closed meeting thursday and announced 
friday but craven made it clear he disagreed with the decision on 
anc contacts 
he told eloff on friday i warn you that the only road to 
africa is through the anc no matter what you do you will have to 
deal with that 
the south africa government regards the anc the main black 
guerrilla group fighting to end apartheid as a terrorist 
organization 
government officials had demanded that the rugby board explain 
its stand on cravens talks threatening an end of government aid to 
the sport most cherished by the politically dominant afrikaners 
shortly after cravens meeting eloff had discussed with the 
international rugby board a possible 1989 world team visit to 
celebrate south africas 100th anniversary of the game 
eloff said anc officials had written to the international board 
urging them not to send a team to south africa eloff said the 
letter showed it was naive to believe that negotiating with the anc 
would help south african rugby 
most international sports organizations have barred south 
africans from competition to protest the governments policies of 
apartheid under which the black majority has no vote in national 
affairs 
last year the international rugby board approved a world team 
visit to south africa but the invited teams or their countries 
refused participation

scientists believe they have discovered the 
fossilized remains of the worlds oldest bug a fuzzy bigeyed 
insect resembling a silverfish that lived some 390 million years in 
what is now canada 
if the dating of the fossil holds up to further examination the 
discovery would push back the origin of insects about 50 million 
years said michael greenfield assistant professor of biology at 
the university of california los angeles 
the fossil was discovered five years ago by francis m hueber of 
the smithsonian institution in washington but its importance was 
only recently discovered when he and other scientists compared notes 
the findings were reported in todays issue of the journal 
science in an article by hueber conrad c labandeira of the 
university of chicago and bret s beall of the field museum of 
natural history in chicago 
this is the oldest insect in the world labandeira said in an 
interview in todays los angeles times 
the fossil found near quebec canada consists of the head and 
two segments of the thorax or upper chest of the wingless insect 
the outside of the head was pitted suggesting the critter had more 
than just scales 
this thing had hair labandeira said 
the insect called a bristletail lived between 390 million and 
392 million years ago he said 
its most imposing features were its two disproportionately large 
eyes on each side of its head it also had two antennae and two 
armlike appendages that appear to have been equipped with sensors to 
detect odors and vibrations 
a surprising part of the discovery was that the insect appeared 
to be about as old as the first land plants said labandeira 
i think early terrestrial life did not lag far behind plants 
he said they came along about the same time or shortly 
thereafter

democratic gubernatorial candidate bruce 
g sundlun the apparent loser by a narrow margin in tuesdays 
election requested a recount today 
perhaps a mistake was made of some significance said 
campaign manager kenneth haupt i dont think its very likely 
neither does anyone else really still it should be checked it 
was very close 
republican edward diprete was reelected by an unofficial margin 
of 6299 votes after tuesday nights initial machine count not 
including 16000 still uncounted absentee ballots and 675 votes 
from one latereporting precinct 
haupt said he requested the recount because he owed it to 
campaign workers and sundluns peace of mind 
a sundlun campaign spokeswoman eileen crochiere said the 
campaign is not alleging fraud 
the governor who was out of town today said wednesday that if 
he were in sundluns position he probably would consider asking for 
a recount 
with all but one precinct reporting from tuesdays election 
dipretes unofficial machine total was 195283 votes or 51 percent 
to sundluns 188984 votes or 49 percent new shorehams results 
were sent in thursday 
a recount would begin wednesday and probably would take three 
days said elections board chairman joseph distefano 
the recount entails opening all 1800 voting machines and 
comparing the numbers on the meters with those reported on sheets 
filled out by precinct workers 
the last statewide recount was in the 1986 attorney generals 
race and did did not change the outcome distefano said

abc president james duffy pledged his 
networks continued support for efforts to fight illiteracy telling 
a meeting here that the united states has the worst illiteracy rate 
of any industrialized nation 
duffy noted that abc and public broadcasting service launched a 
program last year to call attention to the problem television 
programs public service announcements and other broadcasts have 
generated hundreds of thousands of calls to a national hot line he 
said thursday at the governors third annual statewide literacy 
conference 
late next spring abc plans another program on literacy he said 
and part of that will include live broadcasts from town meetings 
to determine how selected communities are dealing with the problem 
of illiteracy 
also thursday television evangelist pat robertson pledged 1 
million to fight illiteracy in mississippi 
robertson chairman of the board of christian broadcasting 
network and the host of the 700 club told a news conference 
hell also lead efforts to raise another 5 million from private 
donations to help teach reading and writing to adults and youths 
robertson speaking at the voice of calvary ministries in 
jackson said his program would establish a statewide network of 
educators and volunteers to move mississippi into the top 10 
literacy rankings over the next 10 years 
duffy told the meeting of educators state officials and business 
leaders the fact is that illiteracy cannot be identified with any 
one state or region or ethic group or in any one socioeconomic 
group it is everywhere in the country 
there are 23 million americans who cannot read or write at the 
fourthgrade level there are 35 to 36 million who cannot read or 
write at the eighthgrade level 
the question is whether the leadership is aware of the problems 
fully aware of the fundamental significance of what it means in 
this country duffy said 
we do have the worst illiteracy rate of any industrialized 
nation in the world thirteen to 15 percent of the national 
workforce is functionally illiterate 
we have a human resource problem in this country that threatens 
our competitive position in the world this is the economic 
imperative behind the rapidly growing literacy movement in this 
country the abc president said

president reagan in his last official 
appearance at a veterans day ceremony delivered an emotional 
message of gratitude to the gentle heroes of vietnam saying 
young americans should never be sent again to fight and die unless 
we are prepared to let them win 
accompanied by his wife nancy reagan walked along the granite 
vietnam veterans memorial paying tribute to the more than 58000 
war dead and said in our hearts you will always be young 
a crowd of several thousand people gathered on the green lawn of 
the mall facing the memorial including several men wearing military 
jackets some in wheelchairs who heckled reagan during his speech 
what they said was inaudible to bystanders the president took no 
note of the heckling 
it was reagans second visit to the memorial he first visited 
the site on veterans day 1984 to dedicate the statue of three 
soldiers 
before he started his speech today reagan was presented with a 
miniature replica of the statue by john wheeler the head of the 
vietnam veterans memorial fund 
in his speech reagan said the us government was doing 
everything possible to learn whether americans are still being held 
against their will in southeast asia he said that unless the hanoi 
government can assure america that this isnt so we will assume 
they are and will do everything we can to get them home 
dan reed of mount pleasant iowa who described himself as a 
vietnam veteran said veterans appreciated the ceremony but didnt 
think the government was doing enough to bring home any remaining 
prisoners of war if you cant bring us home dont send us we 
dont want any white house jive he told a reporter 
reagan said that when he visited the site four years ago he 
voiced the hope that a process of healing had begun and said it 
appears to me that we have healing 
the president noting that he will soon leave office said what 
i can say to our vietnam vets is welcome home reagan also said 
that despite the divisions in america over the vietnam conflict 
who can doubt that the cause for which our men fought was just 
he said the vietnam war was a just cause however imperfectly 
pursued 
reagan said a major lesson of the vietnam war is that young 
americans never be sent again to fight and die unless we are 
prepared to let them win 
earlier reagan spoke to a huge crowd gathered in the 
amphitheater at arlington national cemetery across the potomac river 
in virginia 
he said americans traditionally remember their war dead by laying 
wreaths attending memorial ceremonies and speaking words of 
truth but he said in honoring the dead everyone must recognize 
that they can never be fully ours again that they belong to 
god 
reagan arrived in late morning to a 21gun salute as his 
motorcade approached the amphitheater several thousand men and 
women many wearing their military uniforms stood holding flags 
under a brilliant sun and in the midst of the rich colors of autumn 
foliage 
reagan went immediately to the tomb of the unknowns for the 
traditional presentation of a wreath 
in his brief amphitheater speech reagan called it the highest 
act of patriotism to lay down ones life so that others can live 
and he said one can imagine that as life expired for a victim of 
war those who could had last thoughts of us and of their loved 
ones 
meanwhile presidentelect george bush in a statement issued 
from florida where he is vacationing said this is a special 
veterans day because it is the first since reagan signed into law 
the bill creating the cabinetlevel department of veterans affairs 
this is a distinction that americas veterans have earned and 
richly deserve he said it guarantees that those who have worn 
the uniform of our armed forces will always have a strong voice in 
our government i urge all americans to join president reagan and me 
in celebrating veterans day as a way to honor the true patriots of 
our great nation

here are excerpts from the 
kristallnacht 50th anniversary speech by west german parliament 
president philipp jenninger the 26page speech was translated into 
english by the associated press 
the jews in germany and all the world today remember the events 
of 50 years ago also we germans remember what happened in our 
country a half century ago and it is good that we do this in both 
states on german soil because our history cannot be divided into 
good and bad and the responsibility for the past cannot be divided 
according to the arbitrary geographic postwar order 
 
what happended 50 years ago today right here in germany had not 
occurred since the middle ages in any civilized country and even 
worse the rioting did not come from the expression of a motivated 
spontaneous public rage but an action thought up supported and 
called for by state leadership 
 
the ruling party in the form of its highest representatives 
suspended rights and laws the state itself became the organizer of 
crimes instead of purposeful laws and ordinances with whose help 
the insidious deprivation of jews was carried out for years public 
terror took over a minority of several hundred thousand were 
declared fair game their possessions and property left to the 
destructive rage of an organized mob 
 
far more than 200 synagogues were burned down or demolished 
jewish cemeteries were ravaged thousands of businesses and homes 
damaged and plundered about 100 jews found their death about 
30000 were dragged to concentration camps many of them never 
returned what cannot be described in numbers is the torment 
oppression humiliation mishandling and degradation 
 
nazi propagandist joseph goebbels the director of the entire 
action in some ways made a mistake in his calculations when no one 
domestic or foreign believed in the fiction of spontaneous 
public hate that was seen to by the inactivity of police and 
firemen who stood around and let the synagogues burn and only acted 
when aryan property was endangered 
 
later party court proceedings verified with cynical openness 
that the uniformed sa troops the storm troopers and the other 
arsonists and murderers only carried out the will of the leadership 
in the end only those who had made themselves guilty of sexual 
relations with a nonayran were punished 
 
the public for the most part remained passive that was the 
attitude in regard to antijewish actions and measures in the 
following years only a few joined in the rioting but there was no 
rejection no resistance worthy of mentioning reports speak of 
consternation and shame of pity yes even disgust and horror but 
only a very few were sympathetic gave practical solidarity 
assistance or help all saw what happened but the majority of them 
looked away and said nothing also the churches were silent 
the term reichskristallnacht is today rightly seen as 
inappropriate but it described appropriately the mood and feelings 
then a mixture of embarassment irony and playing down above all 
it was the expression of painfully being moved and of ambivalance of 
ones own feelings faced with open responsibility of the party and 
state leadership 
 
for the fate of the germans and european jews hitlers successes 
were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and misdeeds the 
years from 1933 to 1938 even from a distant retrospective and in 
the knowledge of what followed still are a fascinating thing today 
since throughout history there was hardly a parallel to hitlers 
triumphal procession during the first years 
a reattaching of the saarland implementation of common military 
duty massive arming conclusion of the germanbritish fleet 
agreement occupation of the rhineland the olympic summer games in 
berlin the annexation of austria and the great german reich and 
finally just a few weeks before the november pogrom the munich 
agreement the dividing up of czechoslovakia the versailles treaty 
was really only a scrap of paper and the german reich at once was 
the hegemonial power on the old continent 
for the germans who overwhelmingly had felt the weimar republic 
as the consquence of foreign political humiliation this all must 
have appeared to be a miracle and not only that from massive 
unemployment came full employment from massive misery came a type 
of prosperity for most levels instead of desperation and 
hopelessness there was optimism and selfconfidence 
didnt hitler bring to reality what wilhelm ii had only promised 
that is to lead the germans to glorious times wasnt he chosen by 
providence a fuehrer such as is given to a people only once in a 
thousand years certainly in free elections hitler had never gotten 
a majority of the germans behind him but who wanted to doubt that 
in 1938 a large majority of the germans stood behind him identified 
with him and his policies certainly there were some malcontent 
grumblers who wanted no peace and quiet and were persecuted by the 
sd the nazi security service and the gestapo but most germans 
and in fact from all levels from bourgeoisie as well as from the 
working class could be convinced in 1938 that they were to be 
seeing in hitler the greatest statesman of our history 
and still something else cannot be overlooked all of the 
astounding successes were collectively and individually an 
additional slap in the face for the weimar system 
and weimar was not only synonymous with foreign policy weakness 
party quarrelling and change of government with economic misery 
with chaos street fights and political confusion in a broad sense 
it was also a synonym for parliamentary democracy for checks and 
balances and citizens rights for freedom of the press and freedom 
to assemble and finally for a maximum amount of jewish assimilation 
and emancipation 
that means hitlers successes discredited additionally above all 
the parliamentarily established system of freedom the democracy of 
the weimar itself for many germans there wasnt even the question 
of which system to prefer people enjoyed perhaps in some walks of 
life fewer individual freedoms but it was better for individuals 
than previously the reich was undoubtedly great yes greater and 
more powerful than before hadnt the leaders of great britain 
france and italy visited hitler just then in munich and aided him to 
another one of these successes that hadnt been believed possible 
and as far as the jews were concerned hadnt they claimed for 
themselves in the past a role that wasnt right for them hadnt 
they deserved being put back in their place and above all didnt 
the propaganda apart from the wild exaggeration not to be taken 
seriously correspond in essential points to their own conjectures 
and convictions 
and when it got so bad as it was in november 1938 people could 
still say using the words of a contemporary whats it to us look 
away if it terrifies you it is not our fate 
many germans let themselves be blinded and seduced by the nazis 
many through their indifference made the crimes possible many 
became criminals everyone must answer for himself the question of 
guilt and its suppression 
but what we must all be united against is the raising of 
questions about historical truths the miscalculation of the 
victims the renunciation of facts whoever wants to charge guilt 
whoever says that everything wasnt so or not completely so bad 
he is making an attempt to defend where there is no defense

the national mediation board intervened in the 
labor dispute between northwest airlines and its 4800 pilots 
averting the possibility of a strike at midnight tonight 
the board stepped in at the request of northwest chairman steven 
rothmeier 
members of the air line pilots association voted overwhelmingly 
monday through thursday to set a midnight strike deadline but a 
walkout is illegal under mediation and the union will not strike 
said spokesman tim barzen 
contract talks between the carrier and pilots reached an impasse 
nov 1 over wages work rules and fringe benefits union spokesman 
pete quortrup said negotiators disagree on more than 100 issues 
with 85 percent of the unions pilots voting this week nearly 97 
percent said they would support a strike union spokesman andy 
murphy said today 
under mediation wages and work rules remain unchanged mediators 
handle negotiations until there is a settlement or an impasse at 
which point the board will offer arbitration 
if either side rejects the offer there would be a 30day cooling 
off period before northwest could impose a contract or the union 
could strike 
we intend to schedule mediation sessions at an early date as 
soon as we get someone available said charles barnes executive 
director of the national mediation board in washington 
redmond tyler a northwest spokesman said the threat of a strike 
did not appear to affect ticketing for flights over the weekend 
pilots are flying under two contracts one covering 2000 pilots 
who flew for republic airlines before its 1986 merger with 
northwest the other covering 2800 pilots who flew for northwest or 
have been hired since the merger

in a 925aday parking lot under an elevated 
downtown highway urban archaeologist ricardo elia is searching for 
17thcentury boston 
elia and a team of boston university archaeologists are using 
trowels and brooms to probe repositories of urban detritus before 
construction workers using dynamite reclaim the land forever to move 
the central artery underground 
you just couldnt conceive of someone getting a research grant 
to rip up a parking lot under the artery and see whats there 
elia who heads a 10person bu archaeology team staying several 
steps ahead of construction said as traffic rumbled overhead 
thursday 
after about a month of digging the archaeologists have unearthed 
the soggy timbers of a wharf that a john eustis bought in 1709 on 
property abutting what was then bostons waterfront 
the 846000 federal and statefunded project to search for 
colonial boston is part of a gradual movement to recognize the 
significance of what lies buried under americas cities 
while maps deeds bills of sale and other historical documents 
have been preserved the physical remains of early america are 
scarce archaeologists said 
urban or historical archaeology is only as old as the national 
historical preservation act of 1966 since then new york 
baltimore philadelphia alexandria va charleston sc and 
savannah ga all have let archaeologists examine land before 
development 
what we are getting nationwide are little snapshots on what 
happened in the past in the centers of cities said ron anzalone 
staff archaeologist for the federal advisory council on historic 
preservation in washington 
we learn an awful lot about how boston developed about how 
everyday life occurred that you just cant get from tax records 
he said in many communities there would be no other way to know 
about the early history and how it relates to the development of the 
united states 
the university team has moved from eustis land a quarter mile to 
the other shore of old boston digging under the asphalt on the site 
of a 19th century mattress company warehouse and below that the 17th 
century estate of john codman 
so much of boston has been dug up that youve lost much of the 
archaeological history already elia said the 17th and 18th 
centuries are just not very visible today 
boston prides itself on history yet very little remains of 
colonial boston in fact the paul revere house in the north end is 
the only 17thcentury house standing and it has been heavily 
restored 
one reason is that 1630 boston was much smaller than 1988 boston 
much of which consists of landfill upon which the city gradually 
expanded another is that many of the citys old buildings burned 
down 
elia said the planned excavation of 10 sites along the boston 
highway could indicate how houses were designed and built what 
people ate and how commerce occurred 
preliminary digging about one foot deep into a 40by20feet 
lshaped site on the blackstone allright parking lot has revealed a 
stone foundation of the threestory mattress warehouse an elixir 
bottle halffilled with a yellow liquid turned up thursday 
the deeper archaeologists go the more artifacts they will find 
on the site which housed stables outhouses and a variety of 
buildings 
so far they have found shards of wedgewood pots a widebore 
stem pipe a layer of manure from a stable and other urban artifacts 
the archaeologists used computer generated overlays of a 1630 
outline of the shawmut peninsula modern maps and utility charts to 
determine potential excavation sites along the multibilliondollar 
central artery project scheduled to be completed in 1998 
three of the 10 sites have been excavated and the others should 
be completed by middecember archaeologists will spend the winter 
analyzing timber samples and other artifacts before deciding whether 
a more thorough digging is needed 
whatever they find much more will remain hidden 
youre digging in a city that has continued to build upon 
itself since the beginning said graduate student david landon a 
staff archaeologist of the project

a top plo official said friday a 
declaration of independence for the west bank and gaza strip will be 
a key legal move toward transforming the israelioccupied 
territories into palestine 
from the international legal point of view this will 
consecrate officially the identity of the west bank and gaza said 
bassam abu sharif on the eve of a palestine national council 
meeting the council is expected to approve an independence 
declaration 
abu sharif chief spokesman for plo leader yasser arafat met 
with reporters at the heavily guarded seaside center where the plos 
parliamentinexile begins a fourday meeting saturday 
abu sharif also claimed there were israeli plans to assassinate 
top plo leaders he said a list of intended victims included arafat 
and that one assassination was recently attempted he would not say 
when or where it occurred 
in jerusalem avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak 
shamir responded the imagination of bassam abu sharif has 
apparently been working overtime in anticipation of the pnc and he 
will say anything to get a headline 
the meeting of the 450member council is seen as a historic 
moment in palestinian history and comes during an 11month uprising 
against israels 21year occupation of the territories 
more than 300 palestinians and 11 israelis have died since the 
uprising began dec 8 in the territories israel seized from egypt 
and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
israeli officials say an independence declaration will hurt the 
peace process and incite more antiisraeli violence in the 
territories 
the declaration is irrelevant said a shamir aide yossi ben 
aharon but to our sorrow it will incite the population 
abu sharif told reporters palestinians have a right to a 
state all other details can be negotiated 
this pnc will legislate beyond doubt the line that has been 
presented by chairman arafat for a long time calling for a just 
peace in the middle east and confirming our readiness to sit down 
and negotiate at an international conference abu sharif said 
abu sharif said the next step after the declaration is 
recognition of the state from other nations 
the palestinian meeting comes after jordan severed its links with 
the west bank last summer and after israeli national elections nov 
1 that produced gains by the right which rejects giving up any of 
the occupied territories 
in jordan where 15 million of the worlds 5 million 
palestinians live several refugees doubted their 
parliamentinexile will achieve a decisive breakthrough for a 
homeland in the meetings 
the pnc will talk endlessly as usual said ibrahim abu kheit 
87 who owns a coffee shop in the baqaa camp north of amman 
jordans capital 
support for the pnc meeting came from 17yearold ziad naimeh 
it is for our benefit if they have positive results he 
said but i would not go back to live with an israeli neighbor 
even if my dad insists on returning said naimeh whose family 
fled haifa in what is now israel in the 194748 war

mary and gerald peters wanted all of 
their six children to have a part in naming the latest addition to 
the family 
the result eric michael david stephen joshua kevin carl quentin 
jesse alexander william peters 
it was a little unique to me but i have six other kids and 
each one of them wanted to give him a name said gerald peters 
who has given three of the children multiple middle names 
the parents picked eric kevin carl and william and the 
siblings filled in the gaps for the baby born oct 26 
gerald peters began the tradition of multiple middle names 
belatedly and with his wifes approval because he dislikes his 
first name and wanted his children to have choices he does 
however like his middle name so much that all the boys have a 
william in their name 
the children who dont have multiple middle names ask why he 
said they think its cool they say dad how come you didnt 
give us more names 
gerald william jr 12 contributed the name stephen lucinda 
louise 11 submitted david and joshua terrence but please call 
him terry william 7 recommended michael nathanael fred 
frederick william 6 suggested alexander 
matthew lawrence william 3 gave us jesse the only name he 
could say peters said michelle heather sandra louise peters 
1 is just a baby so we gave her quentin we figured this way when 
she got older she wouldnt argue with us that she didnt get to 
name him too 
the rest of the babys names came from his parents desire for a 
nice round number of middle names 10 
but what do they call him for short

it was a pop quiz that even the teacher flunked 
with more than 200 lawyers jurors and other people crammed into 
his king county superior courtroom for the start of washingtons 
centennial celebration thursday judge gerard shellan asked whether 
anyone knew who was president of the united states when the state 
joined the union on nov 11 1889 
no one answered 
it was grover cleveland shellan said he was the president 
of the united states who approved the admission of the state of 
washington into the union 
wrong it was benjamin harrison who took over from cleveland 
earlier in 1889 after beating him in the 1888 election 
shellan acknowledged his mistake later 
i looked it up after bringing it up in court shellan said 
i obviously should have looked it up first

a federal judge ruled that adoptive parents have no 
constitutional right to records detailing abuses suffered by their 
children before adoption 
us district judge barefoot sanders also ruled thursday that the 
texas department of human services does not have to help pay for 
psychiatric care needed later by children who were abused before 
being adopted 
the rulings were in connection with a lawsuit filed in may by six 
sets of adoptive parents from the dallas area 
the parents charged that the state failed to disclose their 
childrens histories of abuse one family said it learned of its 
13yearold adoptive sons sexual and physical abuse only after he 
threatened to kill family members 
the families had asked the court to compel the state to release 
background information on their adopted children and provide 
financial assistance of up to 20000 a year in some cases 
state officials maintain they provide parents with all essential 
information about children with special needs before adoptions 
become final

an american legion survey contradicting 
government findings says that vietnamera veterans who were exposed 
to heavy combat or the herbicide agent orange suffered more postwar 
health and emotional problems than those who werent 
the legions report released friday and based solely on 
questionnaires returned by veterans themselves is at odds with the 
medical studies of the centers for disease control and the veterans 
administration they found no significant health differences among 
veterans of the vietnam era regardless of whether they actually 
served in southeast asia 
questionnaires were completed by 6810 american legion members in 
six states 
men who faced high levels of combat intensity are at greater 
risk for divorce and for generally being less happy and satisfied 
with their lives their marriages their role as fathers and as 
sexual human beings the legions report said 
although in this population they have reached comparatively 
high levels of education they earn significantly less money than 
peers of their same age and educational attainment it said 
in a section on agent orange the legion study said there were 
significant doserelated relationships between exposure to 
herbicides and subsequent development of skin conditions such as 
rash with blisters and change in skin color 
the study also connected agent orange exposure to benign fatty 
tumors and a doserelated risk for miscarriage among wives of 
agent orangeexposed veterans 
agent orange named for the color of containers used to transport 
and store the chemical was a powerful mixture of two types of 
herbicides it was sprayed in vietnam from 1962 to 1971 to kill 
vegetation such as dense jungle that provided cover and protection 
for viet cong soldiers and their supply routes 
the spraying stopped after laboratory studies showed that dioxin 
one of the agent orange ingrediants caused cancer in laboratory 
animals 
since the end of the vietnam war there have been a number of 
studies both supporting and contradicting the contention that agent 
orange caused ill health among vietnam veterans 
in july the cdc reported that a physical examination of 
thousands of vietnam veterans showed the perceived exposure to 
herbicides is associated both with psychological problems and with 
selfreported adverse health conditions but is not associated with 
objective measures of exposure 
also in july the va reported that based on the physical 
examination of 220000 vietnam veterans there were no unusual 
health patterns 
the american legion survey was conducted over a fiveyear period 
by steven d stellman of the new york city department of health and 
jeanne mager stellman of columbia university it was published 
friday in the scientific journal environmental research 
of the veterans interviewed for the study 42 percent or 2858 
served in southeast asia about 20 percent of that group fell into 
the high combat category meaning they were frequently exposed 
to fire 
among the studys findings 
family income was 2470 less for high combat veterans than for 
men of the same age and educational background 
high combat veterans were four times more likely to have a 
divorce or marital separation than veterans who did not serve in 
southeast asia 
there is a greater tendency to smoke or drink heavily and twice 
the tendency to take tranquilizers or sleeping pills among high 
combat veterans selfreporting of illicit drug use however was 
low 
the rate of posttraumatic stress disorder ranged from 18 to 15 
percent depending on the level of combat experienced ptsd is the 
tendency to experience emotional reactions to lifethreatening 
stress situations long after the situations have passed the study 
said that in some cases the symptoms persisted for as long as 20 
years 
combat was related to the selfreported incidence of high blood 
pressure ulcers and various types of disease

in the east fork cemetery and i go home to glory itll all end 
here

community college was in sharp contrast to a derailed homecoming

for public schools would threaten fundraising efforts for a 
racially segregated private academy 
thats all water under the bridge now said clower who

an animal rights activist was arrested 
today on charges she planted a pipe bomb in an attempt to kill the 
chairman of a surgical equipment company that experiments on dogs 
police said 
police said 33yearold fran stephanie trutt of new hyde park 
ny was arrested setting the radiocontrolled bomb at us 
surgical corp just after midnight 
she was charged with attempted murder possession of explosives 
and manufacturing a bomb and was jailed on 500000 bail 
lt jeff finch said the device was a sophisticated bomb capable 
of killing anyone near it ms trutt planned to detonate it as the 
companys chairman leon hirsch walked by on his way to work finch 
said 
ms trutt is a selfstyled member of animal rights groups and 
considers the policies of us surgical to be an affront to animal 
rights finch said 
hirsch said the bomb was found at the side of the building 10 
feet from his parking space he said about 200 people were working 
in the plant overnight a bomb squad was called in to remove the 
device 
the company has been criticized for using anesthetized live dogs 
to demonstrate its surgical staplers which are used instead of 
stitches to close wounds 
state health officials responding to complaints by animal rights 
groups ruled recently that such use of animals does not violate 
state law 
i think what we and other companies should be doing is telling 
the world what these animal activists are really like hirsch 
said the public thinks theyre a wonderful group of little old 
ladies protecting puppies and pound dogs and so they send in their 
5 
but nothing could be further from the truth these are 
hardcore animal extremists who believe the rights of animals 
supercede the rights of humans 
an animal rights activist who protested us surgicals use of 
animals to the state said the group has absolutely no connection 
with trutt 
we were horrified to learn of this said julie lewin 
connecticut coordinator of fund for animals which claims 250000 
members nationwide we in no way condone any terorrism violence 
toward people does not help animals 
hirsch said us surgical experiments on about 1000 animals 
mostly dogs a year the animals which are obtained from us 
department of agriculture farms are destroyed after experiments are 
completed he said 
us surgical which produces surgical stapling devices employs 
1500 people in connecticut and 2600 nationwide hirsch said

prague and vienna reported 
dissidents and diplomats in prague the raid on a seminar about 
czechoslovak history indicated a tougher attitude toward the growing 
number of activities being conducted outside official circles 
they said nearly all czechoslovaks planning to attend had been 
arrested wednesday and thursday and about 20 were believed still in 
custody friday 
some czechoslovak and foreign participants planned to resume the 
seminar at an undisclosed address said the international helsinki 
federation for human rights based in vienna 
banned playwright vaclav havel eluded arrest thursday and reached 
a prague hotel where the seminar was to begin with a public session 
friday witnesses said 
havel managed to declare the seminar open before three 
plainclothes policemen arrested him said dick knook charge 
daffaires at the dutch embassy in prague 
the playwright was chairman of the organizing committee sponsors 
of the seminar were the charter 77 human rights movement the 
independent jazz section group an independent peace association 
the democratic initiative and the czechoslovakus friendship 
society 
four decades of communist rule and the founding of independent 
czechoslovakia in 1918 were among matters to be discussed in the 
threeday seminar 
knook said another czechoslovak avoided arrest at the hotel 
slipping out while police were busy stopping a western woman 
activist from taking photographs 
a west german tv crew managed to film the scene at the pariz 
hotel in central prague 
foreign participants condemned the arbitrary actions of the 
police and security services to prevent the seminar taking place 
and called the police action a blatant violation of the helsinki 
final act 
they protested to the czechoslovak government western diplomats 
and the helsinki review conference in vienna the helsinki final act 
to human rights provisions of the 1875 helsinki agreements on 
european security and cooperation 
czechoslovakias delegation to the vienna conference said recent

told the diplomats a charming lady with flowers arrived at the 
meeting to distribute warning notes in envelopes to foreigners 
present other witnesses reported plainclothes police handing out 
such warnings

regarded as a manifestation of hostility toward czechoslovakia 
some independent intellectuals not under arrest were physically 
prevented from meeting with the foreigners 
jiri dienstbier a charter 77 signatory told the ap the two 
police vans were in front of his apartment keeping him away from 
the seminar 
dienstbier reached by telephone from vienna said three western 
participants including timothy garton ash a british writer on 
eastern europe rang his apartment bell in the afternoon but were 
kept out by police 
a senior western diplomat also reached by telephone said 
authorities apparently were unnerved by an independent demonstration

a soviet politburo member said friday 
that each nation should decide whether to adopt a multiparty system 
but denied that such a move eventually will prompt hungary to bolt 
from the soviet bloc 
hungary is the first singleparty communist country to debate 
openly the growth of a multiparty system its fostering of political 
pluralism is certain to be closely watched in the soviet union 
at a joint news conference with hungarian politburo member janos 
berecz soviet politburo member alexander n yakovlev said the needs 
of society should determine the type of party system in any given 
country 
berecz chief ideologist of hungarys ruling communist party 
said diverse political interest groups that recently have mushroomed 
in hungary would be given broader scope that could lead to an 
unspecified coalition of parties 
but he cautioned that enacting political reforms is a longterm 
process and emphatically ruled out a reporters suggestion that a 
multiparty system might lead hungary out of the soviet bloc 
we will withdraw from the warsaw pact when nato has 
disbanded berecz told journalists 
hungary has been in the throes of debate over the feasibility of 
a multiparty system evolving in a communist country 
on thursday the government adopted a draft bill on assembly that 
would allow the foundation of political parties 
however the status of such parties and how they would function 
is to be regulated by legislation that is still under consideration 
and probably will not be ready until 1990 
the draft bill is to be presented to parliament for approval 
later this month 
yakovlev said the number of parties in a country or the 
establishment of any party system follows from its internal needs 
and not from intellectual considerations 
the possibility of a multiparty system should be decided by 
the responsible leaders of individual countries he said 
yakovlev was in budapest to wrap up what berecz called a landmark 
agreement on expanding ties between the soviet and hungarian 
communist parties 
the two parties have grown increasingly close since mikhail s 
gorbachev took over as kremlin leader in march 1985 and karoly 
grosz replaced oldtime hungarian party chief janos kadar in may 
the new agreement means the two parties will cooperate on such 
matters as their role in society property ownership and labor 
relations the communist party daily nepszabadsag said 
hungarys mushrooming independent groups some of which are 
political parties in all but name are likely to welcome the 
governments latest move to allow them a legal basis to function 
communist authorities have taken a different attitude to the 
various groups essentially accepting the hungarian democratic 
forum but the soviet blocs first independent youth group the 
federation of young democrats has complained of an official media 
boycott 
hungarys latest action is likely to be watched closely also in 
the soviet unions baltic states where independent political 
movements have recently attracted hundreds of thousands of 
supporters 
those movements which have the approval of baltic communist 
parties grew rapidly after a visit by yakovlev to the baltic states 
last summer 
he said he had heard nothing in the baltics that gave him cause 
for anxiety but cautioned that excessive nationalism would not be 
tolerated 
the more conservative communist governments in czechoslovakia 
which has cracked down hard on independent groups recently and east 
germany are likely to be wary of the move 
when asked about the possibility of a multiparty system evolving 
in the soviet union yakovlev responded i dont understand such 
questions i could ask when will there be real multiparty systems 
elsewhere 
he said he had studied the us party system for years and i 
cant identify a second party any more

the president of parliament resigned 
friday bowing to condemnation of a speech in which he said many 
germans felt adolf hitler brought glorious times before the 
holocaust and global war 
philipp jenninger referred to hitlers early years as a 
triumphal procession in an address that also condemned the nazi 
attempt to annihilate european jews 
the 56yearold christian democrat said he had been 
misunderstood was shocked by the reaction and felt deeply sorry 
for any offense caused by his remarks thursday on the 50th 
anniversary of kristallnacht the rampage against jews that began 
the nazi genocide 
jenninger emphasized his own record as a foe of totalitarian 
regimes 
in a television interview friday night jenninger said he had 
hoped to reach young people by describing horrors of the nazi past 
but you have to learn that you cant call everything by its name 
in germany 
michael fuerst deputy chairman of the central council of jews in 
west germany defended the politician 
i welcome that the parliament president described in full 
clarity what was happening in germany between 1933 and 1938 
especially the fact that everything that hitler did was strongly 
supported by the masses of all germans he said in a television 
interview thursday night 
on friday neue presse of hanover quoted jewish council chairman 
heinz galinski as saying of jenninger no one is supporting him 
thats shown by the numerous protests that have reached me from all 
jewish communities 
whatever his intent jenningers speech contained lengthy 
references to the euphoria many germans felt after hitler gained 
power in 1933 occasionally without counterbalancing statements 
about the nazi atrocities 
he used rhetorical questions in many passages including this one 
and as far as the jews were concerned hadnt they claimed for 
themselves in the past a role that wasnt right for them hadnt 
they deserved being put back in their place and above all didnt 
the propaganda apart from the wild exaggeration not to be taken 
seriously correspond in essential points to their own conjectures 
and convictions 
and when it got so bad as it was in november 1938 people 
could still say using the words of a contemporary whats it to 
us look away if it terrifies you it is not our fate 
about 50 members of parliament began to walk out at that point in 
the speech which was broadcast live on national television 
in his resignation announcement jenninger said the reactions 
to my speech have deeply shocked me and have greatly depressed 
me 
my speech was not understood by many listeners the way i had 
intended it to be i am deeply sorry and i am very hurt if i have 
offended the feelings of others 
during my whole political career i have been active in 
working for reconciliation with the jews and for the vital interests 
of the state of israel 
i always have been an uncompromising foe of every type of 
totalitarian rule he said and cited the experiences of my 
parents under the nazi regime who were opposed to the dictatorship 
and as a result had to accept disadvantages he did not describe 
the disadvantages 
jenninger did not say whether he would continue in parliament he 
has been a member since 1969 and was a close aide to chancellor 
helmut kohl before becoming president four years ago 
the presidency of parliament is largely ceremonial but in terms 
of diplomatic protocol is the no 2 public office after the federal 
presidency 
hansjochen vogel leader of the opposition social democrats 
told reporters after jenningers resignation this event shows us 
how the darkest chapter of german history is still a presentday 
thing 
a statement by the leftist greens party said the background of 
what happened is the inability of many germans to stand up to their 
own past 
an editorial in the frankfurter rundschau said it was perhaps 
the most unfortunate speech that was ever made in the federal 
republic but also said of jenninger you can grant him the good 
intention of wanting to give a worthy perhaps even great 
contribution to the memory of the crimes of the third reich on this 
historic day 
the furor overshadowed west germanys carefully planned 
ceremonies for the anniversary of the night of terror nov 910 
1938 which the nazis named kristallnacht or crystal night for the 
shattered glass that littered the streets 
nazi thugs destroyed 267 synagogues in west germany killed 91 
jews rounded up 30000 for shipment to concentration camps 
destroyed jewish homes and ransacked 7500 jewish businesses the 
same thing happened in austria hitlers homeland which he had 
annexed to the third reich eight months earlier 
kristallnacht began what became known as the holocaust in which 
6 million jews were killed 
in his speech thursday jenninger described the positive feelings 
of many germans in the early hitler years 
didnt hitler bring to reality what kaiser wilhelm ii had 
only promised that is to lead the germans to glorious times wasnt 
he chosen by providence a fuehrer such as is given to a people only 
once in a thousand years 
for the fate of the germans and european jews hitlers 
successes were perhaps even more fateful than his crimes and 
misdeeds the years from 1933 to 1938 even from a distant 
retrospective and in the knowledge of what followed still are a 
fascinating thing today since throughout history there was hardly a 
parallel to hitlers triumphal procession during the first years

more than 70 people were injured in an earthquake 
that hit chinas southeast coast and the number reported homeless 
from another quake in the south earlier this week doubled to 
200000 officials said friday 
no deaths were reported in thursdays quake which shook the 
guangxi zhuang region the official china news service said it 
measured slightly more than 5 on the richter scale and cracked 
buildings and collapsed stairways in cities across the area 
it occurred four days after a quake near the burmese border 
killed more than 930 people the official xinhua news agency quoted 
officials as raising the count of those injured sunday by several 
hundred to 3364 
seismologists said thursdays quake may have been an aftershock 
of that temblor which devastated dozens of remote towns and farming 
villages in yunnan province west of guangxi zhuang it measured 76 
on the richter scale 
the china news service said thursdays quake was centered 
offshore in the beibu gulf it said 71 people were were hurt nine 
seriously as they scrambled from buildings in the city of 
fangcheng it said the trade city of canton also was affected 
trevor page of the un world food program said chinese officials 
told him 200000 people were homeless from the yunnan quake twice 
as many as previously reported 
page said the ministry of civil affairs sent his office a 
detailed list of emergency supply needs including antibiotics 
syringes portable xrays jeeps plastic sheets tents clothing 
and canned food 
xinhua said 75 tons of medicine and 24 tons of food already had 
been sent to the quake area by helicopter truck and horsedrawn 
cart many villages in the area can reached only on footpaths and 
the few existing roads have been heavily damaged by the quake 
xinhua said many remote villages had not yet been reached by 
rescue teams and that the casualty figures were expected to rise 
a strong quake hit the same area in october 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage in a populated 
area and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage

that began hitlers extermination of 6 million jews

said 
in his resignation announcement jenninger said he always had 
opposed every type of totalitarian rule and has been a 
consistent supporter of israel 
he told reporters in 1982 he entered public service because his 
father told him the world must avoid another war like the one hitler 
started in 1939 
two of my brothers died in the war my father told me when i 
was 12 be of service during your lifetime so that something like

four nations resumed talks friday on securing a 
cuban troop pullout from angola and an independence plan for 
southwest africa also known as namibia 
delegations from south africa cuba angola and the united 
states which is mediating opened the new round with a series of 
discussions a south african spokesman said 
the spokesman roland darrol said his delegation came to 
switzerland in a positive frame of mind 
no plans were immediately announced for full meetings of the four 
sides all of which have sent midlevel officials to the talks 
the closeddoor talks part of a series begun in may are due to 
end sunday they are intended to prepare for a furtherround in 
brazzaville congo the date of which have not been set 
the goal is an accord on the withdrawal of an estimated 50000 
cuban troops backing a marxist government in angola a pullout 
agreement is south africas condition for granting freedom to 
southwest africa the former german colony between south africa and 
angola that pretoria has controlled for 73 years 
soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly adamyshin in geneva as 
observer said thursday that the length and timing of the cuban 
pullout was the only remaining issue to be settled 
angolas ambassador to the united nations manuel pedro pacavira 
said in new york an agreement on the withdrawal of cuban troops is 
near and may come during the current talks 
but he said the troop withdrawal is not the major hurdle 
we cannot say that the main obstacle to an agreement is the 
timetable pacavira told reporters he blamed south africas 
attitude of interference in angolas affairs for the current 
impasse in the talks 
but south african delegation leader neil van heerden indicated he 
would also raise an alleged breach by angola of its pledge to keep 
namibian guerrillas north of the 16th parallel in angola 
military units of the southwest african peoples organization 
fighting for namibian independence have bases in southern angola 
pretoria originally proposed nov 1 as target date for 
implementing a un independence plan for namibia 
as it became clear that goal would not be met a us proposal in 
early october reportedly called for cuba to withdraw half of its 
contingent from angola by aug 1 the remaining troops were to be 
confined to northern angola and withdrawn in stages by the end of 
1990 
cuba reportedly wants a 30month timetable six months longer 
than that offered by washington and pretoria 
washington reportedly suggested jan 1 as a new namibia target 
date with elections scheduled aug 1 
but meeting the date seems unlikely according to sources in 
south africa because the un says it would need at least six weeks 
to assemble a peacekeeping force after the signing of an accord 
this would mean that an agreement would have to be signed by 
midnovember

tens of thousands of oil refinery 
workers went on strike friday and threatened to bring brazils 10 
refineries to a standstill unless their salaries are raised 
officials said 
it was the latest in a wave of labor unrest caused by a 
sputtering economy under president jose sarney on wednesday a 
confrontation between striking steelworkers and police and soldiers 
left three people dead 
glaucio heemann a spokesman for the stateowned oil monopoly 
petrobras said half the countrys 60000 oil refinery workers 
walked off their jobs and we expect that by the end of the day the 
other half will do the same 
if this happens the refineries will stop producing their daily 
output of 600000 barrels of gasoline and another 900000 barrels of 
diesel oil cooking gas and other petroleum byproducts heemann said 
he said petrobras has a 20day supply of fuel and if the 
strike lasts this long the country will face serious problems 
durval gomes one of the directors of the rio de janeiro refinery 
workers union said strikers are demanding a 154 percent pay 
increase and that petrobras offered 6727 percent he said refinery 
workers earn an average of 1365 a month 
he said the two sides were expected to resume negotiations soon 
in brasilia the capital 
on wednesday thousands of striking steelworkers angered by 
shrinking paychecks stormed brazils biggest steel mill and hurled 
rocks and bombs at police and soldiers two workers were fatally 
shot and another was bludgeoned to death plant officials said 
the confrontation occurred at the national steel company in volta 
redonda 80 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
brazil has been beset by soaring inflation that erodes buying 
power sarney the first civilian leader after 21 years of military 
rule has been unable to check it 
since sarney took office in april 1985 inflation has jumped from 
72 percent a month to 275 percent in october an annual rate of 
more than 1000 percent 
the cause most economists agree is a federal deficit caused by 
overspending but the governments response has been to lower 
salaries a controversial solution in a country where most workers 
earn less than 30 a week

the federal decision to build a 44 biltional attainment it said 
in a section on agent orange the legion study said there were 
significant doserelated relationships between exposure to 
herbicides and subsequent development of skin conditions such as 
rash with blisters and change in skin color 
the study also connected agent orange exposure to benign fatty 
tumors and a doserelated risk for miscarriage among wives of 
agent orangeexposed veterans 
agent orange named for the color of containers used to transport 
and store the chemical was a powerful mixture of two types of 
herbicides it was sprayed in vietnam from 1962 to 1971 to kill 
vegetation such as dense jungle that provided cover and protection 
for viet cong soldiers and their supply routes 
the spraying stopped after laboratory studies showed that dioxin 
one of the agent orange ingrediants caused cancer in laboratory 
animals 
since the end of the vietnam war there have been a number of 
studies both supporting and contradicting the contention that agent 
orange caused ill health among vietnam veterans 
in july the cdc reported that a physical examination of 
thousands of vietnam veterans showed the perceived exposure to 
herbicides is associated both with psychological problems and with 
selfreported adverse health conditions but is not associated with 
objective measures of exposure 
also in july the va reported that based on the physical 
examination of 220000 vietnam veterans there were no upills among high 
combat veterans selfreporting of illicit drug use however was 
low 
the rate of posttraumatic stress disorder ranged from 18 to 15 
percent depending on the level of combat experienced ptsd is the 
tendency to experience emotional reactions to lifethreatening 
stress situations long after the situations have passed the study 
said that in some cases the symptoms persisted for as long as 20 
years 
combat was related to the selfreported incidence of high blood 
pressure ulcers and various types of disease

a mysterious 21foot unmanned submarine 
discovered off floridas coast may represent the latest in 
drugsmuggling techniques but drug officials are sidestepping 
comment on the underwater capsule 
boat experts say the submarine was designed so a smuggler could 
tow it behind his boat submerging it by remote control if law 
agents approached then retrieving the cargo later 
drug dealers are very creative said police sgt alan dares 
there were no drugs found aboard the sub which was spotted by 
surfers and retrieved thursday by local salvager david kellerman 
the hatch equipped with a wrench could be opened only from the 
outside the redpainted interior of the capsule was empty except 
for 4000 pounds of lead bars serving as ballast it had no 
portholes and apparently was not designed to carry people 
federal drug investigators didnt want to comment 
us customs service officials inspected the sub thursday but 
declined to say anything 
i cant say whether weve seen anything like this before its 
confidential said coast guard petty officer james carr 
keven peterson general manager of ha perry foundation inc 
which builds small submarines in riviera beach said there are 
legitimate purposes for such craft but doubts this submarine was 
engaged in one 
in my 27 years in the business ive never seen anything like 
it it looks like something that would carry cargo like drugs 
peterson said the only other thing it could be used for is 
electronics but it doesnt look sophisticated enough 
discovered wednesday and first dismissed as a barge float 
interest in the mysterious capsule resurfaced when kellerman got it 
to the beach and opened up the hatch 
we didnt know if we were going to find a body everybody said 
it might be jimmy hoffa in it said kellerman referring to the 
former teamsters president who disappeared a number of years ago 
a few wires remained on the subs outside surface possibly the 
umbilical cord of a remote control system it had four air tanks 
two on each side with metal grid walkways over them a rudderlike 
stabilizer 5 feet high and 7 feet wide was at the rear 
one local law enforcement agent who asked not to be identified 
told the fort lauderdale sunsentinel that there is no other use 
for it than drug smugglng 
kellerman can keep the sub if no one claims it police said 
another salvager rick varney estimated the sub is worth 20000

increasing numbers of judges are quitting the 
federal bench because they can make far more money in private legal 
practice two former judges and the american bar association said 
friday in urging a pay increase for the jurists 
the long neglect of the basic need of our federal judges for 
fair and just salaries has reached the point where the effective 
functioning of the federal court system is endangered said robert 
d raven president of the aba in testimony before a presidential 
panel studying pay increases for top federal officials 
raven said an aba review found that dozens of federal judges 
intend to quit because they can earn more in private practice 
ravens statement was echoed by two former judges robert duncan 
of columbus ohio and lynn c higby of panama city fla both told 
the commission they quit to earn more money 
the panel is known formally as the presidents quadrennial 
commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries and it 
meets after every presidential election to review the salaries of 
members of congress judges and top executivebranch officials 
including cabinet officers 
if the panel recommends a pay increase and that proposal is 
endorsed by president reagan in the budget he sends congress on jan 
9 the hike would go into effect unless both the house and senate 
vote against it within 30 days 
members of congress and federal judges are now paid 89500 
while federal appellate judges are paid 94500 
the panel focused friday on judges hearing testimony that 
lawyers in private practice can earn far more than the jurists 
former chief justice warren burger told the panel earlier that 
judicial pay should be raised to 150000 
compensation is the single most important factor in the 
decision of judges to shorten their tenure said raven this 
threat to the stability of the federal judiciary can be averted if 
the promise of adequate judicial compensation is finally kept 
duncan was a judge for 11 years until he resigned in april 1985 
a reason for my resignation was abysmally low pay he said 
in 1985 i was earning 76000 per year certainly compensation 
substantially more than most americans were earning but grossly 
less than lawyers with 33 years experience he said 
duncan said he liked being a judge and the decision to leave 
the bench was agonizing 
but he accepted an offer from a columbus law firm in 1985 because 
at age 57 i had limited productive years ahead and i also knew 
that if i entered private practice i could afford to educate our 
youngest daughter repair our house my wife could retire and 
finally my earnings are somewhat comparable to the income earned by 
a number of law school classmates 
higby was a judge in pensacola fla until he quit in 1982 to go 
back to a law firm 
fortunately i was able to return to the private practice of 
law earning as much if not more than when i went on the bench and 
most importantly was able to fulfill my obligation to my three 
children to see that they had the same educational opportunity that 
was given me by my parents he said

the chief soviet delegate to the 35nation 
helsinki conference on european security and cooperation indicated 
friday that moscow may jeopardize other agreements at the forum if 
it isnt allowed to hold a human rights conference in 1991 
at a news conference yuri b kashlev dismissed demands from the 
united states and britain for better soviet human rights performance 
before the west could agree to moscow holding the conference citing 
what he called those countries poor records on human rights 
the soviets have agreed to a proposal that the moscow conference 
be the third in a series of annual conferences on human rights 
planned after the vienna meeting finishes this year or early in 1989 
the first two conferences are slated for paris in 1989 and 
copenhagen in 1990 
by and large this is a very reasonable optimum structure 
kashlev said in a speech to a closeddoor plenary session of 
diplomats from the 35 nations at the conference 
but if someone wants to break a part of it the whole structure 
will be put in doubt he added 
he noted only one followup meeting in the helsinki process had 
been held in the east bloc since the soviet union the united 
states canada and all european nations bar albania signed the 
helsinki final act in 1975 
those from across the ocean are virtually saying that no 
followup meetings can be conducted in socialist countries 
kashlev said we will not allow that to happen 
the dispute over the moscow conference is one of the main 
outstanding quarrels to be resolved before the vienna conference 
started two years ago can wind up 
diplomats from east west and neutral nations say that most other 
outstanding disagreements have been resolved paving the way for new 
eastwest talks on limiting conventional arms and human rights 
provisions hailed as unprecedented on all sides 
asked about recent police crackdowns in czechoslovakia kashlev 
noted that there are some developments which cause disputes in 
east bloc countries but defended the czechoslovak behavior as being 
in accordance with national laws 
many of the events causing regret in the west are conducted 
with provocative intent he charged 
czechoslovakias recent behavior has provoked speeches from the 
us and british delegations charging prague is violating the spirit 
and the letter of the helsinki accords on security cooperation and 
human rights in europe

democrat bruce g sundluns campaign on 
friday asked for a recount in the gubernatorial election he narrowly 
lost to incumbent gov edward diprete 
kenneth haupt sundluns campaign manager handdelivered the 
letter to the board of elections where workers labored through the 
veterans day holiday to count about 16000 absentee ballots sundlun 
hoped those ballots would decrease further the margin between 
himself and diprete 
it was a very close election and we thought we owed it to the 
campaign staff and all the people who worked hard for him haupt 
said we also owed it to bruce and his piece of mind to make sure 
that the vote that was reported on tuesday was in fact what happened 
on election day 
absentee ballots from nine communities including strongly 
democratic providence added 143 votes to the unofficial 6299 
margin by which diprete led sundlun 
the elections board had counted about 5000 of the mailedin 
ballots and expected to finish counting saturday said janet 
armstrong secretary to the board 
sundluns spokeswoman eileen crochiere said neither haupt nor 
sundlun was alleging fraud 
were pretty realistic that there may be some shifting in the 
numbers but it probably wont change haupt said 
diprete who was out of town had said wednesday that if he were 
in sundluns position he probably would consider asking for a 
recount 
joseph distefano elections board chairman said any recount 
would begin wednesday and take at least three days 
the recount entails going to all 1800 voting machines opening 
the back with representatives from each campaign present and 
comparing the numbers on the meters in the machines with the numbers 
reported on sheets filled out by precinct workers distefano said 
state police are guarding the machines ms armstrong said 
ms armstrong said the election results cannot be certified until 
after the recount the last statewide recount was in the 1986 
attorney generals race and did not change the outcome distefano 
said 
with all but one precinct reporting from tuesdays election 
dipretes unofficial machine total was 195283 or 51 percent to 
sundluns 188984 or 49 percent

peace talks between iran and iraq recessed friday 
after seven direct sessions produced no tangible progress toward a 
permanent peace agreement 
but in separate negotiations with the international committee of 
the red cross both agreed to exchange by dec 31 all sick and 
wounded prisoners captured during the 8yearold war 
iraq and iran agreed to resume the negotiations in the near 
future possibly in december or january said un mediator jan 
eliasson 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has urged the two 
governments to use the recess for deep reflection and to take 
steps to move the peace process forward eliasson said after the 
50minute meeting 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran said the meetings 
brought a better climate and we do hope that the next round will 
achieve practical progress 
his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz said iraq will do its best 
to make the next round fruitful 
contacts will continue with both sides to ensure careful 
preparations so that the next round will provide us with results 
eliasson said 
iran and iraq have reaffirmed their commitment to uphold the 
ceasefire and to implement un resolution 598 which calls for a 
comprehensive peace settlement he said 
eliasson gave both sides credit for their positive cooperation 
with the international committee of the red cross in accepting a 
red cross proposal to begin nov 20 with the exchange of 1569 sick 
and wounded prisoners 
the red cross said both sides promised to provide lists of all 
other disabled prisoners who will be repatriated starting dec 5 
the program must be completed not later than dec 31 the red 
cross said in a statement 
but eliasson told a news conference that the talks remain stuck 
on the points of immediate concern listing a provision to 
withdraw forces to internationally recognized borders without delay 
a un report said at some border positions troops are only 
paces apart 
president ali khamenei of iran blamed the lack of an agreement on 
iraqs continued presence on iranian soil 
we regard the presence of iraqi troops in our territory a sign 
of war and if the iraqi leadership is serious in its quest for 
peace it must remove this sign from our territory khamenei said 
friday at tehran university 
he said no other moves in the negotiations could be accepted 
until the troops are withdrawn his remarks were carried on tehran 
radio and monitored in cyprus 
iraq has not denied an iranian claim that iraqi troops still hold 
386 square miles of iranian territory while no iranian soldier has 
remained on iraqi soil 
iran insists that the withdrawal be based on a 1975 border treaty 
which president saddam hussein of iraq ripped up five days before 
his divisions moved into iran in 1980 iraq says the treaty must be 
renegotiated 
eliasson said the united nations presented both sides with 
certain ideas regarding the issue but declined to say whether 
these were based on the 1975 treaty 
the atmosphere at the third round which started oct 31 was 
described by eliasson as constructive and sober but he made 
clear that the climate remained chilly and that both sides generally 
refused to speak to each other 
there is a dialogue one speaks in front of each other he 
said adding that during coffee or tea breaks there are occasions 
you could detect something that could also be called conversation

looking to earn more than 68000 next year if 
so here are some possibilities 
special negotiator in the state departments bureau of economic 
and business affairs 
associate commissioner in the disability office at the 
department of health and human services 
director of the intergovernmental affairs office at the 
education department 
these positions and thousands more are contained in an oversized 
230page manual that washington insiders call the plum book a 
compilation of political jobs published every four years with the 
change of administration 
the book formally entitled policy and supporting positions 
is a usually a bestseller more than 500 copies of the 14 book had 
sold thursday the day after the manual was put on sale at 
bookstores run by the government printing office gpo spokewoman 
carlyn crout said 
the stores were closed friday a federal holiday 
william g norton of the office of personnel management said 
there are differences between this years book and the edition that 
came out four years ago 
for one thing fewer jobs are listed 
opm sought to make the book a document that is more realistic 
and didnt contain a lot of extraneous positions norton said as 
a result 8000 jobs outside the competitive civil service are 
listed compared to 10000 four years ago 
among the slots that were dropped judgeships that already are 
filled 
the book also came out the day after vice president george bush 
was elected to the presidency four years ago jobseekers waited 
until february for the book 
although the book has about 8000 jobs norton said the bush 
people will only have about 3000 to 4000 fulltime slots open 
because of laws governing the civil service also up for grabs on 
are about 1400 positions on presidential boards and commissions 
that are generally compensated at a daily rate he said 
civil service laws prohibit politicians from filling all the top 
jobs with noncareer people 
for instance no more than 10 percent of the senior executive 
service jobs those paying between 68700 and 80700 in 1989 
can be filled by noncareer people so the book lists all the jobs 
available but only a set number may be taken by people outside the 
civil service norton said 
additionally the book lists all senior foreign service jobs yet 
noncareer people are only allowed to occupy 5 percent of those 
positions 
bushs transition office opens for business on monday but plenty 
of people have already submitted resumes chase untermeyer the man 
bush named as director of personnel for the transition said 
thousands of people had applied for work in the new administration 
although the personnel management office compiles the jobs the 
book is printed for the house committee on post office and civil 
service which directed agencies to provide descriptions of the 
political jobs

we are pleased grateful elated you name it said annie 
snyder a civil war buff who organized the movement to stop the 
building project adjacent to the manassas national battlefield park 
its a tremendous victory and were awfully relieved 
the administration had opposed the proposal to purchase a 
540acre parcel adjacent to the manassas national battlefield park 
because of its projected 60 millionplus cost but the measure was 
attached to a bill that reagan signed amending the sweeping tax 
overhaul enacted in 1986 
developer john t hazel had planned to build a 12 
millionsquarefoot shopping mall 17 million square feet of office 
space and 560 homes on the site but preservationists complained the 
measure would violate the stillrustic sanctity of the 4200acre 
park where two crucial civil war battles were fought 
reps robert mrazek dny mike andrews dtexas and frank 
wolf rva fashioned a plan that called on the government to 
acquire the entire development tract close two heavily traveled 
commuter routes running through the battlefield and pay up to 30 
million for construction of new roads around the park the house 
overwhelmingly passed the legislation in july 
however sen dale bumpers dark rejected lessexpensive 
compromise measures and sponsored a bill identical to the house 
version after bumpers succeeded in getting the bill through the 
energy and natural resources committee he serves on the measure was 
attached to the tax bill passed by the senate 
a key to the movements success was a groundswell of support from 
around the country including more than 80000 petition signatures 
asking congress to buy the land snyder said 
its been the most incredible grassroots effort ive ever 
seen snyder said it shows when the people of the nation get 
behind something theres still a way for the little guy to win 
the park west of washington dc includes the site of the 
first and second battles of manassas also known as bull run after a 
creek in the area 
the proposed development site includes a hill from which 
confederate gen robert e lee commanded his troops in a stunning 
victory in the second manassas historians also have testified that 
unmarked graves of union and confederate soldiers were scattered 
throughout the site

the crowds visitng the cincinnati zoo to see a 
giant panda have not met expectations and there could be a 
shortfall in revenue to for an international program to encourage 
panda breeding officials said 
the 290pound chia chia arrived in september from the london zoo 
the 16yearold male will stay until nov 28 when he is to move on 
to permanent new quarters at the chapultepec zoo in mexico city to 
take part in a breeding program 
when the cincinnati zoo opened its giant panda exhibit sept 3 
officials predicted 500000 people would visit bringing in 200000 
to fund a permanent panda home in mexico and perhaps as much as 
400000 more for an international panda conservation fund 
but with 17 days remaining zoo officials are not sure the 
200000 has been raised by the 300000 people who have come to see 
chia chia 
were hoping we at least make that zoo executive director ed 
maruska said 
most of the money raised so far from the panda is earmarked for 
the chapultepec zoo which has the best record outside pandas 
native china for breeding the animals 
that would leave little for the conservation fund that is to be 
jointly administered by the london and cincinnati zoos the fund was 
a key point cincinnati zoo officials used in winning us fish and 
wildlife service permission to exhibit chia chia 
the zoo advanced the chapultepec zoo 120000 maruska said he 
said his zoo will likely pay the additional 80000 even if revenues 
after expenses do not reach that 
i cant speak for the zoological society but i dont see how 
we could do anything else maruska said

current and former prison inmates have sued 
the texas department of corrections claiming some prison work 
details forced them to handle asbestos without protective equipment 
the suit filed this week in travis county district court by 23 
current and seven former prisoners said the inmates breathed 
asbestos particles and the substance became packed in their 
noses mouths eyes and hair 
the inmates seeking unspecified damages claim the department 
violated their civil rights and was negligent 
lung tests have been performed on some inmates and the records 
reflect that the tests are given because of exposure to asbestos 
the suit said it didnt say whether the inmates developed 
asbestosrelated illness 
tdc spokesman david nunnelee said im not going to respond to 
any of that while this is in litigation 
emily young a dallas lawyer handling the suit said the inmates 
contacted her but she declined to comment further 
the lawsuit said the inmates were ordered to remove asbestos 
insulation with their bare hands and without breathing devices or 
other protective equipment 
the asbestos was then thrown on the floor and broomswept dry 
by other inmates the lawsuit said the sweeping of the dry 
asbestos fibers would cause the previously airborne asbestos fibers 
to again become airborne 
the inmates stuffed the insulation into garbage bags that were 
thrown into pickups the suit said then it said prison guards 
ordered one or more inmates to physically search through the bags 
completely unprotected for inmates who might be trying to escape

two astronauts who flew aboard the space 
shuttle discovery returned to their home state friday to the cheers 
of hundreds of flagwaving parents and children 
a high school band struck up the national anthem while george 
pinky nelson and david hilmers stood at attention on a flatbed 
truck bearing a sign welcome heroes the pride of clinton 
county 
thank you for playing the national anthem hilmers said 
ever since the mission hearing the national anthem gives me a 
particular sense of emotion 
hilmers said he felt anxious on the launch pad moments before the 
sept 29 liftoff but thoughts of home calmed him 
i knew back here in clinton county that many prayers were going 
up with us he said it made the launch much much easier 
the successful discovery mission revived the us space shuttle 
program which had grounded since the challenger exploded on jan 
28 1986 killing its seven crew members 
nelson 38 born in charles city and hilmers who was born in 
clinton but reared in dewitt were greeted by an enthusiastic crowd 
of people craning necks and pointing fingers as the airplane 
carrying the astronauts landed at the tiny airport here 
those two men are real heroes who were willing to go up in 
space after that tragic challenger accident said paul eastland 
73 of clinton were all pround of them 
behind eastland stood betty and joe soletski of de witt 
all of them are really special they have to be to take that 
job mrs soletski said 
if i was young enough id like to go id love to go on one of 
those shuttle trips her husband said i think thats where our 
future lies anyway 
later at a school the astronauts recounted their experiences in 
space they also told students not to forget veterans day 
what veterans day is to me is that it means there are things in 
life far more important than life itself hilmers said there 
were people who felt their country was important enough that they 
risked their lives for it 
pinky and i we felt returning the nation to space was a goal 
worth risking our lives for he said

a judge cleared a convenience store clerk of 
disorderly conduct for serving an oversalted ham sandwich a 
practical joke that a trooper with high blood pressure found in bad 
taste 
trooper william cruz testified thursday that although ham is 
naturally salty he is a picky eater and knew that salt had been 
added to the hoagie state trooper barry gaston picked up for him at 
a 7eleven store on july 24 
cruzs supervisor cpl joseph fuentes said he tasted the 
sandwich and assigned gaston to investigate store clerk david 
uriarte 16 and paul newmayer 21 of ottsville were charged 
shortly afterward 
fuentes noted at the time that cruzs high blood pressure could 
be aggravated by salt and said the charge was a message to 
pranksters not to mess with troopers food but ferndale district 
justice elizabeth leonard acquitted the teenager after a 2hour 
trial and even the local prosecutor belitted the troopers bid for 
nosalt assurance 
they must not have had anything to do that day bucks county 
district attorney alan rubenstein said of the decision to 
investigate 
newmayer was convicted earlier of disorderly conduct which is 
punishable by up to a 300 fine he testified that while waiting at 
the 7eleven to meet some friends he put extra salt on the 
hamandcheese hoagie he said uriarte was in on the practical 
joke but uriarte denied any part in the tampering 
rubenstein said he considered the charges so ridiculous he would 
not prosecute the case if newmayers conviction got to the common 
pleas court level on appeal 
if messing up food were a criminal offense my motherinlaw 
would be in jail rubenstein told the philadelphia daily news

the voyager 2 spacecraft flying through 
space 26 billion miles from earth fired its thrusters friday to 
change course for its august 1989 picturetaking encounter with the 
planet neptune nasa said 
responding to radio signals radioed from earth voyager 2 fired 
its hydrazine thrusters for three minutes and 29 seconds beginning 
at 655 am pst said a statement issued by the space agencys 
jet propulsion laboratory 
flight engineering manager lanny miller said radio signals sent 
to earth by the space probe indicated the maneuver succeeded 
the preplanned course correction will bring voyager 2 some 6200 
miles closer to the solar systems eighth planet but another major 
maneuver next april and several subsequent but minor trajectory 
changes will be required before the neptune flyby said laboratory 
spokeswoman mary beth murrill 
the spacecraft which passed by jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 
and uranus in 1986 is scheduled to sweep within 3000 miles of 
neptunes cloud tops at 9 pm pdt next aug 24 taking pictures 
with its television camera 
five hours later it will fly within 24000 miles of neptunes 
moon triton which scientists believe may have lakes of liquid 
nitrogen 
murrill said voyager 2 is 4147 million miles from neptune one 
of the solar systems giant gaseous outer planets 
radio commands to the probe and its response signals are 
transmitted through large dishshaped radio antennae that make up 
the deep space network operated by the national aeronautics and 
space administration in spain australia and goldstone calif 
voyager 2 is so far away that the signals take four hours to 
reach it even traveling at the speed of light 
the neptune encounter will be the last of the socalled grand 
tour of the outer planets by the voyager probes voyagers 1 and 2 
were launched from cape canaveral fla in 1977 voyager 1 which 
visited jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 now is headed out of the 
solar system 
scientists have called the voyager mission humanitys most 
productive space exploration effort because the two picturetaking 
probes learned hundreds of times more about the outer planets than 
all previous studies combined 
nasa scientists have said that by 1995 when both probes are 
searching for the edge of the solar system the total cost of the 
mission will be about 920 million which is less than half what the 
pentagon spends during one workday 
among key voyager discoveries were active volcanos spewing sulfur 
on jupiters moon io an icy volcanism that produced glacierlike 
flows on some of the saturnian and uranian moons and the discovery 
of at least 17 previously unknown moons three at jupiter at least 
four at saturn and 10 orbiting uranus 
the probes also discovered new rings encircling jupiter saturn 
and uranus orange smog and ethanemethane rain on saturns moon 
titan and dozens of giant hurricanes on jupiter

in the coastal region between half moon bay and bodega bay that was 
the biggest catch since 195960

198687 to 16 million pounds 
this years season opened tuesday but most boats stayed in to 
allow crew members time to vote the weather was bad wednesday but 
by thursday it became evident that crabs were scarce 
its not even an eighth of what the boats got last year said 
joe cincotta manager of the alioto fish co last year they got 
eight to 12 crabs per pot today it was two or three 
phil swartzell of the state department of fish and game said the

an animalrights activist was arrested 
friday on charges she planted a radiocontrolled pipe bomb in an 
apparent attempt to kill the head of a company that experiments on 
dogs police said 
fran stephanie trutt 33 of new hyde park ny was captured 
shortly after midnight as she left the grounds of us surgical 
corp police said 
ms trutt is a selfstyled member of several animal rights 
groups and considers the policies of us surgical to be an affront 
to animal rights said police lt jeff finch 
she was charged with attempted murder possession of explosives 
and manufacturing a bomb and was being held under 500000 bond 
pending an appearance monday in norwalk superior court police said 
police had staked out the company which produces surgical 
stapling devices after receiving information that it might be the 
target of violence finch said 
officers saw trutt enter the grounds with a package and leave it 
in some bushes about 10 feet from chairman leon hirschs vacant 
parking space finch said 
trutt was carrying a radiocontrolled detonator for the bomb when 
she was arrested he said finch initially said trutt planned to 
explode the bomb as hirsch walked into building but he said later 
he didnt know when she planned to explode the bomb or whether 
hirsch was definitely the target 
he described the device as a sophisticated bomb capable of 
killing anyone near it a stamford police bomb squad removed it 
about 200 people were working in the plant overnight hirsch said 
the potential loss of life made the incident the most serious of 
more than 100 animal rights actions including breakins vandalism 
and demonstrations over the past decade said frankie trull 
president of the washington dcbased foundation for biomedical 
research the most serious previous incident was a 35 million 
arson at the university of california at davis in 1987 trull said 
the fbi is investigating for possible federal charges including 
terrorism police said 
us surgical which employs 2600 people nationwide conducts 
experiments on about 1000 animals mostly dogs a year hirsch 
said the animals which are obtained from us department of 
agriculture farms are destroyed after experiments he said 
state health officials last month upheld the companys use of 
anesthetized live dogs to demonstrate its equipment for surgical 
stapling a process that replaces stitches to close wounds and 
incisions 
the new yorkbased fund for animals which had filed the 
complaint over the dog experiments said it had no connection with 
trutt 
we were horrified to learn of this said julie lewin the 
organizations connecticut coordinator we in no way condone any 
terrorism violence toward people does not help animals 
hirsch said he had never spoken to or received letters from trutt 
i think what we and other companies should be doing is telling 
the world what these animal activists are really like hirsch said 
the public thinks theyre a wonderful group of little old 
ladies protecting puppies and pound dogs he said but nothing 
could be further from the truth these are hardcore animal 
extremists who believe the rights of animals supercede the rights of 
humans

signed it with president reagan last january and his conservatives 
win a parliamentary majority in the nov 21 elections 
the environics research group poll published by the toronto globe 
and mail newspaper indicated 51 percent of 1275 eligible voters 
polled nov 38 oppose the agreement an increase of 9 percent since 
the election campaign began last month 
it said 39 percent of those querried supported the pact and the 
rest were undecided the margin of error was 27 percent 
an environics poll at the campaigns outset showed 44 percent in 
favor and 42 against the trade pact 
the latest poll also found 44 percent of canadians would rather 
renegotiate the agreement than tear it up 
both john turners liberal party and the socialist new democratic 
party led by ed broadbent oppose the agreement and the liberals have 
made spectacular gains in opinion polls 
a poll published thursday also by environics showed 37 percent 
of those questioned supporting the liberals 35 for the 
conservatives and 24 for the new democrats 
most analysts believed when the campaign began that mulroney 
would win a majority and some predictions put the liberals in third 
place which would have been a dismal showing for such a dominant 
force in canadian politics 
the uscanada pact eliminates tariffs and reduces other 
barriers in nearly every facet of the 150 billion annual trading 
partnership phasing in the changes over 10 years the us senate 
approved the agreement 839 in september but it still needs final 
approval from parliament 
mulroney says it is necessary to guarantee canadian access to the 
vital us market despite growing protectionism below the border 
and argues that the pact will create jobs and promote future 
prosperity 
opponents contend canada is outweighed in the agreement by the 
greater size and economic clout of the united states they also say 
it may affect canadas strong social and health care programs 
mulroney dismisses those contentions as false scare mongering

members of the ruling politburo flew to the restive 
baltic republics friday and one warned residents against pushing 
too hard for economic and cultural autonomy from moscow local 
journalists reported 
dissatisfaction in estonia latvia and lithuania has been fueled 
by political reforms proposed by president mikhail s gorbachev 
baltic residents say the changes will void their constitutional 
right to secede and give moscow control over their economy and other 
aspects of life 
the politburo the communist partys supreme body promised 
thursday to hold a discussion on expanding the rights of the 15 
constituent soviet republics but the dispatching of three of its 
members to the baltic region indicated the kremlin wants to draw the 
line now on what sort of political changes can be contemplated 
the 1500member supreme soviet parliament is to meet in special 
session in moscow on nov 29 to approve gorbachevs blueprint for 
political change which also increases the powers of the 
presidential post and creates a new national legislature 
viktor m chebrikov the former kgb chief who now heads a party 
central committee commission on legal and judicial reform opposed 
demands for local economic independence in comments to workers at a 
plastics factory in tallinn estonia according to tarmu tammerk an 
estonian journalist 
he said very strong words against economic independence he 
said the whole of the soviet economy is so tightly linked that one 
cannot speak of independence for one of its parts tammerk who 
works for the newspaper homeland said in a telephone interview 
chebrikovs remarks were broadcast on staterun estonian radio in 
an attempt to give them the widest possible exposure 
his words sounded like a grim warning to people here tammerk 
said 
economic independence has been the watchword of a widespread 
movement in estonia called the popular front which seeks greater 
control by estonians over the affairs of their switzerlandsized 
republic 
estonians say the fruits of their labor are siphoned off by 
moscow to subsidize poorer regions of the country including the 
giant russian federation the largest soviet republic 
two of chebrikovs colleagues on the politburo traveled to the 
other baltic states ideology chief vadim m medvedev to latvia and 
nikolai n slyunkov who is in charge of formulating the partys 
social and economic policy to lithuania 
their arrivals were reported by staterun media in the baltic 
republics journalists there said 
later the evening television news program vremya broadcast brief 
reports on the visits tass the official news agency said medvedev 
outlined limits to political activity in meetings with workers at 
two factories in riga the latvian capital 
tass said latvians agreed with medvedev on the need to 
subordinate group ambitions to the interests of society as a whole 
in the conditions of perestroika 
however during his visit to the norma factory in tallinn 
chebrikov heard estonians object to elements of gorbachevs 
political reform plan vremya said 
the westwardlooking baltic republics independent states until 
the soviet union absorbed them in 1940 have become a proving ground 
for bold economic reforms that are part of gorbachevs drive for 
perestroika or restructuring 
granting a greater degree of autonomy to the small republics on 
the soviet unions western edge is fraught with political risks 
since many residents resent moscows control and some openly say 
their ultimate desire is complete independence 
the estonian popular front and a similar organization in latvia 
have condemned gorbachevs political reform plan which is embodied 
in proposed amendments to the 1977 constitution the lithuanian 
restructuring movement is to meet sunday in vilnius the republics 
capital to consider the issue 
members of the three popular fronts are now gathering signatures 
on petitions asking that the amendments be dropped and rewritten 
algimontas vaishnoras of the lithuanian group said in a telephone 
interview 
the estonian supreme soviet or parliament has scheduled a 
meeting on the political reform issue for wednesday and lithuanias 
legislature will meet the next day 
the 12man politburo in a report on its thursday night meeting 
said authorities will consider changing the draft constitutional 
changes in response to more than 80000 suggestions and comments 
from citizens and organizations 
friday night the central committee announced it would hold a 
special plenary meeting in mid1989 to review policies dealing with 
the countrys more than 100 ethnic groups 
the task of perfecting relations among nationalities is 
acquiring special importance and urgency a central committee 
statement said according to tass

two north carolinians detained by laotian 
authorities on oct 2 while on a prisoner of war rescue mission are 
expected to be released soon a state department official said 
friday 
donna long of jacksonville and james copp of hampstead were 
taken into custody while distributing leaflets advertising a 24 
million reward for the return of a living american prisoner from the 
indochina war 
donald stader a state department official responsible for 
southeast asia said in a telephone interview laotian authorities 
agreed to release the pair in return for 1500 in administrative 
costs 
that sum was based on a judicial proceeding in vientiane the 
laotian capital where ms long and copp were taken after they were 
detained in a remote area of the country stadler said 
another condition imposed by the laotians stader said was that 
a us veterans group cancel a demonstration it had planned for the 
laotian embassy in washington on friday to protest the detention of 
ms long and copp 
after being advised of the laotian conditions the national 
steering committee for american vietnam war veterans canceled the 
protest and turned over the 1500 fee to stader laotian 
authorities subsequently were notified that both their demands had 
been met 
stader said he was not aware of any further obstacles to the 
release of the americans both have been well treated he said 
copp and ms long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to 
the lao side of the mekong river when they were detained they were 
said to be attempting to float packets containing reward notices 
written on us dollar bills and other paper currency the river 
borders on or cuts through laos cambodia and vietnam where a 
combined total of about 2400 americans are unaccounted for 
after the americans were detained state department spokesman 
charles redman said private efforts to obtain information about 
missing americans are counterproductive 
we understand the motives behind this kind of effort redman 
said but our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing uslao 
cooperation to resolve the powmia issue 
we also are concerned that any reward reinforces the perception 
widely held in indochina particularly among refugees that 
information and remains are items of barter 
the spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous 
attempts to obtain information about american pows through the 
offer of rewards has produced positive results

republican denny smith won a fifth term in 
congress with a margin of 670 votes over democratic challenger mike 
kopetski after the final ballots were counted friday in oregons 5th 
district race 
the final unofficial tally showed 111157 votes for smith and 
110487 for kopetski a state representative 
the election hinged on some 20000 absentee and previously 
uncounted ballots in clackamas county 
the margin of victory was great enough to avoid an automatic 
recount 
recounts are automatic if the victory margin is less than 
onefifth of 1 percent of the total votes cast 
smiths reelection leaves the house with 174 republicans and 259 
democrats two races one in florida and one in new york remained 
too close to call but democrats held narrow leads in both contests

have the power to sneak jesus into the news as often as 
possible kdlttv weekend anchor marilee joyce wrote 
on numerous occasions she used her position to prevent broadcast 
of network stories that she said were of questionable nature 
she wrote in good news a magazine published by team television a 
christian cable television station 
these included series on the new age movement and on the hare 
krishna religion i decided it would not be good to fill our 
viewers minds with such information so i didnt permit the stories

the government has agreements with britain denmark 
and other countries requiring their citizens to prove themselves 
free of the aids virus in order to enter the soviet union pravda 
reported friday 
in its report of an interview with alexander i kondrusev deputy 
health minister the communist party daily did not say whether the 
accords already were in force or when they would take effect 
a spokesman for the foreign office in london speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british practice said he was unaware of 
any agreements but the soviet union introduced certain 
regulations for foreigners over a year ago thats all we know 
no requirement of aids tests for visa applications has been 
reported 
the soviets who once called the deadly disease a purely foreign 
problem caused by western sexual decadence have expressed growing 
concern about it 
tass reported the countrys second aids death tuesday a 
4monthold child from the odessa region on the black sea apparently 
infected by its mother a 29yearold leningrad prostitute died of 
aids in september 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which no cure has been 
found is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
pravda quoted kondrusev as saying one way to combat the spread of 
aids was the exchange of certificates which by agreement with 
another country require anyone coming to our country or leaving it 
to show a document that proves negative results from a test for 
the virus 
today such an agreement already exists with the countries of 
comecon great britain denmark and others he said comecon is 
the soviet bloc equivalent of the european economic community 
kondrusev said existing regulations require all foreigners 
staying more than three months to undergo mandatory checkups for 
aids 
that requirement which the soviets said early last year was 
under study never has been mandatory for the thousands of western 
diplomats business people and journalists who live in moscow it 
was not clear whether kondrusevs remarks presaged wider enforcement 
some african students who have tested aidspositive have been 
deported according to soviet media reports 
kondrusev said the soviet union had more than 80 carriers of the 
aids virus he said that was low compared with 70000 aids patients 
in the united states but the number of soviet carriers had nearly 
tripled this year

european health officials published a 
statement of nonsmokers rights friday that will be submitted to 
governments as part of a campaign against tobacco 
the draft document which recognizes the right to a smokefree 
environment in public areas and at work was part of a report 
presented at the end of the first european conference on tobacco 
policy 
richard peto of oxford university in england said tobacco kills 
500000 europeans a year and 100 million alive today will die if 
current smoking patterns continue 
what is needed is to inform the governments he said an 
increasing number of people concerned even at the ministerial 
level are beginning to realize these are real deaths of real 
people 
a final version of the document is to be distributed early next 
year by the world health organization which joined spains ministry 
of health and consumer affairs in sponsoring the madrid conference 
officials from six countries said their governments would 
consider adopting the document in combination with higher tobacco 
taxes and bans on tobacco advertising 
they included three health ministers julian garcia vargas of 
spain philippe busquin of belgium and tove s gerhardsen of norway 
and lowerlevel officials from italy france and portugal 
all said they agreed with much of the statement including the 
rights to air free from tobacco smoke in enclosed public places 
and transport help for smokers to break the habit and information 
on the unparalleled health risks of tobacco use 
agreement was not universal on banning tobacco at places of work 
and eliminating all advertising 
garcia vargas said we cannot have laws for everything it is 
better to persuade 
ms gerhardsen said legislation to increase the price of tobacco 
products ban advertising and create smokefree environments have 
been essential in reducing norways consumption of tobacco to one of 
the lowest in europe 
the law is necessary because there will always be people who 
dont cooperate with agreements she said 
spain passed a law this year that puts restrictions on smoking 
and negotiated an agreement with tobacco companies to limit 
advertising statistics indicate spain is second only to greece in 
per capita consumption of tobacco in europe

more than 900 people who feared arrest 
after a military coup in september and fled to areas controlled by 
rebel groups have returned to their homes a government spokesman 
said friday 
several thousand people who had participated in demonstrations 
demanding democracy went to rebelcontrolled zones near the border 
with thailand when gen saw maung seized power sept 18 and crushed 
the protests 
his government claims some of those who fled went to the rebels 
to receive military training and weapons the government urged all 
of them to return and said it would act only against those who had 
committed criminal offenses 
as of thursday 919 people most of them students have returned 
home government spokesman kyaw sann told a news briefing 
he denied reports that large numbers of people who took part in 
the antigovernment demonstrations had been imprisoned 
there are no political prisoners he said those detained 
are involved in violation of existing laws except for those who are 
involved in serious offenses most were released after 
interrogation 
kyaw sann was asked about demands by some political parties that 
the nightime curfew and the ban on public demonstrations be lifted 
he said the law and order situation has improved but not enough to 
remove those restrictions 
opposition parties also have called for the reinstatement of 
government employees fired by the military government 
kyaw sann said no action was taken against government workers 
for simply taking part in demonstrations action was taken only 
against those who exceeded the permissible regulations most of them 
were pensioned off and some dismissed he did not say how many 
workers had been fired

purdue university has complied with a 
government agencys request to hide its information about the virus 
program that jammed thousands of computers across the country last 
week a researcher said friday 
however such action isnt likely to prevent a determined 
computer hacker from wreaking havoc again said eugene h spafford 
an assistant professor and computer scientist at purdue said by 
phone from the campus in west lafayette 
the worry of the national computer security center and our 
worry is that if somebody gets even a significant portion of the 
source code then they could turn out something more dangerous 
spafford said 
since hundreds of copies of the errant program already are out 
spafford believes trying to control the information is a losing 
battle 
last thursday the worm program rapidly duplicated itself in 
computer systems nationwide spreading like a virus slowing the 
computers processing speeds and filling up their memories 
at purdue the worm entered a computer connected to internet an 
international computer network on which researchers from 
universities computer companies and some government installations 
share information and resources 
officials from the national computer security center a division 
of the national security agency contacted purdue this week and 
asked that worm data be removed from a file where others could have 
access to it 
the purdue file had copies of the worm program and somewhat 
disassembled somewhat reversecompiled versions of the code 
spafford said this could be used to understand how it worked but 
it wasnt in a form that could be used to contruct a new version 
he said the university did not consider the data potentially 
harmful but removed it in an attempt to be cooperative 
however people who run the thousands of computers affected by 
the virus believe they need to see the code so they can feel 
comfortable that no damage was actually done so they can be sure 
they plugged all the holes that could be exploited thats also a 
valid viewpoint spafford said 
one approach to resolving the problem might be to widely 
publicize the fixes without distributing the code then after a 
reasonably short period of time say three to six months release 
the code he said explaining that the process would give people 
plenty of time to construct defenses against the program

a prosecutor has filed sexual abuse 
charges against three roman catholic priests for allegedly molesting 
two brothers who were altar boys and accused the church of 
footdragging during the investigation 
it was not the spirit of cooperation we would like to see 
washington county district attorney john pettit said thursday 
calling it minimal at best 
pittsburgh bishop donald w wuerl denied the allegation saying 
i think the diocese has made every effort to be cooperative 
wuerl heads the catholic diocese of pittsburgh which oversees 
washington county 
pettit charged the rev richard f zula 47 former pastor at 
sts mary and ann church in marianna the rev robert wolk a former 
paster and diocesan assistant chancellor of st thomas more church 
in the pittsburgh suburb of bethel park and the rev francis pucci 
former pastor of immaculate conception church in washington all 
three men have been relieved of their pastoral duties 
in more than 150 counts pettit alleged that the priests sexually 
abused the two boys from 1981 to 1987 the homosexual acts allegedly 
took place in a barn a church basement a parked car and at a 
mountain resort 
pettit said investigators do not believe the three priests acted 
in concert although zula and pucci were charged with one count each 
of conspiracy because pucci allegedly knew of zulas intentions when 
he let zula use his bedroom at a parish home to have sex with one of 
the youths 
some of the incidents involved whips chains drugs and alcohol 
pettit said 
the alleged victims are brothers now ages 17 and 19 who were 
altar boys at st thomas more and moved from wolks parish to zulas 
in 1982 authorities said 
pettit said one of the priests whom he did not name may have 
been involved in similar incidents in allegheny and somerset 
counties and in florida ohio virginia and canada four other 
youths and an unidentified adult who is not a priest may also have 
been involved he said 
i dont want this to be misinterpreted as a witch hunt

high levels of explosive methane gas lingered 
underground friday hampering investigation of a sewer tunnel blast 
that killed three workers 
no one would enter the 2000foot tunnel until levels of methane 
a gas formed when organic materials decompose had dissipated said 
pat freeman safety director for the sa healy co 
we want it completely purged he said we still dont know 
what kind of reading youre going to get way up in the head 
investigators from the milwaukee county district attorneys 
office and the us occupational safety and health administration 
videotaped the site of thursdays blast but did not enter the tunnel 
healy co is looking for a contractor to drill a hole at the head 
of the tunnel which would allow the methane to escape and could 
speed up the process freeman said 
the investigators from the das office do want to get down as 
soon as we can get in he said methane levels should be low 
enough next week to allow investigators to enter the tunnel freeman 
said 
phillip van kuiken osha safety supervisor declined to discuss 
the investigation as did richard heath who was representing the 
district attorneys office at the scene officials are unsure what 
caused the blast 
the explosion ripped through the tunnel at about 9 am as the 
three workers carried monitoring equipment to check high levels of 
methane that forced workers to evacute 
rescue workers who had to clear explosive fumes and remove 
twisted wreckage while contending with poor lighting and kneedeep 
mud took eight hours to remove the bodies 
jim rezka project engineer said he would favor installing 
remotecontrolled methane monitoring equipment that would allow 
measurement of gas levels without workers having to enter the tunnel 
theres always a chance of human error he said thered be 
a lot to be said for a remotecontrolled monitoring system even 
though they were following a set procedure anything could have set 
off an explosion 
the dead were identified as ron kohne 49 tunnel superintendent 
from big sandy tenn tony bell 25 shift foreman from sturgeon 
bay and rick sochacki 34 of holland ill

hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage 
that spilled into a creek forced authorities to close seven miles of 
beach near marina del rey as a health hazard 
the spill discovered thursday afternoon was caused by blockage 
in a 45 inchdiameter pipe that carries raw waste to a treatment 
plant the sewage overflowed erupting through an opening that had 
been covered by a bolted plate and ran into ballona creek and down 
into santa monica bay 
were talking minimally hundreds of thousands of gallons 
possibly millions this is a biggie said anna sklar of the 
department of public works 
the blockage which workers were still trying to clear late 
friday may have been caused by failure of the brick lining of the 
decadesold sewer where it crosses under the creek she said 
this is one of the worst spills weve had it is also becoming 
too frequent said city councilman zev yaroslavsky who is 
expected to challenge mayor tom bradley for election next year 
we have a sewer system we are investing a lot of money in right 
now and our citizens are not getting their moneys worth he said 
im going to ask for an investigation on monday 
ms sklar said sewage mainly overflowed during the morning and 
evening peakusage periods and stopped in between 
the health department posted signs warning beachgoers to stay out 
of the water from the venice pier to grand avenue in el segundo and 
lifeguards said friday that most were heeding the warnings 
including youngsters out of school for veterans day 
there are tons of kids down here surfing but they arent in 
the contaminated area said capt steve voorhoos of the los 
angeles county lifeguards south bay headquarters he estimated 
crowds in the thousands 
were attempting to keep the kids out but some dont hesitate 
to go in all we can do is warn them 
despite sunshine and temperatures in the 70s few would have 
ventured into the chilly 59degree water anyway lifeguards said 
even wetsuitclad surfers moved into noncontaminated areas to enjoy 
the 3 foot waves 
at venice beach lifeguard lt randy degregori said you dont 
notice anything that you can see or smell we havent really had a 
problem there are lots of surfers here but they arent in the 
closed area 
the cause of the blockage was unknown but vandalism was a 
possibility because a sewer cover near the spot had been removed 
ms sklar said however it also could have been popped up by the 
force of the backup she said and authorities were still 
investigating 
its clear that because of the contamination that occurred at 
the beach that the line was blocked for several hours and maybe for 
a couple of days she said 
crews thought they had cleared the blockage but later the 
problem had returned and sewage was flowing into the creek again 
ms sklar said

independence marched from st johns cathedral in warsaws old 
town area to the tomb of the unknown soldier following a roman 
catholic mass at the church

10 were detained 
rallies were held in at least eight other cities gdansk 
krakow wroclaw lublin lodz poznan tarnow and katowice 
opposition activists said police battled demonstrators in gdansk 
poznan krakow tarnow and katowice 
they had few details on the clashes in tarnow which took place 
after a mass three people were taken to a hospital after being 
beaten by police in the southern industrial city of katowice said 
maria moczulska a spokeswoman for the illegal confederation for an 
independent poland 
in gdansk the baltic port city where the nowoutlawed solidarity 
union movement was born more than 25000 people attended a mass 
said opposition spokeswoman joanna wojciechowicz 
she said some of them tried to organize a march and police 
attacked with water cannon and clubs and arrested about 10 
demonstrators 
many people shouted lenin is yours the shipyard is ours 
she added 
the violence ended when bishop tadeusz goclawski appealed to the 
police commander to recall his officers and allow the crowd to 
disperse ms wojciechowicz said 
solidarity was founded at the lenin shipyard during strikes in 
august 1980 communist authorities announced this month that they 
will close the shipyard beginning dec 1 because it is losing money 
solidarity was suspended in december 1981 and outlawed the following 
year 
police in poznan battled about 4000 demonstrators and arrested 
scores of people according to a solidarity activist 
witnesses said about 10000 people participated in a rally in 
krakow and later groups of young people engaged in running street 
fights with police 
the official news agency pap reported aggressive protests in 
several cities and said in some cities demonstrations and 
attempts to disturb public order were undertaken by irresponsible 
groups of youth 
the warsaw demonstrators marched to the tomb of the unknown

opposition groups solidarity confederation for an independent 
poland the independent students association and the polish 
socialist party

the independence of poland is the concern of every generation 
authorities put on the most elaborate celebration ever under 
communist rule to mark the creation in 1918 of the capitalist 
antisoviet republic in poland between the two world wars it was 
the first time such lavish attention has been paid to polands 
interwar leader marshal jozef pilsudski 
on nov 11 1918 a civil council in warsaw turned over military 
power to pilsudski who had just been released from a german prison 
he proclaimed an independent polish state and disarmed the remaining 
german troops in the capital 
the reestablishment of poland after 123 years of being 
partitioned between prussia austria and russia fulfilled the dream 
of generations of patriots 
a catholic mass for the fatherland celebrated by the 
countrys chief military chaplain was televised friday one of the 
few such services ever shown on staterun tv outside of christmas 
and papal visits 
the celebrations sharply contrasted with treatment of the 
anniversary in the past private groups who tried to organize 
marches on the date every year after 1974 faced sharp repression 
in the western city of poznan a battle erupted between riot 
police and about 4000 demonstrators said solidarity activist 
alexandra bessert she said the fighting lasted about two hours and 
described police as unusually aggressive and brutal

embracing popular patriotic symbols and urging unity in the name of 
the ojczyzna or fatherland 
on the broad expanse of victory square polish communist party 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski wearing his army uniform and 
accompanied by prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski presided at

china and saudi arabia participants in a 
secret arms deal two years ago have reached agreement to open trade 
offices in each others capitals it was announced here friday night 
the two countries ambassadors to the united states saudi 
arabian prince bandar bin sultan and chinese envoy han xu signed a 
memorandum of understanding in washington on friday for setting up 
commercial representative offices said a chinese embassy 
statement 
the decision was reached with a view to further developing the 
friendly relations and cooperation between china and saudi arabia in 
the economic and commercial field embassy spokesman wu zurong 
said 
the decision to open trade offices followed disclosures this year 
that saudi arabia secretly purchased mediumrange missiles from 
china in 1986 the state department told congress last may that 
while saudi arabia refused to allow us inspection of the chinese 
missiles it assured the united states that the launchers would not 
be equipped with nuclear or chemical warheads and it backed this by 
signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
the opening of trade offices is often regarded in diplomacy as a 
symbol of thawing relations and a prelude to formal diplomatic 
relations between countries that do not recognize each other such 
as saudi arabia and the peoples republic of china 
saudi arabia is one of the largest countries in the world that 
has continued to recognize the rival chinese nationalist government 
in taiwan the policy was explained in the past as one of support 
for offshore taiwans staunch anticommunism and opposition to the 
official atheism of mainland china 
but in recent months taiwan newspapers have noted that the saudis 
and some other countries were drawing closer to beijing and they 
have speculated that those countries might switch their diplomatic 
recognition for its part taiwan has been relaxing restrictions 
against its citizens private contacts with the chinese mainland and 
expanding trade and other contacts with communist countries of the 
soviet bloc 
as of last january mainland china had formal relations with 135 
countries and taiwan only 23 the united states switched official 
recognition from taiwan to beijing in 1978 and maintains a broad 
range of relations with taiwan at a nonofficial level

observe a ceasefire during an organization of american states 
meeting in san salvador next week but an army commander rejected 
the rebels proposal 
we have decided to suspend the military campaign and declare a 
fiveday truce during the meeting said joaquin villalobos a 
leader of the farabundo marti national liberation front the 
umbrella organization of leftist salvadoran rebel groups

truce would run from 6 pm sunday to 6 pm friday he also said 
the rebels would respond if the army attacked 
secretary of state george p shultz is scheduled to attend the 
opening session of the oas conference monday

the rebels statement but col mauricio vargas speaking with 
reporters in el salvador called the guerrillas announcement 
cynical 
vargas is commander of the 3rd army brigade in the eastern 
province of san miguel where the guerrillas are most active 
they the guerrillas should not play with an entire peoples 
desire for pacification vargas said 
peace is not a momentary truce he added it should not be 
manipulated on the international stage to give the impression that a 
certain will exists where it does not in fact exist 
vargas said he would not suspend military operations in the 
eastern zone 
we have not entertained the idea of interrupting the 
fulfillment of our constitutional duty which is to combat those who 
are killing the people he said 
guerrillas have increased their attacks in san salvador capital 
of el salvador and security has been tightened around the city in 
recent weeks 
villalobos and leonel gonzalez another rebel leader expressed 
hope that presidentelect george bush would change us policy 
toward el salvador and condemned the military and economic policies 
of salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte 
gonzalez proposed talks with the salvadoran government before 
scheduled elections in march and said the rebels would set no 
preconditions

in october 1987 in san salvador the guerrillas have rejected the 
governments demands that they first lay down their arms

forces

albert furrer finally became the last 
man at the last mans club annual veterans day party on friday but 
he cant tell you how he outlived 31 buddies 
its a privilege to be honored by people just for sticking 
around all this time but you know i had to bury a lot of people 
along the way said the 96yearold san francisco native during 
the celebration 
god only knows how i made it he laughed while recuperating 
at brookside hospital where he had a malignant growth removed 
earlier this week i never abused myself but i didnt lead a holy 
life either 
furrer and the other san francisco bay area world war i veterans 
started the club as a sort of lark on what was then armistice day in 
1932 similar groups have been formed by veterans elsewhere 
the group met every year with the idea being that the last 
survivor was to get a bottle of mumms champagne as well as an 
endowment of cash made up of all those years of annual dues 
i came through floods fires wars and my god you come 
through it all and i dont know if its an honor or a sort of 
curse said furrer a former merchant and civic leader who lives 
in a nearby nursing home 
at a ceremony scheduled friday furrer received the champagne 
from the family of the clubs former secretarytreasurer victor 
parachini who died in february at the age of 89 for the past four 
years they had been the only two surviving members the bottle is 
signed by the clubs original 32 
but there is no cash left 
although the clubs coffers once held 30000 the club went 
broke five years ago after spending the money on the annual parties 
and helping care for several members who fell on bad times 
and after 56 years the champagne has soured a new bottle was 
popped as furrer officially declared an end to the club he sipped 
from a plastic glass and then smiled 
furrer says members never talked about the war during their 
annual parties because the experience in the trenches of europe was 
something few cared to recall 
furrer says he isnt sure hes glad to have outlived his buddies 
its rough to see all your friends die off he lamented 
old people dont make many new friends

in the latest fallout from californias 
insurance rateslashing proposition 103 two state senators 
threatened friday to press for multimilliondollar penalties for 
insurers who flee the state 
senate president pro tem david roberti and sen alan robbins also 
summoned top executives of seven companies they said had stopped 
selling auto or business liability policies to explain themselves at 
a legislative hearing 
roberti said the hearing and threatened legislation were needed 
to show the industry the state intends to carry out voters demands 
for insurance reform 
if theyre retaliating against the voters we will retaliate 
against them roberti a democrat said 
proposition 103 would roll back rates on nearly all property and 
casualty insurance policies to 1987 rates and then cut premiums an 
additional 20 percent 
industry spokesman joe annotti of the independent insurance 
agents and brokers of california said the senators threat had 
little effect in the face of a state supreme court stay on 
imposition of the ballot measure 
most of the many companies that indicated they might flee the 
state because of proposition 103 suspended that decision after the 
high court issued its stay thursday he said 
state attorney general john van de kamp will challenge the stay 
monday said spokesman alan ashby 
no matter how the legal battle turns out a law forcing insurers 
to stay in business incurring what they say will be monumental 
losses imposed by the proposition wont work said annotti 
you cant force companies to operate at a loss he said 
proposition 103 backed by consumer advocate ralph nader was 
approved by a slim margin in tuesdays election while four other 
insurance initiatives sponsored by the industry or by trial lawyers 
failed miserably 
those results together with the fact that proposition 103 had an 
advertising budget minuscule by comparison to the other measures 
amount to a voter mandate for reform said roberti and robbins 
the issue today is protecting the integrity of the ballot 
box robbins said calling the insurers response petulant 
the legislature is not in session but robbins democratic 
chairman of the senate insurance committee scheduled a hearing nov 
18 in los angeles to examine reported decisions by at least seven 
insurance companies either to stop writing liability coverage for 
drivers and businesses or to pull out of california entirely 
the chief executives of those companies are to be summoned to 
testify and subpoenaed if necessary robbins said 
john kozero spokesman for firemans fund in novato said his 
companys top executive was open to discuss insurance reform in any 
forum spokesmen for the four other companies reached by the 
associated press werent able to say if their chief executives would 
appear 
firemans fund which stopped writing new car insurance after the 
election had sound economic reasons he said 29 million in losses 
on auto policies last year 
its simple economics kozero said as far as personal auto 
insurance is concerned we have not made money in eight of the last 
10 years in california when you cant make money in normal 
circumstances you certainly cant make money under 103 
nader in a cbs interview friday belittled the insurer 
defections 
this is their usual bluster and boycott threats nader said 
what the insurance companies want us to forget is the last three 
or four years of overcharging i think that proposition 103 is 
simply a little law and order to make them behave 
sixtyseven insurers holding more than 75 percent of the states 
auto insurance policies indicated they would quit that part of the 
business after the election annotti said but most decided to hold 
off after the stay was issued he said

george bush owes nothing to the radical right 
or any other group except the voters for his victory and his 
personal triumph was at the same time a republican party defeat 
says richard nixon 
the partys weakness is vividly demonstrated by its record over 
the last eight years nixon wrote in the last of 12 political 
columns for the sunday times of london appearing this sunday 
when reagan was inaugurated in january 1981 the republicans 
had 53 senators and 192 congressmen he wrote after eight years 
of peace six years of prosperity an enormously popular president 
and two more landslide presidential victories the gop will have 45 
senators and 172 congressmen 
nixon says that reagan had the total support of the gop right 
wing in 1980 but that bush had only implacable opposition from the 
radical right bush owes nothing to them or indeed to any interest 
group except the biggest one the voters 
although the party has in the past stood for peace freedom 
national unity and national strength nixon said in the campaign 
just past the best argument the party seemed to be able to make 
for itself this year was that jimmy carter wasnt one of its 
cardcarrying members 
it is not enough just be antiliberal he wrote 
while bush won 41 in the electoral votes it has been largely 
overlooked that bushs margin in 11 states was three percent or less 
and a shift of only 535000 votes in these states would have 
elected dukakis he wrote included among the eleven are voterich 
illinois california and pennsylvania 
democratic party winners of the past franklin roosevelt harry 
truman john kennedy and lyndon johnson all were domesticpolicy 
liberals nixon said but all were credible conservatives on foreign 
policy on national defense 
dukakis weakness nixon writes was that unlike the democratic 
winners in the past he was perceived to be weak on defense and 
foreign policy

jurors in a murder trial began 
watching a videotape friday in which the defendant under hypnosis 
assumes the voice of satan and other personalities and describes 
killing his 19yearold daughter 
on the tape thomas lee bonneys voice took on a demonic snarl as 
he was interviewed under hypnosis by a psychiatrist 
youre just a mortal the chesapeake va man growled 
eyebrows arched long fingernails clicking on the tabletop you 
dont know nothing 
satan and three other of bonneys 10 purported personalities 
revealed themselves in 23 hours of videotaped interviews with dr 
paul f dell 
dell a psychiatry professor at norfolks eastern virginia 
medical school who was retained by the defense diagnosed bonney as 
having multiple personalities 
superior court judge paul m wright viewed potions of the tapes 
thursday and ruled they could be shown to the jury lawyers said the 
presentation of the tapes could last into next week 
bonney 45 is charged with the firstdegree murder of his 
19yearold daughter kathy carol bonney her body was found last 
november dumped next to the dismal swamp canal just inside north 
carolinas border with virginia 
she was nude and had been shot 27 times bonney who could 
receive the death penalty if convicted pleaded innocent by reason 
of insanity and unconciousness 
on the tape bonney assumed the feeble voice of mammy his 
longdead maternal grandmother and called out for kathy bonney 
can you hear me kathy mammy said im so old so old but 
i gotta fix supper maybe youll change your mind eat some supper 
now 
she aint supposed to be living in here satan interrupted 
referring to bonneys dead daughter she wont be in here long 
satan vowed she called me a bastard 
the gun went off she was sitting there screaming and i 
was hollerin and i said what are you gonna do and she said 
im gonna shoot you you bastard 
i know everything satan said i am strong i can do what i 
want to when i want to i control tom hes dumb a wimp a 
goodygoody talking that jesus garbage all the time 
suddenly viking spoke up a noble friendly personality and the 
first to reveal itself during bonneys evaluation by dell 
hes gonna shoot her viking screamed excitedly apparently 
reliving the night kathy bonney died hes gonna shoot her no 
no ive got to protect her dont shoot her i love her 
bonney seemed composed as he watched thursday he later was 
unsteady on his feet as he left the courthouse later asked what he 
thought of the tape bonney said it didnt look like me ive got 
more hair than that that wasnt me 
wrights decision to allow the tapes to be shown was the second 
victory in as many days for defense attorneys john w halstead jr 
and john s morrison 
on wednesday the judge excluded from evidence the most damaging 
of several incriminating statements bonney made to police about his 
daughters death that statement was prohibited because it was not 
made available to the defense until after testimony began in the 
fourweekold trial 
kathy bonney had argued with her father on the darkened roadside 
about a love letter to a married boyfriend whom satan called that 
stupid newt then according to the satan personality kathy 
bonney called him a bastard she sorta goofed when she called him 
that 
she thought she was talking to tom satan said but she was 
talking to me

a jury has awarded john morrell amp co 
246 million in damages from the meatpackers union for three 
strikes at its processing plant in sioux falls and the union has 
promised to appeal 
the award issued in us district court on thursday stemmed from 
a 40 million lawsuit the company filed claiming the oftenviolent 
strikes were illegal because the sioux falls union local had a labor 
contract in effect 
a previous federal jury agreed in march but a federal arbitrator 
ruled monday that 2400 union members were legally refusing to cross 
a picket line set up by striking morrell workers from sioux city 
iowa 
we will appeal it and we will win on appeal nick clark 
assistant general counsel for the united food amp commercial workers 
union said of the damage award 
us district judge richard battey had refused to let the union 
appeal the original finding that the strike was illegal until after 
the second trial to assess damages 
the cincinnatibased company maintained it suffered 265 million 
in losses because of the strikes in 1986 and 1987 witnesses for the 
union testified some of the losses were related to market 
conditions including a shortage of hogs and high livestock prices 
morrell also is fighting a 43 million fine the largest ever 
against a single employer by the occupational safety and health 
administration osha found the company did little or nothing in 
light of hundreds of serious injuries to hand and arm joints caused 
by the repetitive motion of the meatpacking line 
battey on thursday postponed enforcement of arbitrator william 
rentfros ruling that morrell must rehire workers who struck and pay 
them back wages the judge set court dates on nov 29 and dec 5 for 
morrell lawyers to file motions asking that the arbitrators ruling 
be nullified 
clark said the arbitrators finding which could allow an 
estimated 1900 union members to return to jobs they lost 19 months 
ago supports the unions claim that the strikes were legal 
it cuts the legs right out from under this verdict clark 
said 
george joseph an attorney for morrell said the arbitrators 
ruling should not affect the jurys verdict 
it is simply a decision of an arbitrator he said the 
jurys verdict is binding on all parties and i expect that that 
arbitrators decision will not be long for this world 
labor negotiations on a new pact continue in omaha between union 
and company officials the labor contract at the sioux falls morrell 
plant expires nov 20

efforts to smash chinas oncesacrosanct 
ironrice bowl system of lifetime employment are taking off in 
shenyang but a safety net is being woven to catch the growing 
legions of jobless 
this dreary northeastern industrial center chinas fourth 
largest city has become a laboratory for new programs to wean the 
communist nation from the inefficient system that guaranteed workers 
a job for life regardless of performance 
for example shenyang workers who lose their jobs now can receive 
training counseling and money from local offices believed to be the 
first unemployment centers in china 
city officials say the number of people receiving unemployment 
compensation will increase as shenyang intensifies its economic 
reforms by laying off about 300000 redundant workers or 15 
percent of the work force the citys population is 41 million 
the purpose of breaking the iron rice bowl is to develop 
productivity to increase the efficiency of our economy and also 
to quickly improve the peoples living standard explained xu 
qingyong a top official in the shenyang labor bureau 
since 1986 staterun companies in shenyang have paid 1 percent 
of their payrolls into a pioneering unemployment insurance fund that 
has been set up in only a few cities about 700 people have drawn a 
total of 10215 from the local fund according to dong lianzhi 
head of the citys unemployment insurance section 
the unemployed can draw on the fund for up to two years she said 
the average annual wage in chinas urban areas is about 270 
people who resign can collect 75 percent of their previous salary 
the first year and 50 percent the second fired employees can draw 
60 percent of salary for a year and then 50 percent 
the money is disbursed monthly at offices such as the huanggu 
district labor service co which is down a narrow alley in northern 
shenyang according to a large wall chart in the office the center 
received 65 unemployed workers in the first three quarters of 1988 
and handed out 1991 
li hongxing a 24yearold with fashionably long hair was one of 
the first workers to receive unemployment compensation from the 
office when he decided to quit his job at the post office in 
december 1986 
i didnt realize i could get the money li recalled at 
first i felt a little as though i was letting the country down 
but he added that without the grant life would have been pretty 
tough 
li received 1050 a month for five months before he found a new 
job as a salesman he since has opened a beauty salon and says he 
earns up to 108 a month and plans to start up a restaurant 
adapting to unemployment which the communist government for many 
years refused to acknowledge existed is difficult for workers 
officials said many of the people who come to the huanggu labor 
office for assistance are enrolled in political study a 
euphemism for pep talks on finding new jobs 
the official newspaper economic reference reported in september 
that about 60000 redundant workers already were laid off in 
shenyang with most taking early retirement extended maternity 
leaves or receiving newly created jobs 
xu said the citys unemployment rate is expected to grow from 
about 25 percent to 4 percent in three years as the work force is 
further streamlined 
xu conceeded that the superfluous workers cant understand why 
they are being stripped of their jobs but we dont say we are 
not giving you a new job 
authorities must persuade the workers of the importance of the 
new system he said 
even in a socialist country you should have a sense of 
competition you need to have competition xu added this is the 
way to develop the skills of the workers this is the only way that 
they can realize the contributions they can make

a rare glimpse of napoleon bonapartes military 
genius goes to the auction block later this month with the sale of a 
handwritten letter outlining secret plans to invade england 
written by napoleon on dec 7 1803 to adm ganteaume the 
letter details three different and daring strategies for maneuvering 
60 french ships across the english channel in one plan the idea 
was to trick the british into thinking the vessels were on their way 
to egypt 
let us be masters of the strait for six hours and we will be 
masters of the world napoleon wrote i dont have to tell you 
that secrecy is everything 
the objective was to cover his armys planned invasion from 
boulogne 
the first two plans outlined how napoleon wanted to assemble his 
fleets at various places for the final assault from boulogne in the 
third a fleet at rochefort was to leave for toulon and wait until 
an expedition left for egypt then the fleet would head for boulogne 
while a fleet at brest sailed for iceland in the north atlantic 
the third plan was the most complex because moving one fleet to 
toulon and sending another toward iceland was designed to trick 
britains lord nelson into heading for alexandria egypt while 
british land forces would be tied up protecting the countrys 
western coast against the fleet headed of iceland 
none of the plans was ever carried out the invasion fleet was 
repeatedly struck by storms and a major part of the fleet was 
engaged in a disastrous expedition to haiti in the caribbean 
the letter nevertheless is one of the highlights of the 
auction to be held nov 29 at the yearold drouotmontaigne auction 
house off the champs elysees in paris under the auspices of 
auctioneers aderpicardtajan 
also up for auction will be 50 pages of letters by the french 
novelist stendhal written while he was following napoleons armies 
in 181213 his account of the battle of bautzen we can see 
quite well from noon to three all that can be seen of a battle 
namely nothing would later inspire the famous account of the 
battle of waterloo in the charterhouse of parma 
in other letters stendhal describes the horror of the burning of 
moscow while complaining about his empty stomach and nagging 
toothache and the grossness of his compatriots 
on oct 4 1812 stendhal wrote to his sister we left the 
city illuminated by the most beautiful fire in the world the 
moon i believe shone above the fire it was a great spectacle but 
one had to be alone to see it this is the sad condition which 
ruined for me the russian campaign to have been with people who 
would have shrunken the coliseum and the sea of naples 
sure to delight history buffs and bibliophiles the auction also 
features rare first editions manuscripts and letters belonging to 
jacques guerin one of frances leading collectors and the man who 
defended the young marcel proust before remembrance of things 
past was universally acclaimed 
guerins collection includes works by dozens of french authors 
including an unusually rare and precious eightvolume edition of the 
works of moliere long considered the inventor of french high 
comedy bound in fine antique moroccan leather the books are one 
of four first editions of its kind and experts say they are in 
excellent condition 
the moliere edition dates from 1673 the year of his death and 
is thought to be a first attempt at a complete edition of his works 
previous sales in 1984 and 1986 of works from guerins extensive 
collection brought record prices said a spokesman for auctioneer 
jacques tajan 
there will be even more interest this time because of the 
beauty of the books and manuscripts their rareness and especially 
the spirit that runs through them tajan said 
other books from guerins collection include king louis xivs 
personal copy of racines esther written to celebrate the sun 
kings generosity the queens devotion and religious harmony in 
france under his reign 
the play appealed so much to louis xiv that he would attend 
rehearsals and follow the dialogue with his own gold and 
leatherbound copy of the text 
other works to be auctioned include an original manuscript of 
guillaume apollinaires famous le pont mirabeau and works by 
poets stephane mallarme paul verlaine and arthur rimbaud

where ugly coalslag heaps stood just 
a few years ago luxury homes now overlook two manmade lakes and 
green hillsides in this small vale of the rhondda valley once the 
heart of wales coalmining industry 
porth decorative products a local company that makes christmas 
ornaments plans to built a bigger factory on the other side of the 
water 
a site has been set aside for a school and an application to 
build a rugby field is awaiting the approval of local authorities 
clydach vale about 20 miles north of cardiff the welsh capital 
is an example of how things are changing in wales 
the last five years have been nothing short of dramatic said 
tony roberts deputy chief executive of the rhondda borough council 
peter walker the british governments welsh secretary said 
the valleys of the 1990s are going to be very much better nicer 
enjoyable lively and diverse than anything theyve had this 
century 
coal was found in the 1800s in the more than a dozen valleys 
spread over an area of about 860 square miles in south wales and 
turned the country into the energy capital of the world 
but its cruel legacy endures with its depressing scars 
welsh writer richard llewellyn poignantly warned of it in his 
1939 classic how green was my valley 
the late llewellyns main character a miners son called huw 
morgan says our valley was going black and the slag heap had 
grown so much it was halfway along to our house young i was and 
small i was but young or small i knew it was wrong and said so to 
my father 
today at the floor of the valleys lie the black remains of the 
coal pits and the winding gear with its wheels and pulleys you can 
still see the railway lines snaking along the abandoned colliery 
buildings rising upward on the steep hills are the remaining slag 
heaps their blackness visible through the grownover grass 
up the hillsides climb the coal workers sturdy terraced houses 
in inexorable rows many are run down and some still have outdoor 
toilets 
large numbers of the areas 700000 people remain unemployed 
the rhonddas jobless rate is 25 percent compared with the overall 
welsh rate of 103 percent largely because of the welsh coal 
industrys continuous decline for the last 60 years 
in 1920 more than 270000 workers were employed in hundreds of 
pits in the coal industry in south wales 
today after being especially hard hit by the recession of the 
early 1980s as well as a yearlong coal miners strike in 1984 
just 11 coal mines are left employing about 7500 workers 
the local peoples health still suffers from a poor diet and from 
having worked in the mines and tightly knit communities remain 
isolated exacerbating their problems 
but the transformation has indeed begun sparked by a complex 
combination of national government interventon local government 
initiatives and private enterprise 
walker the welsh secretary this past summer launched a new 
threeyear program estimated to cost more than 885 million to 
accelerate the revival 
the program aims to reduce unemployment by funding training 
offering grants to attract outside investment and giving assistance 
to new and smallbusiness men it also among other things is 
spending money to improve health services roads and public 
buildings the latter so that the valleys musical heritage can 
flourish 
already unemployment has decreased by 13000 people to 37000 
since january 1986 and in the past nine years some 350 
governmentfunded factories have been built 
about 2900 acres of derelict land have been reclaimed usable 
land has been particularly valuable in the steep valleys where it 
was scarce long before slag was dumped 
some of the slag heaps that were removed were found to contain 
combustible coal and that was sold 
so far in the 1980s 45000 homes have been improved and private 
builders have put up new ones 
new shops are opening up and the major brewers in the area 
whitbread and bass are spending millions of dollar refurbishing 
their pubs 
its going to be a success david waterstone chief executive 
of the welsh development agency said about the revival its the 
change of mood that is the most important thing once they want 
things to happen they happen

6200yard golf course designed by rogers two tennis courts an 
indoor basketball court and two lakes stocked with fish 
all my life ive participated in sports rogers said i 
love basketball and tennis and ive become obsessed with golf the 
last few years i play every day thats why i built the golf 
course and everybody is a young kid when you play sports 
so rogers began to formulate his idea 
we had just completed the course last july 1987 and i was not 
sure how good it was so i thought i would invite a couple of pro 
golfers to play here said rogers that was in march or april 
and the concept was born 
rogers said he then thought about tennis and john mcenroe came 
to mind and i knew he liked to play basketball thats when one 
thing just led to another we got the idea and so we said why 
not 
another factor he said was that the event could be used to 
raise money for charities which rogers is involved in yearround 
celebrities he said can attract a lot of attention with very 
little effort its almost selfish not to do it 
he said a percentage of the money raised through ticket sales 
would go to united cerebal palsy and the homeless of atlanta and 
athens ga 
im not sure how much well raise for charity this year but 
im sure we can generate a lot of money for charity from this event 
in future years he said adding he plans to hold the event 
annually 
the event which drew about 3000 spectators for the three days 
in cloudy rainy weather was the first time rogers had opened his 
farm to the public 
at first i didnt think i wanted a whole lot of folks as much 
as i love em all stomping around down there on the farm he 
said 
but we talked it over and decided what the heck let the 
people come see it theyll probably really enjoy it 
tournament chairman kelly jukerman said the first three players 
contacted were bird jordan and mcenroe 
each one said it sounded like a lot of fun and that theyd be 
there he said the next thing we knew was that we had four of 
the best basketball players in the world a bunch of great athletes 
and kenny going in with that abc bought it 
it was easy getting the entertainers kris and kenny are 
friends and kenny played tennis with jimmy caan several times in 
los angeles lamas is an athlete so when we put it together 
actually they were the easiest guys to get most actors would like 
to be athletes said jukerman 
they all stayed at the ranch and although they kind of knew 
each other they really didnt know each other i think a lot of 
friendships were made and everybody had fun he said 
kristofferson said he agreed to participate although i cant 
do any of the things theyre doing because charity would benefit 
we all had fun said rogers

teenagers patrick lovelady and jeff hoagland joked 
about the possibility of a plane crash as their jetliner was being 
deiced before takeoff during a snowstorm at stapleton international 
airport 
i hope we dont crash because no one ever lives through it 
hoagland said a year ago tuesday 
death would spare the two youths from melba idaho but many 
others aboard continental flight 1713 would not be so lucky 
the dc9 bound for boise idaho crashed on takeoff killing 28 
of the 82 people on board a national transportation safety board 
inquiry led to findings that blamed ice on the wings and the 
captains failure to order a second deicing before takeoff 
continental airlines continues to challenge the ntsb conclusions 
the carrier argues that the crash was caused by swirling winds 
created by a boeing 767 jumbo jet that landed three minutes before 
flight 1713s takeoff from a parallel runway 
cockpit recordings and testimony during the investigation give 
this account of what happened during the final minutes of flight 
1713 
as the jetliner moved away from the deicing pad capt frank 
zvonek 43 and copilot lee bruecher 26 were unaware that the 
control tower had lost track of them they would not begin their 
takeoff roll for 27 minutes as heavy snow fell 
bruecher who had recently come to continental from the commuter 
airline ranks was at the controls of the dc910 zvonek got flight 
1713s position straightened out with the tower and the aircraft was 
cleared for takeoff 
zvonek cautioned bruecher dont slide 
flight 1713 began to taxi down the runway and seconds later it 
climbed into the sky 
positive rate zvonek said six seconds after takeoff 
indicating the jet was gaining proper speed and altitude 
three seconds later came a noise thought to be an engine 
compression stall caused by interrupted air flow to the engine 
sometimes occurring during a too steep takeoff then a curse from 
bruecher then a series of loud bangs and compression stall noises 
zvonek grabbed the controls to try to save the careening plane 
navy lt curtis renfro was on a plane landing on a parallel 
runway the last time i saw it flight 1713 it was grossly 
tilted he was actually up on his starboard wing when that happens 
the pilot tries to flip to the left to correct he may have 
overcompensated renfro said 
the jetliner caught a wingtip and cartwheeled into the runway 
snapping off the nose and cockpit section zvonek and bruecher were 
killed the plane then flipped over on its back and skidded off the 
runway through snow and mud 
fiftyfour people survived some trapped upside down in their 
seats for six hours a flurry of lawsuits followed and many are 
scheduled to begin trial in denver us district court on dec 5 
within a month of the crash the federal aviation administration 
issued a memo strongly urging airlines whenever feasible not to 
mix two inexperienced pilots in a crew said faa spokesman fred 
farrar in washington 
the dc9 experience of zvonek and bruecher was examined during 
ntsb hearings in denver last march 
zvonek a former navy pilot and flight instructor had about 
12000 hours of flying time including experience flying large 
jetliners he had been rated to fly the dc9 seven months before the 
crash and had 133 hours on that type of aircraft with 33 hours as a 
dc9 captain 
bruecher had 3200 hours of flying time 36 in a dc9 including 
training flights his total commercial flight time in dc9s was 11 
hours 
it was also brought out that bruecher had been fired by able 
aviation of houston in 1985 for failing flight tests 
the ntsb report said ables flight instructor recalled that 
bruecher had a chronic problem of stepping on the wrong rudder 
becoming disoriented and described bruecher as tense and unable to 
cope with deviations from the routine 
bruecher flew turboprop planes two years for rio airways of 
killeen texas until hired by continental in july 1987 continental 
said background checks did not reveal bruechers dismissal by able 
the ntsbs final report in late september laid part of the blame 
for the crash on the captains failure to have the jetliner deiced 
a second time after the plane sat in steady snowfall for 27 minutes 
the ntsb also cited the inexperience of the captain and his copilot 
in flying dc9s and the heavy traffic conditions at the airport as 
contributing factors 
the ntsb reports also said bruecher lifted the nose of the plane 
off the runway at too sharp an angle adding to the problems the 
plane already faced in gaining lift because of ice on the wings 
as a result of the flight 1713 crash the ntsb has recommended 
that the faa require intensifed deicing procedures for the dc910 
series aircraft which do not have leading edge slats on their wings 
for additional lift said the safety boards ted lopatkiewicz in 
washington dc 
the ntsb also recommended the faa revise its rules on minimum 
cockpit experience to prohibit the pairing on the same flight of 
pilots who have less than the minimum experience in their respective 
positions lopatkiewicz said 
were not talking about changing minimum experience levels but 
minimum experience levels to be paired with another inexperienced 
crew member he said 
the faa is expected to respond to the ntsb recommendations by 
early feburary 
lewis jordan continentals chief operating officer said his 
carrier has launched a program to prevent pilots with under 100 
hours in a particular aircraft type from being paired in the same 
cockpit 
i believe youll find continental is the only airline that has 
done that jordan said 
continentals chief pilot is required to track all of its 
pilots with less than 100 hours in certain aircraft types jordan 
said the pilots themselves are honorbound to report whether their 
experience level falls below this threshhold 
the data is put in a computer program to flag any potential 
pairing of a captain and a first officer who have low time in a 
particular aircraft he said 
jordan said the former employers of pilot applicants cannot be 
forced to release personnel information but noted that continental 
training designed to help pilots overcome weaknesses or weed them 
out exceeds federal requirements 
since the crash continental pilots have been instructed to 
request takeoff delays if a large jetliner is landing on a parallel 
runway jordan is convinced that with denvers close parallel 
runways swirling winds called wing vortex played a major role in 
the crash 
we are quite disappointed that the ntsb stopped short of 
investigating that as thoroughly as we think they must said 
jordan who called flight 1713s crew highly professional and 
innocent pilots

federal watchdogs are hoping to scare away 
potential fraud mismanagement and other problems now plaguing the 
beleaguered thrift industry by revamping their system for examining 
savings and loans 
but whether their bite will turn out to be worse than their bark 
remains to be seen 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the nations 
3200 federally insured sampls has failed to prevent the problems 
that have sent the industry into the financial dog house 
right now about a quarter of all sampls are considered at or near 
insolvency and analysts estimate it could cost as much as 100 
billion to liquidate them 
still it hasnt been all the bank boards fault budgetary 
restraints forced the government to cut back on the number of thrift 
examiners needed to comb through financial books and detect 
potential problems the remaining examiners there were only 700 as 
recently as two years ago found themselves underpaid overworked 
and with little guidance 
the bank board hopes to start changing things around by 
overhauling the examination process through a new guidebook a sort 
of bible for evaluating savings and loans now being issued to its 
1500 examiners in 12 districts nationwide 
the handbook represents the first major revision of evaluation 
methods in seven years and draws upon examination procedures already 
being used by the federal reserve board comptroller of the currency 
and federal deposit insurance corp 
its goal is to detect problems earlier than in the past thus 
reducing the number of future thrift failures and the drain on the 
already burdened federal savings and loan insurance corp 
bank board spokesman paul lockwood explained some of the 
revisions 
changing priorities the new book takes a topdown approach 
to examinations focusing on overall policies and procedures of an 
institution rather than its individual loans the old book used a 
bottomup approach beginning with individual loans 
safety first examiners are encouraged to begin enforcement 
actions against institutions acting imprudently even if its actions 
are permissible the old book focuses on whether an institution 
complied with specific regulations 
the whole idea is to make management more accountable for what 
goes on lockwood said 
speaking english while the old book permitted examiners to 
write their reports in technical language the new one urges they 
become more understandable to their audience a companys board of 
directors 
the regulators have been so darn busy over the last three or 
four years that they really didnt have the resources to keep the 
old book up to date said lockwood as a result each of 
the 12 regions of the country headed by a home loan bank was left to 
devise their own procedures and standards 
obviously some did a better job than others 
in addition to the new handbook the bank board has beefed up its 
examiners staff raised salaries and provided retraining courses 
a few critics will argue that an overhaul of the examination 
process now is a bit like locking the barn door after the horses 
have fled 
theres a real fundamental problem with the whole evaluation 
process said bert ely a alexandria va consultant im not 
sure it needs more manpower the trick is to use the numbers to let 
you know when to go in and take a closer look 
they need to be relying on their computers to monitor and 
evaluate frequently reported data like a financial ekg monitoring 
ups and downs 
still others praise the bank boards effort as a step in the 
right direction 
i think the critics are missing the point said r dan 
brumbaugh jr a san francisco consultant and former deputy chief 
economist for the bank board its clear that no examiner handbook 
or any changing strategy will resurrect the insolvent institutions 
but we still have approximately 2100 that are solvent 
weve got to learn from the problems of the past and im 
certain the bank board has ample examples from which to draw upon

in small towns across america fall friday 
nights are traditionally reserved for football fever but in a 
remote rural corner of mississippi two gridirons are kneedeep in 
pale yellowing grass 
no bands have strutted no cheerleaders have cheered no burly 
helmeted youths have raced up and down bright stripes of green and 
white this autumn the 1988 liberty high bobcats and gloster high 
hornets never took the field 
angry black parents protesting appointment of a white principal 
at gloster high school all but shut the county school system 
earlier this fall ending the season before it even began 
the boycott was especially effective because in amite county 
population 12000 blacks comprise 80 percent of public school 
students most white families as in other southern states send 
their kids to private segregation academies indeed part of the 
objection to the new principal is that he sends his children to an 
allwhite private school 
those white schools are having their football season and its 
sad especially for the children that we arent having ours 
clarence mcdowell libertys principal said recently as he surveyed 
the forlorn football field and delapidated pile of wooden bleachers 
euphemistically known as bobcat stadium 
mcdowell a short softspoken man stared silently at the field 
for another moment and added the school superintendent canceled 
football here at liberty and over at gloster high because of the 
boycotts it didnt have to happen but neither side would give 
the two sides in question are the amite county school system 
headed by superintendent maurice foreman and the concerned citizens 
for better education committee a group of black parents led by jc 
patterson whose two children and three stepchildren attend public 
schools in liberty 
the concerned citizens coalesced after foreman announced that 
robbie robertson the white assistant principal at gloster high 
would succeed glosters retiring black principal this fall 
robertsons children attend a private allwhite academy just over 
the line in neighboring wilkinson county 
its bad enough that they passed over qualified black 
applicants to hire him said patterson a 39yearold farmer and 
construction worker but we just arent going to allow them to 
push us out and put in a man who thinks his children are too good to 
attend public schools 
the citizens committee initially staged a twoweek boycott 
against the white merchants of gloster and liberty populations 
1200 and 700 
liberty mayor gerald miller acknowledged the boycotts hurt 
business the economic conditions around here are not that great 
were dependent upon oil and timber so we need everybody to ptich 
in and support the county he said 
when classes began aug 27 the boycott shifted to the countys 
four public schools two elementary and two high schools black 
children were taught in makeshift classroooms set up in churches 
gloster high with 350 students was completely shut down at 
liberty with an enrollment of 600 only 50 students mostly whites 
attended class 
we called off the boycott at the beginning of october after 
the justice department agreed to investigate patterson said 
right now were waiting to see what happens investigators have 
visited several times but justice has yet to release a report or 
make recommendations 
patterson said robertsons ouster is not the groups only demand 
the parents also want better courses more black administrators new 
schoolbooks and improved facilities 
the books are a crime patterson said many of them are 
outdated and were discards from other counties he said liberty 
high was a dump and a rat trap 
this falls walkout was the second major school boycott in amite 
county 
in 1977 after the first boycott the system was placed under 
federal court order to cease segregating students by sex and to 
follow various racial guidelines one being that there would be at 
least two black principals 
but the order was dropped in 1984 after school officials said 
theyd met guidelines and the schools have gone downhill ever 
since patterson asserted now of the 10 administrators in the 
county system only one clarence mcdowell is black and hes 
thinking about retiring because he gets no support from maurice 
foreman the white superintendent 
then too he added foreman keeps hiring white teachers 
including people who send their children to private schools and on 
top of that our childrens test scores have been dropping every 
year 
foreman acknowledged pattersons claims but said hed hired white 
teachers to try to attract white students but even with these 
hirings whites still make up only 33 percent of the employees in 
our school system he said he said more than 60 percent of amite 
county teachers are black 
foreman who is elected also admitted high school test scores 
are weak its true that were way below the national act 
average he said and 20 percent of the 11th graders failed the 
state literacy test last year but he blamed what he called the 
private school crowd 
this was last county in america to operate a public school 
system that had boys and girls going to separate schools he said 
we lost a lot of whites in 1970 when we had to integrate and 
lost a lot more in 1977 when we were ordered to drop the separate 
sexes plan installed in 1971 
until recently he said the county board of supervisors 
was dominated by the private school crowd they wouldnt give me 
anything but the bare minimum tax millage to run the schools 
since the law governing control of county budgets was changed two 
years ago he said funding has improved 
were starting to make progress he said weve got a new 
votech school and our elementary schools are in good shape what we 
need now is a new consolidated high school it doesnt make 
good sense to operate two small high schools 20 miles apart 
the dispute has stirred racial feelings but neither side 
welcomed a march through liberty by a band of white supremacists on 
oct 15 their leader nationalist movement founder richard barrett 
of jackson said they supported robbie robertson robertson 
however said he wanted no such champions 
i didnt ask for their support he said i dont know them 
and i want nothing to do with them 
in an interview in his high school office robertson acknowledged 
the problems caused when he was chosen from among three black and 
four white candidates 
this puts me in an uncomfortable position robertson said 
the blacks didnt want a white principal it made them mad when i 
was appointed and then they used the fact that i send my children 
to private schools as an excuse to stage their boycotts 
when asked why he chose not to patronize the public schools he 
replied i just dont care to say 
robertson said hed experienced much less friction at school from 
students than he had expected patterson however said about 100 
students almost a third of glosters enrollment had transferred 
after the boycott to liberty high where mcdowell is the countys 
sole black principal 
meanwhile there is little joy in amite county on friday nights 
we should be getting ready for our big game with gloster our 
arch rival mcdowell said but therell be nothing but rabbits 
and wild turkeys on the field that night and it hurts

vietnams plan to remove its forces from 
cambodia has touched off a flurry of diplomatic moves to spare that 
country the return to power of what is widely regarded as one of 
historys most genocidal regimes the khmer rouge 
according to diplomats and private experts there is little 
reason to suspect that the khmer rouge has changed much since the 
197578 period when it killed between 1 million and 2 million 
cambodians 
even if the lower figured is accepted it meant the death of one 
cambodian every two minutes during the three and a half years in 
which the khmer rouge sought to eradicate virtually overnight all 
vestiges of capitalism and to create an exclusively 
agriculturebased society 
the khmer rouge now operating as a large and highly disciplined 
guerrilla group has been projecting an image of moderation lately 
admitting that mistakes were made in the past and proclaiming that 
the movement is now guided by the principals of liberal 
capitalism 
this claim has been received with almost universal skepticism by 
experts on cambodia 
sams kibria the united nations coordinator for humanitarian 
assistance to cambodia has said that about 7000 cambodian refugees 
who were living under khmer rouge control in camps along the 
thaicambodian border disappeared earlier this year 
kibrias allegation was supported by tony jackson the cambodian 
policy adviser for oxfam the international relief agency based in 
britain 
officials at the united nations which provides humanitarian aid 
to the more than 300000 cambodian refugees stationed at the thai 
border camps said they believe the 7000 cambodians alleged to have 
disappeared were marched into the cambodian interior transporting 
arms to the khmer rouge 
about 70000 cambodian refugees live in khmer rougecontrolled 
camps but their fate is largely unknown the guerrillas generally 
refuse access to outsiders 
the reagan administration envisions a leading political role 
after the vietnamese withdrawal for prince norodom sihanouk who was 
cambodian head of state until his ouster in a 1970 coup 
sihanouk has said that one has to be either naive or an idiot 
to believe that the khmer rouge of the 1980s can be different from 
the khmer rouge of the 1970s much of the earlier leadership 
including khmer rouge chieftain pol pot continues to run the 
movement from clandestine camps 
sihanouk heads one of two noncommunist resistance forces in 
cambodia which is fighting the vietnamesebacked government the 
other is led by former prime minister son sann the two groups have 
an estimated 10000 troops each and receive nonlethal aid from the 
united states 
but the khmer rouge is considered by far the most potent of the 
rebel forces heightening concern among the united states and other 
interested parties about a return to power by that group 
partially as the result of khmer rouge military pressure vietnam 
has committed itself to the withdrawal of 50000 forces by the end 
of this year and its remaining troops estimated at about 70000 by 
1990 
the vietnamese announcement was greeted with relief by much of 
the international community which has applied strong diplomatic 
pressure on hanoi to end its military occupation of cambodia 
at the same time the possibility that the khmer rouge could fill 
the power vacuum created by the vietnamese withdrawal set off alarm 
bells in foreign ministries on several continents 
lately the state department has been increasingly vocal about 
the importance of a political settlement in cambodia that prevents 
the khmer rouge from assuming the dominant role in cambodia once the 
vietnamese leave 
the un general assembly recently approved its annual resolution 
calling for a vietnamese withdrawal but for the first time in a 
clear reference to the khmer rouge it also said cambodia must not 
return to the universally condemned policies and practices of the 
recent past 
the cambodian conflict has found china and the soviet union on 
opposite sides 
the principal backers of the khmer rouge have been the chinese 
who see the extension of vietnamese power into cambodia as a threat 
to national security for years reduction of soviet influence 
nearby either directly or through their main southeast asian ally 
vietnam has been a hallmark of chinese foreign policy 
under heavy international pressure china has backed away 
somewhat from its allout support of the khmer rouge effort to drive 
out the vietnamese invaders 
the chinese recognize their support for the khmer rouge is a 
liability internationally said one us official 
according to us government experts the chinese also may be 
temporizing their support out of concern that a khmer rouge triumph 
could induce the vietnamese to reinvade cambodia 
meanwhile the united states and its friends in the association 
of southeast asian nations asean have been discussing strategies 
for preventing a khmer rouge takeover 
among the possibilities discussed are the formation of an 
international peacekeeping force for cambodia or the disarming of 
the various armed factions 
until hanois announcement of its intention to withdraw the 
khmer rouge component of the cambodian problem was given secondary 
priority by the administration now both aspects of the problem are 
being given equal billing 
deputy assistant secretary of state david lambertson has told 
congress that the administration is unalterably opposed to the 
khmer rouge whose legacy of brutality and depravity is unsurpassed 
we are committed to a settlement in cambodia that contains 
safeguards to ensure that the khmer rouge can never again take 
control of cambodia and subject the cambodian people once again to 
the horrors of the past 
still some in congress believe the administration remained 
silent too long on the khmer rouge 
sen mark hatfield rore cosponsor of a resolution critical 
of both the khmer rouge and the vietnamese occupation assailed the 
selfimposed silence of the american government in dealing with 
the revival of the khmer rouge 
because of this policy the khmer rouge was nursed back to 
health by communist china and are poised to return to their old ways 
of torturing and terrorizing the people of cambodia hatfield said 
with us backing the united nations has refused to recognize 
the legitimacy of the current government in phnom penh and instead 
recognizes what amounts to a cambodian coalition government in 
exile a fragile union made up of the khmer rouge and the two 
noncommunist rebel factions but the permanent representative of 
cambodia at the united nations is a khmer rouge member 
the administration also expressed forceful opposition to a clause 
in the congressional resolution on cambodia which demanded an 
immediate halt to outside support for the khmer rouge 
the state department said that phrasing would be rejected by 
chin it successfully lobbied for the removal of the offending word 
some members of congress were aghast at this concession by the 
administration to the khmer rouge but relented out of concern that a 
protracted battle could mean the entire resolution would have to be 
shelved 
president reagan signed the resolution during the waning days of 
the recently adjourned congress 
if vietnam keeps its promise to withdraw officials say us 
policy toward southeast asia may become a major issue for the 
incoming bush administration as it tries to contend with a 
discredited group which for now is casting the longest shadow over 
postvietnam cambodia

a tiny woman dressed in black and stooped with age 
dropped to her knees and gingerly began to crawl up the 26 holy 
stairs in rome she paused at each step to pray or to kiss the 
crucifix of her rosary after touching it to a spot where christs 
blood supposedly fell 
the stairs which are across the street from romes st john 
lateran church are among hundreds of relics and venerated objects 
in italy linked to jesus or saints that have inspired the faithful 
for centuries 
but these relics have come under new scrutiny in the italian 
media since the roman catholic church announced in october that 
scientists had determined the shroud of turin perhaps the most 
famous of all cannot be the burial cloth of christ as many believed 
there is no proof only tradition to support claims the marble 
steps brought to rome once ascended to pilates palace in jerusalem 
and that jesus bleeding from roman whips tread on them 
still the old womans painful climb up the crowded stairs 
underscores that for many roman catholics such objects are a 
cherished link and that the church can consider religious symbolism 
more important than questions of authenticity 
relics are the means the physical mean of rediscovering or 
keeping in touch with the history of the faith said monsignor 
robert sarno an official with the vaticans congregation for the 
causes of saints 
it is a means of strengthening ones faith which in essence is 
a closer relationship with god 
after carbon14 tests showed that medieval weavers made the cloth 
in the holy shroud italian newspapers noted the same method could 
date what are believed by many to be fragments from the cross on 
which christ died thorns from christs crown or blood of st 
januarius of naples 
the newspapers noted that about 70 sanctuaries around the world 
claim to have drops of milk from the virgin marys breast while 
innumerable others lay claim to fragments of the cross or the hair 
fingernails or tears of jesus and that there are at least 30 
genuine nails from the crucifixion 
church officials say it does not expect a witch hunt for 
false relics or a purge of reliquaries 
sarno said however he sees no reason the church would not agree 
to such scientific tests on relics if the authenticity was seriously 
questioned 
we have to rid ourselves of the idea that the church is afraid 
of science there can be no contradiction between faith and science 
faith and science both come from god he said 
scientists and others outside the church have long been intrigued 
by the origin of the shroud of turins faint haunting image of a 
man who appeared to have been whipped speared crucified and 
crowned with thorns 
although some revered it as the actual burial cloth of jesus the 
church never recognized it as a relic instead it was considered a 
cherished object one treated with respect because it could be 
linked to christ 
cardinal anastasio ballestrero who as archbishop of turin is 
caretaker of the shroud said in october he had no reason to doubt 
carbon14 tests that indicate the cloth was made between the years 
1260 and 1390 
but he said the shroud remained a powerful symbol ballestrero 
and other church officials point out that the other scientists 
determined that the shroud was not the work of an artist and since 
the mystery of the creation of its image perists church officials 
do not rule out it could still be the work of god 
the point ballestrero and others seek to make is that the 
spiritual value to people like the devout old woman struggling on 
the stairs in rome can outweigh historical questions about objects 
such as the shroud the steps fragments of the cross and the 
myriads of saintly relics 
still sarno emphasizes that historical verification of relics is 
a necessity 
a relic is an authentic verifiable piece of history which has 
theological significance and spiritual meaning for the individual 
faithful he said 
it refers to the mysteries of faith and the purpose is to 
arouse strengthen and increase the faith of an individual who uses 
that object to reach the lord 
he notes that the church condemns idolotry and that the 
church frowns on the idea that a relic can serve as something other 
than an instrument to strengthen the faith 
in naples the faithful crowd into the cathedral twice a year to 
wait for what they believe is the dried blood of st januarius the 
citys patron saint to liquify the substance almost always 
liquifies on sept 19 marking the day the saint was beheaded for 
his faith in the year 305 and on the saturday before the first 
sunday in may 
neapolitans believe the liquification means good fortune for the 
city or even for its beloved soccer team the failure of the blood 
in two glass ampules to liquify is seen as a bad sign 
the vatican does not classify the liquification as a miracle and 
generally disapproves of its use as an omen

as the presidential campaign entered its last 
two weeks democratic party chairman paul kirk declared at a news 
conference that the american people know this election belongs to 
them not to roger ailes 
true or false it was telling evidence of the pervasive influence 
exerted by the man who shaped presidentelect george bushs kinder 
gentler media image and orchestrated slashing attack commercials 
against democrat michael dukakis 
the task was basic tear down dukakis and build up bush and 
experts agree the execution was brilliant but on the morning 
after some are concerned about the legacy left by the relentless 
attack strategy 
the bush campaign has been rewarded with the white house for 
the most negative broadcast campaign in the last 30 years said 
kathleen hall jamieson a political communications expert at the 
university of texas 
the lesson is clear added larry sabato an elections 
specialist at the university of virginia negative ads work use 
them 
the two academics said a greater proportion of the candidates 
advertising was negative and the attack spots were on the air for 
longer than ever before in a presidential campaign 
candidates dont bother with the positive phase anymore 
sabato said they never go completely positive either at the 
beginning or the end 
bushs ads reflecting his campaign themes and news coverage 
lashed out at the massachusetts governor on everything from 
pollution in boston harbor and problems in a state prison furlough 
program to dukakis stands on defense and the death penalty 
jamieson said voter savvy news coverage and opponent 
counterattacks generally are sufficient to check the impact of 
false distorted or misleading political advertising 
this year has made it very clear that the existing protections 
only work if the other side is equally competent in its use of 
advertising and debates and if the press does its job very very 
well she said dukakis didnt respond in ads he didnt respond 
in debates this year until the last two and a half weeks the 
press was expected to do it alone and the press alone cant do it 
dozens of media professionals offered reams of advice to dukakis 
over the course of his campaign early in the game several 
suggested that he might capitalize on positive curiosity by 
starting his tv campaign right after the convention in july he 
waited until september consequently losing a chance to define 
himself before the bush onslaught 
others pleaded with dukakis to take a dramatic step to seize 
control of the campaign agenda in the second debate for example 
ask bush to agree to a moratorium on negative ads or challenge him 
to a weekly mantoman debate until the election he didnt and by 
virtually all accounts lost the debate 
most advertising ideas never made it as far as film or videotape 
hundreds of scripts were received and hundreds were shelved and 
unlike ailes an innercircle strategist for bush from the outset 
no democratic media expert was let into the dukakis loop 
we were in another room we werent working together said 
theodore voss a new york advertising consultant who helped recruit 
talent for the campaign furthermore the ad department was ruled by 
a group of highlevel campaign officials that one insider likened to 
a jury needing a 120 vote to make any decision 
in short dukakis sorely needed a roger ailes 
the thing that was wrong was not having a strong advertising 
director to set direction to motivate and to say yes or no voss 
said theres no question in my mind that the ads could have been 
superb had there been better organization 
hoping to break through the inertia and bureaucracy the 
sawyermiller group in new york took to writing producing and 
paying for dukakis spots on its own on the chance they might be used 
the tactic worked in some instances but the group struck out 
with what might have been a key environmental ad a hardhitting 
lightningfast response to bushs famous boston harbor attack ad 
that was finished and shipped the same day the bush spot first 
aired it was never used 
when the national dukakis campaign finally went negative it 
focused for a long time on the dan quayle veep selection and the 
packaging of george bush neither message had the gutlevel 
appeal of crime or militarism or patriotism or clean water the hot 
buttons pushed so skillfully by bush and ailes 
ailes had a few things going for him in addition to the 
ineptitude of the dukakis ad campaign republicans and some 
democrats cite peace prosperity and other successes of the reagan 
years scott miller of sawyermiller said bushs unformed public 
image was another advantage 
what roger had to work with was an advertising mans dream a 
product without a label on it that he could define and shape pretty 
much the way he wanted he said i dont believe theres another 
such candidate on the national scene in either party 
kirk and others have denounced ailes as the dark genius behind 
bushs airwaves assault but miller defended his gop compatriot and 
said the ultimate responsibility for questionable bush tactics lies 
with bush 
its not up to roger ailes to make the decision that hes 
asking the candidate to say things that contradict his values or 
positions or ethics its up to the candidate to say thats not me 
or i wont do that miller said roger did what he was paid to 
do and he did an excellent job

a reggae version of cat stevens wild world 
it wasnt maxi priests idea 
i never wanted to do it it was the choice of the record 
company admitted priest who nonetheless went no 1 for four 
weeks with the song on the british singles chart 
all the way from london to jamaica i was saying i dont want 
to do this i dont like this record he said adding i enjoy 
the song now 
though only 25 priest is already a veteran in the music 
business wild world is included on maxi his third album 
and the first to be released in the united states 
he grew up in southeast london the son of a factory worker and 
described his upbringing as a bit too strict priest did 
however have a diverse musical background 
coming from the pentacostal church i liked a lot of religious 
songs having a jamaican west indian background i was into reggae 
his influences were broad ranging from the sounds of studio one 
in jamaica to the beatles although not a born musician he does 
not play an instrument priest was singing roughly from the time 
the doctor slapped my bum when i came out he created his own 
studio at the age of 14 
he was still a teenager when he joined saxon international as a 
deejay for sound system and worked with noted english reggae 
stars such as smiley culture and tippa irie 
i found myself getting a lot of ideas very quickly a lot of my 
vibes came from sound system you just start singing and things come 
out i found myself getting good melodies and good lyrics at the 
same time he said 
in 1984 priests debut single hey little girl became the 
first british reggae record to reach no 1 in jamaica the following 
year he released his first album youre safe and after 
extensive touring was named best male vocalist in the 1986 uk 
reggae awards 
his second album intentions came out in late 1986 and 
contained a cover version of van morrisons crazy love 
it was given to me by my manager i like van morrisons stuff 
i think hes a very good writer 
on maxi priest covers some guys have all the luck a hit 
for rod stewart 
it was a song that i always wanted to do it always used to 
work with me on stage once i was doing this tv program there was a 
commercial break and i started to sing the song and the crowd went 
yeah 
but priest writes most of his own material 
i dont want to be cut out as a cover artist im not putting 
it down it was a good idea and it worked but i do not want to be 
known as a cover artist 
i think most of my music comes from the early studio one where 
you had to have a good song a good melody 
priest is especially proud of how can we ease the pain an 
original song on maxi 
it means a lot to me its not being too political but its 
stating something the whole world need to understand that we could 
live a lot better than were living i dont like to get into any 
heavy politics but its just a nice way to say something 
he does deal more directly with politics on marcus a tribute 
to the late black nationalist leader marcus garvey 
its giving thanks to somebody that thought of the apartheid 
movement many years ago 
reggaes most famous rhythm section drummer sly dunbar and 
bassist robbie shakespeare played on maxi 
they heard a lot about me in england and i always heard about 
them it was inevitable somehwhere along the line priest said 
it was fun like sitting back and saying hey this is sly and 
robbie 
priest will begin a tour of the united states this fall he feels 
at ease performing live crediting his confidence to the time spent 
at saxon international 
you have to sing with people right into your face so i had a 
bit of experience dealing with people directly it was easier on 
stage 
despite his following in england priest is well aware of the 
difficulty that reggae artists have selling records in the united 
states even bob marley had problems his only song to make the top 
10 was i shot the sheriff and that was a cover version by eric 
clapton 
im realizing that now priest said but this is a new 
generation the music is looking much much better bob opened the 
doors theres steel pulse aswad ziggy marley 
but dont go looking for any maxi priest sings cat stevens 
compilations im not a fan of cat stevens he said

ginny reilly has been both mommy and musician for 
seven years but mostly shes kept her babies and her bflats 
separate 
no more in her new album doodle lee doin reilly follows 
the course of motherhood from a womans yearning for a child to her 
pregnancy to the joys and frustrations of being a parent 
in a crystalclear soprano she sings a lullaby to the fetus 
locked inside her womb imploring the child not to be afraid to be 
born 
therell be stars above 
and warm soft woolen gloves 
and someone new to love 
when you come out and play 
she criticizes an infants manners i feed you all the night 
and day you throw it back right into my face but years later she 
misses the travails of caring for a baby theres nobody playing 
with the knobs and dials nobody giving me a toothless smile 
reilly has always found her inspiration in her own life in her 
20s and early 30s she says i wrote a lot about sad love affairs 
i kind of ran out of ideas there so i got married 
then came her children emily 7 and charlie 5 the 
inspiration for doodle lee doin the album cover shows a 
pregnant seated reilly with a coke cup balanced on her distended 
belly 
although there is a sweet sunniness to the album reilly does not 
suggest that motherhood has been as easy as apple pie 
in reality motherhood has been a real challenge to me its 
been hard says the 42yearold seattlebased singer 
between making beds vacuuming the floors and picking up the 
kids her energy and creativity flagged she had no time to write 
music the song emily was composed entirely in her head because 
she just didnt have a second to sit down with a guitar 
nor did she sing to her babies charlie actually would begin to 
cry when i sang to him she said 
charlie may be adorable like his mother and sister he has a 
crop of orange hair but his taste in music is questionable his 
mother has been singing professionally since 1968 and has sung with 
david maloney since 1970 
the duo billed as reilly amp maloney has put out seven albums on 
their own freckle records label which is run by reillys husband 
jack burg though they have toured widely theyre most popular on 
the west coast 
reilly has made one other solo album but had never considered a 
collection of the motherhood songs she had written over the years 
on tour she would sing one or two of the songs at each show 
the nightclub people arent too excited to hear all your baby 
songs back to back she says 
then three years ago she was asked to sing at a regional 
convention of the international childbirth education association 
she put together a program of appropriate songs and they were well 
received afterwards members of the audience lined up to buy tapes 
of her performance 
first i freaked out because they werent supposed to be 
selling my music then i thought maybe theres some interest in 
this she said 
it took a while to put the album together emily and charlie 
listened as she practiced songs about them and they kept a close 
tally of how many songs were about each child 
her album complete reilly thinks she knows why women have 
produced few songs about pregnancy and motherhood theyve been 
too busy doing it 
even given the time she says such songs may not draw any 
attention the only real womens music you see these days is by 
lesbians i sometimes say im going to do an album called songs for 
neurotic heterosexual women you have to be different and weird to 
get any attention nowadays 
she will sing some of the songs when she and maloney tour as 
they do about 100 days a year touring is tough but not necessarily 
because she is separated from her children 
the hard thing is to make the switch between working and being 
a housewife she said i get back into staying up late at night 
to work sleeping late in the morning talking to adults all day 
reading that old life i used to live when i was younger 
i get back here and wham i walk into the house and theres 
this whole other universe it takes days to get used to it ive 
been back seven days now and i just today got around to vacuuming 
the house

more than 45 years after russian tanks 
rolled through east prussia one of west germanys leading 
journalists has produced a haunting memoir of an aristocratic and 
traditionbound world shattered by war 
at the heart of countess marion doenhoffs best seller 
childhood in east prussia is the chronicle of a proud east 
prussian family which prospered there from the middle ages until 
1945 it also details the familys loss to the german war machine 
and the price it paid for resistance to nazi dictator adolf hitler 
doenhoff who will be 79 on dec 2 is copublisher of the 
respected weekly newspaper die zeit she shares the position with 
former west german chancellor helmut schmidt 
one of west germanys most respected journalists and political 
commentators she has been a firm advocate of improved relations 
with eastern europe and has worked for reconciliation with the 
victims of nazi aggression 
doenhoffs book comes 26 years after she detailed the familys 
dramatic flight from the advancing soviet army in a bestselling 
book titled forgotten names 
east prussia once the home of vast and imposing noble estates 
and the german military aristocracy was divided into parcels after 
world war ii and ceded to poland and the soviet union it bordered 
the baltic on the north and poland and lithuania in the south and 
east 
childhood in east prussia is filled with memories of the 
regions rustic landscape and the stern but unostentatious habits 
of doenhoffs family one of the regions oldest and a member of the 
kaisers court in berlin 
she also describes distinguished visitors to the doenhoff 
familys friedrichstein estate located in the sprawling timberrich 
region near the city of koenigsberg now kaliningrad in the soviet 
union 
referring to a visit in 1916 by field marshal paul von hindenburg 
to the family estate when she was a little girl doenhoff recalls 
that she was disappointed by the legendary officers appearance 
he was tall and heavy and walked with a stiff gait he did not 
look like the godly hero i had imagined him to be 
as a teenager she recalls exploring the family mansions attic 
where she discovered the dusty records and longforgotten 
memorabilia of generations of doenhoffs discoveries she says gave 
her a sense of how far back my direct and formative past 
stretches 
she also recounts the tragic fate of many of her relatives and 
friends and her own brushes with death 
writing of preparations by east prussian aristocrats who joined 
together to plot the illfated july 20 1944 assassination attempt 
against hitler doenhoff says we were among one of the circles of 
those sworn against hitler i was involved in some local 
preparations my cousin heini lehndorff with actions to carry it 
out 
lehndorff who was to help assuming command of the nazi garrison 
in koenigsberg was later executed in berlin along with hundreds of 
other plotters and their sympathizers a prominent local official 
whom she had won over to the side of the conspirators was also 
killed 
i anguished for a long time over why he had been killed and i 
was only questioned by the gestapo doenhoff writes 
later she learned that the mans name was on a captured list of 
those who were to take over local positions of power after hitlers 
assassination 
doenhoff writes that hitlers war also took a terrible toll on 
the sons of east prussias aristocracy many of whom fell in the 
soviet union 
thousands of civilians were also killed as russian troops 
advanced 
the doenhoff estate built in the 18th century was burned to the 
ground in 1945 by russian soldiers doenhoff says three of her 
nephews were killed in battle in russia as was a brother 
the coming war and the regions ultimate destruction and loss 
was often the subject of grim humor among the family as they 
renovated buildings and modernized the estates agricultural 
production 
we used to say the russians will be pleased with the 
improvements doenhoff writes long before 1939 we sensed that 
this insane war would come and the russians would be the inheritors 
of our labors 
extensive restoration efforts on the estate were completed just 
before it was destroyed 
it took decades for doenhoff to finally accept that her homeland 
was lost forever for years i hoped that a miracle would happen 
although my political studies had proved that there could be no 
miracles in this area 
the realities of postwar politics and the importance of 
improving relations with eastern europe forced her to accept its 
irrevocable loss 
if we wanted normalization we needed clarity over the final 
borders doenhoff said 
the parcels ceded to the soviet union and poland after the war 
were made permanent in treaties ratified between 1970 and 1972 as 
part of efforts by the west german government to pursue an active 
rapproachment or ostpolitik with the soviet bloc 
despite recognition of the political necessities regarding east 
prussia doenhoff says the emotional legacy remains 
even today after living happily in hamburg for decades i 
answer east prussia instinctively and without thinking when asked 
where my home is i miss the landscape of this lost land

for small investors the best thing to do about 
the turmoil in the california insurance industry is to sit still at 
least for now 
the outcome of the battle over the ratereducing proposition 103 
in california is too uncertain to permit informed speculation about 
which way the stocks of the insurers are headed analysts say 
our strategy right now is if you own do nothing there will be 
better opportunities later on the speculative side said carol 
manning an analyst for smith barney harris upham amp co 
the uncertainty is so strong that you cant assess who 
ultimately will be most adversely affected you also cannot at this 
point in time assess the companies that will take advantage of 
whatever opportunities will develop from the change in the law 
ms manning said 
once we begin to know what rules will prevail then you can 
begin to make assessments as to what companies will be either 
adversely or positively affected she said 
proposition 103 which was approved by california voters this 
past week requires an immediate reduction of at least 20 percent in 
property and casualty insurance rates including auto rates 
throughout the state 
at first it would seem that such a proposition would knock the 
legs out from under the stocks of companies that do a lot of 
business in california that has not happened for two reasons 
1 passage of prop 103 was widely expected and almost anyone who 
wanted to sell did so well in advance 
2 because of legal challenges and action in the state 
legislature prop 103 may never go into effect although some kind 
of rate relief is almost certain 
consider mercury general corp a los angelesbased auto insurer 
that has publicly said that proposition 103 if it took effect 
would force the company out of business 
so what happened on tuesday when california voters trooped to 
the polls to pass the proposition the stock rose 50 cents a share 
in overthecounter trading 
the stock backed off 12 cents a share on wednesday but it shot 
up 112 to 1462 on thursday after the california supreme court 
temporarily stayed the proposition to allow time for a review of its 
constitutionality 
in short an investor who got cold feet and sold at mondays 
closing price would have missed out on an 11 percent profit in just 
three days anyone who wanted to get out should have done so back in 
early 1987 when mercury general touched 25 a share 
besides mercury general other insurers who get the bulk of their 
revenue from the california market include 20th century industries 
inc and zenith national insurance corp 
firemans fund insurance cos and ohio casualty insurance co get 
about a quarter of their revenue from california ms manning 
estimates 
at the other extreme is us fidelity amp guaranty co known as 
usfampg which counts on california for less than 5 percent of its 
premiums the slight exposure to california is one reason ms 
manning recommends the stock 
most analysts say voters in other states will not rush to enact 
their own proposition 103s when they see the turmoil generated by 
californias including the number of insurers that say they will 
stop doing business in the state 
for the insurance companies the ideal solution would be 
legislative and judicial reforms that would discourage frivolous 
litigation and fat jury awards with reforms in place they could 
afford to roll back rates and still stay in business 
what happens from here is the 64 question said john snyder 
an assistant vice president at firemark insurance research an 
investment banking and research firm in parsippany nj 
its a very sensitive time for the stocks he said

africanized bees have a nasty temper and a 
killer reputation but agriculture department experts say a small 
parasite carried by the bees may present the biggest problem to the 
american farm scene 
hachiro shimanuki a microbiologist at the usda beneficial 
insects laboratory in beltsville md said the africanized bees are 
known carriers of a devastating bee mite called the varroa jacobsoni 
this mite is particularly harmful said shimanuki it can 
quickly infect a hive and it kills the brood of the honey bee and 
reduces the life of the adult bee 
shimanuki said mites have been found in at least two swarms of 
africanized bees popularly known as killer bees accidently brought 
to the us by ship and the mite is common among africanized swarms 
in argentina brazil bolivia and uraguay 
one miteinfected swarm was carried by a ship up the st lawrence 
seaway and discovered in illinois another was found last year 
aboard a ship that docked in florida said shimaunki 
the major concern with the mite is that it could force states 
to restrict the movement of bee hives in this country said the 
scientist 
bee hives are critical to the pollenation of cranberries and 
blueberries in the northeast and to almonds and alfalfa seeds in 
california other crops are assisted in pollenation by domestic bee 
hives bee keepers in florida and texas annually haul thousands of 
hives to the northern states during the crop flowering season to 
help the plants make fruit 
without the bees said shimaunki production would definitely 
decline 
there are native pollenators in the areas but the farmers 
cant count on them he said farmers will use bee hive 
pollenators as insurance 
shimanuki said there is a real concern that the africanized bees 
now slowly moving northward in mexico and expected to reach texas by 
1990 will bring in a huge population of the mites that could wipe 
out many domestic hives 
mite infestations in florida and texas could force states not 
infected to restrict the movement of bee hives thus depriving some 
northern crops of critical pollenation services said shimanuki 
usda bee experts are monitoring every swarm of africanized bees 
found in the us and checking for the presence of the mites a 
swarm was found oct 31 on a ship docked in gainesville fla and 
three others have been found on ships in florida over the last two 
years the swarms are destroyed and samples sent to the usda 
laboratory in beltsville 
shimanuki said the usda also is monitoring the natural northward 
migration of the africanized bees through the use of traps located 
in mexico and along the texas border 
african bees were brought to brazil more than 30 years ago by bee 
experts who hoped to increase honey production through a 
crossbreeding program in 1957 some of the african queen bees were 
released in brazil and hybrid descendants have been moving northward 
since 
shimanuki said the africanized bees are slightly smaller than the 
european bees used by domestic bee keepers but the essential 
difference between the two is in temper and territorial defense 
european bees are calm and not easily motivated to attack 
you could safely sit on their hive said shimanuki 
africanized bees however sense threats everywhere for example 
he said the vibration of a distant tractor could agitate an african 
swarm into attacking any animal or human within a quarter mile of 
the hive 
and once the attack starts the african bees will sting more 
persistently and in greater numbers than domestic bees 
africanized bees easily mix and crossbreed with domestic bees 
often passing along their dangerous tendencies 
as a result shimanuki said africanized bees may wipe out a 
thriving backyard bee industry in the united states parttime 
beekeepers who now can keep hives in semirural areas may have to 
end the practice if their hives become africanized he said 
there is a real liability concern said shimanuki the 
location of where you could have hives would be much more limited 
beekeeping to make honey and to provide pollenation services is 
now a 20 billion business in the united states and africanized 
bees and the mite they carry pose at real threat to the industry he 
said

early on election day sudden panic swept 
through the top echelon of the george bush campaign as overnight 
tracking polls suggested a 810 point lead sustained for a week 
might be collapsing 
suddenly bush strategists began wringing their hands and seeing a 
new vulnerability that as it turned out wasnt really there 
the nervousness in the final hours might have been expected in a 
campaign that many political analysts now point to as a textbook 
example of stateoftheart sophistication in political showmanship 
and although former sen barry goldwater rariz has scoffed 
at a campaign run by madison avenue bush strategists point to 
these techniques as an important factor in bushs victory 
some examples 
constant polling by bush pollster robert teeter involving no 
fewer than 1000 calls each night was used extensively to guide 
bushs itinerary enabling him get the most political bang from each 
appearance 
careful earlyon efforts to shore up support in the vice 
presidents base of support in the south and the far west gave him 
the luxury of not having to spend time in these areas in the crucial 
closing days 
advanced facsimile and other commnications equipment aboard air 
force two enabled campaign chairman james a baker iii to call the 
shots from his fullystaffed wellequipped headquarters in 
washington virtually no decisions were made on the road 
all aspects of the campaign were cooridanted in advance stump 
speeches were designed to look good on television themes were 
repeated for days even weeks television advertising buys were 
timed to back up the themes 
ads and various attack lines were auditioned first before 
bipartisan focus groups of human guinea pigs bushs repeated 
taunting of rival michael dukakis on the pledge of allegiance and on 
massachusetts prison furloughs grew out of such sessions 
but such carefully laid plans didnt keep momentary panic from 
setting in as bush aides watched the early and unreliable 
polling data that showed his edge over dukakis may have slipped to 4 
percent or less 
bush recalled he was being bombarded by conflicting words from 
top aidess some telling him these exit polls dont mean a thing 
and others arguing but wait a second 
the early count was this the later count was something else 
all of that adds to the nervous tension the presidentelect told 
reporters on his trip back to washington on wednesday from houston 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager says that the race was 
always much closer than polls of any given day might have suggested 
the brutal fact that all republicans are aware of is that there 
are more democrats in the country than republicans atwater said 
meaning the victory of bush or any other gop presidential candidate 
depended upon democrtic votes 
two things got us where we are the vice presidents acceptance 
speech and the second debate atwater said 
and he added our ability to checkmate what they were doing 
dukakis team made several crucial errors atwater and other bush 
strategists contend failure to react quickly enough to bushs 
attacks a period of wallowing in late summer due to a misreading of 
public sentiment toward gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle 
and developing their best shot dukakis populist i am on your 
side theme too late in the campaign for it to be effective 
analysts of both parties claim bushs carefully crafted 
acceptance speech at the gop convention in august helped him emerge 
forcefully from the shadow of president reagan 
at the same time analysts suggest bushs lyrical appeal for a 
kinder gentler nation and his emphasis on daycare and other 
family problems helped him build support where he most needed it 
among women voters 
dukakis was flat footed when bush agressively went on the 
attack said norman ornstein a political analyst with the 
conservative american enterprise institute 
bob beckel who was 1984 democratic nominee walter mondales 
campaign manager said bush and his people made a much faster 
transition from the primary to the general election than did the 
dukakis campaign 
and david garth a democratic consultant who was an adviser to 
sen albert gore jr dtenn said dukakis early surge in the 
polls was a false one due mostly to his defeat of rival jesse 
jackson 
he never got rid of jackson or put him in perspective garth 
said 
nearly all analysts also point to two of bushs biggest campaign 
assets the state of the us economy with the nation in the sixth 
year of a record peactime expansion and to a lesser degree the 
continued popularity of reagan to whom bush emerged as the clear 
heir apparent by knocking off a full field of gop rivals early in 
the primary season

hes a singer songwriter actor activist 
ecologist and aspiring space traveler but what john denver really 
wants to be right now is heard on the radio again 
we always had to struggle to get my records on the air but 
when we did i had incredible success he said in an interview 
here at the start of his american tour one of the problems ive 
always had even at the height of my career was that i was never 
a radio darling i didnt have the hype going that a lot of rock 
singers had that mystique was just not part of what i was doing 
the format at a lot of the stations now is not the kind of 
songs or kind of sound im doing i still like to use a real 
orchestra not a synthesizer or a drum machine real people live 
music but thats not whats going on out there right now 
the 44yearold denver is out with a new album higher 
ground on his own label windstar the lp is being distrubuted 
by allegiance records of hollywood calif denver left rca records 
after 25 albums 13 of which went gold and eight platinum in the 
us alone 
his easylistening countrycrossover style made a string of hit 
singles in the 1970s rocky mountain high sunshine on my 
shoulder back home again annies song take me home 
country road and thank god im a country boy his greatest 
hits lp still ranks as the bestselling album in rca history 
they really took me for granted denver said i was one of 
the few artists on the label and i probably had the best contract 
they had and i was in the black at the time i delivered my last 
album one world in 1986 rca had just been sold to general 
electric and i was in line for a new contract i had every right to 
expect as good a contract as i had if not better 
but the new management wanted to show a profit quickly and it 
was more than they wanted to spend rcas promotional people never 
supported me anyway radio was resistent to me and i was a hard 
sell so why bother 
one of the reasons for establishing my own label was to have 
the clout and the budget to say this is what i want t be done and 
get this record on the air 
the new lp is in the same vein as denvers others its heavy on 
love ballads for you never a doubt and whispering 
jesse 
im a hopeless romantic said denver who in august married 
australian singer cassandra delaney 
other cuts mix denvers vocals and acoustic guitar work with his 
usual introspective lyrics higher ground all this joy 
country girl in paris while other songs are for causes sing 
australia written for australias bicentennial bread amp roses 
for the feminist movement and fallen leaves the refugees for 
the worlds homeless 
denver has traveled the globe for concerts and benefits in his 
20year career he visited africa in 1985 to call attention to the 
hunger problem and did fundraising shows in 1987 for the victims of 
the chernobyl nuclear power accident in the soviet union in 1976 
he helped establish the snowmass colobased windstar foundation 
which is working toward world peace and world ecology 
one of the problems in the world today is most of us think the 
problems or the bureaucracies are so great that we cant make a 
difference he said i want to prove that to be inaccurate i 
want to demonstrate that an individual can make a difference 
born john deutschendorf in roswell nm and raised in oklahoma 
arizona and texas as an air force brat denver moved to los angeles 
to be a folk musician and wrote the megahit leavin on a jet 
plane in 1969 
he now is a licensed jet pilot and said he has longed for space 
travel since he was 10 years old when he looked up at the stars one 
night and was just enthralled with wonder of what was up there 
denver was instrumental in the start of the citizens for space 
program and even volunteered to be the first to go 
now that nasa has decided to put the citizens program on hold 
following the illfated challenger mission two years ago denver had 
considered going on a soviet flight in december 1989 however he 
missed the nov 1 deadline and balked at the 10 million price he 
said the soviets wanted him to pay 
im not willing to pay that its not ethical and it makes it 
look like whoever can come up with 10 million can fly in space 
i dont want this to look like a stunt i want to do something 
up there id like to do a radio program for the week im up there 
for children all over the world and also host a television show 
denver best remembered on the silver screen for his role in oh 
god recently starred in a summer tv movie called higher 
ground about an alaskan bush pilot 
plans for a series were scrapped so denver could embark on his 
current songs of the future songs of the past concert tour 
which began oct 5 at arizona state university and will crisscross 
the country through dec 18 
life is really going great for me now denver said i feel 
great about the quality of work im doing and the way the records 
being received i just got married again im 44 and its like im 
starting all over again ive never been happier

prices of wholesale goods and housing in the northeast are 
showing some temporary improvement according to two new reports 
the government said thursday in its regular monthly report on 
producer prices that wholesale inflation slowed to zero in october 
as food costs dropped for the first time since february 
freshfruit prices fell 92 percent to lead a 01 percent decline 
in food prices reflecting an easing of the effects of the summer 
drought the labor department reported 
food prices had been climbing at an annual rate of 8 percent 
before the reversal which appeared to buck the latest trend of 
government reports showing strong growth in the economy 
but analysts cautioned against reading too much into the report 
they said consumers can expect a second round of droughtrelated 
increases next spring when shortages of meat and pork appear because 
of earlierthannormal slaughters this year 
its just temporary said michael evans who runs a private 
economic forecasting firm in washington next year well see the 
lag effects of the drought and food prices will be up sharply 
again 
energy prices rose a slight 03 percent in october as a 46 
percent increase in natural gas prices caused primarily by shortages 
in the northeast was offset by a 101 percent decline in home 
heating oil prices and no change in gasoline prices 
the housing market report from the national association of 
realtors said home prices continue soaring in california but 
appreciation rates in the once redhot markets of new york boston 
and hartford conn were below the national average in the third 
quarter the median price in philadelphia actually fell by 35 
percent 
home prices in the new york metropolitan area including long 
island and northern new jersey rose to 192600 in the quarter up 
12 percent from the same period a year earlier 
prices were up 10 percent in boston to a median of 184100 
meaning half of the homes sold for more and half for less 
nationally the thirdquarter median resale price for 
singlefamily homes was 90200 up 39 percent from a year earlier

deal with the us trade and budget deficits 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks which had fallen 
925 points wednesday after bushs victory declined 355 to close

george bush may avoid the worst of the trade 
friction that has plagued usjapan relations during the reagan 
administration but the huge trade imbalance and currency 
fluctuations will remain major issues in the next four years 
trade figures released thursday showed japans surplus with the 
united states declined less than expected in october falling 3 
percent to 483 billion from 498 billion a year earlier it was 
the 10th straight monthly decline 
japans overall trade surplus rose 13 percent to 769 billion 
from 885 billion a year earlier 
octobers marginal decline in the bilateral trade surplus is an 
indication the trade imbalance is proving more stubborn than had 
been expected said peter morgan chief economist at barclays de 
zoete wedd securities japan ltd 
theres some question of how sustainable the decline is we 
were actually looking for a faster rate of improvement but its not 
coming through morgan said 
although lower oil prices are a major factor depressing growth in 
the value of japans imports and hence contributing to the 
ballooning trade surplus overall imports are weak relative to 
japans strong domestic economic growth 
if the us trade deficit does not shrink quickly enough there 
will be heavy pressure in the united states to drive the dollar down 
further against the japanese yen and west german mark morgan said 
japan has successfully weathered retaliatory us trade sanctions 
and the impact of the yens appreciation against the dollar on its 
exports fueling economic growth with domestic economic demand but 
wild fluctuations in currency exchange rates could destabilize even 
the robust japanese economy analysts say 
japanese business and government officials expressed confidence 
following the election that the bush victory was a welcome sign of 
continuity 
we dont distinguish between ronald reagan and george bush 
they are working toward this noble cause usjapan ties as a 
team there is no reason to think bush would be acting differently 
from mr reagan said yukio okamoto director of the foreign 
ministrys first north america division 
the new us trade act directs the new president to restrict 
imports from nations that accumulate trade surpluses because of what 
he deems unfair trade practices 
nevertheless bushs support for free trade we need to 
increase our exports not shut our borders he has said has 
reassured tokyo 
bush advisers have said the presidentelect feels new policies 
are needed to cope with changing global economic patterns 
that means with our allies to develop a system which will 
replace the kind of trade economic and monetary system put in place 
by the bretton woods conference of 1944 dominated by the dollar 
in the postwar world which has collapsed said gen brent 
scowcroft foreign policy adviser to the bush campaign 
in addition to improving trade japanese leaders would like to 
see the united states trim its federal budget deficit 
reagan left the problem of huge fiscal and trade deficits the 
bush administration will have to pay back his debts stated an

time inc hopes to enlarge its already 
substantial entertainment and television operations and plans to 
expand aggressively outside the united states to assure its place 
among the global media giants in the mid1990s 
j richard munro chairman and chief executive and nj nicholas 
jr president told financial analysts thursday that potential 
acquisitions or partnerships could include movie or programming 
production companies television networks cable operations or 
publishing concerns 
they refused to be more specific but munro cautioned that times 
interest in making deals doesnt mean we are going to jump at 
whatever junk food comes along 
media analyst peter appert of cj lawrence morgan grenfell said 
time appeared to be laying out their plans for us but i dont 
sense that anything is in fact imminent 
in trading on the new york stock exchange time rose 1 a share 
to 10550 
munro said recent foreign takeovers of big us media companies 
indicate foreigners are playing a worldwide game that americans 
must join or find themselves in second place 
among recent buyouts were australianbased news corps 3 
billion acquisition of triangle publications publisher of tv guide 
and british publisher robert maxwells 26 billion purchase of 
macmillan inc 
munro said that by the mid1990s the media and entertainment 
industry will be composed of a limited number of global giants 
some will be european some asian the rest american time 
inc intends to be one of these companies he said 
nicholas said time is looking for companies with a high return 
or absent that a major strategic benefit for time 
munro said the dollars decline has helped foreign companies bid 
successfully for us media concerns he said regulatory changes 
over the next three years that will permit television networks to 
own cable systems and to own and syndicate their own productions 
also should encourage consolidation 
every player in the mediaentertainment business at least 
every smart one will be trying to do the same thing to build 
enterprises that can lay off the risk of increased production costs 
over as many worldwide distribution systems as possible he said 
time the biggest us magazine publisher already has an 
interest in cable television through its 80 percent ownership of 
american television and communications corp the nations second 
largest cable operator it is involved in programming through its 
home box office inc the pay television network 
time reportedly was in failed merger talks earlier this year with 
warner communications inc the entertainment giant with interests 
in film making and cable operations 
both munro and nicholas said they could not comment on those 
reports 
nicholas said time had no intention of selling its scott 
foresman amp co educational publishing unit which reportedly was on 
the block earlier this year he said it offers international 
expansion possibilities 
in midseptember times stock ran up sharply on speculation that 
it was considering a leveraged buyout or a restructuring 
munro did not directly address that matter but told the analysts 
that times management and board dont regard this as just another 
media company to be leveraged or dismantled in the interests of 
shortterm gain

despite court challenges in two states 
pillsbury cos poison pill continues to be a potent defense 
against a 523 billion takeover bid from britains grand 
metropolitan plc 
hennepin county district court judge thomas carey on thursday 
rejected a request from dissident shareholders to block the takeover 
defense and said no to their request to force pillsbury to discuss 
grand mets 60ashare tender offer 
but after hearing from the shareholders that pillsburys board 
was engaging in unlawful entrenchment by spurning the suitor 
carey urged the food and restaurant company to sit down and talk 
with grand met 
said larry commers a lawyer for grand met its a step in the 
right direction 
pillsbury stock closed up 12 cents thursday at 5862 per share 
in new york stock exchange trading 
pillsburys board of directors on oct 17 rejected the tender 
offer as inadequate and on monday offered shareholders the 
alternative of a special dividend and stock in burger king which 
would be spun off as a separate public company pillsbury chairman 
philip smith also said further moves to enhance shareholder value 
are under consideration 
jack chestnut a lawyer representing shareholders in a 
classaction suit said the deal proposed by pillsbury so far would 
be worth only about 43 a share leaving the pill intact stifles 
grand mets allcash offer which could be withdrawn he said 
now is the time to put a deal on the table chestnut said 
what harm is there your honor really in forcing these two 
corporate behemoths to sit down and negotiate 
grand met has said the pill makes the cost of a takeover 
prohibitive and has sued in delaware chancery court to have it 
lifted that request was denied monday by retired justice william 
duffy who ruled that as of oct 17 pillsburys directors had not 
abdicated their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting grand 
mets offer as inadequate 
carey said pillsburys board has been diligent in its handling of 
the takeover bid but he restrained the company from raising legal 
issues such as state tiedhouse statutes to impede possible 
negotiations 
pillsbury has sued grand met in 14 states on grounds that a 
takeover would violate those laws which forbid liquor distillers 
from selling alcohol at retail outlets 
grand met a liquor gambling and franchise conglomerate has 
said it would sell the fullservice restaurants owned by pillsbury 
if the takeover succeeds 
steven rothschild an attorney for pillsbury said pillsburys 
board has an obligation to keep the poison pill in place in the face 
of an inadequate offer he said grand mets own financial advisers 
have said the value of pillsbury stock is more than 60 a share 
under the poison pill or shareholders rights plan 
pillsbury shareholders could buy stock in the company at half price 
should a hostile suitor acquire 20 percent of pillsbury shares for 
grand met it could increase the cost of a takeover to 20 billion 
nearly 75 percent of the outstanding pillsbury shares have been 
tendered to grand met which has extended the expiration date for a 
second time to nov 14 
chestnut claimed pillsbury shareholders stand to lose more than 
1 billion if grand met withdraws its offer 
separately pillsbury filed suit in washington dc to 
invalidate a maritime administration decision approving the 
ownership transfer to grand mets parent wendell investment of 61 
barges and tugboats owned by a pillsbury subsidiary 
the suit filed in us district court alleged the agency 
violated procedures in approving the transfer of americanowned 
vessels to a foreign buyer if wendell and grand met take over 
pillsbury

specialty steelmaker allegheny ludlum corp 
says it will share its surge of profits with shareholders and 
employees as it plans for a management change and an acquisition 
1988 is a year that is unique in the 35 years that ive been in 
specialty steel said richard simmons chairman and chief 
executive 
simmons on thursday announced a special cash dividend of 350 
per share and a boost in the regular quarterly dividend from 12 
cents to 25 cents per share 
with 2275 million shares outstanding the moves will cost about 
85 million 
the pittsburghbased maker of stainless steel sheet and strip and 
electrical steels also will pay 6 million as a 4 percent 
discretionary bonus to employees further profit sharing payouts are 
expected through 1990 he said 
simmons meanwhile said he will step down as chief excutive in 
18 months and has recommended the board elect robert p bozzone as 
chief executive until bazzones planned retirement less than five 
years from now simmons 57 has headed the company since 1972 
because the exit of simmons and bozzone would leave the company 
with only one officer who has been in place more than two years 
allegheny ludlum is bringing in arthur aronson lukens steel co 
president and chief operating officer as executive vice president 
the allegheny ludlum board also authorized investing 25 million 
in a leveraged buyout fund that will seek acquisitions of 100 
million or less 
simmons son brian 28 is among the general partners of the 
firm forming the fund the chairman said he did not participate in 
the negotiations and the voting on the investment to avoid any 
conflict of interest 
were particularly sensitive to that issue simmons said 
for that reason outside directors have been responsible and have 
made most of the decisions with regard to this 
despite the new spending and a 150 million capital investment 
plan previously announced allegheny ludlum still will have cash in 
excess of its debt simmons said debt totals about 82 million and 
cash about 90 million 
allegheny ludlum reported profits of 85 million or 376 per 
share on sales of 9132 million for the first nine months of the 
year compared to profits of 355 million or 181 per share on 
sales of 632 million in the 1987 period

further signs of a weakening 
semiconductor industry have surfaced with the announcement that 
advanced micro devices inc will lay off up to 1000 workers because 
of fewer orders from personal computer makers 
and wj sanders iii chairman and chief executive officer of 
amd on thursday characterized prospects for immediate improvement 
in his company as bleak 
based on current order levels we expect sales to decline in 
the fourth quarter and foresee no material improvement in the 
immediate future sanders said 
the layoff announcement came on the heels of monthly figures by 
the semiconductor industry association showing a 216 percent 
decline in shipments by semiconductor manufacturers worldwide to 
us customers in october the biggest decline in 13 years 
furthermore the associations booktobill ratio of 092 for

go into a major tailspin

recently predicted moderate industry growth in 1989 followed by 
improved sales that would follow expected industry dollar growth of 
358 percent in 1988 
advanced micro devices the nations fifthlargest computer chip 
maker recently laid off 1400 workers in malaysia and the 
philippines after an expected summer pickup in sales failed to 
materialize

four of its domestic manufacturing plants located in sunnyvale and 
santa clara in california and austin and san antonio in texas but 
most cuts will be made in the san francisco area said spokesman 
john greenagel 
the cuts will occur in areas where entire projects will be phased 
out he said 
we are eliminating certain programs that are not promisingin 
order to concentrate on resources and on growth markets said 
greenagel who would not comment on which programs would be cut 
company officials blamed the reduction on weakening demand for 
integrated circuits from personal computer customers including

michael stark an industry analyst at robertson colman amp 
stephens of san francisco said the layoffs indicate the companys 
troubles have been compounded by its difficulty in making memory 
chips with advanced manufacturing processes already mastered by 
competitors 
the company employs about 5500 people in the bay area and 3000 
people in texas worldwide amd employs about 15800 workers and is 
the largest company in the world exclusively manufacturing 
integrated circuits 
during 1987 amd recorded 997 million in sales and lost 48 
million the company recorded 53 million in profits during the 
first nine months of this year but expects to lose money during the 
fourth quarter officials said 
the sias figures showed that us japanese and european chip 
makers had shipped 102 billion in chips to us customers in 
october compared to 13 billion in september 
the sias booktobill ratio of 092 for october means that chip 
makers received 92 worth of new orders from us customers for

the dollar fell sharply in active european trading 
today before the bank of england reportedly stepped in to buy 
dollars late in the morning gold prices were higher 
the dollar fell to a 10month low against the japanese yen and to 
fivemonth lows against the west german mark and the british pound 
before the bank of england reportedly started buying dollars and 
selling yen on behalf of the bank of japan at about 11 am 
foreign exchange dealers expressed surprise that other major 
european central banks had not entered the market to boost the 
dollar 
dealers said the japanese central bank intervened in singapore 
after the tokyo session ended today buying dollars after the dollar 
fell below 123 yen dealers said 
the west german bundesbank might wait until next week before 
intervening to support the dollar a milan trader said he argued 
that the absence of many traders due to a holiday in several 
european countries meant any dollar buying by central banks on the 
open market would have less psychological effect 
however another milan trader said the dollar may have bottomed 
out and could rebound later in fridays session 
i cant believe that the dollar can keep falling every day 
the trader said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 040 yen to a closing 12370 yen later in london 
it fell further to 12265 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late thursdays

the us dollar hit a 10month low against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the most widely

moving in a narrow range of 1236312388 yen the us currency had 
closed in tokyo thursday at 12410 yen 
securities dealers attributed the sharp gain on the stock market 
to generally bullish market sentiments the market is viewing lower 
oil prices and the strong yen favorably they said 
institutional investors and trust fund managers seem to start 
participating in the market again said keiichi nishida a dealer 
at kidder peabodys tokyo office also the fact the we have not 
heard bad news on the emperors condition in the past three days is 
helping share prices rise 
the condition of japans emperor hirohito who has been bedridden 
since sept 19 took a sudden turn for the worse tuesday and share 
prices tumbled on the tokyo market the following day but he has 
been reported stable since then 
on the foreign exchange market dealers said the dollars decline 
reflects the markets general sentiment toward the currency 
it was the lowest value for the us currency against the yen 
since it hit 12165 yen jan 4 
the dollar could have gone lower if the bank of japan did not 
prop it up said an exchange dealer at a major us commercial 
bank in tokyo 
he said the central bank intervened moderately in the market 
today when the dollar was trading at around 12370 yen other 
dealers said the bank of japans intervention was considerable to 
the tune of 400 million dollars 
it is unlikely that well see the dollar go below 12350 yen at 
this point he said

the selection of a texas site to build the superconducting super 
collider effectively ends the race among 25 states to capture the 
economic benefits tied to construction of the massive project here 
is a summary of the economics of the super collider 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
building cost the energy department estimates the collider will 
cost 44 billion the congressional budget office said it could 
take 64 billion if costs follow the pattern for atom smashers 
already built their more conservative estimate of 51 billion 
still tops the energy departments 
operating cost plans call for an annual budget of 270 million 
future costs the department estimates the total cost for 
building and operating the collider for 25 years at 108 billion in 
1988 dollars 
employment the project should generate 3000 permanent jobs and 
an additional 4000 for construction 
other economic impact besides project jobs local businesses 
should benefit from the scientific and other spinoffs of a new 
industry also the influx of highly trained personnel working on 
the collider is expected to improve local socioeconomic and 
educational standards 
the negatives opponents to the collider fear the project will 
siphon muchneeded money away from other scientific research others 
fear detrimental effects on the environment in addition 500 
residents of ellis county texas will lose all or some of their 
property to the project 
the obstacles the energy department must prepare a fullfledged 
environmental statement before the selection can be finalized funds 
could be hard to come by congress has not yet appropriated money to 
build the collider providing money only for engineering design and 
some research and development items in all congress has 
appropriated 205 million for the project

minstar inc stockholders have approved a plan 
under which an investor group led by company chairman irwin jacobs 
will take the firm private for 420 million 
under terms of the deal approved thursday jacobs and his 
partners will buy all of the firms outstanding common stock for 
3150 a share 
a cash tender offer for about 857 percent of the stock was 
completed in july 
the deal represents a healthy premium for minstar stockholders 
who saw the price of their shares decline from a high of 35 in 1986 
to the mid20s in the past year 
minstar stock closed at 23 a share in overthecounter trading 
thursday 
jacobs minstars largest investor will get about 77 million 
from the transaction about 64 million in cash 106 million in 
debentures and 27 million from cashing in stock options 
he has said it would be difficult to calculate his exact profits 
on the transaction because he acquired his stock during the past 
several years at varying prices 
jacobs will continue to be the largest shareholder in the new 
private company with about 23 percent of the stock 
minneapolis banker carl pohlad a longtime business associate of 
jacobs will hold an 18 percent stake according to proxy materials 
filed in connection with the deal pohlad also will serve on the 
board of the private company which will do business as genmar 
industries inc genmar was minstars boat manufacturing subsidiary 
minstar was formed out of the remnants of arctic enterprises 
inc a snowmobile and boat company in thief river falls that jacobs 
acquired with pohlad in 1977 
jacobs sometimes used minstar as a vehicle for corporate 
takeovers which expanded the boat business but also put the company 
into the sporting goods energy and moving and storage businesses 
all those businesses except for a foreign sporting goods unit 
expected to be sold next year have since been sold

a british brewery on friday won a high court order 
temporarily preventing usbased anchor brewing co from selling a 
rival brand of draught real ale in britain 
cornish brewery co had complained to justice john knox that 
customers wanting their newquay steam beer could be confused by the 
anchor steam beer produced by san franciscobased anchor brewing 
the judge granted the cornish brewery an order preventing the 
american company from selling or marketing draught anchor steam in 
this country pending full hearing of the action being brought by 
cornish brewery 
anchor brewing has been selling bottled version in britain since 
may and was planning to introduce the keg variety 
the judge said cornish brewery had on the evidence before him 
an arguable case that drinkers wanting draught steam might be 
confused by the two brands 
but he said bottled versions of the two ales looked very 
different and customers were not likely to be confused over them 
the cornish companys range of newquay steam beers were first 
marketed in britain in 1987 lawyers said the name steam comes 
from a cornish slang word for strong lager 
anchor steam was first produced in america in the last century 
the name came from the frothy nature of the drink lawyers said

standard amp poors corp one of the 
nations major debt rating services today reestablished its 
ratings on about 59 billion bonds sold to finance three washington 
public power supply system nuclear power plants wppss spokesman 
gary petersen said 
the move made possible by legislation signed last week by 
president reagan removes one of the last impediments to refinancing 
highinterest wppss bonds said petersen 
refinancing could save the region 50 million to 70 million a 
year over nearly 30 years on electricity bills he said 
weve worked seven and onehalf years for this petersen said 
the ratings on 59 billion worth of bonds for wppss plants nos 
1 2 and 3 were placed at sampps aa rating which places it among 
the services higher ratings levels 
the decision does not affect the rating on 225 billion in bonds 
sold to finance construction on wppss plants 4 and 5 they retain 
sampps d rating its lowest rating designating bonds in default 
the supply system defaulted on those bonds in 1983 it was the 
biggest default in the history of the municipal bond market and 
resulted in a trial that began sept 7 in tucson ariz only three 
defendants remain of the original list of more than 100 defendants 
in that case 
debt ratings serve as a guide to investors who are trying to 
judge the chances that bonds will be repaid on time 
petersen said standard amp poors told wppss it was able to 
reestablish bond ratings because of the bankruptcy bill that became 
law on nov 3 that measure strengthens the socalled china wall 
between wppss plants 1 2 and 3 and the defaulted plants nos 4 and 
5 and assures that creditors on nos 4 and 5 cannot attach the 
assets of the other three plants 
the bonds on wppss 1 2 and 3 are protected by a financing 
arrangement with the federal bonneville power administration that 
protection did not extend to wppss nos 4 and 5 
petersen said the supply system staff was preparing steps to 
return to the bond market 
our intent is to hopefully have a small bond sale by june or 
july of next year he said after that wppss would be expected to 
sell other bonds sold in the late 1970s and early 1980s and some of 
which carry an interest rate as high as 15 percent 
one piece of legislation critical to the supply systems 
refinancing plans is the technical corrections amendment to the 1986 
tax reform act it has passed congress and must be approved by 
president reagan by early next week said petersen 
that measure would allow advance sale of 2 billion of wppss 
highinterest bonds and is necessary for refinancing the bonds on 
wppss plants nos 1 and 3 bonds on no 2 can not be sold in 
advance under the tax reform act 
of the five wppss plants no 2 is operating nos 1 and 3 are 
mothballed partially complete and nos 4 and 5 were abandoned

to the current generation of buyout and merger 
mavens handsoff antitrust policies and laws that allow generous 
tax writeoffs are the grease that keeps their deal machine humming 
but as george bush emerges from the shadow of ronald reagan and 
heads to the white house some experts believe his more moderate 
ways might put a damper on the freemarket wheeling and dealing that 
flourished under his predecessor 
the burst of deals announced in the past month including some 
of the biggest in history and many between competitors in the same 
industry has been fueled in part by fear that any change under a 
new administration will be a turn for the worse 
people are doing deals just to get under the wire said 
joseph bartlett a partner in the law firm gaston amp snow and a 
former undersecretary of commerce in the johnson administration 
they dont know if theyre going to get hit with a left hook or 
a right hook so theyre saying lets do the deal now 
when it comes to antitrust issues however companies may have 
little to fear the pendulum began to swing toward looser 
enforcement in the 1970s under the reagan adminstration there have 
been no challenges to vertical mergers those between customers and 
their suppliers or to combinations of unrelated companies noted 
robert pitofsky dean of georgetown university law center 
even more telling between 1982 and 1986 the government 
challenged less than 1 percent of deals large enough to require 
antitrust approval he said 
socalled horizontal mergers those betweeen companies in the 
same industry have proliferated in this environment campeau 
corp for example had little regulatory difficulty acquiring 
federated department stores inc for 66 billion earlier this year 
even though the canadian firm has extensive retail operations in the 
united states 
although such combinations may go against the academic grain the 
ranks of defenders of these deals are legion 
antitrust policy depends on the market and 20 years ago the 
market was the good ol usa bartlett said we were almost 
totally oriented toward domestic markets and there was little 
offshore competition the idea of a philip morriskraft combination 
20 years ago would have been ludicrous and it wouldnt even have 
been proposed 
today however philip morris and kraft can defend their 131 
billion merger as an attempt to compete with unilever the giant 
swiss foods conglomerate 
both philip morris and kraft are cooperating with government 
requests for information necessary for an antitrust review 
if were really going to compete in world trade there has to 
be some room for large companies claiming efficiencies pitofsky 
said at the same time he believes that if an industry has just 
three or four major players its very doubtful that two have to 
merge in order to compete effectively 
what several experts believe is likely to result under the bush 
administration is a slight tightening and it is happening already 
in the last year theres been some pressure from congress and 
there have been far more investigations by the federal trade 
commission and the justice department pitofsky said 
in one recent case the ftc subpoenaed the rales brothers who 
have launched a tender offer for st louisbased interco inc on 
possible antitrust violations 
yet while a few showcase investigations might stop a merger here 
and there it will be difficult to put the toothpaste back in the 
tube as far as antitrust policy is concerned according to 
bartlett 
on the tax front the pressure for change may be more intense 
experts note that the government essentially is financing mergers 
acquisitions and leveraged buyouts by allowing companies to deduct 
the interest they pay on debt including the junk bonds that finance 
some deals 
those who fear corporate america is so deep in debt that making 
interest payments ultimately will come at the expense of spending on 
research and development are calling for changes in the tax laws 
one simple alteration would be reducing the interest deduction 
based on the amount of debt outstanding but even beryl sprinkel 
president reagans chief economic adviser was rebuffed in his 
suggestion two years ago that tax incentives be devised that favor 
stock issues over debt 
current law is further biased against equity by requiring 
corporations to pay taxes on their profits while shareholders also 
pay taxes on the dividends they receive 
bush has partially addressed the issue by proposing a reduction 
in the capital gains tax from 33 percent to 15 percent which would 
be an indirect way to encourage financing through the sale of stock 
experts say the government is likely to tread carefully on these 
issues because any change could have a dramatic effect on the stock 
market changing the way companies finance deals is likely to alter 
just how much money companies are willing to pay to acquire other 
companies 
the government doesnt want to see the stock market collapse 
if you take out the deal flavor the stock buybacks and mergers 
you could see an enormous drop in the dow jones average of 30 
industrials the key market barometer bartlett said

it was the proverbial good news and bad news for 
the edgy bond market this past week 
the governments quarterly refunding auctions went better than 
expected with yields on 3year and 10year treasury notes falling 
to the lowest levels in many months yields move in the opposite 
direction of bond prices 
but the dollars slide to fivemonth lows took a big bite out of 
that benefit by sparking fears that the federal reserve could nudge 
interest rates higher to bolster the us currency 
were seeing definitely a fear of the dollars deterioration 
said jay goldinger a principal of capital insight inc an 
investment firm in beverly hills calif 
there was even speculation about an imminent increase in the 
feds key discount rate the interest it charges on loans to 
financial institutions the talk hasnt yet escalated into disco 
fever analysts say but it makes a shaky bond market even more 
jumpy 
the market already had the jitters on account of tuesdays 
presidential election both before and after it was nervous before 
the election because of uncertainty about the outcome then bushs 
victory stirred up worries about how he would deal with critical 
problems like the budget and trade deficits and with the 
democraticcontrolled congress 
the election results are not conducive to a kinder and gentler 
bond market said david hale chief economist for kemper financial 
services in chicago paraphrasing one of bushs campaign slogans 
bond prices were driven lower by the prospect of political 
gridlock between the new republican president and the 
democratmajority congress he noted 
the treasury auctions were a bright spot on the otherwise bleak 
landscape for the bond market 
the three auctions on tuesday wednesday and thursday formed 
the governments latest quarterly bond sale to help finance the 26 
trillion national debt the issues are sold to wall streets biggest 
brokers who later sell them to the public in the secondary market 
on election day tuesday the average yield on 3year notes fell 
to 859 percent that was down from 877 percent at the last 
comparable auction on aug 9 and was the lowest rate since 3year 
notes averaged 823 percent on may 10 
the momentum was sustained on wednesday when 10year notes were 
sold at an average yield of 894 percent down from 927 percent at 
the last such auction on aug 10 rates on 10year notes havent 
been that low since they hit 821 percent on feb 3 
the auction results were pretty decent said kevin flanagan 
a money market economist at dean witter reynolds inc that gave 
us a little help 
helping the auctions in turn was the absence of the treasurys 
closely watched 30year bond 
as was the case in last quarters auction the government lacked 
the authority to issue any more long bonds however the treasury 
hopes to sell 9 billion of them later this month or in early 
december after president reagan signs an authorizing tax bill 
analysts point out that the absence of the longterm bond 
improved the auction results because its a highrisk issue and 
difficult to adjust in front of changing economic circumstances 
in addition goldinger noted it meant there simply was less 
paper to auction 
in place of the 30year bonds the treasury auctioned on thursday 
37day cash management bills they were sold at an average discount 
rate of 807 percent 
the bills are intended to help smooth the flow of government 
revenue until the treasury can issue the 30year bonds

a george bush presidency should have little impact on most 
commodities markets but the futures industry as a whole is relieved 
by the election results which appear to have weakened the forces 
favoring more regulation 
particularly cheering according to futures industry association 
president john damgard is the likelihood that rep edward markey 
dmass will get little support from the bush administration in his 
quest to place regulatory authority for stockindex futures in the 
hands of the securities and exchange commission 
all futures trading currently is overseen by the commodities 
futures trading commission which is a part of the agriculture 
department markey who did not return calls seeking an interview 
for this article has called the cftc lax in its regulatory 
approach and described it as bystander during the october 1987 
stock market crash 
an ally of defeated democratic presidential contender michael 
dukakis markey may be forced to be less ambitious or voracious in 
his attempts to transfer jurisdiction to the sec by knowing that 
george bush wont be so anxious to go along with that damgard 
said in a telephone interview from his washington office 
stockindex futures which are heavily traded on the chicago 
mercantile exchange and offered on a number of other us futures 
exchanges are hedging instruments that investors can use as 
insurance against losses in the stock market but some contend they 
encourage reckless speculation and that they contributed to the 
collapse of the stock market last year 
stockindex futures traders buy and sell baskets of stocks for 
delivery on a future date at a specified price because they are 
derived from the stock market markey and others say they should be 
regulated by the sec which oversees stock trading 
but futures industry leaders say the sec does not understand the 
futures business and they say giving the agency jurisdiction over 
stockindex futures would needlessly expand the federal bureaucracy 
the futures industry says its relentless lobbying on the issue 
has won them an invaluable ally in treasury secretary nicholas 
brady who headed the postcrash panel that recommended better 
coordination of the stock and stockindex futures markets 
i basically see a friend in the treasury department for the 
futures industry damgard said 
futures industry leaders also say they expect bush to retain 
wendy gramm an opponent of additional regulation as chairwoman 
of the cftc and there are murmurings that sec chairman david ruder 
who has sought sec jurisdiction over stockindex futures will be 
replaced 
the issue is expected to come to a head next year when the cftc 
comes up for recertification 
here is how bushs election likely will affect various 
commodities markets 
precious metals i think the gold market will be watching what 
bush does and how the currency markets react to it said john 
norris chief precious metals trader with citibank in new york 
analysts said continued weakness in the dollar could lead to higher 
inflation and higher metals prices but the federal reserve could 
counterbalance those effects by raising interest rates 
grains and soybeans nothing said cathy leow vice 
president of grain and soybean trading with thomson mckinnon 
securities inc in new york therell be no change in policies in 
the short term and so there should be no change in the market 
livestock and meat it doesnt really change anything said 
charles levitt senior livestock market analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc in chicago 
energy very little said james ritterbusch vice president 
of trading and research with the carson petroleum co a 
chicagoarea oil distributor any domestic us energy policy 
shifts will be easily outweighed by international factors namely 
opec overproduction thats the key factor in this market at the 
present time

winstonsalem nc ap a grandson of tobacco company founder 
rj reynolds has accused rjr nabisco inc executives of trying to 
amass personal fortunes through the bidding war for the tobacco and 
consumer products giant 
it is clear that the purpose of this transaction is to make a 
large profit for these executives by selling off certain of the 
companys businesses and assets and by taking other steps to 
restructure and increase the profitability and value of the 
company smith w bagley said in a letter to charles hugel 
chairman of a special committee reviewing bids for the conglomerate 
bagley an heir to the reynolds tobacco fortune said the letter 
was written on behalf of himself and certain other stockholders of 
rjr nabisco 
last month rjr nabisco president f ross johnson announced a plan 
to take the company private in a 17 billion leveraged buyout if 
the group were successful he and other top executives could end up 
owning 20 percent of the company published reports have said that 
equity would be worth several billion dollars 
johnson has denied claims the management group would be 
excessively compensated in such a buyout 
bagley who is a substantial stockholder in rjr nabisco outlined 
steps he said the company took to pave the way for the management 
buyout plan including 
rjr nabiscos purchase in april of 21 million shares for 5350 
each the companys stock currently is trading in the 89ashare 
range 
the adoption of a poison pill defense to thwart outside 
bidders not acceptable to management 
the preparation at stockholder expense of financial studies 
analyses and projections concerning a restructuring of the company 
and the sale of certain businesses 
bagley said the management group tried to discourage bidding by 
the buyout firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which launched a 
2023 billion tender offer and by a group led by forstmann little 
amp co which has expressed interest in making an offer 
for the executive management of this company to devise a 
plan to take the company private and to divert for themselves 
profits properly accruing to the public stockholders and then to 
undermine competitive bidding would be selfdealing and a breach of 
fiduciary duty he said 
the stockholders have been paying these top executives and 
paying them handsomely to run the company for the stockholders 
benefit and not to acquire it at the stockholders expense 
a spokesman for rjr nabisco declined to comment on the letter

corn and soybean futures closed substantially 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade amid disappointment over 
the slow pace of export sales of those commodities 
but wheat futures finished mixed amid indications of growing 
foreign demand for us wheat 
technical factors keyed to thursdays late collapse in the 
soybean and corn markets also contributed to the selloff friday in 
those markets 
we were down so much yesterday and we just saw some 
followthrough from that said jon horton a market analyst with 
research department inc in chicago 
thursdays declines were said to have stemmed mainly from 
bearishly interpreted pricechart formations but some observers 
said the drop in prices may have indicated that a rumored sale of 2 
million metric tons of us corn to the soviet union had not been 
completed 
that view reflected the markets disappointment that last weeks 
sale to the soviets of a large amount of us soybeans had not been 
followed by more large soviet purchases 
the grain markets rallied last week in anticipation of more sales 
and were just coming down from that horton said 
at the close wheat was 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 422 a bushel corn was 5 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 269 a bushel oats 
were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 212 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cents to 12 cents lower with november at 762 a 
bushel

increased coke production at usx corps 
clairton works should be allowed only if the company reduces air 
pollution to safe levels two environmental groups say 
the residents against chemical environment and the group against 
smog and pollution said thursday that usx shouldnt be allowed to 
fire up two rebuilt coke batteries without first cutting emissions 
from the 10 batteries now in operation 
the two new batteries would create 175 new fulltime jobs the 
batteries contain ovens to bake coal to produce coke an ingredient 
used in making steel the clairton works in the nations largest 
coke plant 
certainly a corporation with the resources of usx is capable 
of making coke in a safe manner and they should be required to do 
so said gasp president walter goldburg 
the allegheny county health department said air monitoring showed 
levels of fine inhalable particles downwind from the plant exceeded 
government standards on 12 occasions in the past year also levels 
of benzene a toxic pollutant have averaged nearly 10 times a 
proposed state guideline for the chemical 
paul masciantonio vice president of environmental affairs for 
usxs uss division said company consultants reveal no evidence the 
factory is causing health problems 
he said the company is installing additional air pollution 
controls at a cost of about 30 million under a federal court 
consent decree

the december contracts dramatic recovery from a 545cent 
decline early in the session suggested the bull market for copper 
may not be over despite thursdays steep losses of nearly 9 cents a 
pound analysts said 
the fact that the market closed so much off its lows today on 
friday when you normally would get a lot of nervous selling ahead 
of the weekend is very constructive said bernard savaiko metals 
market analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
thursdays decline was sparked by reports that the southern peru 
copper co the largest coppermining firm in the worlds 
sixthlargest copperproducing nation had come to contract terms 
with some of its nonmining employees 
it appeared on thursday that a settlement with the miners also 
was imminent but on friday southern peru miners reportedly 
rejected the companys offer of substantial wage increases 
the miners want to have a united front they want a united 
mine workers union and they want a nationwide settlement savaiko 
said 
the peruvian strike has been a major factor in spot coppers rise 
from about 1 a pound in august to the recent record high of 1538 
but copper supplies have been growing tighter for about 1 years 
and that situation is expected to continue 
with the peruvian picture turning muddy traders were looking

7000metricton decline in its copper stocks in the past week

the soviet union signed a preliminary agreement 
friday with a japaneseled consortium in a deal that could lead to 
the building of a huge petrochemical complex in western siberia 
the project if completed would be one of the largest joint 
ventures the soviets have entered into with foreign companies since 
liberalized regulations were implemented last year to make such 
undertakings possible 
mitsubishi corp a major japanese trading company that is the 
lead company in the consortium estimated the cost at 5 billion 
japans kyodo news service said 
the award to the mitsubishiled consortium was a setback for 
occidental petroleum corp of los angeles which had announced in 
june it was putting together a consortium of western chemical 
companies to do the project at the request of the soviet government 
the japanese offered such attractive terms that the project was 
awarded to them frank ashley an occidental spokesman said in a 
statement friday attributed to the companys chairman armand 
hammer occidental later said the company did not know the terms of 
the japanese offer 
occidental said it was still leading two other big petrochemical 
projects in the soviet union 
located in the area of the nizhnevartovsk oil fields 1500 miles 
east of moscow the proposed complex would include 15 highly 
automated factories capable of annual production of up to 1 million 
tons of chemical products including structural materials and 
polymers the official soviet news agency tass said 
the products would be used in the space aircraftbuilding 
automobile eletrical engineering and other industries tass said 
tass said the agreement called for the soviets and the foreign 
group to complete by the end of march a feasibility study on 
building the complex 
plans call for the complex if it is authorized to be completed 
by the year 2000 
also in the consortium along with mitsubishi are chiyoda corp 
and mitsui and co of japan 
there were conflicting reports late friday about whether 
combustion engineering inc of stamford conn was involved in the 
consortium i cant tell you whether were in or out admitted 
mark baxter a company spokesman 
another planned chemical complex in tobolsk would supply the 
intermediate materials for the new complex kyodo said 
feasibility studies for the tobolsk project are already being 
conducted by a consortium made up of combustion engineering 
mcdermott international inc of the united states and mitsubishi 
and mitsui kyodo said it said that project could cost 10 billion 
the soviet government hopes to finish construction of the two 
projects by the end of the 1990s and plans to export at least 40 
percent of their products to earn foreign exchange kyodo said 
western governments and businesses have expressed concern that 
the anticipated soviet exports could depress world prices for some 
petrochemical products 
the soviet union has hoped to involve japan more in the economic 
development of siberia which has rich deposits of oil and natural 
gas 
the agreement of intent was signed in moscow by soviet chemical 
industry minister yuri bespalov and takeshi egyshi managing 
director of mitsubishi corp tass said 
tass said the complex would cost 5 billion rubles that is about 
8 billion at official exchange rates but less in terms of the 
actual value of the ruble 
ollar values are difficult to calculate because the ruble is not 
convertible into other currencies accounting for the differences in 
the statements by tass and kyodo 
occidental still is involved in a proposed venture to build a 
petrochemical complex at the soviet city of tengiz near the caspian 
sea along with the italian companies montedison spa and ente 
nazionale idrocarburi and japans marubeni corp a feasibility 
project on that is expected to be completed early in 1989 
occidentals other soviet project is with the ministry of 
chemical industry for a polyvinyl chloride plant at kalush near the 
czechoslovak border

a washington utility has agreed to a 
settlement for its part in the washington public power supply system 
securities fraud case leaving only three private companies as 
defendants in the twomonthold trial 
in agreeing late thursday to settle the snohomish county public 
utility district joined 14 other washington state utilities who 
reached a 226 million settlement with wppss bondholders last week 
the agreement also takes chemical bank of new york out of the 
case chemical a trustee for bondholders sued only the utilities 
a class of more than 24000 past and present bondholders sued all 
the defendants 
us district court judge browning who is presiding over the 
case is expected to sign an order monday that will formally cut 
snohomish and chemical bank from the case 
he still must hold fairness hearings on the settlements involving 
snohomish and others that were reached before the trial started if 
he rules against the settlements the parties could end up back in 
court retrying the case 
snohomishs action leaves three defendants a financial advisory 
firm and two engineering companies in the case brought on by 
wppss default on 225 billion in municipal bonds in 1983 after the 
system scrapped two unfinished nuclear power plants 
the snohomish settlement calls for the utility to pay 486 
million in turn the plaintiffs will pay it 26 million to retain 
the rights to about 20 million in disputed insurance claims 
snohomish will pay about 35 million for each percentage point 
of its 13percent share of the plants 
a group of 14 other washington state utilities settled out of 
court oct 31 for 181 million or about 37 million for each 
percentage point 
as part of that agreement the federal bonneville power 
administration agreed to add 35 million and washington state will 
add 10 million subject to legislative approval 
settlements of about 650 million have been pledged to 
bondholders by more than 100 original defendants in the case 
wppss reached a settlement that requires no monetary awards 
paul bernstein another attorney for the class plaintiffs said 
the latest settlement does not affect its case against the remaining 
defendants 
the plaintiffs maintain that the defendants conspired to lie and 
hide information that might have discouraged bond investors 
financial adviser blyth eastman painewebber inc faces the same 
allegations as did the utilities bernstein said separate 
allegations were made against the two engineering firms ebasco 
services inc and united engineers and contractors inc
