the first school of jewish studies in the soviet 
union since the time of stalin will open officially in moscow this 
wednesday says a professor who plans to lecture there 
the opening of the yeshiva which will train rabbis and scholars 
represents a historic event said david berger a history professor 
at brooklyn college here it marks the first time in 60 years that 
the soviet government has allowed the study of jewish law 
berger said anyone who might have suggested an academy of jewish 
studies in the soviet union five years ago would have been locked 
up 
he said the yeshiva will be independent of the government 
they are not controlling the faculty at all the professor 
said all of us are completely independent they are not as far 
as i know controlling the student body either 
the judaic studies center which will occupy an apartment complex 
owned by the soviet academy of sciences is a joint project of the 
academy and rabbi adin steinsaltz a noted israeli scholar 
the soviet government will provide stipends for the students 
financial support will also come from the aleph society a group of 
philanthropists that supports steinsaltz in his other work berger 
said 
between 75 and 80 students will study at the center the course 
of instruction will include the bible jewish law and jewish 
history the first semester will last seven weeks future semesters 
will last four months 
berger said that some of the students many of whom are in 
university or have graduated have managed to get a substantial 
quantity of jewish knowledge he suggested that some of the 
students may have studied or taught hebrew in clandestine classes 
the availability of books may present a problem according to 
berger the basic library is being brought from israel he said 
in addition to steinsaltz and berger the faculty will include 
rabbis from chicago and jerusalem 
official attitudes toward jews and jewish culture in the soviet 
union have become more liberal recently last week the first 
officially approved jewish cultural center in the soviet union 
opened in moscow 
jewish emigration from the soviet union has increased and israel 
and russia have exchanged consular officials

mikhail s gorbachevs flirtation with 
the west appears to have captured the hearts of europeans but their 
governments have not yet made up their minds whether to give in on 
defense spending 
overall military expenditures by the united states allies in the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization are likely to rise a 
bit this year 
however gorbachevs dramatic announcements of defense and troop 
reductions were made only recently and analysts say their impact if 
any will not likely show up until budget planners get to work in 
coming months 
western officials have so far praised the soviet leaders 
promises of reform but also urged caution in modifying their own 
defense plans 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain has said while we 
wish mr gorbachev well we nevertheless have to keep our defenses 
strong so that whatever may happen freedom and justice and 
democracy in the west will remain secure 
premier michel rocard of france recently urged the greatest 
prudence until promises to reshape and cut back on soviet military 
might are carried out canadas external affairs minister joe 
clark said the west still must face formidable and 
everimproving soviet forces 
us gen john galvin natos top military commander in europe 
cautioned in a recent interview there is some dangerous thinking 
going on in nato that there has been a big military change in 
the soviet union 
we should be careful about our perceptions of how things are 
today in terms of our security lets keep our powder dry 
john cross deputy director of the international institute for 
strategic studies in london doubted governments will cut military 
spending its more likely for the moment that the improved 
climate would be advanced as a reason for not doing more than for 
than scaling back 
a nato official however expressed concern its going to get 
harder to get parliaments to allocate the money necessary for 
defense said the official who demanded anonymity 
defense spending for the united states allies will edge up 07 
percent this year according to nato forecasts whereas last years 
spending was off an estimated 05 percent 
us defense spending soared from 1980 to 1986 but has since 
eased president bush proposed a 3088 billion military budget for 
the 1990 fiscal year holding outlays at current levels after 
inflation 
in the late 1970s the united states pressed nato for a 3 percent 
annual increase in each countrys defense budget a sum that became 
a rough guide for measuring military expenditures 
but most nato governments have not met that goal and some us 
lawmakers contend the europeans are not paying enough for their own 
defense 
this question of burdensharing may become more troublesome 
as europeans view the threat of an attack from the sovietled warsaw 
pact as less likely gorbachev appears to be immensely popular in 
europe 
in britain a harris poll for the observer a liberal weekly 
newspaper found 60 percent of voters questioned said gorbachev 
would make a greater contribution to world peace and 18 percent 
picked bush the rest didnt know 
west germans also have taken to the soviet leader a recent 
survey by the emnid firm found the weakest commitment to defense 
spending in 26 years 
yet neither chancellor helmut kohl nor his foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher has urged less money for defense indeed 
military expenditures are projected to go up 14 percent this year 
after 03 percent decline in 1988 
italys defense spending also is expected to climb this year up 
08 percent after falling about 11 percent 
in france the military budget is projected to rise 12 percent 
this year above last years 05 percent increase 
british defense expenditures are forecast to slump 07 percent 
this year they tumbled some 31 percent last year 
greece with its defense budget soaring roughly 10 percent last 
year may expand spending by only 06 percent this year though 
premier andreas papandreou has backed gorbachevs peace efforts 
this government based on its fixed policy in favor of peace 
and disarmament can only praise every initiative in this 
direction he said after the soviet leader announced troops cuts 
in a december speech at the united nations 
in turkey the soviet union once feared as having designs on its 
territory has acquired a more benign image 
one of two nato countries bordering the soviet union turkey has 
600000 men under arms the largest armed forces in the alliance 
after the united states its military spending was forecast to go up 
33 percent this year following an approximate 34 percent gain in 
1988 
norway the other nato nation with a soviet border is likely to 
raise its defense budget 19 percent this year after a 13 percent 
decline last year 
foreign minister thorvald stoltenberg said gorbachevs un 
speech reflected innovative thinking but he added there is 
no reduction of military buildup on the soviet side in northern 
areas 
foreign minister uffe ellemannjensen of denmark complained that 
the kremlin has done nothing about warsaw pact forces along the 
baltic 
the buildup he said is a serious threatwhich rhymes poorly 
with desires to ease tensions and create confidence in europe 
denmarks defense spending was projected to slip 22 percent this 
year after climbing 28 percent in 1988 
other nato spending forecasts for this year were belgium down 
44 percent canada up 29 percent luxembourg up 99 percent the 
netherlands up 07 percent portugal up 3 percent and spain up 
04 percent 
iceland the 16th nation in nato has no military forces

secretary of state james a baker iii accused 
iran of statesponsored terrorism in the death threat against 
novelist salman rushdie 
the united states continues to oppose terrorism in all of its 
forms in particular statesponsored terrorism baker said sunday 
on the nbctv meet the press program 
rushdie has said he did not intend to insult fellow moslems in 
his novel the satanic verses however iranian leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini on sunday refused to accept the apology and said 
rushdie still should be killed 
bakers comments follow statements by president bush in his first 
weeks in office indicating the administrations desire to improve 
relations with iran 
but baker said in the interview if iran really is serious 
about rejoining the community of civilized nations this is not the 
kind of behavior that leads to that 
this is behavior that is basically intolerable he said 
just back from meeting us allies in europe baker also said in 
the wideranging interview that 
us and west german officials are not at odds over statements 
by chancellor helmut kohl that he cannot decide whether to support 
the modernization of nato landbased nuclear missiles in europe 
until after elections in 1990 
the bush administration is withholding immediate judgment of a 
tentative central american agreement to disband nicaraguas contra 
guerrillas in return for commitment by that nations leftist 
sandinista government to hold free elections and stop meddling in 
the affairs of its neighbors 
the united states will work with other members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization on nuclear force modernization seeking 
to reach a consensus before a planned nato summit in late may baker 
said 
i found no one during the course of this trip who did not feel 
that we should maintain a landbased nuclear missile in 
europe baker said 
he stressed that he had not expected a commitment on the issue 
from the west germans where popular opinion favors removal of all 
nuclear weapons 
we understand the delicateness of the issue from their 
standpoint said baker there is no disagreement we have our 
view i firmly believe that we will be able to work this out 
satisfactorily between now and the end of may 
notwithstanding the central american agreement said baker we 
have at the very least a moral obligation to seek humanitarian aid 
for the contras when it expires on march 31 and i believe that 
president bush has indicated that he would be doing so 
there are some elements to the agreement that look promising 
the idea of democratization in nicaragua the idea of 
noninterference by nicaragua in the affairs of its neighbors but 
of course these are promises that nicaragua has made before said 
baker 
there needs to be some sort of enforcement mechanism to 
make sure that the sandinistas keep the promises they have already 
made he said

president bushs visit to japan this week comes 
as the stormy relations brought on by trade frictions between the 
worlds two largest economies have subsided 
the us trade deficit with japan the united states main ally 
in asia remains more than 50 billion a year has begun inching 
downward and the relationship between the us dollar and the 
japanese yen appears to be at a stable level 
things are rather harmonious at the moment said john 
williamson an analyst at the institute for international economics 
the united states is pleased with the recent steps taken by 
japan the japanese may not be as pleased with us progress on 
lowering the budget deficit but not so much that it will be an area 
of particular friction williamson said 
the japanese see the bulging us budget deficit expected to be 
about 160 billion as a major cause of the trade imbalance between 
the two nations partly because it prompts a heavy inflow of foreign 
cash into us investments to help finance the shortfall while 
sapping us capital needed for private investment 
japan has promised to import more goods from the rest of the 
world and the united states has promised to work to lower its 
budget deficit these joint goals were reaffirmed in the meeting 
earlier this month between president bush and japanese prime 
minister noboru takeshita 
takeshita was the first foreign leader bush invited to the white 
house 
and while they werent quite on the firstname basis that former 
president reagan and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone enjoyed 
and trumpeted they parted company with upbeat predictions of even 
better usjapan relations in the years to come 
after the two met for nearly three hours on feb 2 bush declared 
that differences between the two countries were the differences of 
friends and takeshita heralded a new start of usjapan 
cooperation 
the funeral of emperor hirohito the stated purpose of bushs 
first overseas trip as president seemed likely to keep takeshita 
preoccupied and analysts said they do not expect much in the way of 
usjapanese policy discussions during bushs stay in japan 
in fact bush planned to spend much of his time there meeting 
with other world leaders he has scheduled more than a dozen such 
bilateral sessions during his twoday visit 
bushs decision to meet with other leaders during the funeral 
visit irritated some japanese officials part of bushs decision to 
invite takeshita to washington first analysts suggest was an 
effort to smooth over any hurt feelings on this score 
a senior administration official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said bush would keep his meeting with other heads of 
state lowkey while in tokyo 
they will not offend protocol as long as theyre done 
quietly the official said he said that state funerals have 
become a place where lots of people get together 
while usjapanese relations are generally good there are still 
some sore points among them 
computer chips us semiconductor manufacturers continue to 
complain that japan isnt opening its markets adequately to their 
products despite a 1986 agreement calling for such 
rice sales the reagan administration complained repeatedly of 
japans virtual ban on accepting foreigngrown rice the bush 
administration is expected to pursue these complaints largely on 
behalf of california rice growers 
jet fighters the bush administration has delayed until after 
the asian trip a decision on whether to honor a reagan 
administration agreement with japan for a joint jetfighter project 
under the agreement general dynamics of the united states and 
japans mitsubishi heavy industry would join forces to build 
socalled fsx jet fighters a new version of the f16 fighter 
critics in congress have labeled the project an 8 billion giveaway 
of us high technology and have called on bush to cancel us 
participation 
the japanese government says it needs a final goahead from the 
united states by march 31 to get funds for the project into its 
current budget 
defense spending some us leaders including defense 
secretarydesignate john tower have complained recently that japan 
has not been contributing enough to its own defense bush touched on 
this subject indirectly saying i noted the importance of allies 
assuming greater responsibilities in the cause of peace the prime 
minister and i agreed that these responsibilities take many forms 
third world aid japans efforts to spend more money in aid to 
third world nations was received coolly by the reagan 
administration which irritated some japanese leaders however the 
bush administration has been more receptive toward the idea 
praising japans recent commitment for a 78 percent increase in its 
budget for such aid japan has vowed to spend 50 billion in aid to 
the developing nations from 1988 to 1992 
japan also has proposed a new way of speeding up trade disputes 
with the united states through establishment of a special oversight 
panel of highlevel us and japanese officials 
us response has been lukewarm we do have very good 
mechanisms right now said gaston j sigur assistant secretary of 
state for east asian and pacific affairs 
however sigur said the united states remains open to any new 
suggestions on solving trade disputes and will give the plan 
serious study

a study in which students carried electronic 
beepers and recorded their feelings when buzzed provided an unusual 
glimpse into the adolescent psyche and indicates some stereotypes 
are false researchers say 
university of illinois and loyola university researchers gave 
beepers to 480 students in grades five to nine in suburbs southwest 
of chicago and asked them to write down their thoughts when buzzed 
every two hours or so 
the results 20000 musings on adolescent concerns ranging from 
television to love including the finding that most youths felt best 
doing sports and worst doing homework 
we hope that this study will not merely be 20000 individual 
snapshots but rather a motion picture of what life as an adolescent 
is actually like the researchers write in an article accepted for 
publication in the journal child development this september 
contrary to the popular image of musiccrazed adolescents glued 
to their stereos girls who took part in the study reported 
listening to music only 18 hours a week compared with 12 hours a 
week among boys 
overall girls spent more time studying talking and grooming and 
less time watching television than boys the study found 
but regardless of sex or age the participants didnt appear to 
enjoy television much reporting average or belowaverage moods 
while watching it the researchers said 
ninthgraders said they were in bad moods about 11 percent of the 
time compared to 6 percent for fifthgraders by contrast the 
younger students reported feeling great 25 percent of the time 
compared to 12 percent among the ninthgraders 
the older teenagers face more difficulties as they move into 
junior high school and the dating life said university of 
illinois researcher reed larson they become less naive and more 
aware that life isnt all roses 
his colleague loyola psychologist maryse richards said the 
study provides a more accurate portrait than traditional research in 
which subjects are interviewed or asked to fill out questionnaires 
about past events or feelings 
memories can play tricks when people try to recall exact details 
of their lives ms richards said 
students carried beepers between 1985 and 1987 and the 
researchers plan a followup on the same students next year 
the researchers said some of their findings were more surprising 
than others 
as expected older youths reported feeling in love more often 
than younger students but sports got high marks as a favored 
activity for all age groups 
kids feel better doing sports than just about any other 
activity ms richards said they feel most energized happy and 
cheerful 
girls did about seven hours a week of homework while boys did 
about six she said of all their activities they feel worst 
while doing homework ms richards said 
about 30 percent of eighth and ninthgrade girls were

nursing home owners say a new federal law that 
is aimed at assuring care for mentally ill and mentally retarded 
patients may instead force these people into the streets 
the law which went into effect jan 1 is designed to prevent 
warehousing of mentally ill and mentally retarded patients in 
nursing homes and assure that they get the specialized treatment 
they need 
nursing homes are being told they will lose medicaid funds if 
they accept patients who suffer from mental illness or mental 
retardation unless they also need nursing care because the homes 
dont offer such specialized services 
ostensibly this law is out to do a good thing but it simply 
will not work given the reality of whats available paul 
willging executive vice president of the american health care 
association which represents nursing homes said 
it will mean great numbers of homeless mentally ill and 
mentally retarded people he said 
willging estimates that 5 percent to 10 percent of the nations 
15 million patients in medicaidcertified nursing homes are 
mentally ill or mentally retarded 
government officials say the nursing homes warnings are off base 
and advocates for the mentally ill and mentally retarded who 
supported the law say they have no evidence that people are being 
turned out into the streets 
terry coleman deputy administrator of the federal health care 
financing administration said the law is an effort to get states 
to develop additional programs for the mentally retarded and 
mentally ill like small group homes and communitybased services 
historically it has been the states responsibility to fund 
services and facilities for the mentally ill he said to avoid this 
cost however some states have channeled these patients into 
nursing homes where medicaid picks up the tab for those who are 
poor 
states more often have special facilities for the mentally 
retarded because medicaid funding is available for these but 
nursing home care is often cheaper 
asked whether the law would result in more homeless people 
coleman said it may if the states refuse to develop new 
programs 
adding to the outcry is the health care financing 
administrations delay in putting regulations in place to guide 
states and nursing homes in implementing the law regulations wont 
be ready until spring but states and nursing homes still must 
comply with the terms of the law in the meantime 
there is enormous confusion said sara speights spokeswoman 
for the texas health care association which is trying to block 
implementation of the law in court a lot of cases are unclear a 
lot of people are on medications a lot have had strokes and are 
depressed is this considered a mental illness 
critics also fear that while the law does not consider 
alzheimers disease a mental illness some alzheimers patients may 
be wrongly classified and turned away 
other lawsuits have been filed in idaho where a temporary 
restraining order blocking implementation has been issued and in 
louisiana 
willging said that while the concept of the law is wonderful 
most states dont have enough alternative facilities to handle the 
number of people that could be turned away from nursing homes by the 
law 
nursing homes have much at stake under the new law more than 40 
percent of the nations nursing home costs are borne by the 
federalstate medicaid program the healthcare association said 
nursing homes provide good healthcare services willging 
said its true that nursing homes dont specialize in active 
treatment for the mentally ill and mentally retarded but isnt 
it a darn sight better than shipping people out to where they wont 
get any services whatsoever 
joe manes senior policy analyst with the mental health law 
project an advocacy group for the mentally ill and mentally 
retarded said the nursing homes outcry is selfserving 
what theyre afraid of is they arent going to get paid he 
said 
other groups that represent the mentally ill and mentally 
retarded are cautiously monitoring implementation of the law 
we are nervous but we dont want our people to be placed in 
nursing homes if they cant get the services they need said chris 
koyanagi of the national mental health association they have been 
warehoused in nursing homes simply because federal reimbursement 
has been available

david ernest duke insists he is not a racist 
but the exgrand wizard of the knights of the ku klux klan and the 
nazi of lsu has had a difficult time convincing his detractors 
his successful campaign for a seat in the louisiana house of 
representatives representing a nearly allwhite district in 
suburban new orleans drew cries of outrage and dollars of support 
from around the country 
republicans showed no alarm at his decision to join the gop two 
days before qualifying to run for the house seat until it looked 
like he might win the heavyweights president bush and former 
president reagan endorsed his opponent metairie homebuilder john 
treen 
moments after duke was narrowly elected saturday republican 
chairman lee atwater moved to bar the man from the bearing the 
partys name 
it didnt matter to the jubilant state representative who does 
he think he is the people have spoken duke said 
duke 38 started courting controversy early when he joined the 
ku klux klan as a teenager in college he was known as the nazi 
of lsu and was photographed wearing a nazi uniform and carrying 
sign that said gas the chicago 7 
he sharpened his oratory at louisiana state universitys free 
speech alley a public forum where he expressed his antiblack 
antijewish views and evolved during his 20s into an articulate 
spokesman for the ku klux klan 
it was a new unmasked klan and he was the leader engaged in 
family activities wearing salon haircuts and exhibiting 
outspokenness about topics once the purview of hooded night riders 
but in 1980 duke split with klan leader bill wilkinson who 
accused him of trying to sell secret membership lists he started 
his own organization a white civil rights group called the 
national association for the advancement of white people 
last week he said he had some remorse about his time with the 
kkk 
i regret it because people might think im racially or 
religiously intolerant duke said 
and many believe he still is treen called the charismatic 
candidate a master of deception who was spreading his nazi 
venom across the united states 
duke ran for president in 1988 and didnt make a ripple on 
election graphs he tried first as a democrat a party which barred 
him from their headquarters and then made a move to the populist 
party hiring examerican nazi leader ralph forbes of arkansas as 
his campaign manager 
his name was on 15 state ballots and he polled 48000 votes 
about onehalf of 1 percent of the nationwide tally 
his bid for the state house started off much better on jan 21 
he shocked observers by leading a sevencandidate field with 33 
percent of the vote word spread quickly that louisiana just might 
send a man who once presided over cross burnings to its legislature 
as the international spotlight turned to metairie articles 
connected to duke reappeared such as the naawp news piece that 
suggested dividing the united states into different countries for 
citizens of certain ethnic backgrounds 
other past events were highlighted once more such as the time in 
1976 when duke and a companion in blackface disrupted the unveiling 
of a bust of pbs pinchback a black man who served briefly as 
governor of louisiana during reconstruction 
british bobbies tried to oust him as an undesirable during a 
visit to england in 1978 but he always seemed to outfox scotland 
yard showing up untouched for interviews and cross burnings 
duke has been arrested at least twice once in jefferson parish 
for inciting a riot in 1978 and once in 1987 during a demonstration 
in forsyth county ga he was sentenced to six months in jail on the 
jefferson parish case and received a suspended oneyear sentence in 
georgia on condition he stay out of the state for a year 
he used the record as a symbol of reverse discrimination saying 
blacks who demonstrate are called civil rights activists while 
whites are called racists

sirhan sirhan in his first television interview 
called sen robert f kennedy his hero but said he killed the 
presidential candidate more than 20 years ago because he felt 
betrayed by kennedys support for israel 
i was not doing it out of personal malice towards the man but 
out of concern for other people said sirhan who likened 
kennedys assassination to a jew killing adolf hitler robert 
kennedy represented a threat to arabs by his support of the arabs 
enemies 
sirhan 44 is serving a life sentence in state prison at 
soledad calif and comes up for parole in may 
the hourlong interview at the prison with david frost for the 
syndicated program inside edition was shown to reporters sunday 
and is to be broadcast in segments tonight tuesday and wednesday 
sirhan apologized repeatedly for killing kennedy then the 
frontrunner for the democratic presidential nomination 
he was my hero sirhan said he was my champion he was the 
protector and the defender of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged 
i cant say anything except that i am totally sorry and feel nothing 
but remorse for having caused that tragic death 
but when kennedy gave a speech favoring the provision of us 
fighter jets to israel that seemed as though it were a 
betrayal said sirhan a jordanian immigrant he said kennedy 
exercised a double standard by favoring peace in vietnam and the 
sale of arms to israel at the same time 
sirhan said murder is not an accepted way to settle political 
differences but he added imagine if you were a german or a jew 
in hitlers germany and if you had the opportunity to assassinate 
hitler im sure that you would have tried to do that 
frost replied there is no comparison between hitler and 
kennedy 
sirhan agreed agreed but the principle in sorts seems to 
be similar 
kennedy was shot in the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 
5 1968 moments after he claimed victory in californias democratic 
presidential primary as he has before sirhan insisted that he 
acted alone 
sirhans death sentence was changed to life imprisonment when the 
state supreme court outlawed the death penalty in 1972 and he 
became eligible for parole in 1975 he has been turned down for 
release nine times 
after his last parole rejection sirhan said he believed the only 
way he will leave prison is in a coffin 
in the interview sirhan said he had renewed hopes of release but 
accused the california board of prison terms of putting political 
considerations before the law in denying him parole 
sirhan has given other interviews but this was the first in 
which he agreed to be recorded for broadcast said the producers of 
inside edition

relatives of the people killed in 
the bombing of flight 103 banded together to push for a 
congressional investigation and tighter airport security 
by us coming together were going to try to prevent this from 
happening to other families said bonnie oconnor 
oconnors brother john ahern 26 of rockville center ny 
was aboard the boeing 747 jumbo jet when it blew up dec 21 over 
lockerbie scotland killing all 259 aboard and 11 people on the 
ground 
seventyfive to 100 relatives many with photographs of lost 
loved ones pinned to their chests attended a meeting sunday in 
this city 10 miles west of new york city at a restaurant owned by a 
victims relative they formed the victims of pan am flight 103 
committee 
if we dont organize ourselves in an effective way it will 
be very difficult to go forward said paul hudson an attorney and 
former counsel to the new york state crime victims compensation 
board who started the network of families his daughter melina 16 
was on the flight 
weve come to assist each other in our grief hudson said 
the committee will give support and aid to grieving relatives and 
lobby for a congressional investigation of the bombing said bill 
ammerman whose brother tom died in the crash 
some committee members already have met with their lawmakers 
including us sens daniel moynihan dny al damato rny 
and bill bradley dnj 
last week officials announced that the terrorists bomb that 
destroyed the boeing 747 jumbo jet had been traced to a portable 
radio stored among the luggage 
airline security procedures are far less than what is required 
to give confidence in the security of the system hudson said 
the group will campaign for stronger security including 
installation of devices that detect plastic explosives like those 
believed responsible for downing flight 103 
the relatives approved a resolution calling for the resignation 
of paul bremer us ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism for 
saying that flight crews and passengers do not need to know about 
all bomb threats 
bremer told the house foreign affairs committee earlier this 
month that announcing all threats would encourage copycat 
terrorist threats 
he also said the state department will make sure any airline 
travel warning issued to government employees about terrorist 
threats also goes to the general public bremer said the american 
embassy in moscow violated policy in posting a warning about pan 
american flights eight days before the bombing of flight 103 
the committee also wants major international airlines to make 
public their policies regarding bomb threats 
jane davis of shelton conn whose daughter shannon was aboard 
the flight said she agrees with the groups purpose but also wants 
members to remember to make sure that any terrorists responsible for 
the bombing are punished 
im very much in search of justice but not retribution said 
mrs davis whose daughter would have turned 20 on sunday

just days after antiapartheid 
leaders disowned winnie mandela over allegations her bodyguards 
killed a young black police raided her home arrested four men and 
reportedly found bloodstains 
staterun radio south africa said the four men arrested in 
sundays predawn raid were bodyguards of the wife of jailed african 
national congress leader nelson mandela 
we have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be 
sorted out in the laboratory said maj gen jaap joubert who is 
leading the investigation into the murder of 14yearold black 
activist stompie seipei 
he said police would try to prove in court that some young men 
belonging to the socalled mandela united football club whose 
members live at mrs mandelas home and act as her bodyguards had 
assaulted the boy who died 
three soweto men who are represented by an antiapartheid 
attorney have said club members abducted them and seipei and beat 
the four at the mandela house they claim mrs mandela was 
involved but have not elaborated 
mrs mandela declined to answer reporters questions on the 
police raid she has suggested the whole case results from an effort 
to discredit her 
speaking of the raid joubert said this is a thorough search 
of the premises where the alleged attacks and assaults took place 
according to witnesses seipeis body was found last month with a 
slit throat dumped in soweto the sprawling black township outside 
johannesburg 
the scandal over mrs mandelas bodyguards has seriously damaged 
the credibility of a woman who had been at the forefront of the 
fight to end white minority rule in south africa 
her husband jailed for 37 years is the countrys most revered 
black nationalist leader 
on thursday major antiapartheid leaders repudiated mrs mandela 
because of her association with the soccer club the president of 
the exiled african national congress also publicly criticized her 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches told a news conference saturday that mrs 
mandela had decided to remove the bodyguards from her home at her 
husbands instruction 
police released a videotape of their raid on the mandela house 
it showed officers without gloves searching trunks of clothing 
leafing through photograph albums and collections of anc literature 
and lifting up what appeared to be bloodsoaked sneakers a knife 
and a pair of gardening shears 
authorities also removed clubs and whips 
the camera focused on spots on the walls of rooms where the 
detained men lived radio south africa said the spots were 
bloodstains 
mrs mandela 54 has denied being at home when the three men and 
seipei brought there but she has defended their abduction and said 
they probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged 
homosexual activities at the methodist church residence where they 
lived the church denies her allegations 
joubert said one of those detained during the 4 am raid was 
jerry richardson identified as the clubs coach others arrested at 
the house were not named but radio south africa said they were mrs 
mandelas bodyguards 
the policeman said authorities also arrested two other men 
elsewhere in soweto who will be charged with murdering sowetos dr 
abu baker asvat community leaders have told newspapers that asvat 
examined seipei after he was beaten mrs mandela said asvat was a 
witness to her charges of sexual abuse 
police also raided five other locations connected with mrs 
mandela including the home of a freelance journalist joubert 
said he did not identify the others 
the alarm went off and dogs barked as policemen entered mrs 
mandelas property according to the film it shows mrs mandela 
her daughter zindzi and grandchildren in their bathrobes 
richardson was filmed in his underwear putting on his pants and 
shirt while a policeman asked him to identify men who ran away when 
the raid started 
state television broadcast those scenes from the film which 
police made available to foreign reporters the same day they do not 
usually release material so quickly 
law and order minister adriaan vlok has promised foreign 
journalists he will release any information on the case as quickly 
as possible which also is unusual 
the film showed joubert directing the search while mrs mandela 
went about household chores provided refreshments to journalists 
waiting on the front lawn she was heard chatting laughing and 
listening to nat king cole music 
police searched through mrs mandelas belongings but did not 
take any of them said a journalist at the scene 
under apartheid the countrys 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

the wreck of a british man o war 
hauled from the delaware bay almost 200 years after it sank is 
providing archaeologists a rare glimpse of shipboard life in the 
1790s 
the find has shown that sailors were wellfed and enjoyed the use 
of wedgewood ceramic plates and goodquality muskets said charles 
fithian curator of archaelogy for the delaware bureau of museums 
and historic sites 
it also has revealed that the small twomasted fighting vessel 
had machinemanufactured fittings one of the earliest products of 
the industrial revolution he said 
its a whole chapter in maritime history said archaeologist 
garry stone past president of the society of historical archaeology 
and special assistant for historic site development for the new 
jersey department of environmental protection 
the hms debraak was lost in a sudden squall in 1798 in the mouth 
of delaware bay and was quickly covered with mud sealing the ships 
remains in an almost oxygenfree environment 90 feet below the 
surface fithian said a private salvage company raised the wreck in 
1986 
the 26000 artifacts recovered show that by the 1790s the 
material world of the sailor had improved fithian said 
a plethora of wedgewood yellow ceramic plates indicate sailors 
were issued mess kits and no longer relied on wooden bowls and 
despite contemporary accounts of bad food the cuts of meat were 
good and the seamen probably ate well he said 
salvagers also recovered the largest known collection of mens 
footwear and such leisure items as dominoes 
other items recovered include a sailors brimmed knit cap only 
the second one of its era known to exist a surgeons tourniquet 
screw used to stop bleeding a tooth extractor and a black wedgewood 
teapot used during mourning 
rumors of gold bullion aboard lured treasure hunters for two 
centuries but only a few gold and silver coins were found 
the debraak was a small fast ship developed for the hitandrun 
fighting style of the 18th century it was about 90 feet long and 
weighed about 255 tons fithian said 
the ship bears marks of the beginnings of assemblyline 
production the wooden discs or shivs in pulleys used to adjust 
its sails were machinemanufactured he said 
fithian said the ship was refitted from a dutch merchant vessel 
about two years before it sank and appears to have been giving 
rigging and sails that were as much as two times too large for the 
vessel that might have left it topheavy and led to its capsize he 
said 
he said his theory ties really nicely to a letter capt james 
drew wrote saying he was having trouble sailing the ship 
while the findings have expanded knowledge of the era experts 
say salvagers damaged or destroyed many artifacts in raising the 
vessel 
james delgado chief maritime historian for the national park 
service said the loss of artifacts helped persuade congress to pass 
a shipwreck preservation law giving states jurisdiction over salvage 
operations he praised the work of state archaeologists in 
preserving what was recovered 
what these folks are trying to do is conserve one third of a 
oneofakind book of which twothirds of the pages were torn out 
and muddied and many of them were burned no matter whatthere is 
no way the entire story of the debraak can be told said delgado 
new hampshire businessman l john davidson whose subsal inc 
raised the wreck defended the salvage effort 
sitting under the sand and continuing to rot is not the 
answer he said 
davidson said he plans to donate the artifacts and the hull to 
the state for a museum if he can avoid tax on the gift under an 
existing agreement delaware will receive only a sample of artifacts

cambodias provietnamese government 
and three guerrilla groups fighting it resumed peace talks today 
although the parties have said there is little hope for finding 
common ground 
the combatants gathered for the second day at the hotel 
indonesia where they were to be joined later by the foreign 
ministers of their allies 
vietnam and its ally laos are attending along with the 
association of southeast asian nations asean which backs the 
resistance 
indonesian foreign minister ali alatas who is organizing the 
talks told reporters today he remained optimistic but not overly so 
we all know there are still divergences of views he said 
hun sen premier of the provietnamese government in cambodia 
told the conference sunday that preliminary sessions that ended 
saturday showed the cambodian adversaries are still quite far 
apart and we do not hope yet to reach an agreement now 
during those sessions the cambodian factions restated old 
positions and clashed over key issues including who would 
administer postwar cambodia during a general election the 
provietnamese government or a new coalition government including 
the three guerrilla groups 
before the talks the four cambodian factions paid a courtesy 
call on indonesias president suharto today and alatas said suharto 
urged them to find a negotiated end to their 10yearold jungle war 
the war broke out when vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and 
ousted the communist khmer rouge regime 
during the khmer rouges fouryear rule about 2 million 
cambodians died from executions famine and civil unrest and the 
khmer rouge attacked the vietnamese border 
the indonesia discussions tentatively scheduled to end tuesday 
are the second round of multilateral talks 
the first in indonesia last july also was marked by clashes 
among the cambodians but produced a consensus that a vietnamese 
troop pullout must be linked to measures to prevent a khmer rouge 
takeover 
indonesia is host to the talks as an official interlocutor on the 
cambodian issue for asean which groups indonesia with thailand 
malaysia singapore the philippines and brunei 
hun sen and vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach said 
sunday that since an accord among the cambodians may prove elusive 
the negotiators instead should try to resolve what they called 
international aspects of the conflict including a vietnamese 
pullout an end to outside military aid to the guerrillas and 
preventing a khmer rouge return to power 
foreign minister wong kan seng of singapore told the conference 
it was dangerous to do that without an agreement among the cambodian 
combatants 
withdrawal without durable internal arrangements would only 
lead to intensified resistance against a regime that was installed 
as a result of external intervention he said 
also today thach told a news conference that delay in finding a 
settlement would only delay a vietnamese troop pullout 
he restated earlier pledges that hanoi would withdraw its 
remaining 50000 troops by september if a political agreement were 
reached among the cambodian factions if not he said withdrawal 
would be delayed until december 1990 
if others dont want an early solution then we must be 
prepared for the worst he said

an estimated 40000 gallons of gasoline spilled 
in an ohio river barge accident should dilute quickly in the 
rainswollen river without tainting water supplies or harming 
wildlife officials say 
no impact has been observed thus far said rich carter 
assistant chief of the ohio environmental protection agencys office 
of emergency response 
seven barges carrying gasoline from an ashland oil inc refinery 
in ashland ky to a terminal on the cincinnati waterfront broke 
free from a tow sunday morning and struck a railroad bridge piling 
within view of downtown cincinnati 
ashland spokesman roger schrum and the coast guard said two of 
the barges leaked gasoline 
the ohio crested saturday inches above flood stage and was 
falling today carter said the swift flow prevented any recovery of 
the gasoline but also should keep the spill from having much impact 
on water supplies or aquatic life 
the spill occurred downstream from intakes for cincinnatis water 
supply officials said gasoline tends to float on the waters 
surface and authorities said water systems that draw from the river 
could close their intakes until the spill floats past 
officials in louisville about 100 miles downstream were 
notified of the spill steve samuels production supervisor with the 
louisville water co said carbon had been added to water at one 
plant as a precaution to absorb any gasoline 
don fitzpatrick a spokesman for the indiana department of 
environmental management said the spill should reach the 
louisvillenew albany ind area by this evening if it doesnt 
evaporate first 
all other downstream communities close to the spill draw their 
water from wells or underground aquifers carter said 
the leaking barges were being drained of their remaining gasoline 
sunday night at an ashland facility in cincinnati and at a standard 
oil co facility in nearby bromley ky carter said 
river traffic was flowing normally by afternoon said coast guard 
lt chuck polk investigators were trying to determine what caused 
the barges to hit the norfolk amp southern railroad bridge he said 
the bridge was not damaged said herb nugent terminal 
trainmaster for norfolk amp southern 
sundays spill briefly created an overpowering stench of gasoline 
along the riverfront 
it was nauseating it would give you a headache said marian 
johnson of gods shelterhouse a cincinnati home for the needy near 
the riverfront

some college presidents are using state college 
trust funds to pay for perquisites despite repeated scandals 
involving abuse of the money the boston globe reported today 
among the reported examples 
former salem state college president james amsler used college 
funds to take his wife on a trip to new orleans several years ago 
and to pay for a class on creole cooking she took while there 
robert a corrigan former chancellor of the university of 
massachusetts in boston threw two christmas parties in 1987 for 
staff and university supporters at a total cost of 12000 
massasoit community college president gerard f burke has a 
740 saltwater aquarium in his office paid for from his 
discretionary trust fund he also uses the fund to pay the 61 
monthly fee to maintain it and replace dead fish 
the trust funds are set up to receive money except that which is 
appropriated to the colleges by the state they include student 
fees receipts from college bookstores parking lots and cafeterias 
and private and corporate donations the newspaper said 
college presidents have control over the funds and wide 
discretion in how they are spent as long as the use has some 
connection to college activities 
however in the past two years the presidents of five of the 
states 29 colleges and universities have had to resign because of 
violations involving state college trust funds the globe said 
former us sen paul tsongas the new chairman of the board of 
regents of higher education has made reform of the trust fund 
system one of his top priorities 
state inspector general joseph r barresi whose office is 
investigating trust fund abuses has proposed legislation to rein in 
what he called the disgraceful abuse of trust funds 
administrators have been permitted to treat these funds 
raised from fees practically as personal bank accounts barresi 
told the newspaper 
college presidents argue they need the trusts for programs and 
activities not funded by the state including experimental programs 
publicity and shortterm grants to students in advance of 
scholarship awards 
without the funds wed be handcuffed totally dependent on the 
amount the legislature gives us and that is too limiting said 
andrew scibelli president of springfield technical community 
college 
university of massachusetts officials say that internal 
accounting procedures are used to monitor accounts and that any 
abuses there would be detected

about 75 secondgraders in this 
affluent community are learning spanish the berlitz way in a program 
that shows how private contractors can play a role in public school 
education officials say 
here we had a fullblown developed program said tom benson 
superintendent of schools in the northern new jersey community of 
upper saddle river if you were to build a program yourself it 
would be exposed to criticism and flaws by the public and the 
board of education 
upper saddle river is the only district to contract with berlitz 
international inc but afterschool and weekend services by 
offcampus tutoring centers are growing rapidly officials say 
private tutoring chains such as the huntington learning centers 
of oradell kindercare incs sylvan learning subsidiary and 
american learning corp of chicago also have staked claims 
throughout new jersey and the nation 
the chains provide similar services classes of varying length 
involve 5 to 12 students ranging from preschool children to adults 
for monthly fees of 300 to 350 the centers enhance or overhaul 
the skills of students in rudimentary math reading and english 
officials say 
most centers also offer supplemental help like preparation for 
the scholastic aptitude test officials say 
the cost is not chicken feed but for many parents we are a 
last resort said ray huntington president and cofounder of the 
huntington learning centers its the industry of the 90s and 
beyond 
the number of huntington centers across the country has risen 
from 15 in 1985 to 90 there are 11 centers in new jersey each 
serving about 150 students a year huntington said 
american learning corp has 107 centers nationwide up from 38 
three years ago there are six centers in new jersey 
the largest of the fastgrowing tutoring centers is sylvan with 
more than 260 overall and 16 in new jersey 
alan handler executive director of the sylvan learning center in 
teaneck said new jersey is fertile ground for tutoring services 
because of its many affluent suburban communities and the pressure 
to succeed in higher education 
were here to supplement what the schools do handler said 
emphasizing the individual attention the centers offer a majority 
of students can do a good job with a standard curriculum ten 
percent do need extra instruction 
paula singer vice president of marketing for american learning 
said many parents turn to the centers to finetune their childrens 
skills 
parents want their kids to have a competitive edge ms 
singer said a lot of the new jersey schools are very good and we 
do well in areas where schools are good what youve got there is 
community where they value education 
the new centers have drawn little reaction from teachers or 
school officials 
public school teachers are aware of the private education growth 
but see it as an adjunct rather than replacement of their services 
said robert broderick a spokesman for the new jersey education 
association a teachers union 
however bringing a berlitz instructor into a public school 
classroom may disturb the spirit of community in schools created 
by ties between regular teachers and students broderick said 
meanwhile officials in upper saddle are hooked on berlitz and 
spent 30000 this year for the companys language lessons benson 
said 
what berlitz offers is the prestige and credibility of a 
program said morris corn principal of the reynolds school 
they are really creating educational reform

moderate afghan rebels returned today 
to try to settle deep differences with hardline moslem 
fundamentalist colleagues after walking out of a session called to 
name an interim government 
the bitter divisions have kept the pakistanibased guerrilla 
groups from picking a temporary president prime minister and 
cabinet that they hope will soon replace their homelands marxist 
government and usher in elections 
todays meetings at a religious compound on the outskirts of 
islamabad were held behind closed doors and there were conflicting 
reports of their progress journalists were kept outside 
sources associated with the consultative council or shura said 
participants still were divided along fundamentalist and moderate 
lines 
the moslem guerrillas have been fighting afghanistans 
sovietbacked regime for a decade the last soviet troops left the 
country wednesday under a unbrokered accord 
the guerrillas and some western diplomats believe the afghan 
government will soon fall without soviet troops 
the insurgents are fighting to establish an islamic republic 
however the fundamentalists want to establish a theocratic regime 
along iranian lines while the moderates are more nationalist 
the estimated 400 council delegates have failed during gatherings 
over the past 10 days to agree on steps toward forming their own 
postwar government or who would lead it 
iranbased shiite moslem guerrillas have boycotted the meeting in 
a dispute over their proportional representation with the majority 
sunni moslem fighters based in pakistan 
delegates on saturday nominated moderate leader mohammad nabi 
mohammadi as president and hardliner ahmad shah as prime minister 
however moderates said they walked out of sundays session for 
confirming nominees because many hardliners insisted ahmad shah be 
allowed to pick his own 35member cabinet 
the divisions have prompted fears of further bloodshed in 
warravaged afghanistan president najib who leads the government 
in kabul says his forces can successfully battle the guerrillas 
during the weekend najib declared a state of emergency put 
himself in charge of a new supreme military command and 
consolidated his power with a cabinet reshuffle 
communist forces hold all afghanistans key cities but the 
guerrillas say they control nearly 90 percent of the countryside

two executives of an air conditioner manufacturer 
were arrested today for selling the soviet union a chemical used in 
missile guidance systems police said 
tsugio uesaka and yoshimichi udagawa of daikin industries ltd 
were arrested for forging export documents and selling nearly pure 
halogenated hydrocarbon to the soviet union police officials in 
osaka said 
exports of the solution in concentrated form to communist 
countries are prohibited under japanese law and under an 
international agreement regulating the sale of hightechnology 
products to soviet bloc nations 
halogenated hydrocarbon a compound commonly used in fire 
extinguishers can also be used as a coolant for guided missiles 
analysts say 
daikin a major air conditioner maker based in osaka apologized 
for the illegal exports but denied any responsibility for the sale 
saying the two executives had acted independently 
it is regrettable that two employees of our company were 
arrested daikin general manager tadashi shibai told a news 
conference but i dont believe they were aware that they were

a series of explosions rocked a british army 
barracks in western england before dawn today after two intruders 
were spotted and soldiers were evacuated officials said the ira 
claimed responsibility for the attack 
col peter hicks a defense ministry spokesman said one soldier 
was slightly injured by flying glass when three blasts shook the 
ternhill barracks blowing out a wall of one block and igniting 
several fires 
thirty minutes earlier a sentry had fired warning shots at two 
intruders but they escaped said hicks 
police said they are searching for a car stolen by a masked man 
who broke into a nearby home about the time the bombs exploded 
they described the suspect as in his early 20s 5 feet 5 inches 
tall sallow of complexion and wearing a camouflage jacket 
the barracks near shrewsbury about 160 miles northwest of 
london houses the crack 2nd parachute regiment its 
colonelinchief is prince charles heir to the british throne 
the soldiers were scheduled to return to duty in northern ireland 
later this week said press association the domestic british news 
agency 
claiming responsibility in a statement issued to dublin media 
the irish republican army said while britain maintains its 
colonial grip on the north of ireland the ira will continue to 
strike at those who oversee and implement british government policy 
in our country 
hicks said a quickthinking sentry challenged two intruders one 
armed with a handgun inside the camps fence about a half hour 
before the blasts 
the sentry fired after them but bearing in mind that it was 
dark they quickly disappeared from sight and we do not think either 
was hit he said 
the guard ordered evacuation of the living quarters where 50 
soldiers were sleeping before the explosions began hicks said 
he said the guard found an abandoned shoulder bag in which the 
intruders were thought to have carried the explosives 
at dawn nearby residents reported acrid smoke hanging over the 
barracks flames had burned away the roof of one block 
security was ordered tightened at other british army bases as 
bomb disposal experts arrived at the barracks to search for clues 
a number of veterans of the 1982 falklands war against argentina 
live at the barracks but fewer men were asleep there than usual 
because many were on weekend leave no families live on the base 
a police helicopter was searching the area for the intruders who 
were believed to have hijacked a car on the main road outside the 
base and police roadblocks were checking motorists in the vicinity 
the parachutists have been an ira target since the bloody sunday 
shooting on jan 30 1972 in which 14 people were fatally shot by 
soldiers of the 1st parachute regiment during a civil rights march 
in londonderry northern irelands second largest city 
the last ira bombing in britain was on aug 1 1988 when one 
soldier was killed and nine injured in an early morning blast at 
inglis barracks in north london 
it was the first fatal attack by the ira in mainland britain 
since the bomb attack on the grand hotel in the south coast resort 
of brighton in october 1984 during a conference of the governing 
conservative party 
prime minister margaret thatcher escaped injury but five other 
people were killed in the assassination attempt 
the ira is fighting to oust britain from northern ireland and 
unite the predominantly protestant province with the overwhelmingly

former klan leader david duke who won 
election as a state representative even though president bush and 
former president reagan endorsed his rival denounces a threat to 
banish him from the gop as unamerican 
duke says blacks and jews have nothing to fear from him and hes 
urging the louisiana legislature and the republican party to accept 
that he has changed since his days as grand wizard of the knights of 
the ku klux klan in the 1970s 
i repudiate any racial or religious intolerance any group 
racial or religious has nothing to fear from david duke duke 
told a news conference sunday following his narrow victory over 
homebuilder john treen on saturday 
still duke did not mince words on where he stands on civil 
rights 
im for getting the government out of our personal lives im 
not for any law for segregation or integration he said the 
right not to associate is just as precious as the right to 
associate 
duke 38 edged the 63yearold treen for the house seat from the 
nearly allwhite district in metairie a new orleans suburb duke 
got 8459 votes or 507 percent and treen 8232 or 493 percent 
duke registered as a republican two days before qualifying for 
the race after his stunning success in beating six other candidates 
in the jan 21 primary the national party sent three advisers to 
help his opponent and persuaded bush and reagan to endorse treen 
us senators the governor and other community leaders of both 
parties warned that a duke victory would ruin the states reputation 
and harm already tenuous race relations jewish organizations 
decried his candidacy and the archbishop of new orleans warned 
voters to choose cautiously 
shortly after duke was declared the winner saturday night 
national republican chairman lee atwater denounced the outcome and 
vowed to have him censured and barred from using the gop name an 
unprecedented step 
david duke is not a republican atwater said in a statement 
hes a pretender a charlatan and a political opportunist who is 
looking for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his 
views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance 
duke responded is he going to censure me for my past how many 
republicans how many democrats have done controversial things in 
the past the actions of mr atwater are really unamerican 
dukes election also was condemned by civil rights leader jesse 
jackson he called it a symptom of a national problem of racism that 
the entire nation has to deal with 
several state lawmakers said they expect an attempt in the 
legislature to refuse to seat duke by challenging his residency but 
he dismissed allegations that he hadnt resided in the district for 
the required one year as frivolous 
it would be the first time the house has ever taken such action 
the legislature convenes for a special tax session wednesday 
the political process must remain inviolate duke said the 
men and women of good will in the legislature will not tolerate any 
challenge of this nature 
it all depends on what the majority of the house wants to do 
said house speaker jim dimos of monroe unless someone makes a 
motion to disqualify him then he will be sworn in i know the 
people in his district elected him by a small margin but he still 
was elected and has to be treated as a member 
some legislators said they believe a challenge of dukes 
credentials will go nowhere 
i expect there will be a movement said rep jim donelon a 
republican who represents an area near dukes i expect it will 
fail and i do not have enough information yet to say exactly what 
my position will be 
rep alphonse jackson a shreveport member of the black caucus 
said he would have nothing to do with a challenge 
if the people down there want him jackson said they 
deserve him

senate minority leader robert dole says the 
senate should stop the dragnet for information about defense 
secretarydesignate john tower and move ahead with his confirmation 
dole a kansas republican said he has seen nothing to disqualify 
tower for the post 
i think we should stop checking every rumor unless theres 
some criminal activity lets get on with the vote dole said on 
the cbstv program face the nation 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine another guest on 
the program promised a quick vote on the tower nomination once it 
leaves the senate armed services committee 
but mitchell who said he had not read the fbi reports on tower 
said allegations surrounding towers private life are an 
appropriate subject of inquiry because of the importance of the 
defense post 
there is i think a legitimate concern particularly since 
given the advent of modern technology a president a secretary of 
defense a national security adviser could have as little as 20 
minutes to react to the possibility of nuclear holocaust to bring 
judgment to bear at any time said mitchell 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services panel has 
said he plans to have a committee meeting on tower by wednesday and 
that a vote could come by the end of the week 
the house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee is 
planning a closed hearing wednesday to hear from two state 
department security officers who investigated alleged security 
breaches in geneva while tower was a us arms negotiator their in 
1985 and 1986 
investigators with that committee questioned one of the security 
officials berne m indahl for seven hours on sunday about his 1986 
inquiry 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii said sunday that 
president bush continues to stand by his nomination of tower 
asked on the nbctv program meet the press whether he 
considered tower an appropriate nominee baker said 
yes i do and i talked to the president yesterday and i can 
report to you that the president feels that way as well strongly 
much of the inquiry into towers fitness to become defense 
secretary has centered on allegations surrounding the former 
senators drinking habits and his relationships with women 
dole a longtime colleague of towers in the senate said he has 
read the fbi report on rumors involving towers personal life and 
ive found nothing that would disqualify john tower i think its 
time to stop the dragnet 
the pentagon is suffering because we dont have a secretary of 
defense said dole

the coast guard used two helicopters 
an air boat ice skiffs and private pleasure boats to rescue 175 
people stranded on a slab of ice in lake erie after it broke free 
from shore 
there wasnt a threat of danger as far as floating to canada 
but there was as far as the ice breaking up said james rusnak of 
the coast guards marblehead station near catawba island on sunday 
it was a real sunny day and it had rained the day before 
the milelong quartermilewide stretch of ice cracked and 
floated free saturday of the shoreline off catawba island state 
park where ice fishing is a popular sport 
no one fell off the ice slab which broke free about 55 miles 
west of cleveland and moved about a mile into the lake during the 
threehour rescue operation 
the ice floe took off pretty fast said dave matta an ice 
fishing guide from nearby port clinton who said he jumped over a 
6inch gap to a secure piece of ice when he noticed the slab 
cracking away from the shore 
there were people kissing the state park when they hit shore 
said matta 
some of the stranded people were rescued individually in large 
baskets suspended by cable from two coast guard helicopters but a 
sense of calm prevailed rusnak said 
some of them were stuffing fish into their pockets he said 
despite the popularity of the spot with sportsmen coast guard 
personnel advise against ice fishing on lake erie anytime he said 
the coast guards policy is the ice is never safe rusnak 
said there is always a crew on immediate standby 
nonetheless some 25 to 30 ice fishermen showed up sunday seaman

a soviet commentary printed in a 
czechoslovak newspaper today acknowledged for what was believed to 
be the first time that the 1968 kremlinled invasion caused deep 
disillusionment in czechoslovakia 
the appearance of the commentary in the communist party daily 
rude pravo follows premier ladislav adamecs visit last week to 
moscow 
the commentary said that not all czechoslovaks welcomed the 
soviet invasion in which soviet and warsaw pact troops crushed the 
prague spring reforms many of which were similar to economic 
and social changes now embraced by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
some people saw in this an important support in the struggle to 
preserve the foundations of socialism it said in others the 
action created a state of shock 
this was later replaced by deep disillusionment the feeling of 
national dignity being trampled upon leading among a part of these 
people to antisoviet moods said the commentary reprinted from 
the soviet daily sovietskaya rossiya 
the banned czechoslovak writer vaclav havel and eight other 
activists go on trial tuesday on charges in connection with 
demonstrations last month in prague their detention has prompted 
more than 2000 cultural figures and scientists to sign petitions 
calling for their release 
the soviet commentary did not refer to havel or the protests but 
it traced intellectual disillusionment to the invasion

governing national liberation party 
with only 12 percent of votes counted sunday night engineer 
roland araya accepted defeat and congratulated castillo

liberalism castillo 60 said in a victory speech 
the electoral tribunal said that with 12 percent of ballots

more than 25 percent last year and 6 percent unemployment 
castillo wants to maintain the countrys agricultural exports and 
fight corruption essentially continuing arias policies he 
previously has served as vice president deputy in congress and a 
cabinet minister 
arias who won the nobel peace prize for his plan to end central 
american wars has been criticized at home for paying more attention 
to international affairs than domestic problems many voters accuse 
him of inept planning that has depressed the economy 
castillo twice has lost his partys nomination to luis alberto 
monge who became president in 1982 and to arias in 1986 
this was arayas first presidential campaign his more liberal 
agenda called for diversification of exports and land reform to

a palestinian sought by the united states 
for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner was cleared today of 
illegal weapons charges in connection with a handmade knife found in 
his prison cell 
a misdemeanor court acquitted mohammed rashid 39 and returned 
him to korydallos prison where he has been jailed since his arrest 
in piraeus in may 
i had it the knife because i fear for my life i also fear 
they may extradite me to the united states rashid told reporters 
in the courtroom 
prison guards found the handmade stiletto and a file in rashids 
cell during a random search of his prison cell on friday 
i dont think the objects found in his cell could really be 
used to harm anyone prosecutor zacharias kokkinakis told the 
court 
the threemember panel of judges acted on the prosecutors 
suggestion and voted 21 in favor of acquitting rashid 
a bomb threat during the hearing forced authorities to evacuate 
the courthouse which was surrounded by dozens of police and 
security officers armed with submachine guns the court session 
resumed after a onehour break 
rashid is wanted by us authorities on charges of planting a 
bomb aboard a pan am jet over hawaii a teenager was killed and 15 
people were injured in the blast 
the greek supreme court twice has delayed a decision on whether 
to extradite rashid the case was further delayed last month when 
three supreme court judges resigned after a terrorist group 
responsible for killing a supreme court prosecutor threatened to act 
against court officials if rashid were extradited

gov edward d diprete called out the 
national guard to help staff the state general hospital overnight 
after union workers rejected an offer to settle a staffing dispute 
and set up picket lines 
james p benedict the hospital administrator said only 26 of a 
normal shift of 78 licensed practical nurses and attendants showed 
up for work at 7 am today they were augmented by 94 guard troops 
it was the second time in three weeks that the governor had 
assigned guard troops to help out at the hospital which provides 
longterm care to more than 400 patients because of labor trouble 
the state filed a request for a court order to halt the work 
stoppage but there was no immediate action on the request judge 
antonio s almeida met behind closed doors with both sides for more 
than an hour lawyers said later that he granted the unions request 
that it be given a day to prepare a defense 
while as of yet no critical patient need has not been met and 
no emergency that could not be addressed has occurred there is a 
critical need for local 1350 members to return to work before an 
individual patient has irreversible harm the states complaint 
said 
seven of the guard troops on duty today have nursing training 
the others are doing nonmedical tasks such as feeding washing and 
dressing patients 
they gave us the easier ones first to get us used to it said 
sgt robin trudel of warwick as she fed an elderly patient 
i think this is totally uncalled for connie prior 56 a 
quadraplegic who has been at the hospital for two years said of the 
job action number one should be the patients 
twelve patients needing intensive care most on respirators were 
moved to other hospitals 
a strike by state hospital workers would be illegal the union 
called todays job action merely a protest but benedict countered 
once you get those picket lines out there and theyre keeping 
people out i call it a strike 
state police said a halfdozen troopers were called in to keep 
hospital entrances open after picket lines were set up there had 
been no reports of violence and abut a dozen pickets were at the 
hospitals main entrance at 7 am 
members of american federation of state county and municipal 
employees local 1350 are locked in a battle with the state over 
staffing levels at the hospital the union has about 1300 members 
about of half of whom work at general hospital 
they voted by a 4to1 margin to reject a proposed 
53centanhour raise in return for concessions on staffing 
including greater management leeway in transferring staffers from 
ward to ward and reduction in overtime hours 
union president joseph g fargnoli called the raise offer 
insulting and the union claims several workers already have 
been injured because of an increased workload 
negotiations broke down friday and no new talks were scheduled 
workers staged a fourday sickout that ended jan 31 only when 
guard troops also were ordered by diprete to help staff the wards 
benedict called todays action an abandonment of patients and 
said it would result in disciplinary action but one picket who 
refused to give his name called benedicts comment an intimidation 
factor we expected that

the louvre museum closed monday for five weeks while 
workers put finishing touches on an 850 million expansion project 
to be inaugurated march 30 by president francois mitterrand 
when it reopens visitors will enter the museum through a tall 
glass pyramid soaring out of the courtyard and leading to a vast 
underground lobby 
there they will find ticket windows shops restaurants 
temporary exhibition spaces and an auditorium 
last year 35 million people visited the louvre often finding 
it difficult to navigate their way through the museums miles of 
poorly marked corridors and galleries even locating the entrance 
was a challenge as it was barely marked and sometimes hidden behind 
construction materials 
officials say all that will change with the installation of new 
electronic panels giving directions and other information on museum 
activities 
the grand louvre as the renovation project is known nearly 
doubles the musuems exhibition space 
ticket prices will increase slightly from about 330 to about

flood waters began to recede in parts of kentucky and tennessee 
but forecasts of more rain raised fears of additional flooding in 
areas that spent the weekend drying out 
it could be really bad for us cecil whaley operations 
officer for the tennessee emergency management agency said sunday 
night 
whaley said about 130 people were still unable to return to their 
homes sunday in western tennessee where nearly 400 residents were 
forced to evacuate when the obion river spilled over its banks 
flash flood watches were posted today for the area which is 
expected to receive an inch of rain tonight and tuesday 
in kentucky the ohio river appeared to crest sunday night at 
louisville but it began to rain again this morning and forecasts 
of an additional 1 to 3 inches accumulation by wednesday raised the 
prospect of additional flooding 
the salt and green rivers in central and western kentucky are 
high in some places and are backed up from the lower ohio river 
so another 2 inches in those basins could cause additional and 
extended flooding said mike murphy a technician at the weather 
service office in louisville 
backwaters from the ohio river forced the evacuation of about 100 
people early sunday at west point in hardin county where the salt 
river empties into the ohio about 20 miles southwest of louisville 
the town of 1570 had escaped flooding until then but 42 houses 
had to be evacuated mayor gene smith said 
elsewhere in kentucky much of the bullitt county town of lebanon 
junction remained flooded five miles to the southeast waters 
receded from us 62 ending the isolation of the little nelson 
county town of boston 
at lebanon junction 40 miles south of louisville half the town 
is blocked half the town is under water city councilwoman 
dolores lucas said sunday about 30 people remained in a shelter at 
lebanon junction elementary school said mrs lucas 
four straight days of heavy rain beginning feb 12 triggered 
widespread flooding over all but the eastern and southeastern 
sections of the state 
the highest recorded rainfall for the week was in the grayson 
county town of caneyville which got 1179 inches equal to a 
snowfall of 9 feet 
in western tennessee flood waters receded over the cold dry 
weekend but officials said substantial rain predicted for 
tonight and tuesday could once again leave buildings swamped and 
homeowners stranded 
whaley said the corps of engineers had reported sunday afternoon 
that the obion river was beginning to recede but that another inch 
or so of rain could send the water back into the emptied houses in 
obion county and could cause additional flooding 
meteorologist george quereau with the national weather service 
in memphis said the area can expect at least an inch of rain 
possibly more 
while their neigbors to the west worried about more 
precipitation snow was a welcome sight over the weekend for the ski 
resorts of eastern tennessee about 5 inches accumulated friday 
night on the cumberland plateau while as much as 9 inches fell on 
mountain city in johnson county and the higher elevations of 
sullivan county 
the town is booked pretty well solid since its a threeday 
holiday weekend said jim ahrends a salesman for the ober 
gatlinburg ski resort

are the spotted owls that live in the ancient 
forest of the northwest really endangered or are they being 
victimized by the miniature radio transmitters that scientists use 
to track their movements 
biologists now are debating that question as a result of 
expectedly high ortality rate among young owls outfitted with radio 
transmitters the scientists are also trying to determine whether 
the devices interfere with adult owls ability to reproduce 
since the early 1980s wildlife biologists have been strapping 
transmitters weighing about 20 grams or about as heavy as two 
quarters on the backs of both juvenile and adult owls 
if the transmitters are harming the owls then studies that 
concluded the owls may be a threatened or endangered species could 
be based on faulty data said hal salwasser deputy director of 
wildlife and fisheries at the us forest service 
we are very much concerned said salwasser many scientists 
believe we may have a problem 
larry irwin a corvallis ore wildlife biologist who has done 
spotted owl studies for the timber industry said questions about 
the effect of the transmitters on the birds amounted to a 
hypothesis that needs to be tested 
its an iffy thing said irwin there is no evidence to 
show the owls have been affected by the transmitters but it has 
been shown in other birds 
the fate of the spotted owl has become a major flash point 
between environmentalists the timber industry the forest service 
and the federal bureau of land management in the fight over 
protecting the ancient forests of the northwest 
the owls nest only in old growth timber and environmentalists 
have demanded that the ancient forests be protected to ensure the 
survival of the birds 
timber interests warn that such a ban on logging threatens the 
forestproducts industry in the northwest the two sides are waging 
a hotly contested court battle with the forest service and blm 
caught in the middle 
in 1987 the us fish and wildlife service refused to designate 
the owl as a threatened or endangered species a decision also being 
challenged in court 
despite years of study an aura of mystery still surrounds the 
spotted owl 
salwasser said that roughly 2500 breeding pairs of owls are 
believed to inhabit forests stretching from california to the 
british columbia border 
its not a population on the edge of extinction but they 
arent as numerous as robins said salwasser 
salwasser first raised forest service concerns about the effect 
of the transmitters on the owls in a recent briefing for 
congressional staff members from the northwest 
in an interview with the associated press salwasser said the 
agency plans additional studies of the owls this year using 
transmitters that weigh only a third as much as those used 
previously the new transmitters will be attached to the owls tail 
feathers rather than by the harnesslike contraption used before 
the new data might not turn things around but it may show 
things arent as bleak as some people thought said salwasser 
regardless of what the new studies show he added the spotted 
owl remains a rare species whose habitats are under pressure from 
logging 
not all scientists believe the transmitters are harmful 
the forest service is wrong thats my appraisal said 
charles meslow a fish and wildlife service biologist stationed at 
oregon state university 
meslow said the salwasser was citing the company line in 
raising questions about the transmitters effect 
the forest service desperately needs a better survival rate 
than what we documented said meslow 
while conceding that anytime you put anything on an animal it 
doesnt help them survive meslow likened strapping the old 
transmitters on an owl to placing a sixpound backpack on an 
averagesized person 
i believe that the vast majority of these transmitters are 
properly applied and i dont think they affect mortality 
rates said meslow 
meslow was involved in the forest services 198285 study during 
which transmitters were placed on 48 juvenile owls thirtyseven 
died in the first year 
meslow attributed the deaths to predations and starvation 
not the transmitters these were not unanticipated causes of 
death he said

chinas leading newspaper the peoples daily hit 
the stands monday with a new look designed to shore up its flagging 
circulation and better cover the news 
not bad for day one said a retired official as he read the 
paper in downtown beijing i guess you could say its glasnost 
with chinese characteristics 
the official organ of the communist party has seen its 
circulation fall 20 percent a year recently currently 4 million 
papers are printed a day the most of any daily in china but only 2 
percent of subscribers are private citizens 
in a front page letter to its readers the paper said the change 
would increase the amount and the timeliness of news 
we also will work to reflect the opinion of the people and help 
employ public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses 
closer to life it said 
in the past the paper has been filled with reports about 
bureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there tidbits of 
important information were often buried 
breaking news such as plane crashes and important government 
decisions was either not reported or published late and with scant 
details the paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues of 
little import to everyday life 
many chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift in 
the political wind but as the society has become more concerned 
with economic development than ideology the papers usefulness 
and its readership has diminished 
mondays editions differed from previous weeks but only slightly 
international news was displayed on page one several breaking 
stories were reported with current details an unusual report 
appeared on the status of chinas military draft more photographs 
lined the pages 
they wouldnt have had this a while ago said kang kexing 
pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawling 
for eels on the yangtze river before theyd only report it after 
it ended 
a companion story asked the agriculture ministry for reaction 
telephone interview by the paper read the headline 
they seem to be showing off here said kang very pleased 
with themselves for reporting this so soon 
other readers pointed to a story on salman rushdies apology to 
moslems angered by his book the satanic verses 
in the past it seemed that the only international news we got 
were things almost directly related to china said one reader 
this has nothing to do with china that seems to be a change and 
a good one 
the changes are limited however the peoples daily like all 
chinas papers and publications remains run by a government very 
concerned with what is read by its people 
newspaper officials interviewed monday said they believed the 
change would help the circulation which has dropped further since 
january when the paper doubled in price to about 5 cents 
readers on the street were less enthusiastic 
theres no comparison between this and some of the other 
papers said yang gong a 23yearold university student 
indeed the peoples daily is by far the stodgiest of the four 
dailies with the highest circulation in china 
the no 2 paper the workers daily although generally 
conservative occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power for 
the staterun labor union next in line the legal daily often is 
filled with lurid stories of murders and rapes 
the no 4 paper china youth news is one of the most interesting 
publications in china over the last seven months it has written on 
labor strife prostitution homosexuality and the uses of liquor for 
bribery 
the peoples daily was boring before and its boring now 
said chen daqin a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glass 
case holding mondays editions on bustling wangfujing street 
theyve changed the soup but the prescriptions the same

the state today failed to meet a federal 
judges deadline to reduce overcrowding at the intake center of the 
adult correctional institutions and risks fines of 50 per excess 
inmate per day 
there were 397 prisoners at the intake center this morning said 
joseph a dinitto assistant to corrections director john moran 
us district judge raymond pettine responding to a complaint 
from the american civil liberties union had set a limit of 250 
prisoners at the intake center where people are held while awaiting 
trial he has scheduled a march 13 hearing to levy any fines and 
warned state officials at a jan 31 hearing that he would be very 
hardnosed about this 
prison officials have expanded workrelease facilities and 
shuffled 409 prisoners since wednesday in an effort to remove 135 
alreadysentenced inmates from the intake center dinitto said 
he said state officials hoped pettine would see that as a 
goodfaith move to comply with his order 
we disagreesaid steven brown executive director of the 
rhode island aclu chapter we will be seeking implementation of 
the sanctions theyre doing too little too late the state was 
aware of this overcrowding problem years ago 
brown said the aclu had sought a court order as early as 1986 to 
prevent putting three inmates in a cell 
it really wasnt until six months ago that the department of 
corrrections began thinking about doing things brown said the 
state cant rely that it sat on its hands for so long 
among other programs legislation has been introduced to allow 
home confinement of nonviolent prisoners and for speedier bail 
hearings 
even with what theyre doing now the department of corrections 
rejected out of hand a number of proposals by the aclu several 
months ago to deal with overcrowding brown said 
those included weekend court so people arrested on minor crimes 
would not have to spend a weekend at the intake center and bail 
standards that would ensure speedier release

the 12 common market nations today said they will recall their 
ambassadors from iran to protest ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order 
that salman rushdie be killed for writing a novel many moslems say 
is blasphemous 
the decision in brussels by the european economic community came 
a day after the iranian leader spurned rushdies apology for 
offending moslems with his novel the satanic verses khomeini 
renewed his execution order 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said the eec 
nations also will require iranian diplomats in europe to stay within 
40 miles of where they are stationed 
he called the action by the eec foreign ministers a sign of 
solidarity with britain where rushdie an indianborn moslem lives 
and is now in hiding 
but it is also a signal to assure the preservation of 
civilization and human values the preservation of freedom of speech 
and expression genscher said 
late today britain announced it was closing its embassy in the 
iranian capital and withdrawing all the embassy employees britain 
restored diplomatic relations with iran last november following a 
17month break 
khomeini indicated sunday that he will not retract his order that 
rushdie be killed iranian clerics have put a 52 million bounty on 
rushdies head 
khomeinis decree also named rushdies publishers and copies of 
the novel have been removed from some bookstores shelves in the 
united states and japan fearing attacks some western publishers 
have decided not to print the book 
in washington on sunday secretary of state james a baker iii 
called the death threat intolerable and an obstacle to iran 
rejoining the community of civilized nations 
in new york roman catholic cardinal john j oconnor implied 
that catholics should shun the work because it offends moslems but 
criticized the death threat oconnor said he had not read the book

over khomeinis death decree by saying friday that rushdies life 
might be spared if he apologized and repented 
in an apology issued saturday rushdie said 
i recognize that moslems in many parts of the world are 
genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel i profoundly 
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere 
followers of islam 
irans official islamic republic news agency said at one point 
saturday that the apology from the 41yearold writer was probably 
sufficient to warrant a pardon but it later retracted the statement 
as only the opinion of one of its writers 
on sunday irna quoted khomeini as saying even if salman 
rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man of all time it is 
incumbent on every moslem to employ everything hes got his life 
and wealth to send him to hell 
khomeini said the imperialist foreign mass media are falsely 
alleging that officials of the islamic republic said that if the 
author of the satanic verses repents the execution order against 
him would be abolished this is denied 100 percent 
neither khomeinis statement nor irna in any of its reports 
sunday referred to khameneis suggestion of a reprieve reflecting a 
widening rift in the iranian hierarchy over the affair and their 
countrys relations with the west

and help in rebuilding an economy wracked by its eightyear war with 
iraq

minister otto jelinek it had blocked imports of the book after 
receiving a complaint from a moslem group 
the satanic verses is banned in iran india pakistan

decided not to publish the book and leading bookstore chains in the

president bushs visit to china is far more 
than just a sentimental journey to his onetime diplomatic post but 
also evidence of the steadily expanding ties between the two world 
powers 
the visit comes as the two nations celebrate the 10th anniversary 
of their formal diplomatic relationship on jan 1 1979 the united 
states switched its recognition from the nationalist chinese in 
exile on taiwan to the communists in beijing 
and while differences remain over matters as diverse as trade 
human rights and taiwan none are expected to loom so large as to 
mar the presidential tour chinawatchers inside and outside the 
government say 
bush said recently that the twoday visit which follows a stop 
in tokyo for the funeral of emperor hirohito stands on its own 
he cited the important strategic commercial and cultural 
relationship that we have with the chinese the largest number of 
people in the world are in that country 
the president also said that besides the strong bilateral 
relationship the two countries have forged he enjoys a personal 
relationship with its leaders dating from 1974 when he became 
the first us diplomatic envoy in beijing 
a state department official reviewing prospects for bushs stop 
in beijing said the trip comes as overall relations are considered 
good if not very good the official spoke on condition he not 
be identified by name 
one major sore point the chinese sale of missiles to the 
volatile middle east has been smoothed over for a time former 
secretary of defense frank carlucci was very satisfied following 
a visit last fall when he was assured the chinese will act in a 
responsible and prudent way the official said 
only defensive military hardware is sold to the chinese and the 
oficial said military exchanges are modest but growing and 
entirely satisfactory he said us officials hope highlevel 
chinese military officers will visit the united states in the near 
future 
the official said he wouldnt be surprised if the human rights 
situation in tibet were touched upon during the visit 
demonstrations there continue to be violently suppressed amid 
tibetan resentment of the chinese economic and political dominance 
and with uschinese trade booming the americans will try to 
press ahead on a bilateral investment treaty the treaty would 
provide protection for us investors in china similar to those 
enjoyed by chinese investors in the united states 
for their part the chinese also are expected to continue to seek 
additional access to western technology as a boost for their own 
domestic development 
at present china is the united states 13th largest trading 
partner with twoway trade totaling 134 billion the tables have 
turned in recent years and the chinese now enjoy a 32 billion 
trade surplus 
robert scalapino a director of the institute for east asian 
studies at the university of california at berkeley says he sees no 
reason to believe that uschinese relations will be 
fundamentally altered in the coming years of the bush 
administration although some ups and downs may well take place 
at the same time there is no reason to believe that the old 
issues between the united states and the prc will somehow be 
miraculously removed he said taiwan will continue to be a sore 
point with beijing 
scalapino in a brief prepared for the asia society said the 
united states continues to adhere to the agreements under which it 
observes the onechina policy that taiwan is a part of china and 
pledges to reduce us arms sales to taiwan over time but the 
united states also retains its informal relations with the taiwanese 
the united states is unlikely to make any major changes in its 
policies toward the prc or taiwan in the near future unless some 
unexpected event occurs scalapino said and the united states 
is not apt to accept an active role in bringing beijing and 
taiwan to the negotiating table to discuss reunification he added 
another important item for discussion will be the upcoming 
sinosoviet summit when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
visits chinese leader deng xioping in may the first such session 
in 30 years 
paul kreisberg a senior associate of the carnegie endowment 
says it cant possibly be a matter of indifference to the 
president that mr gorbachev will be meeting with the chinese 
leaders in the next couple of months 
from his point of view and from the chinese point of view 
its valuable for them both to have the relationship reaffirmed 
before the soviets and the chinese move on to the next stage in 
their relations he said

the furor in iran over salman rushdies 
the satanic verses probably stems more from the machiavellian 
machinations between political rivals in the tehran hierarchy than 
from religious outrage 
the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death sentence against the 
british author reflects an intensifying power struggle between 
socalled pragmatists who seek better relations with the west and 
fundamentalist hardliners 
behind the declaration diplomats and analysts see the hand of 
moslem radicals led by the increasingly powerful interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi and intelligence minister mohammad mohammadi 
reyshahri 
their aim is to undercut efforts by parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani and his allies to shed irans image of a nation of 
islamic fanatics who sponsor terrorism and end its selfimposed 
isolation by restoring relations with the rest of the world 
the rushdie affair has severely jolted irans relations with 
britain a country the hardliners consider second only to the united 
states as an enemy of their decadeold islamic revolution 
london which restored relations with iran only recently after a 
diplomatic dispute announced today it was closing its embassy in 
tehran the other 11 nations of the european economic community 
agreed to recall their ambassadors from tehran because of khomeinis 
order 
the timing of khomeinis angry outburst last week over the 
satanic verses first published in britain in september seems odd 
the novel has inflamed moslems around the world who think it 
blasphemes islam and has triggered moslem protests in saudi arabia 
india and pakistan yet it barely raised a ripple of outrage in 
iran which considers itself the beacon of fundamentalism among the 
worlds estimated 800 million moslems 
some analysts see khomeinis dramatic call for rushdies head as 
a bid to reassert himself as the preeminent leader in the islamic 
world following his humiliating acceptance in july of a 
unsponsored truce in the war with iraq 
the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch has admitted publicly 
that his agreement at rafsanjanis urging to end the grueling 
iraniraq conflict was more deadly than drinking poison 
khomeini had turned the war into an islamic crusade against iraqi 
president saddam hussein one prong in his drive to export his 
islamic revolution through subversion and covert action 
the ceasefire after a string of iranian defeats on the 
battlefield badly undermined the credibility of that campaign and 
marked a major setback for hardliners like mohtashemi 
the explanation for khomeinis death decree that diplomats and 
analysts consider most likely is that it is an attempt to discredit 
rafsanjani whose faction has been gaining the upper hand in the 
power struggle in tehran 
rafsanjani while criticizing rushdies book did not publicly 
endorse the death sentence his ally president ali khamenei sought 
to defuse the tension by saying that if rushdie publicly apologized 
the death sentence might be dropped 
rafsanjani named acting commanderinchief of irans armed 
forces by khomeini last june holds several key political positions 
and is considered the most powerful figure in tehran after the aging 
khomeini 
convinced that irans isolation cost it dearly in the war with 
iraq and that it cannot afford to be at odds with the rest of the 
world while it rebuilds he has stressed that tehran no longer seeks 
to export its revolution by militant means 
to the radicals that is anathema and violates the principles of 
the revolution 
the clamor over rushdies book has the hallmarks of earlier 
efforts by rafsanjanis rivals to thwart his policies 
in november 1986 hardliners leaked word of rafsanjanis 
clandestine dealings with the united states to trade hostages held 
by proiranian shiite moslem extremists in lebanon for badly needed 
military hardware 
rafsanjani wriggled out of that by admitting it in parliament 
plunging the reagan administration into a major crisis and claiming 
it as a political victory over the great satan 
arab sources with some knowledge of later dealings by iranian 
moderates to free western hostages in lebanon have said that 
hardliners like mohtashemi who has long had close links with the 
kidnappers has blocked efforts by the pragmatists to free the 
captives and gain friends in the west 
the radicals fear that the eventual outcome of rafsanjanis 
policy will be resuming relations with the united states severed in 
1979 for them that would be the ultimate betrayal 
the political infighting in tehran was largely masked during the 
war with iraq in the interest of unity but since the ceasefire it 
has become more open as the rival factions jockey for position for 
when khomeini dies 
although on paper the succession has been settled by the 
designation of ayatollah husseinali montazeri as khomeinis heir 
rafsanjani is clearly making a bid to become the real power in the 
postkhomeini era

ronald reagans white house physician said 
monday he now believes that executive power should have been 
transferred to thenvice president george bush after reagan was shot 
in 1981 
dr daniel ruge said that in hindsight the emergency provisions 
of the 25th amendment allowing for the transfer of authority should 
have been invoked after the march 1981 assassination attempt 
the doctor now living in retirement in denver said i knew all 
about the 25th amendment but it never occurred to me to 
suggest to reagans aides that it be invoked 
as white house physician he kept a copy of the 25th amendment in 
his bag ruge said in a telephone interview from his home 
but in the hours after reagan was shot in the chest by john w 
hinckley jr outside a washington hotel on march 30 1981 ruge said 
he was preoccupied with the presidents condition 
any physician should be more interested in his patient ruge 
said i have no apologies to make 
at the time of the shooting bush was traveling in texas he 
returned to washington immediately 
but testimony to a university of virginia study commission and 
statements by officials who were present at the time confirmed that 
a general state of confusion existed at the white house after 
reagans shooting 
there was no clear attempt to address the question of 
transferring power during the time that reagan was undergoing 
emergency surgery to remove a bullet from a lung or in the several 
days after when he was in a recovery room at the george washington 
university medical center 
somebody should have been looking after the store during that 
period ruge said but fortunately everything went well the 
country moved forward 
the former white house physicians remarks were initially 
reported in mondays new york times 
the white house atmosphere in the hours immediately following 
reagans shooting was dramatized by the nowfamous statement by 
thensecretary of state alexander m haig jr who proclaimed to 
reporters as of now i am in control here in the white house 
pending the return of the vice president 
section 3 of the 25th amendment ratified in 1967 four years 
after president john f kennedys assassination provides for a 
temporary transfer of executive power to the vice president 
the power remains with the vice president until the president 
sends a letter to leaders of congress certifying that he is ready to 
resume authority 
fred fielding who was reagans chief white house counsel at the 
time could not be reached for comment monday 
fielding however told the university of virginia study 
commission that to be very frank with you that day when i 
mentioned the 25th amendment i could see eyes glazing over in some 
parts of the cabinet they didnt even know about the 25th 
amendment 
reagan signed a letter to capitol hill leaders in 1985 at the 
time of his colon cancer surgery saying he was relinquishing power 
to bush during the time he was under general anesthesia 
but white house officials did not actually invoke section 3 of 
the 25th amendment on that occasion 
in a new york times interview shortly before his inauguration 
bush said that it never occurred to me to discuss the 25th 
amendment with his campaign running mate dan quayle now the vice 
president 
deputy white house press secretary steven hart said monday that a 
book contingency plan for transfer of presidential authority 
was compiled in the reagan white house and has been updated by 
the bush administration hart declined to comment on its contents 
but an administration official discussing the subject on grounds 
of anonymity said that it lays out steps to be taken in the event 
of an emergency transfer of authority including letters 
containing directions telling specified white house officials how to 
proceed in such an emergency scenario

about 32000 police are in town to try to ensure 
that fridays state funeral for emperor hirohito is safe and 
residents are feeling the pressure 
police say the massive force is justified by radical groups and 
the possibility that international terrorists might target one of 
the many visiting heads of state who will include president bush 
most tokyo residents appear to support the security effort which 
police say is part of the largest security operation every carried 
out in japan but some have complained about what they consider 
police excesses 
the major issue regards police pulling cars over at random for 
spot checks said a volunteer with a human rights hot line set 
up by several christian civic and legal groups to deal with 
complaints involving funeral security 
people are also unhappy with being stopped on the street to 
answer questions and with police searches of their homes said the 
volunteer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said the hot line has had more than 90 calls since feb 2 
police have searched an undisclosed number of homes and 
apartments on or near the route the funeral procession will follow 
through central tokyo 
residents are asked to voluntarily cooperate with the officers 
conducting the examination said one ranking official of the 
national police agency if they refuse we keep going back until 
they change their mind 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said most 
residents have cooperated and that rarely are search warrants 
necessary 
however it is a fear of rumors not a sense of civic duty that 
often leads to cooperation said an apartmentdweller whose 
residence has been searched 
when they come to your door what can you say if you tell them 
to go away all the neighbors will wonder what you have to hide 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
security forces also have kept a close watch on the hundreds of 
demonstrations held since hirohitos death jan 7 about 100 
protests are planned for friday police say 
during a recent protest march three ultraleftist groups 
scuffled several times with riot police although police reported no 
serious injuries on either side five radicals were taken into 
custody 
a suspect can be detained in japan for up to 22 days without 
being formally charged and police often arrest people on charges of 
unrelated crimes to extend the questioning period 
yoshihisa fujiwara one of the top leaders of the ultraleftist 
chukakuhas or middle core faction said 17 members of his group 
have been held since jan 7 
the police pay no attention to the law whatsoever he said 
while acknowledging his groups threat to disrupt the funeral 
chukakuha has said it can build rocketlike projectiles that can 
travel more than two miles 
more than 13700 people had participated in antimonarchy 
demonstrations by midfebruary and about 68 have been arrested 
police said 
opponents of the monarchy include christian groups leftists and 
some buddhists most argue that hirohito led japan into world war ii 
and failed to stop the oppressive actions of the militarist 
government of the time

despite objections from president bush the 
federal reserve board has forced interest rates higher in an 
inflationfighting battle that some economists fear may wind up 
pushing the country into a new recession 
the feds credit tightening efforts have been blamed for sending 
a variety of interest rates including mortgage rates and banks 
prime lending rate higher 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and other fed officials 
argue that the central bank has no choice but to move to dampen 
demand in an effort to keep the aging recovery from overheating 
however critics including the new president contend that the 
fed is overreacting to inflationary fears some analysts believe if 
the central bank does not soon relent it will topple the country 
into an economic downturn 
greenspan will get a chance to respond to the critics tuesday 
when he presents his semiannual report to congress on monetary 
policy 
the testimony before the senate banking committee will come 
just one week after the fed embarked on another round of 
credittightening following a government report that showed 
inflation at the wholesale level took an unexpectedly sharp jump in 
january rising at an annual rate of 127 percent 
the fed responded by pushing shortterm interest rates higher 
through a behindthescenes process that siphons off available bank 
reserves with the supply of money lower the cost of that money 
interest rates increases 
banks on feb 10 hiked their prime lending rate the benchmark 
rate for many business and consumer loans to 11 percent the 
highest the prime rate has been since the end of 1984 mortgage 
rates have been climbing as well with fixedrate mortgages now 
averaging above 105 percent 
the latest round of credit tightening comes at a sensitive time 
for the new bush administration higher interest rates boost the 
cost to the government of bailing out insolvent savings and loan 
associations a cost already put at 126 billion over the next 
decade 
the higher rates will also undermine the new presidents pledge 
to lower the budget deficit without raising taxes because higher 
rates raise the cost of government borrowing to finance the debt 
the fed launched its credit tightening last spring and has been 
pushing rates higher off and on since that time 
richard rahn chief economist for the us chamber of commerce 
said that the early credit tightening was appropriate but the 
central bank now has gone too far and is running a high risk of 
harming the economy 
federal reserve policy at the moment is misguided he said 
if they keep it up they could push us into a recession and that 
will make us worse off and end up increasing the federal budget 
deficit substantially 
however other economists say the fed really has no choice but to 
keep tightening in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures even 
at the risk of a downturn in the economy 
bruce steinberg an economist with the new york brokerage firm of 
merrill lynch said he expected the fed would keep pushing interest 
rates higher until summer 
steinberg said the economy would probably topple into a mild 
recession in the second half of this year caused in part by the fed 
tightening moves he based this prediction in part on a belief that 
many consumers will cut back on spending as they are forced to make 
higher payments on adjustable rate home mortgages 
bush said last week he did not believe inflation was a sufficient 
problem at present to warrant higher interest rates but the 
president tried to play down suggestions of a rift with greenspan 
maybe well get into a fight down the road but i dont think 
its at hand and i dont think greenspan and i are far apart 
bush told reporters 
steinberg said that greenspan would probably be doing the 
administration a favor by sending the country into a brief recession 
early in bushs first term 
if you postpone the day of reckoning it will still come and it 
will be a lot harsher he said if inflation rises significantly 
then interest rates would have to go much higher and the 
negative effects would be that much greater 
that is what occurred in the last downturn in 198182 when 
thenfederal reserve chairman paul volcker pushed the prime rate up 
to a high of 215 percent and sent the country into its worse 
recession since the great depression as the fed struggled to contain 
the countrys steepest inflation since the civil war 
in addition to revealing the feds money growth targets for 1989 
greenspan will also reveal the central banks economic outlook for 
the current year during his congressional testimony that outlook is 
expected to differ markedly from the bush forecast 
the administration hopes to reduce the budget deficit to 911 
billion for fiscal 1990 down from an expected 1633 billion 
deficit in the current fiscal year 
but those hopes are based on the assumption that the economy will 
grow at a rapid 32 percent annual rate through 1990 
while that would be down from the 38 percent increase in the 
gross national product for 1988 the best in four years it would be 
still be well above growth levels that greenspan and other fed 
officials have indicated are sustainable 
the fed has argued that much slower growth is needed so that 
increases in demand can be accommodated by an economy already facing 
tight labor markets and high factory operating rates

and told them to get out 
police set up roadblocks in the area of the ternhill barracks

the outlawed irish republican army in a statement issued to 
dublin news media claimed responsibility for the bombing and said 
other attacks would follow unless the british left the province 
while britain maintains its colonial grip on the north of 
ireland the ira will continue to strike at those who oversee and 
implement british government policy in our country said the ira 
which has made british soldiers a prime target in its fight to drive 
the british out of the predominantly protestant province and unite 
it with the mainly roman catholic republic of ireland

perimeter fence shortly after 3 am one of the intruders produced a 
handgun and they fled he said

been an horrendous incident

republicans are shelling out an eyecatching 2 
million or more for campaign salaries in an uphill drive to gain a 
majority in the house a move setting off tremors among lawmakers 
who refused to raise their own 89500 pay 
a few republicans have expressed their concern to house gop 
leader bob michel about the 250000ayear salary for political 
consultant edward rollins according to a spokeswoman 
but rollins defenders fire back scornfully reflecting 
longsimmering tensions between senior more moderate house 
republicans and younger conservatives who favor confrontation 
tactics to end their 34yearold minority status 
we have been in the minority since 1954 we have acquired the 
habits and strategies of a comfortable minority said rep newt 
gingrich of georgia 
complaints about rollins pay are a classic example of the 
defeatist attitude that says lets only pay enough to get a guy 
who will keep us in the minority said gingrich 
rollins who ran president reagans victorous 1984 campaign and 
was at the helm of jack kemps unsuccessful run for the white house 
in 1988 is taking over as vice chairman at the national republican 
congressional committee next month he is bringing with him a small 
group of aides some with close ties to hud secretary kemp at 
hefty fivefigure salaries 
i feel im worth it and i hope to prove it to them said 
rollins who is severing his relationship with a washington lobbying 
firm but will keep two or three outside clients as part of his 
fouryear contract with the nrcc which raises millions of dollars 
annually 
rollins concedes his chances of producing a house gop majority in 
four years quite slim but says he hopes to pave the way for 
republicans to take control later in the decade 
committee spokesman john buckley concedes it was poor public 
relations to have word of rollins 1 million fouryear contract 
become known virtually the same day lawmakers were loudly voting 
down a raise in their own pay 
rollins was hired after an extensive search in which rep guy 
vander jagt of michigan the committee chairman and others kicked 
around names including former white house chief of staff ken 
duberstein and outgoing major league baseball commissioner peter 
ueberroth michels spokeswoman johanna schneider said her boss 
simply wants to make sure that the moneys well spent 
but one senior gop aide said michel has personal misgivings over 
the arrangement and believes it was definitely a coskemp cadre 
inspired thing a group of junior republicans operating as the 
conservative opportunity society has worked in recent years to 
redefine the party in hopes ot gaining a majority but not without 
friction with michel and others 
this aide speaking anonymously said some lawmakers question 
whether the money is going to get you a majority and also say 
that rollins and the team he is assembling has sparse experience in 
congressional campaigns as opposed to presidential politics 
rollins says my goal for 1992 is not a majority my goal is 
to be competitive in 218 districts a majority of 435 and gain a 
majority in the 90s republicans held 192 seats in the house 
following former president reagans election in 1980 but now hold 
174 
rollins said he intends to define a very clear message thats 
different from the one republicans have had 
we need to run better candidates and run more effective 
campaigns he added 
he said democratic congressional candidates have fared well 
despite the election successes of presidents reagan and bush by 
making it appear to voters that they were all part of the same team 
of government 
what we have to do is very carefully peel them away from the 
president he said 
like the democrats republicans also are planning an effort to 
influence the congressional district reapportionment due to take 
place after the 1990 census in hopes of picking up new seats 
expected to be created in states such as florida texas and 
california 
rollins team includes ann stanley political director for former 
rep kemps president campaign and spokesman buckley another kemp 
campaign veteran both will receive salaries of 70000 to 85000 a 
year and envision fouryear commitments buckley said 
marc nuttle a senior aide in the rev pat robertsons 
presidential campaign is chief of staff for the transition 
according to buckley and may very well stay 
joseph gaylord the previous executive director has a 70000 
consultants contract for one year 
rollins also is expected to hire several other aides with closer 
ties to bush

blacks are planning a consumer 
boycott and civil disobedience campaign to protest ultraracist 
policies in the mining town of carletonville black union members 
said monday 
the protest campaign has been provoked by two related 
developments the reintroduction of hardline apartheid measures by 
rightwing town councilors and the alleged beatings by white 
vigilantes of blacks seen in the town after dark 
local affiliates of the congress of south african trade unions 
the countrys main black labor federation said the protests were 
planned at a community meeting saturday in khutsong a black 
township outside carletonville 
carletonville 45 miles southwest of johannesburg was one of 
several dozen towns where the extremeright conservative party took 
power in local elections in october 
the town council subsequently voted to resegregate local 
facilities that had been opened to all races and to build a fence 
around the town hall to keep blacks off the lawn 
last month the council said it was studying the possibility of a 
curfew barring blacks from carletonville at night but no action has 
been taken yet 
the trade union statement said the boycott expected to begin 
next week was decided on to protest the ultraracist policies of 
the town council 
we resolve to defy aparthied laws imposed on us to defend 
ourselves against assaults by white conservatives in the town and on 
the mines to withdraw our buying power from whiteowned businesses 
big and small said a resolution adopted at the community meeting 
tentative plans were made at the meeting for a sitin at the main 
park in carletonville where whitesonly signs recently were 
erected 
the union statement said black community leaders directed special 
criticism at the anglo american corp the countrys largest mining 
conglomerate for allegedly continuing to deal with apartheid town 
councils 
a black consumer boycott has been under way since before 
christmas in the industrial town of boksburg where the 
conservativecontrolled council has resegregated parks and other 
facilities the national party government of president pw botha 
has made no move to halt the boycott even though stateofemergency 
regulations prohibit the organization of such protests 
the government which has condemned the conservative partys 
resegregation campaign has been accused of hypocrisy because it has 
made no move to repeal the law that allows blacks to be barred from 
local facilities

hundreds of indians painted for war and 
representing tribes of the amazon began a historic effort monday to 
stop the government from building two hydroelectric dams that would 
flood native lands 
it is the first time diverse tribes from the vast amazon rain 
forest have joined in a political movement 
we will bring indian peoples together to fight said chief 
sebirop of the gaviao tribe we will not accept the dams where 
will we live what will we eat 
he and the others oppose construction of the kararao and 
babaquara dams on the xingu river a major amazon tributary which 
would flood an estimated 3000 square miles of rain forest and 
displace 7000 indians 
thousands of prodam demonstrators in trucks cars and on 
horseback paraded through the streets of this remote jungle town 
carrying signs reading the dams mean more jobs and more progress 
and gringos leave us in peace airplanes with banners carrying 
similar slogans buzzed overhead 
brazil has about 220000 indians in a total population of 144 
million historians say the number has declined from about 5 million 
when portuguese explorers landed in 1500 
tribes along the xingu face opposition from government and 
industry which say the power the dams would generate is vital to 
economic growth 
about 500 indian men women and children from more than 20 tribes 
attended the opening session of the conference monday at a brick 
community center in this city of 38000 people 2000 miles northwest 
of rio de janeiro 
included were 100 warriors from the kayapo tribe the main 
organizer of the gathering they ran into the center chanting 
wearing greenandyellow feathered headdresses and daubed with red 
and black war paint 
they circled in a ritual dance then put palm ronds on the 
concrete floor and sat kayapo women carrying machetes many with 
young children sat around the group 
whites predominated in the crowd packing the concrete bleachers 
and the auditoriums balcony they cheered and applauded as each 
tribal delegation arrived 
brazilian and foreign environmentalists were among the onlookers 
foreign organizations represented included the environmental defense 
fund based in washington and friends of the earth which has its 
headquarters in london 
chiefs stepped onto a wooden platform in turn and spoke about the 
dams 
we want the goverment to rethink the dams said jorge terena of 
the terena tribe the land is sacred to us it has the roots of 
our culture and our ancestors the electricity wont benefit 
indians only whites and their industries 
david yanomami of the primitive yanomami tribe that recently won 
a un global 500 award for defense of the environmental 
defense took the platform and declared we will not accept the 
dams the river will rise the fish will die the game will move 
away 
all the chiefs spoke in portuguese brazils national language 
sometimes with accents and imperfect grammar 
some kayapos made a videotape of the meeting to replay for their 
villages 
the indians invited president jose sarney and ranking cabinet 
ministers to the meeting but the government sent fernando mesquita 
president of the brazilian environment institute 
boos and whistles came from the crowd when mesquita said we 
recognize that great indignities were committed against the indian 
people but now it is a question of national awareness we are here 
to listen 
sarney who was out of the country monday has said he favors 
protecting of indians and the amazon environment but does not want 
foreigners telling him how 
the government has temporarily shelved plans for the babaquara 
dam but is actively studying the kararao project which is intended 
to produce 11 million kilowatts 
officials say work on kararao could start in the early 1990s 
brazil has approached the world bank about partial financing

a 22yearold lebanese on trial for 
the shooting death of a french passenger on a hijacked air afrique 
jet told switzerlands highest court monday that the killing was an 
accident 
i did not want to kill anyone i only wanted to liberate my 
friends hussein hariri said referring to his demands for the 
release of lebanese and palestinian prisoners held in israel 
hariri went on trial monday on charges of murder attempted 
murder hostagetaking and four lesser counts stemming from the july 
24 1987 hijacking the dc10 which carried 164 passengers was 
diverted to geneva while en route from the congolese capital of 
brazzaville to paris 
the defendant said passenger xavier beaulieu 28 was shot when 
he got out of his seat and made a threatening move 
chief judge jeanjacques leu noted that according to a forensic 
expert beaulieu was shot in the head from behind from less than a 
foot away beaulieus head had been covered with a blanket leu said 
pretending that you killed him accidentally is an absurd 
attitude prosecutor willy heim told hariri it will turn 
against you 
hariri declined to confirm that he had been on a hezbollah 
mission at the time of the hijacking he said he would not talk 
about his private life and political activities 
what i did was by conviction he said 
hezbollah is lebanons most militant moslem faction it is 
considered an umbrella for the groups holding most of the 15 foreign 
hostages in lebanon a swiss red cross delegate was held captive for 
a month in lebanon late last year in an apparent attempt to win a 
lenient sentence for hariri the swiss said no concessions were made 
police carrying submachine guns guarded the federal criminal 
court which only hears cases of particular gravity and last 
convened six years ago the court building was ringed by barbed wire 
and nearby streets were closed to traffic 
the bearded defendant wearing an olivecolored jacket insisted 
on a court interpreter but frequently switched from arabic to french 
hariri suggested the court had no standing to try him 
i did not take any action against the swiss he said this 
was not a swiss plane there was no swiss among the passengers i 
did not have any demands from the swiss except refueling that is 
why i protest this judgment 
during the hijacking authorities said hariri threatened to blow 
up the plane with tnt however he told the court the threat was 
just words i did not intend to explode it 
asked by the chief judge to confirm that he paid the equivalent 
of 6 to bypass security checks at bangui the capital of central 
africa where he boarded the plane hariri said i do not know 
after seizing control of the plane over italy the hijacker 
demanded to be flown to beirut but agreed to stop in geneva for 
fuel after the plane landed at cointrin airport the hijacker shot 
and killed beaulieu and threatened to kill another frenchman 
crew members subdued hariri after a congolese steward was shot 
and seriously injured police stormed the plane when passengers 
opened the emergency doors

the government and the opposition reported 
little progress monday in talks on polands ailing economy and one 
official said the differences could delay an overall agreement 
politburo member wladyslaw baka the partys senior official on 
the economy criticized the opposition for not being prepared to 
discuss a fivepoint outline on the economy it had received friday 
a government spokesman said 
the comments came as the talks that began feb 6 between 
authorities and the banned solidarity union entered their third 
week the negotiations are aimed at reaching a new social contract 
which would reinstate solidarity and achieve national consensus on 
economic and political reforms 
baka expressed concern that excessive delays in the working 
group on the economy could hinder the progress of the talks as a 
whole the official pap news agency said 
the working group continued simply to exchange views rather than 
reach compromises said solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz at 
a news conference on the third session of the talks 
it is a fact that progress seems to be slowest at the economic 
table but the situation there is definitely the most difficult 
one he said 
in the case of political reforms and trade union freedoms the 
topics of the two other main working groups the issues are easily 
defined and the sides either agree or disagree he said 
but solving economic problems requires often finding a lesser 
evil or such as solution that will advance the problem but wont 
cause too great social tensions 
the governments fivepoint outline discussed improving market 
supplies curbing inflation providing a social safety net for 
people likely to suffer from upheavals in the economy restructuring 
stateowned industries and servicing polands 38 billion foreign 
debt the east blocs largest 
the official side presented the outline as a basis for 
discussion but government spokesman zbyszek rykowski said the 
solidarity team was unprepared for a serious discussion because 
it wanted to discuss the outline among itself 
i am afraid that this very formalized approach may delay the 
work of our team and subsequently that of the round table as a 
whole baka told pap 
the leader of the solidarity delegation witold trzeciakowski 
gave his personal view that the outline lacked details and that the 
government has not addressed the oppositions request for creating a 
social council that would supervise the implementation of economic 
reforms according to pap 
we think that the new sejm parliament to be elected which 
will have participation of the opposition will be the proper 
constitutional forum for such a control said rykowski at a news 
conference 
so far the talks have yielded agreements in principle on how 
solidarity can be legalized and that the new parliament would have a 
minority opposition representation 
onyszkiewicz said that in addition to the economic talks several 
stumbling blocks to overall agreement remain particularly in 
political reforms 
he mentioned a government proposal saturday to introduce into 
poland a strong presidency which solidarity considers unnecessary 
and officials refusal in talks to guarantee the opposition access 
to state radio and tv

president mikhail s gorbachev said monday the 
confusing electoral system he ushered into law in december already 
is in need of reform 
gorbachev made his comments in a visit to kiev the capital of 
the ukrainian republic activists there said several thousand people 
had rallied and demanded that the republics communist party leader 
a holdover from the era of leonid i brezhnev be thrown out 
preparing for the elections we are going through a very 
important school of socialist democracy gorbachev on the first 
day of his visit to kiev 
of course we havent taken everthing into account yet we will 
review the results of the campaign carry out the necessary 
corrrections in order that our electoral law fully expresses the 
will of every person and of society as a whole gorbachev said 
his remarks distributed by the official tass news agency did 
not say what parts of the electoral law gorbachev has concluded are 
in need of reform 
the law created a new 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
that will be elected for the first time in voting on march 26 
onethird of its members will be chosen not on the basis of 
geographical districts but by the communist party its affiliates 
unions social and political organizations 
some popular candidates like former moscow party chief boris n 
yeltsin and human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov have been 
nominated in many different electoral districts complicating the 
process sakharov has complained that the new system is not 
democratic enough 
the nominations made since the electorial campaign opened in 
december have been set before local commissions that will decide 
which names will be placed before voters 
the evening tv news program vremya devoted its first 25 
minutes to a report on gorbachevs arrival monday in kiev the 
capital of the secondlargest soviet republic that is run by 
vladimir v shcherbitsky 71 a holdover from the brezhnev era 
there have been many reports since gorbachev took power in march 
1985 that shcherbitsky was in trouble with the reformminded 
gorbachev but he has remained in power the ukraine has been 
criticized at times for poor agricultural and industrial output 
shcherbitsky is the only remaining member of the ruling party 
politburo appointed under brezhnev whose 18 years in power now are 
criticized as a period of economic and social stagnation as well as 
rampant corruption 
yuri mityunov a moscow activist involved in several informal 
political movements reported that several thousand people had 
gathered in kievs october revolution square demanding that neither 
shcherbitsky nor kiev party boss konstantin masek be elected to the 
congress 
mityunov said the demonstrations were organized by the peoples 
movement an organization similar to the peoples front movements 
that have sprung up in many parts of the soviet union to push for 
reforms and greater local autonomy he said police did not interfere 
with the protests 
shcherbitsky welcomed gorbachev at the kiev airport and 
accompanied him on his initial visits in the city there was no word 
in the official media how long gorbachev would stay 
characteristic for his frequent trips out of moscow gorbachev 
spent time chatting with local residents on a kiev street and 
highlighted a soviet technological achievement 
the vremya report focused on gorbachevs questionandanswer 
session with a group of elderly and youth on a kiev street 
tass said his comment on the electoral system were made in that 
exchange but it was not show on television 
gorbachev also was shown the new sixengine an225 transport 
plane the jet capable of lifting 250 tons of cargo was flown past 
gorbachev at the kiev airport and the manufacturers said it was 
developed solely with sovietmade equipment 
that squares with gorbachevs call for the soviet union to rely 
on its own technical expertise wherever possible and to encourage 
soviet industry by putting forward examples of highquality 
sovietmade products

prime minister mohammed hassan sharq 
resigned monday broadening the power of president najib 
in pakistan meanwhile afghan scholars and moslem guerrillas who 
have vowed to topple najibs government took on the task of 
nominating an interim afghan government when their top leaders could 
not agree on the issue 
sharq 63 had remained in najibs 28man cabinet after a weekend 
shakeup in which the president replaced seven of 10 noncommunist 
party ministers with members of his peoples democratic party 
sharq was not a member of the party but had been selected as 
prime minister by najib last may to portray his government as 
enjoying broader support 
a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said sharq met with 
najib and agreed the president should head the cabinet during the 
state of emergency that najib declared saturday

party politburo and central committee and military leaders 
foreign minister abdul wakil said sunday the council will 
coordinate economic and military activities he said it will not 
replace the cabinet but did not elaborate

forces alone in their fight against the ussupported guerrillas

to a breakthrough in stagnated relations with egypt and a 
normalization of israelisoviet ties 
maybe were entering a more intensive stage in the middle east 
peace process shamir said on israel tvs arabiclanguage program 
im not convinced in that but i would like to hope that the 
meeting with president mubarak would renew something in 
relations between us and egypt and would express some special 
egyptian activity regarding the peace process 
maybe this meeting foretells some breakthrough he added 
of arens scheduled meeting with shevardnadze shamir said i 
think that with every meeting we are coming closer to a 
normalization of the relations moscow broke after the 1967 
arabisraeli war 
renewal of ties is an israeli condition for a soviet role in the

per day for excess inmates

hardnosed about this when he considers levying fines at a march 
13 hearing 
dinitto said the state has made a goodfaith effort to comply 
with the judges order removing 135 inmates from the intake center 
since wednesday 
we will be seeking implementation of the sanctions said 
steven brown executive director of the rhode island aclu chapter 
theyre doing too little too late

prevent putting three inmates in a cell there are 168 cells at the 
intake center according to dinitto the prison complex overall has 
2075 prisoners 
brown said the corrections department rejected out of hand

aflcio leaders opened their annual 
meeting monday with an eye on domestic policy backing a broad 
congressional agenda that includes calls for a higher minimum wage 
day care and parental leave 
the 35member executive council of the labor federation also met 
with senate majority leader george mitchell on tuesday union 
leaders plan to sit down with labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the council issued four policy statements on its domestic 
priorities including one on the needs of working families that 
called for passage of bills guaranteeing parental leave and 
expanding day care opportunities 
the working standards and social services provided by these 
legislative initiatives will enable workers to be both productive 
employees and responsible family members the statement said as 
we promote the economic security and stability of families we 
advance the economic and social health of the nation 
the federation also promised full support of 9000 machinists who 
are set to strike against eastern airlines on march 4 the 
machinists are threatening to picket other carriers that have 
service agreements with eastern or its parent corporation texas air 
the council also established a committee to study the needs of 
working families and suggest changes in laws and contract language 
in calling for an increase in the minimum wage which has been 
frozen at 335 for eight years the 19million member labor 
organization said it would take 456 to purchase what 335 bought 
when that level was set in 1981 
legislation sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass would 
increase the minimum wage to 455 through three annual increases of 
40 cents 
mitchell after his meeting with the labor leaders said he would 
bring to the senate floor for debate a minimum wage bill that does 
not contain a subminimum youth training wage that president bush 
has said would have to be included for him to support it 
aflcio president lane kirkland and mitchell said it was too 
early to rate bushs relationship with labor but both said the new 
president was off to a better start than president reagan whose 
relationship with labor was acrimonious from the outset 
the atmosphere has changed considerably and i certainly welcome 
that kirkland said we still have to see what the concrete 
product is

economic issues and bonns 
reluctance to replace shortrange nuclear missiles dominated summit 
talks monday between british prime minister margaret thatcher and 
chancellor helmut kohl 
friedhelm ost kohls chief spokesman said economic issues 
topped the agenda he played down differences over modernizing 
shortrange nuclear weapons 
we are closer on many points than most people suspect ost 
told reporters 
he said both leaders agreed that nato allies must demonstrate 
unity at a summit meeting scheduled for this spring 
ost said kohl reiterated his desire for wideranging efforts in 
arms control and disarmament 
kohl said last week he wanted to see the north atlantic treaty 
organization include a disarmament mandate in its general strategy 
statement to be issued after its summit that clause would require 
nato to open talks aimed at removing shortrange missiles if the 
soviets cut down their conventional arms advantage 
the two leaders also discussed problems coupled with implementing 
the planned barrierfree west european market in 1992 and a 
proposed single european currency he said britain strongly opposes 
the currency proposal 
there is a determination on the part of both countries to work 
close together on the missiles issue said bernard ingham mrs 
thatchers spokesman after the hourlong meeting 
he also reiterated mrs thatchers determination the weapons be 
replaced 
the prime minister believes that you wont get anywhere without 
demonstrating a strong defense ingham said 
kohl has said he wants to put off until 1991 or 1992 a decision 
on whether to replace the approximately 600 lance missiles stationed 
in west germany rather than make the issue part of next years 
national election campaign 
the british government however has been pushing to replace the 
aging missiles and boost west european defenses 
west germans have become increasingly interested in better ties 
with the soviet bloc and fear introducing new missiles could thwart 
progress already made 
kohl discussed the issue last week with visiting secretary of 
state james a baker iii and the two sides did their best to 
minimize potential conflicts 
us officials hope to replace the lance missiles aimed at east 
germany and czechoslovakia with rockets capable of traveling up to 
300 miles the current missiles have a range of nearly 75 miles 
ost said kohl and thatcher also discussed preparations for the 
nato summit expected in may or june and the investigation into the 
december bombing of pan am flight 103 
west german officials have displayed increasing annoyance over 
british investigators suggestions that the bomb that destroyed the 
boeing 747 was placed on board in frankfurt 
earlier monday police helicopters circled overhead and many 
downtown streets were blocked off as mrs thatcher toured frankfurt 
landmarks 
with attacks by the irish republican army always a danger 
special precautions were taken for her visit including deployment 
of more than 2000 police 
thousands of people lined the streets to cheer mrs thatcher as 
she visited st pauls church frankfurt cathedral and other sites 
there also was dissent early in the evening 150 people marched 
peacefully through parts of downtown frankfurt in a protest against 
mrs thatchers economic policies organized by the german communist 
party 
the summit will close after a second round of talks tuesday

the chief government spokesman monday defended prime 
minister noboru takeshitas statement that it is difficult to judge 
whether japan was an aggressor in world war ii 
takeshita said last week during questioning in parliament that 
some people believe the war began by accident or was fought in 
selfdefense he said the question of whether japan was an aggressor 
would have to be decided by historians some time in the future 
government spokesman keizo obuchi said monday that takeshitas 
comments were in line with the governments longstanding view it 
is regrettable if what the prime minister really meant was 
misunderstood by people in other countries kyodo news service 
reported 
obuchi noted takeshita also said that japan caused neighboring 
countries a great deal of misery in the past and therefore it is 
determined to contribute to world peace to avoid a repeat of such 
suffering 
asked last week about takeshitas comments chinese foreign 
ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said world war ii was a war of 
aggression that brought tremendous suffering to the chinese people 
and the people in asia as a whole 
he said the suffering and japans war responsibility are a 
historical fact which cannot be changed by anyone 
in south korea the yonhap news agency said takeshitas remarks 
about the war were ambiguous and glossed over japans responsibility 
for war atrocities 
japans war role has remained a controversial issue here last 
may national land agency chief seisuke okuno a cabinet minister 
resigned after asian countries strongly criticized him for 
repeatedly stating that japan was not an aggressor in the war 
members of the governing liberal democratic party say many among 
them continue to share okunos belief

european common market governments decided monday to withdraw 
their top diplomats from iran to protest ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis renewed order for moslems to kill novelist salman 
rushdie britain went further by pulling out its entire embassy 
staff 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said the death threats 
against rushdie and the publishers of the satanic verses for 
allegedly blaspheming islam were unwarranted interference in 
britains internal affairs 
he left open the possibility of expelling irans lone diplomat in 
london where rushdie lives 
the 12 european economic community governments in a sharp blow 
to irans hopes of improving relations with western nations decided 
to recall their diplomats for consulations and suspend highlevel 
visits to and from iran 
they said they also will restrict the movement of iranian 
diplomats in their countries 
howe told a news conference that the eec foreign ministers 
meeting in brussels had sent a strong concerted signal to the 
iranian leadership that khomeinis threats are an affront to 
international standards of behavior and will not be tolerated 
for britains part he said it is no longer sensible to 
maintain a diplomatic presence in tehran 
he said irans charge daffaires in london mohammad basti would 
be summoned to hear the reasons for this action along with the 
implications for mr basti and his mission 
asked if that meant closing the iranian embassy he replied i 
leave it for your own conclusions 
in london basti was summoned and told of the decision but made 
no immediate comment 
rushdie 41 apologized saturday for any distress the publication 
of his book caused to moslems after iranian president ali khamenei 
indicated that an apology could lead to a pardon 
on sunday however irans official islamic republic news agency 
quoted khomeini as ruling out any reprieve for rushdie and urging 
moslems to send him to hell for his writings 
neither khomeinis statement nor irna referred to khameneis 
comments reflecting a widening rift in the iranian hierarchy over 
the rushdie affair 
there plainly is confusion amongst the iran authorities howe 
said 
he added however if the threat were turned into fact that 
would call for an even more serious response but i hope that it 
will not come to that 
irans deputy parliament speaker mehdi karrubi reaffirmed 
khomeinis execution order monday 
without doubt salman rushdie and those following the same 
line of thought have no other fate but death and destruction and 
banishment to hell karrubi said at a meeting at khomeinis home 
broadcast on iranian television the tv showed khomeini sitting 
impassively on a balcony above a crowd of several hundred men waving 
clenched fists and chanting death to america and long live 
khomeini 
rushdie an indianborn moslem has been in hiding reportedly 
under armed police guard since khomeini decreed feb 14 that he 
should be killed and two iranian religious leaders put a 52 
million bounty on his head 
in london archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual 
leader of anglicans worldwide appealed to britains moslem 
community to contain its anger 
commenting on the controversy for the first time runcie 
aknowledged the book had deeply offended moslems but he condemned 
the murder call and asked moslem leaders to have regard to the 
expression of profound regret that salman rushdie issued on 
saturday 
the swiss foreign ministry in bern called in irans ambassador to 
express concern about the death threat but did not plan to withdraw 
its ambassador from tehran said ministry spokesman lorenzo schnyder 
von wartensee 
howe said normal relations between britain and iran would be 
impossible until iran repudiates violence and respects other 
countries laws 
asked whether the latest rupture would worsen the plight of 
western hostages in lebanon and british businessman roger cooper 
who is jailed in tehran howe said nobody can pretend that it 
makes our task any easier 
britains embassy in tehran closed for eight years reopened in 
december 
the two countries had all but severed diplomatic relations in 
1987 following the arrest of an iranian diplomat for shoplifting in 
britain and the retaliatory beating of a british diplomat in iran 
moslems say the satanic verses portrays the prophet 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggests that he wrote rather 
than allah the koran islams holy book 
the novel is banned in pakistan bangladesh iran india egypt 
and south africa publishers in france west germany greece and 
turkey have canceled plans to publish it 
israels keter publishing house promised a hebrew edition within 
weeks and moslem leaders there vowed to block it 
an anonymous caller claiming to represent the guardians of the 
islamic revolution telephoned news agencies in london and threatened 
to kill howe and home secretary douglas hurd and bomb british 
airlines pubs discos and government offices the caller also 
threatened a british tv anchorman for exchanging sharp words with 
basti on the air 
the group also has claimed responsibility for the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 which killed 270 people when it exploded and crashed 
in lockerbie scotland on dec 21 
the head of irna in madrid said he was willing to kill rushdie 
ali akhbar jaban told the private cadena ser radio network that as 
far as i know there are at least 50 million iranians ready to do 
it himself among them 
in yugoslavia the official daily borba stopped printing a daily 
series of excerpts from the satanic verses in an apparent 
goodwill gesture toward khamenei who arrived monday in belgrade for 
a threeday visit

seven of the 110 guard troops on duty monday had nursing 
training the rest were given nonmedical tasks like feeding 
washing and dressing patients

quadriplegic who has been at the hospital for two years said of the 
job action number one should be the patients 
patient louise baran herself a registered nurse said she felt 
comfortable about the care being given and while she didnt fault

which stands for methylenedioxymethamphetamine was placed on the 
controlled substance list recently and the company was not aware of 
the change

ecstasy for the warm friendly feelings they say it produces it 
has been found to cause brain cell damage in animals conclusive 
studies on humans have not been done and scientists do not know 
precisely how it works 
the zdf television network reported monday night that if it is 
determined company officials knew the drug deal was illegal they 
would face more severe penalties for that offense than if they are 
convicted in the libyan affair

arrested in the case so far on suspicion of illegal production and 
delivery of a controlled substance 
botz said two of the suspects were american he said one was

the federal criminal investigation office in wiesbaden said the 
drug deal was one of the largest uncovered in recent years 
investigators are trying to determine whether the companys 
president juergen hippenstielimhausen was aware of the deal botz 
said 
police in lahr meanwhile said the condition of an imhausen 
official who apparently attempted suicide last week had improved 
they said imhausen executive hans renner was in stable condition

the trials of vaclav havel and 
other dissidents which open tuesday have caused protest in the 
east and emphasize the contrast between pragues rigid leadership 
and a more liberal kremlin 
those protests along with widespread criticism in the west 
apparently prompted the communist authorities to toughen laws on 
public order but also offer dialogue in an attempt to contain 
dissent 
havel a 52yearold banned playwright is czechoslovakias 
bestknown human rights activist 
he and the eight others being tried were arrested jan 16 during 
a week of protest honoring jan palach a student who burned himself 
alive in 1969 to protest the death of reform after the sovietled 
invasion of august 1968 
the january protests seemed to surprise the leaders moscow 
installed after alexander dubceks liberal prague spring a 
generation ago and underline their dilemma now that moscow is 
introducing many of the same reforms 
after the protests most of whose participants were in their 
teens and early 20s chief ideologist jan fojtik declared in a 
speech jan 25 that the communist party no longer could ignore 
dissent 
police violence that was used to suppress all but one of the 
protests also prompted uncustomary public criticism by intellectuals 
of the official establishment 
in an interview sunday havels brother ivan said more than 
2000 people had signed a petition calling for the release of all 
dissidents and a dialogue between the authorities and society 
a separate petition was sent to the government by scientists at 
about 70 institutes and even communist youth groups have made 
written protests of the police violence dissidents and other 
sources have reported privately 
the support is enormous and unexpected and i think the 
government is somewhat puzzled by the situation ivan havel said 
a new group called polishhungarian solidarity released its first 
statement sunday condemning the trials of havel and the other 
dissidents the statement signed by 21 prominent polish opposition 
figures and 11 hungarian activists was released in warsaw 
opposition activist jozef pinior said monday that the group 
created over the weekend will function like an existing 
organization linking the polish and czechoslovak opposition

efforts to secure the captives release but dont really know what 
is being done 
im cautiously optimistic john anderson brother of hostage 
terry anderson said at a news conference during a weekend of 
tributes to the hostages 
george bush both in his inaugural address and a press 
conference afterward without prompting brought up the hostage 
issue anderson of ocala fla said reagan never did once in 
four years 
when pressed on the issue at news conferences reagan invariably 
said the government was pursuing the matter but that it would be 
dangerous to talk about specifics 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press has been a hostage four years longer than any of 
the eight other americans being held by proiranian extremists in 
lebanon 
john anderson was joined by thomas cicippio of norristown pa

estelle ronneburg of boise idaho whose son jesse turner was 
taken hostage jan 24 1987 and elaine and david collett of new

bicentennial of the constitution committee 
all five wore yellow ribbons that read free the hostages and 
sat next to pictures of their hostage relative at the news 
conference 
i feel president bush has a little different attitude than 
reagan said cicippio 
cicippio said he felt former president reagan shied away from the 
hostage issue and that the government fails to keep relatives fully 
informed 
i hear from the state department about every two weeks 
cicippio said adding the news he receives from the government 
already has been in the media 
collett acknowledged that disclosing information about any plans 
aimed at gaining release of the hostages was tricky 
its very difficult collett said they cannot make public 
various things theyre doing theyre very sensitive issues

the soviet union on monday invited egypts 
president to moscow and scheduled meetings in the egyptian capital 
with israel and the plo in quest of a middle east peace conference 
but israeli foreign minister moshe arens told reporters after 90 
minutes of talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak that they 
made no progress on the key obstacle blocking a peace conference 
israels refusal to sit with the plo 
cairo was the focus of new peace efforts with the arrival sunday 
night of soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who is on a 
fivenation middle east tour 
he gave mubarak a letter from soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
extending an official and friendly invitation for the egyptian 
leader to visit moscow 
the message included some important presentation regarding a 
middle east settlement shevardnadze said in russian through an 
arabic interpreter he did not elaborate 
after chastising israel earlier for adopting a stubborn 
position shevardnadze was scheduled to meet with arens in cairo 
on wednesday there was a strong possibility he would meet with plo 
chairman yasser arafat separately on the same day 
israeli officials speaking on condition of anonymity stressed 
the soviet and israeli positions were not so far apart that they 
could not be bridged on the subject of an international peace 
conference 
shevardnadze proposed in damascus syria on saturday that the 
un security councils five permanent members convene a preparatory 
conference within nine months to arrange for arabisraeli 
negotiations 
israel has said it would agree to preparatory talks sponsored by 
the soviet union and the united states before direct negotiations 
between israel and its arab neighbors it has said the united 
nations also may play a role 
however israel has refused to talks with the plo which it 
contends is a terrorist organization bent on destroying the jewish 
state 
asked if progress was made in his talks with mubarak on the 
issue arens said on the plo there is no progress now 
but arens described his talks with mubarak as a very good 
exchange of views that took place in a cordial atmosphere 
egypts foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid called on israel to 
consider with an open mind and open heart the possibility of 
talking to the plo the palestinians he told reporters after the 
meeting have shown a greater deal of flexibility and a great deal 
of understanding 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir said in an unusually 
upbeat statement that he hoped arens meetings with mubarak and 
shevardnadze would foretell a breakthrough in the stagnated 
israeliegyptian relations and a normalization of israelisoviet 
ties 
maybe we are entering a more intensive stage in the middle east 
peace process shamir said in an interview broadcast on israel 
radios arabic service 
the soviet union broke relations with israel after the 1967 
middle east war and israel has said the soviet union may get 
involved in the peace process only on the condition that it resume 
ties with israel 
the soviets and israelis have permanent but lowlevel diplomatic 
missions in each others country but are represented by embassies of 
finland and the netherlands 
shevardnadze who first flew to jordan and syria is to visit 
iraq and iran before returning home feb 27 
he is the first soviet foreign minister to visit jordan and is 
the first highranking soviet official to visit egypt in 15 years

the canadian human rights commission on monday 
ordered the military to integrate women into combat units within the 
next 10 years 
the decision will have the force of law in 10 days if not 
appealed in federal court 
full integration is to take place with all due speed as a 
matter of principle and as a matter of practice for both active and 
reserve forces the threemember panel ruled 
the commission said the current policy of introducing women into 
combat units on a trial basis now should be considered preparation 
for full integration 
women usually serve in noncombat roles and make up about 9 
percent of canadas 85000member armed forces 
max yalden commission chairman said the there is no 
justification for keeping women out of any branch of the military 
yalden said that although the commission set a 10year deadline 
for integration 10 years is a long long time perhaps when 
they get down to the nittygritty theyll be able to do it a little 
more quickly 
capt doug martin said the defense department would not comment 
until it has studied the 78page judgment 
the canadian forces have been permitted women to join combat 
units in an effort to determine whether they would hamper combat 
effectiveness

central americans applying for asylum 
will get an answer in as little as one day and will be subject to 
immediate imprisonment if turned down officials said monday 
the immigration and naturalization service staff in southern 
texas will be increased by 500 to patrol the border and speed up the 
weeding out of frivolous asylum claims ins commissioner alan 
nelson announced 
more jails will be built to hold people who are turned down 
pending their appeal or deportation he said 
we intend to send a strong signal to those people who have the 
mistaken idea that by merely filing a frivolous asylum claim they 
may stay in the united states nelson said this willful 
manipulation of americas generosity must stop 
a group called the brownsville ad hoc refugee committee 
criticized the new ins policy as a meanspirited attempt to deter 
political refugees from applying for political asylum 
the policy will be phased in over the next several weeks nelson 
said the ins hopes eventually to process most asylum applications in 
the region in a day or two currently asylum decisions can take 
months 
we hope to have sameday service said ins spokeswoman 
virginia kice 
the changes came the same day the ins was allowed to reinstate a 
policy restricting people seeking asylum from leaving southern texas 
while they await decisions 
before dec 16 the ins allowed central american asylum seekers 
to check in at its south texas district then travel anywhere in the 
united states while their cases were reviewed but after that date 
the agency made them stay in the brownsville area during the review 
forcing them to live in tents and trying the patience of residents 
and relief agencies 
responding to a lawsuit filed by attorneys representing asylum 
seekers us district judge filemon vela issued a temporary order 
jan 9 requiring the ins to once more allow the central americans to 
travel he ruled friday that the ins could return to the policy of 
restricting their movement 
tens of thousands of central americans are expected to cross the 
rio grande into southern texas this year according to the ins 
which says political asylum requests from central americans have 
risen almost sevenfold over the past four years more than 50000 
sought asylum in fiscal year 1988 compared with 7063 in 1985 
according to ins records 3136 people applied for asylum between 
wednesday and sunday at the agencys port isabel processing center 
a rural detention center 15 miles northeast of brownsville the main 
entry point for asylumseekers from wartorn and povertystricken 
central america 
but ins officials maintain that most of the central americans are 
here for economic reasons and do not qualify for asylum from 
persecution 
robert rubin lead counsel in the lawsuit that led to the 
restraining order said ins detention should be the exception and 
not the rule for asylum seekers he said the united states should 
show a humanitarian spirit 
roughly half of the central americans seeking asylum are from 
nicaragua nelson said 
in a real sense said rubin in san francisco the ins has 
become a prisoner of its own policy and that policy as recently as 
1987 and 1988 was to encourage nicaraguans to come to the united 
states because they would be granted asylum 
now finally the united states appears to be overwhelmed by 
the numbers and it is no longer politically expedient to accept 
the nicaraguans 
under the new policy those denied asylum can either return 
immediately to their home countries or be given a hearing before an 
immigration judge where they may renew their applications for asylum 
nelson said he did not know how long it might take for a person 
to get that hearing before a judge 
i think were going to see detention in years said 
immigration lawyer linda yanez 
while they await deportation single adults will be detained at 
prisonlike ins detention centers family groups may be allowed to 
stay in lessrestrictive facilities that will be set up nelson said 
nelson said if more detention space were needed the agency could 
erect tents to house up to 5000 people within 10 days 
brownsville mayor ygnacio garza welcomed the plan from the 
standpoint of the city i think it will be good in terms of taking 
people and providing for them in a humanitarian way garza said 
although hundreds of hondurans nicaraguans salvadorans and 
guatemalans have camped outside the port isabel processing center in 
temperatures dropping into the 40s waiting to apply for asylum many 
have been grateful for their reception local residents have 
provided food and blankets 
we expected people at the border aiming rifles at us but the 
american people have been very kind very generous and we 
appreciate it said honduran marcio nunez as he ate a meal of rice 
and beans provided by members of a port isabel church 
in honduras we have a very bad concept of the united states 
because of all the mexican movies showing mean agents nunez 
added but you have been very generous

federal agents arrested an italian who 
allegedly directed cocaine shipments from mexico to the united 
states on behalf of colombias medellin cartel the attorney 
generals office said monday 
giuseppe catania ponsiglione alias pino catani was arrested 
saturday in ciudad juarez bordering el paso texas after agents 
seized more than a half ton of cocaine in chihuahua state said 
deputy attorney general javier coello trejo 
ponsiglione planned to receive the shipment of 1430 pounds of 
the unprocessed drug discovered on board a plane in the village of 
laguna seca near villahermosa in chihuahua a northern state coello 
told a news conference 
authorities said they arrested three of ponsigliones mexican 
associates as well as two colombians who piloted the plane 
agents determined that members of the medellin cartel sent the 
cocaine according to a statement released at the news conference 
in another development army troops and federal judicial police 
in the southern state of oaxaca on saturday seized a truck laden 
with more than 1600 pounds of cocaine stashed under a shipment of 
peanuts coello said 
coello said both shipments were destined for the united states 
and together would provide more than 9 million doses for cocaine 
users once refined he declined to estimate the street value of the 
drugs 
authorities were continuing an investigation to determine whether 
the two shipments were connected 
ponsiglione using the alias jose castaneda gutierrez posed as a 
businessman making mens shirts and jackets in mexico as a cover for 
his involvement with the medellin cartel the statement said 
coello said ponsiglione allegedly was linked to a heroin 
operation based in marseilles france that inspired the filming of 
a movie called white heroin 
mexican drug authorities were investigating a possible connection 
between ponsiglione and gilberto ontiveros lucero a mexican drug 
lord who was arrested jan 10 in ciudad juarez according to the 
statement 
ontiveros is under indictment in the united states according to 
us officials they maintain ontiveros is responsible for much of 
the cocaine that passes into the southwestern united states from 
mexico

john morrell amp co on monday imposed a 
contract cutting the wages of 2000 workers at its strifetorn 
meatpacking plant by up to 18 percent 
the union said it would not strike despite a nearunanimous vote 
against the contract which one leader said destroyed 50 years of 
bargaining 
the plant has long been a focus of discord with violent strikes 
lawsuits filed by management and the union and huge fines for 
safety violations 
there was no violence reported monday and business went on as 
usual according to gary junso a morrell official 
the old contract expired nov 20 and the company had renewed it 
on a daily basis but on thursday morrell declared that talks with 
the union had reached an impasse allowing it to impose its own 
contract 
members of the food and commercial workers union met on sunday 
and over 99 percent of those voting rejected the contract said 
jim lyons local president 
lyons said a strike would not be in the best interest of the 
union because it could negate back pay awards or unfair labor 
practice complaints more than half the plants workers are 
replacements hired during a 1987 strike 
the union said it would file a complaint of unfair labor 
practices against morrell on friday company officials said they 
had filed a national labor relations board complaint charging the 
union with badfaith bargaining 
the contract cuts base union wages at the plant from 975 an 
hour to 8 an hour benefits and seniority also were cut 
the fouryear contract virtually destroys 50 years of 
bargaining and will ruin the standard of living for morrell 
workers lyons said 
its probably the worst contract thats ever been put 
forward said worker bob stuerman we were at the top of the 
heap and that brings us down to the bottom 
the contract is not out of line with the meatpacking industry 
said raoul baxter morrell executive vice president if we really 
wanted to punish them we wouldve taken them down to 6 which is 
the real thing out there he said 
we would hope they would recognize our need to be competitive 
and make a recommendation to help us get there company negotiator 
brad johnson said sunday night but i see no reason for optimism 
more than 200 of the plants workers are union members who 
crossed picket lines thrown up in 1987 by striking workers from 
morrells plant at sioux city iowa about 600 union members were 
called back to work after the strike and more than 1100 replacement 
workers hired during the strike are on the payroll 
the replacements were making 925 before mondays cut 
in november an arbitrator ruled that the sympathy strike was 
legal that all strikers should be returned to work and that morrell 
owed more than 40 million in back pay morrell has challenged the 
award in federal court 
also last year a federal jury awarded the company 246 million 
in damages for what the panel decided were three illegal sympathy 
strikes 
morrell also is fighting a 43 million fine the largest ever 
against a single employer by the occupational safety and health 
administration 
the fine involved hundreds of serious injuries to hand and arm 
joints caused by the repetitive motion of the meatpacking line

former president george sokomanu went 
on trial monday with six others charged with mutiny and sedition in 
his failed bid last year to form an interim government in the south 
pacific island nation 
the charges carry a maximum of life imprisonment according to 
staterun radio vanuatu 
vanuatu formerly the new hebrides under british and french rule 
lies 1400 miles northeast of sydney australia it became 
independent in 1980 
supreme court proceedings began after a confrontation between 
security forces and the accused the australian associated press 
said 
at one stage about a dozen paramilitary troops in combat 
fatigues apparently threatened sokomanu by cocking their 
semiautomatic rifles when he initially refused a police order to 
take his seat in the courtroom it said 
the defendants have been held in port vila jail without bail 
since before christmas they arrived at the courthouse under heavy 
guard 
sokomanu who was dismissed from office last month complained 
that only foreign journalists were allowed to attend the trial 
which is expected to last a week 
the government of prime minister walter lini issued a statement 
earlier on radio vanuatu warning the public to stay away among 
those attending are diplomats from australia britain and new 
zealand 
the seven are charged with inciting mutiny within vanuatus 
security forces after sokomanu tried to dissolve parliament and to 
replace linis elected government with an interim administration 
headed by his nephew barak sope 
they also face charges of sedition conspiracy and taking 
unlawful oaths 
accused are sokomanu sope former opposition leader maxime 
carlot former members of parliament willy jimmy john naupa and 
frank spooner and john kalotiti a former presidential private 
secretary 
most of mondays proceedings were taken up by legal argument no 
pleas were made 
the attempted coup in december followed a yearlong power struggle 
between lini and sope sokomanu admitted at the time he was acting 
unconstitutionally he said the interim government would have called 
elections within two months 
he said he acted because the island economy was in shambles and 
lini was unfit to govern following a stroke sokomanu like lini 
took office in 1980

a political accord in el salvador is not 
possible without a significant delay in next months elections a 
salvadoran guerrilla commander said monday 
agreeing to a delay could mean a permanent end to combat the 
commander shafick handal said before meeting with representatives 
of salvadoran political parties 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front offered on 
jan 24 to take part in elections and recognize the results if they 
are postponed until september and if other electoral changes are 
made to guarantee a fair vote 
salvadoran political parties taking part in the march 19 vote 
agreed to meet in mexico even though the rebel proposal has been 
virtually rejected as unconstitutional by president jose napoleon 
duarte and by the armed forces 
handal a member of the farabundo marti general command declared 
on monday that acceptance of the rebel offer would mean the end of 
the armed struggle in a permanent way 
he said failure to reach an accord would prompt a new wave of 
violence in el salvador 
the us state department has said the plan is worthy of 
serious and substantive consideration several us legislators 
said the guerrilla offer could be an important development in the 
search for an end to the 9yearold civil war which has killed 
about 70000 people mostly civilians 
handal and fellow commander roberto roca spoke to reporters 
before the meeting began no comment came from representatives of 
the political parties 
he said the elections did not have to be delayed until september 
but any postponement must be long enough for us to genuinely 
participate in the elections 
handal warned that without a postponement there is no 
possibility of an accord he said the rebels rejected the 
constitutional objections offered by duarte and the armed forces 
even though the constitution says a new president must take office 
on june 1 
if there are elections on march 19 against the broad popular 
will that has been formed in the country to support this opportunity 
for peace surely we will see much agitation among the people the 
guerrilla commander said 
asked if the rebels were willing to lay down their weapons 
handal replied the problem is not laying down arms the problem 
is resolving the armed conflict 
the fact that the meeting was taking place at all was considered 
a victory for the guerrillas who long sought direct talks with the 
political parties 
the site was the hotel tepozteco part of a mexican 
governmentrun resort complex in morelos state about 40 miles 
southeast of the mexican capital the meetings were to be held 
monday and tuesday 
security was relaxed at the resort which is dominated by the 
picturesque snowcapped volcanic peaks of popocatepetl and 
iztaccihuatl 
the talks were taking place against a background of rising 
violence in el salvador the guerrillas mounted few attacks for

a train hauling explosives and hazardous materials hit a broken 
section of rail east of san francisco sending 48 cars off the 
tracks monday and two ruptured tankers from a derailed train in 
north dakota spewed noxious gas 
there were no reports of serious injuries in the derailments in 
manteca calif and in bordulac nd officials said 
at manteca a san joaquin valley town of 25000 about three 
dozen cars including the four carrying the explosives remained on 
the tracks authorities said they asked residents to leave as a 
precaution although there was no fire or leak 
the 100150 residents who evacuated were expected to be allowed 
back home by tuesday morning but police said it could take two days 
to complete the cleanup 
nobody was injured when the train en route from houston to 
oakland derailed just before 6 am police said 
police capt dennis hoerth said the derailed cars included an 
empty chlorine tanker and another car carrying an unspecified 
hydrocarbon residue 
the four cars carrying munitions were marked as containing class 
a projectile explosives but neither hoerth nor southern pacific 
spokesman jim loveland knew specifically what types of munitions

homes no serious injuries were reported but hospital officials said 
two people were admitted for observation after inhaling the gas

more than 100 us soldiers and 
civilians were transferred out of offbase housing because the 
panamanian governments power company cut off their electricity a 
us army spokesman said monday 
the army had not paid the power company 340245 it owed in 
electric bills since last april because of us sanctions southern 
command spokesman bill ormsbee said instead the money was 
deposited into an account in new york 
sanctions imposed by former president reagan forbid paying the 
government controlled by armed forces commander manuel antonio 
noriega who ousted president eric arturo delvalle last year in 
favor of manuel solis palma 
southern command transferred the residents of 80 rented homes in 
balboa and diablo onto a us military base near the panama canal 
ormsbee said 
he said the decision to make the transfer and terminate a rental 
agreement for the homes was made saturday after the government power 
company cut the electricity 
the housing in diablo and balboa was once part of the panama 
canal zone controlled by the united states but was among the areas 
that have reverted to panamanian control under the panama canal 
treaties of 1977 
the united states still has about 13000 troops in panama but is 
due to turn over its bases and full control of the canal at the end 
of 1999 
delvalle tried to fire noriega as commander of the panamanian 
defense forces last year after noriega was indicted on 
drugtrafficking charges in florida 
instead noriega who holds real power in panama got rid of 
delvalle 
noriega denied the drug charges and said that they and the effort 
to oust him are part of a us plot to violate the treaties and 
maintain control of the canal 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as the legitimate 
president of panama although he has had no power since noriega 
ousted him in february 1988

floodweary kentucky got another soaking monday as heavy rain 
raised new fears of flash flooding and many western tennessee 
rivers remained above flood stage and kept people from their homes 
the national weather service predicted up to 3 inches of rain on 
kentucky through wednesday morning and issued a flash flood watch 
for the entire state saying new rain could not be absorbed by the 
already saturated ground soaked by last weeks heavy rain that 
pushed rivers out of their banks 
but rivers in western kentucky posed the greatest problems 
because of backwater flooding from the swollen ohio river officials 
said 
the kentucky and licking rivers could take that precipitation 
and not get back to flood stage but the salt and green rivers are 
still up in some places and are back up from the lower ohio river 
said mike murphy a hydrologic technician at the weather service 
office in louisville 
in western tennessee about 130 people were still unable to 
return to their homes in obion county where nearly 400 were 
displaced last week said cecil whaley an operations officer for 
the tennessee emergency management agency 
he said the obion river was beginning to recede but that another 
inch or so of rain could send the water back into evacuated houses 
and could cause flooding in some previously untouched places as well 
heavy rain was scattered over parts of western tennessee during 
the afternoon 
tennessee gov ned mcwherter on monday made obion county the 
ninth county for which he has requested federal federal disaster 
assistance to allow lowinterest loans for those affected by the 
flooding said spokesman ken renner 
in other flooded areas along the cumberland river in central 
tennessee people who evacuated their homes last week would probably 
not be seriously affected by additional rain whaley said 
in those places an inch or two might not be too bad in their 
situations he said it takes about 30 to 40 hours after the 
rain hits for them to feel the effects on the cumberland if it only 
lasts 24 hours it may not be too bad of an effect on them 
along kentuckys northern border the ohio river apparently 
crested during the night at louisville 34 feet above flood level 
murphy said 
also the western kentucky parkway was reopened early monday 
said spokesman don armstrong of the state division of disaster and 
emergency services the parkway the major highway from 
elizabethtown to eddyville had been closed by high water between 
elizabethtown and leitchfield

the opposition progressive labor party 
on monday demanded a public inquiry into a suspected violation of 
foreign exchange control laws by a director of bermudas monetary 
authority 
edgar wilkinson director of the bermuda monetary authority was 
stopped feb 11 at bermuda airport as he was about to board a flight 
to new york police seized some us currency he was carrying but 
did not bring charges 
the bermuda monetary authority is a semiautonomous government 
agency that performs the role of a central bank in the british 
colony 
police have refused to confirm or deny reports that they are 
investigating a possible breach of currency rules that forbid 
bermudians to take more than 5000 abroad with them unless they 
have received official permission 
wilkinson thought to have committed a minor technical breach of 
the regulations is believed to have resigned from the authority 
last week the report has not been confirmed 
progressive labor party spokesman julian hall called for a 
explanation of what he said was the apparent failure of the 
police to follow standard procedure and open a case 
hall a criminal lawyer said the failure suggested that exchange 
control regulations were being enforced against all except those 
responsible for enforcing them 
the bermuda monetary authority has refused to comment on the 
affair but in launching a new series of banknotes monday to mark 
its 20th anniversary the authority said the only bill not being 
released was the 5 bill the only one of seven banknotes that was 
to have carried wilkinsons signature 
the authority said a new 5 note would be issued later this year 
earlier it issued an advance release showing the design of the 
new bill complete with wilkinsons signature and dated feb 20 
wilkinson flew to australia feb 17 and is not expected to return 
to bermuda for about six weeks 
wilkinson who was also treasurer to the governing united bermuda 
party until his sudden resignation on feb 14 could pose the first 
real political test of the new administration since the feb 9 
general elections 
the election saw the united bermuda party and premier john swan 
returned to power but with considerably less popular support than 
before and with fewer seats in the colonys parliament

a plane flown by a student pilot wearing 
blinders collided with another aircraft over the adirondacks 
killing five people including three youngsters on a birthday 
outing authorities said monday 
bruce parent chief investigator for the warren county sheriffs 
department said monday the two planes glanced off of each other 
before crashing a mile apart in a logging area about 45 miles north 
of albany 
peter murray the pilot and lone survivor of the crash sunday 
afternoon was learning to fly by instruments only and was wearing a 
visor that permitted him to see no more than the dashboard parent 
said 
murray 64 told authorities his singleengine plane hit 
something moments before it crashed parent said he was was found 
near the wreckage with severe burns and was in serious condition at 
cornell medical center in new york city 
a coast guard plane using infrared search equipment found the 
other plane a singleengine aircraft dating from the 1940s with no 
survivors 
killed in that plane were pilot loughran boggs 46 james wells 
16 his 15yearold sister jackie and 12yearold sister rebecca 
parent said boggs had taken the youngsters on a flight in honor of 
jackie wells birthday 
murrays flight instructor willard osterhout 60 was pronounced 
dead at the scene 
inspectors from the federal aviation administration and the 
national tranportation safety board examined wreckage of the planes 
they said they expected to have a preliminary report out by the end 
of the week and that it would be six to eight months before the 
investigation is completed 
its tough because of the extensive damage said reuben l 
densley an ntsb investigator 
he said investigators didnt find any evidence of a visor but 
said it could have been destroyed in the fire 
pilots describe training with a visor as being under the 
hood they say its a common training practice during which pilots 
learn to rely on their instruments for times when they may encounter 
poor visibility 
although the student pilot can only see the instrument panel the 
instructor has full view of the panel and whats outside the planes

former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone on monday 
denied direct involvement in the stockprofiteering scandal that is 
threatening the government of his successor noboru takeshita 
nakasone was premier from 198287 when the socalled recruit 
scandal was taking shape the opposition has increasingly centered 
its attacks on him in parliament but his first public comment came 
late monday in an interview with cbs television 
i am not at all involved in such an affair as they allege 
nakasone replied when asked if he would testify before parliament if 
called 
nakasone said opposition questions on the scandal do not rest on 
firm ground but he said he would go along with parliament and his 
governing liberal democratic party if summoned to testify 
earlier monday the opposition spelled out in parliament its 
suspicions of impropriety in the way the recruit co bought a 
usmade supercomputer from nippon telegraph and telephone co 
during the nakasone administration 
katsusuke ozawa of the japan socialist party said he suspected 
nakasone could have influenced the deal which helped recruit an 
informationbased conglomerate establish itself in the business of 
leasing computer time and related telecommunications services 
nakasone is one of about 150 politicians bureaucrats and 
business leaders who benefited when recruit distributed 
bargainpriced shares in a recruit subsidiary in 1986 before the 
shares were listed for public sale the shares more than doubled in 
value giving the holders fat profits three nakasone aides 
reportedly were among those who profited 
takeshita who succeeded nakasone in late 1987 has seen his 
popularity slump and his party lose one local election after another 
since the scandal broke last summer 
opposition parties demanded monday that takeshita submit 
documents showing alleged trading by a former aide and a relative in 
recruit shares but takeshita declined to say in parliament that he 
would present the documents 
takeshita has pledged a broad effort to reform political ethics 
before elections next july for half the seats in the upper house 
the house of councilors where the liberal democrats hold 143 of the 
252 seats 
nakasone told cbs his party regretted that there may have been 
a lack of cautiousness on our part and that we did not exercise due 
oversight 
he added but as far as we are concerned while there may have 
been a lack of oversight it is not a criminal case 
no politicians have been arrested in the bribery probe but eight 
officials of recruit nippon telegraph and telephone and government 
ministries have been taken into custody for questioning 
nakasone said the situation would become clearer as prosecutors 
continue their work 
i think we should wait for the results by the prosecutors and 
then on the basis of that address the matter accordingly he said

a us navy captain 
testified tuesday he would have taken vietnamese refugees aboard his 
ship had he been correctly informed of how desperate they were 
un officials said the refugees later resorted to cannibalism to 
survive 
capt alexander balian 48 of los angeles has been on trial by 
navy court martial since feb 10 for allegedly failing to render 
adequate assistance to more than 80 vietnamese refugees whom his 
ship the uss dubuque encountered in the south china sea on june 9 
thirtyone of the refugees died after encountering the dubuque 
and survivors resorted to cannibalism before they were rescued by 
filipino fishermen june 27 after 37 days at sea un officials said 
his voice choked with emotion balian testified that he ordered 
his executive officer lt cmdr stanley halter to investigate the 
refugee boat determine if it had a working engine and decide if it 
was seaworthy 
i never got an indication about that engine so i said you 
got to know about that engine he said finally the report came 
back no engine and i surmised they had a good sail 
balian said he pressed halter to recommend the vessels 
seaworthiness and was told they felt they could make it on their 
own if we gave them food and water which were provided 
balian said if he had known the desperate conditions aboard the 
vietnamese craft there is no doubt in my mind i would tow them to 
my side and embark them thats what i did on two previous 
occasions 
balian was relieved of command of the dubuque in august after the 
vietnamese reported the incident to un officials in the 
philippines 
on thursday balian was acquitted of one of three charges 
failing to render assistance to a vietnamese who drowned 
the defendant on tuesday also denied allegations that he ordered 
crew members not to throw life rings to some of the vietnamese who 
swam toward the ship or to shake some of them from the ships lines 
he said he did order an interpreter to tell swimmers to move away 
for fear they would be sucked into the ships propellers 
balian also denied previous testimony by a crew member chief 
petty officer luis ilano that he had advised the vietnamese simply 
to follow the sun to reach land 
balian said he ordered the vietnamese interpreter to give the 
refugees a navigational chart and mark their present position

a brown university medical students 
experiment to see how the damaged bones of rats heal in space will 
be launched aboard the space shuttle discovery next month 
i feel the experiment is going to provide hard practical 
information for understanding some of the problems of bone structure 
in space said andre fras a secondyear medical student adding 
it will address the pretty predictable possibility that somebody 
will sustain some injury up there 
fras 21 won a national aeronautics and space administration 
contest to design an experiment to be flown aboard the shuttle in 
1981 when he was in 10th grade 
the experiment along with another proposed by a student is just 
now getting off the ground the explosion of the shuttle challenger 
in january 1986 delayed the launch of the rats fras said 
four caged rats whose bones will be surgically cut will be 
checked to see if the bones have properly healed after spending five 
days in space 
i also feel that we know so little about the bone healing 
process even on earth that getting a new angle on that process 
would be very valuable fras said 
nasa is spending 88000 to launch the rats fras is working with 
researchers at the university of southern california orthopaedic 
hospital 
five days before the launch of discovery now set for midmarch 
fras will fly to the johnson space center in houston to prepare the 
rats a small bone less than the width of a pencil lead will be 
severed in each animal while the rats are under anesthesia fras 
said 
one group of rats remains on the ground as a control group and 
four others will be placed in a cage that automatically provides 
food and water the cage will be placed on the lower deck of the 
shuttle where the astronauts eat and sleep said nasa spokeswoman 
billie a deason 
after the shuttle lands the rats will be killed with an overdose 
of anesthesia so their bones can be examined 
bone deterioration in the weightlessness of space remains a major 
roadblock to longterm missions officials say soviet cosmonauts 
who spent six months in space had to be removed from their 
spacecraft on stretchers 
fras has won the space science student involvement program twice 
his other experiment launched in 1985 examined how brain cells age 
in weightlessness

more than 400 people crammed into a bar to pay 
tribute to everette hawthorne maddox one of the citys most 
acclaimed poets who died homeless last week at age 44 
a jazz band sunday led the gathering of friends poets and 
college professors into the streets playing a closer walk with 
thee didnt he ramble and just a little while to stay 
here 
maddox who died feb 13 in charity hospital from complications 
of alcoholism was eulogized at the maple leaf bar where the former 
university teacher had organized weekly poetry readings 
fred kasten a disc jockey at wwno radio talked of maddoxs 
kindness his selfeffacing nature and his razorsharp ability to 
pop what was pompous and pretentious 
kasten passed an empty beer pitcher for donations for maddoxs 
cremation with any surplus going to a shelter for the homeless 
bob wolff a boyhood friend from alabama quoted from a letter in 
which maddox said my life is a museum of consolation prizes 
maddox whose writing was published in the new yorker when he was 
only 25 felt he failed to live up to that early success although he 
published three volumes of poems coedited a poetry anthology and 
had his work accepted by the paris review and north american review 
his work drew critical acclaim but earned little money and his 
teaching career ended in 1978 when the university of new orleans 
laid him off during cutbacks his marriage fell apart the same year 
wolff recounted 
maddox once wrote a poem called hypothetical selfepitaph 
what if i just caved in gave out pulled over to the side of 
the road of life expired like an old drivers license

president bush on monday concluded after 
reading a final fbi report on embattled defense secretarydesignate 
john tower that there was nothing in the files to derail towers 
nomination the white house said 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush went over the 
140page report on tower a former us senator from texas during 
an oval office meeting with white house counsel c boyden gray 
gray went to capitol hill late monday to present the report to 
sens sam nunn dga and john warner rva the ranking members 
of the armed services committee 
the report shows no reason why sen tower should not be 
confirmed in our judgment fitzwater told reporters as the dinner 
hour approached 
the president urges that sen tower be confirmed as soon as 
possible fitzwater said 
well let the senators read the report and make their own 
judgment the press secretary said 
fitzwater said the fbi report was very exhaustive and said 
that the document was sent unaltered to the armed services committee 
leaders 
it did not corroborate the personal charges of womanizing and 
excessive drinking against the senator nor did it show any 
problems with illegal campaign contributions fitzwater told 
reporters 
he said that nunn and warner are welcome to keep the report and 
read it at their convenience but made it clear the white house 
believes that towers nomination should be recommended favorably by 
the committee and approved by the full senate 
fitzwater said that gray phoned bush at camp david md in the 
early afternoon and discussed the report briefly with the president 
and then had a fuller discussion with bush in the oval office 
on his return to the white house from the presidential retreat 
bush gave a thumbsup sign when asked about towers prospects but 
the president did not comment 
fitzwater said the report focused on the last remaining 
allegations against tower he said that bush agreed with 
boydens conclusion that there was no reason in that report that 
sen tower should not be confirmed 
nunn and warner met into the night after gray delivered the 
report and later avoided reporters as he left 
theres a lot to go over warner said as he made one of 
several trips between the committee office and his own office 
spokesmen for both nunn and warner said the senators would have 
nothing further to say for the night 
the report examined allegations on towers drinking habits 
female companions and campaign contributions according to unnamed 
white house officials cited in tuesdays editions of the new york 
times the report said no evidence of misbehavior was found 
although it did say tower had a drinking problem in the early 1970s 
that came about after his first marriage broke up 
earlier armed services committee staff members met with berne 
indahl a state department security officer sent to geneva in 1986 
to investigate allegations of security breaches in the us 
delegation to missile talks with the soviet union while tower was a 
member of the contingent said congressional sources who requested 
anonymity 
on sunday indahl had spoken to investigators of a house 
subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations 
against tower at that meeting the sources said indahl 
corroborated a report that tower while in geneva had used his 
secretaries as mistresses 
the sources would not go into detail on what indahl told the 
house committee 
the fbi presented its latest report on allegations into towers 
personal and business affairs to gray early monday afternoon bush 
was briefed on the new report said white house sources who 
requested anonymity 
the committee may vote this week on the embattled nomination but 
nunn and warner said they will not schedule a vote until all the 
evidence is in 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine promised a 
speedy vote on the nomination once it leaves the committee 
mitchell interviewed over the weekend said that he has not read 
the fbi reports but that the allegations surrounding towers private 
life are an appropriate subject of inquiry because of the 
importance of the defense post 
not so said senate minority leader bob dole rkan who told 
reporters sunday he has read the earlier fbi reports seen nothing 
that would disqualify tower and suggested moving ahead on the 
nomination 
i think we should stop checking every rumor unless theres 
some criminal activity lets get on with the vote dolesaid 
while eleven of president bushs choices for cabinet posts have 
sailed through the confirmation process towers selection ran into 
a maelstrom fueled by rounds of allegations about the former 
senators personal and business affairs 
charges surfaced that tower drinks excessively and is a 
womanizer many senators also expressed concerns about their former 
colleagues close ties to defense contractors tower received more 
than 1 million as a consultant for major defense firms since he 
left the senate in 1985 
meanwhile a house subcommittee continued its investigation into 
security at nuclear weapons facilities run by the energy department 
an inquiry that has turned up allegations about tower 
the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations obtained parts of an office of personnel management 
report on a probe into the activities of a us arms control 
delegation in geneva while tower served as a negotiator 
for seven hours sunday the subcommittee questioned indahl who 
corroborated the allegations against tower and brought the whole 
thing into focus said a congressional source 
indahl is scheduled to go before the panel again in an executive 
session on wednesday the committee is chaired by rep john dingell 
dmich 
also scheduled to testify is john grassle who allegedly made the 
charges against tower to indahl grassle was quoted last week by 
knightridder as saying he did not make such allegations 
from january 1985 to april 1986 tower served as a negotiator for 
the us delegation at talks with the soviet union on longrang 
missile reductions 
nunn has said an investigation of towers actions in geneva found 
no security breaches 
last week nunn raised the possibility that if senators raise 
questions about towers personal life the lawmakers have to meet in 
a rare closed session 
i hope not but it depends on the type of questions posed on 
the senate floor by senators who are not members of the senate armed 
services committee he said 
a closed session of the full senate is highly unusual occurring 
on average about once a year and usually relating to national 
security issues the last closed session was march 29 1988 when 
the senate met to discuss the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty with the soviet union 
in other matters on capitol hill this week 
the senate veterans affairs committee is to take up bushs 
nomination of edward j derwinski to head the new department of 
veterans affairs 
the presidents fiscal 1990 budget will be up for discussion 
when house and senate leaders visit the white house on tuesday the

a freshman legislator said monday he will 
challenge the seating of former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke 
when the legislature convenes in a special session this week 
in metairie the nearly allwhite suburb of new orleans where 
duke was elected a lawyer who convened a private meeting monday 
night said that a group of citizens would sue questioning dukes 
residency if the legislators challenge failed 
the ultimate decision has been deferred until tomorrow 
lawyer david sherman said after the meeting declining to say how 
many attended it appears that there will be a legislative 
challenge in my opinion that would be a better forum if we feel 
the matter will not be heard there we will file suit 
duke 38 defeated homebuilder and longtime republican john 
treen 63 in saturdays election for a seat in the louisiana house 
despite endorsements for treen from president bush former president 
reagan and powerful political figures in suburban new orleans 
workers at dukes headquarters said he could not be reached for 
comment on the challenge 
rep odon bacque the only registered independent in the house 
said he will challenge dukes seating on grounds that duke did not 
live in the district for a year as required by law 
opponents said utility records showed dukes condominium had no 
electricity for the first six months he said he lived there they 
noted papers he filed during his 1988 presidential campaign listed a 
different address outside the district 
duke has said he did indeed live in the district and on sunday 
dismissed further questions as frivolous 
opponents were unable to get dukes name off the ballot before 
the election because state law limits such challenges to 10 days 
after a candidate signs up to run duke is scheduled to be swornin 
on wednesday 
bacque said several legislators have tried to persuade him to 
change his mind because the publicity would hurt the state some 
things are right and some things are wrong he said i have no 
problem with him being elected if he did it the right way 
rep avery c alexander a civil rights leader and past president 
of the southern christian leadership conference said monday that he 
planned to meet with duke to discuss his legislative plans before 
deciding whether to back any challenge 
meanwhile gov buddy roemer in his first public statement on 
the election said it reflected the will of the voters in the 
district 
in a democracy that fact must be respected regardless of what 
one might think personally about david dukes philosphical 
principles he said 
while i dont agree with him philosophically he is only one 
member of a 144member legislative body and has the obligation to 
his constituents to act responsibly within that body 
the twoweek special session was called by roemer to deal with 
the states financial problems

are the spotted owls that live in the ancient

victimized by the miniature radio transmitters that scientists use 
to track their movements 
biologists now are debating that question as a result of an 
unexpectedly high mortality rate among young owls outfitted with 
radio transmitters the scientists are also trying to determine 
whether the devices interfere with adult owls ability to reproduce

since the early 1980s wildlife biologists have been strapping

danny bonaduce used to have a rule no 
autographs while hes eating times change and so does the 
celebrity the former partridge family star has learned 
in the 14 years since he stopped playing the smartaleck danny 
partridge autograph hounds have been few and bonaduce finds that 
he welcomes them come up and you can have my dinner and ill sign 
for you 
at 29 bonaduce is back with his wisecracks and a deeper voice as 
a latenight disc jockey on wegxfm the philadelphia markets 
hottest rock station 
im real visible in philadelphia and i like it said 
bonaduce a media hit these days i love being here and getting 
all this attention im totally into this 
so is the station 
the man has contributed in publicity more than any disc jockey 
on any radio station ive ever seen said wegx programming 
director charlie quinn who put bonaduce on the air dec 5 with no 
experience but with another deejay around to help out 
less than three months into his first radio job bonaduce is no 
2 in his 10 pm to 2 am slot which he opens each night with the 
partridge family theme song under orders he says 
hes not the pudgy little kid he once was but the trademark red 
hair and familiar features make it easy to identify bonaduce who 
turned to tv and radio guest appearances and restaurant work after 
his partridge family days 
the partridge family ran on abctv from 197074 and starred 
shirley jones as the head of a family that becomes a rock n roll 
band the show also featured susan dey and david cassidy 
on the air while still trying to master the technical equipment 
surrounding him he lives off his wit 
often as not it aint funny but too bad i dont want to have 
a fake show he said 
recently divorced he called his exwife in los angeles his first 
night on the job on the air 
i called her up and demanded custody of the dog he said 
she didnt find the humor 
since then hes held a ted bundy request hour the night the 
serial killer was executed in florida receiving such song ideas as 
hurts so good and shock the monkey 
yes hes heard from the front office a couple times 
ive had to tone it down by request bonaduce said im not 
anywhere near the hit that im unfireable 
he definitely jumps off the edge on some things quinn 
said the man obviously never knew who the fcc is 
few begin a deejay career in a market this size quinn said but 
bonaduce offered the station publicity and is regarded as a serious 
member of the wegx lineup 
i think they hired me at first because id be interesting 
bonaduce said now ive got a semipopular show on my hands 
bonaduce actually had been looking for deejay work among the 
stations on which he did guest shots there were no takers 
they apparently thought i couldnt pull it off he said 
the key quinn said is that most stations thought about bonaduce 
stepping into an allcomedy role 
i took it a different direction quinn said i put him into 
a nighttime disc jockey role and actually trained him to be a disc 
jockey first and a celebritycomedian second so far i think that 
hes coming along real nicely hes gotten better and better by the 
day 
hes still new enough at it that he takes an exaggerated bow to a 
studio visitor after ending one song and starting another smoothly 
on the air he gets a reassuring word from his fiancee debbie 
strauss with whom he became engaged this month she sometimes helps 
in the studio even though she hates his date the dj contest on 
thursday nights when he records and airs womens calls with ideas 
for a hot date such as being buried in chocolatechip cookies 
bonaduce knows he has work ahead 
theres more to learn theres more finesse the finesse i 
certainly dont have down he said 
hes also not kissing off television his fiveyear run as danny 
partridge ended at age 15 rerun royalties ended seven years later

gennady resnikov waited nine years to get 
out of the soviet union now he is in italy waiting to get to the 
united states 
resnikov is a new arrival in this seaside workingclass town 
where about 5000 other soviet jews wait to get us visas he is 
optimistic 
it is my great luck that i have things that other people dont 
have he said 
he has american newspaper clippings that identify him as a 
refusenik and critic of the kremlin proof he hopes that he 
merits refugee status and a visa 
still resnikov and the others know that there are too many of 
them and too few visas 
i struggled for nine years to get out i struggled fought and 
organized many demonstrations said resnikov an electrochemist 
from moscow 
we organized so many news conferences my american friends told 
us we were so brave now i have to prove my past 
once permission to go to the united states was almost automatic 
for soviet jews but mikhail s gorbachev who came to power in 
1985 opened the tap on what had been just a trickle of jewish 
emigration from the soviet union 
relief officials say the number of soviet jews passing through 
italy the main processing point for soviet refugees to america 
rose from 600 in 1986 to 17000 last year officials say 38000 to 
50000 will come this year 
the united states has agreed to accept 24500 refugees from all 
of eastern europe including the soviet union however others will 
be accepted if they find sponsors in the united states 
the main idea is waiting and waiting hoping something will 
change that the american government will change its mind said 
sam nimeroski 60 who arrived in late november and has been 
rejected twice for an american visa 
many of the 5000 soviet jews currently in ladispoli and about 
2000 in other towns near rome will get us visas 
meanwhile most live only on the money they get from the american 
jewish joint distribution committee a private jewish relief 
organization but it is running out of money 
nimeroski said he his wife ludmilla and their 3yearold son 
stanislav receive the equivalent in italian lire of about 593 a 
month of that they pay 407 rent for a threeroom apartment shared 
with two other families 10 people in all 
compared to other refugees the soviet jews in ladispoli live 
pretty well say officials of the joint distribution committee they 
live in apartments rather than camps or cheap hotels they have a 
community center and their own schools where classes are taught in 
russian an old movie house near the center of town has been 
converted into a synagogue 
some food stores post signs in russian and a few merchants have 
learned some russian phrases 
but deputy mayor enzo paliotta says the refugees have overtaxed 
public services in this town of 16500 about 25 miles from rome 
silvia hassenfeld president of the joint committee said the 
organization has temporarily stopped sending refugees here because 
of that 
while they wait scores of soviets gather each day near the 
fountain in the central piazza vittoria 
among our people there is only one topic leaving for 
america said mrs nimeroski it is very difficult to talk about 
this all day because it is a very unpleasant topic 
relief officials say they have no other appeal if they are turned 
down for a visa and their only recourse is finding a sponsor in 
america 
i have no relatives in the united states nobody will pay for 
me said nimeroski who was an educational administrator in 
tashkent 
he said he was persecuted as a jew in the soviet union but 
believes us officials rejected him because he had been a communist 
party member 
they told me you were never in siberia nobody beat you you 
are not a refusenik you are just a man 
i couldnt live in the country as a jew said nimeroski i 
escaped from this country what is my blame 
all the jewish refugees could go easily to israel under the law 
of return said uri benzion the distribution committees director 
of educational and social life programs here 
but benzion and others say many of the refugees know almost 
nothing about the jewish faith and feel no special tie to israel 
italy has no limit on how long they can stay but it accepts them 
on condition they will eventually move on they are not allowed to 
get jobs while in teh country however 
some soviet jews who have failed to get us visas apply to go to 
other countries some select australia or canada while others might 
seek entry into another west european country 
because the distribution committee is running out of money it is 
considering options other than the arrangement in ladispoli such as 
refugee camps and is asking the refugees to seek financial help 
from friends and relatives 
we are also suggesting to them that israel is a very viable 
option said ms hassenfeld

history long ago passed macao by but the portuguese 
administrators of this speck on chinas southern coast have grand 
plans for the final decade of their rule 
they talk enthusiastically of transforming macao with the 
addition of an international airport and other major construction 
before the portuguese flag is lowered in 1999 and sovereignty 
returns to china critics wonder however if the projects are 
feasible 
macao was settled in 1557 as the first european foothold in east 
asia and for generations the main entrepot for western trade with 
china now it exists in the shadow of hong kong the thriving 
british colony 40 miles to the northeast 
as hong kong parlayed its spectacular deepwater harbor to become 
one of the great shipping and financial centers of the world 
macaos own waters filled up with silt a fleet of hydrofoils 
jetfoils and ferries that connects the two colonies provides the 
only practical transportation links to macao 
the portuguese enclave has evolved into a gamblers paradise with 
several casinos a jai alai palace and tracks for dog and horse 
racing it also manufactures textiles toys and artifical flowers 
for export 
despite a smattering of new hotels and office towers macao 
retains the flavor of the old world with its numerous rundown 
colonialstyle buildings 
but on the drawing board for the sixsquaremile territory is 
construction of the international airport a new harbor and a new 
town for macaos two sleepy islands of taipa and coloane after 
years of talk the government says work is finally starting 
the projects are designed to prepare some stability in macao 
before and after 1999 when the enclave becomes a special 
administrative region of china said undersecretary for major 
projects luis macedo pinto de vasconcelos 
in negotiations with portugal that concluded two years ago 
beijing promised macao can maintain its capitalist system for 50 
years and maintain a high degree of autonomy after 1999 a similar 
arrangement has been made for hong kong after it reverts to chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 
the new projects also should help this territory of about 500000 
people only about 10000 of them portuguese have its own 
identity and not have such a dependence on hong kong vasconcelos 
said 
the key to macaos plans is the airport which will have a single 
runway either on landfill or piling set in the ocean work is set to 
begin this spring and the 450million first phase is scheduled for 
completion in 1993 with the capacity to handle 3 million passengers 
a year vasconcelos said in an interview 
he added that the airport will increase the flow of tourism and 
help integrate macao with the adjacent pearl river delta one of 
chinas most prosperous regions 
but international airports already exist in hong kong and the 
chinese city of canton about 100 miles to the north the nearby 
chinese special economic zone of shenzhen also is building an 
airport 
the hong kong airport which handled 153 million passengers last 
year and is fast reaching its capacity of 20 million is widely 
expected to be replaced by a larger facility in about a decade 
alexandre ho and leung kam chun two of the six elected members 
in the legislative assembly of macao believe an airport in macao 
may be nothing more than a flight of fancy 
personally i am not sure we will have enough passengers to 
maintain that airport said ho im doubtful whether we will 
have enough passengers to keep it running 
of the nearly 51 million tourists who arrived in macao during 
the first 11 months of 1988 fourfifths were hong kong residents 
ho maintained the portuguese would do better to focus on 
improving education medical services and social security 
many of the local chinese have long questioned portugals 
commitment to the colonys people fifteen years ago portugal 
offered to return the enclave to china but beijing declined without 
saying why

station 35000 american troops in okinawa one 
of japans smallest and most densely populated prefectures and you 
get some friction when shoulders start rubbing 
to farmers in chatan proximity means working small plots right 
up against the barbedwiretipped fences of the us kadena air base 
to elementary school children in futenma it means looking up 
from a playground and seeing cargo planes making their final 
approach to a us marine corps landing strip 
local residents and the us military are so close that kadena 
officials have received complaints from a used car dealer who said 
his newly waxed automobiles were dirtied by a breeze carrying water 
used to wash military jets 
and the noise 
its really terrible said ieko arakaki an employee at 
kadena city hall only 150 feet from the base perimeter all our 
windows are soundproof but they still rattle 
arakaki said microphones have been placed on the roof to record 
decibel levels and a 24hour hotline was set up in october so 
townspeople could voice their complaints 
us spokesmen agree that it can be tough but they dont see an 
alternative to bases and training on this famous world war ii 
battleground 
its like taking all the airstrips in texas and putting them in 
connecticut said paul berger civilian chief of kadenas 
community relations 
bordering on the bases fences are okinawa city population 
110000 chatan 19000 and kadena 14000 seventyfive percent of 
okinawa city lies within base perimeters 
kadena home of 9200 servicemen and the largest tactical fighter 
wing in the us air force is only one of 45 american facilities in 
okinawa japans southernmost prefecture composed of about 60 
islands 
nearly twothirds of the prefectures 12 million people are 
crowded into the southern third of okinawa island the main island 
naha okinawas capital is 1000 miles southwest of tokyo 
encroachment is about as bad as it can get said lt col 
robert winkelmann head of kadenas public affairs office 
winkelmann said the average number of takeoffs and landings at 
the base is 1570 a week but that traffic is directed over the sea 
or away from populated areas whenever possible 
we live here too and we know what the noise is like he 
said but wherever you have planes theres going to be noise 
by far the most conspicuous force is the 24000member marine 
corps which has eight major camps covering 15 percent of the 
roughly 70milelong island 
this is the largest concentration of marines outside the 
us said maj james vance public affairs officer he pointed 
out that roughly one in every 10 marines is stationed on okinawa 
smaller army and navy units are also based here 
vance said that because of okinawas size more than 90 percent 
of the training with live ammunition is conducted elsewhere often 
in south korea the philippines or australia 
we could put a howitzer in the sea on one side of the island 
and shoot it into the water on the other side he said adding 
that because of the lack of space tanks fire into tunnels dug into 
hills in the north 
liveammunition drills are regularly met with strong opposition 
and a spate of recent training accidents has brought national 
attention to okinawan military issues usually relegated to the 
local media 
in one of the accidents a live round fired during a marines 
exercise ricocheted off tires on a shooting range at camp hansen in 
central okinawa and ended up in the restroom of a highway service 
area vance said 
and the day after we announced the closing of that range some 
idiot goes and throws a tear gas cannister into a disco vance 
said two women were injured in that incident at the apple house in 
okinawa city in december 
people ask how something like that could happen he said i 
dont have an answer 
in early february an article in the okinawa times said the disco 
incident could trigger the kind of unrest that led to riots in 1970 
when more than 80 american vehicles were set afire 
however protests of us military training and even the american 
troops presence itself are rarely antiamerican in nature 
sometimes okinawans show more ill feeling toward the 6500 members 
of the japanese self defense forces stationed at 33 facilities and 
offices in okinawa 
okinawa a former monarchy with close ties to china korea and 
southeast asia was incorporated by japan in 1879 
many okinawans believe their islands were used by the japanese 
command during world war ii as a buffer to slow the advance of 
allied forces during the battle of okinawa in 1945 more than 
100000 civilians 110000 japanese soldiers and 12500 americans 
were killed 
the united states turned okinawa back the japanese in 1972 
the people of okinawa have endured control by outside elements 
throughout most of their history said vance we realize that 
and when incidents occur that is why we get such high visibility

joe ramos remembers days on the high 
seas chasing sperm whales the harpoon line whipping red hot over 
the gunwales the massive quarry thrashing in the water threatening 
the lives of its hunters 
ramos 85 also remembers his mother crying as he left his native 
cape verde islands off west africa following his father to new 
bedford from his droughtstricken homeland 
the country was in bad shape no water no rain no nothing 
thats when i decided to get out said ramos who was 18 when he 
boarded the wanderer the last squarerigged american sailing ship 
on april 28 1921 
in order to get out of the country i had to make a paper making 
me 21 i was the youngest boy on the ship he said when the whale 
boats came to cape verde they never explained anything they just 
said you come with us and were going to make you a man 
whaling ship captains were well aware of desperation like ramos 
and lured teenagers with promises of earnings as they made their 
way to the new world 
whaling had long since peaked as an industry by that time and 
no american in their right mind went whaling said joseph 
thomas who publishes a historical publication called spinner it 
was virtual slave labor 
shipowners of ramos day were just playing out their capital 
the ships had paid for themselves many times over said richard 
kugler of the new bedford whaling museum the oil market had been 
shrinking since the 1860s and the voyages out of new bedford were 
almost entirely sperm whale voyages which had an oil chemically 
different that still had uses and demands 
ramos remembers earning 14 for a years labor but we didnt 
care how much they paid we wanted to get out to come here 
he also remembers being slapped by the captain because he 
couldnt read a compass having buginfested beans to eat and 
seeing whale calves left to the sharks after their slowermoving 
mothers were harpooned 
i tell you working on a whaling ship there was nothing to 
enjoy there said ramos who last put to sea in 1922 two years 
before the last whaling squarerigger left new bedford 
ramos still has the massive hands thick fingers and leathered 
skin developed from rowing a whaling dory sometimes for a day at a 
time he never threw the harpoon he rowed and when a whale was 
harpooned he poured water on the rope to keep it from burning as it 
raced out of the boat 
in addition to seasickness and bad food whalers knew fear 
when you leave the mother ship in that little boat to get behind 
the whale you dont know whats going to happen ramos said a 
harpooned whale would pull a dory full of whalers through the water 
on what became known as the nantucket sleigh ride often the whalers 
would lose sight of their ship 
the hunt became particularly dangerous when a harpooned whale 
sounded plunging deep into the sea in an effort to escape its 
tormentors when the whale goes down he doesnt move he stays 
down sometimes 15 minutes when he comes up he comes just like an 
atomic bomb ramos said 
a dead whale floating on the surface would be marked with a flag 
for the mother ship to pick up while the men in the whale boat moved 
on 
ramos moved on too and by 1924 when the wanderer left new 
bedford on its last brief voyage he had been ashore two years 
picking cranberries for substantially more money than he earned on 
the high seas 
years later after working in cranberry bogs cotton mills and 
construction sites ramos returned to new bedford and visited the 
whaling museum where shipping records show his name listed on the 
crew of the wanderer and on a fivemonth voyage in 1922 aboard the 
schooner margarett 
at 85 suffering from bad eyesight and poor circulation ramos 
says he has forgotten much of his whaling days but one image sticks 
in his mind a whale after a sometimes protracted struggle would 
signal its demise by swimming in circles and when he was ready to 
die he would face the sun

foreign ministers of the european 
economic community on monday welcomed steps toward resolving a trade 
dispute with the united states over an eec ban on imports of beef 
treated with growthboosting hormones 
eec and us negotiators agreed over the weekend to form a task 
force to study the dispute over the next 75 days and try to find 
ways to end it 
frans andriessen the leading eec negotiator briefed the foreign 
ministers on his talks saturday with us trade representative carla 
hills and other officials 
the foreign ministers said in a statement the creation of a 
special panel was a step in the right direction to prevent a 
fullfledged trade war 
hoewver they stood by the eec ban on imports of hormonetreaqted 
meat from the united states and other countries 
that ban which took effect jan 1 affects imports of meat and 
byproducts from the united states worth 100 million 
the eec imposed the ban for health reasons the united states 
says hormonetreated meat poses no health threat to consumers and 
has responded by slapping duties on a range of eec imports worth 
100 million 
that in turn led the eec to threaten retaliation with 100 percent 
tariffs on 100 million in us imports of dried fruit and walnuts 
but monday the eec ministers refrained from putting that threat 
into effect 
instead they said they would continue to seek an amicable 
solution with washington yet they asked andriessen to pursue 
action within the gatt to get a condemnation of the unilateral 
measures by the united states to restrict eec imports 
the genevabased general agreement on tariffs and trade is the 
world trade organization 
the eec ministers who met here for their regular monthly 
consultations again called on washington to lift its import 
restrictions 
andriessens spokesman nico wegter quoted him as telling the 
ministers the eec and the united states must get out of this 
atmosphere of disputes and if there are trade difficulties the two 
sides should find a solution in a multilateral framework 
in washington on saturday andriessen told reporters the united 
states had indicated it would lower its retaliatory tariffs by an 
amount equal to the shipments of hormonefree beef it is able to 
make 
he said consideration would be given to doubling the quota of 
10000 tons set for shipments of highquality beef from the united 
states a higher quota would make it more profitable for american 
producers to raise hormonefree meat

the nations two largest beer companies looking 
for ways to carve out pieces of a stagnant us market have come up 
with fruitful strategies lately by importing ideas from japan 
the japanese have been big drinkers of bottleddraft beer and 
dry beer in recent years and now the two products are among the 
hottest selling items on american shelves 
the phenomenon however is not being driven simply by the 
japanese market analysts say instead it is the result of flat 
us domestic sales that have forced brewers to open their eyes to 
trends elsewhere 
if this had been during a 4 percent growth period they might 
have yawned at what was happening in japan said john collopy who 
follows the beer industry and is president of the milwaukee 
investment firm cleary gull reiland mcdevitt amp collopy inc 
twenty years ago the attitude was if god wanted us to have a 
new product grandfather would have invented it said robert 
weinberg a st louis analyst and former executive at anheuserbusch 
cos inc 
but now weinberg said im sure they know what type of beer is 
being brewed in afghanistan if a beer is taking off anywhere they 
are aware of it 
miller brewing co the countrys no 2 beer company based in 
milwaukee started the recent trend in 1986 with the introduction of 
miller genuine draft 
ralph kytan genuine draft brand manager said miller officials 
took notice a few years ago when packaged draft sales were climbing 
in japan 
were always looking all across the world at ideas he said 
we had senior executives in japan and they recognized what the 
concept of draft beer meant to the japanese consumer it also meant 
to the us consumer 
so we figured if it can work there it can work here 
miller obtained an agreement with japans sapporo brewing company 
to purchase the technology necessary for the nonpasteurized 
packaged draft beer 
since genuine drafts introduction the product has become one of 
the fastest growing brands in the country with shipments growing by 
about 50 percent last year genuine draft nearly cracked into the 
top 10 among us brands 
beer analysts are quick to note that american companies attempted 
to sell packaged draft beer in earlier years but did not give it the 
same push because the beer market was growing and there was less 
pressure 
similarly dry beers had been sold previously by regional 
breweries but officials at the larger companies say they were 
motivated more by the lack of growth in their domestic market and 
the dominance of dry beers in the japanese market 
i think its a recognition on the part of us companies that 
its a big world and you can take ideas from anywhere said john 
macdonough vice president of brand management for anheuserbusch 
if something seems to be working you pay attention more 
anheuserbusch the countrys no 1 brewer started national 
distribution of michelob dry late last year in addition g 
heileman brewing co the no 5 brewer based in la crosse also is 
selling dry beers on a regional basis 
both companies report customers have drained their products from 
the shelves although analysts say it is too soon to tell whether 
dry beer will take root in the american market or just be a fad 
but while miller officials say japanese and american drinkers 
share a notion of draft beer being a fresher more pure product the 
dry beers in the united states are much different from the japanese 
beers both in substance and in image 
japanese dry beers have a higher alcohol content macdonough 
said and they are marketed with a macho image 
but in pushing their dry beers anheuserbusch and heileman are 
focusing on their products lack of an aftertaste 
while he thinks it is a coincidence that japan has spurred the 
recent trends in the united states macdonough acknowledged 
anheuserbusch officials have paid more attention to the japanese 
market due to the companys overseas sales of budweiser 
we knew that dry beer was successful in japan because we were 
watching the media he said ten years ago we might not have 
noticed

the weekend arrival of new machinery may solve 
production problems at a minnesota chopsticks plant and allow the 
factory to open but the operation must still overcome a debt of 
more than 91 million the plants owner said monday 
were just sitting with our knees and fingers and toes and 
everything crossed said ian ward president of lakewood forest 
products ltd of vancouver british columbia this has gone from 
dream to nightmare and now its turning into a dream again 
when the plant opened in hibbing in july 1986 it was applauded 
for its boldness in taking on japan in the foreign trade war as it 
tried to massproduce chopsticks to the specifications of japanese 
buyers 
the japanese accepted some shipments but ward said machinery 
problems have kept the plant from reaching its goal of 7 million 
pairs of chopsticks a day production had reached between 700000 
and 1 million pairs a day before the plant was shut down for repairs 
dec 15 
ward said monday in a telephone interview from his vancouver 
office production was expected to resume as soon as workers install 
a new reeler at the plant the old reeler caused a vibration that 
spoiled the chopsticks veneer and was not large enough to handle a 
volume of 7 million pairs a day he said 
the reeler used to roll sheets of wood and load them into 
cutting machines was repaired and trucked to the hibbing plant 
sunday 
i think everybody has been full of stress and frustration but 
all we can do is push ahead ward said we have more commitment 
to this thing other people may have walked away but its been a 
wellconceived project that has had some difficulty 
he said the plants revenue should begin to exceed expenses by 
the middle of the year 
debts that must be repaid include 34 million in industrial 
revenue bonds about 500000 loaned by the city of hibbing 
250000 loaned by the state and 5 million loaned to the plant from 
its parent company lakewood forest products ltd ward said 
ward said japanese buyers have not been alienated by the plants 
production problems and will buy as many chopsticks as the plant 
produces he said lakewood will consider building other plants when 
its hibbing facility is operating efficiently

texas eastern corp fighting a hostile takeover 
attempt by coastal corp agreed to be acquired by panhandle eastern 
corp monday after panhandle outbid coastal with a 32 billion cash 
offer 
the agreement subject to approval by federal regulators was 
accepted by the texas eastern board just hours after the 53ashare 
offer was approved by panhandle easterns board of directors said 
panhandle eastern spokesman jim hart 
the combination of the two houstonbased natural gas companies 
would create a 27000mile system and result in the nations 
secondlargest pipeline company in terms of total miles hart said 
coastal corp spokesman will osterloh said his company would 
study the panhandle eastern offer before deciding whether to 
continue its 26 billion bid for texas eastern 
we are going to consider our options including possibly raising 
our offer dropping our bid or other courses of action open to us 
osterloh said 
under the agreement executed monday panhandle eastern plans to 
begin a cash tender offer tuesday for up to 80 percent of texas 
easterns 608 million outstanding shares at 53 per share or a 
total of 32 billion hart said 
those shares not purchased under the cash offer will be exchanged 
for panhandle eastern stock at the same 53ashare value according 
to the agreement 
texas easterns stock closed at 4350 a share in new york stock 
exchange composite trading friday the exchange was closed monday in 
observance of presidents day 
the panhandle eastern bid came five weeks after coastal offered 
26 billion or 42 a share that offer was rejected by texas 
eastern officials who believed the company could fetch a higher 
price 
we expect the combination of the two companies to result in 
significant operating synergies and appreciably enhanced operating 
income of the combined companies starting in 1990 said robert 
hunsucker chairman president and chief executive officer for 
panhandle eastern 
pahandle eastern has access to large midcontinent supplies of 
natural gas including the texas oklahoma kansas and the gulf of 
mexico and also operates a large liquefied natural gas facility in 
lake charles la 
the company also has connections to canadian gas through the 
northern border pipeline hart said while texas eastern has access 
to the rapidly growing new england natural gas market 
the combined systems will provide access to almost all the 
major gas processing markets in the nation said texas eastern 
spokesman fred wichlep 
dennis r hendrix president and chief executive officer at texas 
eastern described the agreement as the result of a thorough 
orderly process that has yielded for texas eastern stockholders the 
best value among the proposals developed 
texas eastern officials said monday they had talked to several 
interested companies since coastals surprise takeover bid was 
announced jan 16 but would not disclose the number or the 
seriousness of other inquiries 
however hendrix said the panhandle eastern bid which included 
provisions for a share exchange was by far the superior offer 
the purchase price is approximately 650 million higher than 
the coastal corps tender offer which our directors determined as 
inadequate and advised our stockholders to reject he said 
coastal and texas eastern have been in and out of court since the 
start of the takeover fight as coastal sought prevent texas eastern 
directors from deploying antitakeover measures 
on monday us district judge lynn hughes in houston dissolved 
an injunction designed to prevent texas eastern from filing parallel 
lawsuits in other courts without his permission 
hughes said coastal misrepresented facts when it said at the time 
of a preliminary hearing on its requested injunction that it was not 
involved in litigation elsewhere 
coastal issued a brief statement monday which said the 
dissolution of the injunction should not have any impact on 
coastals court case because the 5th circuit court of appeals had 
stayed the injunction back on jan 29 1989 
wichlep of texas eastern said hughes action means we are 
free to take any legal matters that may arise subsequently to the 
delaware court or any other court

at a low price executives have said 
kelly 66 heads dp kelly amp associates a chicago firm he 
formed last year to seek in partnership with salomon acquisitions

one of the most cynical little intrusions into 
the quality of life today is the telephone solicitation at 
dinnertime from a bank promoting a credit card or a marketing firm 
conducting a survey 
most people would probably rank it as one of those nagging little 
mosquito bites of life that must be endured too small a matter to 
make an issue of but certainly an irritant that their lives could 
do without 
it is when the mosquitoes swarm that the minor peeves become 
unendurable and no less an authority on the subject than the 
quality review has given recognition to the disturbing phenomenon 
the review published by the american quality foundation and the 
american society for quality control usually concerns itself with 
momentous issues of product quality especially as they relate to 
american competitiveness 
in the past for example it has declaimed on such matters as 
detroits manufacturing problems japans production efficiencies 
and engineering and statistical strategies for maintaining high 
quality in goods production 
its descent into the more mundane world of pet peeves is provoked 
by the feeling that the mosquitoes are everywhere and that all 
those little bites are leaving a welt on the quality of life equal 
to that of shoddy products 
judging from its list the irritants are all the more irritating 
because as the country immerses itself deeper into the service 
economy as opposed to an economy of goods production it may be 
getting less service than ever before 
first on its list is the unreturned telephone call making it 
especially frustrating is that the original call probably was 
received by a machine which in its recorded voice assured the 
caller that a response would be forthcoming 
it may lead to telephone tag with each party making successive 
fruitless attempts to return a call the review editors comment that 
this timewasting endeavor is equivalent to rework in the 
manufacturing arena 
dinnertime sales or solicitation calls earned second place on the 
list and provoked the suggestion that the way to deal with them is 
to screen your calls through an answering machine which however 
may be your friends pet peeve 
hotel telephone operators who leave you holding the phone so long 
that you have to redial longdistance in order to leave a 
message make the list 
indefinitely delayed notices at airports earn a place along 
with the comment if the airline cant bring itself to be up front 
with the information that this flight may never leave the ground 
maybe they could post the odds 
travelers who preempt overhead baggage compartments sales 
clerks who turn their backs on customers to serve telephone 
customers instead and servicemen or delivery men who keep you 
waiting all day are high on the reviews list 
one of the more serious of its pet peeves one that seemingly 
could rank with some of the oldfashioned complaints that quality 
control people used to be concerned with is the service contract 
even customers who purchase these contracts think they are a bad 
idea it says it asks why should anyone need a fiveyear service 
contract on a water heater that is guaranteed for 10 years 
all pet peeve lists are likely to differ especially if an 
attempt is made to limit them to a specific number 
the review for example feels that impenetrable packaging 
ranging from cracker wrappings to appliance containers and 
including envelopes that require tools to open belong on many 
lists if not theirs 
but it suggests that the diversity of lists merely proves the 
point that there are so many of these little irritants swarming 
through our service society that they are serving to create a major 
problem
