to check out a mailorder business 
kathleen calligan teddys owner and the president of the 
huntsville better business bureau said she spotted an ad in a 
freecirculation newspaper for united christian church and 
ministerial association in cleveland tenn 
ms calligan filled out an application for her cat mailed in 
20 cash and waited about a month teddy received his preachers 
license last week by return mail 
ms calligan stressed that nothing illegal was found with the 
way united ordains people or pets but she added that she sent in 
the bogus application to point out the nature of the business 
i dont want to say this is good or this is bad but they just 
ordained a cat this could be charles manson ms calligan said 
the founder and president of the united christian church amp 
ministerial association rejected her criticism saying ms calligan 
lied and fraudulently obtained the license 
i cant check all these licenses this is a master liar the 
rev h richard hall said of ms calligans application

received a few calls about halls organization since the beginning

myers said such licenses granted through the mail give the false 
impression that the holder has been through a postsecondary school 
education 
hall said his organization checks out most applications but 
this one slipped through 
while ms calligan did not state that the applicant was a cat 
she did provide enough unusual information to raise questions she 
said 
on the application ms calligan wrote that the applicants 
birthdate was april 2 1989 and that the cats calling to the 
ministry was to make people happy and not hunt birds 
she listed two huntsville preachers as references to be 
contacted both had been briefed on the application and were told 
to tell united officials that the applicant was a cat neither was 
contacted ms calligan said

many of us have waited and waited 
for the card or letter that never arrives but dont give up it 
just may someday 
the summer of 1958 when mary garrison and her husband moved to 
utah they took a trip to yellowstone national park with marys 
sister leah kerby at the lodge at old faithful mary garrison 
sent a postcard to her parents in columbus miss 
a few weeks ago kerby who still lives in mississippi 
discovered the card when she stopped by the post office to pick up 
the mail one postmark was dated june 2 1989 in columbus the 
other yellowstone park wyo jul 14 830 am 1958 
she called her sister in south ogden 
leah says i just came from the post office and received a 
postcard from you said garrison i said where in the world 
i didnt send you a postcard she said yes you did in 1958 
jim sherman postmaster of yellowstone post office at mammoth 
hot springs wyo said he doubts the card had spent all those 
years lost in yellowstone because all the postal buildings have 
been torn down and replaced with new structures since 1958 
perhaps he said it stuck to another piece of mail and went to 
another address 
that happens occasionally sherman said 
columbus postmaster roy smith said he has no earthly idea 
where the postcard could have been the only other similar case 
hes heard of is a letter that wound up hidden under a radiator for 
several years it wasnt discovered until the post office was moved 
to another location

after the crackdown on student protests in tiananmen square 
appeared on a television news show thursday and said he was no 
longer afraid of the chinese government 
i can no longer be afraid wuer kaixi said on the abc news 
program nightline late thursday ive already said what i 
have to do is to carry forward the cause of those who died 
i must do what they cannot have done i have no time to 
fear he said 
wuer and yan jiaqi prodemocracy fugitives from china arrived 
in chicago on wednesday for the first chinese students congress in 
the united states but failed to appear as scheduled at two news 
conferences 
wuer speaking from a television studio in chicago said 
conditions in china have grown more dangerous in recent weeks as 
the government continues its crackdown on students who led the 
prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing and other chinese cities 
he said it may not be possible for all student leaders to escape 
the country as he did 
im not sure anyone else will be able to come out he said 
but those who manage to come out should carry forward the tasks 
that they wish to carry out and those who died wished to carry 
out 
earlier thursday organizers of the student congress said wuer 
and yan were in danger 
they are in physical danger theyre really hiding minxin 
pei a harvard political science student and spokesman for the 
fledgling congress said at a news conference 
the visitors escaped from china after the military crushed 
student protests in beijings tiananmen square on june 4 they 
later surfaced in paris where they have been trying to rally 
worldwide support for the democracy movement in their homeland 
the pair were scheduled to participate in fridays formal 
opening of the threeday meeting of chinese students at american 
schools pei said the fbi is protecting the two leaders and he did 
not know their whereabouts 
wuer 21 was an organizer of the student demonstrations and 
yan 47 is the former director of the political science institute 
of the chinese academy of social sciences 
they are honored guests we want them to arrive safely and 
leave safely pei said 
pei said chinese officials have been harassing chinese student 
activists at us universities by making death threats during 
anonymous telephone calls he said officials from the chinese 
consulate in new york even visited his apartment called him a 
traitor and a fool for his prodemocracy activities and threatened 
big trouble if he persisted 
the congress of chinese students in the united states held at 
the chicago campus of the university of illinois is expected to 
draw 500 chinese students attending 154 us colleges and 
universities to discuss the democracy movement in china pei said 
our fellow brothers and sisters died in china and we should 
at least speak up for them said zhang xin a 33yearold student 
at the university of chicago who helped organize the congress it 
is our fundamental duty 
the congress will try to set up a radio station south of china 
said zhongdang pan a 31yearold journalism graduate student at 
the university of wisconsin 
transmission will be very powerful and we will put this 
transmission station very close to the border pan said 
pan said he also hopes to get a chinese language newspaper 
published in america and send copies to china 
the congress plans to mail and fax news to chinese offices 
hoping some of it will leak to the public the news will be 
addressed to businesses rather than to individuals to protect the 
people who receive the messages

this povertystricken rural town has 
received pledges of toilets sinks and bathtubs from florida to 
alaska for residents who only a few days ago had to haul water from 
a muddy creek 
weve come a long way in a short time but weve still got a 
long way to go said janie cole who with her husband have led a 
decadeold fight to bring the community of about 40 homes into the 
20th century its a warm feeling to know people still care about 
each other 
running water came only a week ago to the town of weathered 
shacks and mobile homes sprinkled along a twisting gravel road in 
southwest mississippi 
until then most residents hauled water from a creek or 
collected rainwater from rooftops 
federal money was used to pipe water into the community and 
appeals by cole and others resulted in a donations to pipe the 
water from the main line along the road to front porches of each 
home 
but there progress has stopped 
there are about 20 homes that have no inside plumbing so they 
are still getting their water for cooking and bathing from the 
outside tap cole said 
many of these people are old and they have no money to take 
care of the problem themselves said cole whose family has a 
private well without help there is little they can do 
news coverage focused on the communitys plight resulted in at 
least 25 calls from groups and individuals offering donations of 
fixtures and money cole said 
a man in florida has said he may provide water heaters a 
woman with an advertising agency in kentucky pledged commodes and 
a man in ohio has said he can help us with fixtures and possibly to 
install sewer lines she said 
if the pledged fixtures show up the major need would be 
plumbing work for the homes obtaining fittings to install fixtures 
and a sewage system 
perhaps the most impressive offer cole said came from 
officials with the alaska state housing authority 
we have 150 substandard lowincome housing units we are 
demolishing and replacing them with newer units and as a result we 
will have fixtures and items we will be surplusing said ray 
price the authoritys executive director in anchorage rather 
than put these items in the shelf or auction them off we felt it 
would be best to send them down to those who need them 
as you know our state has been through some tough times the 
last few years and we have rural communities here we are not 
oblivious to what these guys are going through 
mike wadell the authoritys project manager said officials 
were negotiating with federal express to transport tubs and other 
fixtures to memphis tenn and with a truck line to haul them to 
blue hill 
you really dont think people care that much any more but now 
you see that they just needed to be made aware of your problems 
said mary moore who is raising her three sons in a mobile home in 
blue hill 
moore said water had been piped inside her trailer and you 
cannot believe how thrilled we are but we are the lucky ones 
john w engerd who owns a furniture plant and store in berlin 
ohio called offering his help with plumbing and fixtures but said 
he may end up financing septic tanks and field lines 
there are always people heading to south america or somewhere 
else to help out engerd said when i read about their 
problems i thought it would do more good to help someone right 
here at home

outgoing us customs service commissioner 
william von raab harshly criticized the federal government saying 
the united states is not serious about fighting illegal drugs 
according to a television report 
in an interview thursday with abcnews von raab who was not 
reappointed and forced to resign his position of eight years said 
the state department during the reagan administration ignored drug 
production in other countries 
i think that certainly is the case with secretary george 
schultz who never really had anything to do with the drug issue it 
was totally foreign to him he said in the abc interview 
he said the united states has failed to apply political and 
economic pressure against drugproducing countries which allow 
traffickers to roam freely 
they feel no pressure whatsoever von raab said they are 
happily living out their lives as feudal barons in the hills of 
colombia peru and bolivia and no ones touching them including 
the united states theres so much cocaine out there that we cant 
control it 
after a us drug agent was killed in 1985 by drug dealers in 
mexico von raab sealed the border to pressure the mexican 
government into finding the killers 
president reagan and schultz were furious with his actions von 
raab said 
the administration went absolutely ballistic he said 
george schultz secretary of state accused me of being 
troglodyte i often felt that it was sort of the mexican government 
and the us government against me in the war on drugs 
he told abcnews that president bush and william bennett head 
of the presidents antidrug program are committed toward stemming 
the flow of illegal drugs into the country but he warned that not 
much is being done while bennett prepares his program 
he said that secretary of state james baker however does not 
seem to care about fighting illegal drugs 
theres a sort of cowardly streak i think in our state 
department it really is scandalous he said in the interview 
he also criticized his boss treasury secretary nicholas brady 
saying that brady is preoccupied with other issues instead of 
dealing with the drug problem 
its just out of control von raab said and in that sense 
our national policy has been a total and abysmal failure 
as long as our war is being fought with phrases words empty 
phrases empty words were not going to win he said weve 
got to turn the war from a war of words to a war of action 
state department spokesman adam shub said he had seen the 
program thursday night and heard von raabs comments on the reagan 
and bush administrations but could not comment 
shub said melvin levitzsky assistant secretary for narcotics 
has been on capitol hill two days and is expected to return friday 
in briefing congress on the administrations antidrug efforts

early tests of a new aids drug are so 
promising that federal scientists are expressing hope it may become 
a powerful new weapon against the epidemic that now numbers 100000 
cases 
scientists say they hope to start an expanded second phase of 
tests this fall and perhaps have the drug available for wide use 
next year 
phase i trials described in a report published today in the 
journal science showed that the drug called ddi controlled the 
growth of the aids virus and enabled patients to gain weight feel 
better and develop some resistance to infection 
this is not a cure for aids said dr robert yarchoan a 
national cancer institute researcher who helped direct the phase i 
trials but it appears to control the disease 
the number of aids cases reached the 100000 mark in recent 
weeks the centers for disease control said and 58014 aids 
patients had died as of june 30 no one is known to have recovered 
from the disease 
ddi laboratory shorthand for 23dideoxyinosine combats aids 
by blocking reproduction of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv 
which causes the disease this action is similar to azt or 
zidovudine the only drug now approved to directly treat aids or 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
like azt it ddi appears to reduce the replication of the 
virus and controls the disease yarchoan said in an interview 
it can keep the virus from replicating but it cant rid the body 
of the virus 
yarchoan said nci researchers hope to receive food and drug 
administration approval by september to start phase ii clinical 
trials involving some 1000 patients and 20 centers around the 
country 
he said these trials could last six months to a year and if 
they go well could lead to fda approval for wide use of ddi 
the journal science said that after the new clinical trials are 
underway ddi manufacturer bristolmyers hopes to distribute the 
drug without charge to patients who are in critical need no 
agreement for this distribution has been reached with the fda 
however the magazine said 
yarchoan said ddis action of blocking reproduction of the aids 
virus enables patients to recover some ability to fight infection 
this could prolong life since most aids patients die because immune 
systems weakened by the hiv virus cannot combat infection 
ddi said yarchoan has important advantages over azt it is 
less toxic better tolerated by patients and needs to be taken 
only two or three times a day azt must be taken six times daily 
without fail which requires patients to awaken during the night 
yarchoan said the clinical trials of ddi started 47 weeks ago 
for 26 patients five patients who earlier were taking a closely 
related compound called dda were added later 
we started at very low doses and as the patients tolerated 
each dose we worked our way up yarchoan said after the first 
four doses we found hints of activity but nothing that was too 
substantial 
but in our fifth dose we found very consistent improvement in 
immunologic function and at the same time evidence that the amount 
of virus in the people was going down he added 
meanwhile a coalition of activists on thursday said government 
inaction regarding aids threatens to isolate people with the 
disease and overburden the nations healthcare system 
the greatest threat we face may not be the virus itself but 
the complacency we see around us said jean mcguire executive 
director of the aids action council and head of the national 
organization responding to aids 
the groups called for federal antidiscrimination protections 
for people with aids more aggressive healthcare planning and more 
money for research and early intervention efforts with 
lifeprolonging therapies 
the federal government is spending about 13 billion this year 
on aids research prevention and education president bush proposed 
to spend 16 billion in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 but 
the groups said more is needed 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science coauthors of the paper were yarchoan

milan williams a founding member of the 
commodores said he has been fired from the rhythm and blues band 
for refusing to perform with the group in south africa 
williams said at a news conference wednesday that he was 
dismissed after 20 years with the commodores following a vote by 
the other band members earlier this month 
williams refused to accompany the band to south africa and made 
his decision public after a firestorm of criticism the band 
reluctantly agreed to cancel its trip 
my moral position as a black person and as a former member of 
the commodores was to protect my integrity and the integrity of an 
organization that existed for 20 years as a role model for the 
black community he said 
the other three members of the band walter orange william 
king and jd nicholas said in a recent letter to williams that 
they could be ostracized and financially ruined from the 
adverse publicity williams generated 
orange has said the group intended to use its visit to a black 
homeland in south africa to call for an end to that countrys 
policy of racial separation

this pack of cards doesnt come with a stick of 
gum and the vietnam emblazoned in red across its wrapper is a 
clear sign it wont hold dwight gooden or jose canseco 
inside are vietnam fact cards part of a 66card set 
developed by canadian collector dino frisella making it possible 
to swap two khe sanhs for a ho chi minh trail or flip richard nixon 
and lbj cards 
the time to make a decision on whether the war was right or 
wrong is long past we thought if we just stuck with the facts 
major incidents major players it would stir up conversation 
said frisella whose dart flipcards inc produced the set 
its struck a real nerve with collectors 
frisella didnt produce the cards as a joke or a novelty 
instead he said from his quebec home he hoped they would be used 
as an educational tool to teach youngsters about vietnam 
we know its impossible to tell the story of vietnam on the 
back of 66 cards but the only way youll start to know about it is 
if you can read about it said frisella 
the cards were targeted for children 8 to 14 although many have 
since been scooped up by collectors he said 
the cards are 2by4 inches they come a halfdozen to a pack 
wrapped like baseball cards but without the gum the complete set 
costs 850 frisella and partner stewart sergeant who developed 
the idea about 2 years ago printed more than 45000 sets 
the front of most cards feature color depictions of different 
vietnam events the battle of xuan loc or the ho chi minh trail or 
they depict key figures of the era nixon and henry kissinger share 
a card presidents lyndon johnson and john f kennedy each have 
their own 
they do have one thing in common with baseball cards the back 
is filled with information not rbis and home runs but details 
about whatevers on the front the cards begin in 1945 and run 
through 1975 
we had about 400 source books and hundreds of hours of tape we 
went through pulling out facts and figures said frisella 
one of his greatest fears was angering vietnam vets who might 
see the cards as trivializing the war but compared to some other 
products vietnam trading cards are the epitome of good taste 
weve had all kinds of people out there selling the vietnam 
war in one shape or another comic books you name it one guy was 
selling vietnam war tombstones with your service time right on the 
stone said barry kasinitz spokesman for the washingtonbased 
vietnam veterans of america although he hadnt seen the cards 
the sets have won acceptance in certain sections of americas 
heartland 
military museums in johnson city ill and massillon ohio 
feature promotional displays for the cards at the latter the 
response has been entirely positive 
basically we get all militaryoriented people we thought at 
first some people would be upset but that hasnt happened said 
barbara tate director of the ohio society of military information 
people are really interested young kids and a lot of vietnam 
vets too 
some feedback has been negative an unidentified veteran was 
quoted in baseball cards magazine as saying the vietnam war didnt 
belong on bubblegum cards 
overall frisella couldnt be happier with the ways things have 
gone 
some distributors were a little leery of anything with the 
topic of vietnam afraid of retribution he said but all the 
letters weve received and theres been a ton of em are 
favorable

a television station that packed 
nearly an hour of commercials around a 91second boxing match has 
been fined 11600 for airing too many advertisements a 
broadcasters group said today 
the philippine broadcasters association levied the fine against 
station abscbn after a public outcry over the large number of 
commercials during the june 1988 bout between heavyweight boxers 
mike tyson and michael spinks 
although tyson took only 91 seconds to defeat spinks the 
station stretched the program to more than one hour with 
commercials 
vic de vera association executive director said the industry 
watchdog agency first levied a 48000 fine last year but reduced 
it to 11600 this month after the station appealed 
the station said the high cost of televising the las vegas match 
and the unpredictability of its duration forced them to air 
lengthy commercials abscbn added that it should also have been 
given just a reprimand because it was the stations first violation 
of the broadcast associations code

now that an immigration appeals panel 
has ruled that leftist writer margaret randall is an american 
citizen who cannot be deported the first thing she wants to do is 
fly to paris 
ironically she will now finally be able to leave the country 
and visit her grandchildren said david cole randalls attorney 
the us board of immigration appeals ruled thursday that 
randall became a mexican citizen in 1967 under economic duress and 
the immigration and naturalization service should not have 
considered her politics in seeking to deport her 
the board which operates independently of the ins under the 
us justice department determined that randall never freely 
renounced us citizenship when she left in the 1960s for mexico 
where she married a mexican man 
im absolutely thrilled of course the 52yearold college 
professor said to tell you the truth im a little numb 
attorneys for randall an outspoken critic of us policy who 
lived 14 years in cuba and nicaragua said the ins was trying to 
punish her for her procommunist views 
cole said the ruling should say to the ins be a little more 
careful in instituting deportation proceedings against citizens 
justice department attorneys are reviewing the decision 
spokesman dan eramian said attorney general dick thornburgh will 
have the final word on the case ins cannot appeal it to another 
court 
randall a poet author and photographer has written 45 books 
in english and spanish including 17 books of poetry she has 
taught at the university of new mexico trinity college in 
hartford conn and the macalester college in st paul minn 
since returning to the us in 1983 on a visitors visa 
the ins claimed that randall gave up her us citizenship as a 
political protest and wanted mexican citizenship in order to get a 
passport to cuba it also claimed that as the wife of a mexican 
citizen she could have found work 
randall claimed her husband from whom she separated in 1967 
ceased providing for their three children one of whom was ill she 
also said she was led to believe that work laws in mexico forced 
her to be a citizen before she would find a job 
randall was ordered deported in 1985 after her request for 
permanent resident status as an alien was denied based on what the 
ins said were communist and antiamerican beliefs espoused in her 
books 
norman mailer kurt vonnegut alice walker arthur miller and 
william styron were among writers who filed suit in us district 
court in washington dc after the ins denied her application 
cole said the 32 decision by the appeals panel was unexpected 
i think the decision affirms that us citizenship is a 
constitutional right and that one cannot lose ones citizenship 
because the government doesnt like what you say said cole of 
the new yorkbased center for constitutional rights its sort of 
a nice rebuke to the ins 
now we just go to the passport office to pick up her 
passport cole said shes a us citizen 
randall who has been living near her parents in albuquerque 
said she wants to fly to paris for the birth next month of her 
third grandchild 
im hoping i can be there when hes born which was not 
possible the first two times around she said

researchers have isolated fetal cells 
from pregnant womens bloodstreams suggesting it should be 
possible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by taking 
a blood sample from the mother 
if the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mothers 
bloodstreams is confirmed it should be possible to do the same 
kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal 
tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis that procedure 
involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus 
making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate the 
small risk associated with amniocentesis the researchers said 
the method however cannot be used to screen for downs 
syndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must be 
examined under a microscope because the fetal cells isolated from 
the mothers bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis 
the method could be useful for diagnosing such disorders as 
sickle cell anemia cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria in which 
the precise genetic defect is known the studys authors said 
in those cases the genetic defect can be detected chemically 
and examination of chromosomes under a microscope is unnecessary 
researchers have known that fetal cells could occasionally break 
off of the placenta and get into a pregnant womans bloodstream 
but no one had demonstrated that this occurred often enough so that 
fetal cells could be routinely found in the mothers blood 
the study headed by dr diana bianchi of boston childrens 
hospital shows that the fetal cells can be regularly isolated from 
mothers blood but not 100 percent of the time 
that accuracy must be improved and it may be some years before 
the method is reliable enough for routine use bianchi said in a 
telephone interview 
furthermore researchers need better ways to be certain that the 
cells they isolate are from the fetus she said thursday 
bianchis results will be discussed saturday at a meeting of 
geneticists at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor she presented 
preliminary findings at a meeting in washington of the society for 
pediatric research in may and has submitted more detailed findings 
for publication in a medical journal 
dr laird jackson of thomas jefferson medical college in 
philadelphia said that bianchis research provides the most 
convincing evidence yet that a blood sample from the mother can be 
used to diagnose fetal disorders he noted however that the 
method is not yet perfected 
bianchi and her colleagues who sampled the blood of four 
pregnant women said looking for the fetal cells was far worse than 
looking for a needle in a haystack the mothers blood contained 
roughly one fetal cell for every billion mothers cells 
youre really at the limits of technology bianchi said 
fetal cells were extracted by adding an antibody to the blood 
sample that would stick to fetal red blood cells but not to adult 
red blood cells the cells with antibodies attached to them could 
then be separated with a sophisticated electronic sorting machine 
but the researchers then had to prove that the cells they had 
isolated were indeed fetal cells three of the mothers tested were 
carrying male fetuses males have y chromosomes and females dont 
so the researchers tried to show that the cells theyd isolated had 
y chromosomes that would mean that the cells came from the male 
fetus not the mother 
the researchers were able to prove the existence of the y 
chromosome in two of the three cases in which mothers carried male 
fetuses bianchi said subsequent tests on more mothers have shown 
that the method is reasonably accurate but not perfect 
the fetal cells that they isolated are called nucleated red 
blood cells unlike adult red blood cells these cells have a 
nucleus that carries a complete set of the fetuss genes it is 
these genes that can be analyzed for the presence of disorders

a report on black americans attacks the belief 
that poor people are locked into a selfperpetuating culture of 
poverty that sets them apart from society and saps them of the 
will to work or sacrifice 
many of the nations poor are hardworking people who save 
when they can endure numerous deprivations worry about the future 
and urge their children to do well in school and on the job 
experts said after a fouryear study 
the conclusion was a central finding in a common destiny 
blacks and american society issued thursday by a panel of the 
national research council an arm of the national academy of 
sciences and engineering 
yale economist gerald jaynes directed the study participated in 
by nearly 100 academic experts foundations paid most of the 27 
million cost 
the report was described as the most comprehensive study ever 
undertaken of the condition of blacks in america its chief finding 
was that while discrimination still holds blacks back economic 
stagnation that took hold in the mid1970s is the chief factor in a 
widening gap between american whites and blacks 
whites have changed their attitudes but not their behavior and 
thats another cause of the gulf between equal opportunity for 
blacks and its actual attainment jaynes said 
whites desire equal treatment for blacks in society but many 
are reluctant to put this desire into practice in their personal 
life he told a news conference 
this is a great improvement over 45 years ago when majorities 
of whites openly supported segregation or discriminatory treatment 
of blacks but the divergence between principle and practice 
frequently means that social institutions do not produce the equal 
opportunity that americans desire he said 
as for the culture of poverty the report disputed the 
assumption that poverty is perpetuated from generation to 
generation as children learn selfindulgence have low aspirations 
in school and lose any ability to sacrifice for the future 
qualities that lock them in poverty 
most poor families move in and out of poverty several times over 
a lifetime which would not happen if such a condition existed the 
report said the chronically poor are only a minority of all poor 
people 
moreover many poor people do not exhibit the stereotypic set 
of characteristics supposedly constituting the culture of poverty 
such as apathy and an unwillingness to defer gratification 
the report also cited studies which found no difference in the 
values and goals of people who are poor and those who arent 
the insecure and deprived conditions of life of poor families 
when long continued do result in cultural differences from 
welltodo and secure families the report said but those 
difference vanish when the poor are given economic opportunity and 
the incentives to live better

a regional dispute that pits northwest timber 
interests against defenders of the spotted owl is spiraling into a 
national struggle over whether congress should impose extraordinary 
restrictions on the legal rights of environmentalists 
after winning a string of preliminary court victories blocking 
logging in vast sections of the ancient forests where the owls 
nest environmentalists say a temporary cease fire congress may 
impose would set a precedent that could be used to block judicial 
review of a wide range of federal decisions and actions 
environmentalists have enlisted the aid of organizations ranging 
from the american civil liberties union to the center for auto 
safety and the mexican american legal defense and education fund to 
the union of concerned scientists 
prohibiting citizen challenges to government actions places 
agencies above the law and violates fundamental principles of 
democratic government the groups said in a letter to senators 
while the groups noted that recent limitations on judicial 
review set by congress have involved public land and resource 
issues the practice could be used to bar citizen challenges to 
any government agency 
the interior appropriations bill is headed for a housesenate 
conference committee to iron out differences in the two versions 
before final passage by both houses the house version does not 
include the timber amendment 
an amendment attached by northwest lawmakers to the 
senatepassed bill would bar federal courts from enjoining or 
overturning any timber sale planned in the federal forests of 
oregon and washington known to contain spotted owls the ban would 
be in effect for 14 months 
in addition the amendment requires that environmentalists agree 
by oct 1 to release more than half of the roughly 2 billion board 
feet of timber enjoined for immediate sale if they dont the 
amendment would allow the forest service and the bureau of land 
management to proceed with the sales regardless of the injunctions 
jay hair president of the national wildlife federation said 
the amendment would allow the forest service to break virtually 
every environmental law congress has ever set 
northwest lawmakers said that even though they were reluctant to 
limit judicial review it was necessary if they were to keep the 
timber industry afloat until a permanent fix can be imposed 
lawmakers say mills in washington and oregon already are closing 
because of a severe shortage of timber resulting from the 
injunctions 
no one was eager to do this said rep al swift dwash 
but we needed some certainty in the timber supply and that 
couldnt be achieved if the sales were tied up in the courts this 
is only a shortterm fix 
sen brock adams dwash said that lawmakers were under 
great pressure to act and the amendment was aimed not only at 
ensuring mills had enough logs to operate but also at the beginning 
to protect some of the most significant stands of oldgrowth timber 
we did what we had to do said adams adding that despite 
the judicial limitations lawsuits challenging forest service and 
blm management plans for spotted owl habitat would be allow to 
continue on their merits 
lawmakers also said the precedent for limiting judicial review 
previously had been set by congress though adams said it had 
always been used sparingly 
congress in the 1930s limited the ability of federal courts to 
issue injunctions in labor strikes and in authorizing the alaska 
oil pipeline in the early 1970s congress said the issuance of 
construction and operation permits would not be subject to judicial 
review 
more recently congress enacted a statute in 1980 that allowed 
the secretary of transportation to impound federal highway funds 
despite court injunctions prohibiting it in 1983 congress 
exempted the mx missile program from federal environmental laws in 
the midst of an ongoing court challenge 
sen mark hatfield rore has four times over two years 
attached amendments to appropriations bill that barred appeals of 
several planned timber sales 
when the timber amendment was offered in the senate 
appropriations earlier this week three democratic senators spoke 
against it wyche fowler of georgia dale bumpers of arkansas and 
harry reid of nevada 
this is unprecedented said fowler adding that congress 
needed to be careful in approving such legislation despite the 
timber crisis

the tickcarried rocky mountain spotted fever a 
potentially deadly disease increased nearly 4 percent last year 
with dramatic hikes reported in missouri arkansas and kentucky 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
615 cases of rocky mountain spotted fever occurred in the united 
states in 1988 up 39 percent from 592 cases in 1987 
the largest number of cases occurred in north carolina with 
108 followed by oklahoma with 97 and missouri with 57 
the missouri data indicate that the geographic focus of the 
disease may be shifting that states case total was up nearly 
threefold from just 19 cases in 1987 
the increase in missouri may reflect an extension of the area 
in which rmsf is endemic in the west south central states the 
cdc said 
large increases also occurred in arkansas from 12 to 32 cases 
and in kentucky from 13 to 30 
the disease causes symptoms including fever headache and rash 
at least 21 deaths were reported in 1988 
because no vaccine exists the best preventive measure is 
avoidance of tickinfested areas the cdc said in its report 
the cdc recommends that people who are in tickinfested areas 
wear protective clothes and use tick repellent 
tick bites were reported in 63 percent of the us cases the 
cdc said such reports are important because in cases where tick 
bites are not reported diagnosis may be delayed increasing 
the likelihood of serious or fatal complications

it is now six weeks since felix bloch was 
ordered to surrender his pass to the state department on the 
suspicion the veteran diplomat was engaged in espionage for the 
soviet union 
but the suspended bureaucrat still collecting his pay is free 
to travel to visit relatives in new yorks westchester county 
trailed by fbi agents themselves reportedly trailed by soviet 
agents he also is evidently free to leave the country 
it could be that the fbi and other investigators simply do not 
have the evidence to arrest the 54yearold bloch and are hoping 
the soviets will try to make contact with him 
to a reporter who knew him casually bloch is a most unlikely 
spy courtly and pleasant he was engaged in the european bureau in 
the driest of jobs 
bloch headed the office of regional politicaleconomic affairs 
which has nothing to do with the nato military alliance and 
conventional and nuclear weapons issues 
instead he was concerned with trade and development and with 
two western groups headquartered in paris the organization for 
economic development and the coordinating committee on strategic 
materials 
the first is devoted to joint development efforts both in the 
wealthy west and in the impoverished third world the second seeks 
to restrict the sale of securitysensitive material to the soviet 
union and the eastern bloc 
the job took bloch to paris where he was videotaped handing a 
briefcase contents not revealed to a soviet agent 
bloch was in the french capital in midmay to address west 
european economic officials on the european communitys effort to 
establish a single integrated market by 1993 he also went to 
madrid for the semiannual meeting of the european communitys 
political directors at the end of may he was in brussels for 
president bushs meeting with jacques delors of the european 
commission 
only last tuesday a month after he was put an administrative 
leave bloch and other state department officials attended a 
meeting here in washington of the atlantic council a private 
foreignpolicy group 
as alice in wonderland might have said it just gets curiouser 
and curiouser 
if bloch was under suspicion of spying for the soviets why was 
he allowed to roam around this country and western europe 
if he is a spy why hasnt he been swapped quietly for an 
american agent or some other prize in soviet hands 
after all as president bush observed on monday espionage 
goes on all the time 
bloch has hired two lawyers to help him contest the accusations 
which may stem from his work in vienna first as the economics 
officer and then as deputy chief of mission in the us embassy 
there 
senior state department officials have confirmed that as the no 
2 person in the embassy bloch was informed of central intelligence 
agency activities he saw everything especially when he worked 
for two political appointees helene von damm and ronald lauder 
who were unschooled in foreign policy 
he also had the job of trying to keep austria a neutral 
country from shipping sensitive materials to the east 
bloch who fled austria as a child as nazism spread across 
europe never lost his love for his native land 
but reports that he hampered us efforts to stiffen controls on 
strategic exchanges have not been substantiated and a former us 
ambassador cautioned against exaggerating blochs contacts with cia 
in all my time i heard from the cia only once the exenvoy 
said 
perhaps the fbi is engaged in a waiting game with bloch who 
apparently was first questioned by the fbi on june 22 the day he 
was suspended from the state department 
james nolan who worked for the fbi for 28 years and then headed 
the state departments office of foreign missions until his 
retirement last year said wednesday that its not uncommon at 
all for time to pass before an arrest even when a confession has 
been made 
confessions can be challenged in court sometimes successfully 
the delay provides time to gather evidence 
you have to go find a specific classified document he turned 
over and someone in the government who will testify in court that 
it is classified nolan said

smoking among american men has been dropping 
since the early 1950s but federal researchers say women kept 
taking up the habit into the next decade and are now paying the 
price with higher rates of lung cancer 
unless women start quitting in significant numbers the public 
health problem is going to get more significant no question about 
it said dr edward j sondik a national cancer institute 
specialist who helped prepare a federal health report on smoking 
and cancer 
the atlantabased centers for disease control reported thursday 
that lung cancer deaths increased 15 percent in the united states 
between 1979 and 1986 to a rate of about 50 deaths per 100000 
people more men than women die of lung cancer about 74 deaths 
per 100000 for males in 1986 compared to 27 per 100000 for women 
but the mortality rate from lung cancer among women is soaring 
compared to the rate for men between 1979 and 1986 the lung 
cancer death rate for women jumped 44 percent while the rate for 
men was up just 7 percent 
the cdc said male smoking has been on the decline since the 
early 1950s but smoking among women peaked at about 1965 the 
recent dropoff in smoking among women from 32 percent in 1965 to 
27 percent in 1987 studies isnt nearly as sharp as the drop in 
smoking by men from 50 percent to 32 percent 
the men are in a very significant downward trend while the 
women a lot of them were taking up smoking in the 1950s and 
60s sondik said 
statistically the cdc reported peaks in smoking seem to be 
followed by peaks in lung cancer deaths about 35 years later more 
than eight out of 10 lung cancer deaths are believed to be caused 
by smoking 
the burden of lung cancer and other smokingrelated chronic 
diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema will be substantially 
higher for many decades because of the long latency periods 
between exposure to tobacco and onset of these diseases the cdc 
said 
that the agency said means the death rate from lung cancer 
among women continues to climb and will do so until the turn of 
the century or possibly longer assuming the 35year lag between 
peak smoking and peak deaths 
the cdc noted that lung cancer already has passed breast cancer 
as the most common cause of cancer death among women 
while almost half of all americans who ever took up smoking have 
quit the cdc said more than 50 million people in the united 
states continue to smoke 
in 1986 the last year statistics are available 85050 men died 
of lung cancer in the united states compared to 40461 women the 
cdc said nearly twothirds of those deaths were people over 65 
the lung cancer death rates are about the same for white females 
and black females 274 per 100000 for white women and 264 for 
black women in 1986 the death rate among males however is higher 
for blacks 984 to 723 
the highest lung cancer death rate among the states in 1986 was 
in alaska with 148 such deaths for a rate of 705 per 100000 
people the lowest was in utah with 275 such deaths or a rate of 
243

the bush administration after weeks of 
absorbing unrelenting criticism on its clean air bill is taking 
the offensive by questioning the motives of its critics 
the steppedup defense surfaced thursday when a top 
environmental protection agency official william rosenberg 
accused democratic critics of making unfair and totally biased 
attacks on the bill and of falsely calling the proposal a sellout 
to automakers 
rosenberg handed out a comparison sheet that said a rival bill 
would be far costlier while achieving only marginally more 
pollution reduction 
the competing legislation was sponsored by rep henry a waxman 
dcalif the most vocal critic of the administration plan waxman 
a staunch supporter of environmental groups that have denounced the 
bush proposal held the first hearing on the administration measure 
monday 
rosenberg said the session was scheduled to politicize the 
issue 
while a number of house democrats as well as senate majority 
leader george j mitchell dmaine have attacked the 
administrations bill it was introduced in the house on thursday 
night with bipartisan support 90 republicans and 57 democrats 
several epa officials said the final straw that triggered 
rosenbergs heated comments was the waxmanchaired hearing of the 
house energy and commerce environment subcommittee 
for five hours epa administrator william reilly a career 
environmentalist and rosenberg the epas assistant administrator 
for air sat at the witness table while waxman and other democrats 
excoriated the bill 
waxman even produced an auto lobbyists scorecard to 
emphasize his contention that the legislation wont reduce auto 
emissions 
singled out was a provision to allow automakers to average 
pollution emissions by an engine category instead of forcing each 
vehicle to meet new antipollution requirements a red 
herring rosenberg said thursday 
committee democrats complained about the exclusion of controls 
on toxic chemicals emitted by cars trucks and small industries 
and about the consideration of economic factors in determining the 
health threat from toxic emissions they also contended that the 
bill failed to protect national parks 
the reaction when we walked out was the stuff being said was 
unfair much of it was inaccurate and we werent given the chance 
to get a word in edgewise said epa spokesman david cohen 
the agencys chief lobbyist patrick quinn said reilly had 
not been in a hearing with that level of antagonism reillys 
lifes work has been as an environmental professional and to sit 
there and have such distortions and verbal badgering doesnt 
sit well in a lot of peoples stomachs 
cohen said no formal strategy for aggressiveness was devised 
after the meeting but other epa officials said a number of 
staffers decided it was time to respond better to the criticism 
waxman said the hearing was fair and highlighted the 
differences that we have for controlling emissions from cars and 
trucks he praised reilly for doing as good a job as he could 
putting a good face on a bill that could actually increase 
emissions for motor vehicles 
rosenberg chose to make his comments at a news conference that 
had been scheduled to release epa figures on ozone and carbon 
monoxide pollution he immediately ripped into the critics 
asked by a reporter why should we trust you rosenberg 
replied the issue is why you should trust the critics

senators are threatening action that could 
lead to jail for a disbarred lawyer who refuses to answer questions 
in the impeachment trial of federal judge alcee l hastings 
if you continue to refuse to testify i believe this committee 
will take steps that will force your incarceration sen joe 
lieberman dconn told william borders on thursday 
hastings 52 a us district court judge in miami was 
impeached by the house last august and is on trial in the senate 
conviction by the senate on charges of plotting to get a 
150000 payoff perjury and improper disclosure of wiretap 
information would mean the loss of his judicial post and 89500 
salary 
a federal court jury acquitted him in 1983 of criminal charges 
of conspiracy to obtain a bribe 
borders a law school classmate of hastings and once a 
political power in washington was imprisoned after being convicted 
on the charges in a separate trial he was arrested in october 1981 
as he drove out of a suburban virginia motel with a cashstuffed 
garment bag and an undercover fbi agent by his side 
flanked by two attorneys borders angrily described for the 
12member senate panel hearing evidence how he had lost my former 
livelihood as a result of the case and been accorded harassing 
and somewhat contemptible treatment by federal authorities 
he refused to answer questions saying that to do so would 
violate his right against selfincrimination under the fifth 
amendment to the constitution as well as his rights under five 
other amendments 
he asked to finally be left alone to pursue the speck of 
happiness that was left to me 
i respectfully refuse to answer any and all questions he 
said 
lawmakers threatened to cite borders for civil contempt because 
of his refusal jailing him would require action by the full senate 
and court approval senators warned there was no assurance that he 
would not face only a civil contempt citation but charges of 
criminal contempt 
senators said there was still time for him to extricate himself 
by testifying if necessary in a deposition witnessed by at least 
one senator while lawmakers are on their august recess 
at the hearings the senators have heard tapes of fbi undercover 
agent h paul rico posing as a racketeer who wanted to have his 
threeyear sentence and a similar term imposed by hastings on his 
brother changed to probation 
on the tapes borders is heard to say that he could get hastings 
to make such a change and even persuade the judge to return 
845000 that had been forfeited to the government 
hastings says borders a longtime friend was a rainmaker 
who was using his name to obtain payoffs hastings says he had 
nothing to do with the scheme

the senate continues its rush to finish major 
portions of its budget work as it nears the recess wire deciding 
to provide the first federal funds for building a giant atom 
smasher in texas 
on a voice vote thursday lawmakers approved an 184 billion 
bill for fiscal 1990 energy and water projects that contains 225 
million for the superconducting supercollider the 44 billion 
research facility planned for waxahachie texas 
final passage was delayed by a futile attempt that lasted 
hours by opponents of the medicare catastrophic care program to 
delay the surtax many of the nations senior citizens will have to 
pay to finance the initiative 
earlier in the day the senate approved a separate 443 billion 
agriculture bill that boosts spending on domestic food aid programs 
and pressures the government to tighten its requirements for food 
labels 
both houses of congress have approved three of the 13 
appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 needed annually to finance 
federal agencies but the two chambers still must agree to 
compromise versions of the three measures before sending them to 
president bush for his signature 
fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 but lawmakers are scheduled to begin 
their fourweek summer recess aug 5 
in its energy legislation the senate provided 135 million to 
begin construction of the 53milelong doughnutshaped 
supercollider and 90 million for research and development 
the underground facility would be the worlds largest particle 
accelerator capable of throwing two proton beams at each other at 
nearly the speed of light scientists say their research could help 
them learn about natures most basic building blocks 
the project expected to take five to seven years to complete 
would create an anticipated 3500 construction jobs and 2500 
permanent jobs it would be built 25 miles south of dallas 
the bill also contains 42 billion for water projects 96 
billion for nuclear weapons programs and 350 million to study a 
potential highlevel nuclear waste storage site in yucca mountain 
nev 
sen john mccain rariz was defeated 5840 when he offered an 
amendment that would have delayed the medicare surtax for a year 
but the issue will persist the house ways and means committee 
has already voted to cut the levy in half and white house budget 
director richard darman told reporters thursday that the 
administration was in the process of compromising on rolling 
back the program 
the agriculture legislation would expand federal spending for an 
assortment of domestic food assistance programs to 188 billion 
15 billion more than bush sought in the budget he sent congress 
in february and 2 billion above 1989 levels 
this includes 49 billion for child nutrition programs about 
the same as bushs request 21 billion for food aid to women 
infants and children 200 million above bushs figure and 154 
billion for food stamps 13 billion above the bush number 
a report approved with the bill also directs the food and drug 
administration to move forward with clarifying the meanings of 
natural lowfat lite and other terms food producers 
commonly place on their labels 
however the report did not address the controversy over red dye 
no 3 the food coloring that is considered a potential carcinogen 
in its measure the house ordered the government to refrain from 
banning the food coloring until longrange studies of its health 
effects are completed 
report language is not legally binding agencies must take such 
commands seriously however or risk antagonizing lawmakers who can 
retaliate against offending bureaucrats in future bills

the internal revenue service commissioner says 
hell look into allegations by an arkansas legislator that the irs 
blocked congressional and police efforts to investigate an alleged 
drugsforarms operation 
rep bill alexander dark said thursday that two house 
subcommittees the arkansas state police and the general accounting 
office have been investigating possible violations at the mena 
ark airport where cargo planes apparently left for central 
america with arms and returned with drugs 
this investigation led us to the irs about a year ago 
alexander said during house government operations subcommittee 
hearings on alleged corruption at the irs 
alexanders comments came during questioning of newly appointed 
irs commissioner fred goldberg former commissioner larry gibbs 
senior deputy commissioner michael murphy and other irs officials 
alexander said congress and the state police wanted access to 
william duncan then an agent for the irs criminal investigative 
division who was investigating a money laundering scheme connected 
to the overall narcotics trafficking probe 
but alexander said the irs would not cooperate citing privacy 
restrictions 
the effect of the failure of your cooperation has been to let 
the statute of limitations run out on drug traffickers alexander 
said to the irs officials 
goldberg said he would personally look into the matter 
i will make it crystal clear to all our employees that they 
will cooperate to the fullest extent of the law with you he said 
duncan was investigating the activities of the late barry seal 
a convicted drug smuggler turned government informant who operated 
out of the mena airport from 1984 until he was slain in february 
1986 at baton rouge la the arkansas gazette reported thursday 
alexander told the gazette that duncan was under orders from 
thenattorney general edwin meeses office in washington to 
withhold evidence in federal grand jury proceedings that examined 
activities at the mena airport 
alexander said it was only through duncans resignation from the 
irs that any information became available 
duncan who testified earlier thursday said he resigned after 
17 years with the irs because he was advised by an irs attorney to 
lie to congress about the investigation 
the subcommittee heard three days of testimony from 
investigators and present and former irs employees who described 
threats intimidation and retaliation against irs workers who 
reported wrongdoing by superiors 
committee chairman doug barnard dga in a sometimes heated 
exchange with murphy harshly criticized the agency thursday 
the irs world that you describe where wrongdoers are 
systematically punished and where whistle blowers are cherished is 
a world i dont recognize not from our investigation barnard 
said 
its the land of oz and you are the wizards he bellowed 
nearly rising from his chair 
barnard blew up at murphy when he said the irs had cooperated 
fully with the subcommittee and that misdeeds that were exposed 
were isolated instances 
barnard said the agency was not cooperative and suggested the 
law should be changed to allow other congressional committees with 
oversight over the agency access to records 
only ways and means senate finance and the joint committee on 
taxation now may see taxpayer files without the individual 
taxpayers permission

the house apparently will begin its august 
recess without voting on a democraticbacked statute designed to 
overcome the supreme court ruling that allows flag burning 
the house judiciary committee approved the flagprotection bill 
on thursday 286 with republican support but the gop turned 
around and made parliamentary objections that blocked speaker 
thomas s foleys plan to bring the bill to the full house next 
week 
foley dwash told reporters he would bring the bill to the 
floor in september 
but the lack of full house action before the aug 5 recess hurts 
the democrats strategy of making their argument to the public that 
congress should pursue a statute before any constitutional 
amendment 
the bill includes penalties of up to a year in prison plus an 
unspecified fine for physically desecrating a flag and it was 
drafted to address the high courts decision that existing statutes 
against flag burning were an attempt to squelch free speech 
it protects the flag and it protects the constitution said 
rep steny hoyer dmd chairman of the house democratic caucus 
republicans insist that only a constitutional amendment can 
overcome the supreme court ruling that flag burning was a protected 
form of free speech 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said gop refusal 
to try a statute before a constitutional amendment showed that the 
republicans were mostly interested in partisan advantage 
the people who pose as the most vigilant supporters of flag 
protection seem more interested in adding political graffiti to 
the constitution than in protecting the physical integrity of the 
american flag he said 
house minority leader bob michel rill told reporters that 
bushs chief of staff john sununu urged republican leaders at a 
white house meeting tuesday to push the flag amendment because its 
a wedge issue one that divides and injures the democratic 
party 
although to protect themselves politically theyre voting for 
the statute also 121 in the judiciary committee republicans 
ridicule the democrats for pursuing it 
this bill is essentially useless said rep carlos moorhead 
rcalif who voted for it in committee along with 12 of 13 voting 
republicans 
its obviously going to get a try and i may end up voting for 
it michel said but said it would be a meaningless vote 
democratic leaders thursday defended their position at a news 
conference toting along with them the flag that flew over the 
capitol on the day pearl harbor was attacked by the japanese the 
flag saw service in the european theater and then flew on the 
uss missouri when the japanese surrendered in 1945 
judiciary committee chairman jack brooks a decorated marine in 
world war ii said he would sponsor a constitutional amendment if 
the statute didnt work but said it would be foolish not to try a 
statute could be passed far quicker than an amendment which 
requires ratification of the states said brooks dtexas

the conviction of christer pettersson 
for the 1986 killing of prime minister olof palme is not likely to 
lift the aura of mystery that surrounds one of swedens most 
infamous crimes 
pettersson a 42yearold social misfit with a long record of 
crime drunkenness and drug abuse was sentenced thursday to life 
imprisonment 
but the palme file still has plenty of blank pages for advocates 
of conspiracy theories it promises to become swedens equivalent 
to the 1963 assassination of president john f kennedy 
palme a dynamic fourterm premier and swedens leading 
political figure for two decades was shot as he walked home with 
his wife lisbeth from a downtown movie theater on feb 28 1986 
the two professional judges on the jury voted to acquit 
pettersson for lack of evidence but they were overruled by the six 
lay jurors 
in a 46page verdict the jury pinned its judgement on mrs 
palmes identification of pettersson she said she saw him standing 
15 feet away just after her husband crumpled to the street 
the way she identified him at the trial is according to the 
court very convincing the judgement said 
it cited other witnesses who saw pettersson waiting for the 
palme couple and following them this testimony supported lisbeth 
palmes identification to such a degree that the court finds it 
without reasonable doubt that he fired the two shots 
the two dissenting judges noted that the murder weapon a 357 
magnum revolver was never found and no physical evidence surfaced 
to link pettersson to the shooting no one swore to seeing him fire 
a weapon 
the factor of uncertainty is so prominent that we cant vote 
to convict said judge michael af geijerstam 
its evident that the verdict hinged on the relative 
subjectivity of the jurors as opposed to the legal approach of 
the judges said anders stening a lawyer in a television debate 
the motive is the biggest unanswered question in the case why 
would pettersson kill palme 
the written judgement ignored the issue during the fiveweek 
trial the prosecution intimated that pettersson simply hated all 
authority pettersson who maintained his innocence claimed to be 
an admirer of palme 
why did no one claim the 8 million reward 
since pettersson was arrested dec 14 news reports have 
questioned whether pettersson a heavy drinker and user of 
amphetamines could have kept his mouth shut about the killing 
doubts will continue to gnaw because pettersson doesnt fit 
the picture of the killer of a prime minister said ulla 
bondeson a criminologist from malmo no official investigation 
can ever kill the speculation she said 
this verdict is the worst possible conclusion the national 
trauma will continue said political commentator yrsa stenius 
there is no motive no logical chain of events leading up to the 
incident 
palmes international stature and involvement in disarmament 
issues gave rise to theories of international intrigue 
investigators focused on possible conspiracies during the first 
year most centered on militant kurdish exiles angered at a 
crackdown by palmes social democratic government 
the iranian regime of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the iraqi 
secret service were among others suspected those theories were 
eventually dismissed as groundless but speculation is bound to 
haunt the case 
four hours before palme was shot the files on a tax 
investigation against him disappeared in a breakin at the county 
administrative appeals court 
all computer files were obliterated and all documents stolen no 
connection with the murder was ever established 
among many initial lines of inquiry later dropped were accounts 
that palme was followed by men with walkietalkies these reports 
led to speculation of a rightwing plot by policemen against the 
leftist premier 
several stockholm policemen were questioned and released well 
before the arrest of pettersson

the elks is still a menonly 
organization but in the future more of those men may be nonwhite 
members voted against admitting women and for doing away with 
the elks blackball rule at a closed business meeting thursday 
on the final day of the benevolent and protective order of elks 
125th annual convention 
repeal of the blackball rule was approved at the urging of the 
elks lodge at lompoc calif two black applicants there were 
blackballed recently and as a result the california attorney 
generals office is investigating possible civil rights violations 
the old policy allowed any three members of an elks lodge to 
reject or blackball a prospective member some said that made 
it difficult for blacks to join the elks 
under the new policy a twothirds majority of a lodges 
membership could approve a new member 
i think it was a step forward it was a rule that has caused 
problems for a number of lodges i think everyone felt it was time 
to change said william wodarczak the exalted ruler of the 
1800member santa barbara lodge 
in lompoc about 35 miles northwest of santa barbara two black 
men whose membership bids were rejected said they planned to 
reapply 
im elated at the outcome said ernie hutchinson 57 a 
local housing official im proud of the lodge here because they 
spearheaded this thing 
hutchinson said he plans to reapply immediately should he be 
accepted i dont think there will be a strain i am not going in 
with any animosity 
joe martin 56 also said he was pleased by the vote 
i am a bit surprised though but it restores my faith in 
america said martin a real estate agent 
while the elks do have some black members nationally several 
california lodges threatened legal action if rules were not changed 
to allow more minority representation in the groups 2300 lodges 
members also voted overwhelmingly against the resolution to 
admit women said donald d dapelo the newly installed grand 
exalted ruler 
sexism was not behind the rejection of female membership dapelo 
said 
i think perhaps it could also be considered that the elks are 
interested in protecting the rights of women to have their own 
organization just like we have dapelo said and there are 
twice as many of those so i am told 
elks boast a nationwide membership of roughly 15 million but 
membership has been declining and those who wanted to admit women 
said that might remedy the problem 
dapelo disagreed 
its a fact that we dont see too many of our members standing 
in line to join those ladies organizations either 
an estimated 12000 people attended the convention

the licenses of two las vegas slot 
machine companies were suspended after gaming authorities found 
evidence that keno and video poker games were rigged to prevent 
players from hitting jackpots 
the alleged slotrigging involved american coin enterprises and 
american coin machine co 
the nevada gaming commission voted thursday to temporarily 
suspend more than 30 licenses held by the two companies after 
getting an emergency request wednesday from its enforcement arm 
the state gaming control board 
the principals in the companies are rudolph lavecchia and frank 
romano lavecchias son also named rudolph is a principal in 
american coin enterprises all are from las vegas 
a woman who answered the telephone at american coin machine said 
only we dont have any comment right now at american coin 
enterprises a woman also declined to comment and said the 
lavecchias and romano were not available 
the companies have electronic games at 94 locations mainly bars 
and taverns in the las vegas area gaming control board agents 
began seizing machines on wednesday and continued the roundup on 
thursday 
commission chairman john oreilly said the control boards 
allegations are extremely serious and warranted the license 
suspension pending further review 
control board chairman bill bible said his agents found evidence 
that the machines had been altered in a manner that cheats the 
players by altering the odds of hitting a jackpot 
board agents said the changes prevent players from hitting a 
highpaying royal flush on the companies video poker machine and 
also prevent a big keno payoff 
the control board released an affidavit from agent ron harris 
saying an investigation started in june after the board got 
information that slots had unapproved computer chips or eproms 
which determine how the devices operate 
the american coin machines were sealed july 14 and unsealed only 
after the computer chips were replaced in all the machines the 
board said 
but the control board said further investigation this week by 
its lab technicians and agents revealed more unapproved features in 
the slot machines which the board determined to be cheating 
devices 
asked whether there was any evidence of complicity on the part 
of bar or tavern owners who got machines from the companies bible 
said it is an ongoing part of this investigation 
american coin enterprises and american coin machine co hold 
licenses as slot route operators manufacturers and distributors of 
slot machines

the arrest of a leading communist 
figure has been hailed as a major blow to the rebels but the 
insurgency that has persisted for two decades has weathered the 
capture of other key figures 
satur ocampo 50 a member of the communist partys central 
committee was arrested thursday in a manila suburb with his 
commonlaw wife carolina malay 
his arrest will hit the party quite hard because of his 
position in the movement said military chief of staff gen 
renato de villa 
maj gen ramon montano chief of the philippine constabulary 
said the arrest was the beginning of the end of southeast 
asias last major communist insurgency 
but in an editorial friday the independent philippine daily 
globe said we have had days like this before despite all the 
hoopla the insurgency simply moved on renewing itself and 
becoming more resilient than ever 
a leftist human rights group also expressed concern that 
ocampos arrest diminished chances for resuming peace talks to end 
the 20year insurgency 
most likely the leadership will go deeper underground and 
might answer the military operations with countermilitary 
actions the ecumenical movement for justice and peace said 
peace will be as elusive as ever 
ocampos arrest follows claims by the military that the rebels 
are in disarray because of leadership differences the rebels 
gained strength during the authoritarian rule of ousted president 
ferdinand marcos but have not found a formula for promoting their 
cause under the more popular administration of president corazon 
aquino 
about 10 members of the central committee have been arrested 
since 1987 although one of them romulo kintanar escaped the 
military claims the partys armed wing the new peoples army has 
declined by about 8 percent to about 23500 fighters only half of 
whom are fully armed 
during a press conference shortly after his arrest ocampo 
insisted that his capture will make little difference 
the organization is a big one he said there is a long 
wide bench with responsible comrades who would take over 
such bravado was to be expected but the rebellion has persisted 
despite past arrests of its leaders and despite improvements in the 
economy under mrs aquino 
the party grew after its founder jose maria sison and the new 
peoples army commander bernabe buscayno were arrested in 1976 
they were released in 1986 after mrs aquino took power 
those arrested since mrs aquino took office include 
secretarygeneral rafael baylosis and chairman rodolfo salas 
we should not be lulled into complacency said senate 
president jovito salonga they seem to have replacements for 
captured leaders 
the partys base remains the impoverished rural areas where 70 
percent of the 58 million filipinos live the government admits 
that the poorest third of all filipinos still control only 9 
percent of the national income virtually no change from the final 
years of marcos administration 
but ocampos capture was a propaganda coup because he was one of 
the few rebels widely known by the public but it is unclear how 
much influence ocampo wielded on rebel policy or in the new peoples 
army 
during a 60day ceasefire declared in december 1986 ocampo 
and malay appeared on numerous radio and television shows urging 
the government to accept their demands to end the fighting 
after the ceasefire ended ocampo gave clandestine interviews 
and issued statements in the name of the party he was believed in 
charge of recruiting among youth teachers clerics farmers and 
other groups 
at the time of their arrest ocampo and malay were living a 
block from the makati police station 
the anonymous nature of the rebel leadership has been one of its 
strengths philippine politics revolves around personalities but 
the communists have no charismatic figures whose arrests would 
shatter the movement 
national security adviser rafael ileto admits the military is 
not even sure who runs the party the military has variously named 
sison who lives in the netherlands kintanar and benito tiamzon 
as party chairman 
unlike communist rebellions in thailand vietnam and elsewhere 
in the region filipino rebels are not openly supported by any 
foreign government china and the soviet union have both assured 
mrs aquino of their support for her 
but the partys ability to survive without foreign support also 
shows the resilience of the communist movement which dates back to 
1930 
even if were captured many more will take our place as long 
as the government continues to ignore the plight of the people 
malay said

federal prosecutors have conceded defeat in 
the governments effort to prosecute six people charged with 
capturing or killing wild horses and burros in rural nevada 
we underestimated the difficulty of proving these cases 
bill maddox the us attorney for nevada said thursday by 
telephone from his las vegas office we didnt do a very good 
job 
on wednesday us district judge howard mckibben gave maddox 
permission to drop charges against the two remaining defendants in 
a muchpublicized case that grew from the suspected slaughter of 
some 600 mustangs in central nevada 
dave morehead and shannon brennan were scheduled to go on trial 
aug 8 
i just took a very critical look at the case and in my 
opinion we would have had a very difficult time proving their 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt maddox explained this type of 
case needs to be handled like a homicide and with the information 
we had that was too difficult 
don hill an attorney representing morehead said the government 
would have been wasting the courts time to go forward and 
commended maddox for having the courage to admit there wasnt 
enough evidence 
morehead 38 a foreman at the cpunch ranch 70 miles north of 
lovelock and ranchhand brennan 21 were charged with killing 
about 40 horses and burros the charges are misdemeanor violations 
of the federal wild free roaming horse and burro protection act 
the two were riding the range thursday and could not be reached 
for comment but dave moreheads wife said they were relieved 
we were hoping theyd drop charges a long time ago because 
they never had anything to begin with vina morehead said in a 
telephone interview from her northcentral nevada home 
its been the worst time of our lives its just thrown us 
into a tizzy he should never have been charged in the first 
place 
the original indictment was issued in january after months of 
investigation following the bureau of land managements discovery 
of hundreds of dead mustangs over a vast area of northcentral 
nevada 
bureau investigators believe the wild horses were shot over a 
period of about two years but the condition of many of the 
carcasses made it impossible to determine whether they were killed 
or died of natural causes 
last week a jury returned an innocent verdict in the case of 
betty irwin a 63yearold california woman whos part owner of the 
sprawling cpunch ranch 
jury members said there wasnt enough evidence to convict her of 
misdeameanor charges of attempting to convert a wild burro into a 
pet 
nearly a month ago us district judge edward reed dismissed 
charges against cousins eugene skeeter thacker a 27yearold 
cowboy and ronald hage a 23yearold miner reed said the 
government didnt specify exactly which five horses the pair 
allegedly killed 
assistant us attorney will mattley earlier dropped charges 
against a sixth defendant when the accused proved he wasnt in 
nevada at the time he allegedly killed mustangs

if the federal government had the staff to 
audit upperincome americans it could collect billions of dollars 
in unpaid taxes says a study sponsored by a democratic group

hospital workers are doing too little to protect 
themselves from the aids virus even though one in 16 
emergencyroom patients was found to be infected at a major medical 
center last year a study has found 
health workers failed to take adequate precautions such as 
wearing gloves masks and gowns 66 percent of the time during a 
sixweek study period in the emergency room at johns hopkins 
hospital in baltimore researchers said 
the failure rate for taking precautions rose to more than 80 
percent when patients were bleeding rapidly said the researchers 
led by dr gabor d kelen of the hospitals emergency department 
many of the workers who included doctors nurses and 
technicians said putting on protective gear was too difficult or 
timeconsuming or they believed the gear might get in their way 
the researchers said 
such responses were made even though it had been reported that 
52 percent of emergencyroom patients at johns hopkins were 
infected with the aids virus in 1987 up to 6 percent by 1988 the 
researchers said 
the aids virus is believed to be passed mainly through sexual 
intercourse and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles 
among drug abusers but healthcare workers are in danger of 
catching it from needle pricks blood sprayed to the eyes nose or 
mouth or from getting infected fluids on skin cuts 
at least 169 health care workers nationwide have become infected 
with the virus through contact with patients according to the 
federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
johns hopkins had tried to educate staffers at all levels about 
the need to wear protective clothing and had displayed 10 highly 
visible posters outlining recommended precautions in strategic 
areas of the emergency department researchers said 
in addition gloves masks gowns and goggles had been placed at 
the entrances of rooms where they might be needed they wrote in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
still health care workers took inadequate precautions 
particularly in those situations that most called for them the 
researchers said 
overall workers donned needed gear 44 percent of the time they 
found basing data on direct observations 
in patients with profuse bleeding the rate fell to 195 
percent the researchers said 
in procedures requiring only gloves those that might involve 
contact with blood or other body fluids but were unlikely to 
involve being sprayed by such fluids workers wore gloves 648 
percent of the time they found 
but for procedures requiring gloves mask gown and goggles 
those in which a worker might get sprayed with body fluids the 
rate of wearing adequate gear plummeted to 165 percent the study 
found 
the johns hopkins study found 152 infected people among 2544 
patients treated in the emergency room during the research period 
ninetyfive of them showed no signs of infection and didnt know 
they were carrying the aids virus researchers said 
being infected with the virus does not necessarily mean a person 
has acquired immune deficiency syndrome because the virus can be 
present for years before symptoms of the deadly disease begin to 
appear 
the total number of aids cases reported since 1979 is 99936 of 
whom 58014 have died the cdc says

the opening of the menominee county fair 
centers once again around the theuerkauf family 
last year fair manager shirley charlier began the festival by 
handing carl theuerkauf a plaque commemorating the centennial of 
his familys dairy farm 
today charlier planned to start the fair with a moment of 
silence theuerkauf and four family members died one by one 
wednesday as they tried to save each other from suffocating in a 
manure storage pit 
dead were farm patriarch carl theuerkauf sr 65 sons carl jr 
37 and tom 28 grandson daniel 15 and nephew bill hofer 63 
the elder theuerkauf would have celebrated his 66th birthday 
saturday a sheriffs deputy said instead the farmer will be 
buried that day 
the entire county is grieving 
people are devastated said charlier somebody asked why 
would they do that i dont know if i could say if one of my 
children had fallen in the river if i would use my reason and not 
go and help 
menominee county officials believe four of the men died on 
missions of mercy 
im sure that when one person slipped or fell out of love and 
for help one after another went in said richard breyer with the 
county farm extension service its just something there will not 
be an answer as to why it had to be five people 
the five men were using a pump to empty the partially covered 
12foot deep concrete pit wednesday morning and were almost 
finished when the drainage pump clogged 
hofer descended into the darkness to clear the blockage instead 
of air he breathed methane gas and collapsed 
police can only theorize what happened next since everyone who 
saw the incident died 
its unknown which one went in next but eventually they all 
went in to save the rest said menominee county sheriffs deputy 
booth whipp 
county medical examiner dr paul haupt estimates it took about 
90 seconds for each of the men to collapse and suffocate in the 
invisible cloud of gas 
methane is an odorless gas that can be generated by animal 
waste the pit collects manure from the dairy barn until it can be 
moved to an outdoor pit or loaded into a manure spreader 
a week of very hot humid weather likely caused the deadly 
methane gas to build up faster than usual breyer said 
whipp said he believed the theuerkaufs realized the danger but 
they were more concerned with their loved ones 
a funeral for the four theuerkaufs will be held at christ 
evangelical lutheran church on saturday a service for hofer will 
be held later that same day at faith lutheran church in marinette 
breyer said close to 1000 area residents helped the theuerkaufs 
celebrate the centennial of their farm last summer and he said the 
elder theuerkauf was named michigan farm manager of the year 
several years ago the dairy farm near the wisconsin line had more 
than 250 cows and was one of the largest in michigans upper 
peninsula 
former farmhands are pitching in to keep the farm running 
were all stunned and shocked by it said harry theuerkauf 
the elder theuerkaufs brother who owns a milwaukee law firm 
its hard to grasp they all are going to be missed everybody 
had plans for the fifth generation of theuerkaufs to take over the 
farm now things are up in the air 
i wish there was an easy way to cope with this

outgoing us customs service commissioner 
william von raab has accused the federal government of lacking the 
commitment to win the war on drugs 
von raab who is leaving office next week after being forced to 
resign his position of eight years said in a report today in the 
new york times that drugfighting efforts were not working 
senior officials were too preoccupied with other problems 
according to von raab who has played a major role in combating 
drugs during the reagan and bush administrations 
he said secretary of state james a baker iii was worried about 
eastern europe treasury secretary nicholas f brady only cared 
about third world debt and fixing the troubled savings and loan 
industry and dick thornburgh the attorney general was concerned 
about jurisdictional matters at the justice department 
im very concerned that there is not enough real commitment of 
a deepseated nature among the members of the administration bar 
one or two like jack kemp or bill bennett that is necessary to 
drive a tough winning drug policy von raab said 
kemp is secretary of housing and urban development and william 
bennett was appointed by president bush as the nations drug czar 
referring to unnamed officials as country club republicans 
the commissioner said you cannot have a cabinet secretary or a 
senior official in a department take the position that we cannot 
get ourselves too deeply into this exercise because it will become 
another vietnam 
if we dont approach this war with the intention of winning it 
and doing whats necessary to win it we wont win it he said 
and that means you have got to have fire in your belly to want to 
win it 
some officials dismissed von raabs remarks one treasury 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said von raab felt 
rebuked by the appointment of a new commissioner others said he 
was angered because he had been passed over for drug czar a newly 
created position in the bush administration 
von raab told abc news that bush along with bennett is 
committed toward stemming the flow of illegal drugs into the 
country but blasted the state department for having a cowardly 
streak about drugs 
he also warned little is being done while bennett prepares his 
program 
its just out of control von raab said and in that sense 
our national policy has been a total and abysmal failure 
he said the united states has failed to apply political and 
economic pressure against drugproducing countries which allow 
traffickers to roam freely 
they feel no pressure whatsoever he said in the television 
interview they are happily living out their lives as feudal 
barons in the hills of colombia peru and bolivia and no ones 
touching them including the united states theres so much cocaine 
out there that we cant control it 
after a us drug agent was killed in 1985 by drug dealers in 
mexico von raab sealed the border to pressure the mexican 
government into finding the killers

david horning started his day with a swim 
in paris and ended it splashing in san francisco bay in a marathon 
dip marking his 41st birthday and the 200th anniversary of the 
french revolution 
is this san francisco the sports promoter laughed as he 
emerged from the bay thursday night after swimming 1 miles from 
alcatraz island to aquatic park near fishermans wharf 
the swim down the seine in paris was wonderful he said but 
the final leg in san francisco took 45 minutes a bit longer than 
anticipated 
the ebb tide was stronger than i expected horning said 
horning failed to complete his initial plan which included an 
additional swim from the statue of liberty in new york to battery 
park at the tip of manhattan airplane connection problems scuttled 
that effort 
the swims are the easy part said horning its catching 
the planes that can be tricky 
anyway he did manage to swim to one statue of liberty 
he swam through paris from the bastille to the littleknown 
french statue of liberty on an island in the seine down river from 
the eiffel tower the statue is a reducedscale version of the one 
in new york harbor americans gave it to france in thanks for 
frances gift of the original to the united states 
the swim in france took 1 hour and 15 minutes making his total 
time in the water thursday two hours 
such ventures are not unusual for horning who lives in nearby 
berkeley 
last year he marked his 40th birthday by swimming under 40 
bridges in moscow new york and san francisco 
why does he do it 
im an epileptic and i hope this gives others confidence to do 
what they want to do he said shortly after getting out of the 
water to the applause of a small crowd of friends relatives and 
reporters

sudanese rebels said today they had 
agreed to peace talks with sudans new military rulers but that no 
date had been set 
maj deng alor a spokesman for the sudan peoples liberation 
army said only that he hoped the talks he described as preliminary 
would begin soon 
sudans leader lt gen omar hassan elbashir said thursday 
that the talks would begin in early august elbashir said the 
sudanese government delegation would include one member of the 
15member junta that ousted an elected civilian government in 
khartoum june 30 
deng said the rebel delegation would include a highranking 
member of the rebels military command but rebel leader john garang 
would not take part in the preliminary discussions 
the talks to be held in ethiopias capital addis ababa are 
aimed at ending sudans 6yearold civil war which has killed and 
displaced millions of people and created waves of refugees into 
countries neighboring sudan 
the rebel movement which is headquartered in addis ababa took 
up arms against khartoums moslemdominated government in 1983 
demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms for the nations 
predominantly christian and ethnically african south 
in an interview published july 13 elbashir said he would agree 
to partition of his country if southern residents decide it would 
end the civil war the united arab emirates newspaper alkhaleej 
quoted him as saying he would also accept forming a federation with 
southern sudan 
elbashir has said one of the reasons he ousted prime minister 
sadek elmahdis government was because it failed to end the war 
he ordered a unilateral ceasefire which rebels appear to have 
tacitly accepted 
un officials said earlier this month that sudans new military 
rulers and the rebels have pledged to cooperate with un efforts 
to save 100000 sudanese threatened by famine and disease 
food has been used as a weapon in the civil war and the united 
nations estimates 250000 sudanese died last year from starvation 
due to flood drought and warinduced famine

syrian and christian gunners pounded 
beirut today with an estimated 50000 shells and rockets killing 
at least 13 people in what police called beiruts night of terror 
and horror 
a police spokesman said 65 people were wounded in the eighthour 
bombardment which he called the heaviest shelling in the 
fourmonth standoff between gen michel aouns mainly christian 
troops and the syrian army 
were being killed in our beds beirut is being massacred 
and no one in the arab world or the outside world seems to care 
said an announcer on the christian voice of lebanon radio his 
voice choking with emotion 
the moslemcontrolled voice of the nation described the 
earsplitting artillery duel as a night of insane terror 
one grad rocket crashed into the top floor of the sevenstory 
building that houses the offices of the associated press and the 
television networks cbs and nbc 
the explosion blew me out of my bed i found myself flat on 
the floor with glass shards showering me said associated press 
correspondent farouk nassar who lives on the sixth floor of the 
building 
the blast shattered windows and sent pieces of furniture 
tumbling into the street 
screams for help echoed from nearby apartment buildings 
his leg is chopped off one woman shouted as she guided 
civil defense rescuers to the second floor of another building 
struck by a rocket 
the victim was jawhar aljawhari a druse janitor who was 
rushed to the american university hospital dozens of stretchers 
with screaming wounded crowded the hospitals emergency ward 
the un headquarters in west beirut and the soviet embassy 
compound also took direct hits but no casualties were reported 
among their staff police said 
shells tore wide holes in scores of highrise apartment 
buildings and hundreds of stores and boutiques had their iron 
shutters blown off 
the international committee of the red cross in beirut appealed 
for an immediate cessation of the indiscriminate bombardment 
the casualties raised the overall toll to 494 killed dead and 
2014 injured since the latest round in the 14year civil war 
fighting erupted march 8 
the police spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
an estimated 50000 shells and rockets were fired he called the 
bombardment the worst in four months in terms of firepower

pm when syrian gunners in west beirut and north lebanon hit 
jounieh east beirut and the christian port of byblos 
aouns troops and the lebanese forces the main christian 
militia retaliated with howitzer fire in west beirut the shelling 
tapered off around 4 am the spokesman added 
almost every part of beirut and jounieh were hit as if by a 
killer earthquake the spokesman said adding it was beiruts 
night of horror and terror 
the current confrontation erupted two days after aoun ordered 
his gunboats and helicopter gunships to blockade three illegal 
harbors run by moslem militias south of beirut 
he said the blockade was aimed at restoring state authority 
eroded during the civil war and to recoup an estimated 100 million 
a year in lost customs revenues 
druse warlord walid jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 
christian enclave north of beirut where aouns 20000 troops are 
stationed 
the syrians who maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league later joined in the 
shelling and enforced a sea and land blockade of the enclave

the ads showed jason who periodically rises to slash up a camp 
full of teenagers cutting through the heart of an i love new 
york poster 
the ads were promoting the eighth in the series of friday the

the new york athletic club which for 121 years 
was a bastion of male exclusivity has agreed to accept women as 
members 
the 10000member club decided thursday to end its holdout and 
join other previously menonly clubs that have agreed to admit 
women to comply with a 1984 city law upheld last year by the us 
supreme court 
i am very pleased that the new york athletic club has voted to 
admit women as members my only regret is that it did not do so 
sooner but alls well that ends well said mayor edward i koch 
a letter dated thursday to members from president wallace l 
beneville said the club was dropping with great regret its 
challenge to the city law in view of the high courts unanimous 
june 20 1988 decision 
beneville wrote that the clubs board of governors had reached 
agreement with the city commission on human rights that women 
properly sponsored by other members will be considered for 
membership on the same basis as male applicants 
in that connection however the women applicants will be 
subject to the same waiting list as our male applicants the 
letter said 
the human rights commission which has filed complaints against 
several menonly clubs in the past five years would not comment 
the city law governs clubs that have more than 400 members 
serve meals and rent facilities to nonmembers for business 
purposes such clubs cannot deny membership because of sex race 
creed color or national origin 
the new york state club association representing about 125 
clubs had challenged the law 
in his letter beneville said board members felt and still do 
feel that this law is an invalid governmental intrusion on our 
right of freedom of association we also felt that our membership 
should have the right of self determination ie to decide whom 
they wished to be members 
while we still feel strongly about this we have now reached 
the point where it appears that further litigation would be 
fruitless our counsel have advised us that in their view were we 
to pursue the case through the courts we would ultimately lose

pope john paul ii will visit mexico for a 
week in may and may take part in the canonization of juan diego 
the aztec peasant whose visions of the virgin mary gave mexico its 
patron saint 
several officials said the popes visit also may coincide with 
an official rapprochement between the mexican government and the 
church 
the foreign ministry said the mexican government gave its formal 
approval for the papal visit john pauls first to mexico since 
january 1979 
the trip was confirmed quite a long time ago the only thing 
that remained was the consent of the government monsignor genaro 
alamilla spokesman for the episcopal conference of mexicos roman 
catholic church told a news conference thursday 
it was not clear if the pope is intending to visit cuba on the 
overseas trip president fidel castro in january invited him to the 
communistruled country and cuban and vatican officials have held 
discussions since then 
church officials said the pope would tour several southern 
mexico states and may take part in a ceremony canonizing diego 
diego has already been beatified the nexttothelast step in 
attaining sainthood 
the constitution of this overwhelmingly catholic nation written 
when the church was considered closer to the upper classes than to 
most of the people does not recognize the church as a legal entity 
and bars priests from any political activity even voting 
however president carlos salinas de gortari said in his 
inaugural address dec 1 that it was time to revise relations 
between the church and the state 
representatives of the church and the government have been 
holding talks on the possibility of amending the constitution and 
opening relations with the vatican 
the papal visit is not a confirmation that these institutions 
will establish relations but we cant discard the possibility of 
an historical coincidence said archbishop juan jose posadas of 
guadalajara the head of the organizing committee for the papal 
visit 
monsignor geronimo prigione the vatican representative in 
mexico said the sevenday visit in may is not to steal power or 
press for a legal change in the churchstate relationship 
diegos visions of the virgin of guadalupe are regarded by many 
scholars as crucial to the conversion of mexico from a pagan 
indian nation to a catholic spanish colony 
contemporary accounts say diego first saw the virgin on dec 9 
1531 on a hillside where there had been a temple to the aztec 
goddess tonantzin she told him to tell the bishop she wanted her 
own temple built on the spot 
the bishop didnt believe diego and asked for proof the fourth 
time she appeared according to the accounts the virgin filled 
diegos cloak with outofseason roses the accounts say that when 
diego unfurled the cloak to show the roses to the bishops it was 
imprinted with the virgins portrait 
the cloak is the centerpiece of the main altar at the basilica 
of guadalupe in mexico city the shrine built on the site of 
diegos visions

ground miniature american flags planted along a street has been 
sentenced to six months in prison and fined 200 for flag 
desecration 
william frank erlston 22 was sentenced thursday by district 
justice william l breech 
police said erlston discarded the miniature american flags 
planted by members of the veterans of foreign wars for the fourth

political statement police said

protesters to burn flags as a protected form of free speech but 
erlston did not use that defense and instead pleaded guilty to 
flag desecration which in pennsylvania carries a maximum penalty 
of two years in prison and a fine of 5000

the investigation of the poisoning of a 
teenager who died after eating cyanidetainted yogurt has ended 
but the youths parents are still searching for answers 
investigators ruled thursday that thomas lee 17 of haddonfield 
committed suicide and had not been a victim of product tampering 
his parents frances and hsinyi lee a professor at rutgers 
university in camden angrily denounced the findings and said they 
did not believe their son committed suicide 
why would tom commit suicide frances lee said shortly after 
the couple both immigrants from taiwan were informed of the 
conclusion everyone who knows him said he was the last person 
who would commit suicide 
lee slipped into a coma in january after eating several 
spoonfuls of cyanidelaced breyers black cherry yogurt on his way 
to school he died on feb 7 at a hospital after he was removed 
from a respirator 
the resulting sixmonth investigation was to determine if the 
case should be treated as a homicide suicide or tampering 
on thursday camden county prosecutor samuel asbell said the 
hard facts indicate to us that it was suicide 
lee a high school junior was described by classmates as a 
wellliked artistic student investigators however said the 
youth left musical tapes and poetry indicating he had been 
depressed because of poor grades and thought about dying 
the poisoning prompted a tampering scare and led grocers in the 
midatlantic region to temporarily remove yogurt from shelves 
breyers said its investigation determined the cyanide did not 
originate at its plants 
asbell said the potassium cyanide found in the yogurt matched 
cyanide found in professor lees laboratory at rutgers lee is 
chairman of the biology department and is an awardwinning 
researcher recognized as an expert on early brain development 
asbell said thomas lee had a key to the laboratory and had 
visited it last summer 
the lees contend investigators bungled the probe misplacing a 
vial of cyanide found in a trash can outside the lee home 
asbell said the vial was examined by us food and drug 
administration officials in philadelphia he said it was lost when 
it was flown to an fbi lab in washington but he said a seal 
recovered from the vial did not contain any indentifiable 
fingerprints 
there is something very wrong in this investigation said 
mrs lee who has a masters degree in immunology i got the 
feeling they were trying to cover up 
a grand jury was convened to review the case the 23member 
panel adjourned in march without handing up an indictment

the state army national guard has confirmed 
reports that a group of soldiers and civilians has been stealing 
military automatic weapons parts and using them to assemble and 
sell rifles machine guns and pistols 
lt col peter kutschera spokesman for the guard said thursday 
that over the past seven years a substantial number of parts were 
stolen in western new york state and used in the assembly of at 
least 58 automatic or semiautomatic guns 
but he said a report in thursdays gannett westchester 
newspapers that entire weapons were stolen from the guard was 
unfounded and that all weapons were accounted for 
kutschera said evidence gathered by guard investigators and the 
us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms was being presented to 
federal prosecutors in buffalo 
sen pete wilson rcalif a member of the senate armed 
services committee who has held hearings on military weapons 
thefts called for an investigation by the us general accounting 
office 
this could very well be a national problem wilson said 
unfortunately were not surprised that this exists since the 
defense departments inventory system is so riddled with problems 
kutschera said the ring appeared to succeed because the 
military which audits fully assembled weapons in its arsenals each 
month conducts no such audits of weapon parts including barrels 
stocks and firing mechanisms 
the guard kutschera said has no accounting procedures to 
detect the loss of parts if theyre pilfered on a small basis 
trigger units do have serial numbers however and the ring 
apparently did not steal any of them from the guard but instead 
purchased others from civilian sources 
kutschera said the guard learned of the ring in march 1988 
through an unrelated investigation of sales of stolen military 
equipment and clothing to an armynavy store in the buffalo area a 
soldier accused of involvement in those sales informed 
investigators about the weapons ring 
according to investigators records members of the ring stole 
weapons parts from guard repair and supply facilities mostly in 
buffalo and rochester and reassembled them with serialnumbered 
nonmilitary parts then they were traded or sold

hashemi rafsanjani all but assured of 
victory in todays presidential election has begun forming a 
cabinet that includes economists and technocrats to help guide this 
troubled nation into the postkhomeini era sources say 
the early turnout in tehran was sluggish despite the 
exhortations of iranian leaders over the last few days for a 
massive demonstration of unity the opposition claimed there was 
little enthusiasm for the election 
only a few dozen people were seen at polling stations in tehran 
after they opened at 7 am although voting appeared to pick up 
later 
however interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi told tehran 
radio that voting was so heavy in some provinces that the polling 
stations are asking for more personnel because of the crowds 
he said polling was extended for two hours beyond the scheduled 
5 pm closing time 
there was no word on when the results would be announced the 
government did not say how many eligible voters there are but the 
number was estimated at 25 million about half the population 
during parliamentary elections last year 
the main iranian opposition group the mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors claimed polling was extremely quiet 
among the voters was rafsanjani the 55yearold parliament 
speaker and commander in chief who was so confident of victory he 
did not campaign 
rafsanjani voted at a special booth in the courtyard of the 
modest residence that belonged to the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini in the north tehran suburb of jamaran 
rafsanjani cast two votes in separate boxes one for the 
presidential ballot the other for a referendum on whether to 
increase the presidents powers before camera crews from irans 
staterun television 
im happy to see the people voting and this proves that the 
revolution is strong but im sorry the imam is no longer with 
us rafsanjani said khomeini was referred to as the imam a 
moslem term for religious leader 
about 100 revolutionary guards and local residents chanted god 
is great and cheered the turbanned rafsanjani a middleranking 
cleric as he cast his votes 
prosecutorgeneral mohammad musavi khoeniha who led the crowds 
that stormed the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 also 
voted at khomeinis house with other senior iranian religious and 
political figures 
iranian leaders and the state media for days have been exhorting 
iranians to turn out to demonstrate unity following the khomeinis 
death on june 3 
each vote cast is a bullet fired at the heart of irans 
enemies the radical jomhuri islami daily said this week 
but one disgruntled merchant who declined to be identified 
said why bother to vote rafsanjani has been part of the 
government for years and hes responsible with the other clerics 
for mess the economys in 
diplomatic sources speaking on the condition they not be 
identified say rafsanjani already has selected a cabinet that 
would include economists and technocrats some of them dumped from 
earlier administrations because of ideological and policy 
differences 
newspapers polls predict rafsanjani will win 86 percent of the 
vote 
the elections were moved up from aug 18 to accelerate the 
transition of power following the death of khomeini who founded 
the fundamentalist republic in 1979 that toppled the regime of the 
late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
also on the ballot is a referendum on proposed constitutional 
amendments that would give the presidency new powers khomeini 
urged the changes to eliminate competing power centers that have 
paralyzed the government 
incumbent president ali khameneis second fouryear term expires 
oct 5 and he cannot run for a third term he was elected irans 
spiritual leader to succeed khomeini on june 4 
khamenei is allied with rafsanjani who heads irans 
pragmatist faction they are expected to open up the economy 
which conservative radicals have kept under tight reins since the 
revolution and to build bridges with the west although that could 
take time

president wojciech jaruzelski challenged 
his fellow communists today to decide what their party stands for 
in a poland that has thrown its allegiance to the solidarityled 
opposition 
jaruzelski the party chief opened a crucial session of the 
central committee that is expected to result in a new leader for 
the first time in eight years and perhaps lead to fundamental 
changes in the party itself 
later in the meeting politburo member wladyslaw baka 
considered a candidate to become prime minister and a critic of 
outgoing prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski gave up his duties 
as the party leader in charge of the economy there was no 
immediate explanation 
the scheduled twoday meeting comes a month after the candidates 
backed by the newly legalized solidarity trade union movement 
captured 260 out of 261 seats they contested in the parliamentary 
elections 
jaruzelski who opened the meeting by thanking the party for 
helping to elect him president july 19 was expected to resign from 
the party leadership post he had held since 1981 in order to devote 
himself to the new office 
he told the meeting that it ould be one of the most 
important meetings since the last party congress in 1986 the 
states pap news service reported 
jaruzelski challenged the central committee to decide what as 
a party do we stand for what should we defend against what do we 
fight for and what tasks should we begin in pursuit of social 
support 
the party also heard reports on the nations poor economic 
situation by baka assessing the election results by politburo 
member janusz reykowski and on the probles and future of the party 
by politburo member marian orzechowski 
state radio reported that baka at the end of his speech quit as 
economic secretary for the central committee the resignation could 
be to free him to take the prime ministers job or it could 
indicate that he has lost out in a power struggle with rakowski 
in his speech baka had pointedly criticized rakowskis 
government as lacking stubbornness and consistency in its 
handling of the economy 
reykowski expressed hope that the elections will have a 
curative effect on the party and spur it to change its ways of 
functioning as soon as possible pap reported 
most of society has had enough of the party as it has been 
secondly a significant part of the party grass roots has had 
enough of the style and ways of functioning of the party 
leadership orzechowski said according to pap 
going into todays meeting some party members said the 
230member central committee may call for a party congress the 
first in three years to consider dissolving the 2 millionmember 
party and forming new groupings on the left 
the party also was expected to be consulted on jaruzelskis 
choice to succeed prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski who has 
submitted his resignation as premier but is believed interested in 
succeeding jaruzelski as first secretary 
on thursday one unidentified regional official quoted by state 
radio said the party congress considered for later this year 
should be the last congress in the history of the party i 
think that new parties should be created where everyone would be 
able to find a place for himself 
after the partys june thrashing in the parliamentary elections 
the freest in 40 years a central committee official told 
reporters this polish party cannot win elections this communist 
party will not win elections the official speaking on condition 
of anonymity suggested that radical reforms were necessary 
splitting the party into a leftist or social democratic party 
and a more orthodox communist party appeared to be favored by 
reformists in the party close to jaruzelski but rakowski has 
opposed such division 
rakowski argues that a united communist party should protect 
living standards and win support by appealing to economic issues 
jaruzelski 66 was appointed party first secretary in october

the battle of the poisoned treaty oak goes 
on with a selfdescribed tree wizard claiming the centuriesold 
majestic oak is dead and city forestry experts disagreeing 
the wizard who rode to the rescue from his home in pennsylvania 
on 1000 raised by friends said the citys latest antidote was 
the final nail in the coffin 
i felt the spirit of the tree leave said stephen redding 
42 of green lane pa who stayed near the tree for six days 
sleeping on a park bench 
city officials thursday insisted the tree is clinging to life 
and that their rescue attempts were devised by experts 
the tree was poisoned at least four months ago with an 
herbicide a 45yearold man has been charged with felony criminal 
mischief in what authorities say was a ritual poisoning 
the tree is called treaty oak because legend has it that texas 
patriarch stephen f austin made peace with indians under its 
branches 
john giedraitis city forester and several experts ordered the 
injection of a saltwater solution into treaty oak in more than 100 
places earlier this week to offset the herbicide velpar 
the tree has huge amounts of poison in it giedraitis said 
experts decided to use the saltwater solution after tests showed 
twigs on the tree had no carbohydrates or energy reserves he said 
he said the injection process is standard technology 
redding who says he owns a tree maintenance business said the 
treatment hurt the tree 
in my opinion that oak expired at 520 pm tuesday when 
the crews started injecting the solution he said 
he also complained that the city applied sewer sludge around the 
roots but giedraitis said the sludge is a mild organic fertilizer 
that to trees is like chicken broth 
geidraitis said redding is a tree lover but he doesnt 
understand what is exactly going on in the tree hes a little on 
the wrong track 
redding said if that tree is alive a year from now ill 
invite the public to throw rotten tomatoes at me

communist party leaders today ordered the breakup 
of a major trade company linked to senior leader deng xiaopings 
son and announced audits of other leading companies in its most 
serious attack yet on corruption 
a notice handed down by the party politburo a top 
decisionmaking body also ordered an end to the banquets bribes 
foreign jaunts and luxury cars enjoyed by many high officials and 
put limits on what their children can do for a living 
the notice read on the national television news said the 
politburo acted to inspire party spirit and the peoples 
aspirations by starting first from the leaders in the party central 
committee and the state council the state council is chinas 
cabinet 
it called for a spirit of hard work and plain living one of 
the leaderships favorite slogans since it crushed student 
prodemocracy protests in june and purged party general secretary 
zhao ziyang 
the protests showed public confidence in the leadership to be at 
an alltime low as hundreds of thousands of people rallied to the 
students slogan oppose corruption 
among other things the students lampooned children of high 
officials who enjoy high posts in government and business 
including dengs son deng pufang whom they nicknamed prince 
pufang 
the politburo ordering that corruption be investigated no 
matter who is involved said a company linked to deng pufang will 
be disbanded 
the kang hua development corp was formed under the auspices of 
the younger dengs china welfare fund for the handicapped and it 
allegedly used the connection to evade taxes while developing into 
one of chinas largest foreign trade companies 
the politburo also ordered an audit of the china international 
trade and investment corp the countrys leading company for 
attracting foreign investment 
it gave the spouses and children of high officials until 
sept 1 to resign from jobs in goods distribution companies but did 
not list any names the politburo notice also 
ordered a shakeup of state companies dealing in foreign trade 
material supplies and finance 
banned party politburo secretariat and state council personnel 
from driving imported cars and exchanging banquets and gifts paid 
for with state funds 
said all trips abroad by leading officials should be for 
work only not inspection an apparent euphemism for tourism 
ordered an end to the practice of providing special supplies of 
scarce food items to high officials and said they would have to buy 
all their food at the market price instead of at discount 
as early as the 1960s the public image of chinas communist 
leaders had changed from that of spartan revolutionaries to a 
pampered elite but it took the economic decentralization of the 
past decade and rapid growth in incomes to add bribery and black 
marketeering to the list of official privileges 
the party has issued repeated orders in recent years to cut 
spending on luxuries and crack down on corruption all with little 
effect however none of the orders have been as sweeping 
the latest move also comes in a crisis atmosphere as party 
leaders warn that the student movement disclosed weaknesses in 
party organization and political education

cynthia wine 
since 1987 when the florida legislature made sweeping changes 
in the states gun laws concealed weapons permits have been issued 
by the state instead of counties and background checks done by the

computer check for felony convictions 
since the relaxed requirements of the state law took effect 
thousands of concealedweapon permits have been issued in south 
florida where only a few hundred had been issued before 
the 1987 law preempted tough local standards said state sen 
howard forman 
in broward county for example you had to not only have a job 
and an address but your occupation had to be one in which your life 
was in danger on a regular basis said forman a former broward 
county commissioner hollywood is in broward county

he could face the death penalty if convicted of first degree murder 
he is facing nebraska felony charges of attempted assault on a

the nebraska charges he faces a maximum of 20 years in jail and a 
25000 fine said judge cg wallace of kimball county who 
presided over the keith county court hearing 
wallace scheduled an aug 22 preliminary hearing

alexander besaraba sr 69 of new york city 
the elder besaraba said his son had been arrested several times 
and had been convicted of a crime in boston several years ago but 
he was uncertain of details police said a national crime computer

furnitureat the australian embassy the washington times reported 
today 
an embassy spokesman said an internal investigation was launched 
three weeks ago when the newspaper first questioned officials about 
the womans story but has developed no evidence to corroborate her 
account 
we have not been able to corroborate this story and with the 
processes we have in place we would have expected to have found 
something if such a gathering took place spokesman brett bayly 
told the associated press 
he said all guests have to sign into the building and would need 
an escort to enter nonpublic areas 
bayly said embassy officials were continuing their investigation 
and have been in touch with american authorities he declined 
to be more specific when asked to identify the us officials or 
agencies that had been contacted 
the times said the woman also provided accounts of paid sexual 
encounters with a canadian diplomat and a soldier who also acted as 
a bodyguard to washington lobbyist and host craig j spence and the 
newspaper said it was able to confirm these accounts 
the times had previously identified spence as a major client of 
a homosexual prostitution ring that allegedly involved the escort 
service for which the prostitute said she worked 
the us attorneys office in washington reportedly is 
investigating credit card fraud involving escort services 
according to the times the woman said she and the two other 
prostitutes had sex with at least three men each at the australian 
embassy and that she was paid 800 in crisp new 100 bills 
after the party the newspaper said the woman asked not to be 
identified 
kunjurit singh who operates jet set escort service confirmed 
to the times that his agency employed the three women last 
november singh said he would not release details of clients and 
said the agency does not condone and is not aware of any illegal 
sexual activities by its employees 
the newspaper said the woman provided a detailed description of 
the embassy party she said the men took me one at a time into 
a room which was like an office it had officetype furniture 
she said the men did not identify themselves 
the newspaper said it questioned embassy officials about the 
womans account on july 6 and was told officials would investigate 
it said the embassys minister for congressional liaison john 
mccarthy later told the newspaper that the internal investigation 
had found the womans story improbable although it had not 
ruled out the possibility that such a party was held 
the embassys investigations produced no corroboration of the 
allegations said a report on the review 
the times said the woman provided a list of embassy officials 
who she said were clients including a canadian diplomat who 
initially denied and then confirmed his involvement the newspaper 
did not identify the official but quoted him as saying his personal 
life was none of the newspapers business

the crippled oil tanker exxon valdez is still 
aiming for a sunday arrival in san diego bay but the war of words 
between state officials and exxon isnt over 
the valdez which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil after 
slamming into a reef in alaska must pass final navigational and 
environmental tests before being allowed into the bay for extensive 
repairs at the national steel and shipbuilding co coast guard lt 
larry solberg said thursday 
the ship will be required to execute a series of maneuvers 
offshore to simulate what it will have to do once inside the harbor 
and it also must pass a final underwater inspection when it reaches 
the mouth of the bay 
a series of suspicious oily spills and other problems off the 
california coast caused state officials to halt the exxon valdez so 
tests could be conducted and emergency repairs could be made 
test results confirm that recent slicks that were reported in 
the vicinity of the valdez could not have come from the 
valdez frank iarossi president of exxon shipping co said 
thursday in a statement 
state environmental officials said iarossi was mistaken 
i have not seen any results that indicate that said lt 
reed smith pollutionresponse coordinator for the california 
department of fish and game 
im quite concerned that we have a company that has had 
releases of oil from its ship and which denies having releases 
that heightens my concern 
smith said his department and the coast guard have gathered 
evidence of three separate releases of oil from the exxon valdez 
since it arrived off the coast of san diego 
exxon officials said following the devastating oil spill in 
alaska that the valdez was oilfree and that towing it southward 
presented no threat to the environment 
among stipulations of an agreement reached wednesday with exxon 
was one requiring it to have no discharges for 24 hours before any 
attempt to enter the bay 
the valdez has been about 50 miles offshore for the past two 
weeks since the coast guard ordered it away from the bay until any 
leakage problems were solved 
exxon has put up 20 million to guarantee the valdezs 
performance in the bay and to cover the costs of a cleanup should a 
spill occur

the only arab ever to head an israeli diplomatic 
mission is leaving his post as consul general in atlanta 
mohammed khalid massarwa 46 said thursday that the israeli 
foreign ministry told him his twoyear term would not be extended 
because the ministry was considering closing the atlanta consulate 
an israeli embassy spokesman in washington david peleg said 
there are no immediate plans to close the consulate he would not 
discuss the reasons for not extending massarwas appointment 
much of atlantas jewish community supported massarwa as 
evidence of israels commitment to pluralistic democracy 
first and foremost i thought it was terrific to have him 
here said harriet zimmerman a vice president of the american 
israel public affairs committee i have a lot of respect for 
him 
but critics who campaigned for massarwas return to israel said 
the ministry is dismissing him because of his comments favoring a 
palestinian homeland 
jay starkman leader of a massarwa must go campaign also 
said an arab could not properly represent the jewish state 
israeli foreign minister moshe arens had denounced massarwa for 
comments he made last summer in a speech to the atlanta chapter of 
the united nations association two israeli newspapers reported in 
september that massarwa said allowing the palestinians to establish 
a homeland might solve israels security problems 
massarwas statement conflicted with the policy of israels 
governing likud bloc the rival labor party was responsible for 
massarwas appointment in 1987

the house rules committee has rejected an 
amendment that would tie the future of some military bases to an 
audit a measure that some lawmakers hoped would keep their 
installations open 
the move means the amendment will likely be dropped next week 
when the military construction bill is considered by the house 
the committee which sets the ground rules for votes on the 
house floor said thursday that the amendment violated rules that 
bar legislating in spending bills 
the committee however delivered a victory to supporters of the 
presidio a san franciso base that has been ordered to close 
when the military construction bill goes to a floor vote 
lawmakers will be allowed to offer an amendment that would keep the 
base open 
as you can see a little favoritism was played by the rules 
committee said rep ed madigan rill whose district includes 
chanute air force base one of several that was covered by the 
amendment rejected by the rules committee 
madigan said he will ask lawmakers to defeat the rules when the 
military construction bill comes up next week but he added i 
dont think that effort will be successful 
the amendment as approved by the appropriations committee on 
wednesday would have prevented the government from closing some 
bases unless a audit found the savings to the pentagon over six 
years exceeds the cost of closure or reorganization 
these bases ordered to close or reorganize were affected by 
the rules committee action

the pianist pounds the keys to a ragtime beat 
as the choir members dressed in white hit the center isle 
clapping and singing 
here i am in the service one more time the choir sings as 
worshipers pick up the beat and join in 
yes lord here i am shouts an elderly woman as amen 
resounds throughout the church 
the scene varies little from that at the black baptist church 
around the corner but this is the 1030 gospel mass at st monica 
catholic church 
the priest and the congregation are mindful of a controversy in 
washington dc where the rev george stallings jr has accused 
the catholic church of failing its parishioners 
if they could be with us today all those people worrying 
about whats going on in washington would know weve already united 
our heritage and our faith the rev thaddeus c boucree tells 
the st monica congregation 
stallings wants to form an africanamerican catholic rite which 
he says would still be part of the catholic church he was 
suspended by the roman catholic archdiocese of washington after 
holding services with what he says is a brand of catholicism that 
better serves blacks 
but in new orleans several mostly black catholic churches have 
already adapted the mass to fit their style of worship combining 
gospel music and revivalstyle preaching with the traditional 
catholic liturgy 
we worship god not just from the eyebrows to the top of the 
head we worship with our whole bodies boucree said 
louisianas seven dioceses have more black catholics per capita 
than any other state in the new orleans archdiocese there are 
100000 black catholics one of the reasons pope paul ii visited 
the city in september 1987 was to speak to black catholic leaders 
with all the options to adapt the mass now available to priests 
the rev kenneth j hedrick director of the office of worship for 
the new orleans archdiocese said he is not sure how much farther 
stallings wants to go 
i think you can see from the black churches in new orleans the 
current liturgy is easily adaptable to any culture not just the 
black culture you can use nonsecular readings but you can 
certainly make use of many kinds of religious music and writings 
he said 
but stallings has his supporters among new orleans black 
catholics the rev glenn v jeanmarie pastor of st theresa of 
the child jesus said stallings call for change goes deeper than 
the liturgy 
what rev stallings is saying is for effective and true 
evangelism to take place in a community not only cultural needs but 
aspirations must also be addressed just as you have an eastern 
rite you should have an africanamerican rite basically were 
talking about respecting the leadership of black americans he 
said 
jeanmarie said the rite would not mean a split in the church 
its a myth to say this will create division when in reality 
there already exists in america and in the church a division 
because of racism this is a way to address that racism 
jeanmarie said 
boucree said most black catholics will be faithful to the 
existing catholic church 
there will not be a separate church formed this is the most 
effective melting pot in the world all of us are so mixed he 
said we fight for the blackness because it is so oppressed but 
we have so much of the rest of the world in us we can never go our 
separate way

the band around adnan khashoggis right ankle is 
the size of a snazzy rolex watch but its khashoggi who is being 
watched not the time 
khashoggi was released thursday on 10 million bail on condition 
he wear the black band that will keep tabs on his whereabouts 
its not the beall endall panacea but its the hottest 
thing in the business michael mahoney executive director of the 
chicagobased john howard association a prison watchdog group 
said thursday 
khashoggi who is being tried in us district court in 
manhattan is charged with mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
for allegedly helping ferdinand and imelda marcos plunder the 
philippine treasury 
after his release thursday he was driven to an apartment he 
owns in the luxury olympic towers building on fifth avenue 
the duplex apartment featured in house amp garden magazine in 
1984 was carved out of 16 apartments and contains such amenities 
as a swimming pool in a twostory atrium a sauna a 7by10foot 
bed covered in sable marble floors and cartier knickknacks 
khashoggi once one of the worlds richest men submitted 
documents to the court last week indicating a net worth of 538 
million 
the wristlet the brand of bracelet khashoggi wears is around 
his right ankle according to the us marshals office heres how 
it works computerized telephone calls will come randomly into his 
apartment 
a computerized voice will tell him he has 30 or 60 seconds to 
touch his device with a flashlightlike wand attached to the 
telephone according to marc renzema associate professor of 
criminal justice at kutztown university in pennsylvania who knows 
the device 
a code will decide if this is khashoggi he will state his name 
and the conversation will be taped said renzema 
khashoggi is restricted to the courts jurisdiction manhattan 
the bronx and the northern suburbs however the company that 
operates the wristlet said it had not gotten instructions to set up 
another telephone device to monitor the defendant outside his home 
if the signal is lost for a certain period of time it phones 
home and says mr khashoggi or whomever is not home any more send 
out the swat team renzema said 
in 1988 nearly 2300 offenders were using electronic monitoring 
devices in 33 states about three times the number using them a 
year earlier according to department of justice statistics 
this year 5400 offenders in 37 states and puerto rico are 
making their presences known electronically according to renzema 
offenders given the opportunity to use the devices renzema 
said are whitecollar offenders people they are not worried are 
going to rape and kill 
renzema said most of those using the devices are on probation 
an additional 1200 to 1300 are on work furloughs or early release 
who would be charged with escape if they miss a beep 
enthusiasm for the monitoring devices is high and growing 
mahoney said mainly because for the most part it works 
but if a convicted drug dealer is released with a band and gets 
busy racking up sales the device simply answers the question of 
where the inmate is all it means is hes in the home

a governing party elder today took himself out of 
the running to be japans next prime minister strengthening the 
chance that the partys youngest ever secretarygeneral will reach 
the nations highest office 
the scandalplagued liberal democrats formally decided today to 
choose a new leader aug 8 in a vote by the partys members of 
parliament and seek his approval in parliament aug 10 party 
officials said 
the secretarygeneral ryutaro hashimoto is in charge of the 
search for a successor to prime minister sousuke uno who announced 
his resignation to take responsibility for the liberal democrats 
unprecedented defeat in parliamentary elections on sunday 
former deputy prime minister shin kanemaru 75 who had been 
viewed as opposing the 51yearold hashimoto today said he had no 
intention to be prime minister 
speculation centered on hashimoto whose star has been rising 
fast in the conservative party in the past two months while unos 
leadership was cut short by an influencepeddling scandal and 
allegations he paid a geisha for sex 
hashimotos chances were further bolstered when former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa who controls the third largest faction in 
the party also said he preferred to have an young and 
progressive person to head the party and the government 
uno announced his resignation after sunday elections in which 
his party lost control of the 252member upper house of parliament 
for the first time in its 34 years 
the party has a majority in the more powerful lower house of 
parliament which chooses the prime minister 
a party official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
leaders seem to be trying to build consensus within the party 
over hashimoto and i have not heard anyone express strong 
opposition so far 
but he said some party elders insist it is premature for the 
party to give power to such a young politician in such a turbulent 
time 
for decades japans prime ministers have been men in their 
middle 60s or older who reached the office after a serving a series 
of increasingly important cabinet and party posts hashimoto in 
parliament since he was 26 has not held top cabinet posts he rose 
to the no 2 party post in june 
uno was virtually handpicked by former prime minister noboru 
takeshita two months ago after takeshita resigned to take 
responsibility for a widespread influencepeddling scandal that 
touched much of the partys top leadership 
officials of the japan socialist party which seeks to form a 
coalition with three small centrist parties against the governing 
party said it would ask them to support socialist leader takako 
doi in the prime ministerial election in parliament

a county official says people have made 
such a big deal about his reporting of marijuana pollen levels for 
allergy sufferers that he no longer will provide the data 
its just becoming an unduly great issue considering the fact 
the pollen is relatively insignificant in terms of our total 
counts said mark sneller who runs the pima county health 
departments pollen and molddetecting programs 
he said thursday he would include marijuana pollen in the 
catchall category of others 
since the early 1980s the pollen of cannabis sativa or 
marijuana has appeared on the list publicized during the spring 
and summer to warn the allergyprone of high pollen levels 
but in recent years police and public attention has focused on 
the occasionally high marijuana pollen counts around the city 
the growing goes on all the time thats always there its 
been there for 20 years sneller said

retired librarian william bryan cruse 
received two death sentences today for his shooting rampage at two 
shopping plazas that left six people dead and 10 wounded 
circuit judge john antoon sentenced the 61yearold cruse to the 
electric chair in the shooting deaths of two police officers who 
tried to halt the massacre in nearby palm bay a central florida 
coastal city 
antoon added four consecutive sentences of life in prison 
without possibility of parole for at least 25 years in the other 
shooting deaths and three years on 26 other counts for a total of 
103 years parole would be possible only if the death sentences 
were overturned 
cruse dressed in a red jail outfit expressed little reaction 
to the proceedings except he appeared to wipe his eyes at one 
point when a shooting victim read a statement before the judge 
a polk county jury convicted cruse last april 5 on 32 counts of 
murder attempted murder and kidnapping in the april 23 1987 
incident 
besides the police officers those killed were an engineer two 
college students from kuwait and a woman sitting in her car outside 
a store 
in addition to the 10 wounded the jury found that cruse tried 
to kill 14 other people and held two women hostage inside the 
supermarket where he barricaded himself for more than seven hours 
following the shootout 
cruse told investigators after he was captured that he got 
into trouble because everybody believed he was homosexual 
the trial jury rejected arguments from specialists and cruses 
public defenders that he was temporarily insane because of 
delusions brought on by mental illness 
although medical experts for both sides agreed that cruse is 
mentally ill prosecutors argued that under florida law mental 
illness is only one factor in a legal definition of criminal 
insanity 
cruse told investigators after his capture that he was trying 
to get back at people who taunted him he said he was drunk and 
crazy during the shootout 
before the sentencing public defender james russo said he 
believed there was little chance that cruse wouldnt get the death 
sentence 
but he said the frail prisoner might not outlive the states 
lengthy appeal process for death row inmates 
cruse has spent most of the time since his arrest in a 
singleperson cell eating only a sparse diet of fruit and cereal 
his eating habits were the result of his fears that jailers were 
trying to poison him and he has lost considerable weight and 
energy 
the two officers killed were responding to reports of a wild man 
shooting an assault rifle at shoppers and passersby in the parking 
lots of publix and winndixie supermarkets across a busy street 
from each other

mount mckinley still is north americas 
tallest mountain but it is not as tall as people have been saying 
for years 
using extremely sensitive gravity meters and satellites 
scientists from the university of alaskaanchorage have determined 
the mountain is 20306 feet high 
thats 14 feet less than what bradford washburn calculated in 
1954 but it still is 456 feet taller than the runnerup mount 
logan in canada 
i wish it had gone up 14 feet said jeff yates assistant 
coordinator of the project its kind of an intangible thing from 
a climbers standpoint people just like the bigger mountains 
a few more measurements might vary the new measurement slightly 
but not more than a foot yates said 
the scientists say that because of its great mass mckinley 
exerts enough gravitational pull to distort standard surveying 
techniques like those used by washburn to calculate the mountains 
height

bicyclists spent years training 
motorists to share the road in this twowheeler town but now they 
must make room for a brash new fourwheeled rival the skateboard 
the palo alto city council recently approved an ordinance 
authorizing skateboards on all but 25 of the citys busiest streets 
to cyclists who fought for years to develop 45 miles of bicycle 
paths the new law smacks of dashed promises and perilous road 
hazards 
bicycling has taken on major cultural significance in palo alto 
where city employees are reimbursed seven cents per mile for riding 
their bikes to work and some corporations provide showers and even 
free towels for cycling employees 
the police department even offers a bicycle traffic school for 
juveniles 
cyclists reject accusations theyre reluctant to share the road 
with skateboarders and point instead to their brakes lights and 
reflectors claiming to be the superior mode of alternative transit 
in this affluent highlyeducated community 
but skateboarders say they know better 
they think theyre cars bobby angus 13 of menlo park 
said of bicyclists 
they could get out of our way but no we have to get out of 
their way said 14yearold justin aranda 
people think we want to knock over old ladies and its not 
true said 14yearold mark nelson of menlo park straddling his 
bicycle i stop faster on my board than on my bike bikings sort 
of lame 
walter williams 14 dropped his board to the ground to 
demonstrate a power slide stop in which sharp midair 
maneuvering brought the board to an abrupt halt 
many cities simply prohibit skateboard riding 
in san francisco 35 miles north of palo alto skateboarding is 
illegal on all roadways and the sidewalks of any business district 
and has been since 1976 
in sacramento police recently painted skateboards next to the 
graphics of bicycles and roller skates both indicating vehicles 
already prohibited on pathways in capitol park 
even the city of petaluma about 60 miles north of palo alto 
which modified its laws in 1987 to allow skateboarders to use 
public streets still bans skateboarding in shopping centers on 
sidewalks in parks and after dark without reflectors 
but in palo alto city councilman leland levy has hailed the 
skateboard as a terrific mode of transportation because its 
small easy to deal with and you can carry it around with you 
compared to popular multispeed bicycles that sell for hundreds 
and even thousands of dollars skateboards are a cheap way to get 
around at 150 each for topoftheline equipment and they are 
particularly popular with students 
but this does little to endear cyclists to skateboarding 
i dont care if theyre using it for transportation but when 
they start showing off they take up the road said ben brown 
13 of menlo park the ones who get obsessed with it theyre the 
ones who get in your way 
skateboarders have a long way to go before they will come close 
to matching the number of bicyclists and unlike bicyclists they so 
far have no organization to represent them when lobbying the city 
dave uggla of the palo alto bicycle advisory committee formed 
by city council to advise it on issues relating to bicycles 
likened much of the skateboarders current struggle for respect to 
that of cyclists in the early 1970s 
we had a long hard fight to win community awareness he 
said 
and bob noyes an avid cyclist who commutes three miles each way 
to work warned of the downside of respectability 
theres a rough side to it too he said you get moving 
violations just like a car i got two for running stop signs

india today signed an agreement to 
start withdrawing its peacekeeping troops and at least 74 people 
were reported killed in one of the worst days of ethnic violence on 
this island nation 
an indian official said the pullout would begin saturday the 
same day that talks would begin in new delhi to set a timetable for 
the withdrawal 
the troops arrived in sri lanka two years ago and president 
ranasinghe premadasa had ordered them to be out of the country by 
saturday 
we should be grateful to the government of india for agreeing 
to recall the indian army premadasa said in a prepared speech 
for broadcast over television and radio tonight 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi had said a hasty withdrawal 
could lead to more bloodshed on the island where tamil rebels are 
fighting the sinhalesedominated government for a homeland in the 
northeast 
but an indian foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth said the 
two countries signed an agreement in colombo today to begin pulling 
out the estimated 45000 indian troops stationed in the region 
in new delhi the indian government said its troops would begin 
pulling out saturday the government did not say how many soldiers 
were to leave or when the withdrawal is to be completed 
a sri lanaka foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said a sevenmember sri lankan delegation headed by 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne would fly to new delhi saturday 
to start discussing a timetable 
on thursday wijeratne demanded that before he would travel to 
new delhi india also would have to accept premadasa as 
commanderinchief of all forces in sri lanka and honor a 
ceasefire with the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest 
and the most militant rebel group but seth said wijeratne will 
discuss those two conditions when the minister travels to new delhi 
sri lankas government clamped a nationwide curfew at midnight 
thursday and posted soldiers and heavily armed policemen in all 
major cities the curfew was extended this evening until 6 am 
sunday 
despite the curfew staterun television said at least 74 people 
were killed in ethnic violence and nearly all of the deaths 
occurred in the sinhalese heartland where extremists oppose 
limited autonomy the government has offered to the tamils and want 
all the indian troops out immediately 
sri lankan television said most of those who died were killed by 
sri lankan forces in areas where the indians do not operate no 
other details on the killings were immediately available 
indian troops initially were deployed to supervise the july 29 
1987 accord that promised limited selfrule to sri lankas 
minority tamils 
in exchange militant tamils had to agree to surrender their 
weapons while most militias abided by the accord he tamil tigers 
backed out and began attacking indian soldiers about 1000 troops 
have died 
after the tamil tigers opened peace talks with the sri lankan 
government on june 1 premadasa demanded that indian troops 
withdraw his repeated calls for the withdrawal and gandhis 
refusals led to fears of an armed confrontation between indian and 
sri lankan troops 
however wijeratne ruled out a military clash with the powerful 
neighbor in the northeast saying we know our limitations 
sri lankas army has about 40000 troops 
a leader of the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front a 
tamil party that fears genocidal by the tamil tigers once the 
indian soldiers leave said his party can mobilize 10000 
cadres 
but the figure given by ira kuganeswaran a member of 
parliament is believed by observers to be highly inflated 
kuganeswaran spoke by telephone from vavuniya 135 miles northeast 
of colombo

the soviet union has proposed that the japanese 
provide technology for a joint project to develop a space aircraft 
japanese officials said friday 
the proposals were made tuesday when six soviet officials 
visited japans national space development agency an agency 
official said 
the delegates said the soviet union is ready to provide japan 
with technology to manufacture the energia rocket the worlds 
largest rocket that is capable of launching an 18ton payload or 
export to japan a rocket that can lift a twoton payload said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the smaller rocket is priced at about 30 million according to 
the major economic daily nihon keizai shimbun 
we were just amazed at the soviet proposals the agency 
official said 
he said a soviet delegation visited the governmentfinanced 
organization handling japans space development and rocket 
launching but never made such businessoriented proposals 
the latest soviet offer is considered aimed at obtainining 
foreign currency under president mikhail s gorbachevs program of 
social and economic reforms the official said 
an official of the science and technology agency who also would 
not allow his name to be used said the soviet delegates visited 
his agency july 17 but put forth no concrete terms regarding joint 
projects 
japan plans to develop an unmanned spacecraft in the next decade 
and eventually wants to send its own astronauts into space aboard 
japanesemade vessels 
last month the space development commission japans highest 
government organ supervising japanese aerospace programs announced 
a 10year plan that included development of the nextgeneration h2 
rocket capable of lifting a twoton payload 
to date japan has had 19 successful launches with its n and 
hseries rockets each of them carrying up to 1200 pounds 
it has yet to test a twostage liquid combustion engine to be 
used in the h2 rocket scheduled to be launched in 1993 
the soviet delegates who came for the opening of a design 
exposition also met july 18 with officials of the society of 
japanese aircraft contractors a group of 180 japanese companies 
engaged in spacerelated products manufacturing 
western observers say it will not be long until japan ventures 
into the commercial arena to compete in space technology just as it 
has in the automobile computer and electronics markets

flight attendants from united flight 232 today 
described the horror of the dc10s fiery crash in sioux city 
iowa last week and the joy at finding so many survivors 
it was a rollercoaster ride with special effects said 
flight attendant timothy owens who was seated in the middle of the 
plane when it went down 
he was one of five of the eight chicagobased crew members who 
were aboard the plane when it crashed july 19 who appeared at a 
news conference this morning sponsored by their union the 
association of flight attendants 
seven of the eight were among the 185 survivors of the crash 
association spokeswoman cindy yeast said the news conference was 
an opportunity for the flight attendants to tell how they were 
involved in the crash that killed 111 people 
most who spoke were tearyeyed and choked up as they described 
the terror of the crash 
the first time we hit we bounced and i had my eyes open 
owens said i saw overhead bins and coils and wires from the 
ceiling after that thats when the tail section of the plane 
just split apart and i saw a big beam of sunlight just coming 
through the big opening in the back and thats when we started to 
roll over on the right wing 
donna mcgrady one of the flight attendants said she had her 
eyes open as the plane crashlanded 
i said oh god the important thing that i thought 
about was whens it going to stop 
mcgrady remained belted in her seat as the dc10s tail section 
where she was located split off from the rest of the plane and 
came to rest 
at that particular time to come out and to look and to see 
nothing but debris she said her voice breaking i said 
oh god where is the other part of the aircraft 
many of the at least 75 united employees in the audience at the 
news conference dabbed at tears as mcgrady told of the aftermath of 
the crash and her happiness at seeing survivors emerge 
i said thank you jesus for the things that youve done for 
us because we know theres no other way we could have made it 
without your presence she said 
the head flight attendant on the plane janice brown said she 
could not think of anything the flight attendants could have done 
to save more people and could not explain why those who survived 
did while others died 
im not going to secondguess god brown said 
the crowd at a ballroom at ohare international airport gave a 
standing ovation to the five flight attendants from flight 232 as 
well as three of their colleagues who assisted on the ground one 
crew member and a flight attendant who was on board the plane but 
not on duty at the time remain hospitalized the eighth member of

skeletal remains believed to be 
those of a british soldier killed in a world war i battle were 
stolen from a museum by a dutch veteran who says hes seeking an 
honorable burial for the man 
draped in a vintage british military coat and posed in a trench 
mockup the skull and left leg bones formed the centerpiece of the 
somme museum the private collection of war memorabilia is devoted 
to the 1916 battle by the same name that killed more than 1 million 
british french and german soldiers 
john bluming who served in the dutch contingent in the korean 
war said in a telephone interview friday that he walked into the 
museum tuesday wrapped the remains in a union jack and spirited 
them away for eventual burial with military honors 
it isnt right for some imbecile to charge money just so you 
can see the remains of a dead soldier said bluming who added he 
had handed the bones over to a former british commando for transfer 
to the british authorities he refused to identify the commando 
the episode has pitted the frenchborn owner of the somme museum 
against the british embassy the british commonwealth war graves 
commission and others who thought the exhibit was in just plain bad 
taste 
museum owner sembeau lecocq said he found the skull and bones in 
a trench near the village of thiepval in the somme district about 
25 years ago and decided to take them home for use in the exhibit 
housed in a castle in this northern dutch town 
lecocq said he dubbed the bones soldier john because he had 
found some british uniform buttons nearby and assumed the remains 
to be those of a british soldier 
surrounded by stuffed rats rusty rifles and dented helmets 
soldier john became part of a trench exhibit meant to underline 
the hardships endured by soldiers in world war i 
earlier this month the newspaper de telegraaf published an 
article about the museum including a picture of the bones of 
soldier john 
bluming said that spurred him to action because the bones just 
didnt belong in the museum 
bluming said he had taken the law into his own hands as a 
gesture of gratitude to the british for their part in the 
liberation of the netherlands from nazi occupation in 1945 
but he added id have done the same thing for a german 
british embassy spokesman brian bennett said the commonwealth 
war graves commission had been negotiating for permission to bury 
the remains since 1985 but added an initial deal with lecocq had 
fallen through 
the commission based in the belgian city of ypres looks after 
the graves of british australian canadian and other commonwealth 
soldiers buried in europe after both world wars 
its most unfortunate bennett said we would like to take 
possession of the remains and give them an honorable burial near 
the northern french site where they were found 
he added such a funeral would require permission from the dutch 
government and that the remains had not been handed over to the 
embassy 
the netherlands was neutral in world war i but there are dozens 
of exhibits like the somme museum in belgium and france those 
include the verdun ossuary near that northeastern french city 
where hundreds of thousands of bones are on display

a breeze of change has begun to blow through the 
imperial palace since emperor akihito took the throne but change 
doesnt come easily to a 1200yearold monarchy 
to most of the nation akihito remains a distant figure seen 
only through the bits of news gathered by a small group of 
reporters who cover the daily activities of the royal family from 
offices behind the tokyo palaces moat and high stone walls 
that news however has portrayed the man on the chrysanthemum 
throne in a softer more personable light than his enigmatic 
father hirohito who died jan 7 
he is a more democratic person than his father was because 
they were raised in a different era said one palace reporter 
who has covered both emperors he really wants to get out among 
the people and has surprised some attendants by suddenly changing 
his schedule to do so 
such comparisons between hirohito who was revered as a god 
until the end of world war ii and akihito the first emperor to 
assume the throne not as a deity but as a man have dominated 
akihitos sevenmonth reign 
on his first trip away from the capital akihito used a less 
regal form of speech than his father when addressing a crowd and 
insisted on fewer uniformed guards along procession routes though 
more plainclothes police were deployed 
the 55yearold emperor reportedly even asked for the removal of 
a curtain separating himself and empress michiko from other 
passengers on a chartered flight to the treeplanting festival in 
late may 
i think its fine the imperial household must adapt to 
historical developments said prince mikasa akihitos uncle and 
the oldest male member of the imperial family the 74yearold 
spoke in a rare interview with the yomiuri shimbun japans largest 
newspaper 
akihito shocked traditionalists in 1959 while still crown 
prince when he married a commoner a union warmly welcomed by the 
japanese public 
the royal couple then broke with the past by raising their two 
sons and daughter by themselves akihito was sent off to be reared 
by chamberlains at the age of 3 
more changes were expected after the death of hirohito 87 
whose 62year reign covered a tumultuous period of history many 
japanese still struggle to understand 
during his reign the longest in japanese history japan waged 
a disastrous war in asia suffered a humiliating defeat against the 
allies in 1945 and rose from the ashes of its bombedout cities to 
become a modern economic superpower 
his death was the end of an era but it remains difficult for 
akihito to make major changes in an institution that can trace its 
roots back to at least the 8th century and by legend to emperor 
jimmu in 660 bc 
akihitos first news conference open to 50 selected foreign and 
japanese reporters is scheduled for aug 4 seven months after he 
became emperor it is likely to be as formal as those his father 
used to hold 
like hirohito who met with the foreign and japanese news media 
in several such encounters akihito will answer only a set of 
questions submitted in advance and negotiated with palace officials 
for several weeks 
the meeting is expected to last less than an hour and cover 
questions such as those hirohito accepted from reporters the war 
his role in modern japan palace life whether things are likely to 
change 
a a handful of chamberlains personal doctors nurses and 
ritualists continues to surround the emperor 
most of hirohitos chamberlains continue to carry out palace 
duties of some sort and disagreements between the akihito and 
hirohito camps are not uncommon the palace reporter said 
requesting that he not be identified by name 
the chamberlains themselves often descended from nobility or 
illustrious families are known to oppose innovation even by 
younger chamberlains as many see themselves as the protectors of 
tradition 
it will take at least 10 years for the new emperor to come 
into his own the reporter said 
little change is expected in the daily rituals carried out at 
three shrines on the palaces wooded grounds 
ritualists dressed in traditional robes and headwear present 
offerings of food and wine at the shrines dedicated to the gods 
in general the imperial ancestors and the sun goddess amaterasu 
from whom japans royal line is said to have descended 
hirohito renounced his divinity as a false concept at the 
urging of the usled occupation forces in 1946 and a new 
constitution omitting passages stating that the emperor had a 
special relationship to the gods was drafted in 1947 
the 1947 constitution also put an end to state backing of 
shinto japans indigenous religion which had been transformed 
from a kind of nature worship into an emperorcentered form of 
nationalism by a military government seeking to fuel its war 
machine 
but just before hirohitos death senior ritualist toshinobu 
maeda said the renunciation of divinity did not affect palace 
rites and neither would akihitos accession 
since the revised constitution took effect the ritualists have 
been the private employees of the emperor instead of being in 
government pay 
fear of stirring up the statereligion controversy has delayed a 
government announcement of where another rite the daijosai will 
be held 
during that mystical ceremony which will be held in november 
1990 the emperor traditionally has had his first communion with 
amaterasu and then be reborn a god news reports have said staging 
the complex daijosai could cost as much as 70 million 
tokyo has apparently been chosen for security reasons but 
officials refuse to publicly rule out kyoto the ancient capital in 
western japan where the imperial family resided for more than a 
millenium

us industry could be encouraged to invest in 
space research if the federal government would allow companies a 
decade of taxfree income from products developed in orbit rep 
robert s walker suggested friday 
walker ranking republican on the house science space and 
technology committee said that such a tax incentive would be one 
way for the united states to maintain world leadership in space 
during an era when the federal budget may be unable to finance such 
research 
if you told manufacturers that if you develop a product in 
space and bring it back to earth and sell it then you can market 
it for 10 years tax free it would encourage industry to invest in 
space research walker said at a breakfast for reporters 
it would cost us the federal government absolutely nothing 
to give this kind of incentive because there currently are no 
such products being made and sold the pennsylvania republican said 
walker said the tax incentive is one way for the nation to 
encourage the development of research and manufacturing in space 
without the government having to finance all of the effort 
he said there already are ideas that could be researched in 
orbit but companies are reluctant to make the high investment 
required for instance said walker a firm in pennsylvania has 
proposed a plan to grown human nerve tissue in orbit and then 
return it earth where it could be transplanted into humans with 
optic nerve blindness 
walker said the nerve tissue cannot be grown on earth because 
gravity distorts the cell structure but in the weightlessness of 
orbit this is not a problem 
industry he said also could be encouraged to develop new 
booster rockets if the government particularly the military would 
assure manufacturers that commercial launch services would be used 
to put nasa and air force satellites into orbit 
such assurances said walker could lead to the commercial 
development of what he called a big dumb booster a simple 
but powerful rocket built with current technology that could put 
large satellites into orbit routinely 
he said that instead of encouraging the commercial production of 
simple big dumb booster rockets the military and nasa are 
attempting to persuade congress to finance new generations of 
rockets that would require governmentfinanced development

president victor paz estenssoro is to 
step down on aug 6 but there is no leader waiting in the wings to 
assume control of this impoverished nation of 69 million people 
no party won an absolute majority in may 7 elections and the top 
three votegetters have been unable to choose the next president 
uncertainty over who will be bolivias 77th president has raised 
political and economic tensions in this impoverished nation of 69 
million 
in may voters chose among nine presidential candidates 
gonzalo sanchez de lozada candidate for the governing 
revolutionary nationalist movement won a relative majority with 24 
percent of the vote former military dictator gen hugo banzer 
suarez of the conservative nationalist democratic action party 
trailed sanchez de lozada by just 1 percent and jaime paz zamora of 
the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left won 19 
percent of the vote 
according to the constitution the president must be elected 
from the top three parties by a new congress chosen according to 
the percentage of popular votes each party received 
a presidential candidate must receive 79 congressional votes to 
be elected sanchez de lozada partys has 49 banzers party has 46 
and paz zamoras party 41 
the new congress is scheduled to meet aug 4 and should elect a 
president in time for the aug 6 inauguration but three leading 
candidates have been unable to form an alliance to provide 
sufficient congressional votes to elect a president 
earlier this week roman catholic bishops mediated negotiations 
between banzer sanchez de lozada and paz zamora and the three 
candidates signed a declaration promising congress will choose a 
new president by aug 6 
in recent weeks paz zamoras leftofcenter party negotiated 
its support for banzer in return for the presidency of congress and 
regional development corporations leaders in zamoras party 
however broke ranks and refused to support banzer who persecuted 
them during his 1971 to 1978 dictatorship 
sanchez de lozada 59 offered paz zamora a major role in the 
government in exchange for his support sanchez de lozada also said 
that his party would back paz zamora for president after his four 
year term ended 
paz zamora 50 has not yet responded to sanchez de lozadas 
proposal 
business leaders have asked the three candidates to resolve 
their differences out of concern for the conflicts impact on the 
economy 
banks have frozen the disbursement of loans and businesses 
report a slowdown in the economy in response to the political 
crisis citizens have also pulled millions of dollars in deposits 
from banks 
despite an uncertainty over who will be the next president 
however the government has managed to keep a lid on inflation and 
maintain the confidence of foreign governments and lending 
organizations inflation since january is running at 5 percent one 
of the lowest rates in south america 
the us government also granted bolivia a 100 million loan to 
shore up the economy 
the three candidates have said that if elected president they 
will maintain the basic elements of the governments free market 
economic program which managed to halt 24000 percent inflation in 
1985 
the economy is expected to expand by at least 3 percent this 
year the first real growth in more than a decade 
after presidential elections in 1979 and 1980 a similar 
stalemate resulted in bloody military coups 
today however the military high command is supportive of the 
democratic process and there are no rumblings from the barracks 
the aug 6 swearingin would be the first time in 25 years that 
a civilian president has completed his term and turned over the 
presidency to a democratically elected government

warring syrian and christian forces 
battered beirut with 50000 shells and rockets overnight killing 
13 people in a random bombardment that one radio station called a 
night of insane terror 
the eighthour barrage sparked fires that raged out of control 
and gutted scores of warehouses shops and apartment buildings 
orange flames blazed against the night sky as residents cowered 
in basements and bomb shelters 
almost every neighborhood in the divided capital and the 
christian port city of jounieh were hit as if by a killer 
earthquake said a police spokesman it was beiruts night of 
horror and terror 
he said 13 people were killed and 65 wounded raising the toll 
to 494 dead and 2014 injured since the latest fighting erupted 
march 8 between lebanese army commander michel aouns mainly 
christian troops and an alliance of the syrian army and druse 
moslem militiamen 
it was the heaviest shelling duel in the fourmonth 
confrontation in terms of firepower used and destruction 
wreaked said the police spokesman 
syrian gunners in west beirut and north lebanon joined forces at 
8 pm thursday and started blasting jounieh east beirut and the 
christian port of byblos he said 
aouns forces struck back at syrian batteries with 155mm 
howitzers but their allies from the lebanese forces militia fired 
an indiscriminate barrage at west beirut the shelling tapered off 
at 4 am 
people emerged from bunkers and jammed supermarkets buying food 
and bottled water in anticipation of another bombardment 
is this apocalypse asked hisham sinno a sunni moslem 
grocer whose shop was destroyed im destroyed i have no source 
of income left 
let them all roast in hell those who are roasting beirut 
said albert tawil a christian bank employee in east beirut i 
wish one day ill drink their blood 
broken power cables dangled on streets littered with craters and 
glass shards hundreds of burnedout cars smoldered 
an electric tools warehouse in west beirut burned from midight 
to midday fire engines wre unable to battle the fire because of a 
water shortage 
a night of insane terror the moslemcontrolled voice of the 
nation radio said of the thunderous duel waged with multibarreled 
launchers that spit 40 rockets a minute 
were being killed in our beds beirut is being massacred 
and no one in the arab world or the outside world seems to care 
said an announcer on christianrun voice of lebanon his voice 
choking with emotion 
one rocket devastated the top floor of the sevenstory building 
housing offices of the associated press and the us television 
networks cbs and nbc 
the explosion blew me out of my bed i found myself flat on 
the floor with glass shards showering me said ap correspondent 
farouk nassar who lives on the sixth floor 
the blast shattered windows and hurled pieces of furniture down 
the street 
screams for help rang out as one rocket tore through the second 
floor of a nearby apartment building chopping off the left leg of 
druse janitor jawhar aljawhari 38 he was taken to the american 
university hospital where dozens of stretchers with screaming 
wounded crowded the emergency ward 
the un headquarters in west beirut and the soviet embassy 
compound also took direct hits but police said no casualties were 
reported 
another exodus followed the bombardment police estimated at 
least 100000 residents fled beirut on thursday and friday in 
addition to a quartermillion last weekend the citys population 
of 15 million has been halved since march 
the international committee of the red cross issued an urgent 
appeal to all warring factions for an immediate cessation of 
indiscriminate bombardment of civil properties and population 
which constitutes an unacceptable violation to the simplest 
humanitarian norms 
the spiraling violence underscores the lack of progress made by 
an arab league committee appointed in may to help end lebanons 
14year civil war 
this latest confrontation erupted after aoun blockaded illegal 
harbors run by moslem militias aiming to restore eroded state 
authority and recoup 100 million a year in lost tax revenues 
druse warlord walid jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 
christian enclave north of beirut where aouns 20000 troops are 
stationed 
the syrians who maintain 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league later joined the 
shelling and enforced a sea and land blockade around the enclave

rep tommy robinson of arkansas complaining 
there is no room for conservative southerners in the national 
democratic party announced today he is switching to the republican 
party 
robinson a thirdterm congressman made the announcement at a 
white house briefing where president bush welcomed him to the gop 
as a man of the people who believes in a strong defense and 
traditional american values 
robinson became the third democratic official in three days to 
switch to the republican party and the second house democrat to 
join the gop this year rep bill grant of florida made the switch 
in february 
robinsons defection leaves the party lineup in the house at 256 
democrats and 176 republicans with three vacancies 
even after losing five of the last six presidential elections 
in the nation and arkansas the leadership of the democratic party 
still is unwilling to listen to the majority of the american 
people robinson said 
i simply cannot wait any longer for the liberal leadership 
of the democratic party to see the light he said the hard 
fact is that there is and will be no room for conservative southern 
democrats in todays national democratic party 
on thursday retiring district of columbia police chief maurice 
turner made a similar announcement turner who is considered a 
mayoral prospect for the capital city was welcomed to the 
republican party in a meeting with bush and lee atwater chairman 
of the republican national committee 
on wednesday louisiana secretary of state fox mckeithen shed 
the democratic affiliation carried for a lifetime by his father 
eightyear former gov john mckeithen 
bush called the younger mckeithen and told him yours was a 
courageous decision mckeithen who is considering a bid next 
year against democratic sen bennett johnston said his father told 
him you must be crazy 
a former sheriff robinson was elected to the house in 1984 from 
arkansas 2nd congressional district he has a conservative strong 
prodefense record and serves on the house armed services veterans 
affairs and aging committees 
robinsons switch brings to 130 the number of party converts at 
all levels mostly state and local officials announced by the 
republicans in their bid to realign the voter registration patterns 
the number takes in party and elected officials and some no 
longer in office down to the level of local clerk alderman local 
committee member and school board member the rnc did not provide 
dates for many of the changes but the dates that were given were 
for this year 
all the party switchers were from southern states 
robinson was in the news earlier this year for giving a 
60000ayear job on his congressional staff to the 22yearold 
daughter of his close friend business partner and financial 
backer dallas cowboys owner jerry jones 
robinson reported owing at least 100000 to jones 
although not illegal the hiring of jones daughter raised 
questions because other capitol hill aides at her level just out 
of college earn far less and hold jobs less elevated than her 
trio of titles administrative assistant office manager and press 
secretary

president bush said today that william lucas 
his embattled nominee to head the justice departments civil rights 
division has my confidence and had been personally assured of 
his support 
fielding questions from reporters bush ascribed mounting 
criticism of lucas qualifications to pure gut politics and 
said he thought lucas was paying a political price for switching 
from the democratic to the republican party 
lucas a former public official in the detroit area has denied 
a new but unverified allegation that he once complained about a 
federal housing discrimination suit against a predominantly white 
detroit suburb 
justice department spokesman david runkel said late thursday 
that lucas nominated as assistant attorney general for civil 
rights denied urging the government to drop a housing 
discrimination suit against the city of birmingham mich 
the allegation was contained in a letter to the senate judiciary 
committee from michael sussman a former justice department civil 
rights lawyer who now represents black plaintiffs in the landmark 
desegregation case against yonkers ny 
bush appearing in the white house briefing room today said 
i strongly support bill lucas im strongly convinced that much 
not all of but much of the criticism of him is pure gut politics 
and it started before day one of the confirmation hearings 
he has my confidence the president said but let the 
record show i made phone calls for him i told bill last 
night i am staying with you a hundred percent and its going to 
be right there and solid 
bush had been asked whether he thought he had spoken up 
sufficiently forcefully for his justice department nominee 
runkel the department spokesman called sussman a disgruntled 
former employee of the department and said of the latest 
allegation this kind of a lastminute tactic is reprehensible 
from somebody who is certainly aware of the system to raise an 
issue without any substance at all at this point 
civil rights organizations have questioned lucas qualifications 
to serve in the post the 61yearold black republican from detroit 
was sheriff and later chief executive of wayne county mich he is 
a lawyer who has never appeared in court 
sussmans letter describing a 1980 telephone call by lucas was 
circulated thursday by congressional sources after the judiciary 
committee postponed a vote on the nomination until tuesday at the 
request of sen howell heflin dala 
heflin whose vote could decide whether the panel gives lucas a 
favorable recommendation to the full senate said he wanted time to 
study the new information 
i dont want to injure anybody the allegations are not 
substantiated heflin told reporters 
lawmakers lobbyists and justice department officials professed 
ignorance about the new information to which heflin referred the 
alabama senator told colleagues he would not necessarily support 
lucas if forced to vote thursday 
in the letter circulated later in the day sussman said he was 
not personally the recipient of mr lucas call but i distinctly 
recall discussing it with my supervisor 
it particularly struck me that mr lucas who then was 
sheriff of wayne county and a political figure familiar to me from 
my frequent visits to the area would attempt to intervene on 
behalf of the defendant white officeholders sussman said 
the justice department which eventually won the suit charged 
that the city of birmingham violated the fair housing act by 
preventing the construction of racially integrated lowincome 
housing birmingham is in oakland county 
runkel said the lawyer who tried the case brian heffernan 
never heard of lucas until his nomination this year 
but sussman reached by telephone at his home in suburban new 
york said he clearly remembers a conversation with his supervisor 
joel selig after lucas telephoned the department three to four 
weeks after the lawsuit was first filed 
sussman said selig told him that lucas was one of several 
callers who complained about the suit being filed the calls were 
a vindication of his seligs arguments that the case would 
generate a lot of heat sussman said 
selig who teaches at the university of wyoming law school said 
from his home in laramie that he doesnt recall a telephone call 
from lucas 
but it is entirely possible that such a contact occurred and 
that i simply do not remember it because i attached no particular 
significance to it at the time he said 
selig said he was contacted about the allegation several weeks 
ago by someone investigating lucas for an organization selig said 
he spoke with the person whom he refused to identify and lucas on 
a conference telephone call

an archaeological team from the university 
of colorado excavating an ancient indian village in el salvador has 
discovered what specialists think are the oldest known remains of a 
mayan manuscript 
the fragmented remains of what appears to be a codex 
precolumbian written records were found on an adobe shelf in a 
house buried by a volcanic eruption 1400 years ago 
only three other mayan codices are known to have survived the 
destruction of the spanish conquest the origin of a fourth remains 
in dispute among scholars most codices were religious records 
dealing with the astronomical complexities of the mayan calendar 
if the fragments prove to be remains of a mayan codex it would 
be not only the oldest such manuscript but also the only one ever 
discovered in an archaeological excavation said dr payson sheets 
director of the dig and a professor of anthropology at cuboulder 
the joya de ceren site on the edge of a small farming village 
about 16 miles north west of san salvador the capital was buried 
under 15 feet of powdery volcanic ash during the eruption of nearby 
laguna caldera in the year 600 during the midclassic period of 
precolumbian culture 
the site probably contains the best preserved precolumbian 
houses and organic remains in central america sheets said 
the finegrained ash packed tightly around organic material 
giving a level of preservation rarely encountered in archaeology 
before finding the codex sheets team found wooden poles 
carbonized roof thatch wellpreserved beans in a pot and intact 
leaves 
rae beaubien a smithsonian institution preservation specialist 
flew to el salvador last week to examine the codex it is in 
extremely poor condition consisting of ordered layers of paint 
flecks embedded in a block of volcanic ash the paint probably once 
covered pages of pounded bark parchments long since deteriorated 
said beaubien 
she said the find is extremely valuable and even if none of 
the writings are legible scientists will analyze the types of 
paint used and the components of the white background coating that 
covered the parchment 
beaubien will transport the ash block containing the codex to 
smithsonian institution laboratories in washington for further 
excavation and analysis 
the oldest known codex prior to this find is dated at ad 
9001000 
most archaeological research in central america has focused on 
stone palaces and ceremonial centers that survived intact 
as a result said sheets we know a lot about how the 
upper classes lived but here at ceren the unusual level of 
preservation provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to learn 
about the lives of the lower and middle classes 
the ceren site was discovered during a government construction 
project in 1976 and partially excavated by sheets in 1980 but that 
work was suspended for nine years because of the central american 
nations civil war 
the current excavation began may 25 and will last through aug 
12 the work is financed by a 90000 grant from the national 
science foundation 
in the first house excavated the team has identified womens 
work areas for cooking pottery and clothmaking chipped obsidian 
tools were made most likely by men on a nearby thatchroofed clay 
platform about 30 ceramic vessels several intact have been been 
found 
the scientists used groundpenetrating radar and measurements of 
electrical resistance in the ground to find two more underground 
structures that also are being excavated this summer

president bush said today he is depending on 
the democratic chairman of the armed services committee to help 
prevent congress from gutting a defense authorization bill already 
torn asunder in house votes 
in two days of votes on a 295 billion defense authorization 
bill the house ignored white house and pentagon lobbying and 
turned bushs defense priorities on their head 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the armed services 
committee said the house had shredded bushs defense 
priorities to produce a michael dukakis defense bill 
bush told a white house news conference he is disappointed at 
the house votes cutting back virtually every major strategic 
program but said that with the help of the senate we will 
prevail 
im going to put a lot of emphasis on the senate and we will 
work with people like chairman aspin who does not want to see the 
defense bill gutted bush said 
and i do think we will prevail for most of what we want a 
strong sdi star wars program a strong b2 stealth bomber 
program he said 
but i do not want to negotiate with the soviet union without 
as many cards in my hands as possible he said 
bush said defense secretary dick cheney had made tough cuts in 
defense programs even before the house acted 
i want to get support across the board in the congress for our 
defense program and yesterday was not the houses most memorable 
moment but were going to keep fighting on for what we believe 
in he said 
the house restored funds for conventional aircraft discarded by 
the pentagon while suspending most production of the radarevading 
stealth bomber it cut money for the star wars missile defense 
system stripped funds intended to make the mx missile a mobile 
weapon and eliminated all of the 100 million provided for the 
midgetman missile 
the senate meanwhile only narrowly turned aside a strong bid 
to freeze research and development of the star wars strategic 
defense initiative it tabled the amendment offered by sen bennett 
johnston dla 5047 
but that action may result in the chamber retaining needed 
leverage to resist house cuts on that and other weapons systems 
the senate will need all the leverage it can muster when 
representatives of the two bodies meet in conference to resolve the 
many differences between the two bills 
senators are to continue their consideration of the measure next 
week 
we are watching the strategic position of the administration 
unwind step by step on the floor of the house said sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee 
it is important that we not emasculate this program nunn 
said as the vote neared on an amendment to cut star wars by 558 
million in addition to the 400 million trimmed earlier by the 
senate panel 
if the senate does not come out with a reasonable budget on 
all strategic programs then we are going to be going to conference 
in a hopeless situation he said 
the house adopted its version of the bill 261162 
in the final minutes of debate an unusual coalition of 
republicans and liberals turned against the midgetman 
republicans were prompted by anger at an earlier vote cutting 
502 million from the 11 billion the administration had asked for 
the rail lines needed to make the mx a mobile and less vulnerable 
weapon joining them were many liberal members 
aspin appealed to members not to reject minuteman on a motion 
of spite 
but on a headcount vote of 17690 the house approved the 
change removing all the money for the singlewarhead missile 
the house also revived money for the navys f14d jet fighter 
and the marine corps v22 osprey vertical takeoff assault 
transport two programs bush planned to eliminate as low priority 
items in a tightmoney budget 
summing up the result aspin told reporters that in effect 
mike dukakis won the election no midgetman no rail mx big 
cuts in sdi and slow up the b2 stealth bomber 
dukakis the democratic governor of massachusetts was soundly 
defeated by bush in the 1988 presidential election after a campaign 
in which the republican portrayed the democrat as weak on defense 
as aspin saw it the democratic majority which controls the 
house carried out the defeated candidates campaign promises in 
writing its version of the defense bill 
the houses military spending plan suspends production of the 
b2 stealth bomber priced at about 530 million each until the 
pentagon scales back its 70 billion 132plane program widely 
viewed as unaffordable in an era of soaring budget deficits 
the bill also requires the administration to show that the 
stealth can successfully evade radar detection and penetrate soviet 
airspace before production resumes 
bush and defense secretary dick cheney had lobbied hard for 
stealth star wars and the other strategic programs 
but the house slashed 18 billion from the presidents 49 
billion star wars request

a soviet deputy prime minister said friday she 
ordered 50 million pairs of pantyhose and 17 million pairs of 
womens shoes on a 165 million shopping spree to replenish her 
countrys shelves 
alexandra biryukova the soviet unions topranking woman 
politician then topped off a weeklong trip with a visit to marks 
amp spencer the department store chain favored by prime minister 
margaret thatcher and millions of budgetconscious britons 
mrs biryukova who met mrs thatcher earlier in the week is 
leading a delegation of five ministers to promote sovietbritish 
trade 
she said the group had visited more than 20 firms since arriving 
monday reached agreements on joint ventures and ordered goods from 
coffee and toothpaste to the pantyhose and shoes 
we assess our visit to this country as very useful and 
effective said the deputy prime minister who is in charge of 
social development and joined the ruling communist party politburo 
as a nonvoting member last autumn 
she and the accompanying ministers said their purchases were 
influenced by shortages and were to be delivered by the end of 
this year 
although the soviet government had postponed a revision of the 
pricing system after discovering it would be harder to undertake 
than first imagined it was trying out emergency measures to 
replenish stores mrs biryukova said 
we realize the problem of saturating our market with consumer 
goods is something which has to be addressed very closely she 
said 
along with 110 million in pantyhose shoes coffee toothpaste 
razor blades cassette tapes soap womens clothing and other 
goods the soviets said they purchased 55 million in various 
drugs they did not give specific values for other goods 
the 60yearold deputy prime minister who began her career in a 
calico mill also did not give details of joint ventures soviet 
embassy officials did not return telephone calls and british 
officials said they didnt know details 
mrs biryukova described her meeting wednesday with mrs 
thatcher as friendly and constructive saying they had 
discussed the two nations trade target set last year 
the countries agreed to try to raise the volume of their trade 
to 41 billion by 1990 but mrs biryukova said they hoped to hit 
the target this year 
the confederation of british industry which invited the 
soviets said britain exported 925 million in goods to the soviets 
last year 
the soviets exported 12 billion in goods including oil 
timber and minerals to britain according to the industrial

sales floor a training class and the staff restaurant where she 
drank a cup of tea said director nigel colne

how we go about providing it he said she asked a number of 
questions about how ideas are generated in the business

personal incomes rose a lackluster 03 percent 
in june as consumer spending after adjusting for inflation 
declined for a second straight month the government said friday in 
a report that renewed recession fears 
the commerce department said consumer spending after taking 
inflation into account edged down 01 percent in june following a 
02 percent may decline it marked the first backtoback monthly 
declines in spending since september and october 1987 a period 
when consumer confidence was shaken by the stock market crash 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of overall 
economic activity has been the driving force behind the record 
peacetime expansion now in its seventh year but economists are 
fearful that consumers worried about their economic prospects 
could begin to cut back sharply on their purchases 
the commerce department report said that personal incomes grew a 
modest 03 percent in june following an even smaller 02 percent 
may increase the gains were the weakest this year and reflected in 
part a slowdown in job growth which has sent the unemployment rate 
edging upward 
the economy here at midyear is beginning to flirt with a 
recession said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
we are seeing consumers spending power being squeezed by higher 
inflation at the same time that pentup demand for bigticket items 
is pretty much exhausted 
the government reported thursday that the overall economy as 
measured by the gross national product expanded at a sluggish 
annual rate of 17 percent in the apriljune quarter the slowest 
pace in almost three years 
the bush administration insists that growth will rebound in the 
second half of the year fueled by lower interest rates engineered 
by the federal reserve 
but sinai said he believes the sluggish growth will intensify 
leading to rising unemployment in coming months and further 
weakening consumer confidence he predicted the economy would enter 
a mild recession either late this year or early in 1990 
david jones chief economist with aubrey g lanston amp co said 
he felt the country would be able to skirt through this period of 
sluggish growth without a fullfledged downturn helped in large 
part by further moves by the fed to lower interest rates 
the central bank earlier this week acted for the third time 
since june to ease credit jones said the rapid pacing of these 
interestlowering moves demonstrated how worried the fed is about a 
possible recession 
the fed is concerned that some interestrate sensitive sectors 
of the economy such as autos and housing are still quite weak 
jones said this will lead to further easing on the feds part in 
august 
before adjusting for inflation consumer spending was unchanged 
at an annual rate of 344 trillion in june following a modest 03 
percent may increase 
the key income category of wages and salaries was up 05 percent 
in june but this was in part a bounceback after wage income was 
essentially unchanged in may 
farmers incomes plunged at an annual rate of 12 billion in 
june following a 14 billion may decrease the weakness in june 
reflected a drop in federal subsidy payments 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods items expected 
to last three or more years fell by 17 billion following a 96 
billion decrease in may with much of the weakness in both months 
reflecting a slump in car sales 
purchases of nondurable goods edged up 400 million following a 
much bigger 49 billion rise in may an advance that had been 
propelled by higher food and gasoline costs 
purchases of services were up 25 billion following a giant 
127 billion may jump that had reflected a surge in utility bills 
caused by hot weather 
disposable or aftertax incomes climbed by 06 percent in june 
following a rise in may of 08 percent 
the personal savings rate savings as a percentage of 
disposable income climbed to 59 percent in june the highest 
level since march when it was 62 percent in april the savings 
rate took a nosedive to 49 percent as americans had to write 
checks to pay income taxes 
analysts said a rising savings rate is an indication that 
consumers are becoming more cautious

investigators believe the us diplomat 
suspected of spying was recruited by the soviets 14 years ago and 
a published report today says he told the fbi he was paid a lot 
of money for his efforts 
a congressional source told the associated press the fbi 
believes felix s bloch was recruited by the kgb the soviet 
intelligence service while he was serving at the us embassy in 
east berlin 14 years ago 
the new york times today quoted an unnamed official as saying 
bloch admitted receiving money for spying it said he made the 
admission during his only interview with the fbi on june 22 the 
day he was placed on administrative leave from his state department 
job 
bloch has not been charged with any crime but remains under 
heavy fbi surveillance 
president bush told reporters today i cant give you the 
facts on the case while it is under investigation but he added 
he was very concerned out premature discussion and disclosure 
that means leaks on this matter because i think you can 
jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the mans ability to get a 
fair hearing 
officials in washington disclosed thursday that bloch received 
state department merit raises of more than 13000 while he was the 
no 2 officer in the american embassy in vienna 
the raises are given to diplomats whose work is well above 
average said a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
during the fbi interview the times said bloch refused to 
discuss his motives for spying or give details on his activities 
but it said he admitted spying for the soviets for many years 
and told the fbi that they paid me a lot of money 
three administration sources familiar with the bloch case said 
in washington thursday night that they had not been told of such 
admissions 
the times said the fbi had received information that prompted 
major interest in a recent trip bloch was making to europe and 
planned a surveillance operation 
the agency notified foreign intelligence services and 
congressional committees and somehow the information got out the 
paper said as previously reported us eavesdropping picked up a 
soviet agent telling bloch a bad virus is going around and we 
believe you are now infected 
the fbi also got permission to search his home but found nothing 
incriminating the paper said 
government sources say bloch was videotaped in paris handing a 
briefcase to a soviet agent earlier this year the contents of the 
briefcase remain unknown 
the austrian governments top police official said today that a 
suspected kgb agent who may have been a contact man for bloch 
traveled to vienna several times in the past 10 years on false 
finnish papers 
robert danzinger told reporters that austrian authorities were 
told by us officials on june 23 about a suspected kgb agent who 
allegedly had contacts with bloch 
we assume he worked for the kgb danzinger said we have 
no information of our own that he is kgb that information came 
solely from washington 
austrian interior minister franz loeschnak confirmed news 
reports that bloch had a friendship with an austrian woman over 
a period of several years 
the woman a vienna resident returned from a vacation in egypt 
and was questioned by austrian authorities this week danzinger 
said but this yielded no evidence she suspected anything about 
bloch 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
denied any soviet connection with bloch gerasimov said thursday he 
made inquiries about blochs activities the name of bloch was 
not familiar we have no connection with him he said 
blochs merit raises included an increase of 4500 for fiscal 
198384 4000 for 198485 and 4800 for 198586 said an 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but blochs raise was the lowest of three merit pay grades in 
the senior foreign service with the highest reaching about 9000 
a year the official said 
the pay increases were given to bloch while he was in vienna 
where he was posted from 1980 to 1987 former us ambassador to 
austria helene von damm who has been publicly critical of bloch 
was among those who recommended the raises said the official 
after 30 years with the state department bloch reached one of 
the most senior gradings in the foreign service and makes about 
80000 annually officials said 
merit raises in the senior foreign service are sometimes given 
to diplomats who are eligible for more senior postings but cannot 
get them because of a shortage of vacant slots 
bloch continues to draw his paycheck and benefits although his 
diplomatic passport and credentials have been revoked the 
department says 
bloch has been under tight fbi surveillance for several weeks 
agents followed him thursday as he ended a threenight stay at his 
fathers east side coop in new york city and returned by car to 
his daughters house in chappaqua ny north of the city 
agents are engaged in what is expected to be a lengthy search 
for the specific evidencethat would be required to charge bloch 
under the espionage act including what secrets if any were 
compromised 
an fbi team has arrived in vienna to assist in the investigation 
there according to fridays editions of the neue kronen zeitung 
fbi spokesmen in washington would not confirm that 
meanwhile president bush added his voice to those advocating 
improved us counterintelligence efforts 
the question is can we improve our counterintelligence we 
always ought to be striving to do that can embassy security be 
improved we go through this periodically and the answer is im 
sure it can bush told reporters thursday

hashemi rafsanjani who has become the 
most powerful figure in iran since ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
died is known to his countrymen as kuseh the shark 
some say it is because of his political ruthlessness cunning 
and business acumen that made him a millionaire all masked behind 
a smile and a sly wit 
others cite a more mundane reason his lack of facial hair 
revealing mongolian ancestry in a nation where beards are a badge 
of revolutionary manhood 
rafsanjanis election to a new more powerful presidency would 
cement the 55yearold clerics hold on power after the death june 
3 of khomeini to whom he was close throughout the decade of 
islamic revolution 
his partnership with incumbent president ayatollah ali khamenei 
the revolutionary patriarchs successor as religious leader is 
considered by many to herald a new era in iranian politics both 
advocate better relations with the west 
constitutional reforms up for approval in the same election 
abolish the office of prime minister and put the president in 
charge of the government answerable only to the parliament 
rafsanjani is a hojatoleslam a cleric of middle rank and has 
been a central figure in khomeinis revolution he was jailed for 
several years under the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi who was 
overthrown in february 1979 
since the revolution rafsanjani is said to have survived 
several assassination attempts and crushed his rivals with brutal 
efficiency 
like many iranian leaders who have seen friends and rivals 
killed in irans deadly political wars rafsanjani travels in an 
armorplated limousine and is surrounded by bodyguards 
he has dominated the parliament as its speaker and built strong 
support in irans critical power centers and among the 
350000member revolutionary guards corps which he briefly 
commanded 
abolhassan banisadr who was irans first president and fled 
when hardliners turned on him in 1981 said before khomeini died 
that rafsanjani ingratiated himself with the patriarch by playing 
the court jester 
hes a man who makes people laugh banisadr said in an 
interview in exile in france its a great art he uses this to 
gain his objectives 
rafsanjani often delivers the sermon a political speech 
more than religious discourse at tehran universitys friday prayer 
sessions 
clutching the barrel of an automatic rifle his white turban 
tilted back on his head he speaks for hours without notes unlike 
other speakers he peppers his sermons with jokes 
banisadr described rafsanjani as a machiavellian figure 
hes a political animal he said hes not brilliant as an 
organizer and he doesnt have too many original ideas but hes a 
manipulator and hes highly intelligent 
during the eightyear war with iraq in which a truce was 
reached last august rafsanjani was khomeinis representative on 
the supreme defense council a nineman board that determined 
military strategy 
he was given control of military affairs in june 1988 charged 
with reversing irans defeats and turning its tired fractious 
forces into an effective fighting machine 
diplomats said rafsanjani had sensed a growing weariness among 
irans 50 million people and believed continuing the war was futile 
amin taheri former editor of the masscirculation tehran daily 
kayhan and now in exile wrote in a recent book rafsanjani a 
conservative in social and economic policy is a radical when it 
comes to the issue of exercising power by revolutionary 
institutions 
taheri described rafsanjani is a master of intrigue and a 
capable tactician 
to many western leaders rafsanjani represents a more acceptable 
face of the islamic revolution because he believes iran needs 
outside help with reconstruction and that most iranians are weary 
of being pariahs 
while rafsanjani appears committed to the fundamentalist 
revolution and its spread his pragmatism some call it 
opportunism sets him apart from most iranian leaders 
he was at the center of the clandestine armsforhostages deal 
with the united states in 198586 and was vulnerable when rivals 
sought to discredit him but with characteristic political agility 
he emerged on top 
rafsanjani was born in behraman a village in rafsanjan province 
on the edge of irans central desert his father was a pistachio 
farmer of moderate means 
khomeini was one of his instructors at the theological seminary 
in the holy city of qom and rafsanjani joined khomeinis 
opposition to the monarchy he helped organize riots in 1963 and 
was instrumental in establishing the network of clerics that became 
khomeinis revolutionary underground

parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
appeared certain to win the presidency friday and iranians who 
flocked to vote expressed hope he would provide a better life after 
10 years of revolution and war 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi said voting was so heavy 
that many of the 26000 polling stations would stay open an extra 
seven hours until midnight some were reported to have run out of 
ballots 
mohtashemi said on television his security agencies had foiled 
plots to disrupt voting by opposition groups with the support of 
global arrogance an iranian synonym for the united states and 
its allies he did not elaborate 
nearly all voters questioned by reporters in tehran said they 
supported rafsanjani because they believed he would put the economy 
before revolutionary ideology 
the 54yearold parliament speaker has emerged as irans most 
powerful figure since the death june 3 of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini the shiite moslem patriarch whose fundamentalist 
revolution overthrew shah mohammad reza pahlavi in february 1979 
rafsanjani a cleric of middle rank is expected to move toward 
restoring relations with the west and making the economy and 
society more liberal than the stern models laid down by khomeini 
we know rafsanjani cant perform miracles but we feel hes 
the only man who can improve things engineer parzolah armandi 
said after voting in tehrans southern slums 
were tired of lining up for food said masoumeh gazian a 
housewife in the nehdat islami district who said she voted for 
rafsanjani 
we expect him to make goods more plentiful and bring down 
prices she said herding her six children 
those comments reinforced the widely held belief that rafsanjani 
would win the twocandidate race by a landslide and become the 
fourth president since the revolution 
he also will be the most powerful if voters endorse 
constitutional changes that increase the offices power the 
amendments submitted to a referendum abolish the post of prime 
minister and put the president in charge of the government 
answerable only to the 270seat parliament 
the aim is to eliminate competing power centers that have 
paralyzed government and impeded economic reform 
rafsanjanis opponent abass sheibani is a member of parliament 
and former agriculture minister he was a student activist against 
the monarchy in the 1940s spent 13 years in prison and was a 
candidate for president in 1981 
sheibani 58 has no national political base and was generally 
considered a token opponent 
newspaper polls predicted a vote of 86 percent for rafsanjani 
and 11 for sheibani 
no estimate was available of how many of the 25 million eligible 
voters turned out in the stifling summer heat the minimum voting 
age in iran is 16 
about 17 million participated in parliamentary elections last 
year and in the last contest for president in 1985 during the 
eightyear war with iraq in which a truce was reached in august 
whole families went to tehrans voting stations friday women in 
black headtotoe chador robes voted in booths separate from those 
for men 
mohtashemi the interior minister said at noon that polling 
stations are asking for more personnel in some provinces to 
handle the crowds 
rafsanjani was so confident of victory that he did not bother 
campaigning diplomatic sources said he already had formed a 
cabinet including economists and technocrats to handle the massive 
task of reconstruction 
an expected challenge from radical rivals led by mohtashemi and 
khomeinis son ahmad has not materialized apparently because 
rafsanjani and his ally incumbent president ali khamenei 
outmaneuvered them 
diplomats and analysts have not ruled out trouble however if 
rafsanjani tries to move too fast or to compromise what the 
radicals view as khomeinis ideological legacy 
television showed rafsanjani voting at a special booth in the 
courtyard of the revered khomeinis modest residence in jamaran a 
north tehran suburb 
like other voters he put two ballots into separate boxes one 
wrapped in white cloth for president the other in green cloth for 
the referendum 
about 100 revolutionary guards and local residents chanted 
allah is great and cheered as rafsanjani arrived and walked 
down a path strewn with flowers

president bush today deplored votes by the 
house of representatives to cut four major defense systems but 
predicted that his view would prevail by the time congress finishes 
work on his military budget 
at a wideranging news conference bush adopted a softtoned 
approach to the houses defense bill slashes but he said thursday 
was not the houses most memorable moment 
but were going to keep on fighting for what we believe in 
the president said he said he would not accept further cuts in the 
star wars budget to protect his other defense programs 
i do not want to negotiate with the soviet union without as 
many cards in my hands as possible he added 
bush also foresaw ultimate victory in his fight to keep 50 
billion of the cost of rescuing the savings and loan industry out 
of the budget and the deficit housesenate conferees voted 
thursday night to reject bushs plan and make the cost of the 
bailout reflected in the deficit and reduce the longterm interest 
cost 
and on a third controversy in congress bush disputed critics 
who contend his attempt to amend the constitution to prevent the 
desecration of the american flag will wind up weakening the rights 
of all americans 
we thought about it because you dont want to weaken 
anyuthing but i feel so strongly that a very carefully drawn 
amendment can solve this problem that i dont worry about it 
he declined to say if he would sign a democratic bill that would 
make the act of destroying the flag illegal but stop short of 
making it part of the constitution a house committee approved such 
a measure thursday with bipartisan support even though many 
republicans agreed with bush that a constitutional amendment is the 
proper solution 
bush said he felt no disrespect for members of congress who 
want to go the legislative rather than the amendment route to 
deal with the flag desecration issue 
the issue arose when the supreme court ruled 54 that a texas 
law against flag burning was an unconstititoonal interference with 
the rights of free speech 
bush called the news conference to ballyhoo the decision by 
arkansas congressman tommy robinson to switch parties from the 
democratic to the republican fold 
robinson the third democrat in three days to make the switch 
explained his decision i simply cannot wait any longer for the 
liberal leadership of the democratic party to see the light 
the focus of the news conference was clearly not on robinson but 
on the legislative setbacks that bush has suffered in the last few 
days 
if he had to rate congress record so far bush said i 
wouldnt give it very high marks he said that just because he 
isnt attacking congress in a personal way does not mean im 
happy with the legislative calendar he said congress had 
discarded his appeal to act on the sampl crisis within 60 days 
still bush told reporters i think we will prevail for most 
of what we want he pointed to the forthcoming defense battle in 
the senate which he hopes will rescue his defense program 
the house voted this week to slash spending for the b2 stealth 
bomber the star wars program to make the mx missile mobile and to 
eliminate all funding for the midgetman missile 
im going to put a lot of emphasis on the senate and we will 
work with people like house armed services committee chairman 
les aspin who does not want to see the defense bill gutted 
bush said 
and i do think we will prevail for most of what we want a 
strong sdi star wars program a strong b2 stealth bomber 
program he said 
on other issues 
bush said he still has confidence in william lucas his 
embattled nominee to become chief civil rights enforcer in the 
justice department 
i am convinced that much of the criticism against lucas is 
pure gut american politics he said 
bush said he was working hard to save the nomination critics 
say lucas lacks experience 
bush carefully sidestepped questions about felix s bloch the 
ranking american diplomat suspected of spying for the kgb 
i cant give you the facts on it the president said of the 
spy case i dont want to go into it while it is under 
investgation 
he said he was very concerned about premature discussion and 
disclosure that means leaks on this matter because i think you 
can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the mans ability to get 
a fair hearing 
he came down on the side of the commerce department in its 
decision to allow the export of small personal computers to the 
soviet union while acknowledging that defense secretary dick 
cheney had opposed the switch in policy 
we did have a difference inside the administration on this 
question bush said but he said he was confident that the 
commerce department stance will not endanger the legitimate 
national security needs of this country 
bush also defended his proposal to cut the rate at which 
capital gains are taxed speaker tom foley and other democratic 
leaders have been fighting it 
bush hinted he would accept a compromise on that issue but he 
said his plan would stimulate the creation of both jobs and new 
small businesses

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference friday 
bush well in the past seven months many distinguished 
americans serving in congressional state and local offices across 
this country have decided to change their party allegiance from 
democrat to republican 
men and women of great diversity but theyre united by a deep 
devotion to this nations traditional values to building an 
economy that provides growth and opportunity and to ensuring that 
america stands for peace with freedom in every corner of the globe 
they represent a growing groundswell of support a new majority 
that sees the republican party our grand old party the grand new 
party as best able to lead a strong america through the decade of 
the 90s into the new millennium 
and so it is a great privilege for me to welcome to the 
republican party a man who stands by the faith of his principles 
and has helped keep america free arkansas rep tommy robinson a 
man of exceptional caliber 
tommy robinson is a man of the people a man who believes in 
straight talk hard work and getting the job done rebuilding our 
defenses standing up for veterans for small business and 
fighting the war on drugs 
so tommy whoops 
robinson im on the wrong side 
bush welcome to our party 
robinson hes used to me being a democrat he looks to his 
left laughter 
bush well i should welcome my your party the republican 
party 
we look forward to working with you 
and im going to ask the congressman to say a few words and 
then both he and i will respond to some questions 
i might welcome my old colleague john paul hammerschmidt here 
and guy vander jagt two classmates of mine in the congress who 
feel as enthusiastic about this as i do and also of course our 
party chairman 
its all yours 
robinson thank you mr president for your kind words of 
welcome to the republican party 
i am grateful for your confidence and support 
i look forward to working closely with you in building an even 
stronger america in arkansas 
public service has been the cornerstone of my life 
i have served at the local county state and federal levels 
for the past 30 years 
i chose a life of public service because my parents taught me 
that if you worked for the government you worked for the people 
you served people 
my parents raised me in the tradition of harry truman 
lunchbucket democrats and patriotism without apology 
but today to best serve the people of arkansas and to stay true 
to the values of my family and an everincreasing number of 
arkansans i can no longer be a member of the national democratic 
party 
this is a very personal private decision 
it has been long in coming because frankly i hoped that the 
national democratic party would come back home and once again be in 
touch with the mainstream of the american people 
but even after losing five of the last six presidential 
elections both nationwide and in arkansas the leadership of the 
national democratic party still is unwilling to listen to the 
majority of the american people 
if i am to meet the needs of my people i simply cannot wait any 
longer for the liberal leadership of the democratic party to see 
the light 
the hard fact is that there is and will be no room for 
conservative southern democrats in todays national democratic 
party 
now my conscience is clear 
i have made my decision 
i am excited about our new partnership with president bush 
i know it will be good for the future of all the people of 
arkansas 
mr president i am proud to stand with you and the republican 
party knowing we share the common goal of getting the job done for 
america and arkansas

president bush said friday he is willing to 
compromise with congress on his proposal to cut capitalgains taxes 
and he repeated his contention that such a reduction would actually 
increase revenues 
if theres some compromise that can spur investment spur 
jobs increase employment the cause of new jobs starting up id 
be interested in it bush told a news conference i dont think 
i should ever say its got to be done just this way in terms of the 
bills up there in the house ways and means committee right now 
bushs proposal would cut the 33percent maximum capitalgains 
rate to 15 percent which would apply to stocks and most other 
assets but not timber and real estate there is little support for 
that proposal among democrats on the committee 
however all 13 committee republicans and six democrats a 
majority of the panel are backing a substitute by rep edgar 
jenkins dga it would cut the top rate to 20 percent for two 
years for assets including timber and real estate then raise it to 
28 percent and protect against taxation of gains that are 
attributable solely to inflation 
democratic leaders have blocked a vote on that proposal while 
they negotiate toward a compromise with the bush administration 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the committee chairman told 
reporters friday all we have been doing is discussing but 
theres no offer of a compromise 
a rate reduction is absolutely out of the question he 
added 
under discussion is a plan that instead of cutting the 
capitalgains rate would prevent taxation of inflationcaused 
profits and exempt from taxation an additional 1 percent a year of 
asset value 
democrats generally oppose a cut in the capitalgains tax rate 
because 80 percent of the tax reduction would go to those with 
incomes over 100000 a year they also insist that while a 
reduction would accelerate sales of investment temporarily after a 
year or so a cut in the rate would reduce revenues 
bush addressed both points friday as he did regularly during 
his campaign last year 
i have a good sound proposal it was tested during the 
campaign and the other side particularly the liberal democrats 
attacked me as having some kind of tax cut favoring the rich 
he said its nothing like that at all 
as for causing a longterm revenue loss he pointed to the 
experience of a capitalgains reduction enacted in 1978 its not 
a revenue loser he said 
the treasury department predicts bushs proposed reduction in 
the capitalgains tax rate would raise 161 billion over five 
years but then would lose 201 billion over the next three years 
the staff of the joint committee on taxation estimates that a 
total revenue gain of 4 billion in 1989 and 1990 followed by a 
string of losses that would total 71 billion through 1999

moslem guerrillas fired rockets into 
kabul on friday killing 10 people and foreign minister abdul 
wakil accused the united states and pakistan of preparing a major 
offensive to oust his government 
bakhtar state news agency reported 17 surfacetosurface rockets 
hit residential areas of the afghan capital killing 10 people and 
injuring 19 
wakil told reporters the united states and pakistan are talking 
peace but preparing for war against his sovietbacked government 
he urged the two countries to stop arming afghan rebels and 
take some effective practical steps toward a political solution 
he expressed hope that us and soviet diplomats will focus on a 
comprehensive political settlement of afghanistans 11year civil 
war when they meet monday in stockholm 
as wakil left the airport after returning from a 12day trip to 
ethiopia and india a rocket exploded less than a mile away 
churning up a cloud of dust the extent of damage or casualties was 
not known immediately 
several other rockets later struck the same microrayon area a 
residential district for government employees that once housed 
soviet officials before the last red army troops withdrew feb 15 
in the past month fundamentalist moslem guerrillas have been 
launching longrange rockets from behind the hills that ring the 
milehigh capital more than 200 people nearly all civilians been 
killed in the attacks and a car bombing 
wakil was asked whether he has discerned any progress toward a 
political settlement following last months washington meeting 
between president bush and prime minister benazir bhutto of 
pakistan 
the two agreed for the first time to press for a political 
solution in afghanistan but said they will continue arming the 
guerrillas and seeking to oust president najib a former secret 
police chief who is staunchly backed by moscow 
i think they verbally speak of political settlement but in 
practice they have concentrated all their efforts to intensify 
aggression and war he said 
the foreign minister cited reports quoting unidentified bush 
advisers as saying washington will arm the guerrillas with advanced 
new weapons to combat highaltitude bombing attacks by the afghan 
air force 
we are of the opinion that the united states of america is 
getting prepared for the battle season and for the extensive 
offensive in the coming months instead of preparing for a peaceful 
solution he said 
the foreign minister said the afghan government considers the 
ussoviet meeting in stockholm useful the us delegation will 
be led by john kelly assistant secretary of state for near eastern 
and south asian affairs and roving ambassador nikolai i kozyrev 
will guide the soviets 
the most important thing that the united states and the soviet 
union should do is encourage hostile groups to find the 
possibility for starting dialogue talks and negotiations wakil 
said 
i think the united states and the soviet union in the meeting 
should talk over an extensive comprehensive program for the 
republic of afghanistan for the settlement of the problem because 
the cessation or stopping of the supply of weapons is not enough 
wakil said the united states wont succeed in a military 
solution the kabul government did not collapse after the soviet 
pullout as western governments predicted and it wont fall in the 
future he said 
he also said the afghan leaderships desire for a settlement has 
dictated its great patience in dealing with pakistan which he 
charged is openly at war with kabul 
in addis ababa wakil said he received support for 
afghanistans peace initiatives from 30 leaders of the organization 
of african unity meeting there 
he said he also held talks in new delhi on thursday with indian 
prime minister rajiv gandhi who has discussed a political 
settlement in afghanistan with ms bhutto soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar

india decided to resume withdrawing 
its peacekeeping troops friday on one of the island nations worst 
days of ethnic violence in which state tv reported 74 people were 
killed 
the decision to start pulling out more troops starting saturday 
averted a showdown with sri lankan president ranasinghe premadasa 
who had called the continued indian presence a threat to his 
nations independence 
the bush administration said it hopes the agreement saves lives 
we welcome this development and hope that india and sri lanka 
will be successful in reaching an agreement on a timetable for 
withdrawal that minimizes bloodshed while recognizing sri lankas 
sovereignty and independence said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
television in colombo said most of those who died were killed by 
sri lankan forces in areas where the indians are not deployed most 
died in the sinhalese heartland where extremists from premadasas 
own ethnic community have violently protested government peace 
efforts with the tamil minority and the continued presence of the 
indian troops 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who account 
for 75 percent of the population and control the government and 
armed forces 
india spurred by its own politically powerful tamil minority of 
60 million sponsored the july 29 1987 peace accord designed to 
give tamils some autonomy in northern and eastern sri lanka but 
the biggest tamil guerrilla group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam reneged on the pact and started attacking the indians 
the telecast referred to those who died friday as 
troublemakers and disruptive elements terms frequently used 
for sinhalese radicals 
it said 16 people were killed when they attacked a police 
station at mannikhina near kandy about 60 miles northeast of 
colombo 
sri lankan security forces killed 21 more people who defied a 
curfew to stage antiindia demonstrations in the monargala district 
about 100 miles east of colombo state tv said 
five people were killed when they ignored a curfew in the 
predominantly tamil town of batticaloa 100 miles northeast of 
colombo the newscast said 
the other deaths were scattered throughout central and southern 
sri lanka 
premadasa originally sought the departure of all of indias 
45000 soldiers by saturday he announced the decision about an 
hour after it was publicized by government spokesmen in colombo and 
new delhi 
neither side indicated how many indian soldiers would leave but 
only a token force was likely to depart 
foreign minister ranjan wijeratne and six other sri lankan 
officials were to fly to new delhi to discuss a timetable for the 
withdrawal of the rest of the indian troops 
premadasa sought to portray the indian decision as a victory 
the twoyear indian military presence has fueled sri lankas ethnic 
violence among the tamil guerrillas that the indians were supposed 
to disarm and sinhalese extremists who denounced the indian 
presence as a violation of sri lankan sovereignty 
the protests staged against the continuance of the ipkf 
indian peace keeping force in our country can now cease he 
said by resorting to strikes and disruptive activities based on 
such protests we are causing damage and harm to ourselves it is 
our own people who get killed 
military troops and police were enforcing a nationwide curfew 
designed to thwart threatened disruptions by sinhalese radicals 
accused of killing 4000 people mostly sinhalese government 
officials and supporters since indian troops started arriving 
july 30 1987 
the curfew began thursday and was to continue until dawn sunday 
another 11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have 
died in the tamil separatist war that started in 1983 
premadasa said the talks in new delhi were to prepare a time 
frame a timetable for the complete withdrawal of the indian army 
and also to ensure the cessation of offensive military operations 
and for reviewing the implementation of the indosri lanka accord 
the compromise under which india was to resume its troop 
withdrawal was signed friday in colombo by the indian high 
commissioner or ambassador lakhan lal mehrotra and by sri lankan 
foreign secretary bernard tillekeratne 
in new delhi foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth called the 
agreement a victory of reason goodwill and good sense 
at the peak of its involvement in sri lanka indias 
peacekeeping force numbered at least 70000 the most recent 
withdrawals were in january and february when about 5000 indian 
soldiers left shortly after premadasa took office

i am as are most people in my state impressed with the 
philosophy and the practical solutions you are presenting 
i too believe in less government not more 
and i too believe that we must first seek government 
efficiency and cut government waste before asking the american 
taxpayers to pay even more 
i too believe that we must dramatically improve our 
educational institutions if we are to compete in the modern world 
i too believe in the strong defense policy which has finally 
forced the soviets to real negotiations 
mr president peace through strength is once again a proven 
concept and i too believe in preserving the traditional family 
values that must be the moral backbone of the nation 
mr president today i am translating our shared beliefs into 
positive action by joining the republican party 
i am enthusiastic about working with you 
i know that my optimism about what this new partnership will 
mean for all the people of arkansas is fully warranted 
thank you mr president 
we in arkansas are proud of you 
bush thank you tommy 
now be glad to take questions and i expect the congressman 
will so address them as you will 
but we should start off with the ap i think today 
q mr president the house has just turned your pentagon 
spending priorities inside out and its leaving a shambles that 
congressman aspin says is a michael dukakis defense bill what 
steps are you what movement are you willing to make to turn it 
back to a george bush defense bill and i have a followup 
bush putting a lot of emphasis on the senate work with people 
like chairman aspin who does not want to see the defense bill 
gutted and i think that we will prevail for most of what we want 
we have a strategic concept and what i need is a strong sdi 
program a strong b2 program 
were doing reasonably well on many of our conventional force 
allocations there 
but i do not want to negotiate with the soviet union without as 
many cards in my hand as possible so theres an arms control 
dimension to what were talking about too 
but weve sent up a solid strategic program 
i am disappointed that the house did what they did 
we have a defense secretary who has made some tough cuts and 
set some priorities and done that which many have failed to do 
and that is to cut out some systems 
but then the house regrettably is looking at it more narrowly 
than i am and they have restored some of the very things that the 
secretary of defense and the joint chiefs felt that we could get 
along without 
in fact i see that they are even talking about trying to keep 
open some of the bases that we have suggested be closed and that 
isnt its not easy to close a base 
so i want to get support across the board in the congress for 
our defense program and yesterday was not the houses most 
memorable moment 
but were going to keep fighting on for what we believe in 
q youve said that you think you can get most of what you want 
would you be willing to scale back on sdi for example to win back 
some money from stealth bomber which you think is so critical

the state comptroller refused friday to 
certify yonkers 198990 budget because the city council refuses to 
clearly allocate money for courtordered school construction in a 
desegregation plan 
the move could send the city into technical default and subject 
it to a spending plan imposed by a judge 
the budget struggle stems from the city councils longterm 
opposition to courtordered desegregation a stance that nearly put 
the city into bankruptcy last year when a federal judge imposed a 
series of fines 
spokesman marvin nailor said state comptroller edward regan 
would not sign off on the 3723 million budget approved by the 
city council on thursday because there was no clear inclusion of 
24 million for courtordered school construction 
the state emergency financial control board had refused to 
approve an earlier similar version of the budget because the 24 
million had been drawn from the citys surplus and was not in a 
fund designating it specifically for the schools 
a compromise budget submitted by the control board utilized 
about 12 million of the surplus combined with cuts and other 
funding in an account earmarked for the schools but it was 
rejected two weeks ago by the city council 
the control board has imposed a wage and hiring freeze on the 
city 
the budget rejected by regan had the school funding money in an 
account called claims and judgments with no particular 
reference or formal allocation to the board of education 
the majority of this council is dead set against putting their 
fingerprints on anything related to desegregation complained 
mayor nicholas wasicsko 
without a certified budget the city would be technically in 
default monday a situation under which the comptroller is supposed 
to ask a state judge to impose a budget 
city officials have indicated that the comptrollers office 
would ask the judge to impose the control boards compromise 
budget which would avert layoffs maintain service and allow 
leeway for raises 
us district judge leonard sand had ordered new schools built 
as a way of remedying the more than 40 years of segregation he had 
found in the citys schools and housing 
earlier this week the city voted to challenge the location for

israeli commandos armed with 
silencerequipped pistols today kidnapped a shiite moslem leader 
allegedly linked to the abduction of a us marine and carried him 
off to israel in a helicopter police said 
sheik abdul karim obeid 33 was seized at his apartment in 
jibchit 21 miles north of the israeli border 
the israeli military confirmed the seizure and said obeid was 
suspected of instigating attacks on israel it gave no details of 
the abduction 
president bush told reporters in washington he was unsure what 
effect the raid would have on attempts to free the marine but bush 
added i dont think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of 
peace in the middle east 
he said his administration would contact israeli officials to 
discuss the abduction of obeid and its consequences 
obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of the proiranian 
hezbollah militia in south lebanon and is irans closest ally in 
the region he denies links to hezbollah which is affiliated with 
shiite moslem factions holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in 
lebanon nine hostages are americans 
security sources in south lebanon said one of the americans 
marine lt col william r higgins was briefly held at obeids 
apartment after his abduction in south lebanon on feb 17 1988 
lebanese police said an israeli helicopter landed a commando 
force about two miles west of jibchit at 1 am 
about 12 commandoes walked into jibchit surrounded obeids 
building then knocked on the door of his secondfloor apartment 
and forced their way in when the door was opened 
the israelis quickly moved in pointing silencerequipped 
pistols at the sheik his cousin ahmed obeid and majid fahs a 
friend who was staying with them the spokesman said 
as the israeli force was leaving with the three men a neighbor 
hussein abu zeid apparently heard some noise and opened his door 
to find out what was happening they shot him in the head and he 
died instantly the spokesman added 
israel radio said the man was a bodyguard to obeid 
the israeli army communique made no mention of the slaying it 
said the israelis suffered no casualties 
the police spokesman said obeids wife mona was locked in a 
room with her hands tied and her mouth taped he said the israelis 
also locked the door where obeids three sons and two daughters 
were sleeping 
a security source in lebanon said there was speculation obeid 
may have been kidnapped as a possible swap for higgins or for 
three missing israeli soldiers 
two of the soldiers yossi fink and rahamin alsheikh were 
captured feb 17 1986 when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in 
israels selfproclaimed security zone in southern lebanon the 
third navigator ron arad was captured by shiite militiamen oct 
16 1986 when his plane was shot down over southern lebanon 
higgins 44 of danville ky was heading an observer group 
attached to the un peacekeeping force in lebanon at the time of 
his abduction he was seized in the southern port of tyre near the 
base of the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia 
one of the lebanese security sources said the late leader of 
amal in south lebanon daoud daoud sent a group of his followers 
to obtain higgins release from obeids apartment but the force 
was encircled by hezbollah gunmen stripped of its weapons and sent 
back 
the source said higgins kidnappers the organization of the 
oppressed on earth then moved the marine out of jibchit 
residents of jibchit which is 35 miles south of beirut said 
amal called a general mobilization of its militia in the area to 
confront the israeli force and rescue obeid but it was too late 
one resident speaking on condition of anonymity said local 
amal leaders urged whoever is capable of carrying weapons to join 
a campaign in search of sheik obeid 
i heard the helicopter flying as the general mobilization call 
was blared he said 
obeid has been the imam or local religious leader of jibchit 
since 1984 he succeeded sheik raged hard who was shot to death by 
unknown gunmen 
the israeli communique issued more than 15 hours after the 
raid said obeid was raised and educated in iran and was an 
instigator of attacks on israeli army forces and israel 
he dealt with encouraging the struggle and authorizing 
terrorist attacks against israel the communique said he also 
dealt with passing on weapons to hezbollah guerrillas in the south 
and arranging shelter for those who committed the attacks

leading orthodox rabbis issued a religious 
ruling friday that said jewish law forbids israel from withdrawing 
from the occupied west bank 
in response a leftleaning religious legislator accused the 
chief rabbinate of interfering in politics and another politician 
called for an investigation of the religious body 
in the onepage ruling published friday the rabbis said 
pikuach nefesh a central idea in judaism that saving life 
overshadows other religious commandments obliges us not to 
retreat from the borders we hold today 
withdrawal of the israeli army may increase the danger of 
fatal attacks from the abandoned territory they said 
rabbinate spokesman eitan aizman said he interpreted the ruling 
as saying it is a religious commandment to retain the land of 
israel in our hands 
although not binding their ruling is bound to be influential 
most israeli jews are orthodox conservative and reform jewry the 
largest groups in the united states are not represented in the 
chief rabbinate 
israeli media reports said the ruling was issued in response to 
a statement by israels former chief rabbi ovadiya yosef who told 
egyptian president hosni mubarak last week that halacha or the 
body of jewish religious teaching justifies a land compromise as a 
matter of saving lives 
the rabbinate said it was surprised and sorrowful because 
jews could tell a nonjewish ruler we are obliged by law to hold 
on to judea and samaria but you are prepared to kill jews if we 
dont withdraw therefore we have to withdraw 
the 19month palestinian uprising against israels 22year 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip has left more than 560 
palestinians and 36 israelis dead israel fought wars with arab 
countries in 1967 and 1973 
the chief rabbis ruling referred only to judea and samaria the 
biblical names for the west bank and did not mention the occupied 
gaza strip 
it was published a day after israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir made an impassionate speech to leading rabbis in jerusalem 
for retaining all occupied land 
its possible to reach peace without heaven forbid giving up 
a grain of the holy land of our forefathers shamir said peace 
is not a monopoly of the traitors concessionmakers and 
defeatists 
the chief rabbinate is presided over by israels two chief 
orthodox rabbis mordechai eliahu representing sephardi jews from 
middle eastern countries and avraham shapiro representing ashkenasi 
jews from europe and america 
sephardis and ashkenasis have separate religious traditions 
the rabbinate has made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to halt 
movies and sports events on saturday the jewish sabbath 
elazar granot a leader of the leftist mapam party responded to 
fridays ruling by demanding a government investigation to 
determine whether the ruling wasnt an explicit and serious 
deviation from the rabbinates authority and whether proper 
sanctions shouldnt be taken against this deviation 
abraham burg a religious legislator from the labor party and 
the son of a former interior minister yosef burg charged that the 
rabbinate became part of the political establishment and somehow 
lost its spiritual authority becoming a pawn in the political 
game 
just as i dont expect the premier to rule about kosher and 
the chief of staff to teach me commandments i dont expect chief 
rabbis to get involved in state affairs burg told israel army 
radio 
burgs leftleaning labor party advocates trading parts of the 
occupied lands for peace shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes 
any territorial compromise 
the palestine liberation organization has officially endorsed a 
twostate solution but islamic groups another leading force in the 
palestinian uprising want a moslem state that would include israel

a judge rejected mentalillness pleas 
friday and sentenced a retired librarian to the electric chair for 
killing two policemen during a 1987 shoppingcenter rampage in 
which four other people also died 
william bryan cruse also was sentenced to 100 years in prison 
without parole on the other four killings and lesser prison terms 
on 26 other convictions of attempted murder kidnapping and false 
imprisonment 
judge john antoon called the shooting spree in which 10 people 
were wounded in nearby palm bay perhaps unsurpassed in the state 
of florida 
under mandatoryminimum sentencing regulations cruses total 
prison sentence would be 103 years in prison unless he is executed 
for the slayings of the two police officers 
we are pleased that william cruse has been finally sentenced 
to death we feel it is a just punishment for the war mr cruse 
declared on palm bay two years ago said state attorney norm 
wolfinger 
assistant public defender marlene alva cruses chief trial 
lawyer would not comment on the sentences except to say that 
somewhere down the line someone has to determine competency for 
execution 
an appeal of the convictions and sentences will be filed soon 
she said 
cruse told investigators after his capture following a 
sevenhour siege that he got into trouble because everyone 
believed he was homosexual he said he was trying to get even with 
people who taunted him and that he was drunk and crazy during 
the shootout 
cruse refused an opportunity to address the court friday as he 
has in the past but he did appear to wipe away a tear or two while 
one of the shooting victims recounted his experiences amidst sobs 
when we entered that battlefield we did not know whether we 
would come out alive said larry glynn 43 as he told the court 
how he and a friend drove more than 15 shooting victims to safety 
in their pickup during the shootout 
if you really want to punish mr cruse let him live glynn 
said 
the central issue in the case was cruses mental state the 
defense pleaded temporary insanity caused by mental illness 
psychiatric specialists on both sides agreed that cruse was 
mentally ill 
but the prosecution convinced a jury in april that mental 
illness was only one factor involved in a finding of criminal 
insanity under florida law 
the jury recommended the death penalty on each of the six 
firstdegree murder counts but the judge did not have to follow 
that recommendation 
although rejecting insanity the judge did accept arguments of 
extreme mental disturbance that lessened the penalties in the 
slayings of the four civilians 
he imposed life sentences without possibility of parole for 25 
years in each of those murders 
antoon imposed life terms on each of 22 counts of attempted 
firstdegree murder and the kidnapping of a store clerk who was 
held hostage most of the time cruse was barricaded inside a 
supermarket 
antoon also handed down 30year sentences on each of two counts 
of attempted seconddegree murder and a 15year term for false 
imprisonment of a second store employee 
except for the firstdegreemurder sentences all other prison 
terms are to run concurrently and each carries a mandatoryminimum 
of three years

bush i will point out to the american people that sdi has 
already been cut in our own setting of priorities 
we didnt want to do it 
it was a tough decision for secretary cheney to make 
i approved the decision and we dont need further cuts in sdi 
helen 
q mr president in the veto department will you veto the sampl 
bill if a portion of the bailout is on the budget and will you veto 
the flag desecration bill 
bush it wont come to vetoing the sampl because we have 40plus 
votes in the senate that staying firm will see our proposal 
prevail 
the house as you know has disagreed with us but im confident 
that we will do all right on that one 
i worry about bending and breaking the grammrudman limits and i 
think it would send a very bad sign to international markets 
so i dont think theres a problem there and on this other one 
different people have different ways of expressing their outrage 
about the desecration of the flag 
its very interesting to see a groundswell of support for the 
principle of protecting the american flag and so i will see what 
comes down here but i will continue to push for the approach that 
i think is the best given the supreme court decision 
q it sounds like you might sign it 
bush i didnt say that 
q mr president you have courted members of congress 
individually and collectively quite assiduously youve been gentle 
in your criticism of them when things have not gone your way you 
have been so again here today in light of what is happening up 
there to these defense priorities and in light of what i think many 
members of congress would acknowledge is a lot of parochial 
politics being played with that bill do you think it may now be 
time for stronger medicine from you 
bush well if i could think of a medicine that would cure the 
ill i would certainly apply it because im not sure namecalling 
or questioning somebodys motives it sometimes happens on the 
hill questioning my motives helen just asked about the flag but 
i dont know that thats the approach thats going to be successful 
were going to keep working with the congress but tommy 
robinson heres a good time to say with the underpinning of the 
principles that i was elected on and were going to keep doing that 
im not sure i need to get into the namecalling 
wed be out here all day if i said what i felt on that 
q well are you not concerned sir that this affable approach 
to this sort of thing will make you appear weak 
bush no im not concerned at all 
we have a democratic majority in the senate a democratic 
majority in the house 
i have to work with these people 
i will work with these people

thousands of striking russians went 
back to work friday in estonia as their representatives began talks 
with a government commission set up to consider complaints that new 
estonian laws infringe on their voting rights 
we are working during the talks said gennady korol a 
strike committee spokesman at the tallinn shipyard 
local activists meanwhile applauded preliminary approval in 
moscow by the national legislature of a law giving the three baltic 
states estonia latvia and lithuania greater control over their 
economies including the possibility of creating their own 
currencies 
the russian workers went on strike a week ago to protest a law 
requiring many of them to learn to speak estonian and another 
demanding two years residency to vote and at least five years 
residency to stand for office russian speakers make up a third of 
the baltic republics 16 million population 
mark r shlendukhov a strike committee spokesman said as many 
as 32 factories had stopped work at the height of the strike but a 
journalist for the estonian telegraph agency elkond liebman said 
the number was about 15 
in moscow the supreme soviet on thursday approved the first of 
three necessary readings of two resolutions that would give the 
republics economic independence by jan 1 
we thought it was a great victory because we got an 
overwhelming majority in the parliament said rein veidemann 
chairman of the 11member governing board of the estonian popular 
front its an economic victory and also a big political 
victory 
mikhail bronstein an estonian economist credited with devising 
the autonomy plan said the version given preliminary approval 
thursday by the supreme soviet will allow his republic to have its 
own monetary and financial system 
bronstein said a separate currency would allow for price reform 
many stateset prices have no relation to costs in the soviet 
union but the kremlin has hesitated to eliminiate hidden subsidies 
of food and housing for fear of mass unrest 
the resolutions if passed into law would wrest control of 
industry from moscowbased ministries and gives it to the republic 
businesses or groups of enterprises would be permitted to trade 
directly with firms in the other 14 soviet republics 
we can use the ruble for trade with other republics while our 
own currency would be used to defend the population against 
inflation and wild fluctuation of prices by controlling the new 
money supply while introducing market force economics bronstein 
said 
the soviet union blames a vast oversupply of rubles for many of 
its own economic problems wages have risen faster than production 
so workers have plenty of cash but there is nothing to buy 
the baltic republics have complained for years that moscow 
ministries exploited the onceindependent republics taking away 
their natural resources and giving little back 
the legislature debated two days before initial approval of the 
two resolutions by what the tass news agency said was an 
overwhelming majority of the 412 deputies present it called on the 
cabinet to draw up draft laws for ratification by the supreme 
soviet by oct 1 
the first resolution calls for lithuania latvia and estonia to 
convert to a profit and loss cost accounting system which would 
allow them to sign independent trade agreements with the other 12 
soviet republics 
the second approved a draft law on economic independence 
lithuania and estonia have already declared themselves sovereign 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov made it clear the resolutions 
apply to all three republics although latvias supreme soviet only 
approved economic independence plans thursday and had no time to 
give its proposals to moscow 
critics of the resolutions said it was unfair to grant the 
baltics economic freedom before such rights were offered to all the 
republics 
under the proposed legislation baltic trade relations between 
moscow and other soviet republics will be based on contracts rather 
than the present command system whereby ministers in moscow 
make economic decisions said tarmu tammerk an editor at the 
estonian newspaper kodumaa 
estonia with westernstyle shops and an atmosphere more like 
nearby finland than the soviet union has been a proving ground for 
many of president mikhail s gorbachevs economic and political 
reforms 
in the republic of georgia meanwhile a newspaper said clashes 
there in the past two weeks have killed 14 people and injured 448 
nine of the 14 dead were abkhazian the georgian newspaper zarya 
vostoka said while 302 of the 448 injured were georgian 
at least three of the dead may have been killed for nonethnic 
reasons the newspaper said tass has reported a higher death toll 
of 21 but there was no explanation of the discrepancy 
georgian activists claim that the abkhazian rioting was preceded 
by weeks of threats by abkhazian activists and during that time 
they obtained massive amounts of arms 
although both georgians and abkhazians claim discrimination 
georgian activists say the unrest was deliberately instigated to 
divert attention from their demands for independence and to break 
abkhazia off from the rest of georgia

explorer will steger and his 
international transantarctica expedition team were into the second 
day friday of their 11 million 4000mile sevenmonth traverse 
of the continent 
steger of ely and his five foreign companions left from the 
northwestern tip of the antarctic peninsula on thursday five days 
ahead of schedule on a quest intended to alert the world to 
environmental dangers and to antarcticas tradition of peace 
the trek also could establish steger as the contemporary expert 
on coldweather survival putting him in the company of such 
turnofthecentury heroes as robert peary roald amundsen and 
robert falcon scott 
im still too busy to think about what all this means the 
44yearold steger said moments before his anxious dogs broke free 
of the sled brake and raced off ive got a lot riding on this 
and itll be good to be out on the ice so i can sort it all through 
my mind 
an abctv field producer and a threeperson film crew from 
france loaded their own sled and mushed after the expedition team 
to record its first week on the ice 
the st paulbased expedition team spent wednesday night camped 
on the larsen ice shelf beneath a ridge of mountain peaks known as 
seal nunataks on the northwestern tip of the antarctic peninsula 
temperatures fell to about 8 below zero but the sky remained 
unseasonably clear and still 
tv and newspaper reporters flew to the peninsula from king 
george island thursday morning capitalizing on a rare and 
expansive window of clear weather to chronicle the official launch 
the ice shelf was slick with hardpacked snow and patches of blue 
ice daytime temperatures reached 10 above zero with the sun 
blindingly bright 
the fourday window of clear weather that has held since steger 
arrived at king george island monday is rare for this time of the 
austral winter 
weve been really blessed with this weather steger said 
this is probably the warmest it will be for the next seven 
months 
once on the ice the mushers seemed little concerned with the 
deeper meaning of their journey and were focused on more immediate 
matters weather packing teaming sled dogs to avoid fights 
i cant think about seven months said keizo funatsu of 
japan i only think about one day and one day and one day 
french arctic explorer jeanlouis etienne a physician pointed 
reporters away from the dramatic mountains of the peninsula toward 
the endless white monotony of the ice shelf 
the peninsula is the best part of antarctica and is very 
beautiful he said then nodded to the flat featureless plateau 
but that is what we will look at most of the time nothing 
in 1986 steger and several other companions reached the north 
pole via dogsleds and joined forces with etienne who had skied 
there alone 
the antarctic expedition will be accompanied by film crews again 
in october in the ellsworth mountains where the peninsula widens 
into the endless interior ice cap and at the south pole about 
thanksgiving the mushers hope to reach the soviet scientific base 
of mirnyy on the continents eastern shore by march 1

a federal judge has ordered that records 
of the defunct state sovereignty commission which tried to thwart 
the work of civil rights groups in the 1950s and 1960s be opened 
to the public 
the state of mississippi acted directly through its state 
sovereignty commission and through conspiracy with private 
individuals to deprive the plaintiffs of rights protected by the 
constitution to free speech and association to personal privacy 
and to lawful search and seizure and statutes of the united 
states us district judge william h barbour jr ruled thursday 
barbour permanently barred the state from enforcing a law making 
it a crime to disclose the records which have been sealed since 
1977 but the judge ruled that the records wont be released 
pending a possible appeal 
assistant attorney general jim warren said friday the state 
wont appeal gov ray mabus said he supported that decision 
we feel that by closing this chapter of mississippi and 
opening the files will allow mississippi to focus on the future 
mabus said 
the records are held in six file cabinets by the state 
department of archives and history in a vault in jackson 
the commission was created in 1956 and shut down in 1973 the 
1977 legislature ordered the records sealed until 2027 the aclu 
and civil rights activists sued the state the same year to open the 
records 
barbour noted in his ruling that some records were destroyed or 
removed years ago 
a memo in the record establishes that in 1965 the commission 
director ordered the destruction of all files which might show 
interference by commission agents with voter registration there 
are other gaps which indicate that files have been lost pilfered 
or destroyed barbour wrote 
former forest mayor erle johnston was commission director from 
1963 until 1968 
regardless of whatever information that was available to judge 
barbour we did not destroy files in 1965 or any other year 
johnston said 
johnston said neither he nor his secretary who was in charge of 
the files disturbed the files except for one which concerned 
david bowen later a fiveterm congressman 
the short file was actually a subtle criticism of bowens 
fraternizing with ultraliberal professors while he was at millsaps 
college he said 
most plaintiffs in the lawsuit sought to make the documents 
public but two of them the rev edwin king of jackson and john 
salter jr of grand fork nd requested the records remain closed 
while an appeal is pursued american civil liberties union lawyer 
shirley payne said 
i just feel everybodys privacy was violated by the state in 
illegally spying on people and it shouldnt be violated again by 
making these records public king said thursday 
my position is that the rights of citizens not to be spied 
on or to be manipulated by a secret police is very important i 
dont think people whove been spied upon should have that material 
released the state should never have secured it king said 
salter said private or personal information obtained by the 
commission illegally should remain closed but other general 
documents should be open 
we always felt the personal material should be released only 
to the victims the victims would be free to use the material any 
way they wish including bringing damage suits against the state 
salter said

president bush said friday he did not condone 
the kidnapping of a shiite moslem leader by israeli commandoes in 
lebanon and doesnt know if the act will lead to freedom for an 
american hostage 
bush responding to questions at a news conference also said he 
had not been in touch with the israelis after their capture of 
sheik abdul karim obeid in the lebanon village of jibchit 21 north 
of the israeli border earlier in the day 
bush was asked whether obeids capture enhanced the cause of 
peace in the middle east 
i dont think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of 
peace he responded 
sources in lebanon said obeid is considered irans closest ally 
and was linked to the abduction of marine lt col william r 
higgins head of the 75man observer group attached to the un 
interim force in lebanon on feb 17 1988 
higgins is one of nine americans held in lebanon presumably by 
proiranian shiite moslems 
bush said he didnt know what ramifications the capture of obeid 
would have 
i cant tell you whether i think these two things can 
interact the kidnapping and perhaps the subsequent release of 
this man whether thatll benefit the higgins case or not the 
president said 
he did say however that the freeing of colonel higgins is 
very much on my mind and the freeing of the other hostages is 
bush said he had not contacted the israelis although other 
americans had this thing just happened 
obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of hezbollah or 
party of god in south lebanon 
he has repeatedly denied however any ties with the proiranian 
group which is affiliated with factions holding most of the 17 
foreign hostages in lebanon nine americans are among the hostages

i have never been too hot at being a namecaller and i think 
they know the principles upon which i stand 
and i will i think were going to prevail and i am going to 
keep working for what i believe in 
but its a question of style i think and well ill take a 
shot at them once in a while if they get too outrageous 
yeah jackie 
q mr president i wonder at your reaction to the israeli 
kidnapping this morning of hezbollah leader obeid and whether you 
think that improves chances now for getting back colonel higgins or 
any of the other american hostages 
bush well i dont know because the freeing of colonel higgins 
is very much on my mind and the freeing of the other hostages is 
i cant tell you jackie whether i think there these two 
things can interact the kidnapping and perhaps the subsequent 
release of this man whether thatll benefit the higgins case or 
not 
i just dont know 
q have you been in touch with the israelis about the 
kidnapping and do you approve of that 
bush well i think that the i know that our people will be in 
touch 
this thing this just happened 
i havent personally 
yeah 
q mr president during the john tower controversy you spoke 
out strongly and often in his defense right now your nominee for 
assistant attorney general for civil rights william lucas is 
under fire on the hill yet we havent heard from you on this 
bush you just havent been listening or reading because let 
me use this occasion and im glad you raised it i strongly 
support bill lucas 
i am convinced that much not all but much of the criticism 
of him is pure gut american politics 
and it started long before day one of the hearings 
and this is a man that served as a democrat was widely 
respected switched to the republican party and then people piled 
on to a faretheewell 
and i have he has my confidence and im glad you gave me this 
opportunity to express that confidence more publicly 
but let the record show ive made phone calls for him we had an 
interview with owen ullmann here and others sorry ellen 
laughter the other day on this subject and laughing so

austrian officials said friday the united 
states alerted them about a man who visited vienna often and may 
have been a soviet contact for felix bloch the american diplomat 
suspected of spying for moscow 
robert danzinger the national police chief said us officials 
told austria on june 23 about the man who traveled on fake finnish 
papers 
we assume he worked for the kgb danzinger said we have 
no information of our own that he is kgb that information came 
solely from washington 
danziger said the man whom he did not identify first visited 
vienna in 1979 and often spent weeks or months at a time in the 
austrian capital using papers issued by the finnish embassy that 
were based on a false identity bloch began his sevenyear tour at 
the us embassy in 1980 
the man who allegedly had contacts with bloch left austria 
june 11 supposedly for helsinki danzinger said 
whether bloch might have met the man in the normal course of 
diplomatic duties was not known bloch who served four years as 
deputy chief of mission had many contacts and regularly attended 
diplomatic and other parties 
danzinger said the visitor always registered with police in 
accordance with austrian regulations and had not been the object of 
suspicion until the notice from washington austrian authorities 
now believe he is the man us authorities suspect of kgb activity 
the police chief said 
in paris soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
friday his country never had any connection with bloch and im 
surprised by the fuss over this affair its not serious 
at a news conference in vienna danzinger and interior minister 
franz loeschnak said austrian security authorities were told of a 
possible spy investigation june 23 when the tip arrived about the 
man with finnish papers 
chancellor franz vranitzky said earlier this week he learned of 
the bloch investigation july 7 from us ambassador henry a 
grunwald 
loeschnak confirmed friday that bloch had a friendship with 
an austrian woman over several years danzinger said she was 
questioned this week after returning from a vacation in egypt and 
there was no evidence she had suspicions about bloch 
the interior minister said the suspect visitor to vienna also 
had a relationship with an austrian woman and the women apparently 
were not acquainted danzinger said authorities had to assume 
neither had any idea of a possible link between bloch and the 
man with finnish papers 
bloch 54 was economics chief in the vienna embassy in 198083 
then deputy chief of mission until he returned to washington in 
july 1987 he is the highestranking us diplomat ever 
investigated for espionage 
he was put on paid leave june 22 and is under constant 
surveillance by the fbi but his travel has not been restricted 
reports have said he refused to discuss any possible spying 
activities with the fbi but the new york times reported friday he 
admitted in a brief interview with the fbi on june 22 to being paid 
a lot of money by the kgb over many years 
a congressional source in washington told the associated press 
the fbi believes the kgb recruited bloch when he was stationed in 
east berlin 14 years ago 
loeschnak said preliminary austrian investigations of bloch had 
been completed and prosecutors received the report friday he said 
they would decide whether further action should be taken 
suspicions about the diplomat are the affair of the united 
states he said but we have to see whether austrian interests 
were affected 
some things have been established which indicate the activity 
of a kgb man loeschnak said but he would not say whether there 
was a direct link to bloch

bush i dont think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of 
peace 
dick 
q mr president recently your secretary of commerce announced 
that we would sell computers to the soviet union we hadnt sold 
them before which drew a protest from secretary cheney in light 
of the felix bloch case and the new allegations of possible spying 
do you think its time to begin relaxing our controls on technology 
bush i dont want to send technology to the soviet union that 
will enhance their military capabilities 
and we did have a difference inside the administration on this 
question 
i am confident that after having looked at it subsequent to 
secretary mosbachers decision that this will not enhance the 
technological wont put it this way that this will not 
endanger the legitimate national security needs of this country 
so were we have had a difference on it 
ive talked to both cheney and mosbacher 
i dont see any connection however to the allegations against 
mr bloch 
yeah bernie 
q sir how concerned are you that the bloch case will actually 
endanger national security and can you give us any indication how 
long this has been going on 
bush i cant give you the facts on it 
i dont want to go into it while it is being under investigation 
i am very disturbed about the premature discussion and 
disclosure that means leaks on this matter because i think 
you can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the mans ability 
to get a fair hearing 
so i am troubled by it but i cant really help you on the facts 
on the matter 
yes frank 
q id like to continue with this kinder gentler theme for a 
moment youve tried this with congress for the entire six months 
youve been in office yet your crime bill has failed your defense 
bill appears to have been savaged your nominee for civil rights 
post whom you say is qualified is being given a rough ride to 
say the least and the sampl bill you have great concerns about how 
would you rate your own legislative success in your first six 
months 
bush id be rating the congress wouldnt i if i rated the 
legislative success and i wouldnt give it very high marks 
i sent a savings and loan bill up there and its been there for 
aside how many days 
staff since february 23rd 
bush since february 23rd 
and i challenged the congress to get something done in 60 days 
and it wasnt done 
so in not going after people in a very personal way attacking 
some congressman or senator with whom i differ that does not mean 
i am happy or relaxed about the legislative calendar and the 
performance on legislation 
i am concerned about it 
every day the savings and loan sits out there unsolved its 
costing the american taxpayer 30 some estimates go from 10 
million to 30 million a day 
and if the fault ill take the fault the responsibility when 
were slow getting legislation up weve been criticized and i 
think properly so from on a couple of subjects not getting the 
legislation there on time 
but on this one i think the congress has been taking too long 
to resolve the matter 
and there are others 
the defense budgets not a question of timing so much as it is 
the mix on our strategic system 
so i would not give congress very high marks on doing what i 
want done on legislation 
in giving it putting their spin on it why thats something 
else

public support for the presence of 
us troops is withering but west germany would lose more than 5 
billion a year if those forces were withdrawn according to the 
german economics institute 
west germany earns more than 5 billion each year from us 
military expenditures in west germany after the costs of hosting 
the troops are deducted according to an institute report 
the institute warns of economic collapse in some regions if 
the troops are withdrawn 
an extensive analysis of the us military presence was 
undertaken because of the growing public tendency to see american 
troops as a burden said otto vogel director for economic and 
scientific affairs at the industrysupported institute 
we wanted to make an independent analysis of the costs and 
benefits that would be useful to both those in the economic sector 
and those in politics vogel said friday 
as west germans perceive a diminishing military threat from the 
soviet union public support for the more than 250000 us 
soldiers stationed in west germany has lessened 
the 5 billion figure represents only about 1 percent of the 
gross national product but the study based on official us and 
west german figures for defense and social spending said that a 
us withdrawal could trigger economic collapse in 
rhinelandpalatinate and hesse states as well as parts of bavaria 
those regions have heavy concentrations of american troops 
citing us military expenditures in 1986 the institute said 
west german companies were awarded contracts worth 345 billion 
and that another 13 billion was paid to the 171000 west german 
employees of us defense installations that year 
us soldiers also spend an average of 28 percent of their 
salaries on rent goods and services in west germany which 
accounted for another 15 billion in 1986 the study said 
the analysis did not consider the presence of thousands of 
american civilians in west germany in some natorelated role 
on the cost side the report said that in 1986 the west german 
government spent the equivalent of 991 million to host the us 
soldiers including 646 million in lost rent for land used 
costfree by the us forces 
it also mentioned losses totaling 86 million for damage to 
private property caused by us maneuvers 
the researchers said certain social costs of hosting the troops 
could not be quantified such as increased prostitution and drug 
use in areas with a heavy military presence 
researchers christian thimann and hartmut bebermeyer also noted 
that their report did not include public assistance costs for 
german wives divorced from us soldiers or children left behind 
but they concluded that the us military presence in 1986 
provided a material advantage of 125 billion marks that would 
be 539 billion at the exchange rate then in effect 
vogel said his institute conducted the study to determine the 
financial facts amid changing political and social attitudes 
toward us troops 
asked whether the report would influence public opinion he 
replied thats difficult to say but certainly having available 
an independent analysis of the economic considerations will have 
some effect on the populations attitudes 
public resentment of the us military presence especially 
lowlevel flying exercises and war games has intensified over the 
past year 
the shift in opinion was most notable after the aug 28 1988 
disaster at the us air base at ramstein where three italian jets 
collided during an aerobatic demonstration and fell in flames into 
the crowd below the accident claimed 70 lives 
there have also been suggestions in congress that efforts to cut 
costs with us base closures be extended to europe 
president bush announced at the may 2930 nato summit in 
brussels belgium that the united states would offer to withdraw 
about 30000 soldiers from europe as part of viennabased 
negotiations with the warsaw pact on conventional force reductions 
but some observers believe pressure will mount for deeper cuts 
or a fullfledged us pullout as relations between east and west 
improve 
thomas enders a us affairs expert with the german society for 
foreign policy said he could imagine a situation after a 
successful conclusion of the vienna talks when a significantly 
lower level of american troops would be appropriate 
edward harper a retired us diplomat with long service in west 
germany wrote in thursdays international herald tribune that for 
us troops in europe the time has come to go 
the advantages of such a course are immense including an 
immediate reduction in the federal budget deficit and a 
corresponding improvement to the balance of payments harper 
wrote

burmas military government said it 
freed thousands of criminals this week but diplomats said 
authorities also have arrested hundreds of political activists 
the government also has sentenced to death three opposition 
party members for a bombing at an oil refinery 
radio rangoon reported wednesday that 1187 criminals were freed 
nationwide that day bringing to 5131 the number released under an 
amnesty announced july 20 
the amnesty commuted death sentences to life imprisonment 
reduced life terms to 10 years and cut other terms cut by 
twothirds 
but the amnesty applied only to cases before sept 18 1988 and 
not to cases of high treason or breaches of martial law imposed 
since that date 
on sept 18 the army under gen saw maung moved to crush a 
nationwide mass movement for democracy killing hundreds of people 
mostly unarmed protesters he declared martial law that severely 
curtailed public gatherings and freedom of speech 
on july 18 the eve of a planned mass opposition rally the 
government tightened martial law and threatened offenders with 
death sentences 
two days later aung san suu kyi and tin oo the leaders of the 
national league for democracy were placed under house arrest the 
government charged they had attempted to destroy the military and 
create anarchy in the country 
on thursday a military tribunal sentenced to death three 
members of their party who allegedly confessed they were 
responsible for a package bomb that exploded and killed two people 
at the countrys main oil refinery on july 7 
no details of the trial of than zaw 27 moe kyaw thus 17 and 
nyi nyi oo 25 were made public 
dissidents and western diplomats in rangoon said authorities 
have arrested up to hundreds of dissidents since putting the two 
opposition leaders under house arrest 
they are going to peoples houses at night they are pulling 
them off the streets even off of buses or out of offices and 
hotels one diplomat said in a telephone interview from bangkok 
british officials say the burmese government also has restricted 
the movements of ms suu kyis british husband michael aris he 
had returned to rangoon from britain on saturday last week 
at a government news conference friday foreign minister ohn 
kyaw denied rumors that ms suu kyi had begun a hunger strike to 
protest her detention 
he said both opposition leaders are in good health in their 
respective houses 
before her arrest ms suu kyi said the suspects in the oil 
refinery bombing were members of her party but she had seen no 
evidence that implicated them 
diplomats in rangoon said thursday they were baffled by the mass 
release of criminals but speculated that the jails were being 
cleared to make way for political prisoners 
the government also released thousands of criminals during last 
years protests in a move diplomats said was designed to convince 
the people that they needed a tough army presence 
saw maung has sought to justify his rule by saying the country 
was facing anarchy

the exxon corp told congress on friday it is 
committed to any reasonable continuation of the alaska oil 
spill cleanup next spring president bush said he would do his best 
to make sure exxon doesnt pull back on an agreement 
exxon officials testified the company intends to suspend cleanup 
activities in september because of oncoming winter weather and 
would return to see if more work is necessary in the spring 
but a top us coast guard official said he expects 
disagreements on what should be done next year with no clear 
consensus on how free of oil the stretches of rocky alaska shore 
must be before being declared clean 
exxons plans in the cleanup of more than 700 miles of 
shoreline damaged by the exxon valdez tanker spill last march 
came under scrutiny this week with the disclosure of an internal 
company memorandum which said no commitment should be made on 
the timing of suspending or resuming cleanup operations 
asked by reporters about the matter at a white house news 
conference friday hours after exxon officials testified on 
capitol hill bush made clear he considers exxon to have made a 
commitment to stay with the cleanup 
if i had the feeling exxon was going to pull back on an 
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement theyd made with us with 
the government or with the state of alaska i would be very much 
exercised and try my best to do something about it said the 
president 
alaska officials publicly interpreted the july 19 exxon memo as 
an indication the company was preparing to pull out of a cleanup 
effort that was far from completed the brouhaha prompted fridays 
hearing by the interior subcommittee on water power and offshore 
energy resources during which exxon was asked to detail its 
intentions 
the memo written by the manager of exxons cleanup operation in 
alaska suggests exxon is putting together its plan for 
demobilization without coast guard approval said rep george 
miller dcalif chairman of the subcommittee 
wd stevens president of exxon co usa said the wording of 
the memo was unfortunate 
he said the company will withdraw its equipment and estimated 
10000 workers from the contaminated region beginning sept 15 
because of potential safety problems with rough seas and weather 
but he said exxon would return to the areas in the spring of 1990 
to reinspect the area to assure that the job has been properly 
done and if not to put it right 
pressed by miller on whether exxon plans to resume cleanup 
operations in the spring stevens said he could not give an 
unequivocal commitment and added i think it would be naive to 
do that 
we will follow through on any reasonable request that is made 
by the us coast guard said stevens adding that there likely 
will be scientific disagreement over what areas are clean and 
whether further work is needed 
coast guard vice admiral clyde lusk told the subcommittee that a 
working group of federal and state officials as well as various 
scientists and representatives from exxon will participate in the 
inspection next spring 
but lusk acknowledged that while the coast guard can ask exxon 
to perform additional cleanup at a specific site it has no 
authority to require the company to do so 
i have absolutely no doubt there are going to be disagreements 
over what should be done in terms of continuing the cleanup 
efforts he said 
what is clean lusk asked rhetorically at another point i 
dont know how were going to make that decision 
the potential for sharp disagreement over when a stretch of 
shoreline should be considered cleaned became evident at fridays 
hearing 
exxon executives contended that about 600 miles of contaminated 
shoreline already had been treated while alaskas chief 
environmental official put the number at about 190 miles and said 
in many cases oil has seeped back into the rocks and pebbles 
we cannot imagine how exxon can conclude 600 miles have been 
treated dennis kelso the commissioner of alaskas department of 
environmental conservation told the house panel if that 
statement were made in kodiak or homer the roof would rise maybe 
theyre looking at a different gulf

striking musicians picketing ballys hotel and 
casino for using taped music in lieu of live musicians have forced 
dean martin to cancel his act there indefinitely 
martin had been scheduled to open a weeklong engagement at 
ballys on thursday night it was the first time a strip headliner 
has been affected in the twomonth dispute between hotels and 
musicians picketing continued friday

live music to taped numbers for their production show jubilee 
thursday night 
several las vegas hotels that feature lavish production shows 
have announced they are dropping live music for some production 
numbers name stars still use live musicians 
ballys announced earlier this summer that it was cutting out 
live music for the jubilee show but would continue using musicians 
for headliners such as martin appearing in the hotels celebrity 
showroom 
however celebrity room musicians joined the picket lines to 
support colleagues who lost their jobs in the jubilee changeover 
martin said he was upset by the strike 
for over 35 years ive played las vegas always utilizing las 
vegas musicians martin said in a statement thursday at no 
time has ballys ever asked me to perform without live musicians 
im saddened by the musicians union strike which occurred today at 
ballys and by the effect it has had on many people any time 
people are out of work it is personally upsetting 
cancellation of the show left 86 people out of work 23 
musicians who would have played for martin and 63 other union 
members who work in the celebrity room as stagehands and food 
service employees 
the musicians previously struck the tropicana hotel when that 
resort switched from live music to tape for its folies bergere 
show and the union set up informational pickets at the flamingo 
hilton earlier this week when that resort switched from live music 
to tape for its city lites show 
the switch from live to taped music directly affected 45 union 
musicians 19 at ballys and 13 each at the tropicana and flamingo

a former deputy prime minister said friday he did 
not want the job of prime minister improving the chances of the 
governing partys no 2 leader an unusually young politician 
untainted by japans recent scandals 
the governing liberal democratic party whose president becomes 
prime minister due to a comfortable majority in lower house 
decided friday to choose a new leader aug 8 and seek his approval 
in parliament aug 10 party officials said 
ryutaro hashimoto who at 51 is the youngest secretary general 
of the liberal democratic party and is in charge of finding a 
replacement for prime minister sousuke uno has said little about 
his possible candidacy 
on friday however former deputy prime minister shin kanemaru 
75 who had been viewed as opposing hashimoto said he had no 
intention to be prime minister 
hashimotos chances were bolstered further when former finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa who controls the thirdlargest faction in 
the party also said he prefered to have an young and 
progressive person to head the party and the government 
the conservative liberal democrats have worked quickly to 
minimize the political vacuum created by unos decision to step 
down to take responsibility for sundays election defeat in which 
the conservative party lost control of the 252member upper house 
of parliament for the first time in 34 years 
hashimoto declined to comment about his candidacy because i 
am in a position to help the party to select the next president 
for decades japans prime ministers have been men in their 
mid60s or older who reached the office after a steady 
apprenticeship through a succession of increasingly important 
cabinet and party posts hashimoto in parliament since he was 26 
has not held top cabinet posts such as the finance portfolio and 
he became party secretary general only in june 
untainted by scandal hashimoto was the most active campaigner 
for july 23 election making 90 appearances during the 14day 
campaign while uno stayed in the background 
uno was virtually handpicked by former prime minister noboru 
takeshita behind closed doors after takeshita resigned to take 
responsibility for a widespread influencepeddling scandal that 
touched much of the partys top leadership 
the real key is to make the process of selecting the next 
prime minster as transparent as possible hashimoto said in an 
interview 
whoever becomes party leader and prime minister will have to be 
in effect reconfirmed in october when the term as party leader 
expires 
the party is working to find a candidate strong and popular 
enough to be reelected unanimously in the fall hashimoto said 
this time around we are aware we have to have a new leader 
whose leadership can been forseen in longer terms he said uno 
had been seen as a caretaker leader lacking a power base within 
the party 
meanwhile officials of the japan socialist party which seeks 
to form a coalition with three small centrist parties against the 
governing party said it would ask them to support socialist 
chairwoman takako doi in the prime ministerial election in 
parliament 
an opposition party official speaking anonymously said the 
negotiations for a common candidate have to overcome many 
hurdles before reaching an agreement 
analysts said opposition parties are unlikely to come up with 
one common candidate because of policy gaps among themselves but 
they have a good chance to force the governing party into agreeing 
to early elections for the more powerful lower house before its 
fouryear term ends in july 1990

garlic normally considered a good way to 
keep others from getting too close has drawing power in these 
parts where the 11th annual festival got under way friday with 
150000 visitors expected for the weekend 
highlights include 80 food booths dishing up everything from 
garliclaced vegetarian chili to garlicflavored ice cream 
the celebration of the stinking rose was expected to 
generate whooper traffic jams as folks traveled long distances to 
sample the delicacies and shop the wares of dozens of artisans 
for the third year organizers hoped to reduce the vehicular 
nightmare by operating the garlic express a shuttle train 
originating in san francisco about 60 miles north 
but for those who prefer to soar over the crowd of stalled 
drivers and fly into the san martin municipal airport local pilot 
jean blake 67 planned to help flyers get to the party 
im going to do what i can said blake 
gilroy claimed the title of garlic capital of the world when it 
threw the first festival in 1979 but an irony of the celebration 
is that gilroy now produces only a small portion of the states 
garlic crop according to mike henry a spokesman for the

q do you think this is just harbinger of things to come a 
republican president working with a democratic congress converts 
notwithstanding 
bush nobody ever said it would be easy 
yeah 
q mr president 
bush in this department 
q on a related matter there are some fairly intense 
negotiations on your capital gains tax cut proposal going on right 
now are you willing to accept some kind of an indexing of capital 
gains rather than the cut youve asked for as an alternate that 
might be more acceptable to democrats 
bush look what i want to do is see capital income at different 
rates 
i want whats known as the differential 
and so lets see what can be worked out 
if theres some compromise that can spur investment spur jobs 
increase employment the cause of new jobs starting up id be 
interested in it 
and so i want to see what could be worked out 
i dont think i should ever say its got to be done just this 
way in terms of the bills up there in the house ways and means 
committee right now 
but i have a good sound proposal and it was tested it was 
one of the things i think that was clearly in focus in the 
campaign 
and the other side particularly the liberal democrats 
particularly attacked me as having some kind of a tax favoring the 
rich 
its nothing like that at all 
it will stimulate jobs 
it will encourage business small business creation 
and i stand for it

microprocessing technology to hitachi over a 10year period 
problems started when hitachi introduced its zero turnaround 
time microprocessors in 1986 which motorola claims use technology 
not covered in their agreements 
in its statement the us company indicated its intention to 
continue its suit against hitachi which goes to trial oct 23 
motorola is seeking an injunction against continued sales of 
hitachi h8 and h16 processors in the united states as well as

intelligence agency but said he has no choice but to comply 
said reports 
also friday newspapers reported that im sukyong a radical 
student illegally visiting north korea has started a hunger strike 
at the border village of panmunjom 
ms im arrived at the border thursday with pacifists from a 
reported 30 countries and is demanding that she reenter the south

unification 
the government says she will be arrested on her return and 
charged with violating national security 
in seoul the agency for national security planning said 
thursday it will serve kim with a warrant for questioning about an

yonhap south koreans official news agency said kim told 
reporters friday in the provincial capital of kwangju that the

and wipe out the party by taking advantage of the suh kyungwon 
case the opposition leader said friday 
we have fought to establish a foundation for democratization 
in this country we will not surrender to the politics of a

israeli commandos on friday kidnapped a 
shiite moslem clergyman reputed to be a leader of the proiranian 
hezbollah and allegedly linked to the kidnapping of a us marine 
held hostage in lebanon 
security sources speaking on condition of anonymity suggested 
sheik abdul karim obeid may have been kidnapped in a swap for the 
american lt col william r higgins or for three israeli 
soldiers captured in south lebanon more than three years ago 
president bush said he did not know if the incident would help 
higgins or the other eight american hostages but added i dont 
think kidnapping and violence helps the cause of peace in the 
middle east 
the israeli army confirmed the incident and accused obeid 33 
of instigating attacks on israel and of being a major hezbollah 
figure 
an israel army spokesman col raanan gissin indicated a swap 
was possible clearly when you capture one of their hezbollahs 
top leaders it can deter terrorism and you also have a certain 
amount of leverage in your hands he said 
gissin said obeid and two assistants seized with him were 
safely in israeli hands and undergoing questioning 
killed in the overnight raid was at least one resident of the 
village of jibchit about 20 miles from the israeli border and 35 
miles south of beirut 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the united 
states was not consulted about or involved in the abduction 
lebanese police said the commandos entered jibchit about 130 
am after landing in a helicopter outside town 
a police official speaking on condition of anonymity in line 
with standing regulations said about 12 commandos with 
silencerequipped pistols surrounded obeids building then knocked 
on the door of his apartment and forced their way in 
they fled with obeid his cousin ahmed obeid and a friend 
majid fahs the spokesman said 
obdeids wife mona was locked in a room with her hands tied 
and her mouth taped shut the spokesman said 
mrs obeid interviewed later said one of the attackers spoke 
arabic he told me he would kill me if i yelled she said 
the israeli military refused to give details of the raid but 
israel television reported the commandos blew offthe front door of 
obeids apartment with plastic explosives and whisked the three men 
away in a helicopter in less than a halfhour 
lebanese police said a neighbor hussein abu zeid opened the 
door of his apartment to find out what was happening and was shot 
to death israel radio said the man killed was a bodyguard for 
obeid 
another neighbor fayez shokor who lives across the street from 
obeid said three helicopters were involved in the operation 
i heard a suspicious noise and went out to the balcony i 
heard someone shouting in arabic kill me i wont go with 
you said shokor a member of the mainstream amal militia which 
has been fighting hezbollah for control of lebanons shiite moslems 
shokor said he and five other amal militiamen rushed to a nearby 
valley in search of obeid but came under israeli fire 
two israeli helicopters hovered overhead and they started 
shooting at us with machine guns he said as the clash was 
under way a third helicopter took off apparently carrying the 
israelis sheik obeid and his companions 
irans foreign ministry said in a statement this shameless 
act by the zionist regime will not remain unanswered by the moslem 
and combatant forces the statement carried by the official 
islamic republic news agency said the operation was a clear 
example of state terrorism 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god urged moslems to 
let out their anger until obeid is released safely 
obeid is reputed to be the spiritual guide of hezbollah in south 
lebanon he has denied involvement with the fundamentalist group 
believed to be an umbrella for the kidnappers of 17 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
higgins 44 of danville ky headed an observer group attached 
to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon security sources 
said he was briefly held at obeids apartment after his abduction 
near the southern port city of tyre on feb 17 1988 
his captors the organization of the oppressed on earth 
believed to be one of hezbollahs affiliates later took higgins to 
another hideout 
the state department and israel described obeid as a hezbollah 
member 
britain which has three citizens held hostage in lebanon said 
the raid could hurt the hostages but gissin said it would help 
them 
we believe hezbollah leaders will now think twice before 
harming their hostages he said 
two israeli soldiers rahamim alsheikh and yossi fink were 
captured feb 17 1986 when guerrillas ambushed their patrol in 
israels selfproclaimed security zone in south lebanon 
israeli officials said they believe hezbollah was behind the 
kidnapping 
an air force navigator ron arad was captured by shiite 
militiamen on october 16 1986 when his plane was shot down in 
south lebanon 
the american held longest in lebanon is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 a shiite moslem group the proiranian 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war claims to hold him

a soviet ship on friday turned over to amazed coast 
guard officials three sunburned cubans fleeing their communist 
homeland on a flimsy raft 
this is a first for us said coast guard spokesman luis 
diaz it went very well we had no trouble with the exchange 
this is not a common occurrence and we were very happy to take the 
men 
the three refugees were badly sunburned dehydrated and had 
difficulty talking and walking after their sixday 125mile voyage 
that relied on atlantic currents to push them to florida 
they are safely being attended by paramedics and glad to be 
free diaz said as the men were brought ashore all three were 
taken to jackson memorial hospital and still were being evaluated 
at midafternoon 
coast guard petty officer veronica cady could not explain why 
the soviets would surrender the cubans instead of taking them home 
the soviet ship identified in the reference book janes 
fighting ships as an intelligencegathering zaporozhye spotted the 
three floating in a raft made of inner tubes and picked them up 
friday morning 26 miles southeast of cape florida the coast guard 
said 
the negotiations were very short and brief diaz said we 
were notified by the soviet warship that they had picked up the 
three men and they wanted to transfer them over to us 
when the 274foot soviet ship rendezvoused with a 41foot coast 
guard patrol boat for the transfer the soviet captain refused to 
allow a coast guard party to board the cubans were transferred by 
raft to the patrol boat for their trip to miami 
so far this year the coast guard has picked up 97 cubans on 
rafts including 31 this month alone 
the refugees identified themselves as arsenio gomez hernandez 
46 his son pedro gomez cruz and a man who said he was 47 and gave 
the name gomez

transferred to the custody of the immigration and naturalization 
service and released to relatives after questioning 
the ship the soviets first with onboard intelligence 
capability has been operating for several months off cape 
canaveral on intelligence collection operations said us navy lt

yeah john mashek 
q mr president when sen phil gramm of your adopted state 
resigned his house seat he he switched parties and resigned his 
seat have you advised congressman robinson that that would be the 
noble thing to do to see if the voters approve of that conversion 
you just announced 
bush well i dont know that he needs any advice from me just 
like phil didnt seek any from me in that regard 
but you can ask him the question if you want 
q congressman do you plan to offer yourself for election as a 
republican 
robinson that sounds like a typical democratic question 
the press awwww laughter 
robinson let me say this i represent 550000 people in the 2nd 
district of arkansas democrats republicans independents and 
people quite frankly that dont care about any of the three above 
we have no party registration in arkansas 
republicans vote for me democrats independents the like 
i am not going to resign 
im going to be a good republican congressman over the rest of 
this session of congress and work very hard for president bush 
q mr president airline passengers would like to see the dc10 
planes grounded in the wake of that accident in sioux city there 
have been other concerns about hydraulic problems with planes are 
you concerned at all about the safety of our fleet and do you have 
any an opinion about the grounding of the dc10s 
bush i dont have an opinion about the grounding but any time 
there are accidents of this nature you are concerned 
the safety board is doing a thorough investigation obviously 
on the flight coming out of colorado 
and the i expect the department of transportation has taken a 
hard look at this in the light of the two recent happenings 
but i dont really cant really give you a judgment as to 
whether i personally feel that the answer at this juncture is the 
grounding of this fleet 
yeah saul then dan 
q yes on the flag desecration bill there was testimony in the 
judiciary committee that however you word it such a constitutional 
amendment would make an exception for the first time in 200 years 
to the first amendment i wonder if you have any misgivings about 
the possibility that you may be weakening the first amendment 
bush i thought about it saul because you dont want to i 
dont want to weaken anything 
but i feel so strongly that a narrowly that a very carefully 
drawn amendment can solve this problem that i dont worry about 
it because i also fall back on the fact that the founding fathers 
did provide for the amendment process 
and but its not a i mean i dont have disrespect for those 
who want to find a different answer 
the thing that i think is heartening is that theres a wide 
array of support for doing something about this question people 
that have maybe in the past not been identified as i got to be 
over some years you know in this department 
but there so i dont question motives on this one 
but i know what i think is right and i know what our attorneys 
have advised me is right given the recent supreme court decision

turkish cypriot authorities on friday 
freed eight greek cypriot men detained for nine days after they 
protested in the unpoliced buffer zone splitting this 
mediterranean island 
the last two people among 108 arrested during the demonstration 
greek orthodox bishop chrysostomos of larnaca and father giorgios 
papachrysostomou remained jailed in the northern turkishoccupied 
sector after refusing to pay fines 
the detentions have triggered a political crisis that has 
aggravated sectarian tensions and delayed a round of reunification 
talks between the greek and turkish cypriot leaders 
the 10 men were arrested july 19 with 98 women when turkish 
cypriot riot police and soldiers burst into a church the protesters 
were occupying on the green line dividing cyprus 
the women who staged the demonstration to mark the 15th 
anniversary of a turkish invasion in 1974 have been released 
the eight men freed on friday were taken from a jail in the 
turkishheld zone and driven to the village of astromeritis 12 
miles west of nicosia where they were handed over to united 
nations soldiers 
the men unshaven and several wearing torn shirts linked arms 
and sang a byzantine hymn and the greek national anthem as 
relatives crowded around them 
we were horribly treated at first beaten and threatened i 
was made to stand on one leg blindfolded while they questioned 
me said dr andreas constantinides a surgeon who was providing 
medical aid for the protesters 
parliament speaker vassos lyssarides standing in for president 
george vassiliou who was on a visit to greece welcomed them on 
behalf of the government 
the protesters were sentenced on saturday last week to three 
days in jail on charges of entering the selfproclaimed republic of 
northern cyprus without permission and through an illegal gateway 
the eight men released friday were detained an additional five 
days after they refused to pay a fine of 100 each the bishop and 
priest were expected to remain in jail until thursday of next week 
because they refused to pay 200 each in fines none of the women 
was fined 
the turkish cypriots arrested the protesters even though they 
were inside the green line area because they said the zone even if 
demilitarized was still part of the breakaway state the buffer 
zone recently was expanded to include the church when greek and 
turkish cypriot forces agreed to pull back a bit in certain areas 
of nicosia as a confidencebuilding measure 
vassiliou said he was willing to go to reunifications talks set 
for wednesday but the talks were called off when turkish cypriot 
leader rauf denktash decided not to attend the closeddoor session 
was to be held at the home of un special representative oscar 
camilion 
the negotiations on a un blueprint for reuniting the island as 
a twozone federation are expected to resume next week but no date 
has been set 
greek cypriots staged marches and demonstrations in nicosia to 
press for the detainees release women protesters were holding a 
sitin that blocked the main entrance to the un peacekeeping 
forces headquarters in the buffer zone 
cyprus has been divided since the turks seized the northern 
third of the island after a shortlived coup by supporters of union 
with greece the turkish cypriots who make up about 17 percent of 
the population declared their own republic in 1983 but only turkey 
recognizes it 
the un peacekeepers have been in cyprus since sectarian 
fighting erupted in 1963 the 2300man force now patrols the 
112mile buffer zone known as the green line that zigzags across 
the island

communist party leaders met friday to 
discuss plans for a fall congress to unite their divided ranks and 
find attractive policies to win back waning support before 
competitive elections next year 
the meeting comes three days after party general secretary 
karoly grosz and chairman rezsoe nyers two of four members running 
the party until the congress held talks in moscow on hungarys 
future 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev appeared to endorse 
hungarys move to a multiparty system telling the hungarians that 
socialist nations are searching for ways to create a society of 
free people masters of their lives and countries 
hungarys mti news agency said the partys central committee 
convened friday and added that the congress would open oct 6 a 
day earlier than scheduled to accommodate a large number of 
speakers it did not specify the duration of the meeting 
state tv reported that the reform circles a network of 
reformoriented party members would hold a separate national 
congress sept 13 
there has been speculation over the possibility of a split 
within the party but reformists have so far sought to maneuver 
within the organization 
mti quoted central committee secretary jenoe kovacs as saying 
there would be 1300 delegates to the congress 
the choice of delegates due aug 25 is considered crucial to 
the program and new leadership the congress is to endorse to try to 
boost the partys waning popularity ahead of multiparty elections 
they will be hungarys first free general elections since 1947 
the budapest meeting comes as polands communist party central 
committee holds crucial talks to decide its future after a similar 
experiment led to devastating election defeats poles 
overwhelmingly supported independent solidarityled candidates 
mti also reported that negotiations for a timetable and 
framework for hungarian elections encountered setbacks thursday 
the party and democratic opposition failed to agree on how to 
divide the property of the communist party and arrange financial 
support for competing parties 
mti said the party insisted at closeddoor talks that its 
extensive property does not belong to the people as the opposition 
argued 
the opposition wants a moratorium on sales of party property 
after the communists recently sold some buildings and suggested it 
be divided up so the party enjoy no unfair financial or 
organizational advantages going into the elections 
hungarian opposition activists have complained that in a 
staterun economy it is hard for them to find property and install 
such basic necessities as telephone lines to enable them to compete 
with the communists 
the two sides also split over whether or not parties should 
operate at workplaces as the communists have done in the past mti 
said 
no date was announced for the next negotiations the slowmoving 
talks have yet to bring agreement on key points such as an election 
date and access to the media 
the daily newspaper magyar nemzet quoted unidentified sources as 
saying the absence of imre pozsgay the communist partys leading 
reformer and a member of the fourman leadership was palpably 
felt at thursdays talks pozsgay is on vacation the daily said 
in his absence a more conservative member of the party 
negotiating team gyoergy fejti tried to renege on previous 
agreements it reported

the communist leadership deeply 
split along regional lines is to blame for the slide into a 
nationalist precipice the official tanjug news agency said 
friday 
relations between yugoslavias ethnic groups have reached the 
lowest point in the postwar period tanjug said in an unsually 
blunt commentary as the communist partys central committee 
prepared for a meeting devoted to ethnic and nationalist tensions 
the meeting scheduled to open sunday and last for two days is 
being convened after a twomonth delay during which the quarrelsome 
leaders of yugoslavias republics tried to compromise on 
nationalistic differences 
the leadership in serbia the countrys largest and most 
populous republic on thursday attacked a draft declaration that 
will be taken up at the twoday committee meeting 
the declaration calls on the party to oppose all forms of 
nationalist discrimination including increasingly frequent 
demands for privileged treatment of larger nationalities at the 
expense of small ones 
in a statement serbias leadership branded the draft 
unacceptable because of its implication that serbs sought a 
privileged position within yugoslavia the leaderships of 
slovenia and croatia welcomed the draft as a good basis for 
discussion 
according to official statistics serbs make up about 40 percent 
of yugoslavias 23 million citizens while croats account for 20 
percent and slovenes for less than 10 percent macedonians 
montenegrins moslems ethnic albanians and several other 
minorities comprise the rest 
croatia and slovenia have traditionally been wary of what they 
claim are serbian attempts to dominate yugoslavia economically and 
politically serbs deny this contending that strong separatist and 
nationalist tendencies exist in both northern republics 
yugoslavias wealthiest regions 
what can the central committee and the communist party as a 
whole do to stop the slide into a nationalist precipice 
asked the tanjug commentary the geopolitically divided 
quarrelsome and confederalized party and its leaderships have 
themselves contributed decisively to the drastic worsening of 
ethnic tensions 
during the past month news media have reported a spate of 
nationalist incidents in various parts of the country 
particularly in resorts along the countrys adriatic coastline 
most of those resorts are in croatia 
the incidents usually involving brawls between local croats and 
serb tourists started after about 50000 serbs chanting 
nationalist slogans staged a mass rally in western croatia at the 
beginning of july 
in the past year the leaderships and media of the different 
regions have waged an allout propaganda feud over ways to overcome 
yugoslavias worst economic and social crisis 
the country a loose federation of six republics and two 
autonomous provinces is burdened with a 21 billion foreign debt 
a 700 percent annual inflation rate and stagnating economic growth 
the living standard has been in steep decline since 1980 and 
yugoslavia whose economic growth rate was second only to japans 
in the 1970s now has trouble manufacturing export products that 
measure up to western standards 
the communist leaderships of the republics divided between 
reformers and hardliners have been unable to agree on whether to 
introduce an open freemarket economy and greater political 
freedoms as a way out of the crisis

the government on friday promised a thorough 
investigation of a report from the main un refugee organization 
alleging police brutality toward detained vietnamese seeking asylum 
neither the government nor the united nations high commissioner 
for refugees would disclose details of the report un officials 
have said previously however that it would focus on a disturbance 
at a detention center in which more than 100 vietnamese boat people 
were injured 
authorities say the violence at the sek kong enter began sunday 
when some of the vietnamese detained there hurled stones at police 
guards trying to prevent escapes through holes cut in fencing 
around the camp the unrest flared again several hours later 
the camp holds 7000 of the 50000 vietnamese languishing in 
this british colony after fleeing their communist homeland by boat 
police said only four vietnamese requested treatment for 
injuries after the incident including three who said they were 
hurt accidentally 
the un report also was expected to contain allegations of 
previous incidents of police violence at sek kong and other 
detention centers 
in response to the report a government statement said officials 
were taking the complaints very seriously and all allegations 
against the government staff concerned will be fully and swiftly 
investigated 
police already are investigating the case of a 59yearold 
vietnamese man who died the night of the sek kong disturbance an 
autopsy showed the man did not die of natural causes but no 
details have been released 
the vietnamese at sek kong are among the boat people who must 
prove they fled political persecution or face repatriation 
local news media have reported growing tension in the detention 
centers amid signs that britain and vietnam are near agreement on a 
program of forcefully repatriating boat people who do not qualify 
as refugees

president bush on friday predicted victory for 
his military priorities on capitol hill despite a series of defeats 
this week when the house demolished his defense spending proposals 
i think we will prevail for most of what we want the 
president said standing behind the costly strategic defense 
initiative popularly known as star wars and the b2 stealth 
bomber as key components of his strategic concept 
funds for those two systems along with bushs request for the 
mx rail missile and the singlewarhead midgetman missile were 
reduced or cut out completely in the housepassed version of the 
defense authorization bill on thursday 
i am disappointed that the house did what they did bush 
said he noted that the lawmakers restored money for some of the 
systems that he and defense secretary dick cheney advocated cutting 
out yesterday was not the houses most memorable moment but 
were going to keep fighting on for what we believe in he said 
bush made the comments at a wideranging news conference that he 
called to spotlight the switch by rep tommy robinson of arkansas 
from the democratic to the republican party 
the president also expressed confidence he would prevail with 
his multibilliondollar bailout plan for the savings amp loan 
industry even though house and senate negotiators this week agreed 
on a plan that rejects a key funding mechanism he has insisted on 
touching on other areas in which he is encountering rough 
sledding in congress the president 
staunchly defended his embattled nominee to head the justice 
departments civil rights division william lucas 
said he still wants a constitutional amendment to ban burning 
of the american flag but i will see what comes down in 
congressional legislation that democrats say would do the same 
thing the house judiciary committee this week approved the 
legislation and blocked consideration of a constitutional amendment 
said he is willing to see what can be worked out on 
cutting the capital gains tax his proposal has encountered 
substantial democratic opposition as a boon to the rich i dont 
think i should ever say its got to be done just this way in terms 
of the bills up there in the house ways and means committee right 
now he said 
asked about the legislative roadblocks that have met several of 
his proposals on capitol hill bush said nobody ever said it 
would be easy 
i would not give congress very high marks he added 
but he said he did not want to engage in inflammatory rhetoric 
because with democratic majorities in both the senate and house 
i have to work with these people 
its a question of style i think ill take a shot at them 
once in a while if they get too outrageous he said 
on defense spending bush said his own proposals already 
included cuts in star wars spending and we dont need further 
cuts in sdi 
the house chopped 18 billion from his request for 49 billion 
the president said he needs the solid strategic program he 
has proposed in part because it strengthens his hand in arms 
control talks with the soviet union i do not want to negotiate 
with the soviet union without as many cards in my hand as possible 
so theres an arms control dimension to what were talking about 
too 
on other topics the president 
said he was very concerned about premature discussion and 
disclosure that means leaks about the case of felix s bloch 
the us diplomat suspected of spying for the soviets because i 
think you can jeopardize the case itself and perhaps the mans 
ability to get a fair hearing 
acknowledged his advisers disagreed over allowing the export 
of small personal computers to the soviet union with defense 
secretary cheney opposed to it because of potential security 
applications but bush said he supported the commerce department 
decision to allow the exports which will not endanger the 
legitimate national security needs of this country 
said he did not condone the kidnapping of a shiite moslem 
leader by israeli commandos in lebanon and doesnt know if the act 
could lead to freedom for an american hostage 
expressed frustration over the us inability so far to get 
panamanian ruler manuel noriega out of power he said i wish i 
could give you a much clearer answer that there is some plan that 
is going to solve this problem in the way it must be solved he 
spoke of the diplomatic effort by the organization of american 
states as a sign of some hope to resolve the situation 
refused to respond directly to harsh criticisms leveled by 
outgoing customs commissioner william von raab who said he saw a 
lack of commitment or interest in the departments of state and 
treasury on fighting the drug war bush said the real question was 
how do we do better and that nothing would be gained by 
going around assigning blame to people that are trying hard

president bush said friday he felt confident 
senate republicans would block democrats from adding the 
multibilliondollar cost of the savings and loan bailout to the 
budget deficit 
house and senate negotiators reached agreement late thursday on 
landmark legislation that would cost 166 billion over 10 years to 
close and rescue hundreds of failed sampls sweepingly overhaul the 
regulatory bureaucracy and impose tough new financial standards on 
the industry 
however bush wants to keep 50 billion of the spending out of 
the budget deficit in the next three years he objects to the 
democratic plan which would balloon the reported deficit while at 
the same time waiving the grammrudman deficitreduction law to 
avoid automatic spending cuts 
the package next goes to the full house where a vote is 
expected wednesday or thursday and then to the full senate before 
congress recesses aug 5 for vacation 
senate rules permit 41 senators to block any waiver of the 
grammrudman law and bush predicted at a news conference his 
position would prevail 
sen phil gramm rtexas chief sponsor of the deficitcutting 
law has already collected signatures from 40 other republicans 
vowing to support the president on the issue 
it wont come to vetoing because we have fortyplus votes 
in the senate that staying firm will see our proposal prevail 
bush said the house as you know has disagreed with us but im 
confident that we will do all right on that one 
gramm at a separate news conference said the democratic plan 
by waiving grammrudman would destroy the spending discipline 
imposed by the law 
the problem with this sham is that next week we could do the 
same thing for the nuclear cleanup education the war on 
drugs and pretty soon we would have a balanced budget where the 
deficit was 300 billion or 400 billion he said 
unless god palsies my voice i intend stand up and raise a 
budget point of order under the grammrudman law against this 50 
billion increase in the budget deficit he said 
democrats however argue that their plan will reduce the cost 
of borrowing sampl money they say both plans evade grammrudman but 
theirs has the virtue of more honestly accounting for the spending 
the bill provides funding onbudget a provision that will 
ensure that the facts about the cost will be laid clearly 
before the american people said rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
chairman of the house banking committee 
he said gramm by holding up money badly needed to rescue failed 
sampls risks political damage in texas where about half the 
industrys losses are concentrated 
if mr gramm or i or anyone else were seen as obstructionist 
we would have to face public indignation gonzalez told a third 
news conference 
his senate counterpart sen donald w riegle jr dmich 
noted at the same briefing that sampl losses are accumulating at 20 
million a day and urged gramm and bush not stand in the way of 
swift resolution of the crisis 
he argued that bush except for the financing mechanism 
received virtually everything else he requested when he first 
outlined the administrations proposal six months ago 
we ought not to get tangled up in parliamentary maneuvers at 
this point i would hope the administration would take a very 
close look at what we have done here weve given president bush 
his plan in every essential detail riegle said 
gramm however said democrats not republicans are delaying 
the legislation he said he warned in early june he would block 
their funding plan on the senate floor but they adopted it anyway 
quite frankly we are engaged in a game of chicken it was not 
a game i sought he said

denunciations of josef stalin and other soviet 
leaders are a prelude to open attacks on lenin and the bolshevik 
revolution itself a critic of president mikhail s gorbachev says 
in a letter published in a magazine 
the letter from nina andreyeva a 51yearold leningrad 
chemistry teacher also said political reforms initiated by 
gorbachev are being used for personal gains by opponents of the 
communist party 
her letter was published in the july issue of the conservative 
monthly young guard 
she said attacks on stalin and other soviet leaders are only a 
screen to camouflage a gathering of forces for the beginning 
attacks on lenin marxismleninism the october revolution and the 
victory of the ussr in the great patriotic war world war ii 
it is hard for many people to see where the plurality of 
opinion ends and open jeering at everything sacred begins she 
said 
since gorbachev initiated a policy of glasnost or openness 
after coming to power in 1985 figures such as dictator josef 
stalin and the corrupt leonid i brezhnev have been denounced 
publicly 
in march 1988 a letter from mrs andreyeva defending stalin was 
published by the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya setting off a storm 
of controversy and worrying liberals that glasnost might be ending 
some soviet observers said that letter was sponsored by 
conservative politburo member yegor ligachev ligachev who remains 
on the politburo but has since slipped from his no 2 position 
also has complained that glasnost goes too far in uncovering past 
mistakes and failing to praise past achievements 
a month later the communist party newspaper pravda castigated 
sovietskaya rossiya for printing the letter and the reprimanded 
newspaper admitted it had been irresponsible 
in her latest letter mrs andreyeva questions gorbachevs 
program of perestroika or reconstruction of the political and 
economic structure of the country 
i have been getting mail from everywhere and people are 
wondering why we are restructuring socialism for years we have 
been talking about perestroika more than actually working on it 
she wrote 
she assailed reformist historians roy medvedev and yuri 
afanasyev 
medvedev has published almost 30 books in the west without 
even disturbing dust accumulated on archive files she said 
afanasyev has surprised even foreign antisoviets by condensed 
statements and assessments that heap ignominy on the soviet order 
and are insulting to our people 
mrs andreyeva said sensational revelations by the historians 
lead not only to their popularity with the public at large but 
also to an impressive financial wellbeing 
she said opponents of the communist party are using perestroika 
and glasnost to further their own means 
while communists campaigned in the march election using methods 
of socialist democracy opponents armed themselves with 
parliamentary methods of bourgeois democracy which as is well 
known are not characterized by decency or nobleness she said 
she said unofficial groups are amassing large amounts of money 
from the black market to push for legality in the country where the 
communist party is the only legal political party 
fed by millions of rubles from the shadow economy they are 
striving to become legal they lead to an aggravation of 
interethnic relations and stimulate the growth of nationalism 
which is finding an awesome expression in tendencies toward 
separatism which leads to tragedies and appeals for secession from 
the ussr mrs andreyeva said 
she called for a return to earlier values 
socialism though far from being perfect is a fact of our 
life she said

q mr president 
bush but i dont and i also would say i dont think this 
does violation to the constitution of the united states 
if i did i wouldnt be making this proposal 
dan and then ann 
q mr president if i could follow on capital gains if the 
goal is to generate new investment and jobs why not design the tax 
so that it only applies to new investment and longterm investment 
rather than providing a windfall to people who already hold assets 
bush because it it i think there are also revenue aspects 
of it so when you turn over in accordance with this capital gains 
proposal youre actually going to increase revenues to the federal 
government as happened when the steiger amendment was passed 
so its not a revenue loser 
yes 
q mr president without discussing the specifics of the bloch 
case could you tell us whether you would support random 
polygraphs or some other increased security measures to lessen the 
possibility that this might happen in the future or that espionage 
might happen in the future 
bush well when i was head of the intelligence community i 
supported the polygraph program there in cia 
im not sure that it needs to be extended to other agencies 
i am one who is very concerned about the security implications 
of this and but i polygraphing regrettably has taken on a 
concept of being against somebodys rights like drug testing in a 
sense 
and i think its got to be very careful because you want 
whatever program you have to be effective you dont want to 
discourage good people from signing up 
but i havent rethought my position if thats the question 
in the wake of the allegations against mr bloch 
in the middle over here 
q mr president 
bush im getting the hook put on me 
two more 
once twice right in the middle 
q customs commisioner von raab has 
q ok 
bush not quite sorry 
yeah 
q customs commissioner von raab has said that the war on drugs 
by the federal government is a dismal failure that the state 
department is a department that wasnt there that treasury 
secretary brady is disengaged and disinvolved in the war on drugs 
i suspect i have an idea of what your answer to that might be but 
it is true that drug use is way up that congress has not funded 
the drug programs that have been passed in the last couple of 
years what can you say in light of those facts how could you 
dispute commissioner von raab if indeed youd like to do that 
bush well i dont see much reason getting into a into a 
ill phrase this very politely laughter a match of any 
kind with laughter willie von raab as he leaves the 
government 
and i think hes worked very hard in his field at customs 
i worked with him when i was on the vice presidents task force 
that i headed up 
look the answer is not to respond to criticism who goes after 
people that are working hard like secretary brady who has my full 
confidence but it is to do better 
and thats what im confident the whole drug plan that bill 
bennett is coming up with will address itself to how do we do 
better 
you know its easy to sit and without a tremendous amount of 
experience in foreign affairs and say well we ought to cut off 
colombia we ought to do nothing give no business with colombia 
whatsoever because an awful lot of this insidious stuff comes 
out of colombia 
the colombian government is trying they are cooperating with us 
president barco is 
we what i think we ought to do instead of doing taking that 
kind of action is find ways to help him more

and i talked about that incidentally with margaret thatcher 
and helmut kohl on the recent tirp 
but look i cant i cant go into responding to the personal 
criticisms but i want to see us do better 
weve got good proposals that some of which we have made and 
some that are on the drawing board right now 
and no american can be relaxed about where things stand 
but going around assigning blame to people that are trying hard 
i dont think thats the answer 
this is the last one 
q mr president noriega is still in charge in panama the gao 
says the sanctions havent worked where are you going on panama 
and are you going to accept the situation the way it is 
bush well a little competition over here oas meeting passed 
a resolution that offers some hope 
our the american position is and will remain that noriega has 
to get out 
we are i wish i could give you a much clearer answer that 
there is some plan that is going to solve this problem in the way 
it must be solved 
and the way it must be solved is noriega out and a free fair 
election recognized or if the panamanians decide to go with 
another election held and recognized 
but theres a great frustration level for me on this one 
theres no question about that 
thank you all 
ellen are you feeling deprived laughter 
you thought i had pointed to you and i had 
go ahead and then ill do the walking act with you laughter 
q exxon says it wants to take its cleaning equipment and go 
home and inaudible you said during the campaign youre an 
environmentalist is there anything you can do to convince them to 
finish the job 
bush well exxon i havent i dont know whether john has 
talked to them or sam skinner 
an awful lot has been done thank heavens on this cleanup 
and we will stay engaged and encourage whoever it is to stay 
engaged until this cleanup is complete 
the reports on fishing and some of these matters are quite 
encouraging i might add 
so well wait and see 
you know the final assessment wont be in for a long time 
but i dont want to see exxon prematurely leave the scene or 
prematurely fail to live up to the firm commitments they have made 
i heard a statement again it was only a part of it which i 
took to be somewhat encouraging from an exxon spokesman who 
referred to taking a look once the weather was agreeable again to 
the kind of work that needs to be done 
so but if i had the feeling exxon was going to pull back on an 
agreement or fail to fulfill an agreement theyd made with us with 
the government or with the state of alaska i would be very much 
exercised about that and try my best to do something about it 
the press thank you

president bush on friday refused to say 
whether hed veto a democraticsponsored effort to outlaw flag 
burning because their statute does not go along with his insistence 
on a constitutional amendment 
i will see what comes down here but i will continue to push 
for the approach that i think is the best given the supreme court 
decision he said 
asked if that meant he might sign the bill bush said i 
didnt say that 
the house judiciary committee on thursday approved a 
democraticsponsored criminal statute with a year in jail and an 
unspecified fine for people who burn flags 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and others argue that a 
regular statute could overcome the supreme court ruling that flag 
burning was a protected form of political protest a constitutional 
amendment they argue could erode first amendment rights 
bush told reporters friday the amendment he supports is 
carefully drawn so he isnt worried about infringing on the first 
amendment 
i dont have disrespect for those who want to find a different 
answer he said it was heartening that theres a wide 
array of support for doing something about this question he said 
the presidents words seemed to downplay the political battle in 
congress between supporters of the amendment and of the statute 
but the presidents political operatives are working to use the 
issue against democrats who oppose his amendment by painting them 
as somehow unpatriotic 
house republican leader bob michel rill said thursday that 
white house chief of staff john sununu urged gop leaders this week 
to speak out because the flag amendment was a wedge issue one 
that divides and troubles democrats 
foley said friday he found it troubling that they want to take 
the respect that americans have for the flag and twist it into a 
political issue

exhausted from battling a current pushing her 
away from shore a canadian marathon swimmer gave up early friday 
in her charity fundraiser swim from santa catalina island to the 
mainland 
vicki keiths support crew persuaded her to quit at 319 am 
after she had gained less than half a mile in the last eight hours 
of her swim said crew member craig williams 
keith was less than six miles from cabrillo beach the goal she 
had set for herself 19 hours earlier when she stopped she started 
the swim at santa catalinas emerald bay about 24 miles from 
cabrillo beach 
keith who was asleep friday and unavailable for comment also 
had been hallucinating and thought that a huge tanker was alongside 
her williams said 
that was something else that told us that she was too tired 
because usually she doesnt hallucinate until the second night 
williams said 
last summer keith mastered all five of the great lakes in a 
similar venture that raised more than 550000 for a toronto sports 
training and fitness center and a childrens aquatic center 
she has made the 42mile english channel crossing and swam 
australias sydney harbor in previous marathons also associated 
with childrens charities 
the sea off the california coast is dominated by currents 
carrying cold water southward from alaska but the current keith 
fought through the night was running westward williams said the 
water temperature was in the 60s 
keith wanted to continue but the crew was worried that she 
would be so exhausted by the effort that she would be unable to 
recover sufficiently for a scheduled swim at juan de fuca british 
columbia on aug 10 
keith also worried if she didnt complete the swim that she 
wouldnt raise as much money for the kids williams said 
keiths swim was intended to raise funds for the los angeles 
chapter of variety childrens charities which sponsors 
fundraising events for childrens philanthropic programs in the 
los angeles area

foreign office minister tim sainsbury said friday 
that argentinas new president appears to be seeking more 
normal relations and britain will respond positively 
i hope we can look forward to a period of tangible achievement 
in our relations with argentina thats certainly our aim 
sainsbury told the house of commons friday before parliament 
adjourned for the summer recess 
sainsbury under questioning from a legislator refused to say 
if argentine president carlos menem has sought to reopen 
negotiations with britain over the disputed falkand islands off 
the coast of argentina and the restoration of diplomatic relations 
it is a very delicate matter you would not expect me to go 
into details at this stage said sainsbury but you may rest 
assured that we will respond positively to any proposals consistent 
with our commitment to the falkland islanders 
he said menem who took office july 8 apparently seeks improved 
relations while while putting aside the delicate issue of 
sovereignty over the falklands 
argentina invaded and occupied the british colony in 1982 but 
british forces recaptured the islands in a 74day war 
after the war britain promised the 1600 falklands residents 
most of whom are of british descent that it would not negotiate 
the issue of sovereignty 
previous attempts to improve relations have foundered on the 
question of sovereignty 
britain wants to normalize trade relations with argentina 
negotiate a fishing agreement reestablish air links and reduce 
tension that could lead to a reduction of the costs of maintaining 
a british military garrison on the islands 
during the debate conservative party legislator ray whitney said 
menem had created a distinct and new atmosphere which we must 
seize and take advantage of 
we cannot miss the opportunity which is now opening up 
added whitney who was chairman of the governing conservatives 
foreign affairs committee during the war for the falkland islands 
known in argentina as the malvinas islands 
he said new diplomatic moves would disturb the islanders who 
want to maintain the present status but their longterm interests 
can only be guaranteed by a different set of relationships 
between britain and argentina

died of a rare virus contracted from a monkey was cited and fined 
friday for unsafe working conditions and failure to tell employees 
about the job risks 
international research and development corp of mattawan was 
fined 30600 for six violations five for willful violations and 
one for a serious violation of the michigan occupational safety 
and health administration rules the department of public health 
said 
the investigation followed the june 20 death of thomas mcgeorge 
23 who was infected with the herpes b virus after being scratched 
or bitten by a rhesus monkey a species commonly used in lab 
experiments 
the violations include failure to record and medically monitor 
77 employee monkey bites and scratches during the two months before 
mcgeorges death 
other violations include failure to properly train employees in 
the hazards and health risks of their jobs and failure to perform 
followups on injured employees according to the report signed by 
michael s mosher district supervisor of the state osha 
questionnaires given to employees by the agency found that of 71 
employees who had direct contact with the monkeys 29 said they had 
never heard of the b virus before mcgeorges death 
guidelines drawn up two years ago by the federal center for 
disease control say that all employees handling such potentially 
infected monkeys should be told of the risks 
beside mcgeorge another former laboratory employee also is 
infected with the virus the 21yearold man whose name has not 
been released was discharged from bronson methodist hospital in 
kalamazoo last week following three weeks of treatment hospital 
officials said 
irdc emphatically denies the cruel and untrue allegations 
outlined in the miosha report company spokesman james webb said 
in a statement no employee of irdc has ever been willfully 
injured nor has the company ever violated any laws 
webb said the company plans to appeal the reports findings 
the report said irdcs records show tests conducted on the 
approximately 190 rhesus monkeys from china before the experiment 
began found that about 40 percent of them carried the virus 
the virus is commonly found in rhesus monkeys and is harmless to 
the animals but it has an estimated 70 percent mortality rate 
among humans once symptoms appear 
the company has said the two infected employees never reported 
any bites or scratches but the report found that no illness or 
injury log was kept as recommended by the cdc 
the company also under investigation by the us department of 
agriculture employs about 350 people uses thousands of animals 
including monkeys dogs rabbits and rats to test drugs and 
chemicals for pharmaceutical companies 
blood tests on about 140 current and former irdc employees have 
not turned up any other cases of the virus which attacks the brain 
and central nervous system twelve inconclusive tests are being 
redone officials said

the united states will tell the soviet union 
at a meeting this weekend in stockholm it would be a mistake to 
rearm iran and moscow should use its improving ties with tehran to 
help american hostages held in lebanon an american official said 
friday 
the meeting in the swedish capital between a us delegation 
headed by assistant secretary of state john kelly and a soviet 
delegation led by nicolai kozyrev is part of a series of regional 
sessions the two superpowers have been holding as part of their 
improving relations 
the main topic will be afghanistan where the official said 
the soviets have increased weapons shipments to the kabul 
government to a rate of 2 billion to 3 billion a year that is 
about double the lethal aid moscow had given president najibullahs 
government before the red army withdrew its last troops in 
midfebruary 
despite an overall improvement in relations the soviets have 
complained publicly about continued us arms shipments to rebels 
seeking to overthrow najibullah they charge both the united states 
and pakistan which funnels the weapons to the mujahedeen with 
violating the geneva accords that led to the soviet troop 
withdrawal 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the us 
weapons deliveries would continue in an effort to counter 
steppedup soviet military supplies 
in washington friday soviet marshal sergei akhromeyev a 
military adviser to president mikhail gorbachev said both the 
united states and the kremlin ought to take steps to end 
hostilities in afghanistan 
the soviets meanwhile are expected to reiterate their 
complaints when foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze meets 
saturday with secretary of state james a baker iii in paris where 
they will attend the opening of a monthlong conference on cambodia 
after the death of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the soviets 
agreed to provide arms to iran but the official said it was not 
clear whether potent weapons would be delivered or spare parts for 
old soviet arms 
we think it would be bad for them to start rearming iran and 
we wouldnt like to see new military systems delivered he said 
the us view is that soviet weapons in iranian hands would be 
destabilize the persian gulf region kelly also is expected to tell 
kozyrev that arming iran would hurt the soviet image in the arab 
world

rep tommy robinson of arkansas became the 
second house democrat this year to switch to the republican party 
lambasting his old party friday as unwilling to listen to the 
majority of the american people 
the thirdterm congressman making his announcement in a 
nationally televised appearance from the white house was welcomed 
by president bush as a man of the poeple a man who believes in 
straight talk hard work and getting the job done 
robinson a former sheriff of pulaski county was the third 
democrat this week to be commended by bush after announcing he was 
changing his party affiliation 
the others were retiring district of columbia police chief 
maurice turner said to be considering a run for mayor of the 
nations capital and louisiana secretary of state fox mckeithen 
son of democratic gov john mckeithen and a prospective opponent to 
democratic sen bennett johnston 
robinson has reportedly been considering a run for governor of 
arkansas in 1990 robinson has said he has made a decision but 
wont announce it until congress finishes its business this year 
robinsons switch leaves the house with 256 democrats and 176 
republicans with three vacancies 
the conservative lawmakers party switch brought immediate 
derision from his former democratic colleagues 
we democrats are happy that robinson has finally come out of 
the closet politically so we can fight him out in the open said 
rep bill alexander dark who called robinson a republican 
sympathizer since hes been here 
im glad to have him out in the open instead of snaking me 
behind my back alexander said 
rep beryl anthony dark called robinson a cagey politician 
with the ability to confuse a lot of people 
democrats called on robinson to resign his seat and seek 
election as a republican the most important thing is for the 
voters to render a verdict said democratic national committee 
spokesman mike mccurry 
but robinson said he would not resign as texas sen phil gramm 
did in 1983 when as a democratic member of the house he changed 
party affiliation gramm later won his seat back in a special 
election 
we have no party registration in arkansas republicans vote 
for me democrats independents the like i am not going to 
resign robinson said 
rep bill grant of florida made the switch from the democratic 
to the republican party in february 
as for his former comrades robinson said there is no room for 
conservative southern democrats in todays national democratic 
party 
even after losing five of the last six presidential elections 
in the nation and arkansas the leadership of the democratic party 
still is unwilling to listen to the majority of the american 
people he said 
robinson first elected in 1984 and reelected in 1986 and 
1988 serves on the house armed services veterans affairs and 
aging committees 
earlier this year robinson made headlines because he hired the 
22yearold daughter of his close friend business partner and 
financial backer dallas cowboys owner jerry jones and paid her 
60000 as a member of his congressional staff 
robinson reported owing at least 100000 to jones 
other capitol hill aides just out of college generally make far 
less than miss jones salary

latin americas oldest atomic reactor 
may be shut down after 30 years of operation because of a lack of 
funds said scientists using it for research 
the rv1 at venezuelas institute for scientific investigation 
enjoyed a heyday during the oilboom decade of the seventies said 
alberto maneiro one of two engineers still involved in programs 
using the reactor 
the main benefit weve gotten from it has been the training of 
over 300 technicians and scientists in nuclear technology said 
maneiro 
the reactor with a potential for producing just 3 megawatts of 
power from its chain reactions is running sporadically at about 
half power said maneiro 
we do the best we can for maintenance the problem is the 
government funding has dried up said maneiro 
the institute uses isotopes from the reactor in medical 
research including the formulation of new parasite medications 
said maneiro 
since the fuel used is primarily uranium and not plutonium use 
of nuclear waste as material for nuclear weapons is impossible 
according to maneiro 
venezuela is a signatory of the rio de janeiro pact which holds 
it to maintaining a nuclearfree military 
the head of the institutes physics department maximo garcia 
sucre said the reactor needs just 160000 in immediate funding to 
keep it running safely 
if the money is not forthcoming in the next several months the 
institute will shut down the reactor said garcia sucre closing an 
ambitious chapter of the small nations efforts to lift itself into 
the modern age

a congressman whos fighting the internal 
revenue service in court over 180000 in contested taxes fines 
and penalties fought the irs in the us house of representatives 
on friday he lost 
rep james traficant dohio tried to cut funding for 100 new 
irs agents 
the american people are upset he argued on the house floor 
the need for revenue cannot be deceived nor denied but i say 
here today that the need for justice is more compelling than the 
need for revenue traficant said 
his amendment to cut 3 million from a 56 billion 
appropriation failed on a vote of 39812 extending traficants 
losing streak against the irs 
before he was elected to congress traficant successfully fought 
a felony bribe case in which the government failed to prove that he 
kept money from alleged organized crime figures 
but based on evidence introduced in the 1983 criminal trial and 
a signed statement traficant gave the fbi the irs found that he 
owed back taxes 
us tax court judge john b williams jr ruled in the 
governments favor 
he concluded that traficant owed back taxes of 59278 and 
penalties of 29636 more penalties and interest accumulated 
during traficants appeal and his bill now totals an estimated 
180000 roughly double his congressional salary 
earlier this week the congressmans lawyers argued his appeal of 
that ruling to a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court 
appeals in cincinnati the judges did not indicate when they might 
rule 
the case dates back to 1980 when traficant was a candidate for 
sheriff of mahoning county ohio 
he was accused of accepting bribes during the campaign from 
organized crime figures in the statement to the fbi traficant 
admitted he took money with the understanding that if elected he 
would not interfere with certain criminal activities 
but traficant said he gave the money back and signed the 
statement under duress a us district court jury cleared him of 
the criminal charges 
traficant won that 1980 campaign and four years later was 
elected to congress hes been reelected twice

the communist party met friday and debated 
the governments responsibility for the nations collapsing economy 
and the partys dismal performance against solidarity in the june 
elections 
party chief wojciech jaruzelski opened the twoday meeting but 
party sources said he was likely to resign before the end of the 
session attended by the 230member central committee and the 173 
party deputies of the parliament 
jaruzelski was elected president by the national assembly july 
19 and had said he would resign the party post he has held since 
1981 if he won the presidency 
party spokesman jan bisztyga said at a news conference that 
personnel matters will be taken up saturday 
before the meeting newspapers were filled with debate over the 
idea of dissolving the party and forming new factions of the left 
or whether to fight to keep the party together 
politburo member janusz reykowski told reporters friday the 
course of todays debate gives no justification to the opinion that 
the party is breaking into factions there is an idea of respect 
for pluralism within the party 
the first days discussion was marked by sharp criticism of the 
partys performance in june elections when the solidarity trade 
union won 260 of the 261 seats it contested and of the 
governments handling of the economy 
in a surprise development politburo member wladyslaw baka quit 
his post as party secretary in charge of the economy 
bisztyga said baka resigned because he disagrees with the 
governments inflation policy 
baka has been considered a likely candidate to succeed former 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski who handed in his 
governments resignation when the new parliament was seated last 
month 
rakowski in turn is angling to succeed jaruzelski in the top 
party post 
baka could be shedding his party duties in preparation for 
heading the government or his resignation could be a sign rakowski 
has locked up the party post and baka is being shoved aside 
baka accused rakowskis government of lacking necessary 
stubbornness and consistency in its handling of the economy 
deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula also considered a leading 
candidate for prime minister later rose to defend the governments 
performance the government was criticized for doing too much and 
too little he said the assessments could be different when 
emotions calm down 
inflation is in triple digits and basic foods such as bread and 
meat are in short supply 
baka and rakowski have disagreed over government plans to 
sharply raise food prices aug 1 baka agrees that increases are 
necessary but that steps should first be taken to ensure proper 
supplies and to assist people on fixed incomes 
politburo member janusz reykowski presented a report on the june 
election saying the party was unprepared for competitive balloting 
and had not anticipated how much the roman catholic church would 
rally parishioners to support solidarity 
the pap news agency said the report expressed hope the elections 
will have a curative effect on the party and spur it to change 
chief party ideologist marian orzechowski who also is 
considered a possible successor to jaruzelski said the party must 
change quickly and thoroughly 
most of society has had enough of the party as it has been 
secondly a significant part of the party grass roots has had 
enough of the style and ways of functioning of the party 
leadership pap quoted him as saying 
jaruzelski challenged fellow communists to decide what we 
stand for 
he also said the next full congress of the 2 millionmember 
party should be set soon the last was in 1986 
party sources said a congress could be called as early as this 
fall but bisztyga said no date would be set during the meeting 
the prevailing opinion is that the congress should be held as 
soon as possible as long as there is good preparation he said 
besides rakowski and orzechowski interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak is considered a possible successor to jaruzelski 
in addition to baka and sekula roman malinowski leader of the 
communistallied peasant party is a likely candidate for prime 
minister malinowski would be the first noncommunist head of 
government in the east bloc since world war ii 
jaruzelski as president must nominate the prime minister who 
then must be approved by parliament parliament is scheduled to 
meet monday 
rakowski despite the worsening of the economy during his nine 
months as prime minister was believed to be gathering support for 
the party chiefs post from hardliners and party members fearful 
of solidaritys growing influence 
rakowski is disliked by solidarity for his antagonism toward the 
union during the martiallaw crackdown of 1981 and for his decision 
last year to close the lenin shipyard where solidarity was founded 
nine years ago

gunmen attacked a group of american 
tourists viewing wildlife in southern kenya and killed a woman 
wounded a man and robbed others of money a source said friday 
the attack thursday the second on tourists in kenya this month 
took place as 19 tourists were riding in three vans along the 
40mile road between the amboseli and tsavo national parks the 
source said 
a woman was killed instantly when shot through the head by two 
men with ak47 assault rifles and a man was shot in the chest 
according to the report 
in washington state department spokeswoman frances jones said 
marie esther ferraro age unknown of new haven conn was shot 
and killed and another american was slightly wounded she did not 
give the wounded persons name 
the gunmen apparently ambushed the tourists along a bad stretch 
of road that forced them to slow down said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the trip was organized by the connecticut audubon society and 
had 19 participants 18 from connecticut and one from georgia 
said lauren brown a society spokeswoman in fairfield conn she 
would not identify the victims but said both were from connecticut 
the twoweek tour began july 17 she said 
police commissioner philip kilonzo and richard leakey director 
of wildlife went to the scene to investigate 
it was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists that began 
in september when a dutch tourist was shot in the chest in meru 
national park 
also in september the remains of a british woman were found in 
sprawling masai mara game reserve in southwestern kenya an inquest 
begins aug 7 into her death which her father says was murder 
police have said she could have fallen prey to wild animals 
in the first week of july two french tourists were shot to 
death in meru national park east of mount kenya by poachers 
leakey had called it an isolated incident and said he did not 
think the poachers were looking for tourists to shoot 
in april three west german tourists were wounded by gunmen who 
ambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between tsavo and 
amboseli 
two americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up last 
week while on a horseback riding safari in masai mara the us 
embassy refused to release any details about the two 
maintaining the security of kenyas parks and tourist locations 
is vital to the east africa nation which says it has had nearly 3 
million tourists since 1984 tourism last year brought in nearly 
350 million and has become kenyas top foreign exchange earner 
after the french couple was killed the government said it 
stepped up security to make sure the national parks and game 
reserves were peaceful and comfortable havens for tourists and 
to ensure the survival of wildlife 
kenya has suffered increased poaching activity in which armed 
bandits seeking valuable ivory tusks have been stalking and killing 
elephants primarily in tsavo national park 
since leakey became director of wildlife in march kenya has 
stepped up its antipoaching efforts since january game rangers 
have killed more than 20 poachers

the energy department on friday asked the 
nuclear regulatory commission to require an environmental impact 
statement and conduct a fullfledged hearing before deciding on the 
proposed dismantling of the shoreham nuclear power plant in new 
york 
energy secretary james watkins who has expressed strong 
opposition to the dismantling of the plant said in a letter to the 
commission that closing it for good would be a colossal mistake 
and increase the threat of power shortages in the northeast 
watkins also asked the commission to halt removal of the uranium 
fuel from the reactor now under way and to block plans to reduce 
the plants work force 
the long island lighting co has agreed with the state of new 
york to turn the 55 billion plant over to the long island power 
authority for 1 so that it can be dismantled in exchange for 
yielding the plant the company has received assurances of rate 
increases expected to be about 5 percent annually for the next 10 
years 
utility shareholders approved the plan june 28 and a new york 
state judge upheld the plan earlier this week 
state and local officials contend that a workable evacuation 
plan cannot be drawn up for the area around the new plant which 
though completed in 1985 and licensed in 1988 has yet to produce 
electricity commercially 
the 813megawatt plant is about 50 miles east of new york city 
on the northern shore of long island 
watkins said in his letter to kenneth carr chairman of the 
commission that dismantling shoreham would be contrary to every 
principle associated with the establishment and maintenance of a 
sensible national energy policy 
under federal law the commission must approve the transfer of 
the companys license to operate a nuclear power plant to the long 
island power authority the commission then must approve and 
oversee decommissioning 
watkins said the permanent shutdown of the plant would require 
greater use of fossil fuels resulting in environmental damage 
because of increased emissions that contribute to global warming 
and other environmental problems 
therefore the energy secretary argued the commission should 
conduct a full hearing and require a formal environmental impact 
statement before making a decision 
frank ingram a spokesman for the commission said carr and 
other commissioners have yet to review the letter he said the 
agency would have no immediate comment

the communist party on friday shut down two 
stateowned conglomerates including one linked to senior leader 
deng xiaopings son and ordered an end to many of the special 
privileges enjoyed by high officials 
imported luxury cars special supplies of food pleasure trips 
abroad and rounds of banqueting all must come to an end the party 
politburo ordered in its most serious attack yet on endemic 
corruption that has cost the party much popular support 
if carried out the politburo order would affect officials at 
the uppermost levels of the party and government who have been 
exempt from anticorruption and austerity drives 
the politburos notice was read on television at the end of a 
twoday closed meeting in zhongnanhai the party compound where top 
leaders maintain homes of relative luxury zhongnanhai once was 
part of the imperial palace and its red walls have become a symbol 
to ordinary chinese of the privileges of those in power 
the politburo order clearly was triggered by the student 
democracy movement that was crushed in june which drew hundreds of 
thousands of supporters with the slogan oppose corruption 
the students also lampooned children of senior officials who 
enjoy top posts in government and business including dengs son 
whom they nicknamed prince pufang

prime minister hun sen of cambodia and resistance 
leader prince norodom sihanouk said friday they expect positive 
results from an international conference aimed at finding a 
solution to the cambodian conflict 
the conference of nearly 20 nations opens sunday in paris 
speaking at a news conference hun sen reiterated his hope that 
while negotiations over cambodias internal problems were totally 
bogged down the conference could provide some solutions to other 
problems 
he was referring to the withdrawal of vietnamese troops and the 
assurance that foreign aid to the warring factions will be halted 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze also indicated 
optimism when he arrived friday for the conference 
if there were no hope for peace i wouldnt be here he said 
secretary of state james a baker iii was expected to arrive 
saturday 
in an interview on radio monte carlo sihanouk predicted there 
will be results but he refused to be more specific 
the four cambodian factions comprised of hun sens government 
and a threeparty resistance coalition headed by sihanouk 
confirmed their participation in the conference by reaching a 
compromise thursday on how they will be represented 
the factions will sit under a cambodian banner but with separate 
plaques identifying each of the four groups 
hun sen had demanded two separate delegations his own and 
another representing the resistance sihanouk wanted one 
unified delegation 
hun sen also said it was his hope that the four factions could 
reopen internal talks during the monthlong international conference 
talks between the four factions broke off tuesday after only 
four hours in a dispute over the role of the khmer rouge the 
resistance group with the strongest guerrilla force 
the khmer rouge was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians while it was in power from mid1975 to 
december 1978 vietnam toppled the khmer rouge when it invaded 
cambodia in 1978 it has promised to withdraw its troops by the end 
of september 
sihanouk is demanding a fourparty interim government in 
cambodia that includes hun sen and the khmer rouge hun sen opposes 
the khmer rouge having a role 
khmer rouge leader khieu samphan said in an interview on french 
television that vietnamese expansion was the real danger to 
cambodia and it would be conterproductive for the conference to 
discuss atrocities during the khmer rouge rule 
everyone is free to judge he said but to discuss the khmer 
rouge actions is to fall into the vietnamese trap

libyas civil aviation director said 
friday the instrument landing system at tripoli airport was not 
working when a korean air dc10 crashed short of the fogshrouded 
runway killing at least 77 people 
the system gives the pilot an automatic indication of the center 
of the runway but it had not worked for several months said the 
official mohamed abughres 
the dc10 crashed thursday at least a halfmile short of the 
runway most of those killed were south koreans returning from 
vacation to jobs on engineering or construction projects 
there were conflicting reports on the number killed libyan 
officials said 78 people on the plane were killed the airline in 
seoul said 71 of the 199 people aboard were presumed dead while 
the south korean embassy in tripoli said 72 people on the jet died 
six others were killed on the ground when the airliner 
cartwheeled into several houses and falling wreckage struck a car 
officials said 
abughres said the airport radar radio beacons and other 
navigation aids all were working perfectly when pilot kim hojung 
decided to try landing 
libyas minister of transport mobarak shamak said he had named 
a libyankorean committee to find the causes of the accident 
we gave the pilot all the information about the fog he 
said the last report we gave him was that visibility was down to 
50 meters 150 feet but he decided to land anyway he trusted his 
own instruments 
shamak said a soviet aeroflot plane and a libyan plane that 
approached the airport shortly before the korean air crash decided 
to fly instead to malta and benghazi libya he said 
when shamak visited the pilot in the hospital and presented him 
with roses kim burst into tears he told the minister he was not 
at fault earlier another libyan investigator quoted kim as saying 
he may have been wrong to try to land in the fog 
shamak said he believed the accident was caused by either a 
technical fault in the dc10 or a miscalculation by the captain 
korean air president cho chungkun defended the pilot and 
indicated the control tower was at fault 
in view of the pilots long outstanding professional 
experience and the planes good maintenance records and condition 
it is unlikely that the accident was the result of a human error or 
mechanical malfunction he told reporters and relatives of the 
victims in seoul 
we therefore believe that the pilot suddenly confronted an 
unexpected situation beyond his control as he attempted to land in 
a thick fog he said 
he did not elaborate but airline officials indicated privately 
that the plane had not received proper guidance from air 
controllers 
korean air and south korean government officials ruled out 
terrorism but expressed concern about reports that the dc10 built 
by the mcdonnell douglas corp might have had a structural problem 
thomas downey a mcdonnell douglas spokesman at the douglas 
aircraft headquarters in long beach calif said the aircraft was 
first delivered to air siam on nov 18 1974 and was sold to the 
korean airline feb 5 1977 
as of december 1988 it had flown 39628 hours and completed 
10926 cycles the count of times the fuselage has been 
pressurized he said 
the crash was the second of a dc10 in eight days a united air 
lines dc10 went down july 19 in sioux city iowa killing 111 
people preliminary reports indicate the tail engine blew apart 
damaging the hydraulic system needed to control the jet 
downey said there was no indication that the circumstances of 
the tripoli and sioux city accidents are related nor that they 
relate to previous dc10 accidents 
shamak visited the 84 people who remained hospitalized and 
presented each with two flowers all but three were expected to be 
discharged shortly said mohamad haras director of salahadding 
hospital 
south korean officials flew to tripoli on friday to supervise 
care for the injured and the return of the bodies 
libyas leader col moammar gadhafi expressed his heartfelt 
condolences to south korean president roh taewoo the official 
libyan news agency jana said 
flight 803 originated in seoul and had stopped in bangkok 
thailand and jiddah saudi arabia korean air said 10 foreigners 
were on the plane seven with arab names and three japanese one 
japanese died but a further breakdown was unavailable 
in seoul on friday about 100 relatives of crash victims marched 
in protest for two hours on a road leading to seouls kimpo 
international airport some carried signs calling airline officials 
murderers others demanded they be allowed to fly to libya to 
view the site of the crash

on the stand he could not remember many specifics of the agreement 
placid contributed 824 million of the loan to the partnership 
while the brothers contributed silver gold stocks and north 
dakota coal properties

have been happer to finish by friday than us

president bush expressed concern friday that 
news leaks may jeopardize the espionage investigation of us 
diplomat felix s bloch who investigators now believe began spying 
14 years ago while serving in east berlin 
like the fbi and justice department bush declined to provide 
any facts about the bloch investigation which was leaked to the 
public a week ago 
i dont want to go into it while it is under investigation 
bush told reporters at a white house news conference i am very 
concerned about premature discussion and disclosure that means 
leaks on this matter because i think you can jeopardize the case 
itself and perhaps the mans ability to get a fair hearing 
no charges have been filed against the 54yearold diplomat but 
the state department revoked his diplomatic passport and put him on 
paid leave june 22 under heavy fbi surveillance he has been 
visiting relatives in new york since last saturday 
last friday state confirmed news leaks that the fbi is 
investigating bloch for possible illegal activities involving 
agents of a foreign intelligence service 
since then government sources demanding anonymity have said 
he was videotaped passing a briefcase to a soviet agent in paris 
recently and that the same soviet agent was monitored telephoning 
bloch with what appeared to be a warning he was under investigation 
a congressional source told the associated press the fbi 
currently believes bloch was recruited as a spy while he was 
serving at the us embassy in east berlin 14 years ago the new 
york times reported friday that bloch admitted to the fbi he spied 
for the soviets for many years and that they paid me a lot of 
money 
government sources have said bloch who now has a lawyer has 
refused to cooperate with the fbi since a brief interview june 22 
in 1974 bloch became economic counselor in the newly opened 
us embassy in east berlin he served there for two years after 
transferring from west berlin where he was economiccommerical and 
trade promotion officer in the us mission from 1970 to 1974 
the 1970s were the heyday of markus wolf 66 the very 
successful head of east germanys foreign intelligence operations 
for 29 years until he retired in 1987 wolfs agents worked 
handinglove with the soviet kgb spy agency us officials have 
said 
in 1974 willy brandt resigned as chancellor of west germany 
after one of his closest aides was unmasked as a handpicked spy 
for wolf 
in the early 1970s wolfs agents also recruited an american 
student james frederick sattler who returned to washington to 
work for the atlantic council a prestigious private foreign 
policy study group satler was unmasked as a spy in 1976 when he 
was about to get a job on the house foreign affairs committee 
because he had not yet passed any secrets us officials could not 
charge him with espionage but they used a littleknown spy 
registration law to force him to register publicly with the state 
department as having east german spy training 
former cia official george carver said wolf makes british 
author john le carres fictional soviet spymaster karla look 
like a rank amateur carver said wolf used every trap in the 
book including sex 
in austria where bloch served from 1980 to 1987 as economic 
counselor and then as the no 2 official in the us embassy 
interior minister franz loeschnak confirmed news reports that bloch 
had a friendship with a viennese woman over a period of several 
years austrian officials earlier described her as a callgirl 
the woman returned from a vacation in egypt and was questioned 
by austrian authorities this week austrias top police official 
robert danzinger said but this yielded no evidence she suspected 
anything about bloch 
danzinger said friday that a suspected kgb agent who may have 
been a contact man for bloch traveled to vienna several times in 
the past 10 years on false finnish papers 
danzinger said austrian authorities were told by us officials 
on june 23 about a suspected kgb agent who allegedly had contacts 
with bloch 
we assume he worked for the kgb danzinger said we have 
no information of our own that he is kgb that information came 
solely from washington 
for the second day in a row a top soviet official denied any 
links with bloch he had no connection with us no link that 
could raise the slightest suspicion soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze told reporters at orly airport in paris 
several administration sources have suggested that any 
admissions made by bloch to the fbi or state department security 
officers fell well short of the legal requirements of a confession 
the new york times said the fbi had received information that 
prompted interest in a recent trip bloch was making to europe and 
planned a surveillance operation 
the agency notified foreign intelligence services and 
congressional committees and somehow the information got out the 
paper said as previously reported us eavesdropping picked up a 
soviet agent telling bloch a bad virus is going around and we 
believe you are now infected 
the fbi also got permission to search his home but found nothing 
incriminating the paper said

blacks who seek treatment at 
whitesonly hospitals in a mass defiance campaign may be imprisoned 
for two years authorities said friday 
in the tiny black homeland of venda thousands students 
boycotted classes to protest what they say is a coverup by 
officials investigating recent killings 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister contends the effort to 
seek treatment at white hospitals will include acts of violence 
intended to disrupt segregated national elections scheduled for 
sept 6 
a militant black labor federation accused vlok on friday of 
deliberately misrepresenting the plans for peaceful acts of 
defiance before the election 
in the first phase of the defiance campaign to begin wednesday 
antiapartheid groups have asked blacks and people of mixed race to 
seek medical treatment at eight whitesonly hospitals 
authorities in transvaal province where four of the hospitals 
are located issued a directive saying no one could enter public 
hospitals without official authorization a violator can be 
imprisoned for up to two years and fined 740 
of prime importance is the interest of our patients said 
andre cornelissen a provincial administrator i would therefore 
make an urgent appeal to persons not to be a part of this defiance 
campaign which will exacerbate the fate of defenseless sick 
persons 
the congress of south african trade unions the largest 
organization involved issued a statement denying vloks allegation 
that the plans called for firebomb attacks on homes of election 
candidates and other acts of violence the congress said it was 
considering legal action against vlok 
we want to state openly and categorically that the minister is 
lying it said the arrogance of the minister and his 
government is such that they seem to think they can make any 
allegations they like and get away with it 
in a speech thursday vlok said the call for militant mass 
action was tantamount to a call for violence 
protests in venda have prompted the homeland legislature to 
consider a state of emergency clouding preparations for 
festivities in september marking the 10th anniversary of the 
homelands independence from south africa 
at the university of venda classes for 4000 students have been 
halted since wednesday boycotts began earlier at some primary and 
secondary schools 
venda is in the northeast corner of south africa and has about 
500000 residents it is one of four tribal homelands designated as 
independent by south africa but not recognized abroad 
according to reports in two antiapartheid newspapers the 
protests were inspired in part by three unsolved killings in the 
past two weeks believed by residents to be ritual murders 
in south africa ritual murders are killings in which parts of 
the victims bodies are cut off and used in potions 
last year police in venda confirmed several ritual murders and 
denied charges of a coverup aimed at protecting tribal chiefs and 
government officials accused of involvement the killings last year 
prompted a general strike and the justice minister was dismissed

he said the soviet union believed the united states does not 
have the right to build such a missile 
in washington a bush administration official said ss23s are 
clearly covered by the inf treaty and that lance missiles are not 
it would be absurd for the soviets to suggest that while were in 
compliance with the accord they would have reason to violate it 
the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
nato at a summit meeting in may deferred a decision on 
modernizing the lance missiles a proposal calls for tripling the 
range of the current missiles to just under 300 miles

a prostitute has told a newspaper she was paid 
800 for having sex with three men at an australian embassy party 
while working for an escort service now under federal investigation 
the unidentified womans account published in fridays editions 
of the washington times drew a lengthy denial from australian 
ambassador michael cook who questioned her credibility and 
reputation 
cook in a letter to the newspapers editor said weeks of 
careful investigation have entirely failed to substantiate the 
womans story 
we cannot disprove your story simply because no one can ever 
prove a negative cook wrote 
the times reported that the woman worked for an escort service 
that is now under federal investigation for creditcard fraud 
cook said the story was unfortunately bare of hard facts and 
relied on sketchy information from one woman of uncertain 
reputation 
wesley pruden the newspapers managing editor defended the 
story and noted it had also appeared in an australian newspaper and 
was aired on television in that country 
weve been reporting this story for several weeks pruden 
said we are very confident that we got it right and when the 
ambassador completes his own investigation i think he will see that 
we were right 
the embassys investigation was continuing and spokesman brett 
bayly said australian diplomatic officials here have been in 
touch with american authorities bayly declined to specify what 
us agencies had been contacted 
cook noted in his letter that top embassy officals worked with 
times reporters and investigated the matter thoroughly after 
they were contacted by the newspaper several weeks ago 
for the story to be true would have required those involved 
knowingly to have run extraordinary risks of being surprised 
cook said if the party was supposed to have taken place during 
the week plenty of poeple would still have been working in the 
embassy 
the newspaper said the woman whom it did not identify also 
told of paid sexual encounters with with a canadian diplomat and a 
us soldier who had worked as a bodyguard to washington lobbyist 
and host craig j spence 
spence has been previously identified by the times as a client 
of a homosexual prostitution ring linked to the escort service for 
which the prostitute said she worked 
the us attorneys office is investigating creditcard fraud 
involving the escort services according to sources who have spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
the newspaper quoted the woman as saying that she and two other 
prostitutes each had sexual relations with at least three men at 
the embassy the woman said she was paid 800 in crisp new 100 
bills after the party 
the newspaper said the woman provided a detailed description of 
the embassy party she said the men took me one at a time into 
a room which was like an office it had officetype furniture 
she said the men did not identify themselves 
cook said that the womans descriptions of the embassys 
interior geography and its furnishings simply do not fit the 
facts 
he also said that her descriptions of the men are so vague as 
to be useless in identifying who in the embassy might have been 
involved 
cook said that the source even appeared uncertain that the men 
alleged to have been in the incident were australians

conference opening this weekend in paris on cambodias future 
secretary of state james a baker iii symbolizing us interest 
in a settlement of the 10year war in the hapless country will 
represent washington in a 20nation conference that almost broke up 
before it began 
baker will meet on the side saturday with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze possibly laying the foundation for 
a superpower summit meeting later this year 
the secretary left washington friday afternoon for paris 
disarray among four cambodian factions threatens to cause a 
breakdown at any point in the monthlong conference which will 
have its ceremonial opening sunday baker and assistant secretary 
of state richard solomon who will head the us delegation after 
baker goes home monday are hoping that an agreement can be worked 
out that preserves cambodias independence 
a 10year civil war between the forces of provietnam prime 
minister hun sen and three guerrilla factions widened the 
destruction of what remained of the cambodian civilization after 
the murderous rule of pol pot from 1975 to 1978 before that the 
united states in the indochina war contributed to the devastation 
of the country 
currently the united states is providing 3 million to 5 
million a year in training and nonlethal supplies to the factions 
headed by prince norodom sihanouk and son sann while china is 
arming the pol pot forces 
the us goal is a transitional government that does not return 
pol pots group to power it is suspected of murdering more than 1 
million cambodians nor leaves hun sen in charge after vietnamese 
troops pull out in late september 
frederick z brown a former state department official who has 
written a new book second chance about cambodia said at a 
news conference friday that the united states could be a major 
player in paris 
a lot of people are looking to us because our involvement has 
been relatively aloof brown said 
he agreed with the stance taken by the bush administration 
though that the cambodian parties themselves must arrive at a 
solution for their country 
referring to the indochina war brown said this was not the 
occasion for a new crusade by the united states which warred 
with north vietnam and bombed cambodia but he said the united 
states now has a second chance to help in the countrys 
rehabilitation and to improve its standing in the region

an independent palestinian state remains 
the plos major condition for agreeing to elections in the 
israelioccupied territories ahmed abdelrahman said friday 
abdelrahman spokesman for the palestine liberation 
organization said in a telephone interview that reports that the 
plo has softened its position on elections were fabricated by the 
israeli leadership 
the plo position is that we are for elections but in the 
context of a comprehensive settlement he said such a settlement 
would specify that the final result of negotiations would be a 
palestinian state he added 
comments by a soviet official and palestinians who met with 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir had indicated the plo might 
have changed its stand 
abdelrahman said the comments did not represent the plos 
position toward elections 
shamir has proposed elections in which the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza strip would choose 
representatives to negotiate an interim selfrule plan talks would 
be held later on the final status of the territories 
but shamir has said the plo conditions are not acceptable and he 
would not deal with the plo which israel considers a terrorist 
group even it the plo abandoned those conditions 
israeli labor party legislators have said a us document 
reflected a softer plo position an israeli official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday the document was relayed to 
israel by soviet middle east envoy gennady terrasov the official 
said terrasov met an aide to vice premier shimon peres after 
holding talks earlier with plo chairman yasser arafat 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutweiler 
denied that such a memorandum existed 
abdelrahman said terrasov met with arafat and then with an aid 
to peres but insisted terrasov only relayed the established plo 
conditions for accepting elections 
he said israeli leaders were behind the reports of a softened 
plo stance so they can say to the americans that the plo is 
coming to their position mr shamir is trying to win time 
a plo leader commenting on the reports of palestinians meeting 
with shamir said the plo did not authorize any palestinian 
inside the occupied territories to negotiate with the israeli 
government 
salah khalaf made the statement in an interview with the kuwaiti 
newspaper alwatan 
khalaf is the no 2 man in arafats fatah the leading 
palestinian group in the plo 
he denied reports that four palestinians from the occupied 
territories met with shamir on instructions from the plo 
alwatan in a dispatch from tunis where the plo is 
headquartered quoted khalaf as saying the plo leadership did not 
ask the four palestinians who met the israeli prime minister 
recently to do so 
he said the plo is against allowing any party outside the 
legitimate institutions the power to open talks with the 
israelis under any circumstances 
khalaf also denied the he had agreed during a recent meeting 
with robert pelletreau the usambassador to to tunisia that the 
four palestinians meet with shamir 
such a topic was not raised during the meetings with 
pelletreau he said 
pelletreau opened a dialogue with the plo leadership after the 
united states dropped its opposition to dealing with the plo when 
the organization renounced terrorism and recognized the state of 
israel in a statement last november 
in an interview with the bahrainbased gulf news agency one of 
the palestinians who met with shamir said details of the meeting 
reached the plo leadership in tunis via different channels 
jamal altarifi a proplo lawyer was intervewied by telephone 
in london he did not say he had received plo clearance for the 
meeting but told the agency no meeting or initiative from any 
palestinian figure can succeed if it does not have the approval of 
the plo leadership

moscows deputy mayor said friday he 
hopes to learn something from american methods of finance and 
budgeting during a tour of us cities and has already found some 
pleasant surprises like boston harbor 
they told us there was a necessity to clean the harbor but we 
found that it was much cleaner and fresher than we were told 
valery a zsharov said after a george bushstyle inspection 
tourthe harbor became a political issue during last years 
presidential campaign 
zsharov and his interpreter albert s gasparian head of the 
protocol unit for moscows foreign relations department said they 
hope to learn how to deal with some of the problems of 
decentralization in soviet cities under soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs policy of perestroika 
the cities have some of the good things in common and some 
problems in common too said valery a zsharov but he said the 
economic approaches to solving the problems in his city will be 
quite different from that in us cities 
zsharov arrived in providence last week he and his interpreter 
and two other colleagues will leave providence on aug 7 and will 
travel to new york los angeles and atlanta before returning to the 
soviet union 
their trip was sponsored by brown universitys a alfred taubman 
center for public policy and american institutions at the schools 
center for foreign policy development 
the visitors were taken to boston for two days to meet with 
present and former elected officials on the state local and 
federal levels along with the heads of various state agencies 
developers and builders 
as a result of legislation designed to decentralize bureaucracy 
in the soviet union the moscow soviet or city council is trying 
to improve its abilities in budgeting and finance and in boosting 
economic development 
the city has some 2 million employees handling functions 
usually carried out by private enterprises in the united states 
as deputy mayor zsharov directs moscows main department of 
trade restaurants and consumer services and coordinates joint 
ventures for the city he also has a strong voice in how the citys 
4billionruble budget is spent 
zsharov 53 said that while there are similarities between 
boston and moscow there are strong differences such as employment 
in boston there is unemployment and we need labor we have a 
very high labor shortage he said chainsmoking russian 
cigarettes the shortage creates some difficulties 
moscows problems are very open and clear he said the 
most acute are housing and transportation much of our housing 
was destroyed in world war ii its much more acute than in the 
us 
zsharov was most impressed with the construction and building 
industry in the united states 
up to now we cannot boast that level of construction 
zsharov said he said moscow is working on a longterm program 
through the year 2000 in an attempt to build enough apartments to 
house everyone in the city 
at brown the soviets are studying how local state and federal 
governments in the united states make up budgets distribute money 
and interact with one another they also will tackle problems like 
environmental damage and urban revitalization

a man who spent 13 years in prison for the 
killing of a police officer was freed friday after an appeals court 
upheld a federal judges ruling that crucial evidence had been 
suppressed by prosecutors 
i feel great said v james landano as he left the federal 
courthouse right now i just want to get away 
judge leonard i garth of the 3rd us district circuit court 
of appeals on friday denied the states appeal to overturn the 
decision of a federal judge who reversed landanos conviction on 
thursday 
us district judge h lee sarokin vacated landanos conviction 
ruling that prosecutors covered up evidence casting doubt on 
eyewitness identifications of landano as the man who shot dead a 
newark policeman during a 1976 robbery 
sarokin said the prosecution showed a pattern of failures in 
turning over exculpatory evidence 
sarokin was the judge who last year freed rubin hurricane 
carter a boxer serving life for a triple murder on grounds that 
carters conviction was tainted by racism and suppressed evidence 
garth set tuesday as the deadline for prosecutors to appeal 
landanos release 
the state does plan to continue with its appeal said 
christopher florentz a spokesman for the state attorney generals 
office were going to do it as quickly as possible 
landano sentenced to life in prison has maintained he was 
framed by motorcycle gang members protecting the real killer his 
childhood friend 
landano and three others were charged in the killing of 23year 
veteran officer john snow at the robbery of a checkcashing 
establishment in kearny landano was convicted as the gunman 
victor forni was later convicted of planning the crime for the 
breed motorcycle gang and served nine months of a twoyear sentence 
when landano supporters compiled evidence pointing to his 
innocence sarokin last month ordered investigative files seized 
and from them landanos lawyers found the papers on which the 
judge based thursdays decision 
one was a kearny police interview report with a witness at a 
warehouse near the crime scene who identified a picture of forni 
as the getaway car driver the driver had been identified as the 
gunman the report was never given to landano and the picture never 
found 
sarokin also cited a handwritten document from kearny police 
files saying that the only eyewitness of the shooting had said of 
landano hair not right suspect had curly hair notes on 
another witness said the same thing 
newark police officials decried the judges decision saying 
landano should have been kept in custody until the crime was 
resolved 
to have him walk out of jail without being retried or the 
triggerman who killed officer snow being located would be a great 
injustice said newark police chief john golba 
the newark lodge of the fraternal order of police the 
bargaining agent for about 1000 newark policemen said it opposed 
freeing landano and would protest the decision if landano did not 
get a retrial 
bail was set at 50000 but landano a new york city resident 
was released on his own recognizance into the custody of his 
attorney neil mullin it was not clear friday if landano would 
face another trial state deputy attorney general carol henderson 
said the state would appeal thursdays decision on the grounds that 
the federal courts did not have the right to intervene in the case 
ms henderson said landano did not exhaust all his options under 
the state court system

president alan garcia in his final 
stateofthenation address urged congress friday to adopt the 
death penalty for acts of terrorism 
he also told congress that a system of military courts should be 
established to try suspected terrorists 
peru now has the death penalty only in cases involving treason 
during time of war garcia did not elaborate on proposed military 
courts to try cases involving terrorism those cases now are tried 
in civil courts 
garcia also said that presidential elections will be held next 
april as specified by law 
some members of his centerleft aprista party had called for 
early elections because of the possibility of runoff balloting if 
no candidate wins a majority of the vote the law sets the date for 
the presidential balloting to be on the second sunday of the 
election year and garcia said the election would be on april 8 
1990 
he said he would name a bipartisan congressional commission to 
guarantee an absolutely clean election 
garcia is barred by the constitution from running for a second 
term and the winner is to be installed on july 28 it is expected 
there will be three major candidates representing aprista the 
centerright democratic front alliance and a coalition of leftist 
parties 
deputies wanting the presidential election to be held early said 
that if a runoff is required the winner might not be determined in 
time for the installation a runoff election between the top two 
vote getters would be held within 30 days after the first election 
some deputies noted that in the last presidential election in 1985 
it took more than two months for ballots from outlying areas to 
arrive and be counted in lima 
garcia referring to attacks by guerrillas of the maoist shining 
path and procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement said the 
armed forces are the greatest guarantee for our democracy against 
subversion 
his address on television and radio could not be seen or heard 
by many peruvians because of a power failure the blackout in 
sections of lima and other areas was caused by rebel bombings 
wednesday of substations in the power network near huancayo 140 
miles east of lima 
garcia spoke of disappointments during the first four years of 
his 5year term 
after four years i can make a confession he said i 
wanted to do more to move the country along very quickly change 
the structure of economic power 
but this is difficult to do sometimes impossible when you 
use as your instrument a centralized bureaucratic state made to 
serve the big powers 
when he took office in 1985 garcia said peru would no longer 
deal with the international monetary fund which he called an 
instrument of imperialism he also announced peru would limit 
payments on its foreign debt to 10 percent of its foreign exchange 
money diverted from the debt service was used to finance jobs 
programs raise the minimum wage and subsidize imports 
public opinion polls showed that during his first year in office 
garcias popularity soared to 90 percent but surveys indicate it 
has dropped to about 10 pecent now as the economy faltered and fell 
with deficit spending crippling inflation and labor strikes 
in 1988 perus gross national product decreased by nearly 9 
percent and inflation registered 1780 percent 
the foreign debt of 165 billion more than doubles the nations 
gross national product of 30 billion

slowed the flames while the opposite was true for the boise 
national forest 
the humidity dropped considerably said lynette davis boise 
forest spokeswoman when the air dried out the fires got up and 
ran 
a lightning storm earlier this week covered central idaho with 
500 fires some limited to just a burning tree firefighters 
concentrated on the larger blazes while parachuting smokejumpers 
or helicopterborne crews tackled the small ones 
the containment of small fires and shuffling of crews friday 
left it difficult to assess total acreage burned or manpower on the 
fire lines

the ruling frelimo party presented a 
new policy document friday that drops all references to marxism 
leninism and western imperialism 
the document submitted at the partys first national congress 
since 1983 says frelimo the front for the liberation of 
mozambique remains committed to socialism but it deletes 
references to the class struggle and says party members should 
express the aspirations of the entire people 
the alterations coincide with a new drive by the government to 
end a 12yearold civil war that has devastated the economy and 
left millions of mozambicans dead displaced or dependent on food 
aid 
president joaquim chissano has asked presidents robert mugabe of 
zimbabwe and daniel arap moi of kenya to arrange for preliminary 
peace talks with rebels of the mozambique national resistance 
for many years mozambican authorities have accused neighboring 
south africa of supporting the rebels but chissano said this month 
he was prepared to accept assurances that the south african 
government no longer sanctioned such aid 
frelimo took power in 1975 after a prolonged guerrilla war 
against portuguese colonial rule frelimo leaders established a 
oneparty marxistleninist state and described themselves in a 
1983 policy document as the vanguard of the workerpeasant 
alliance 
the new document describes the party as the vanguard of the 
mozambican people and deletes a previous reference to 
mozambiques role in a world antiimperialist front 
that change reflects mozambiques improving relations with 
western countries such as the united states italy and britain 
which supply substantial quantities of aid 
mozambiques government has maintained its close ties with the 
soviet union and other east bloc countries the new policy document 
calls for an independent foreign policy based on the defense of 
national interests 
the government for several years has been moving to end central 
control of the economy it has met loan conditions from the 
international monetary fund and the world bank and has experienced 
modest growth in the past two years after a decade of sharp decline 
frelimo also has proposed allowing businessmen property owners 
shopkeepers and religious believers to join the party after years 
of poor relations 
about 200000 of mozambiques 15 million people belong to 
frelimo

the hearst corp told employees of the los 
angeles herald examiner on friday that it is selling the daily 
newspaper an editor at the paper said 
we got the announcement today said andrea herman the 
papers features editor they have put up the paper for sale and 
will evaluate offers from interested parties 
the reason for the sale was not publicly announced but a 
statement issued to newspaper employees said the sale stemmed from 
intense pressure from the papers competition in the nations 
secondlargest newspaper market 
for a number of years the herald examiner has been in an 
extremely challenging situation said the statement by robert j 
danzig vice president and general manager of herald newspapers 
in recent years the herald examiner has lost readers to the los 
angeles times and the los angeles daily news as well as growing 
suburban papers 
with a circulation of 238392 daily and 183122 on sunday 
editions the herald examiner ranks as the 42nd largest newspaper 
in the country ms herman said 
daily circulation peaked at 729000 in 1967 when the herald 
examiner was the nations largest afternoon daily the newspaper 
guild launched a 10year strike that year from which the newspaper 
never recovered economically 
we have weighed these considerations carefully and have 
reached a conclusion that continuing our ownership of the herald 
examiner is not compatible with the strategic direction of our 
newspaper company danzig said 
hearst a privately held company has acknowledged financial 
losses at the herald examiner but does not disclose specific 
figures for the newspaper 
despite its financial difficulties the herald examiner has 
earned a reputation as a scrappy newspaper with vigorous coverage 
of the city 
the newspaper was the first to delve into the financial dealings 
of mayor tom bradley and its queries into bradleys ties with a 
commercial bank prompted this weeks city council hearings into a 
controversial deposit of city funds with the bank 
hearst hired the investment banking firm of lazard freres amp co 
of new york to handle negotiations for the sale according to the 
announcement given newspaper employees 
the paper has 760 editorial and administrative employees ms 
herman said 
john j mccabe the herald examiners chief operating executive 
could not be immediately reached for comment editor maxwell 
mccrohon was out of town 
the internal company announcement did not cite possible a 
possible sales price or say if there would be any personnel 
changes ms herman said

of setting up a 12member committee to probe the allegations made 
by the centerright new democracy party five of the 294 deputies 
present abstained 
new democracy is the dominant party in greeces 
conservativecommunist coalition government papandreou is a 
socialist 
once the committee is formed it has one month to investigate the 
allegations if it finds that charges can be pressed a special 
high court will convene to try papandreou

eight years until it was swept from power in june 18 elections in 
which no party won a majority

deputies charged that papandreou used facilities provided by 
greeces national intelligence service and the staterun greek 
telecommunications corporation to eavesdrop president christos 
sartzetakis political foes and his own cabinet ministers 
none of us ever compained about legal wiretaps but there was 
an unprecedented network eavesdropping on politicians journalists 
and even members of their party new democracy leader constatine 
mitsotakis said 
parliament has ordered a committee to investigate allegations 
that papandreou and other senior ministers were involved in a 210 
million fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal

early tests of a new aids drug are so 
promising that federal scientists are expressing hope it may become 
a powerful new weapon against the epidemic that now numbers 100000 
cases 
scientists say they hope to start an expanded second phase of 
tests this fall and perhaps have the drug available for wide use 
next year 
phase i trials described in a report published today in the 
journal science showed that the drug called ddi controlled the 
growth of the aids virus and enabled patients to gain weight feel 
better and develop some resistance to infection 
this is not a cure for aids said dr robert yarchoan a 
national cancer institute researcher who helped direct the phase i

researchers have isolated fetal cells 
from pregnant womens bloodstreams suggesting it should be 
possible to diagnose genetic disorders in a fetus simply by taking 
a blood sample from the mother 
if the preliminary finding of fetal cells in mothers 
bloodstreams is confirmed it should be possible to do the same 
kind of genetic tests on those fetal cells as are now done on fetal 
tissue samples obtained through amniocentesis that procedure 
involves the withdrawal of some of the fluid surrounding the fetus 
making the diagnosis from a blood sample would eliminate the 
small risk associated with amniocentesis the researchers said 
the method however cannot be used to screen for downs 
syndrome and other disorders in which the chromosomes must be 
examined under a microscope because the fetal cells isolated from 
the mothers bloodstream do not allow chromosome diagnosis

william lucas president bushs embattled 
nominee to be the chief civil rights enforcer is denying a new but 
unverified allegation that he once complained about a federal 
housing discrimination suit against a predominantly white detroit 
suburb 
justice department spokesman david runkel said late thursday 
that lucas nominated as assistant attorney general for civil 
rights denied urging the government to drop a housing 
discrimination suit against the city of birmingham mich 
the allegation was contained in a letter to the senate judiciary 
committee from michael sussman a former justice department civil 
rights lawyer who now represents black plaintiffs in the landmark 
desegregation case against yonkers ny 
this kind of a lastminute tactic is reprehensible from 
somebody who is certainly aware of the system to raise an issue

portauprince haiti ap a new freedom of expression in book 
publishing has flourished in haiti in the three years since the 
overthrow of jeanclaude duvalier as president for life 
although impoverished and highly illiterate this nation of 6 
million people now has about 500 locally published book titles 
available including more than 200 so far this year 
the publication of books has risen even though haiti has seen 
army repression antigovernment demonstrations massacres and 
three coups since the downfall of the duvalierfamily dynasty in 
1986 
laennec hurbon a sociologist and one of haitis leading 
writers says haiti now publishes more books than any other country 
in the caribbean 
there has been an intellectual renaissance he said 
haitian authors introduce their new works every week at cultural 
centers such as the national library the french institute la 
pleiade library and bato fou restaurant 
during the 29 years of duvalier rule freedom of speech and book 
publishing were stifled magazines and newspapers were not allowed 
to print stories on local politics state censors regularly cut out 
articles considered subversive from french and american weekly 
magazines before they were displayed on newsstands 
when francois papa doc duvalier jeanclaudes father was 
in power from 1957 until his death in 1971 entire rooms of the 
main post office in portauprince were stacked to the ceiling with 
books confiscated from the mails 
haiti exhibited 300 recently published books at the convention 
earlier this year of the association of caribbean research and 
institutional libraries in jamaica 
the other exhibitors were absolutely dumbfounded by their 
quantity and quality said ludmilla joseph legaldeposit 
secretary of the national library 
jamaica with 22 new books was the second most abundant 
exhibitor joseph said 
since independence from france in 1804 haitians have published 
some 17000 titles the vast majority in french the language of 
the educated elite according to the national library 
haitian authors say that the countrys political uncertainty 
poverty and widespread illiteracy make the publishing boom even 
more impressive 
when you take our 75 percent illiteracy rate into account 
haiti is one of the frontrunners of the world said historian 
dr georges michel who in july autographed his newly published 
history of haitian railroads during promotional sales at 
several portauprince cultural centers 
since jeanclaude duvalier was overthrown henri deschamps 
haitis major publisher has issued 150 new books including a 
series of haitian literary and historical classics novels essays 
and textbooks 
the deschamps catalogue includes 40 titles in creole a language 
derived from 18th century contact between frenchspeaking 
slaveholders and african slaves and spoken by all haitians 
the montrealbased haitianrun international center of haitian 
documentation and information has published 26 new titles in the 
past three years and plans to publish world classics in creole 
but book sales are limited in a country with an annual per 
capita income of less than 300 
our market is small and for many of our customers the average 
of 10 per book is high said monique lafontant coowner of the 
bookstore la pleiade 
we authors cannot make a decent living from our writings in 
spite of our hard work said historian georges corvington who 
has never sold more than 2000 copies of any one of the six volumes 
of his popular portauprince through the ages 
hurbon is the author of five books on haiti and research 
director at the national center for scientific research in paris 
his most recent title comprendre haiti understanding haiti 
has sold 4000 copies 
other contemporary haitian authors include novelist roger 
dorsainvil and historians roger gaillard and jean fouchard 
two titles to be published later this year are an illustrated 
twovolume history of haitian art by philippe lerebours director 
of the national school of arts and a new edition of the 
internationally acclaimed thus speaks the uncle by the founder 
of the haitian negritude movement jeanprice mars 
last christmas we made a cultural breakthrough for the first 
time our customers bought more haitian titles than french and 
foreign titles combined lafontant of la pleiade said 
though most haitians are unable to read their countrys 
publications the information is filtering down to the 
intellectually alert but nonreading masses by word of mouth and 
through the radio said deschamps 
high school and college students make up the bulk of those who 
visit autographpromotional sales where authors offer 50 percent 
discounts 
i am publishing for the future for 20 years from now 
deschamps said in the long run the investment in human 
resources will pay off

on the duncolored slopes of the kyrenia 
mountains overlooking this divided capital turkish cypriots have 
carved a huge islamic crescent and a fashioned a huge turkish 
cypriot flag in stones 
theyre a constant taunt to the christian greek cypriots 
reminding them that onethird of the east mediterranean island is 
still occupied by the moslem turks 15 years after they invaded july 
20 1974 
not that most greek cypriots want to forget or let anyone else 
do so travellers leaving from larnaca airport on the south coast 
pass roadside posters reading dont forget the turkish 
invasion 
greek cypriots believe they hold the moral high ground and by 
keeping the division of cyprus prominent in the international arena 
they will be able to end the occupation 
the kyrenia range which looms over the islands central plain 
is in the territory the turkish cypriots declared a breakway 
republic in 1983 
nicosia itself is split by the socalled green line a 
112milelong buffer zone that snakes across the island 
it is patrolled by 2300 united nations peacekeeping troops who 
have been in cyprus since sectarian bloodletting erupted in 1964 
along the line soldiers of the rival communities forces face 
each other from sandbagged pillboxes in urban alleyways and hilltop 
bunkers sometimes only yards apart 
on the july 20 anniverary of the invasion 1000 greek cypriot 
women many of them refugees from the north stormed through the 
buffer zone to occupy a warruined weedencrusted school and 
church 
turkish cypriot riot police stormed the roofless buildings 
beating the women with clubs one hundred women were arrested and 
put on trial a move that infuriated the greek cypriots 
the protest by women demanding the right to return to their 
homes in the turkish cypriot sector and the turkish response 
aroused sectarian passions and threatened to wreck unsponsored 
talks on reunifying the island in a bizonal federation 
the current round of negotiations between president george 
vassiliou the greek cypriot leader and turkish cypriot leader 
rauf denktash have continued for 10 months with little sign of 
progress despite initial hopes of a breakthrough 
denktash wants complete political equality even though the 
turkish cypriots form only 17 percent of the population with the 
norths moslem identity intact 
the greek cypriots want a federal framework with the 200000 of 
their people who fled the north allowed to return a move that 
would swamp the turkish cypriots 
denktash president of the turkish cypriot state has cast 
doubts on a federation 
the greek cypriot leadership did not contribute to peace by 
pushing the women toward our border he said 
the bottom line is that after the sectarian atrocities of the 
past the 120000 turkish cypriots feel secure with their own 
state even if it is only recognized by turkey and totally 
dependent on the turkish government economically and militarily 
denktash noted in a broadcast on radio bayrak the breakaway 
states radio the greeks continue to have claims on the north 
but the turks do not intend to be divided again 
if 1974 brought the turkish cypriots security it traumatized 
the greek cypriots 
more than 2000 of their people were killed an additional 1600 
are missing still unaccounted for 
onethird of their number are refugees in their own land and 
although many have successfully rebuilt their lives and businesses 
the issue remains inflammatory as the womens protest showed 
the turkish army lost 2000 men killed and the turkish cypriots 
900 in 1974 seven hundred others remain missing forty thousand 
moved north 
there are 30000 turkish regulars with tanks and missiles in the 
north to the greek cypriots thats an intolerable violation of 
cyprus internationally recognized sovereignty 
legitimacy is our main counterweight to the turkish troops in 
the north president vassilious adviser michael attalides 
noted recently 
there are also some 50000 mainland turkish settlers in the 
north the greek cypriots accuse turkey of trying to alter the 
islands demography 
the politically powerful settlers are not welcomed by all 
turkish cypriots either many see them as a threat 
if the settler trend continues in 10 years the greek 
cypriots will probably find theyre negotiating with mainland 
turks said ozker ozgut leader of the opposition turkish 
republican party in the north 
many greek cypriots prefer to forget that the invasion was 
triggered by a shortlived coup by militant supporters of union 
with greece backed by the rightwing military junta that ruled in 
athens at the time 
the turks said they struck to protect the turkish minority for 
whom union with greece means total greek domination 
in the 15 years since 1974 differences have if anything 
deepened 
the greek cypriot economy has flourished despite the loss of 70 
percent of the islands agricultural land and the port of famagusta 
but the turkish cypriots cold shouldered by the international 
community remain impoverished dependent on turkey for survival 
a generation of young people on both sides of the dividing line 
has grown up with no knowledge of the other 
they are unable to grasp the passions of their elders and are 
more prepared to accept the status quo

japhet isaack fled namibia in 1978 to 
join the swapo guerrilla movement and fight south african rule 
but he said his toughest battle was for his own survival at 
swapo prison camps in southern angola where hundreds of his 
countrymen allegedly have been tortured and remain locked in 
dungeons run by the guerrillas who accused them of being south 
african spies 
isaack has worked with other recently released swapo detainees 
to compile the names of 439 people they believe still are held and 
94 more they think have been killed by swapo the southwest africa 
peoples organization they say the number of detainees could be as 
high as 2000 
these people have been falsely imprisoned and tortured 
isaack said in an interview we must not forget about them until 
we know they are safe 
the lists have dates and locations in angola where each 
individual was last seen the united nations says it is 
investigating but maintains it has no concrete evidence of 
additional detainees 
the population would like to know the whereabouts of 2000 
men un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said after a 
recent visit to namibia 
swapo which has waged a 23year bush war against south 
africanled security forces is favored to win elections set for 
november and form a government when the territory receives 
independence early next year on a date still to be decided 
the organization said it released all 201 of its political 
prisoners in april including isaack from a camp in southern 
angola where they were registered by un officials 
but only 153 including women and children have returned to 
namibia neither the united nations nor swapo has said where the 
remaining 48 are 
martti ahtisaari who heads the un contingent monitoring 
namibias independence process declined to say whether the united 
nations has requested permission from the angolan government or 
swapo to visit the prison camps 
the international committee of the red cross says it has 
repeatedly sought but never received access to swapo camps 
we know there are missing people said nicolas de rougemont 
head of the red cross operation in namibia whether there still 
are people in detention we dont know because we cant verify 
swapo has acknowledged abuses against detainees saying it was 
engaged in a war for survival and had to ferret out suspected 
south african spies south african security officials continue to 
boast that they have a huge network of agents working inside swapo 
we considered the prisoners as spies but not as enemies 
said theoben gurirab swapos longtime un representative and 
now head of its foreign affairs office we recognized they were 
brainwashed and we decided to detain them during the course of the 
war 
more than a dozen exprisoners were interviewed by the 
associated press and all said they were falsely accused of spying 
and that the guerrilla movement never presented evidence to support 
the charges 
we have committed no crime against the namibian revolution and 
we pledge to remain faithful to the total liberation of our 
people the exprisoners said in a joint statement 
virtually all the former detainees have long thick scars 
crisscrossing their backs legs wrists and ankles 
isaack said he was arrested and accused of spying in may 1986 
shortly after he had been named swapos deputy representative to 
the united nations 
during his time in detention he said he was hung upside down 
from a tree and beaten unconscious with sticks and electrical 
wires he also was buried in sand with a plastic bag over his face 
for minutes at a time he said 
others have told similar stories and said additional forms of 
torture included pouring gasoline onto open wounds after hours of 
beatings 
several female prisoners said they were sexually abused and 
beaten while pregnant after giving birth they remained imprisoned 
and had no access to medical care for themselves or their children 
they said 
the prisoners also said that during the regular torture sessions 
they were threatened with death unless they confessed to being 
south african spies 
they told of living in filthy overcrowded pits most said they 
knew many people who suddenly disappeared from the prisons or died 
in detention because of the unsanitary conditions and the severity 
of the torture 
many of the former detainees are young articulate and educated 
unusual in a territory where more than half the population is 
illiterate three of the detainees were former members of swapos 
central committee 
exdetainee eric biwa and other former prisoners say they 
believe the old guard swapo leadership concocted a spy bogey as 
an excuse for cracking down on young challengers who questioned 
strategy particularly the military effort 
swapo has been unable to solve its internal differences in the 
past said biwa who was arrested while studying in cuba in 1984 
we will work against a swapo election victory because we fear 
what they will do if they come to power 
swapos gurirab claims the organization will prosecute people 
suspected of torture swapo also has said that thousands of swapo 
members or supporters were harassed tortured or detained without 
trial by the south africanled security forces 
but the prisoners held by swapo say details about the past 
abuses must be made public 
our hope is that namibia will never again be ripped asunder by 
war the exdetainees joint statement said but swapo must 
release all namibians unjustifiably called enemy agents and must 
announce how many people it killed and why

thousands of refugees are streaming 
back to namibia as independence approaches but their numbers are 
well short of the 80000 that the swapo movement claimed and 
received money for during its years in exile 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees has given 
swapo the southwest africa peoples organization more than 21 
million in aid for the 80000 refugees that guerrilla officials 
said they cared for in neighboring angola zambia and botswana 
but when swapo registered exiles for repatriation earlier this 
year it produced only 41000 names un officials accepted this 
figure without taking their own count according to sylvester 
awuye deputy director of the un refugee office in windhoek 
fewer than 30000 of the 41000 have returned under the un 
program which began in midjune 
swapo leader sam nujoma has said the conflicting refugee figures 
are due to large numbers of schoolchildren who are not being 
returned because war damage to schools and villages in northern 
namibia would deprive them of classrooms 
in any nation you find that children are in a majority so 
those who are registered to return are those above the age of 
18 said nujoma who has yet to return to namibia himself 
after independence when we build the schools we will take them 
along 
in addition to the un program an estimated several thousand 
refugees have entered northern namibia from angola informally in 
recent months the border is more than 600 miles long and is 
unmarked in many parts formal entry points are staffed irregularly 
and can ususally be crossed with a few polite words to the border

navajos disdain of community living has 
long given fits to an industry whose trademark is poles stretching 
to the horizon 
where people live close together the traditional telephone 
system works fine but when they are scattered most companies cant 
justify the cost said francis mike general manager of navajo 
communications co navajos dont live in large clusters they 
live miles apart 
for suzie randall that meant a 12mile trek from her home in 
nazlini to chinle every two to three weeks for the past 21 years to 
call her daughters in denver and fort defiance followed by a 
12mile return trip 
the old days and the new now meet at the 79yearold mrs 
randalls oneroom house sheepskins dry in a shade house out 
front hugging the back wall looking like a giant mushroom beside 
an inverted carrot are a satellite dish and transceiver for 
ultraphone a system that is bringing telephone service to the 
navajos using radio instead of cables for about oneeighth the 
cost 
international mobile machines corp of philadelphia began 
working on what would become ultraphone in 1981 its first 
installation was in september 1986 for mountain bell in the 
douglas wyo area 
last november the federal communications commission decided 
that the time had come for radio to improve rural phone service 
organized a basic exchange telecommunications radio service and 
allocated frequency channels to it 
twenty companies or groups are investigating or have installed 
ultraphone from st lawrence county ny to the sparsely 
populated southwest mike said navajo communications introduced it 
in november on the 25000squaremile reservation a west 
virginiasized area that is home to 175000 people 
now demand exceeds supply he said navajos are up on 
technology they all have television and now theyd like phones 
theyre coming in here and saying we want telephone service now 
 
the key to ultraphone is digital radio technology using an 
encoder to convert voices into the computer or binary language 
for transmission as a radio signal beamed to a tower atop a mesa 
nine miles from chinle the signal is relayed to destination where 
it is decoded by a transceiver users converse over standard 
telephones the magic is in the means not the end 
the signal covers a circle with a radius of 37 miles so 
customers have the benefit of being able to make a 75mile local 
call bills run 15 to 23 per month for basic service mike said 
that presents a unique challenge for cecil jones navajo 
communications chinle service area manager whose job runs the 
gamut from marketing to helping customers make out checks to pay 
for the service 
i have to sit down and explain what a telephone bill is he 
said its very educational for us really something we need to 
do as a person the other thing is to explain to them the 
capabilities of the equipment the difference between a local call 
and long distance 
navajo communications has invested about 750000 in the system 
which currently has about 100 customers of 460 possible jones 
estimated it would cost at least 6 million to run wires into the 
same clusters of dwellings 
the company plans to cover most of the reservation most of 
northeastern arizona and parts of utah and new mexico with 
installations in its three other service areas based in window 
rock tuba city and shiprock nm 
ultraphone is the only digital system on the market said imm 
spokeswoman marcia bexley it offers improved transmission quality 
and the ability to timedivide a radio channel to allow four 
simultaneous conversations 
the big thing is spectrum efficiency we make the most out of 
the radio spectrum ms bexley said 
it relates to the cost because in radio channels are the 
cost said imm regional director kris shelton in denver who 
added that the digital format ensures privacy with a normal 
mobile radio you can sit with a broadcast scanner and listen in 
with digital all you hear is a hissing sound 
but spectrum efficiency signal splitting and security arent 
the important things to suzie randall i really like the service 
and its a communication i have with my kids she said in navajo 
translated by jones 
the only problem she said is neighbors who have no phones 
turning up with increasing frequency to make calls

jd mac macgillis motto gleaned from a 
lifetime in the us marine corps is simple see the hill take 
the hill 
it probably wont be that easy though when mac played by 
gerald mcraney in cbs major dad faces his biggest battle 
against a wisemouthed space alien who lives on a very large hill 
called nbc 
major dads assignment in the fall is to anchor cbs 
allcomedy mondaynight lineup its an uphill battle a succession 
of cbs halfhour comedies have tried and failed to make headway 
against nbcs powerhouse puppet alf in the 8 oclock eastern 
time period 
but after a second season in third place and with a schedule 
filled with aging hour dramas or new ones struggling to build an 
audience cbs desperately needs a breakout comedy it can move to 
another night 
the fate of two other new comedies will rely in part on the 
popularity of their leadin major dad will be followed by a 
new offbeat fantasycomedy the people next door sandwiched 
between last seasons hit murphy brown and the proven 
designing women which incidentally stars mcraneys new 
bride delta burke is the other new show the famous teddy z 
starring teen hearthrob jon cryer in a sophisticated comedy from 
the creator of wkrp in cincinnati and franks place the 
venerable newhart rounds out the night 
most of the television critics meeting here had a favorable 
reaction to the pilot for major dad in which the conservative 
macgillis and a liberal reporter for the local newspaper played by 
newcomer shanna reed fall in love at first sight and decide to 
marry he has no experience with children she has three daughters 
13 11 and 6 
in his first visit to their house 6yearold casey chelsea 
hertford peers at him out the window then runs excitedly to her 
mother to announce its gi joe elizabeth marisa ryan 13 
observes over dinner this guy has no hair 
major dad is not a show about the military said executive 
producer earl pomerantz who noted im a jewish person from 
canada and i know nothing about the marine corps which he said 
he had heretofore thought of not as fodder for comedy but just 
guns and sharp things 
i do people shows he told the television critics i 
like shows with people in them rather than pieces of felt 
thats what were on against a piece of felt said pomerantz 
referring to alf its doing very well alf wins its 
time period virtually every week 
pomerantz created the critically praised but shortlived best 
of the west was coexecutive producer of the cosby show and 
has written for the mary tyler moore show cheers and 
taxi among others he said it is impossible to sit down and 
create a show with the purpose of being a network hit 
in 1984 nobody thought cosby was going to be a hit all 
the questions were how are you going to beat magnum pi 
such a big hit he said 
pomerantz and mcraney who helped come up with the concept for 
major dad think the chemistry between the seemingly mismatched 
lovers will charm viewers 
i think a lot of people have a notion of a marine being about 
as far rightwing as you can go without becoming genghis khan and 
a lot of other people have the notion that journalists are about as 
leftwing as you can go without actually pledging allegiance to the 
red flag said mcraney 
so youve got these two extreme differences and the thing 
that we would like to carry out in this show is the notion that you 
can have divergent points of view but were all in the same game 
here maybe its too much of a cliche to say that love conquers 
all but it can conquer a lot 
much of the research for the show was conducted at camp 
pendleton in california and some outdoor scenes will be filmed 
there said pomerantz but most of it is filmed on a soundstage in 
front of an audience some of whom are marines he said 
a marine reserve officer is an adviser on the show and the 
extras are real marines said pomerantz because we couldnt get 
extras to get a haircut for 35 a day 
marines seem to like the show 
we showed this show to marines pomerantz said actually 
we didnt show it all of a sudden it was bootlegged all over the 
camps and so when we came down there they were already talking 
demographics and can we beat alf

at times deborah gore deans endorsement came 
full of enthusiasm 
this is a must a go i love this project she said in an 
april 1986 note about a proposal for a department of housing and 
urban development grant to help finance a baltimore project 
no matter how it was delivered ms deans endorsement carried 
considerable weight a fact not lost on hud and congressional 
investigators who question whether the woman who served as former 
hud secretary samuel pierces top lieutenant was qualified or 
authorized to make such decisions at all 
its amazing to see all the things that she signed most of 
which she had no authority to do said a new official at hud who 
asked not to be identified she does appear to have enjoyed 
considerable power 
as pierces executive assistant ms deans job ostensibly was 
to push the secretarys agenda and manage the daytoday affairs of 
his office 
but a review of her files at hud offers little evidence of a 
pierce agenda and ample evidence that ms dean whose position 
carried no management authority involved herself in a wide range 
of hud activities and considered hers to be the final word 
developers consultants and others who did business with hud 
during ms deans three years as executive assistant appear to have 
agreed with her selfassessment 
we are very appreciative of your assistance in expediting this 
matter former hud secretary carla hills said in a march 1987 
note to ms dean thanking her for her intervention on behalf of a 
hills client 
she has proven herself not only very capable of handling 
daytoday administrative matters but also of making the wheels of 
government turn in an expeditious manner thenrepublican rep 
trent lott of mississippi said in an april 1987 letter to pierce 
ms dean is a central figure in the current investigations of 
hud internal congressional and justice department reviews of 
allegations of fraud mismanagement and political cronyism at the 
agency during the reagan administration she came to hud after a 
brief stint as an energy department aide and prior to that was a 
parttime bartender and publisher of a lifestlye magazine 
the 34yearold daughter of a prominent republican family 
refused to testify when called before congress invoking her fifth 
amendment right against selfincrimination she also has declined 
through her attorney repeated recent requests for interviews 
she has according to sources offered to implicate pierce in a 
number of funding decisions in exhance for a grant of immunity but 
the subcommittee conducting the review has to date balked at the 
offer and sought to gather information about pierce through other 
witnesses there is nothing to indicate any impropriety by pierce 
but such testimony by ms dean would contradict pierces earlier 
sworn statement that he took no direct role in funding decisions 
ms deans files reviewed under provisions of the freedom of 
information act do indeed contain evidence pierce was more 
involved in certain hud decisions than he indicated in his 
congressional testimony 
letters kept by ms dean indicate pierce intervened on projects 
involving jazz musician lionel hampton former gop sen edward 
brooke of massachusetts and a mississippi state lawmaker 
but more abundant is evidence that those seeking help at hud saw 
ms dean as their problem solver equally abundant is evidence that 
she went to great lengths to keep in touch with prominent 
republicans and members of the reagan administration in between 
she wrote thankyou notes for the chocolates roses teddy bears 
and other gifts given her by associates and admirers 
the entreaties for help came from an array of sources 
developers consultants members of congress and on occasion the 
white house 
not all the mail however was complimentary 
it is not that i have never been lied to before rep gene 
snyder rkan said in a 1986 letter to ms dean protesting a 
decision affecting a project in his state i have been but not by 
my own administration 
also in the files is an angry letter from thennew hampshire 
gov john sununu to pierce protesting a newspaper article in which 
ms dean was said to have speculated that home prices in the state 
would drop if it had an income tax 
ms dean sent a letter of apology to sununu and said she had 
been misquoted he is now white house chief of staff 
another letter offers evidence that ms dean kept in touch with 
former allies at the agency who left to go into hudrelated 
business 
i have tried to keep all of the commitments that you made and 
that i made to you ms dean said in a 1985 letter to philip 
abrams one of a handful of hud officials who teamed up on a number 
of lucrative hud projects after leaving government 
in that same letter she wrote of a fight with shirley mcvay 
wiseman then an assistant secretary at hud over a new policy 
proposal shirley is impossible she wrote abrams 
three months later when pierce distributed a memo informing 
senior staff that ms wiseman was resigning ms dean could not 
control her glee 
across the note in inchhigh letters she scribbled yeah

bernard c duse jr never thought being 
black posed any problems he couldnt overcome 
i have always said whatever problems i will hit in that 
regard i will overcome that and i have always done that by simply 
working harder and putting my shoulder to the wheels to work 
harder to overcome that duse said 
his life seemed unlikely to prove him wrong until january 1984 
when he complained of racial discrimination at ibm his employer of 
14 years 
in the months that followed duses mental stability was 
questioned and he was falsely accused of sexual harassment 
security agents put him under aroundtheclock surveillance 
tailing his car and watching him through binoculars finally he 
was fired 
you cant overcome situations where people are paid hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to do the things that were done to me it 
was racially motivated in the extreme duse told stamford 
superior court judge sidney landau 
to be treated like some twobit drug dealer took my sense 
of self and flushed it down the toilet he said 
landau in may awarded duse a 4 million default judgment after 
one of the detective agencies that shadowed him didnt answer a 
lawsuit it was a largely moral victory because the firm lsi inc 
of fairfield is insolvent but duse 48 says the record is clear 
ibm was suffering from paranoia not him 
the damage done to my character has been considerable he 
said in an interview i will get a great deal of pleasure having 
these things exposed 
duse is suing ibm and seven former and current executives in 
us district court in new haven for alleged discrimination 
breach of contract invasion of privacy and trespassing he is 
seeking unspecified damages 
ibm which has earned praise for hiring and promoting blacks and 
this year was ranked by black enterprise magazine as one of the top 
50 places for blacks to work denies duses allegations and says it 
is eager to tell its side of the story in court 
ibm spokesmen said they could not respond to specifics because 
of an order the company sought from us district judge ellen burns 
barring access to much of the evidence and limiting what duse and 
attorneys can say 
but ibm doesnt dispute that its fears about a oncerising 
manager led to extraordinary security measures and surveillance 
costing more than 450000 
duse earned an engineering degree at the university of 
pittsburgh served two years in the army six months of it in 
vietnam as a platoon leader and as a company executive officer 
then went to work for procter amp gamble co as assistant manager of 
a regional data center in los angeles 
unsatisfied with the pace of advancement he left for harvard 
business school earning an mba in 1970 he was recruited by ibm 
which marked his rise with superior job ratings and a trip to 
middlemanager school in 1980 
but then things changed he didnt get an expected promotion 
his job rating dropped in august 1983 duses immediate boss 
james h beall jr was put in charge of a project duse says he had 
developed 
in january 1984 after duse told ibm through his attorney that 
he believed he was the victim of discrimination beall embarked on 
a campaign to harass and discredit him duse said beall said if 
it were up to him he would summarily execute me and twice 
commented about sending the ku klux klan to his home 
duse also contends beall was behind a sexual harassment 
complaint filed by a woman duse had hired ibm found that complaint 
to be groundless 
it also found duses charges against beall groundless and 
ordered him in may 1984 to stay away from work pending psychiatric 
examination 
an ibm psychiatrist said duse appeared to be suffering from a 
paranoid personality disorder and should work with different 
managers a psychiatrist picked by duse said he was 
obsessivecompulsive but that most executives if they are any 
good are obsessive compulsive and they are also hypomanic 
it was on the first weekend of his forced leave that duse 
started to suspect someone was following him he noticed suspicious 
cars parked on roads around his property then caught someone 
looking at his home with binoculars 
he returned to work in july 1984 to a nonmanagerial position 
filed his lawsuit against ibm that month and was fired in november 
ibm said duse had instilled fear of physical harm in people 
i know of no one who in any way ever told me my presence 
instilled fear in them duse said it might be just being black 
instills fear or it might be having served in vietnam instills 
fear i would recommend anyone who feels that way to get 
psychiatric treatment 
security agents who took part in the duse operation said they 
watched ibm offices in stamford and westchester county ny and 
the connecticut homes of three of duses bosses aroundtheclock 
starting in early may 1984 
investigative reports obtained by duse and his attorney david 
s golub in 1985 show that security agents kept close tabs on him 
one agent reported heading down duses driveway at 2 am on may 
11 1984 
two former members of one security detail who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said ibm officials became alarmed when duse 
applied to new cannan police in late april or early may 1984 for a 
permit to carry a weapon 
ibm was haunted by a 1982 attack in bethesda md the agents 
said edward mann a black former employee who had complained of 
racial discrimination years earlier went on a shooting rampage that 
may killing three people and wounding six mann hanged himself in 
1986 in a baltimore prison 
i remember that being an issue of why they were going to such 
great lengths said one of the agents a retired police officer 
they were afraid they might have another incident like in 
maryland 
duse who is divorced lives in a home in new canaan that sits 
100 yards from the road hidden by foliage he said he bought a 
smallcaliber handgun in midmay while on leave only because of 
the alleged klan threats 
i think the security apparatus at ibm was embarrassed at what 
happened in maryland and they had a chance with me to do several 
things showing top management they could carry out their security 
responsibilities duse said 
based on what happened in bethesda they probably considered 
all black males a potential danger we were not seen as 
individuals he said 
according to court documents ibm made nearly all of its 
payments for the duse operation to a virginia firm richard w 
kobetz amp associates duse also is suing kobetz and allfacts inc 
of briarcliff manor ny alleging invasion of privacy 
trespassing and unfair trade practices both deny any illegalities 
meanwhile the ordeal has taken a toll 
duse said he hasnt been able to find a comparable job he was 
making 72000 a year because he has been blacklisted he said he 
suffers continual headaches and difficulty sleeping and at one 
point considered suicide 
ibm lawyers say duse has not been serious about seeking a new 
job and ask why he has not seen a doctor for the health problems he 
claims 
a psychiatrist cannot give me back my good name and compensate 
me for the damages done to me or give me employment that is what i 
need duse said 
i take great pride in respecting the laws of the country the 
state the town and the rights of other people and to be treated 
in the way i was treated it simply is unconscionable he told 
landau i believe if i were white i would not have been treated 
that way

when leonhard wiegandt moved here 
nine years ago he thought he had found paradise 
i came up here and carefully picked this place because i 
wanted to be away from highways any kind of noise said 
wiegandt 52 who grazes 80 head of cattle on a 440acre spread in 
the peace and quiet of st lawrence county 
it is a paradise about to be lost 
strategic air command bombers flying out of four northeast bases 
will soon begin making 75 to 100 flights a month never on 
weekends as low as 500 feet along a training route that passes 
right over wiegandts barn 
the west german native already knows what it will be like living 
under ir806 as the air force calls the route in may the f111a 
fighterbombers and aging eightengine b52s made demonstration 
flights for two days 
almost every one of the planes went right deadcenter over my 
barn he said the cows got spooked broke down the gate and 
ran into the barn because of the noise id hate to be milking when 
they fly over id probably get my head kicked off 
the 440mile route begins over montpelier vt with the planes 
cruising at 7000 feet they enter new york at the northern tip of 
lake george begin to descend as they fly northwest past lake 
placid then head southwest to fort drum for bombing runs before 
heading out over lake ontario and home 
the planes are based at griffiss and plattsburgh air force bases 
in new york pease in new hampshire and loring in maine 
its extremely loud when you are directly underneath the 
flight path incredibly loud its painful said kathleen 
fitzgerald who moved here 13 years ago from new jersey to escape 
suburbia and big cities 
the northern fringe of the adirondacks is an area where i can 
confidently enjoy life where serious crime is not a substantial 
problem where the air is clean where the people care about the 
homey things in life said dick mooers deputy director of the 
st lawrence county planning office 
st lawrence county is vast its 2840 square miles make it 
larger than delaware farming is the main business 800 fulltime 
dairy farms and another 800 parttime farms dot the gently rolling 
countryside 
more than 95 percent of those farms are privately owned and 
farmers like wiegandt are constantly under pressure to produce 
more im working 16 hours a day every day he said 
physically i cant give no more the smallest thing that goes 
wrong on a farm is a hassle 
for many northern new yorkers lowflying planes are not new 
air force jets have been training over the adirondacks for 23 
years but in january the air force decided to modify a couple of 
the routes to allow flights as low as 400 feet a required 
environmental assessment was drawn up it concluded that no 
significant negative environmental impact would be felt 
however the assessment was perceived as superficial and the 
announcement brought a storm of protest from environmentalists 
concerned about maintaining the tranquility of the 6 millionacre 
adirondack park and the safety of such endangered species as 
peregrine falcons and bald eagles which nest there 
the air force compiled a second more detailed assessment and 
made changes that have relieved some of the apprehensions of park 
advocates after a meeting in june with local officials sac 
decided to raise the altitude to 1000 feet over parts of st 
lawrence county but the noise wont be appreciably cut 
the new proposal says planes will avoid the endangered species 
and other sensitive wilderness areas and shifts more flights onto 
ir806 which has an area the air force calls a racetrack a 
rounded triangle 30 miles wide that allows each plane to make three 
passes per flight over fort drum in an era of budget restraint 
that cuts costs and gives pilots more training per flight 
we need to use that range said sgt alan dockery a sac 
spokesman our bases in the northeast have to go a long way to 
ranges out west if they can have access to a range in the 
northeast where they can drop their training devices that will 
save us as much as 50000 on a b52 mission nowadays we have to 
pinch every dollar that gets expensive even for the air force 
but the proposal also means three passes over wiegandts farm 
youre talking an excess of 4000 planes flying over my place in 
a years time and if they dont fly over my place they fly over 
somebody elses he said 
the perception persists here that the air force hasnt done its 
homework 
hermondekalb central school is not mentioned they said they 
didnt know we were there complained school board president bob 
josephson well we have 600 kids in the school every day who 
know where we are 
the racetrack is over farms and forest land mooers said 
though 12500 people live directly under the flight path that 
even surprised us and there are six colleges with over 8000 
students 
there are also 76 amish families in the county who rely on 
horses for both transportation and agriculture he said horses 
frighten easily so there is a concern that noise from a lowflying 
jet might cause an accident people want to know who would end up 
paying if that happened 
noise isnt the only concern a string of accidents during 
lowlevel nato flights over west germany last year killed more than 
100 people 
i keep thinking that if they veered it wouldnt take much for 
them to land in my back yard hodge said theyre not very far 
above the ground it wouldnt take much just a little mistake for 
one to crash we know they hit the ground thats why theyre upset 
over in germany 
the air force plans to monitor the flights and assess their 
environmental impact for a year before sac decides on a longterm 
commitment 
wiegandt winces at the thought 
the funny thing is i like airplanes it used to be a hobby of 
mine when i was a kid i used to make all the models and i like to 
see them dont get me wrong we gotta have an air force and i 
think weve got the best air force in the world and they gotta 
train somewheres to keep em the best 
but thats not the point i was here first

when american dramatist richard nelson was asked 
to write a play for britains royal shakespeare company he set one 
condition there was no way i would write about english people 
that would be wildly presumptuous 
instead nelson chose as his topic a troupe of american 
academics leading a theater tour of england the result is some 
americans abroad the first play the statesubsidized rsc has 
ever commissioned from an american 
reviews have been mixed to favorable michael billington in the 
guardian thought it was beadily funny in nelsons 
characteristically wry ironic style 
but martin hoyle in the financial times found the play a 
frequently delicious joke that may be as insubstantial as dry 
ice adding had an englishman created these americans it 
would have been a case for the race relations board 
the play directed by roger michell had its world premiere july 
19 at the rscs small studio theater the pit located in the 
depths of londons barbican center it runs in repertory through 
sept 12 
it would have been easy for some americans abroad to pander 
to the cultural snobbism of some english intellectuals who love 
mocking american theatergoers for laughing in the wrong places or 
romanticizing anything british 
but the 38yearold nelson said in an interview that he was 
after greater complexity his characters are mostly duplicitous 
moneyobsessed and culturally bereft but the play he said deep 
down is about exile not only geographically but out of time these 
are people of a liberal consciousness adrift in a time when to be 
of the liberal left in the united states is very frustrating 
i never thought lets go bash on americans and really make 
fun 
an allbritish cast plays american tourists faculty mostly 
and several students who frequent theaters in london and 
stratforduponavon omnivorously feasting on a culture which it 
becomes clear they dont really understand 
chief among them are joe anton lesser an erstwhile leftist 
and cynical professor of english philip oliver cotton his 
broodingly handsome colleague accused of molesting one of the 22 
students on the tour and henry simon russell beale the young 
lecturer being quietly ousted from his job 
nelson said he wanted to explore attitudes towards culture i 
think we in america are by and large a country that is 
unconcerned about its own culture and the continuity of that 
culture 
we latch on to things that dont matter that we can put on a 
pedestal 
accordingly his characters sentimentalize plays whose titles 
they cant remember and in one especially peculiar scene appear 
on westminster bridge in the rain reciting william wordsworths 
celebrated poem about it 
the theme of exile physical and spiritual is common to 
nelsons plays between east and west seen in london in 1987 
examines the displacement of a czech theater director and his 
actress wife who have moved to new york from prague 
principia scriptoriae which ran offbroadway and at the rsc 
in 1986 is about an american writer in selfimposed exile to latin 
america 
principia was better received in london than new york and 
its acclaim prompted the rsc to commission the current play 
the two experiences ive had with the rsc have been the two 
best ive ever had with plays of mine said nelson who talks in 
the same anglophile terms that he derides in his new play 
the reaction here has been much more generous much more 
understanding he said my plays have been critically

lee iacocca the driver behind the 
restoration of chrysler corp and statue of liberty the irreverent 
executive whos done his own ads and gueststarred on primetime 
tv is content these days to sit back a little and take it easy 
letting others run the business 
but when it comes to key decisions at chrysler the 64yearold 
chairman is ready to assert himself over subordinates with 
undisputed authority 
i try not to get in their hair but i do iacocca said in an 
interview im trying to stay out the best i can but right now 
weve got a lot of tough tough decisions to make how do you 
prioritize 
he jumped right in this past week proclaiming a 1 billion 
costcutting program to make the automaker more competitive 
iacocca broke the news that chrysler will retire or lay off 2300 
of the companys 31000 salaried workers by yearend and said 
profitability must become a part of our culture 
company executives are confronting several problems a declining 
market share a slowing economy the relentless competition from 
japan and now korea improving the mix of vehicle models and 
allaying investor concerns 
chryslers secondquarter earnings are due monday analysts 
expect a slight increase over the 3204 million the nations no 3 
automaker made during the same period last year but they hedge the 
prediction because chrysler has spent so much on incentives to sell 
its cars and trucks 
through july 20 chryslers car and truck sales were running 8 
percent behind the pace of last year a worse showing than its big 
three rivals general motors corp and ford motor co 
theres little doubt the total market demand this year will fall 
well below the 158 million vehicles sold last year one of the 
best in industry history 
iacocca estimates sales between 135 million and 14 million 
vehicles this year the lowest estimate of the big three chairmen 
gms roger smith predicts about 15 million and fords donald 
petersen reckons about 147 million 
ive been saying this for a lot of years and its the old 
story ill have to be right one year were going to have to have 
a pause a recession iacocca said i thought it would be 
mid88 to mid89 i think i was off by a good solid year 
he predicted a tough time for the next 12 to 18 months but said 
chrysler the auto industry and the us economy are in better 
shape now than they were before the last big industry slump in the 
early 1980s 
we were worst of the three at that time but they gm and 
ford werent very far behind if this would have kept up he said 
in a move thats been written into the business history books a 
sickly chrysler beseeched the federal government for help in the 
late 1970s and eventually secured 15 billion in loan guarantees 
to survive 
under iacoccas guidance chrysler repaid the loans seven years 
early and he frequently talks about that with a mix of humor and 
bluntness 
when he first disclosed chryslers earlyrepayment plan at the 
national press club in washington in july 1983 iacocca told 
reporters we at chrysler borrow money the old fashioned way we 
pay it back 
nonetheless the company is still a bit wobbly and faces 
significant questions about its longterm direction 
measured by sales chrysler is becoming a truck company through 
the first six months of the year it sold more trucks than cars 
partly because of the trendsetting minivans the dodge caravan 
and the plymouth voyager and jeeps which chrysler got buy 
purchasing american motors corp in august 1987 
chrysler commands more than 55 percent of the minivan market 
which iacocca says will be impossible to hold because of 
competition from imports and a new line of gm minivans 
iacocca recalled when he introduced minivans in 1983 i 
remember some wiseass at ford said they are on dope over there 
they said it was a little nothing it was sort of a fad who would 
want a little van when they could get a big van 
what they forgot is that you werent going after the van or 
wagon owner you were going after the fourdoor sedan owner and 
theres 5 million of those a year 
whether theyre minivan buyers or not iacocca goes after them 
all many times personally 
since nov 1 1978 when he was fired as president of ford and 
went to chrysler with the same title hes become synonymous with 
chrysler 
iacoccas contract with chrysler runs through 1991 and he isnt 
saying whether hell stick around thereafter or want to 
ive got to do a lot in the next 2 years he said i 
always thought that compared with the japanese we put the good 
guys out 65 and over thats when theyre just coming into their 
own in japan i thing it is stupid the way we take assets and throw 
them out 
besides salary bonuses and stockoption rights iacocca will 
receive 225000 shares of chrysler common stock in 1990 and 1991 
worth at todays prices about 6 million 
he has withstood the wrath of the united auto workers union and 
others in the past for multimilliondollar annual earnings that 
critics have called obscene and unjustified the chairman not only 
hasnt apologized hes called his compensation the prize that 
comes with the task of saving a big company 
there is little iacocca wont do to create a friendly image for 
himself and chrysler 
hes appeared in television ads did a guest spot on miami 
vice and said in newspaper ads did we screw up you bet we 
did when the federal government nailed the company for odometer 
fraud 
his personal life has snared attention too he was involved in a 
wellpublicized divorce from his second wife peggy whom he 
married after the death of his first wife mary he nearly was 
drafted for president in 1988 and in perhaps one of the proudest 
efforts by the son of italian immigrants iacocca spearheaded the 
restoration of the statue of liberty 
like many of his other projects controversy swirled around the 
multimillion dollar rejuvenation of americas freedom symbol in new 
york harbor 
like other ventures iacocca said he learned from it in four 
years of the project iacocca became fed up with the infighting and 
red tape obstacles lobbed at him by washington bureaucrats 
i decided how would you like to go down there and do that 
for a living on everything so maybe its the best lesson i ever 
got he said if it hadnt maybe id have been stupid enough 
to run for president

hundreds of thousands of rural americans every 
year are giving up and moving to cities and suburbs frustrated by 
farming troubles or left without jobs when factories close many 
leave houses schools even whole towns abandoned to the winds 
congressional hearings on the crisis begin this week yet as one 
part of rural america disappears another part is hanging on even 
flourishing the town that attracts a shopping mall that happens 
to lie along an interstate route in this first story in an ap 
extra series rural crossroads midwest regional reporter 
sharon cohen and mountain states regional reporter tad bartimus 
look at the two rural americas 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
as unobtrusive as a church bell as final as a funeral notice 
the passing away of so much of rural america began with a 
goingoutofbusiness sign 
perhaps it appeared in a shoe store window or the florists 
shop where every bride of the past 50 years ordered her bouquet it 
happened because the railroad died the hotel closed jobs dried 
up folks moved on 
the vast stretch of america beyond the nighttime glow of 
cities where stars and a few street lights mean rural life has 
been shrinking and struggling for decades 
as the nation faces the 1990s farmers and smalltown citizens 
no longer live in the countryside found in a willa cather novel or 
on a norman rockwell canvas today there are two rural americas 
one is dying the other surviving often by its wits 
isolated oneindustry towns and backroads hamlets that once 
defined country are fading into history at the same time 
modern little communities with diverse economic foundations and 
fortuitous locations are going strong 
the remote rural areas that are falling farther and farther 
behind have little prospect for attracting industry said cynthia 
duncan associate director of the rural economic policy program of 
the aspen institute a think tank that does social and economic 
research rural areas that are closer to cities are more 
resilient and are going to recover faster 
the dying rural america is evident in the country school its 
oncewhite clapboards peeling gray in the unrelenting wind of the 
nebraska prairie and in the dilapidated homesteads of north dakota 
where roofhigh lilac bushes grow untended 
a way of life is disappearing when in montana a homemakers 
group cancels its annual mothers day tea because so few members 
remain 
but the other rural america the one that will survive has its 
symbols too 
aggressive communities in missouri and other states entice 
business with free land and other incentives in iowa little towns 
struggling to pay for police protection or individual schools are 
banding together in clusters that share the costs in texas 
the county with the largest quail population started organizing 
hunts that now attract hunters from 26 states 
if they can do it you can do it all over said david 
guarino of the texas department of agriculture which helped with a 
grant 
for almost two centuries the historical and emotional pull of 
rural and smalltown life put the heartbeat in the heartland the 
idealized myth of a homogeneous rural america where a family lived 
off a bountiful land shopped in a small town free of crime and 
perpetuated itself in prosperity and harmony through grit hard 
work and lofty moral principles goes back to the day the pilgrims 
landed 
thomas jefferson articulated the ideal holding that land 
ownership must be broadbased that democracy must be rooted in the 
individual efforts of small farmers and merchants 
and yet except for a brief rural renaissance in the 1970s 
when 45 million people fled the cities to earn livings in the 
country as coal and farming boomed much of rural life has been on 
a long decline 
in the 80s said calvin beale chief agriculture department 
demographer we simply do not see many of the 
backtothelanders homesteader or urban refugees who go out to 
upper michigan upper minnesota the ozarks northeastern new 
england to make their living in a smalltown community because they 
prefer to do it 
the 80s added new crises to old challenges tumbling land 
values farm foreclosures two droughts school consolidation 
falling commodity and petroleum prices deregulation and declining 
services a brain drain and a loss of jobs caused by mechanization 
factory closings and increased use of cheap third world labor 
the result has been an exodus to urban centers and dire 
predictions for the future 
unless action is taken virtually every citizen of the country 
will be forced to live in a metropolitan area said rep glenn 
english dokla whose house agriculture subcommittee opens 
hearings monday on rural development the first hearing is in 
clarksdale miss future hearings will be in amarillo texas 
marshalltown iowa and blackfoot idaho 
nearly 1 million people left rural america in 198687 that 
scenario is good for no one said english it would overburden 
our cities and suburbs as much as it would devastate our rural 
communities 
through the 80s rural america has witnessed a decline in 
services and jobs and a rise in poverty 
you can draw a lot of parallels between remote rural areas and 
the inner city said the aspen institutes duncan in both 
cases people with education and skills left you end up 
without a middle class without role models they dont have the 
economic security and economic opportunity they cant invest in 
the schools and good government at the local level 
television has let the rural poor know how different their 
lives are from the rest of the world said david lollis director 
of the federation of appalachian housing enterprises in kentucky 
propping up many dying small towns is the elderly retired 
population which lives off transfer payments such as pensions 
medical and disability insurance and income maintenance programs 
in nearly half of kansas counties in 1985 44 percent of income 
came from transfer payments or property income 
the world has changed and our population has aged said mary 
schissel city clerk in dougherty iowa a town of 128 a lot of 
our leaders want to take a break theyre in their mid to 
late60s they say its time for someone else to do this 
but who not young people of the hundreds of thousands leaving 
rural places in 198687 onethird were 18 to 24 years old more 
than half had at least one year of college 
the brain drain in rural areas is enormous said bob 
bergland agriculture secretary under president carter and now head 
of the national rural electric cooperative association the kids 
who stay are the ones who fail to graduate you cant get an 
employer who requires a high level of skill to come into a place 
with crummy schools 
and without jobs people leave 
if youve got a college degree about the only thing you can 
do is become a teacher or a nurse and there are dozens of 
applicants for every job said anne smith of bainville mont 
who spends her work week 100 miles from her husband so her 
teachers salary can help pay for their ranch 
hard times on ranches and farms in the early 80s also pushed 
many people off the land 
our biggest worry right now is that weve lost an entire 
generation of farmers said heather ball an economist with the 
texas department of agriculture you dont go out to rural texas 
and find young farmers anymore the whole future has packed up and 
moved away

its a new chapter in an old story farm population has been 
dropping since 1916 and and small towns have been struggling for 
more than a century said beale the agriculture department 
demographer he cites a book titled dead towns of georgia 
published in 1874 
new figures do provide a bit of good news for farmers who 
toughed out the 80s for 1988 agriculture department studies said 
net farm income was at a record high of 577 billion though some 
experts caution that a small percentage of largescale farmers 
account for a huge chunk of that 
also last year loan delinquencies reported by the farm credit 
system dropped 2 billion to half the level of two years ago two 
thousand farmers filed chapter 12 bankruptcies but that was less 
than a third of 1987s filings 
there is prosperity in some rural areas often in towns with a 
unifying core such as a county courthouse or a medical center 
usually near a major highway 
if your town isnt on an interstate forget it said james 
r shortridge a cultural biographer at the university of kansas 
development comes more quickly within 100 miles of a major 
trading center or a city bergland said 
for many small towns survival is assured with the arrival of a 
major merchandising center with an anchor store usually a walmart 
and yet this regional draw for one town often takes customers 
away from the main street retailers of surrounding communities 
rex campbell a university of missouri rural sociologist 
considers the spread of chain stores a major reason for the 
shifting rural landscape 
walmart is the innovator they know how to target growth and 
theyre expert marketers and mass merchandisers they were able to 
go into smaller markets than k mart or other competitors and now 
theyre replacing several momandpop businesses which formerly 
sold hardware dry goods clothes shoes and such 
after walmart and some other discounters moved into mason city 
iowa people in outlying towns noticed their business dropping off 
gene persons who has a grocery in sheffield 16 miles away 
acknowledged we sit here and try to do what we can to stop them 
theres only so many dollars to go around he and others have 
formed a commonwealth of neighboring small towns that pool 
resources to promote themselves 
for other pragmatic rural residents adapting means working in 
the city in order to live in the countryside 
some missourians for example drive 150 miles each way to the 
chrysler corp plant in the st louis suburb of fenton to earn 15 
an hour campbell said for every 1 of hourly wage theyll 
commute an average of 10 miles each way 
ultimately authorities say these approaches will not be enough 
to ensure the survival of many little towns they must rebuild 
their economies locally get access to investment money 
telecommunications transportation and educational opportunities 
perhaps most importantly they must diversify 
how does rural america participate in the growth of a 
serviceoriented economy thats the basic underlying question 
beale said it cant come out of agriculture it has to come of 
the industries driving the national economy 
rural residents must even look beyond that to the global 
economy whereas corporations in the 50s and 60s moved to rural 
america for cheaper labor now the third world market is even more 
enticing 
what it means for people is the same someone is out of a 
job a small town is dying said ann tickamyer assistant 
professor of sociology at the university of kentucky unless 
major efforts are taken to reevaluate what we want in a rural 
economy the prognosis is fairly grim 
a few residents perhaps will stay on in small towns that dont 
rethink and adjust that dont go looking for employers to 
diversify a oneindustry boomandbust economy 
those little places are never going to die there will always 
be a housing unit or so but theyll deteriorate campbell said 
what has been lost is the heart and what youre left with is the 
shell

at 40 bill hoch has been gone from 
his parents emporia dairy farm half his life but he says he 
carries its early lessons with him every day 
he believes many of his generation left rural life behind 
because they were profoundly influenced by global images conveyed 
through mass communications 
all of a sudden we started seeing things from around the 
nation around the world even from the moon for our parents that 
was the stuff of which daydreams were made not reality but for 
us it could become reality 
the mid to late 60s created an enormous almost magnetic pull 
on people like myself pulling us away from smalltown rural life 
the attraction was political social artistic but it all crested 
on the wave of the communications revolution 
hoch remembers growing up on the farm and delivering milk to 
small towns country schools and neighborhood farms that no longer 
exist 
when you look at rural life and how its changed in the last 
20 years its easy to get depressed he said i find it 
destructive and regrettable that so much has disappeared because 
beyond the economic impact the loss has created a vacuum 
now a resident of this suburb hoch regularly enjoys the 
concerts plays and sporting events kansas city offers and id 
be reluctant to give that up i enjoy the amenities of a city he 
says he needs the metropolitan environment for his communications 
business 
but he and his wife ellen visit emporia frequently his 
hometown 100 miles southwest of kansas city has grown from 15000 
residents when he lived there to about 30000 today 
theres an enormous sense of stability in knowing my family 
still lives on that same 100 acres weve owned for the better part 
of a century 
hochs pet pony rusty died only a few years ago at the age of 
35 and was lovingly buried in his corral near the ancestral home a 
baby raccoon he rescued from a city tree was turned loose to roam 
free in his parents pastures the pull of the place where wheat 
still grows and coming home for christmas is expected remains 
strong for bill hoch 
there used to be dozens of trucks and cars coming and going 
every hour to the dairy now mom and dad go to town once a day and 
thats the only dust churned up in the driveway even town has 
changed it used to be 10 miles away now its grown so much its 
only three or four miles to the outskirts 
hoch is grateful for the values he learned in his first two 
decades on the farm he credits them as the foundation upon which 
hes built his urban life 
i never turned away from the farm i just physically left i 
wrestled with the choices on the one hand there were dependable 
stable values and a very predictable way of life on the other was 
the excitment and challenge of the unknown 
i never intended to stay away i always thought i would go 
back i still think that

farming reached an apex in 1916 and the population has been 
falling since in the early and mid 1980s rising interest rates 
and declining land values contributed to an exodus that saw more

the fading smalltown economy the early 80s recession the 
movement of factory jobs to the third world and increasing 
mechanization in coal mining agriculture timber and paper mills 
have shrunk employment opportunities 
from 1979 to 86 rural areas lost 733000 manufacturing mining 
and farm jobs the government reports 
unemployment in nonmetro areas averaged 69 percent for 1988 
compared with 51 percent in metro areas in 1979 the metro 
jobless rate was higher 
another major shift in rural america has been the dramatic rise 
of farm women in the labor force in the past two decades according 
to 1980 census figures more than half of all farm women worked 
outside the home 78 percent in a university of nebraska 
sevenstate study said economic reasons drove them into their new 
jobs in 1940 121 percent of farm women were in the labor force

american hospital association said 
medicare payments to rural hospitals are smaller than to urban 
ones based on the premise that services cost less one result is 
many small facilities have drastically cut the level of care or not

between 1970 and 1980 the annual rate of population growth in 
rural america was 14 percent compared with 1 percent in urban 
areas 
in the first half of the 1980s rural population grew at an 
annual rate of 07 percent compared with 12 percent in urban 
areas 
during the 70s rural areas experienced a net inmigration of 
about 350000 people each year in contrast there was a net exodus 
of 632000 people in 198586 and 952000 in 198687 
about a third of the 8687 loss was in the 1824 age group 
more than half the adults who left rural areas in that period had 
at least a year of college almost 27 percent had four years 
these figures are from the 1988 rural poverty report by the 
population reference bureau rural refers to nonmetro counties 
those not surrounding large cities about twothirds of the 
nations counties are nonmetro but they have only 23 percent of 
the population

arthur and marion vassmer ordered a shipment 
of woodstock key chains and cigarette lighters for their general 
store in plenty of time for any crowds this year 
its what they didnt order 20 years ago this summer that still 
causes a few pangs of regret 
the shelves of their country store were nearly stripped bare 
that august 1517 when about a half million youngsters camped out 
nearly two miles away at the woodstock music festival 
for one long weekend vassmers open since 1901 on the shores of 
white lake to serve residents of this 6000population town 
operated like an exclusive nightclub bouncers stood at the front 
door and let customers in a few dozen at a time to shop 
if id known i would have had 50 cases of peanut butter up 
front and said there you go take all you want said arthur 
vassmer 
the vassmers never made it up to yasgurs farm during the 
woodstock festival in 1969 when flower children frolicked in the 
mud and listened to the who jimi hendrix santana and others they 
were too busy 
but they could hear the music wafting through the air at all 
hours of the day and night i didnt believe it would come off 
marion vassmer said and i still dont believe it was here 
the vassmers remember kids abandoning their cars in town late 
thursday night sitting on hoods and playing guitars and camping 
out in the streets and nearby fields at night 
vassmers the closest store to the festival site hadnt even 
ordered any extra provisions all of their canned goods were prized 
items along with the peanut butter despite the crowds arthur 
said he doesnt remember any shoplifters and none of the 25 checks 
he cashed bounced 
they didnt bother anybody marion said they were no 
problem im sure a lot of them were on drugs but they helped each 
other out if one kid didnt have enough money someone else would 
give him some 
arthur vassmer said he dropped about 12 pounds over three days 
mostly because he couldnt bear to turn on his light and cook 
something in his apartment above the store with so many hungry kids 
on the street below 
the couple love reminiscing about the festival with visitors 
but they know enough not to bring up the name woodstock to 
longtime bethel residents 
its not a good topic for conversation because people who were 
against it they still feel the same way they did then said 
marion vassmer 
bethel and the surrounding catskill mountain region has let it 
be known theyre not particularly sentimental for the 20th 
anniversary bethel refused offers from promoters to be host to an 
anniversary concert even when businessmen dangled enticements such 
as paying for a new town sewer system 
town officials are expecting several thousand people to show up 
at the former yasgur farm for the anniversary 
the concert was originally planned for the town of woodstock 
about 50 miles away but moved when promoters couldnt get 
permission to hold it at woodstock today cynical store owners 
sell tshirts with a map of the area making clear the festival took 
place in bethel not in the famous arts colony 
the vassmers are part of a contingent of bethel residents who 
wish the town could cash in on its place in history by more 
actively seeking tourists but antifestival opinion has held sway 
arthur vassmer said some people still wander into the general 
store and recognize him from the movie woodstock in which he 
was interviewed some even ask for autographs which still leaves 
him tickled his store with the worn wooden floorboards hasnt 
changed much since 1969 
times have though and thats why he cant see a repeat 
performance of woodstock 
today you couldnt do it he said its a different 
attitude these people were the peace people they came up here for 
love and peace and music and thats what they got

last years drought put the squeeze on dairy 
farmers but agriculture department analysts say that 1988 milk 
production still set a record and that another boost can be 
expected this year 
the brighter outlook for milk producers comes as congress begins 
work to replace the expiring 1985 farm law the 1990 farm bill as 
its predecessor will have to contend with dairy price supports 
long a foundation of the industry 
relatively high milk prices and falling feed costs are the main 
reasons cited by the departments economic research service in a 
new dairy outlook report despite the bullish view there are a few 
caveats 
the past year may have sapped the financial strength of some 
producers the report said although higher milk prices 
compensated producers fairly fully for rises in concentrate grain 
prices forage costs in most areas also were sharply higher 
this financial strain may have been particularly acute for 
those producers who expanded in late 1988 in spite of the drought 
or were somewhat weak financially before the drought 
farm milk prices in the second quarter averaged 1220 per 
hundredweight up 77 cents from apriljune of last year cow 
slaughter has remained high and growth of milk output per cow has 
slipped 
but analysts said that if dairy farmers can recover quickly from 
the recent slump as they expect will happen total milk output 
in 1989 could exceed last years level by 1 billion to 3 billion 
pounds 
specifically the agency forecasts 1989 milk output at 1472 
billion pounds up from the record of 1455 billion last year 
the average price received by farmers in june was 1210 per 
hundredweight of milk up 80 cents from a year earlier and the 
highest june price since 1985 the report said thus far in 
1989 milk prices have averaged 82 cents more than a year ago 
if prices go as expected from here on the 1989 average of 
prices paid to dairy producers would be the highest since the late 
1960s the report said 
the boost for dairy farmers has not been without its cost to 
consumers retail prices of dairy products continued to post the 
largest yeartoyear rises of recent years the report said in 
june the retail dairy index was up 6 percent from a year earlier 
however yeartoyear increases during the second half may not 
be as large as during the first half the report added for the 
year retail dairy prices are expected to rise 5 percent to 6 
percent the largest since 1981 
department economists predict that consumer food prices overall 
may rise an average of 4 percent to 7 percent in calendar 1989 
at a house agriculture committee hearing july 12 the head of 
one of the nations most effective farm lobbying groups the 
national milk producers federation said the dairy industry is in 
a vastly different position than it was when the current law 
was debated four years ago 
gone are the burgeoning surpluses of dairy products purchased 
under the dairy price support program said federation president 
tom camerlo gone also is the 2 billionplus price tag of the 
dairy program 
camerlo noted that us milk production and consumption are in 
close balance as a result he said usda has not had to buy any 
cheese or nonfat dry milk this year to bolster market prices 
however usda says that there have been heavy butter purchases 
by the commodity credit corp and that some probably will be bought 
in the second half of the year 
according to a review of usda spending operations ccc spending 
on dairy programs in the fiscal year that began last oct 1 will be 
about 658 million which camerlo said will be a far cry from the 
21 billion cost of the program as recently as 1985 
one reason for the reduction in dairy program costs has been an 
insistence by congress and the administration to roll back some of 
the milk price supports from their record highs of the early 1980s 
at that time the high supports and rising production caused ccc 
surplus inventories of dairy products to grow which added to the 
costs of operating the program in 1983 for example the support 
program cost a record 27 billion 
fees were levied against dairy producers and other steps taken 
to ease some of the growing financial burden and the 1985 farm law 
authorized a dairy termination program to reduce production and 
program costs the 18 billion program began april 1 1986 and 
lasted for 18 months with producers themselves paying about a 
third of the cost 
under the 18month dtp which also was called the wholeherd 
buyout program the department paid participating farmers to 
dispose of entire herds either through slaughter or export and to 
remain out of dairying for five years more than 16 million dairy 
cattle were cut from the us herd 
a report by the general accounting office an investigative 
agency of congress said earlier this month that the dtp will 
reduce milk production from 1986 through 1990 by 394 billion 
pounds below what it would have been without the program 
but the gao report also said that the dairy buyout will not 
have a lasting effect on milk production 
thus the report said it is difficult to predict the benefits 
or costs of a similar program that might be used to address future 
dairy surplus problems

john f kennedy used to say that a rising tide 
lifts all boats but the opposite apparently is not true a 
fouryear study by nearly 100 researchers has concluded that when 
the tide goes out of the nations economy the poor sink fastest 
and deepest 
the experts found that something happened in america about 1973 
the tide reversed stagnation set in the years since have been 
rough on americans at the bottom and in the middle white or black 
a generation ago a man with low skills could easily get a 
bluecollar job that paid enough to raise a family today those 
jobs if available pay poverty level wages 
among blacks and whites alike what is paid to those near the 
bottom buys less in 1986 than 1969 
whats more the poor may be getting poorer in the 1980s the 
average poor family has persistently had a yearly income further 
below the poverty line than any year since 1963 the report said 
thats a central finding in a common destiny blacks and 
american society a 600page report issued this past week by the 
national research council an arm of the congressionalchartered 
national academy of sciences and engineering 
the study its 27 million cost mostly absorbed by private 
foundations is billed as the most comprehensive look at the status 
of black americans since the 1968 kerner commission report that 
was the one which said america was moving toward two societies 
one black one white separate and unequal 
but the picture is not all bleak 
the report concludes that in fighting poverty nothing works 
like work and more jobs for the poor are coming 
economic opportunity alone will not solve all problems of 
course but it is the essential ground for other constructive 
developments it says all the evidence reviewed in this report 
points to the central importance of jobs for men and women at pay 
levels that permit families to live above the poverty line 
because of population trends people of working age are becoming 
scarce employers will have to hire those they now shun they may 
be forced to do what schools and society havent to prepare those 
at the bottom for jobs 
as a result says study director gerald jaynes a yale 
economist the opportunities for launching a successful 
nationwide effort to ameliorate the problems of poverty and 
underachievement may in fact be greater now than at any time in the 
recent past 
another central conclusion race relations in american and the 
status of blacks are much better than they were before world war 
ii but almost all the progress occurred before 1970 especially 
during the civil rights revolution of the 1960s and the great 
society 
and another white people by and large want black people to 
advance in principle thats a giant improvement since the end of 
world war ii when most whites were satisfied with the 
segregationist status quo but white people wont put their 
principles into practice they resist integration especially in 
housing 
and another conclusion probably controversial there is no 
truth to the belief that poor and segregated people develop habits 
and beliefs and values that lock them into poverty 
the name for that supposed phenomenon is the culture of 
poverty the assumption that ways of living poor are passed along 
from generation to generation so that children know no other way 
have no work habits develop no ambition 
people who think a culture of poverty exists say the poor are 
selfindulgent need instant gratification cant sacrifice or plan 
for the future dont think that education will do them any good 
not so argues the report looking at the lives of the poor 
shows that many are hardworking people who save when they can 
endure numerous deprivations worry about the future and urge 
their children to do well in school and on the job 
work for pay that will support a decent living standard is 
a central value among lowincome black men and women 
and many people move in and out of poverty several times over a 
lifetime if poverty were instilled in them they wouldnt or 
couldnt 
so theres hope the report suggests government programs can 
help changes in behavior by white people toward black people can 
help prosperity can help most

the discovery channel will become the latest 
cable tv programmer to scramble its satellitedelivered signal to 
fend off video pirates a company official said 
the landover mdbased company will begin scrambling its signal 
june 30 1990 said sandy mcgovern senior vice president of 
affiliate sales and relations 
socalled basic cable services such as cnn headline news espn 
and usa network already are scrambling their signals as are pay 
cable services such as home box office cinemax showtimethe movie 
channel and the disney channel 
backyard satellite dish owners and cable tv systems must have 
proper equipment to decode the scrambled signals 
mcgovern said thursday the company did not know how much 
business it was losing to theft but she said it counts 43 million 
paying subscribers while the ac nielsen ratings company reports 
a few million more homes than that are watching 
so we know theres some fairly significant theft she said 
scrambling began in january 1986 when hbo first encoded its 
signal more cable companies followed suit much to the dismay of 
backyard satellite dish owners many of whom paid about 2000 for 
their equipment 
congress passed the satellite home viewer copyright act last 
year guaranteeing access to the scrambled signals to backyard dish 
owners as long as they have paid for them 
the law was a boon to a new group of cable tv middlemen who put 
together packages of cable channels and sell them to satellite dish 
owners for monthly or yearly fees 
despite the scrambling however the cable industry claims it 
still loses millions of dollars to illegal decoding devices 
the discovery channel which began service in june 1985 offers 
nonfiction entertainment in the areas of nature science 
technology history and exploration 
it typically is provided to cable subscribers as part of basic 
packages of cable channels with the cable system operator paying 
the discovery channel a fee per subscriber

company rose to 25 billion from 23 billion 
the company which has been the object of heavy takeover 
speculation in the stock market during recent weeks also announced 
that its board of directors amended uals poison pill 
antitakeover plan to make it tougher for a hostile bidder to buy 
the company 
deltas fourthquarter profit was 1908 million or 387 a

last year revenue totaled 231 billion up from 19 billion a 
year ago 
usair reported net earnings of 1007 million or 229 a share

ual reported higher operating expenses and declines in both 
revenue passengers and revenuepassenger miles resulting in a 1 
percent drop in operating earnings 
spokesman rob doughty said he did not know how the crash last 
week of a united jetliner in sioux city iowa would affect uals 
thirdquarter results there would be expenses of course but we 
really havent seen an impact on revenue so far he said 
uals original shareholder rights plan adopted in 1986 granted 
shareholders the right in the event of a threatened takeover to 
purchase for 185 one onehundredth of a share of a new series of 
junior participating preferred stock and two shares of common stock 
for each share of common stock they already owned the amended plan 
changes the commonstock ratio to three for one 
such plans typically are used to make a hostile takeover 
prohibitively expensive by creating more stock for a suitor to 
acquire 
uals stock has risen sharply in the past month on takeover 
speculation doughty declined to comment on takeover rumors 
ual reported a 71 percent drop in net income for the first six 
months of 1989 to 2065 million or 955 a share from 701

its been called black gold and for a 
little company in louisiana the thousands of gallons of oil that 
the exxon tanker valdez spilled into alaskas prince william sound 
have proven to be just that 
oil mop inc which makes systems to clean up soak up and 
remove oil from water says its profits have increased sharply and 
that it expects to make 4 million this year double the 1988 
figure 
it has boosted permanent employees from 15 to 50 and hired an 
additional 50 temporary workers and announced plans to expand its 
manufacturing facility by 80 percent 
theres no doubt about it the cleanup operation in alaska is 
the reason were booming said general manager wallace landry 
exxon disclosed earlier this week that its estimated cleanup 
cost for the march 24 spill would total 128 billion making it 
one of the most expensive industrial accidents in history 
the giant oil company said the figure represented the price for 
3000 workers running hundreds of vessels and pumping equipment in 
alaska 
landry said oil mop is one of at least 100 small companies that 
have benefited from the cleanup operation in louisiana where the 
depressed oilbased economy has hurt many companies the spill has 
been a boon 
a lot of equipment and people that probably would not be 
working right now are employed because of the spill it will end 
of course but i would envision staying in a pretty fastpaced mode 
for at least another two months landry said 
companies that supply tow boats pumps and generators as well 
as service and catering companies are all busy landry said 
oil mop founded in 1970 is not new to the job of cleaning up 
major spills the company helped clean up the ixtoc i well blowout 
on mexicos bay of campeche in 1979 which spewed 100 million 
gallons of crude and ranks with the exxon spill as one of the worst 
oil disasters 
oil mops technicians had to recover diesel fuel from beneath 
three feet of ice to clean up a spill in nome alaska when a 
tanker went aground in the st lawrence seaway the company 
recovered 100000 gallons of oil in seven days 
the oil mop system uses a rope made of a fiber that attracts oil 
and repels water an engine pulls the rope across the water surface 
then and between rollers that squeeze the recovered oil into a 
container 
its really simple landry said the rope goes out for 100 
feet or so and then its pulled back through grandmas old fashion 
wringer 
the companys manufacturing operation is running three shifts 
24 hours a day to meet the demand for its products the fiber is 
whirled around special looms to form the mops and then attached to 
10 and 15 foot sections of rope the ropes are then strung together 
in 100 foot lengths oil mop is shipping thousands of feet of the 
rope mops and dozens of wringer mop engines and wringers to alaska 
oil mop plans to work in the oil industry program petroleum 
industry response organization which is being designed to take 
aggressive action in preventing oil spills responding to oil 
spills and conducting spillrelated research 
in addition the program will provide the equipment in the event 
of a major oil spill the anticipated initial outlay for the plan 
will be 70 million to 100 million plus annual maintenance of 
between 30 million and 100 million oil mop expects to get part 
of that 
the oil spill business is a funny business i guess you could 
say one companys poison is our meat weve shown that we can 
respond to a clients needs with the new attention any spill is 
going to get youd better be able to do that if you can it pays 
off landry said

no part of chrysler corp will be sacred as a 
costcutting knife carves 1 billion from the automakers expenses 
in the next 15 months executives say 
chairman lee iacocca told chryslers top 700 managers in a 
regularly scheduled meeting thursday that the company was embarking 
on a program that will result among other things in a reduction 
of its whitecollar work force by 83 percent or about 2300 jobs 
by the end of this year 
the cuts were mandated by lowerthanexpected vehicle sales 
levels rising costs especially in sales incentives and forecasts 
of a softening economy as the 1990s begin said bennett bidwell 
chairman of chrysler motors corp the companys vehiclemaking arm 
it is not a recession kneejerk reaction he said weve 
got to get costs out to get competitive 
bidwell said the company has a budget this year of about 26 
billion and a 1 billion cut is a big deal 
industry analysts had mixed reactions 
ron glantz of montgomery securities inc of san francisco 
doubted whether much of the cut would show up in chryslers profits 
this is an industry that kills to take a dollar out of the 
cost of building a car he said not very much of this 
billiondollar reduction is going to flow to the bottom line they 
are going to have to reduce advertising and marketing which will 
hurt sales 
but scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co inc in new york told 
the new york times that the move should boost earnings 
if they can cut 1 billion in a little over a year that would 
be a super achievement with a profound impact on their bottom 
line he said 
each of the big three automakers has been involved in 
costcutting programs of some scale many of the programs stemmed 
from the tough times the companies weathered in the early 1980s 
the cuts industry officials and analysts have said put the 
companies in better positions to withstand vehicle sales slumps or 
other economic pressures such as rising interest rates or flagging 
consumer confidence 
at chrysler employees 55 years and older with more than 10 
years of company service will be offered early retirements and 
buyouts to get them off the payroll 
bidwell said the personnel cuts will begin in about six weeks 
possibly decreasing whitecollar employment levels in some 
operations by up to 25 percent 
nothing is hands off he said 
meantime the company expects to save money through a voluntary 
paycut plan linked to chrysler stock prices and progress on the 
overall costcutting program 
in essence the plan would ask 2000 salaried workers to reduce 
their pay 5 percent to 15 percent with the money going into the 
company coffers the money would be repaid in 15 months on a 
sliding scale linked to the stock price if costcutting reaches 
at least half of its goal 
if the program is less successful than that the employees would 
forfeit the money 
bidwell and chrysler chief financial officer robert s miller 
said it was unknown how much money the plan would save chrysler in 
the short term but it would be in the millions of dollars 
we put this together last night bidwell told reporters 
thursday afternoon 
elsewhere in the corporation managers were told to tighten some 
already tight belts bidwell said the company had just conducted a 
study of job redundancy and fluff indicating where savings could 
be made 
the company whose two other divisions operate financial 
services and gulfstream aerospace may cut its advertising 
marketing and sports event promotions budgets he added 
weve got to go after everything that walks he said

in a move to streamline its marketing efforts 
rj reynolds tobacco co fired mccannerickson as the advertising 
agency for its winston and camel cigarette brands in the united 
states 
the tobacco company based in winstonsalem nc said thursday 
it was assigning the two brands to two agencies that already handle 
other domestic cigarette advertising assignments for reynolds 
fcbleber katz partners the new yorkbased agency that handles 
advertising for reynolds salem and vantage brands has been 
assigned the winston brand 
young amp rubicam another new york agency which handles the more 
and now accounts has been assigned the camel brand the changes 
are effective oct 30 
the dismissal came as a surprise to mccannerickson a new 
yorkbased agency that also creates ads for cocacola co and 
american telephone amp telegraph co agency insiders said reynolds 
never told the agency it was reviewing the brand assignments before 
telling them of the decision wednesday 
but peter j hoult executive vice president of marketing for 
reynolds said the consolidation of advertising business will 
allow us to streamline our marketing efforts and to more 
efficiently meet our overall objective of strengthening our 
cigarette business 
the company refused to disclose how much it spends on 
advertising either brand but one industry source said that 
advertising spending in the first quarter would extrapolate to 
about 45 million for the year another source however said the 
company spent twice that much on the two brands in 1988 
while the brand reassignments came as a surprise to the 
agencies one advertising executive said changes were expected in 
the wake of the massive 245 billion leveraged buyout completed 
earlier this year of reynolds parent rjr nabisco inc the buyout 
by the new york investment house kohlberg kravis roberts amp co left 
rjr with huge debts and new management 
betsy annese a spokeswomen for reynolds tobacco said the ad 
agency shift has nothing to do with the lbo 
the winston brand has been losing ground in the battle for 
market share in the cigarette business mccannerickson got the 
winston assignment in 1985 and winstons market share has since 
slipped to 104 percent from 112 percent 
each percent of market share is worth about 366 million in 
retail sales ms annese said 
mccanns most recent campaign approach pitched winstons 
winning taste 
mccann developed a hip new joe camel figure with the theme 
smooth character for camel last year but the brand has been 
mired for the past five years at 44 percent to 45 percent of the 
market mccann won the camel assignment in 1983 
mccann continues to handle foreign cigarette advertising 
assignments for reynolds and handles its domestic direct marketing 
in addition mccann has advertising responsibilities for other rjr 
divisions including ritz crackers and wheat thins and del monte 
canned fruits 
mccannericksons total billings amounted to 675 million at the 
end of 1988 
fcbleber katz partners a unit of foote cone amp belding 
communications has had the vantage ad assignment since the 
cigarette was introduced 20 years ago it received salem in 1986 
young amp rubicam has handled now and more cigarette advertising 
since 1986 and has been running test market advertising for 
chelsea cigarettes since april 
reynolds also has a third ad agency long haymes amp carr which 
is responsible for doral magna and the companys special events 
advertising

the commerce department says a preliminary 
investigation showed manufacturers in japan taiwan and south korea 
were dumping smallbusiness telephone equipment in the united 
states at prices far below their fair value 
in a preliminary finding thursday that could lead to hefty 
antidumping duties on these phone products the departments 
international trade administration said equipment prices in japan 
were as much as 2 times higher than the prices being charged in 
the united states for comparable equipment 
the us international trade commission in february also made a 
preliminary determination that the three nations practices had 
harmed us manufacturers 
dumping is a practice in which overseas companies sell their 
products in other countries at prices near or below cost in order 
to force their way into a market the difference between the 
average domestic and average foreign prices of a product is called 
the margin and is expressed as a percent 
companies found guilty of dumping must pay the margin in the 
form of duties collected by the us customs service to bring the 
cost of the imported item up to its fair market value 
the ita established the following margins for japanese 
companies toshiba corp 13677 percent matsushita 17893 
percent and all others 15785 percent 
for taiwan the companies and margins were taiwan nitsuko 
12973 percent sun moon star 0 percent and all others 12973 
percent 
for south korea they were samsung 933 percent goldstar 
609 percent and all others 779 percent 
after notice of the ita finding is published in the federal 
register a process that may take about five days antidumping 
duties will be levied on the products 
but the duties will be held in escrow pending a final 
determination by the ita which is expected by about oct 10 and 
pending a separate final determination by the international trade 
commission 
the itc must find that us businesses were injured by the 
dumping and a final determination is expected by midnovember itc 
spokesman jim craig said 
the us investigation was prompted by a complaint filed in 
december by american telephone amp telegraph co and condial corp 
atampt claimed it and other us phone manufacturers had been 
injured by unfair pricing practices of 12 manufacturers in the 
three countries 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the ita finding represents 
major progress on the way to the ultimate result atampt seeks the 
elimination of unfair pricing in the united states 
atampt said the foreign manufacturers had captured about 60 
percent of the us market for small business phone systems 
growing from about 40 percent in three years atampt and its us 
competitors claimed their business in that area had declined 
dramatically in the interim 
the ita said imports of certain smallbusiness phone systems and 
subassemblies from japan in 1988 were valued at 7757 million 
from taiwan 342 million and from south korea 227 million

a much larger soybean crop will mean lower 
prices for growers but some relief for users according to a new 
agriculture department report 
the departments economic research service said thursday the 
assessment was based on the july 12 estimate of 613 million acres 
planted to soybeans this year and a projected harvest of 195 
billion bushels up 27 percent from 1988 output 
analysts said the soybean crush in 198990 could climb to 1115 
billion bushels from 107 billion expected for 198889 
soybeans are crushed by processors into highprotein meal for 
livestock feed and oil for cooking and other food use 
exports too should rise next year but at a forecast 600 
million bushels will lag the larger volumes of the early 1980s 
the report said 
by the end of the next marketing year aug 31 1990 soybean 
inventories are expected to be about 265 million bushels up from 
125 million bushels at the beginning of the season sept 1 
as a result of the larger crop this year soybean market prices 
are expected to decline to an average of 475 to 625 per bushel 
in 198990 from an estimated 735 this season 
the larger soybean crush in 198990 will allow the united 
states to maintain soybean meal exports at the current level of 
about 55 million tons and still meet an expected increase in 
domestic demand the report said 
soybean meal prices may drop to an average of 140 to 180 per 
ton in 198990 from this years estimated 230 per ton 
however burdensome supplies of soybean oil will keep yearend 
inventories at above 2 billion pounds for the third straight year 
domestic oil use has lagged because substitute oils have been 
widely available and aggressively priced the report said 
exports of soybean oil in 198990 could be slightly below this 
years 143 billion pounds and will be shipped mostly under us 
assistance programs 
looking at other oilseeds the report said peanut plantings of 
168 million acres are expected to produce 45 billion pounds of 
peanuts this year up from 166 million acres and 398 billion 
pounds in 1988 
domestic food use of peanuts is expected to reach a record of 
225 billion pounds this season based on strong increases for 
peanut butter and salted nuts the report said peanut exports are 
projected at 650 million pounds 
sunflower plantings are down 12 percent from last year to about 
182 million acres even so sunflower seed production is projected 
at 105 million metric tons of 2205 pounds each up 205000 tons 
from last years droughtstricken crop 
corn oil production for 198889 is estimated at 15 billion 
pounds up 5 percent from last season the report said 
domestic use is expected to increase 13 percent to 12 billion 
pounds but exports are forecast to decline 10 percent to 331 
million pounds corn oil production in 198990 is forecast at 155 
billion pounds up 3 percent from this year

the agriculture department says the war 
against foliageeating gypsy moths has gained in oregon but has 
lost ground in north carolina and utah 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said thursday that oregon has been 
removed from the gypsy moth quarantine list because the pest has 
been eradicated from lane county which had been the insects 
toehold in the state 
federal quarantine regulations restrict the interstate movement 
of outdoor household articles lawn furniture and certain camping 
equipment for example that might harbor moths and spread them to 
other states 
based on treatments and subsequent surveys we have determined 
that the gypsy moth no longer occurs in lane county and that 
there is no further need to restrict the movement of outdoor 
household articles from this area 
lane county was the only quarantined area in oregon so the 
state has been removed from usdas official list of gypsy moth 
states 
meanwhile glossers agency is designating all or portions of 
currituck and dare counties in north carolina as gypsy moth 
lowrisk areas thus adding north carolina to the list 
glosser said inspectors have found the counties are infested by 
the moths but that the number of egg masses per acre is not high 
enough for them to be rated as highrisk areas 
by agency reckoning an area is highrisk when it has more than 
50 masses of moth eggs per acre 
glosser said a portion of salt lake county utah is a highrisk 
area and that this adds the state to the moth list

workers at nissans smyrna plant 
rejected the united auto workers by a 21 margin because of 
expansion plans and a continuing honeymoon period with the 
company industry and labor analysts say 
nissan motor manufacturing corp usa workers voted 1622711 
to keep the union out officials announced thursday the uaw has 
not organized any of the three fully japaneseowned auto plants in 
the united states 
i think theres certain peculiarities to the nissan situation 
that contributed to this vote the one that stands out is nissans 
planned expansion adding 1800 or so jobs said harley shaiken 
a labor relations professor at the university of california at san 
diego 
i think that expansion tends to diffuse some of the 
discontent people who have trouble with their job today can 
perhaps look forward to a promotion tomorrow with that kind of 
expansion shaiken said 
the company recently announced it would expand the capacity of 
the plant to 440000 vehicles a year from the current 265000 
making it the largest single auto assembly plant in the country 
the plant has 3200 employees including 2400 hourly workers who 
were eligible to vote 
david cole an industry expert at the university of michigan 
said he was surprised by the vote margin but noted that the plant 
opened only six years ago he said that isnt much time to build 
ill will 
theres still a bit of a honeymoon period these plants 
are comparatively new and theres still about a third of the labor 
force thats got problems with the system said cole director of 
the office for study of automotive transportation at the 
universitys transportation research institute 
worker safety and assembly line speeds had emerged as the two 
major issues in the uaws 18month campaign to organize the plant 
that began making light pickup trucks in 1983 the plant also makes 
sentra cars and a third as yet unannounced model will be added 
when the expansion is completed in 1991 
i guess the uaw didnt make its case inside the plant i 
imagine theyll keep trying but if an effort like this fails they 
wont have much luck at other japanese plants said david healey 
an analyst for drexel burnham lambert in new york 
wages at the nissan plant in smyrna range from 1110 to 1574 
an hour plus 145anhour guaranteed bonuses other bonuses are 
tied to quality and financial performance that is slightly lower 
than wage rates at uaw plants but the cost of living is low in 
central tennessee 
many workers at the 760 million plant 25 miles southeast of 
nashville have embraced the companys japanesestyle management in 
which they have a say in production and the shop floor is organized 
into teams whose members rotate tasks as often as every two hours 
worker redgie gentry said a union would have been an end to the 
teamwork 
it was like someone was trying to divide our family he said 
the uaw accused nissan of misrepresentation and intimidation to 
keep out the union including captive audience meetings and a 
barrage of antiunion videos 
in a statement uaw president owen bieber and other union 
officials said the election demonstrated that when a company was 
willing to use threats and misrepresentation to an unlimited 
extent that company can delay if not escape its day of reckoning 
jerry benefield president of nissan motor manufacturing usa 
denied the charges 
i think the results of this election are very strong support 
for the participatory management philosophy here at the company and 
were very happy were going to continue that benefield said 
nissan offers many benefits not seen in many manufacturer 
workplaces 
workers can lease nissan cars and trucks at a discount exercise 
at a fitness center and a recreational facility that includes 
tennis courts a golf driving range and swimming pools and put 
away taxfree dollars in a 401k plan in which the company matches 
employee contributions 
some analysts said the vote will keep the union out for some 
time but cornell university labor relations professor harry katz 
didnt think so 
the uaw says you can get the flexibility with the cooperation 
but theyve got to convince management to make that choice so i 
dont think theyre doomed katz said

house taxwriters are looking no farther than 
the halls outside their closed meeting room to find 5 million a 
year for a new tax break for a few corporations 
the target the cellular telephone favored by the lobbyists 
accounting firm representatives paralegals and even a few of the 
reporters who fill the halls any time the ways and means committee 
considers tax legislation 
the committee still adding pieces to a catchall tax bill that 
originated as a deficitreduction measure voted thursday to make 
it more difficult to claim a tax deduction for cellular phones 
present law permits a partial writeoff for depreciation of 
cellular phones used partially for business thus if a lawyer uses 
a phone 30 percent of the time for business 30 percent of the cost 
may be deducted 
committee aides said there is evidence some corporations and 
individuals abuse the deduction by claiming personal calls as a 
business expense 
under the committee amendment no deduction will be permitted 
unless more than 50 percent of the use is for business the user 
will have to keep records to substantiate the use the same rule 
already applies to cars and personal computers 
the restriction was approved to pay for an amendment by rep guy 
vander jagt rmich that would save money for a few us 
corporations whose income is earned entirely in a foreign country 
because the government is out of money the panel requires that any 
new tax cut be offset by a tax increase on somebody else 
vander jagts amendment was one of several added to a proposal 
by chairman dan rostenkowski dill that simplifies the corporate 
minimum tax that levy was created to ensure that profitmaking 
corporations pay some tax even if their deductions and credits are 
big enough to wipe out their regular liability 
in another voice vote thursday the committee added to the bill 
a permanent extension of the reaganera caribbean basin initiative 
which temporarily granted tarifffree treatment of certain imports 
from that region the proposal also extends the preferential 
treatment for the first time to apparel and other textile products 
the cbi changes would guarantee that caribbean countries would 
be able to export as much sugar to the united states as they are 
allowed to under existing quotas this year any reduction in total 
us imports of sugar would have to be borne by nations outside the 
caribbean 
meantime rostenkowski continued to delay a vote on reducing the 
tax on individual capital gains a majority 13 republicans and 
six democrats of the panel supports a temporary reduction in the 
tax which applies to stocks and other assets 
president bush has called for a cut to spur the economy and to 
raise revenues most democrats oppose the cut on grounds it would 
lose money after a year or two and because 80 percent of the tax 
cut would go to those with incomes above 100000 a year 
rostenkowski and house speaker thomas s foley have been 
appealing to fellow democrats to oppose a reduction but as a 
fallback the two leaders are weighing a counterproposal that would 
continue taxing capital gains at the same rates that apply to wages 
and other income but to index capital gains so that profits 
caused solely by inflation are not taxed

eastern airlines says concerns expressed by 
consumer groups that the carrier is using inexperienced pilots and 
scheduling phantom flights are silly 
jim ashlock a spokesman for the strikebound airline dismissed 
questions raised thursday by three national consumer groups and 
said the airline is following all federal aviation administration 
requirements in rebuilding its service 
public citizen the airline consumer action group and the 
national consumer league accused eastern of hiring too many 
inexperienced pilots scheduling phantom flights that never 
take off generating excessive complaints and failing to give 
refunds 
the bottom line is that the flying public has a right to know 
whats going on that they may be flying with an inexperienced 
crew that they are not getting much of a bargain flying eastern 
said linda golodner of the consumer league a private nonprofit 
membership organization that promotes consumer and worker welfare 
she endorsed a ninepage statement by public citizen which 
takes proconsumer stands on a wide variety of issues and the 
airline consumer group 
were providing information travelers have to take into 
account to decide for themselves whether to fly eastern said 
cornish hitchcock spokesman for public citizen 
he said a major concern was that some eastern flights would use 
both an inexperienced pilot and copilot in the same cockpit 
contrary to faa recommendations that at least one pilot have more 
than 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft to be flown 
these are the silliest things ive ever heard ashlock said 
eastern planned to increase from 225 to 390 daily flights aug 
1 but ashlock said from miami that the number would be held to 
about 350 until midaugust because of the inability to get enough 
pilots through training 
before the strike began march 4 the airline flew about 1000 
flights a day 
ashlock acknowledged that the airline has zeroed out some 
scheduled flights by stopping ticket sales but he said it was only 
done to protect consumer on flights where crews likely would not be 
available 
he said the high number of complaints recorded by the 
transportation department in a report earlier this month does not 
reflect current problems but stems from the immediate aftermath of 
the strike when machinists pilots and flight attendants walked off 
the job leading the airline to file for reorganization under 
bankruptcy laws 
the bankruptcy court has power over ticket refunds ashlock 
said adding that the airline is following all faa requirements in 
training and assigning pilots 
we wouldnt want to break any faa rules and we couldnt if we 
did want to ashlock said 
hitchcock at a public citizen news conference said passengers 
should be aware that a bankruptcy court decision earlier this month 
setting up a 5 million reimbursement fund for travel agents may be 
acting as an incentive for agents to sell eastern tickets 
the agreement he said requires that eastern increase the fund 
only if agents sell more than 36 million in eastern tickets each 
week 
from a passengers standpoint this agreement raises 
serious conflict of interest issues hitchcock said

sen howard metzenbaums recipe for better 
health has one major ingredient a heaping measure of accurate 
nutritional information 
for far too long we americans have been shopping in the 
dark the ohio democrat said thursday as he and other lawmakers 
joined together to support the proposed nutrition labeling and 
education act 
today were here to shine a little light on the food that 
lines our supermarket aisles 
the bill comes as food companies try to attract an increasingly 
healthconscious american public with products that are labeled 
lite or cholesterol free 
hearings on the proposed legislation will begin next week before 
the house subcommittee on health and the environment 
metzenbaum said the mandatory uniform labels required by the 
bill would eliminate what are at best confusing at worst 
downright deceptive labels voluntarily provided by many food 
manufacturers and processors 
about 55 percent of food includes some nutritional labeling 
this bill will in a sense give us a stomachimpact 
statement said rep jim cooper dtenn product labeling he 
said is a decade behind in giving consumers the kind of 
information they want 
the legislation has the support of 23 nutrition and health 
organizations including the american heart association center for 
science in the public interest american cancer society american 
dietetic association american college of physicians and public 
voice for food and health policy 
representatives from most of the groups appeared at a thursday 
news conference praising the bill for recognizing longstanding 
scientific research and educational efforts linking nutrition with 
deadly illnesses such as heart disease and cancer 
ellen haas of public voice for food and health policy a 
nutrition advocacy group said the legislation would refocus 
emphasis on food contents such as fat sodium and cholesterol and 
would give the consumer more understandable information 
the grocery manufacturers of america which represents 140 
national brand food manufacturers strongly supports efforts to 
comprehensively reform and standardize health and dietary 
information which appears on food labels said spokesman jeff 
nedelman 
but he said the bill had no provision to mandate national 
uniformity and would instead set specific requirements and put 
restrictions on the information that must be made available he 
also said it would not allow enough flexibility in labeling to 
account for future changes in scientific information 
karen brown a spokeswoman for the food marketing institute 
said her group had not examined the proposal but agreed that it was 
time to reexamine how nutritional information is provided 
the bill would 
make nutrition labeling mandatory on processed food sold in the 
united states 
require disclosure of certain essential pieces of information 
including the amount of fiber fat type of fat and amount of 
cholesterol 
use recommendations from the national academy of sciences to 
improve the format of labels and provide comparative context for 
the information 
provide clear and definite standards governing claims and 
statements involving such terms as lite and 
cholesterolfree 
metzenbaum criticized the food and drug administration for 
moving slowly on the issue 
sen john chafee rri echoed that concern in a written 
statement supporting the bill he said it had been 16 years since 
any fundamental change had been made in the way foods are labeled 
other cosponsors of the bill are democratic reps joe moakley of 
massachusetts and dan glickman of kansas

federal regulators and the manufacturer of dc10 
jets have rejected a call by an airline passengers group to ground 
the aircraft to check for structural problems following last weeks 
deadly plane crash in iowa 
the international airline passengers association said thursday 
it wants the federal aviation administration to order the planes 
out of use in the wake of the july 19 crash of a united airlines 
dc10 in sioux city iowa that killed 111 people said spokesman 
daniel smith 
citing the crash smith said it is evident that the aircrafts 
hydraulic systems necessary for flight control do not work and 
the systems need to be separate 
in a letter to faa chief james busey in washington iapa said it 
wants to first find out whats wrong with the aircraft and 
secondly get it fixed 
although iapa has not ruled out court action the group which 
claims 11000 members around the world said it hopes the plane 
will be grounded without having to resort to legal means 
jay leyden a faa spokesman in washington rejected the demand 
theres nothing thats come out of the sioux city accident 
indicating a basic design flaw that would warrant such an action 
leyden said 
also on thursday eight days after the iowa dc10 accident a 
korean air dc10 crashed short of a fogbound airport in tripoli 
libya killing at least 75 people but a spokesman for the south 
korean embassy there said no mechanical problem was reported before 
the crash 
mcdonnell douglas maker of the dc10 held a news conference at 
the long beach headquarters of douglas aircraft to denounce the 
iapas call to ground the aircraft 
i find it difficult to believe that a rational public a 
rational faa and even a rational congress will put very much 
credence in the statements of the iapa said dale warren a 
mcdonnell douglas vice president 
the real concern in my opinion is that we worry about the 
credibility of our aircraft to the traveling public warren said 
nevertheless warren said engineers are studying the crashes to 
determine whether a design modification is needed 
it would appear at this time that some action is 
appropriate warren said 
changes under consideration are additional backup controls ways 
of containing the damage from a jet engine explosion and methods of 
shielding the hydraulic system from such damage 
an initial investigation of the iowa crash indicates that an 
explosion in the planes tailmounted engine threw pieces of the 
turbine through the tail section rupturing at least two of the 
three hydraulic lines 
mcdonnell douglas technical experts have been sent to tripoli in 
hopes of assisting in the investigation of the korean air crash 
there warren said 
he said there are no indications to link the two recent crashes 
other than the make of the aircraft 
after a dc10 crash in chicago in 1979 the iapa won a federal 
court order grounding the dc10 fleet for more than a month while 
inspections were performed on some parts of the aircraft 
iapa then had asked the faa to separate the hydraulic systems of 
the aircraft 
in all smith said at least 17 or 38 percent of the 445 
dc10s built have been wrecked because of their problems a higher 
percentage of flaws than boeing 747s or lockheed l1011s

general electric co says the engine that 
apparently failed in a united airlines jet crash in iowa could not 
have been made with scrap parts from an air force plane 
dwight weber a spokesman at the ge plant in suburban cincinnati 
that built the dc10s three cf66 engines on thursday rejected a 
suggestion by rep john dingell dmich that ge may have used old 
parts in new production engines 
the parts dingell refers to we can categorically say were 
not used in the flight 232 engine weber said ge does not use 
recycled parts in new production engines however repaired parts 
are commonly used in overhauled engines 
dingell in a letter wednesday asked the federal aviation 
administration to investigate whether scrap parts were used in the 
tail engine of the united jet that crashed july 19 at sioux city 
iowa killing 111 people 
dingell chairs a house energy and commerce subcomittee that 
oversees such investigations 
weber said the fan section parts of the engine that failed on 
united flight 232 are not interchangeable with fan parts from the 
gemanufactured tf39 engine which powers the air forces c5a 
aircraft 
the tf39 parts wouldnt fit in the cf66 weber said 
ge said the cf66 engine produced from 1971 to 1981 for use 
specifically on dc10 series 10 craft such as the crashed united 
jet has established a reliable safety record during 17 million 
hours of commercial flight 
dingells letter asks a response from the faa by aug 4 dingell 
told reporters thursday in washington that he is not making 
allegations against manufacturers but wants a government 
assessment of the issue 
were simply following up on an inquiry we made to the faa 
several years ago in which we asked them to look into the problems 
of spare parts we have no information and are making no 
allegations about the behavior of any manufacturer dingell said 
national transportation safety board investigator jack young was 
at ges evendale plant thursday to examine ges manufacturing 
records for the no 2 engine of flight 232 federal investigators 
want to know why the engines fan section disintegrated about 45 
minutes into the flight from denver to chicago ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said the ntsb investigation was to continue today 
lopatkiewicz said wreckage of the engine is to be transported 
probably next week from the iowa crash site to ge evendale for a 
thorough teardown examination under ntsb supervision 
lopatkiewicz said the no 2 engines fan section was missing 
from the wreckage 
weber also said a different generation of ges cf6 series 
engines powered a korean air dc10 jet which crashed early thursday 
in heavy fog short of the airport in tripoli libya reportedly 
killing at least 75 of the 200 people on board the korean plane 
was powered by ges cf650 engines a higherthrust model which 
entered commercial service in october 1972 weber said

the nations two largest automakers in part 
blamed their own costly incentive programs for shaving profits in 
the second quarter 
general motors corp and ford motor co on thursday reported 
earnings slipped 39 percent and 156 percent respectively 
compared with the yearago period 
with all the incentives and the slower sales in the united 
states it was anticipated said analyst joshua harari of 
standard amp poors corp of new york 
as the quarter began both companies broadened their incentive 
programs featuring higher cash rebates and lower financing rates 
than previously offered 
the incentives continued through the quarter and could run at 
least through the end of the model year usually noted on sept 30 
chrysler corp which has rebates or lowinterest financing 
deals on nearly all of its cars and trucks is scheduled to 
announce its secondquarter results on monday 
gm earned 145 billion or 223 a share during the three 
months ended june 30 compared with 151 billion or 226 a share 
during the same time last year 
gms revenue including sales by the gm hughes electronics 
corp electronic data systems corp and general motors acceptance 
corp subsidiaries that reported earnings wednesday rose 13 
percent during the quarter to 336 billion from 3318 billion 
last year 
ford reported it earned 14 billion or 3 a share compared 
with 166 billion or 343 a share in the second quarter last 
year 
fords revenue rose to 259 billion during the quarter from 
2496 billion in the same period last year 
earnings from fords financial services group fell 199 percent 
to 173 million due to lower net interest margins the company 
said 
fords us profits softened due to expensive incentive programs 
and reduced profit margins said david mccammon the companys vice 
president for finance and treasurer 
he said incentives during the second quarter cost ford between 
600 and 700 a vehicle up sharply from the 200 to 300 average 
cost per vehicle during the previous quarter and the second quarter 
of last year 
gm spokesman terry sullivan said percar incentive costs for the 
quarter were unavailable however gm spent about 715 per car last 
year on incentives and said costs for the programs would be higher 
this year he said 
chrysler motors corp chairman bennett bidwell who oversees the 
companys vehiclemaking arm said the nations no 3 automaker 
spends about 700 per vehicle in incentives 
the buyer enticements are a double threat to automakers 
profits when sales slump profits generally do too to boost 
sales and profits companies take a gamble by offering incentives 
that are costly in the shortterm but designed to produce more 
buyers in the longterm 
but when interest wanes as recent sales declines apparently 
indicate returns on incentive costs may come later if at all and 
that cuts into shortterm profits 
gms domestic car and truck sales through the first half of this 
year were 77 percent behind last years pace and fords were down 
by 36 percent 
both ford and gm reported increased profits in their overseas 
operations 
they both had good first halves of the year in europe 
harari said this plays an important part in supporting their 
earnings it has for the last two years 
for the first six months of the year gm earned 301 billion 
or 460 a share up 157 percent from 26 billion or 382 a 
share during the first six months of last year revenue during the 
januaryjune period rose to 5963 billion from 5634 billion 
fords earnings for the first half of 1989 fell 76 percent to 
304 billion or 645 a share from 329 billion or 674 per 
share a year earlier revenue rose to 5176 billion from 4815 
billion 
gm and ford said they were continuing costcutting programs 
also on thursday chrysler announced a costcutting program aimed 
at carving 1 billion from its 26 billion budget during the next 
15 months cuts will come from all operations included about 2300 
salaried employees who will be taken off the payroll

a debate is heating up again over margins the 
amount of money investors must put up to buy stock index futures 
contracts and whether they cause sharp market fluctuations because 
theyre too low 
at issue is how much money or collateral investors must deposit 
with brokers when buying or selling futures contracts tied to the 
rise and fall of stock indexes such as the standard amp poors 
500stock index 
a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific 
amount of a commodity or financial instrument at a set price for 
future delivery the collateral used in buying futures contracts 
and other commodities and securities is known as a margin 
on thursday an sec report to a house subcommittee considering 
legislation to reform the securities industry expressed concern 
that low margins may lead to market volatility in the future 
in the stock market which is regulated by the sec investors 
must put up at least 50 percent of a securitys value but in 
commodity markets which buy and sell stock index futures the 
margin requirement is a fraction of that about 5 percent for 
speculators and 25 percent for hedgers 
critics say volatility like the wave of selling thta occurred 
during the 1987 market crash scares investors away from the 
market others maintain that sharp price movements are a problem 
only when prices are dropping 
the sec report said that during the oct 19 crash low stock 
index futures margin requirements contributed to sharp price 
movements 
aside from the direct impact on market volatility low stock 
index futures margin can contribute to disruptions for market 
systems and participants during periods of shortterm volatility 
said the report prepared by the secs division of market 
regulation 
but commodity exchange officials in chicago said the sec was 
comparing apples and oranges 
margins on futures and margins on securities are not 
comparable said andrew a yemma a spokesman for the chicago 
mercantile exchange where futures tied to the sampp 500 are traded 
margins on stocks are a downpayment of a purchase of an asset 
margins on futures are deposits on a binding contract to perform 
at the chicago board of trade which trades stock index futures 
based on the major market index of 20 blue chip industrial stocks 
spokesman mark prout noted that larger traders can post margins as 
low as 10 percent 
the sec long has sought to raise the levels of futures contracts 
margins last may sec chairman david ruder recommended lifting 
margins to 20 percent or 25 percent of contract value 
but the exchanges in chicago kansas city and new york that deal 
in stock index futures are regulated by the commodity futures 
trading commission which lets the exchanges set margin limits 
a cftc spokeswoman who did not want to be identified said 
ruder was the only member of a fourperson presidential panel 
appointed to investigate the 1987 crash that believed high margin 
levels would reduce volatility 
theres no proof of this she said adding that the cftc 
believes that higher margin levels will raise transaction costs 
and will have a negative effect on liquidity and efficiency 
the sec report came in response to a request from rep edward j 
markey dmass chairman of the house subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance 
the report also said there was a correlation between volatility 
and computerized program trading although it could not prove one 
caused the other 
program trading the rapid computerdriven buying and selling 
of baskets of stocks was considered a key factor in the crash

mccaw cellular communications inc 
officials say they have lined up 25 billion in financing to 
finance its 56 billion bid for lin broadcasting corp 
a statement issued by mccaw based in this seattle suburb said 
the investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc said it was 
confident the money could be raised either privately or publicly 
in todays capital markets 
the deal is a key element of our overall 56 billion 
financing plan said peter ls currie mccaw senior vice 
president for finance and we remain highly confident as well 
that we will complete arrangements for the balance of the financing 
on a timely basis 
meanwhile lin released an exchange of letters thursday between 
mccaw chairman craig o mccaw and lin indicating the two companies 
remained at odds on the takeover bid 
mccaw the nations largest cellular telephone company in terms 
of pops a measurement of market potential is offering 110 
for each lin share while lin management is seeking 12750 a share 
at 12750 a share the buyout would value the new yorkbased 
cellular telephone television broadcasting and publishing company 
at nearly 69 billion 
mccaw already owns 5 million of lins 539 million shares 
mccaw initially offered 120 a share which lin rejected as 
inadequate the offer was lowered to 110 after a court ruling that 
went against lin concerning cellular operations owned jointly by it 
and metromedia 
on july 13 a joint statement said a buyout for 12750 a share 
in cash and stock was under negotiation but mccaw withdrew from 
those talks last week and extended its 110ashare tender offer 
on tuesday lin chairman donald a pels said he would support a 
mccaw buyout offer of no less than 12750 per share if a 
definitive agreement were reached by monday 
mccaw replied in the letter that he was still willing to 
entertain a price above our current offer but the 
inflexibility of your requirements has made it impossible to 
reach a definitive agreement

anyone searching through sears roebuck and 
cos latest financial results for clues about the success of its 
new retail strategy should remember one thing giants usually dont 
move quickly 
its not something that were going to see in a quarter or two 
just because of the amount of change that has to occur says 
retail analyst linda r morris of pnc financial corp 
karen sach of standard amp poors corp offered a similar 
assessment after sears the nations biggest retailer and also a 
power in financial services released its secondquarter earnings 
figures last week 
its going to be awhile before we see any turnaround in the 
merchandising group says ms sach thats something thats 
maybe a year down the road i didnt expect anything fantastic this 
soon 
at first glance sears stats looked attractiveearnings grew 
214 percenton a 92 percent revenue gain earnings in the quarter 
ended june 30 rose to 3912 million or 111 a share from 3222 
million or 85 cents a share a year earlier revenue rose to 
1328 billion from 1216 billion 
but two special factors inflated the figures 
the 69 million earnings increase included a 549 million gain 
from the sale of the commercial division of the coldwell banker 
real estate group counted as a discontinued operation earnings 
solely from continuing operations declined to 3349 million from 
3383 million 
for the merchandise group which accounts for the bulk of the 
corporations business a change in the method of accounting for 
inventory added 219 million to earnings the groups earnings 
totaled 1616 million in the second quarter vs 1576 million in 
1988 
if not for the onetime gain from the change in accounting 
procedures the sears merchandise group would have had an earnings 
decline 
despite expectations for a slow revival in its core retailing 
operation securities analysts arent raising red flags of warning 
about holding sears stock 
this is partly because its financial services divisions such as 
the discover credit card allstate insurance and dean witter 
reynolds investment unit have been doing well and should continue 
to do so 
for another thing the retailing giant could end up clobbering 
the competition if its new everyday lowpricing policy and other 
new marketing tactics produce the desired benefits 
ms sach says it will take time to reeducate sears customers 
and persuade them that they dont have to wait for sales they can 
come into stores any day and pick up bargains 
sears hasnt abandoned special markdowns completely since the 
march introduction of everyday low prices it has run several 
this week only promotions and other campaigns advertising 
extralow prices on certain items 
these special promotions might confuse customers who may think 
theyd be better off delaying purchases at sears in hopes of lower 
prices to come some retail analysts say 
some of the changes at sears have hefty price tags that will 
probably impair earnings for awhile but they are intended 
eventually to yield significant savings and enhance profits 
there are shortterm negatives that hopefully will turn into 
longterm positives said ms morris citing severance pay to 
departing employees whose jobs were eliminated as part of sears 
restructuring and the cost of relocating the merchandise group out 
of downtown chicago to a nearby location 
many aspects of sears new strategy have yet to be put fully in 
place more namebrand merchandise is appearing gradually in sears 
stores an addition that sears and industry analysts expect will 
boost business for example 
sears and its rivals may all face a tough time if an economic 
downturn causes consumers to shut their pocketbooks lowto 
moderateincome consumers who typically shop at discounters may 
be the first to react in a recession 
it just seems to me that this group is usually the one with 
very little savings living pay check to pay check and theyre the 
ones who get concerned about the economy first says ms morris 
you really start to pull back and you dont take that weekly trip 
to sears or k mart to see what you need

a federal bankruptcy judge approved a 50cent 
hourly pay increase for 5000 union employees of financially 
troubled wheelingpittsburgh steel corp 
but judge warren bentz said thursday that he found the motion 
requesting the pay hike offensive because it referred to the 
companys recent profitability he noted that there are about 12 
billion in bankruptcy claims on which not a nickel has been 
paid 
union employees who havent had a wage hike in a decade make a 
minimum of 9 an hour 
bentz initially threatened to tie the wage increase to a 
twomonth deadline for the company and creditors to submit a final 
plan of bankruptcy reorganization the steelmaker filed for chapter 
11 protection from its creditors in 1985 
how soon can i get a plan finalized he asked company 
attorneys why cant you do this in two months 
a major issue in the reorganization is a new labor agreement 
with the united steelworkers to replace one that expires 10 days 
after the company emerges from bankruptcy court protection 
the union has insisted it could not negotiate a new contract 
until a longrunning dispute is resolved with the federal pension 
benefit guaranty corp 
but bentz said that issue which is before us district judge 
paul simmons could take years to solve 
youll have the same uncertainties a year from now two years 
from now he said you might as well get on with it 
paul whitehead an attorney for the union said the interim 
raise was requested after the usw learned the company was granting 
merit pay increases of about 5 percent to salaried employees

from boat loans to creditcard accounts it 
seems like almost any type of bank debt these days is fair game for 
repackaging by financial experts who then resell it at a markup to 
other investors 
the debt is securitized or restructured in the form of 
bonds and peddled in the credit markets in what has turned into a 
multibillion dollar business 
it works like this say a bank has a bunch of loans on its books 
that it wants to get rid of so it can meet net capital requirements 
and loan more money the bank creates a trust and sells these 
loans to the trust 
the trust then turns the debt into bonds for sale to investors 
when the monthly payments on the original loans come in some of 
the money is passed on to the trust which in turn gives some of it 
back to the bond investors as interest 
along the way the bank and the underwriter often a wall street 
investment house take a cut in the interest paid on the original 
loans so that the investor in the securitized bonds may see a 
yield of 9 percent or so while the bank may be receiving 19 percent 
on the loan payments 
to be fair not all the interest rate spread is profit for the 
bond issuers some must be used to buy letters of credit that 
insure the bondholders will be paid even if there are defaults by 
loanholders some represents reserves against such bad debt and 
some represents processing costs 
still its a pretty neat deal for everyone involved the bank 
gets unwanted loans off its books investment houses have a new 
profit generator and investors have a place to put their money 
that yields more than treasury bonds but is rated almost as safe 
no wonder the market for these assetbacked bonds has 
boomed though the market originated in mortgagebacked securities 
in the 1970s the first of the newwave nonmortgage issues came 
to market in march 1985 according to merrill lynch amp co since 
then more than 44 billion in such bonds has been issued merrill 
lynch said 
until the past few months all assetbacked bonds were aimed at 
institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension 
funds the minimum investment required was in the millions of 
dollars but with the introduction of two new credit cardbacked 
bonds small investors can now take part 
the first of these issues was introduced in may by citicorp the 
bonds are backed by payments on the big banks credit card accounts 
and sold in chunks priced at 1000 each 
these bonds have been dubbed plastic bonds from the nickname 
for credit cards they were priced to yield about 9 percent far 
less than the 198 percent citicorp charges in interest on the 
credit cards themselves but more than treasuries they are rated 
aaa by the credit rating agencies 
the citicorp bonds hold the potential for this interesting 
scenario some of the investors buying the bonds are most likely 
among the 600000 citicorp mastercard and visa card holders 
creating the debt in the first place so in effect these 
investors are getting back some of the interest they pay on their 
credit card accounts through the yield on the bonds 
the second assetbacked bond issue aimed at individual investors 
came out last month and is backed by sears roebuck and co credit 
cards both have been wellreceived said ira weiss who helps 
manage the marketing of these issues for merrill lynch 
sales have been gratifying he said the yields are more 
attractive than what they can find in alternative investments of 
the same quality in addition he said investors receive a 
monthly interest payment a convenience unavailable from other 
bonds 
merrill lynch which helped underwrite the sears and citicorp 
bonds plans to market more creditcard bond issues to small 
investors later this year weiss said 
he said creditcard issuers and other creditcreating 
institutions will most likely jump at the chance to exploit this 
new market for assetbacked securities 
they have enormous amounts of assets on their balance sheets 
that theyd like to securitize he said its in its infancy 
clifford griep a managing director at standard amp poors corp 
sees the same future for the institutional market 
the market is still assimilating the technology and i think 
were in a pretty rapid growth phase here he said 
sampp predicts the public market for assetbacked bonds will top 
20 billion this year

rapidly rising imports pushed japans current 
account surplus down in june for the fourth consecutive monthly 
decline from yearearlier levels the finance ministry reported 
friday 
the ministry said the surplus for the month was 412 billion 
down 33 percent from the 612 billion registered a year earlier 
the imbalance in the current account which includes merchandise 
trade and other financial flows was up from 339 billion in may 
it said 
the trade surplus followed the same pattern falling to 644 
billion from 739 billion a year earlier but rising from 506 
billion in may as measured when contracts were settled 
finance ministry officials said imports were sharply higher than 
a year earlier due to continuing strong domestic economic demand 
they said imports of manufactured goods were particularly brisk 
on the other hand exports of some products including steel and 
automobiles fell short of yearearlier levels the officials said 
they said political unrest in beijing in june which disrupted 
chinas economy may have had a bearing on the relatively sluggish 
export performance 
steel and auto industry associations have said the turmoil in 
beijing hurt japans shipments of steel and motor vehicles to china 
imports climbed 128 percent from the yearearlier level to 
158 billion dollars while declining 27 percent from may 
exports grew a modest 39 percent from a year earlier to 223 
billion while rising 44 percent from may 
after seasonal adjustment the current account surplus came to 
292 billion down from 336 billion the preceding month

westinghouse electric corp says a new 
configuration of electronic circuitry holds promise as an 
allinone radar system that will take up less space on stealth 
aircraft and offer advantages in other settings 
this is kind of a leapfrog this is the wave of the future 
said donald k alexander manager of antenna design and development 
at the westinghouse electronic systems group in baltimore 
on the heels of a 2 million defense grant westinghouse on 
thursday unveiled a project thats been in the works secretly for 
the last three years the company hopes to succeed in stacking 
wafers of microcircuits and connecting them into one system that 
would replace several bulkier and heavier radar systems 
the sixmonth grant is the first installment from the defense 
advanced research projects agency which is expected to contribute 
a total of 92 million over two years westinghouse had been 
developing the wafer radar with its own money and assistance from 
mcdonnelldouglas aircraft corp 
a single wafer radar system would be able to watch for aircraft 
or missiles follow them and map terrain and control weapons 
functions now performed by separate systems with separate antennas 
a combined radar system would have a special value in the 
stealth program because of the nature of the radardefeating planes 
the one thing you dont want to do with a stealthy airplane is 
cut holes in it for additional systems alexander said 
stealth technology relies in part on smooth uninterrupted 
surfaces of uniform material to slip undetected through the probing 
electronic beams of surveillance radar 
other applications for the new radar include lightweight space 
communications smart weapons control portable and mobile ground 
communications and submarine radar 
like todays most sophisticated radar the integrated wafer 
circuitry is made of gallium arsenide which conducts electricity 
much faster than silicon gallium arsenide circuits are also 
resistant to radiation 
the biggest drawback of gallium arsenide chips is that they are 
harder to make westinghouse said it has demonstrated manufacturing 
techniques that will help overcome the production problems 
the defense grant covers the design and fabrication of prototype 
wafer components the next steps would be to produce a useable size 
antenna and demonstrate it fullscale application might be six to 
10 years away alexander said

mai basic four inc announced it is backing off 
its 11 billion attempt to take over prime computer inc but is 
still vying for primes minicomputer business 
mai said in a statement it would allow its tender offer to 
expire at midnight thursday mai said it had concluded that it 
could not obtain extensions of its financing commitments 
because of the frequent changes which have occurred in primes 
estimates and projections 
however the announcement did not end the battle for prime jh 
whitney amp co which has agreed to buy prime for 12 billion has 
been unable to complete its offer because of two lawsuits and 
financing problems 
whitney announced today it was extending its offer until aug 4 
mai offered 1950 in cash for about 75 percent of primes 
shares and a package of bonds and preferred stock for the rest 
jh whitney the nations oldest venture capital firm has 
offered 2150 a share in case for about 50 million prime shares 
and would exchange notes for the rest 
spokesmen for prime and whitney said they had no comment on 
mais announcement 
prime stock rose 50 cents to 1625 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading thursday 
stephen k smith an analyst with painewebber inc in new york 
said the continued uncertainty over primes future was hurting the 
company but predicted jh whitney would still come out the victor 
just the fact that these things are dragging on so long are 
dragging them down said smith we still feel whitney will come 
through 
the jh whitney bid has been delayed by a suit brought by prime 
bondholder conarb partners seeking to extend the deadline for the 
offer 
us district court judge david edelstein denied conarbs 
request for a temporary restraining order on thursday jh whitney 
said in a statement 
theodore altman an attorney for conarb said news that whitney 
needed additional financing for a merger with prime sparked the 
suit we werent fighting for anything but more information he 
said 
conarb partners holds bonds that can be converted into prime 
stock 
prime faces a lawsuit from a miamibased company seeking to stop 
a merger with jh whitney according federal court documents 
united trust fund inc filed suit against prime july 21 over a 
lease agreement with primes wholly owned subsidiary 
computervision corp saying prime had agreed it would not enter 
any merger that would decrease its net worth below 250 million 
according to the suit filed in us district court in boston 
in an order issued wednesday us district judge joseph tauro 
said he would only rule on an injunction seven days before the 
proposed merger between prime and jh whitney 
two banks also have asked jh whitney to obtain additional 
financing before they will back the friendly buyout of prime 
prime based in natick has about 11000 employees it makes 
minicomputers and is the second to international business machines 
corp in the computeraided design and manufacturing systems field 
mai basic of tustin calif is about onequarter primes size

hired pilots resulted in a striking pilots arrest and a machinists 
leader being placed in handcuffs

melee in which eastern pickets claimed they were threatened with 
guns by people they believed to be strikebreaking pilots 
pilots union spokesman hank weber said 30 to 40 strikers were 
picketing early thursday outside the doral country club and hotel 
where some pilots hired by eastern during the strike are being 
housed when people in two cars waved revolvers at them

one pilot kicked in its door before it sped away he said picketers 
turned the cars license tag number over to police 
pilot john sorensen was charged with disorderly conduct and 
frank ortis vice president of machinists local 702 was handcuffed 
but released without arrest after talking with police 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the company was still 
gathering information

mediation board mediator not bankruptcy examiner david shapiro to 
oversee contract talks eastern on wednesday withdrew its request 
that the bankruptcy court terminate the pilots contract and 
suggested shapiro serve as mediator 
eastern may want that but we need a trained mediator weber

progress after talks last week under shapiros auspices eastern a 
unit of texas air corp filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization march 9 five days after the machinists struck when

widespread sales of digital audio tape dat 
recorders may begin next year under a new agreement between 
international record and electronic industry groups officials said 
friday 
dat machines can make highquality sound recordings using the 
same digital technology as compact disc cd players but their 
introduction has been slowed by opposition from record companies 
who feared they would encourage pirating and cut into cd and record 
sales 
in a pact announced this week record and audio industry groups 
agreed on a new worldwide standard for dats that clears the way for 
widespread marketing but limits the machines ability to make 
repeated copies of cds and other recorded material 
industry officials said it would take a minimum of eight to nine 
months before new dat recorders are introduced and marketing begins 
in countries such as the united states because of the time needed 
for design and government approval 
it will require new integrated circuits you will not see a 
machine coming out from my company this year said a sony corp 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
dat players currently are being marketed in japan and some parts 
of europe the more than 10 japanese electronics firms that produce 
most of the worlds dat equipment have refrained from actively 
selling the machines in the united states because of opposition 
from the us record industry 
dat players combine many of the technologies used to make 
videocassette recorders and compact disc players us electronics 
companies have largely abandoned the manufacture of both products 
and therefore are unlikely to make dats 
dat is not expected to become a serious threat to the thriving 
compact disk industry until the price of dat recorders and tapes 
comes down the least expensive dat models in japan currently cost 
about 800 while onehour tapes sell for considerably more than 
10 
both prices are expected to fall substantially as production 
increases due to economies of scale hata said 
kinji kawamoto general manager of panasonics audio and video 
research laboratory said the pact would have virtually no 
effect on dat production costs it will only involve a slight 
redesign of the semiconductor chips controlling logic functions 
he said 
included in fridays agreement were the recording industry 
association of america the international federation of the 
phonographic industry and japanese and european electronics makers

an investment group led by los angeles 
businessman alfred checchi says it has completed its 36 billion 
tender offer and appeared to have won control of nwa inc the 
parent of northwest airlines 
but checchis victory thursday was soon followed by a worsening 
of labor problems at the nations fourthlargest airline northwest 
and its pilots union announced that 28monthlong talks on a new 
contract had broken down 
the union said it would seek binding arbitration from the 
national mediation board 
checchis group wings holdings inc said it accepted for 
purchase all duly tendered shares of nwa common stock and that it 
now controlled 99 percent of the companys common shares 
as of may 31 nwa had 294 million shares outstanding the 
121pershare takeover offer expired at 5 pm edt wednesday 
we are delighted to have completed this acquisition checchi 
said in a statement released in new york now we can get on with 
the real job which is continuing to build northwest over the long 
term 
he said the new owners hoped to double the companys revenue 
over the next five years while improving service and assuring 
harmonious relations between management and employees 
mark daugherty an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc in new 
york was wary about nwas prospectsif youre looking at the 
future of the company id be very worried he said 
daugherty said checchis buyout plan which includes 700 
million in cash and 335 billion in financing is risky because 
the airline industry is capital intensive volatile and cyclical 
if i were a pilot or any other employee i would be very 
concerned that my company would have to support this debt burden 
he said 
checchi has said fears about debt in the deal are almost 
laughable 
the amount of debt in this proposal is not the least bit 
excessive he said last month 
the pilots union and another analyst say they also dont fear 
the debt 
i dont think the man is foolhardy said kevin murphy an 
analyst with morgan stanley amp co in new york it provides a lot 
of debt but who cares if its a private company 
murphy noted that checchi already has passed several checkpoints 
designed to make sure he can continue to provide the service 
safety and growth northwest has in the past 
but he also said northwests ticket prices may increase to pay 
for the debt 
steve arnold a spokesman for the 5000member air line pilots 
association local at northwest said the union became less 
concerned about the debt level after reviewing checchis plan 
earlier this year 
while his debt is a concern to us we feel he can accomplish 
what he says he can do arnold said 
northwests talks with the pilots recessed due to what was 
called a dispute over pay issues 
rich siakel a spokesman for the pilots said some progress had 
been made until thursday and today apparently everything went 
sour the pilots made a counterproposal on pay issues to which 
northwest would not respond he said 
alan muncaster northwests vice president for corporate 
communications said several key issues had been resolved 
pensions work rules and job security 
but some big dollars still separate the two sides on wages 
health insurance for retirees and a special payment fund for 
pilots he said 
the national mediation board must decide whether to grant the 
pilots request for arbitration if northwest rejected arbitration 
a 30day coolingoff period would begin after which the pilots 
would be free to strike and the company would be free to impose its 
latest offer 
although checchi has become northwests new owner a few more 
steps must be taken to make the change formal 
the merger of nwa with a subsidiary of wings must be consummated 
and wings needs an operating permit from the us transportation 
department which is conducting a financial fitness review of the 
new owners

consumer spending was unchanged in june 
turning in its weakest performance in nine months while personal 
incomes rose a modest 03 percent the government reported today 
both figures provided further evidence of an economy that is 
beginning to slow significantly consumer spending because it 
represents twothirds of total economic activity is closely 
followed by economists for warning signs of a possible recession 
many economists are predicting however that consumer spending 
will rebound somewhat in the second half of the year because of a 
belief that recent moves by the federal reserve to lower interest 
rates will spur home sales and purchases of bigticket items such 
as autos 
consumer spending stayed at an annual level of 344 trillion in 
june after a modest increase of 02 percent in may the june 
performance was the weakest since spending actually fell by 01 
percent in september 1988 
these figures are calculated in current dollars if inflation is 
factored out spending was even weaker edging down 01 percent in 
june after falling 02 percent in may it was the first 
backtoback declines in inflationadjusted spending since 
september and october of 1987 
the rise in personal incomes of 03 percent followed an even 
smaller 02 percent increase in may it left incomes at an annual 
level of 441 trillion in june 
the key category of wages and salaries rose by 05 percent in 
june after showing essentially no change in may 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods items expected 
to last three or more years fell by 17 billion following a 96 
billion decrease in may much of this weakness reflected a slump in 
car sales 
purchases of nondurable goods edged up 400 million following a 
much bigger 49 billion rise in may an advance propelled in part 
by higher costs for gasoline and food 
purchases of services were up 25 billion following a giant 
127 billion jump in may the may increase had been attributed to 
a sharp rise in electricity purchases for air conditioning because 
of hot weather 
disposable or aftertax incomes climbed by 06 percent in june 
following a 08 percent may advance 
the personal savings rate savings as a percent of disposable 
income climbed to 59 percent in june the highest level since 
march when it was at 62 percent in april the savings rate took a 
nosedive to 49 percent as americans had to write checks to pay off 
their federal tax bill

winstonsalem nc ap after a long engagement between two 
original puddlejumpers one of the biggest airline marriages will 
take place aug 5 when piedmont airlines assumes the name of 
suitor usair group inc 
the union will create an airline that employs more than 48000 
people operating a fleet of 426 jets in 36 states two canadian 
provinces the bahamas and britain 
figures compiled by the air transport association in washington 
show the combined operations would rank usair as the seventh 
largest in terms of capacity the two airlines flew more than 59 
million passengers last year 
the courtship between usair and piedmont was brief and 
expensive and came at a time when the airline market was becoming 
carnivorous usair bought piedmont for 159 billion cash 
piedmont folks expected people would have to spend a heck of a 
lot of money said dan brock vice president of marketing 
services for usair and former senior vice president of marketing 
for piedmont 
there was a strong feeling of self worth he said we knew 
we were good and we wanted to be good i dont think it surprised 
anybody that we went for such a big price 
the usairpiedmont merger reflected a broad move throughout the 
deregulated airline industry to gain strength through size delta 
airlines bought western airlines texas air acquired people express 
and eastern northwest airlines bought republic airlines and trans 
world airlines bought ozark airlines 
twa also had wanted to buy usair making the piedmont purchase 
more important to usairs struggle to retain its identity 
piedmont employees are expected to miss their own identity 
established by the company 41 years ago when it began flying out of 
winstonsalem with small noisy propplanes but brock said piedmont 
isnt moving into hostile territory 
it is a marriage to a partner who is so similar to us brock 
said we have had to struggle so have they we began with a role 
of flying from small cities to big cities and usair was much the 
same we were lucky to be acquired by someone so much like us 
employees felt a sense of loss from the sense that piedmont 
was more than just a company he said the company was and in 
a sense still is a family 
the employees have had 2 years to adjust to the idea of merging 
with usair which is headquartered near washington 
company officials didnt want to rush into the merger 
brock said they wanted to plan it out get the issues behind us 
and know where we were going 
at a hangar at the smithreynolds airport in winstonsalem 
workers who wore piedmont patches toiled in the weeks before the 
merger to remove the piedmont name from jets and replace it with 
the red and blue usair logo 
by aug 5 piedmonts logo will be history 
in 1978 when deregulation of the airline industry began the 
logo represented one of only a few airlines serving the small 
southeastern towns that other carriers decided to skip piedmonts 
main competition was usair 
rather than leave these small towns both airlines chose to 
branch out and fly elsewhere as well as deregulation allowed them 
to do 
our job had been to feed these people to other airlines in 
major cities brock said with deregulation we could start 
trying to feed ourselves 
merger talks began as early as 1986 when piedmont chairman 
william howard held the first of several discussions with usair 
chairman edward colodny later the bids began coming 
norfolksouthern corp in february 1987 offered 149 billion or 
65 a share for piedmont the norfolk vabased transportation 
company already owned 195 percent of piedmonts stock 
usair offered 71 a share with half the 23 million outstanding 
common shares to be purchased in cash and the rest exchanged for 
usair stock 
piedmont wanted cash usair wanted piedmont so usair came back 
with an allcash agreement of 69 a share piedmont accepted the 
deal in march 1987 the us transportation departmer approved it a 
halfyear later and the planning for a smooth merger has been 
under way since 
piedmont was founded by thomas h davis who bought the 
controlling interest in a flying service and renamed it two 
twinengine dc3s were purchased and another was leased and the 
first piedmont flight departed at 705 am on feb 28 1948 
davis 29 along with company officers and one paying passenger 
bill turner a shell oil employee were on the flight from 
wilmington nc to cincinnati with five stops in between the 
entire trip took about 5 hours 
piedmonts schedule in the early years shows why it acquired the 
puddlejumper image even though the carrier began flying to los 
angeles and london in the mid1980s 
in the first year of business piedmont stopped in places like 
bluefield wva goldsboro nc and lynchburg va passengers 
could fly one way from winstonsalem to roanoke va for 1385 
the most expensive flight went between morehead city nc and 
chicago and cost 5225 
the final piedmont flight will leave dayton ohio on the night 
of aug 4 and will arrive at south bend ind no special ceremony 
is planned 
but after aug 5 at least one piedmont policy will be continued 
a full can of cocacola will be part of the inflight services 
thats one of the things many people were quite concerned 
about brock said

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
lower in early trading today on the chicago board of trade 
reflecting forecasts for scattered showers this weekend in the 
midwest 
further selling stemmed from disappointment that thursdays 
modest rally in the corn and soybean markets was not stronger 
analysts said traders who bought following mondays steep decline 
had been hoping for a much bigger rebound 
predictions for isolated showers in the corn belt promise 
further improvement in the corn and soybean crops which have 
benefited from nearperfect growing conditions in the last two 
weeks 
the sentiment is pretty negative said joel karlin research

a federal bankruptcy judge today 
ordered a trustee be appointed to identify assets of convicted bank 
swindler marvin warner that could be sold to pay off creditors who 
claim they are owed a total of 45 billion 
refusing to grant warners request for more time to organize his 
affairs us bankruptcy judge george l proctor set a hearing aug 
25 on motions in the case 
daniel bakst a west palm beach attorney was appointed trustee 
by the us trustees office to examine warners holdings and 
lawsuits against him before deciding what to do with his assets 
warner withdrew his latest plan to emerge from protection from 
his creditors thursday after all but one of the unsecured creditors 
rejected it he asked today for another 30 days to develop a new 
plan but proctor moved the case from chapter 11 reorganization to 
chapter 7 liquidation instead 
among the secured creditors is home state savings bank of 
cincinnati which is owed more than 275 million according to 
court records warner was president of the bank prior to its 
collapse in 1985 
american savings amp loan association of miami where warner 
served as a director also is listed among the unsecured creditors 
it is suing warner for breach of fiduciary duty and claims to be 
owed 316 million 
warner who now lives in ocala claims his estate is worth 2 
million to 3 million although creditors attorneys hope to 
include another 30 million to 40 million that creditors allege 
warner fraudulently transferred to members of his family 
according to documents filed by attorneys representing warners 
creditors he transferred 500000 in diamonds and 36 million in 
cash to his wife 
he also transferred 168 acres at his ocala horse ranch to his 
son and 42 million worth of thoroughbred horses to fred m cone

warner filed for reorganization under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code in october 1987 he listed 45 billion in debts 
and later claimed 20 million in assets although creditors say the 
amount is higher 
his filing followed the collapse of home state in march 1984 
which lost 144 million in investments arranged by warner with esm 
securities inc a security trading company in fort lauderdale fla

lawyers representing commodities traders have 
been asked to meet today with top us justice department officials 
before indictments are sought charging traders with cheating 
customers published reports say 
the chicago tribune said up to 50 traders could be hit with 
charges that they engaged in illegal practices at the chicago board 
of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange unidentified sources 
quoted by the wall street journal said the number of traders ranged 
from 10 to more than 20 
the charges would be the first from a twoyear investigation of 
the nations largest futures exchanges in which fbi agents 
infiltrated the trading floors to gather evidence on suspected 
corrupt practices 
indictments could come as early as next week unidentified 
sources told both papers 
their number and timing could depend on the outcome of the 
closeddoor meeting where prosecutors will begin unfolding their 
case defense lawyers are expected to try to convince them not to 
seek charges against clients under the federal racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations act known as rico 
under rico convicted traders could lose their exchange seats 
and any assets judged to have been acquired through illegal actions 
federal prosecutors typically call in individual defense lawyers 
on the eve of major indictments for oneonone negotiations to seek 
cooperation in exchange for reduced charges 
but such a large meeting is unusual the tribune said noting 
that at least a dozen defense attorneys have been invited and the 
justice department has flown in its top rico expert 
the attorneys invited to meet with prosecutors represent clients 
who were told two weeks ago that they had 14 days to decide to 
cooperate with the government or face a racketeering charge the 
newspaper said 
the journal noted that the justice department could name the 
futures trading pits as racketeering enterprises an unlikely 
and unprecedented step 
not only would such action damage the image of the exchanges 
the paper said it would allow traders to be indicted and tried 
together even if they did not trade with each other

the exxon corp promised today to pursue the 
cleanup of oilcontaminated beaches in alaska into 1990 if directed 
by the us coast guard saying it would go along with any 
reasonable request 
wd stevens president of exxon co usa told a house 
subcommittee the oil company stands behind earlier pledges to 
return to the contaminated shoreline next spring to reinspect the 
area to assure the job has been properly done and if not to put 
it right 
stevens said we intend to more than achieve cleanup 
objectives by midseptember and the company intends to go ahead 
with plans to demobilize most of its operation then for the winter 
coast guard vice adm clyde lusk said the contaminated areas 
would be surveyed in the spring and if additional work needs to be 
conducted exxon would be told to resume cleanup efforts but lusk 
suggested if exxon disagrees the governments only option is to 
federalize the effort and assume resposibility 
lusk said he had no doubt that during the spring survey 
there will be disagreeements on what should be done 
when pressed by subcommittee chairman george miller dcalif 
on what exxon would do if the coast guard demanded additional 
cleanup actions stevens stopped short of committing the company to 
complying with any coast guard directive 
we will follow through on any reasonable request that is 
made said the exxon executive he said he could not make an 
unequivocal commitment and told the hearing he would be naive 
to do that in light of expected disagrements within the 
scientific community on what should constitute a clean horeline 
concern about exxons cleanup plans arose this week after 
disclosure of an internal company memorandum that implied exxon 
will not commit itself to further cleanup efforts next spring 
the memo said current activity to clean oil from an estimated 
700 miles of shoreline along southern alaska resulting from the 
exxon valdez spill will stop sept 15 because of oncoming cold 
weather 
stevens said the wording of the memo was unfortunate and 
under questioning from miller said it was not meant to suggest 
exxon was pulling out of the cleanup effort after september 
miller said the focus of the hearing before the house interior 
subcommittee on water power and offshore energy resources was 
amined at determining exxons future cleanup plans and what actions 
the us coast guard intends to take should exxon not pursue a 
cleanup 
in separate testimony dennis kelso alaskas commissioner of 
environmental conservation criticized exxons decision to pull its 
heavy equipment back to anchorage for the winter saying there 
would be no way to launch emergency response efforts should new oil 
slicks threaten key fishing areas 
anchorage by road is about six hours from valdez across two 
mountain ranges said kelso 
the coast guard has overall federal authority over the cleanup 
effort and subcommittee members are looking for an assurance that 
it will force exxon to pursue the cleanup into 1990 if necessary 
most environmentalists believe the cleanup will be far from 
completed by midseptember although exxon officials have said they 
continue to expect to stabilize the contaminated areas by that 
time 
exxon said earlier this week it expects the cost of the cleanup 
from the march 24 tanker spill in prince william sound to soar to 
as much as 125 billion making it likely the most expensive 
industrial accident in us history that figure does not include 
possible compensatory or punitive damage claims 
the cleanup of the many miles of shoreline has become much more 
difficult than many had anticipated as areas of beaches have been 
partially swept of oil by streams of highpressure heated water 
only to become soiled by oil days later 
disclosure of the july 19 memo prompted a storm of criticism 
alaska gov steve cowper reminded reporters that exxon had promised 
to stay until the cleanup job was done its not enough to 
declare victory and go home the governor said

an era came to an end for spains 
158yearold stock market friday as investors and market operators 
traded for the last time under old rules to be swept away over the 
weekend in spains socalled big bang market reform 
a law set to take effect saturday introduces the most sweeping 
changes in markets in madrid barcelona bilbao and valencia since 
the founding of the first bourse in the spanish capital in 1831 
the privatization of the exchanges is expected to introduce 
greater competition in the markets which could mean that many of 
the new privatelyowned brokerage firms created by the big bang 
wont last long 
monday will be the first day of trading under the new system 
which spanish national radio termed an authentic revolution in 
the spanish financial system 
on friday civil servant stockbrokers enjoyed their last day of 
monopoly over trading rights the new law forced them to establish 
or join new private brokerages or brokerdealer companies or 
abandon trading altogether and act as public notaries 
market operators and regulators marked the final day under the 
old rules at a ceremony in the madrid stock exchange building 
following the morning trading session 
javier ramos gascon head of the old madrid stateentity 
exchange symbolically turned over power to 36yearold pedro 
guerrerro who was elected last week to preside over the new 
private exchange it is now owned and managed by new member 
brokerages and dealer firms 
national securities commission president luis carlos croissier 
acknowledged that survival in the new tough market is going to be 
difficult for some of the more than 50 new member brokerages or 
dealerbroker firms 
many analysts have predicted that from 20 to 30 of the new firms 
wont be around within two years because of a greater competition 
spurred by the reform 
there are too many new firms ramos gascon told reporters 
im afraid a good number of them will not last 
the government set up the securities comission nine months ago 
to implement the june 1988 market reform law the commission is the 
chief markets supervisory body and watchdog agency 
a key part of the reform law established the computer automated 
trading system or cats last april so far 23 stock issues 
accounting for 22 percent of trading volume have gone onto the 
system 
croissier predicted that by the end of the year more than 50 
percent of the total trading volume in spain would take place on 
the cats system which was pioneered by the toronto stock exchange 
on friday as in recent weeks trading volume remained low on 
the four stock exchanges partly because of investor concerns about 
the market reform changeover process and because of recent 
government moves to restrict credit and slow down a booming 
economy analysts said 
trading volume friday on the madrid stock exchange which 
accounts for nearly 70 percent of trading in spain totaled 33 
million shares or the equivalent of 623 million 
last april when the madrid market was surging trading volume 
moved between 56 million shares a day and 855 million to 1025 
million a day said madrid stock exchange spokesman jaime sanz 
the madrid general index friday rose a slight 143 points to 
30223 
the barcelona exchange general index dipped 026 points to 
10580 and the bilbao exchange general index climbed 356 points to 
41849 the valencia exchange general index rose 150 points to 
24332

in times like these when stock market 
speculators run up numbers as fast as the scores on pinball 
machines talk of 10 percent annual returns gets little attention 
this is a market in which takeover talk can jump a stock 25 
percent in a day and when on some days scores of stocks on the new 
york stock exchange may rise or fall by 5 percent without any 
rumors at all 
it is a fast market a market of big changes and high 
expectations and 10 percent a year seems trivial in comparison 
but it isnt over time it can produce wonders like turning 1000 
into 8000 in less than 25 years 
a review of market statistics shows in fact that 10 percent a 
year is the average return for the period 19261988 that is the 
annual rate for the standard amp poors 500stock index which 
includes good stocks and poor 
by taking the time spending the effort studying the market and 
making shrewd selections many investors have done much better and 
unless market logic has been overturned the future is likely to be 
as good 
using the law of 72 in which the annual rate of return is 
divided into 72 to obtain the number of years it will take for a 
sum to double a 1000 investment at 10 percent might be worth 
4000 in about 15 years 
not good enough then assume you are highly talented select 
wisely and benefit from a surging economy and thus obtain a 15 
percent return by the time those 15 years have elapsed your 1000 
would have grown to 8000 
investment history shows that relatively few investment advisers 
could top that record no matter how convincing their literature 
their graphics their publicity their claims or their 
selfacknowledged brilliance 
the 10 percent return of the sampp 500 in the 19261988 period was 
made up of an annual 46 percent dividend income and 49 percent 
earnings growth in addition the priceearnings ratio rose by an 
average of 05 percent 
these are averages derived from good years and bad including 
an entire decade of the deepest economic depression ever in some 
periods of years the return was double that 10 percent for the 
entire decade of the 1950s it was 194 percent 
nobody can say what the future will bring everyone has heard 
the caveat that past performance is not necessarily an indication 
of the future but when those words are used the past 
performance usually is but a few years 
in contrast the 10 percent expectation is based on a 62year 
average as compiled by wright investors service 
true there are some offsets about which little can be done 
taxes for example can cut the return from dividends because 
they are taxed each year and capital gains taxes apply when the 
investment is redeemed in the latter case however the investor 
benefits from the tax deferment 
inflation also cuts into returns it took away 31 percent a 
year in the 62year period still the equity premium over 
riskless investing in treasury bills came to 65 percent a 
year equities clearly were the way to go 
time isnt mentioned much by investment advisors in these days 
of instant results and quick dollars but time and compounding are 
factors that eventually produce the amazing results sought by many 
investors

democrats and republicans are heading for a 
showdown on the senate floor over a compromise landmark savings and 
loan bailout bill that would balloon the federal budget deficit 
a housesenate conference committee finishing its work with two 
marathon sessions lasting late into the evening decided thursday 
night to reject bushs complex plan to exclude 50 billion in 
rescue spending from the deficit 
bush asked at a news conference today about the sampl 
legislation said every day the sampl crisis remains unresolved 
its costing americans some estimates have been 10 million to 
30 million dollars a day 
asked if he could foresee any need to veto sampl legislation bush 
said it wont come to vetoing the sampl because we have 40plus 
votes in the senate that staying firm will see our proposal 
prevail the house as you know has disagreed with us but im 
confident that we will do all right on that one 
the agreement sends the legislation to the full house and senate 
for votes next week however the bush administration has raised 
objections and senators warned that republicans could block the 
plan in the senate 
nearly six months ago bush asked congress for emergency action 
to close or rescue hundreds of failed but stilloperating savings 
institutions 
under the compromise the governments largestever bailout 
would involve spending 166 billion including interest over the 
next 10 years the vast majority of it from taxpayers 
the bill includes a number of provisions to prevent a recurrence 
of what analysts call the worst financial crisis since the 
depression 
it requires sampl owners to risk more of their own capital to 
absorb losses before government deposit insurance kicks in sampls 
would have to devote more of their assets to financing housing and 
disclose how well they serve minorities and the poor they also 
would be prevented from using deposits to invest in highyield 
highrisk junk bonds 
the bill would enact the most sweeping restructuring of the 
regulatory bureaucracy since the 1930s it would dismantle the sampl 
agency the federal home loan bank board dividing its duties 
between an office in the treasury department and the federal 
deposit insurance corp now solely a bank regulator 
the conferees decided to defy bush on his funding proposal 
the administration argued that the democratic plan which 
inflates the budget deficit but exempts it from triggering 
automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman law will inspire a 
congressional spending spree on other programs 
democrats however say their plan allows the government to 
borrow the needed sampl money at a lower cost and is a more honest 
way to account for the spending 
the fivemember senate delegation had been split 32 in favor of 
the bush plan with sen alan cranston dcalif joining the two 
republicans on the panel 
but after 5 hours of debate and the house rejection of a 
senate compromise offer cranston shifted his position and joined 
sens donald w riegle jr dmich and paul sarbanes dmd in 
accepting the house plan 
sen john heinz rpa chided his fellow conferees for 
effectively postponing the difficult question 
it will result i fear in a stalemate not in this 
conference but on the senate floor he said 
sen phil gramm of texas an ardent opponent of the house 
funding plan says he has the support of 40 other republicans 
enough to block the compromise package under that chambers rules 
and even if the full senate goes along with the house bushs 
advisers have threatened to recommend a veto 
white house budget director richard darman told reporters 
thursday that he favors a veto joining treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady who has previously threatened to push for one 
brady however stopped short of such a threat in commenting on 
the agreement which he called an excellent product 
but he added the administrations position on financing is 
perfectly clear and remains unchanged we continue to actively 
oppose the house financing plan which requires a grammrudman 
waiver 
riegle noted that sampl losses are mounting at a rate of 20 
million a day and warned against holding up the badly needed bill 
until after congress returns from its august vacation 
house democrats gave in to cranstons plea to let the top 
federal sampl regulator m danny wall stay in his job without 
senate reconfirmation 
at confirmation hearings wall would be sure to face questions 
about his role in delaying regulatory action against lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif which has since 
failed and likely will require millions of dollars in government 
aid 
such questions would be uncomfortable for cranston and riegle 
because they accepted campaign contributions from lincolns owner 
charles keating and later intervened with regulators on lincolns 
behalf riegle has since returned keatings contribution but 
cranston has not

televised home shopping once heralded as a 
revolutionary leap that would turn millions of living rooms into 
shopping malls has lurched through a painful childhood because 
many potential customers arent buying 
sales of items ranging from zirconia jewelry to fancy electronic 
hardware have failed to meet the projections of analysts who had 
predicted remarkable growth in a business thats less than a decade 
old 
dozens of shopping networks begun with high ambitions have 
closed or shifted focus some aspiring networks are finding it 
difficult to persuade cable television system operators to make 
room for them 
nonetheless many analysts say home shoppings prospects remain 
promising because they expect operators to put aside territorial 
battles and concentrate on marketing themselves to prospective 
buyers those cable tv viewers who either arent watching or dont 
like whats for sale 
home shopping channels have a place in the future said 
larry gerbrandt who follows the business for the media research 
firm paul kagan associates inc of carmel calif we have just 
seen the tip of the iceberg of what they can do 
recently two of the three biggest home shopping network owners 
cvn companies inc and qvc network inc proposed to join forces in 
a move that would reduce home shopping network incs commanding 
lead 
minneapolisbased cvn which operates cable value network the 
fashion channel and americas shopping channel with more than 23 
million subscribers would be acquired for about 400 million in 
cash and stock by qvc the west chester pabased operator of the 
14 million subscriber qvc network 
home shopping says its three services are carried on cable and 
broadcast stations that can be seen by more than 60 million 
households 
the only other national home shopping service of significant 
size is the jc penney television shopping channel formerly known 
as shop television network it is available on cable systems with 
53 milion subscribers 
the management consulting and accounting firm touche ross amp co 
had estimated in 1986 that all home shopping programs would have a 
combined total of more than 5 billion in annual sales by 1990 
douglas hosking a top executive in electronic retail consulting 
at the san franciscobased firm concedes the projection was too 
optimistic and expects industrywide revenues will reach 3 billion 
to 5 billion in five years 
paul kagan associates estimates industry revenues totaled 14 
billion in 1988 and projects growth to 275 billion by 1993 
critics say they are not surprised that home shopping has failed 
to meet expectations they say the publics appetite for closeout 
merchandise and gadgets is bound to fade further 
but gerbrandt notes that home shopping channels are available to 
more than 60 percent of the nations television households 
william block vice president of research at the brokerage 
newhard cook amp co said surveys have shown more than half of all 
cable subscribers arent even of home shopping an untapped 
opportunity 
gerbrandt said the typical home shopping channel customer is 
over 35 years old with a college education and household income 
exceeding 35000 
thats more upscale than some people may have thought but 
then again nobody ever admits going into a k mart he said 
home shopping network was the industrys first big star when it 
went national in mid1985 with the shopping service that it had 
been running for three years on a local cable tv system in 
floridas tampa bay area 
it put hosts on the air who tried to create a bargainbasement 
atmosphere as they described eight to 12 products an hour often 
with a monitor counting down the number of items left or the number 
of seconds remaining until the sale would end they tooted horns 
and chatted with callers who only had to make a purchase to be 
admitted as a member of the club 
its approach was to offer a range of products a vcr may follow 
a gold necklace for instance to catch the impulse buyer 
our entertaining format where you dont know what is coming 
next keeps the viewer tuned in said spokeswoman kathy jurado 
but qvc network the letters stand for quality value and 
convenience took a different approach after it aired in november 
1986 about six months after cvn debuted 
qvc segments its programming by spending an hour at a time on 
one product category and promoting the presentations in advance 
qvc may spend an hour on telephones for instance discussing 
the features and pricing of each model qvc executive vice 
president bruce sellers said the approach allows people to shop as 
they would at a mall and gets fewer complaints than catalog 
retailers 
while hsn qvc and cvn built an audience gerbrandt said three 
dozen or more home shopping channels came and went over the past 
three years 
among the casualties were shoppers casino collectible 
showcase caravan of values and crazy eddies world of home 
entertainment 
hosking said one reason why so many failed was the relatively 
small startup cost 
it didnt take a lot of capital to get into the business but 
it takes a lot to be successful he said 
another problem was that many cable systems reached their 
capacity and decided they had no room for more than two shopping 
channels that was especially true when networks such as qvc signed 
longterm agreements with cable operators and offered them equity 
stakes in the service 
home shopping has failed to meet the ambitious sales goals its 
top executives have set and is embroiled in a civil trial in 
florida with gte corp over telephone problems that hsn said cost 
it millions of dollars in lost business gte has denied 
responsibility 
financial news network joined the ranks of shopping service 
dropouts in may when its discontinued its 2yearold fnn telshop 
service 
telshop had been running overnight and on weekends on the same 
channel as the financial news network 
we didnt lose our enthusiasm for the home shopping business 
but felt a need to go 24 hours a day with business information

american express co said friday it had apologized 
to international banker edmond safra for what it called an 
unauthorized and shameful effort to encourage false media reports 
that safras banks had been involved in money laundering 
american express also agreed to pay 4 million to charity as 
part of its unusual apology 
in letters released by the two sides american express chairman 
james d robinson iii said people acting on behalf of american 
express began an unauthorized and shameful effort to use the media 
to malign safra and republic national bank of new york in which 
safra holds a 33 percent stake 
robinson said he regarded the reports as untrue and 
defamatory 
while i believe in vigorous competition there is no room in 
our organization for actions which could cause unjustified harm to 
a competitor robinson said 
the letters were dated monday 
robinson also said in his letter that american express the 
giant us financial services company would make payments to four 
charities at safras request in an attempt to open a new 
chapter with safra and his banks the charities were the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith united way of america 
hopital cantonal de geneve and the international red cross 
luc giacobino a republic bank spokesman in geneva said news 
reports had alleged that safras banks were involved in laundering 
money 
safra and his associates launched an investigation lasting 
several months after noticing that articles containing the same 
information appeared in news media throughout the world including 
latin america and europe 
the investigation eventually led to american express but the 
republic spokesman refused to discuss the nature of the links 
between the news reports and company 
american express refused to discuss the matter stating only 
that it is an internal matter and that appropriate steps are 
being taken 
safra has filed at least two lawsuits accusing newspapers of 
publishing defamatory material 
a hearing on a suit against lhebbo a lausanne switzerland 
weekly newspaper is scheduled for next month in geneva the second 
suit involves minute a french newspaper 
in his reply to robinsons letter safra said he was grateful 
that robinson had agreed to take appropriate action to prevent 
further attacks 
i believe you had no personal involvement in or knowledge of 
the false rumors and innuendos about me and republic national bank 
of new york safra wrote 
safra a member of a lebanese banking family who now lives in 
geneva has made a career of providing banking services to the very 
rich his most recent venture was to form safra republic holdings 
sa last year from the european private banking operations of 
republic bank 
american express and safra became partners in private banking 
briefly after safra sold his trade development bank holdings sa to 
the us financial services conglomerate in 1983 for 520 million 
safra quit two years later following a falling out with american 
express top management

the house voted friday to delay for one year a 
businessopposed tax rule that would encourage companies to expand 
the number of employees covered by health insurance 
the provision is included in a spending bill the house approved 
37626 and sent to the senate proponents hope that eventually 
enough pressure will build to convince congress to repeal the 
socalled section 89 entirely 
the house ways and means committee and the senate have already 
approved legislation that would revamp the regulations and delay 
them until jan 1 but would not rescind them 
section 89 enacted in 1986 requires employers to demonstrate 
that their health plans do not favor higherpaid workers 
some business groups have lobbied congress to drop the rule 
claiming that it is so complicated timeconsuming and expensive 
that it ends up having an effect that is the opposite of what was 
intended 
many of them employers may cancel their health insurance 
plans for employees rather than go through all the red tape of 
section 89 said rep louise slaughter dny 
employers in my district are hopping mad said rep silvio 
conte rmass 
the rule was to take effect last jan 1 but became so 
controversial that the treasury department delayed its 
implementation until oct 1 
the delay voted on friday was part of a bill providing 184 
billion for fiscal 1990 for the treasury the postal service and 
several smaller agencies fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 
the legislation provides 56 billion for the internal revenue 
service 363 million more than this year most of the increase is 
to strengthen the irss ability to enforce tax laws and to process 
returns 
the bill includes 148 million for the new office of national 
drug control policy headed by former education secretary william 
bennett most of which he is to disperse to law enforcement 
agencies 
the bill also contains 21 million to upgrade security at vice 
president dan quayles official residence at the naval observatory 
in washington and an additional 200000 to help remodel and 
renovate the third floor of the residence which is used by 
quayles three children

hooker corp on friday ruled out a 
fire sale of its 18 billion assets while a team of advisers 
headed for the united states to investigate ways to head off 
foreclosure by us creditors 
hooker a major australian property company with significant 
us retail and real estate interests turned itself over to a 
courtappointed provisional liquidator on wednesday in one of 
australias biggest corporate collapses 
the sydneybased company which owns b altman amp co bonwit 
teller plus other us department stores and shopping malls owes 
the equivalent of 12 billion to more than 42 banks 
hooker has blamed its financial mess on sluggish us consumer 
spending exchange rate fluctuations and australian economic 
troubles such as high interest rates that have hurt operations 
there 
prime minister bob hawke said thursday the collapse had nothing 
to do with the fundamental strength of the australian economy 
we live in a situation where as far as this government is 
concerned we deregulated the market we let market forces oeprate 
and market forces have operated here 
john harkness appointed provisional liquidator on july 26 told 
a news conference friday he was in the process of assessing the 
situation and hoped to stabilize the corporation and then reduce 
its debt 
he said there would be no fire sale of assets and every attempt 
would be made to maximize their value the company has 10000 
employees and 13000 shareholders 
on friday subsidiary lj hooker homes a us residential 
construction company based in atlanta denied published reports 
that it was shutting down its operations as a result of this weeks 
developments 
brian mcgregor president of the company issued a statement in 
atlanta saying hookers financial problems had temporarily altered 
normal business operations at the subsidiary but we are still in 
business all of our employees are at work and we have no plans at 
this time to close down 
earlier this week first national bank of chicago reportedly 
started foreclosure proceedings on hookers richland fashion mall 
in columbia sc hookers financial advisers friday said they were 
aware of possible foreclosure but declined to comment further 
the officials also said a delegation was preparing to fly to the 
united states this weekend to consider whether hooker would seek 
court protection under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
a chapter 11 filing would protect the company from creditors 
lawsuits in the united states while hooker works out a plan of 
reorganization 
richard grellman of the accounting firm peat marwick hungerfords 
has been advising hooker and is part of the delegation he said the 
companys us interests are vital to its future 
the actions of creditors that hold specific securities is 
something that will have to be addressed very carefully grellman 
said whether chapter 11 or some other alternative is most 
appropriate is really the purpose of our trip 
grellman acknowledged that some of hookers us creditors have 
certain rights over some of the companys assets 
if they act within those rights then so be it he said 
clearly actions along those lines will have to be examined very 
carefully from the companys point of view 
harkness in ruling out a fire sale said we are running the 
business as it was run and will be continuing business as usual 
he said it was essential the company be given time to conduct an 
orderly sale of assets so their value could be maximized 
hookers other us interests include sakowitz inc parisian 
inc and merksamer jewelers inc it has interests in shopping 
malls commercial property developments and house building 
hooker was suspended from share trading on thursday george 
herscu who owns 50 percent of hooker resigned as chief executive

miller amp rhoads inc a centuryold 
regional department store chain battered by creditor claims filed 
friday for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a reorganization 
effort described by the firms president as a positive step to 
strengthen the company 
john e stokley president of the richmondbased chain of 15 
department stores said the bankruptcy filing will allow the 
company to continue business as usual 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code a company can 
function under court protection while it devises a way to pay the 
bills 
stokley said there were no immediate plans to close or sell 
stores or to make major changes within the company 
he said the decision to declare chapter 11 bankruptcy was 
triggered when an attempt to sell two stores in roanoke and 
lynchburg failed 
sale of the stores would have provided some relief from 
cashflow problems that have steadily worsened at miller amp rhoads 
the 104yearold company has been besieged by lenders at least 15 
of whom have filed lawsuits 
lawyers representing creditors said payments of claims have 
slowed or stopped recently 
stokley said the bankruptcy filing will allow the company to buy 
merchandise for the fall season even though the company will have 
to continue to pay cash for much of its goods 
the company does not have a target date for emerging from 
bankruptcy stokley said 
last december thenpresident and chief executive officer robert 
j rieland left the chain rieland was hired in april by the 
companys chief competitor thalhimer bros inc as president and 
ceo

crude oil futures fell through a key 
psychological price barrier friday as concern about excess supply 
and weakening demand continued to depress prices 
unleaded and heating oil futures ended the day mixed 
on the new york mercantile exchange the september contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
fell 19 cents to close at 1793 a 42gallon barrel the contract 
has fallen for six consecutive days and lost 158 since last 
friday when it cost 1951 a barrel 
among refined products traded on the exchange friday august 
unleaded gasoline rebounded 097 cent to finish at 5295 cents a 
gallon gasoline prices had weakened steadily over the last few 
weeks as consumption dropped due to exaggerated pump prices 
gasoline contracts for delivery in september and october also 
gained 
domestic heating oil for august delivery dropped 103 cents to 
4823 cents a gallon while other contract months also recorded 
declines 
analysts said crude oil broke through a psychologically 
important level of 18 as it continued to slide back to february 
levels the nearterm contract last closed lower on feb 23 at 
1783 a barrel 
bearish sentiment continued to plague the market in the face of 
weakening demand and growing supplies market observers said 
its a combination of feeling that august refinery runs will 
be lower and that opec is producing more than an ideal level 
said peter beutel assistant director of the energy group at elders 
futures inc 
refineries have eased off near peak runs of earlier in the 
summer as demand for gasoline slackened off in the last few weeks 
crude oil tends to pile up as refinery output slows 
also the organization of petroleum exporting countries is 
believed producing at least 2 million barrels a day above its 
selfimposed quota of 195 million barrels opec set a new 
production ceiling recently in an attempt to stabilize prices for 
middle eastern crude at 18 a barrel several of the 13member 
group however are producing above their limits 
andrew lebow senior broker and analyst with edampf man 
international futures inc said that crude prices could weaken 
further before they get better 
i dont think well see a price collapse lebow said as 
we head into the third and fourth quarters i think the market will 
show signs of improvement 
analysts said fridays gains in gasoline prices could continue 
we could start to see some increase in demand after all august 
is a big driving month beutel said

commodity futures prices tumbled friday as traders of gold 
crude oil soybeans and coffee reacted to bearish signals ranging 
from signs of an economic slowdown to ideal growing conditions in 
the corn belt 
the worsening economic outlook was reflected on new yorks 
commodity exchange where gold futures plunged 650 to 740 with 
the contract for delivery in august settling at 367 a troy ounce 
silver was 8 cents to 87 cents lower with september at 5183 a 
troy ounce 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
said the sharp drop in gold prices was due to the convergence of 
a number of moderately bearish factors chief among them the 
firming of the dollar friday against other other major currencies 
a stronger dollar discourages foreign purchases of us goods 
which could reduce the incentive for the federal reserve board to 
ease up on interest rates the fed has recently been allowing 
interest rates to fall in a bid to encourage borrowing and steer 
the economy away from a recession 
but economic data released this week have shown the economy 
slowing which has added to the pessimism in the gold market and 
discouraged investment buying of gold as an inflation hedge 
some analysts found little cause for alarm in golds decline 
noting that the market has held up well in recent weeks despite the 
darkening economic scenario 
i dont find todays selloff to be terribly depressing or 
negative said sharon ziemian of citibank in new york i think 
its quite reasonable 
crude oil futures prices continued a weeklong slide on the new 
york mercantile exchange that analysts have attributed to growing 
supplies and slackening demand 
west texas intermediate crude oil for september delivery fell 
below 18 a barrel for the first time since late february and some 
observers predicted further losses next week 
crude settled 14 cents to 19 cents lower with september at 
1793 a barrel heating oil was 55 cent to 103 cents lower with 
august at 4823 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 54 cent 
lower to 97 cent higher with august at 5295 cents a gallon 
soybeans for nearterm delivery plunged below 650 a bushel for 
the first time in 16 months on the chicago board of trade amid 
expectations of continued improvement in midwestern growing 
conditions 
other grain futures also closed lower largely in sympathy with 
the plummeting soybean market wheats losses were limited by 
rumors of new export business the agriculture department announced 
after the close that it had targeted algeria for sales of 1 million 
metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices 
soybeans settled 1 cents to 19 cents lower with august at 649 
a bushel wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with september 
at 387 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with 
september at 229 a bushel oats were 6 cents to 8 cents lower 
with september at 136 a bushel 
coffee futures fell to a new 13year low on on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange amid aggressive selling by 
coffeeproducing countries in an escalating battle for market 
share the price drop follows the international coffee 
organizations july 3 suspension of coffee export quotas 
coffee settled 120 cents to 225 cents lower with september at 
8202 cents a pound 
cattle futures settled mostly lower on the chicago mercantile 
exchange in cautious trading ahead of the usdas semiannual cattle 
inventory report the report released after the close confirmed 
perceptions of a modest expansion of the us cattle herd and was 
considered neutral for futures prices 
live cattle were 18 cent lower to 05 cent higher with august 
at 7257 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 40 cent 
lower with august at 8307 cents a pound live hogs were 27 cent 
lower to 10 cent higher with august at 4605 cents a pound frozen

treasury bond below 8 percent for the first time since spring 1987 
strength in the bond market eventually should spill over into 
lower rates for consumers on mortgage car and education loans 
the bond market rally also means the federal government will 
have to pay lower interest rates on its issue of new debt next week 
eight percent had been viewed as a great barrier and 
economists said it would take a very unusual set of developments to 
get us there short of a recession and lo and behold were there 
even without a recession said maury harris a painewebber inc 
economist

report that indicated slow economic growth it said personal 
incomes rose a lackluster 03 percent in june as consumer spending 
declined for a second straight month 
bondholders generally welcome news of a slowdown in the economy 
because it implies less demand for goods and services easing the 
risk of inflation which erodes the value of such fixedincome 
investments as bonds

per 1000 in face amount after gaining nearly 1 point in the 
previous session its yield fell to 7985 percent from 802 percent

percent all month helping push it below was the federal reserves

in the second quarter 
the bond had dipped below 8 percent during the july 11 session 
but friday was the first day since april 8 1987 that it had 
finished below that level 
whats happening is that people are sort of coming in off the 
sidelines to buy bonds as the federal reserve easing is becoming 
more apparent and the inflation outlook is looking pretty 
reasonable said john slosberg senior fixedincome analyst at 
technical data global markets group in boston 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments rose between 532 and point intermediate maturities 
advanced between about point and longterm issues gained about

a federal judge on friday lifted a ban on 
american telephone amp telegraph co owning the computer data 
videotex financial and other information services it transmits on 
its wires 
us district judge harold greene said enough competition exists 
in the transmission and provision of socalled electronic 
publishing services to allow atampt to enter the fields on aug 24 
atampt in april had asked greene to revoke the ban which was in 
the form of a consent decree imposed when atampt divested itself of 
its local phone companies in 1984 
the 1984 judgment stipulated that the electronic publishing ban 
would be lifted in seven years unless shown it should continue the 
ban was established aug 24 1982 and greene who oversaw the atampt 
breakup said he intended to lift it after seven years 
greene said the ban was appropriate in 1982 because the 
electronic publishing industry was in its infancy and atampt had de 
facto control of the longdistance network 
but he said the ban should operate only for the period 
necessary to establish conditions conducive to free and fair 
competition 
after seven years had passed greene said the burden of proof 
would be on any opponents of removal to show that competitive 
conditions clearly required maintaining a ban 
atampt in april argued that the electronic publishing industry was 
healthy and had significant competition in longdistance from mci 
communications corp us sprint communications co and others atampt 
controls about 68 percent of the nations longdistance business 
atampt said major electronic publishing companies included 
knightridder inc for online database services citicorp dow 
jones and reuters for securities quotations and financial 
information dun amp bradstreet corp and trw inc for credit data 
and general electric co international business machines corp and 
sears amp roebuck inc for videotex services 
no one has contradicted the thrust of these contentions and 
no one is contending that current competitive conditions warrant 
retention of the electronic publishing restriction in its 
entirety greene said in his ruling 
he noted the justice department had decided that atampt could not 
exert bottleneck control over longdistance services because of 
its competitors the federal communications commission concluded 
the same thing greene said 
atampt said the decision reflected greenes thorough 
understanding of forces at work in todays highly competitive and 
complex telecommunications marketplace 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the company would not comment on 
what electronic business business options it was considering 
atampt said in april it had no plans to enter the electronic 
yellow pages and television businesses two areas of special 
concern to the seven regional bell telephone companies spun off 
from atampt in 1984 and to the broadcast and cable tv industries 
some observers noting some major failures by companies 
attempting to develop a us videotex market have said atampt may 
not rush into the electronic publishing business immediately 
but electronic yellow pages may be an area of interest to atampt 
since the regional bell companies are barred from that business 
in 1987 greene gave the regional bell companies permission to 
transmit but not originate information services which include 
electronic publishing and data processing and related computer 
services 
replying to atampts april filing several companies requested 
that atampt be prohibited from providing audiotex and data processing 
services because it could dominate this infant industry 
but greene said sufficient competition exists in the 
transmission of audiotex services and he had no antitrust authority 
to assist relatively small or weak audiotex providers 
greene also said he was not deterred by assertions by the 
american newspaper publishers association consumer federation of 
america and an audiotex provider omnicall that independent 
providers are hampered because they cant switch longdistance 
carriers and keep their 800 or 900 numbers
