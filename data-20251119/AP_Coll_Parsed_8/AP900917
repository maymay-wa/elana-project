the mother of aslain utah tourist testified 
monday that civilians not police came to the familys rescue 
while her son lay fatally stabbed in a manhattan subway station 
the family of mugging victim brian watkins returned to new york 
from provo utah for the first time since the sept 2 murder to 
testify before the us senate transportation appropriations 
subcommittee which is exploring ways to pay for improved subway 
safety 
karen watkins her voice strong and unwavering recalled what 
happened after a gang of muggers attacked the family and stabbed 
her son brian 22 
i had asked the token booth clerk to call 911 he just ignored 
me so i ran outside there were two pay phones out there that were 
being used at the time by two gentlemen and i asked them to call 
911 
a man told her there was another phone on the train platform he 
ran downstairs with her jumped the turnstile and opened an exit 
door so she could bypass the turnstile and get onto the platform to 
call 911 
mrs watkins said the token booth clerk never said a word to 
me at all my son was lying not more than 5 feet from him but he 
did not respond 
the transit authority has disputed this account saying the 
clerk used an emergency phone in his booth to summon police and 
paramedics 
brians brother todd testified that it took about 10 minutes 
for official help to arrive after the 911 call 
watkins a former high school tennis star was on an annual trip 
to the us open tennis tournament with his brother mother father 
and sisterinlaw 
they were attacked at a station in midtown manhattan at around 
1030 pm 
a group of youths set upon watkins father sherwin slashing 
his pants with a knife and stealing a money clip containing about 
200 in cash and some credit cards brian and todd interceded when 
mrs watkins was punched in the face 
brian was stabbed in the chest he collapsed while chasing the 
suspects and died 40 minutes later at a hospital 
i dont think there was anything that really alerted us to 
the imminent danger mrs watkins said 
maybe looking back we should have been a little more careful 
as we watched these young boys run into the subway and not pay the 
toll we just thought they didnt want to pay the fare and were 
running to catch the train 
eight suspects have been charged with seconddegree murder in 
watkins killing 
todd watkins read a statement on the familys behalf that said 
the death of brian watkins has shocked the city of new york it 
has made new yorkers realize that there is no safe place in the 
city and that crime is rampant 
the oneday hearing was held by sen alfonse damato rny 
and sen frank r lautenberg dnj 
zenia mucha a spokeswoman for damato said the senators 
office invited the watkinses to testify she said an airline 
donated airfare and a hotel donated accommodations

scores of children are hurt each year by lawn 
darts despite a ban on the dangerous toys that have killed and 
maimed a study found 
i want people across the country to simply throw these things 
way said dr sara sotiropoulos who led researchers at the 
childrens mercy hospital in kansas city mo 
even though the sale of these has been banned there are 
supposedly 10 million sets of these in garages across the 
country ms sotiropoulos said monday in a telephone interview 
lawn darts were designed for use outside in a game played like 
horseshoes they have heavy pointed tips 
theyre just too dangerous said ms sotiropoulos now 
practicing pediatrics in bellingham wash 
in the study published in the september issue of the american 
journal of diseases of children ms sotiropoulos and colleagues 
examined data on 76 children injured by the darts from 1973 to 
1988 
three of those children were killed by the darts and more than 
half suffered serious head injuries such as skull fractures and 
brain lesions she said 
congress and the consumer product safety commission banned lawn 
darts in the fall of 1988 until the ban lawn dart injuries were 
responsible for an estimated 675 emergency room visits a year 
according to the cpsc 
in 1989 after the ban an estimated 439 such visits were blamed 
on the darts department statistics show 
the study examined data on children aged 19 months to 18 years 
including 69 cases reported by the cpsc of those 49 percent were 
hospitalized and 13 percent suffered lasting damage such as 
blindness or brain damage 
the six additional children studied all suffered serious head 
injuries they included a 7yearold boy injured when a thrown dart 
pierced his cheek and entered his brain ms sotiropoulos said 
the boy who was admitted to the kansas city hospital 
contracted meningitis because of the injury and remains in a coma 
nearly two years after he was injured she said 
pediatricians should educate parents about this hazard and 
encourage them to discard all lawn darts the study said 
the darts were manufactured by several companies which are 
prohibited from making the devices under the 1988 ban said cpsc 
spokesman ken giles

judge as a master manipulator was sentenced monday to life in 
prison for persuading his teenage daughter to kill his wife 
david arnold brown 38 displayed no emotion as superior court 
judge donald a mccartin told the affluent businessman his sentence 
left no possibility of parole 
prosecutors convinced jurors that brown plotted his wifes death 
so he could marry his teenage sisterinlaw who he later tried to 
kill 
the circumstances of this case are unbelievable mccartin 
said you are a scary person for you to be able to get one of 
your children to kill your wife you make charlie manson look 
like a piker 
in a separate matter monday brown was given a sixyear prison 
term for a jailhouse plot to kill his current wife another man and 
jeoffrey robinson the lead prosecutor in his case the sentence is 
to run concurrently with the life sentence 
youre just a master manipulator mccartin said i dont 
know how you could do that to another human being 
defense attorney gary pohlson said the sentences were exactly 
what i expected 
brown owner of a computer company was convicted in june of 
masterminding his wife lindas death and persuading his then 
14yearold daughter cinnamon to commit the slaying 
cinnamon brown spent three years in a youth prison before she 
told authorities that her father planned the murder and urged her 
to carry it out on march 19 1985 
while the girl was jailed brown collected 835000 in life 
insurance taken out on his wife and married patricia bailey the 
younger sister of the slain woman

guilty to participating in the scheme and was imprisoned by the 
california youth authority in may 1989

a survey of more than 1000 fledgling teachers 
finds them full of optimism that they can make a difference but 
fearful that they are unprepared for problemplagued youngsters 
the poll of teachers entering classes for the first time this 
fall issued monday by metropolitan life insurance co found that 
99 percent believe that all children can learn and 83 percent said 
they were confident they can make a difference in pupils lives 
but 58 percent said they wish they had more practical training 
before entering the classroom twothirds said they believe all 
teachers should be required to take a national standardized test to 
prove their qualifications 
and 45 percent agreed that even the best teachers will have 
difficulty succeeding with more than twothirds of their students 
threefourths believe many children come to school with so many 
problems that its hard for them to become good students 
the survey was the eighth poll of teacher attitudes conducted by 
the insurance company since 1984 
what is most striking is the enormous idealism with which 
new teachers are approaching their jobs the survey concluded 
before getting caught up in the realities of the job they have a 
very strong faith in what children and they themselves can 
achieve 
sharply contrasting with that optimism a survey of more than 
21000 veteran teachers released two weeks ago by the carnegie 
foundation for the advancement of teaching found that 61 percent 
consider morale at their schools fair or poor it also found a 
majority souring on the progress of school reform 
i can almost guarantee that unless government and other 
institutions start solving the outofschool problems of kids and 
unless our schools change dramatically to support teaching and 
learning five years from now this idealistic and committed group 
of new teachers will be leaving the profession in droves said 
albert shanker president of the american federation of teachers 
reacting to the latest poll 
the 1002 teachers surveyed by met life were selected randomly 
from a list of this springs teacher college graduates compiled by 
the american association of colleges for teacher education 
the survey was conducted by telephone in july and august by 
louis harris and associates inc it had a margin of sampling error 
of plus or minus three percentage points 
met life said it plans to poll the same group next spring to 
determine their attitudes after a year of classroom experience 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
the nations largest teacher union said the survey pointed up the 
need for all prospective teachers to gain classroom experience 
working with a mentor teacher 
he also called it disturbing that one out of five new teachers 
surveyed felt unprepared to teach students of different ethnic 
backgrounds 
 
editors note copies of the survey will be available later 
this month for free by writing to metropolitan life insurance co

the first american ground 
forces to reach saudi arabia have been given a new mission that 
will take them away from the front lines but would put them even 
closer to any combat 
the 82nd airborne is illequipped to fight the strong iraqi 
army but because of its readiness for swift deployment it was the 
first us army combat unit to hit saudi soil under operation 
desert shield 
now as heavier tankfighting hardware arrives the military 
wants the paratroopers to get ready for another job perhaps to 
parachute into iraq or kuwait if necessary top officers say 
the 82nd some members of which spent last christmas in panama 
began arriving within a day of president bushs aug 8 decision 
to send troops to help defend the saudi kingdom from possible 
attack by iraqi forces 
with vietnamera m551 sheridan light tanks the 82nd would have 
proved no match for iraqi forces had they decided to continue 
south from kuwait with their heavy soviet tanks 
in those early days we were as much a political statement 
about the united states position as a deterrent force one 82nd 
officer said recently for some time there were a lot fewer of us 
here than they were telling the folks back home 
another 82nd member who like his senior officer spoke on 
condition of anonymity said he was confined to base at fort bragg 
nc waiting to be sent to saudi arabia when he read in the paper 
that his unit already was en route 
maybe we had saddam hussein fooled too he said i thought 
it was pretty funny 
the 82nd was deployed in northeast saudi arabia to secure 
airstrips and port facilities for arriving us forces it also 
formed a thin defensive line against iraqi aggression about 150 
miles from the kuwaiti border 
the units desert base was first named allamerican city then 
changed to champion city because of saudi objections 
as other troops began to arrive the 82nd conducted desert 
exercises to get used to the searing heat and last week held 
drills with the sheridans which are light enough to be dropped by 
air into battle 
now with heavy armored divisions from the army and marines 
taking up positions much further north the 82nd has begun to pull 
back 
paratroopers dont fight tanks a senior army officer said 
this past week its time we get the 82nd into a mission that 
fits the unit 
that new mission according to sources who agreed to dicuss it 
on grounds that specific details and locations not be disclosed is 
more in line with the 82nds reputation as what the army calls its 
premier forced entry unit 
if orders come to take part in an offensive against iraq top 
officers in the 82nd believe the unit could be called on to drop 
into kuwait or southern iraq behind the occupation forces and 
attempt to cut off their supply lines 
the unit recently ordered a parachute shipment from home 
rules prohibit saying how many members of the 82nd are in saudi 
arabia but most of the 15000member division has been deployed 
over the past week a brigadesize detachment from the 82nd was 
pulled back to a camp not far from a saudi air base 
the remaining units likely will receive new orders in the next 
two to three weeks provided that expected heavy armor arrives 
the pullback will continue unless hostilities break out 
there had been talk of pulling the unit out of saudi arabia and 
stationing it elsewhere in the persian gulf region but it now 
appears the new base camp will be within saudi arabia the sources 
said

doug stickler is sticking his neck out for 
ostrich meat 
stickler who with his older brother mike have an ostrich spread 
in the middle of oklahoma panhandle cattle country predict meat 
from the bareheaded bird will be the health food of the 90s 
the sticklers have brought four of their flightless flock to the 
los angeles county fair in pomona 
it wont be long until you see people eating kentucky fried 
ostrich stickler said in a telephone interview sunday its 
definitely the future 
the turpin okla rancher said the meat is low in cholesterol 
high in protein and tastes like steak with the texture of veal 
stickler said doctors and nutrition experts who have seen the 
future are investing in ostriches 
cost per pound 10 since there are so few of the birds in the 
united states but doug figures in 20 years hell be giving the 
beef a run for its money 
at first we got a lot of teasing from the area ranchers they 
thought we were crazy he said well those same ones that 
teased us have been coming down to see what were doing 
stickler got into the ostrich breeding business in 1986 he 
bought his first birds from ostrichfarming monks in oklahoma city 
two years later the sticklers moved their 10000 head of cattle 
out and moved the birds in about 175 of them now the brothers 
have sold more than 300 chicks nationwide prices range from 500 
to 3000 per chick 
you just feed em water em and leave em alone he said 
with cattle you worked from dark to dark back home it takes 30 
minutes to do the ostrich chores 
stickler said that according to the american ostrich 
association there are more than 5000 ostriches being bred across 
the country the association predicts an ostrich population boom of 
75000 to 100000 by mid1990

the 265th quartermaster detachment of the south 
carolina national guard is one of the reserve units called up for 
operation desert shield national writer fred bayles followed the 
14 guardsmen as they prepared for deployment and he was with them 
aboard the sandbox express 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
welcome aboard gentlemen 
said the air force loadmaster youll be flying freedom bird to 
the worlds largest beach without water 
the joke didnt register with the men of the 265th quartermaster 
detachment after a night of delays they just wanted to get on the 
c141 and sleep the expected 19 hours it would take to fly from 
georgia to saudi arabia 
but sleep would not be easy to come by this night for the south 
carolina national guard unit 
the hold of the big cargo plane was packed there was a scant 
two feet between the units four pickup trucks and the row of red 
web seats along the side of the plane 
the 14 men couldnt stretch their legs they couldnt lie down 
they couldnt read in the dim gloom of the cargo hold and they 
couldnt stay warm 
as the plane climbed to 37000 feet the temperature in the hold 
dropped to the low 60s the men rolled down the sleeves of their 
desert uniforms buttoned up their collars and shivered through the 
long night 
the only way you can do it is stand up for a while to get warm 
and then hope you can fall asleep said sgt hullie cohen who 
served in the air force before joining the guard 
the water purification unit from allendale sc deployed for 
saudi arabia late friday after 16 days of training at fort stewart 
ga boarded the plane just before midnight their m16s were on 
their shoulders and they carried white plastic bags with water 
rations and a toiletry bag containing toothbrush toothpaste 
razors shaving cream sunscreen bug spray skin conditioner lip 
balm eye drops and deodorant 
this is good enough for a vacation said sgt john williams 
but the next nine hours were no vacation 
the plane the name sandbox express stenciled on its side 
looked huge on the floodlit runway but once aboard space was a 
premium 
the web seats dug into the men as they tried to get comfortable 
some used their softsided canteens as pillows conversation was 
impossible the engines roar was hardly muted by the yellow foam 
plugs sticking out of each mans ears 
riding in the windowless hold was like cruising through the 
ocean in the belly of a whale 
the plane stopped at torrejon air base near madrid for fuel and 
a fresh crew giving the 265th three hours to wash up in the 
crowded bathroom send postcards home and watch a clint eastwood 
movie on a big screen television set up in a hanger 
spc mark rooker 20 the youngest member of the unit spent his 
time staring at the scenery rooker hasnt traveled much and he 
was fascinated by the flat landscape 
id like to come back here someday he said 
back on the plane the men ate an air force box lunch of ham and 
cheese sandwiches and packaged spanish pastries some visited the 
cockpit crew as the plane passed from spanish to french air 
controllers over the mediterranean 
seven hours later the plane rolled to a stop at a saudi 
airport it was 3 am local time the men scrambled down the 
ladder in full combat gear carrying the south carolina state flag 
but the only one to greet them was a bored sergeant who led them 
past giant cargo planes and a road busy with truck traffic 
they stopped at an intersection where a half dozen men were busy 
filling sandbags in the glare of a trucks headlights 
the 265th watched a little stupefied from their long flight 
ok said sgt earnest deloach the jokes over lets go 
back home

president mikhail s gorbachev driven by the 
radicals who control the parliament of the largest soviet republic 
seems to have accepted their prescription for the gasping soviet 
economy capitalism 
the economys fall into depression was a major impetus but the 
final push came from russian president boris yeltsin who won 
approval for the drastic reforms in the russian parliament this 
week and forced gorbachevs hand 
yeltsin threatened to pursue his economic revolution in russia 
which contains half the soviet people and threequarters of the 
countrys land mass with or without gorbachevs support 
gorbachev went along 
the economic plan he distributed to the national parliament on 
friday 95 percent coincides with the russian plan russian 
deputy prime minister grigory yavlinsky told his parliament on 
saturday 
that is an exaggeration gorbachev rejected some key points and 
a parliamentary battle remains to be fought but the comment was a 
good indication that the russian radicals feel they have already 
won 
in the five years since he came to power proclaiming the need 
for reform gorbachev has tinkered with the communist system 
trying to fill the barren shelves of soviet stores 
now he has thrown his support behind an economic reform plan 
full of ideas that warm the hearts of capitalists and horrify 
diehard communists private land home ownership merit pay and 
profits 
it also contains the thorns of capitalism unemployment factory 
closings bankruptcies and rising prices in the first months of 
switching to a market economy the soviet union is likely to feel 
the full pain of these thorns 
gorbachev this week was defensive thumping his fist in 
parliament as he told soviet legislators such radical change would 
have been impossible earlier 
a year and a half ago we were just talking about pluralism 
he said referring to the soviet unions dramatic switch to 
multicandidate elections 
if he had heeded calls to change from a centrally planned to a 
market economy then gorbachev said do you think anything would 
have come of it thats nonsense 
we needed all that time to think about things otherwise 
there would have been such a tragedy such confusion in the 
country that we never could have escaped it he said 
now however the changes must come quickly gorbachev admitted 
the old structures are falling apart and the new ones are not 
yet formed he said there is no system in the true sense of 
the word 
his own economic reform plan says the country already has 
entered an economic depression with rising foreign debt and 
declining ability to pay the countrys international economic 
position the plan said is catastrophic 
as a result gorbachevs economic plan says the gradual 
transition to a market economy proposed by soviet prime minister 
nikolai ryzhkov would be too slow 
without urgent action we would be forced to choose between 
hyperinflation and direct seizure of cash from the population and 
enterprises the plan says 
ryzhkov went on national television saturday night to argue for 
his moderate approach to reform and to insist on retaining through 
1991 the rigid soviet bureaucracy that now runs the economy 
in arguing against the russian republics plan ryzhkov 
predicted it would lead to a 30 percent drop in the countrys 
standard of living 
but ryzhkovs plan which calls for dramatic price increases on 
jan 1 without fundamental structural changes is so unpopular that 
legislators have called for his resignation and about 50000 
muscovites demonstrated near red square in a cold rain sunday 
evening calling for ryzhkov to step down 
still remaining however is the battle over sections of the 
russian plan that would strip the central government of much of its 
power 
gorbachev has rejected that notion including calls to transform 
the country into an economic association like the european 
community his plan also deletes the russian call for republic laws 
to supersede national legislation 
neither gorbachev nor any other soviet politician has dared 
define the coming changes as capitalism 
instead officials say its time to kill off the dying 
authoritarian system and get on with what they call normal 
life 
 
editors note ann imse based in moscow has covered the 
soviet union for the associated press for two years

a human shield take my mullahinlaw 
please barrumpbump from the top 10 lists of late night to 
the political humor of will durst and harry shearer humorists are 
finding comedy in the gulf crisis 
on aug 2 iraq invaded kuwait and erased its kuwaitibank visa 
cards 10 billion tab that same night late night with david 
letterman offered saddam husseins top ten reasons for invading 
kuwait 
reason no 6 to impress jodie foster no 3 didnt have 
enough fuel and supplies to invade the moon and no 1 drum 
roll because the sand is always grainier on the other side 
of the border 
nobody said its easy being a jester in the court of public 
opinion 
its hard coming up with the lighter side of armageddon 
said will durst a comic who specializes in politics and writes a 
weekly column for the san francisco examiner saddam is funny the 
invasion wasnt 
when he invaded it was tough durst said i turned it on 
him and made him the focus you know saddam is a bad guy because 
switzerland is angry at him imagine switzerland the aunt bea 
of the un 
saddam hussein is such a bad guy that if he were an american 
john sununu would still be governor of new hampshire 
i call saddam hussein a yuppie his motives are something we 
can all understand greed i mean this is a corporate raider with 
tanks 
at least this guy has a motive we can relate to because as 
americans we never got past the suicideterrorist thing i mean 
how do those people get paid is it a union thing 
durst gets serious too its obvious that america would 
rather sacrifice its boys than carpool saddam he said is the 
symptom not the problem taking out hussein would be like whiting 
out a tumor on an xray 
political impressionist jim morris made his name portraying 
ronald reagan as an amiable dimwit but these days his focus is 
george bush and his handling of the gulf crisis morris says its a 
sensitive topic and hes very careful 
i am a lot kinder to the president in this situation than i am 
when he wants to cut funding for school lunch programs morris 
said 
then in the voice he calls a cross between liberace jack 
nicholson and mister rogers morris drawls i dont hafta 
defend the way i been handlin the crisis m doors always open 
m never there but m doors always open 
some top comedians arent doing the gulf crisis robert klein 
has nothing on the middle east said his publicist glen schwartz 
richard belzer said hes too worried about the situation to find it 
funny 
my problem is that americans have such a short attention span 
that theyre going to get bored and almost will something to 
happen belzer said id rather be bored for the rest of my 
life than have one 18yearold get his head blown off because were 
not prudent enough to conserve oil 
harry shearer a comedian writer star and coauthor of the 
pseudodocumentary this is spinal tap and occasional voice on 
the simpsons uses the gulf crisis in le show his eekly 
national public radio program 
le show is basically a topically oriented show shearer 
said im almost obliged to do material about the crisis for the 
last four weeks it has pretty much been the only subject 
saddams appearing on tv with hostages prompted shearer to 
imagine him savvier about western media and getting robin leach to 
gush breathlessly over his lifestyle and pleasure palaces that 
rival the pashas of persia 
then there was shearers sketch on the last woman hostage 
leaving blockaded iraq when the iraqis detain her suspicious of 
her 5 oclock shadow 
it turns out shes a transsexual who has been cut off as it 
were from her supplies of hormones and depilatories the iraqis 
dont know what to make of her should she stay or should she go 
a war without fighting is funny shearer acknowledges that gulf 
crisis humor risks offending people when a good joke is suddenly 
made tasteless by events but hes also quite careful about his 
timing 
i do stuff so close to when it airs that im not going to get 
caught by surprise if something happens shearer said 
i think it doesnt start to get risky really until body bags 
start coming back then all the equations start changing

the house and senate have passed 
multimilliondollar bills establishing a civilian national 
service corps for young people but originators of the idea say 
the differing bills bear little resemblance to what they had in 
mind 
the committee picked up the ball but forgot to run rep 
dave mccurdy dokla one of the sponsors of national service 
said after the house passed its bill last thursday this bill is 
not national service 
nonetheless the 193 million bill the house approved on a voice 
vote after long debate bears the title national service act it now 
goes to a conference committee to work out differences with the 
senate which passed a 125 million bill that although less 
costly is more ambitious 
mccurdy and other original sponsors hope the final version will 
include a provision in the senates bill a 35 million 
demonstration program that will test their idea for linking 
national youth service with financial aid incentives 
its a plan that the house did not include the chairman of the 
house panel that wrote the bill retiring rep augustus hawkins 
dcalif opposed the idea and said his committee categorically 
rejects any linkage between service and student financial 
assistance 
the idea of a national service corps to encourage young people 
to do social works the nation otherwise couldnt afford has been 
bound up in political differences that go beyond pride of 
authorship 
president bush uttered the phrase a thousand points of light 
in his nominating speech and later refined it into a modest 25 
million plan to establish a clearinghouse for community service 
publicizing successful projects and encouraging new ones 
critics of that idea however concluded it would do little to 
actually support an organized effort harnessing the energy and time 
of young people to do constructive social or environmental work 
benefiting their communities 
moderate and conservative democrats who lead the democratic 
leadership council a group formed to counterbalance what they see 
as the more liberal national party organization proposed a more 
sweeping plan in january 1989 
their bill would have made student financial aid contingent on a 
fulltime stint in the military or in lowwage community service 
their bill would have phased out current forms of student aid in 
five years 
it would amount to a civilian gi bill a civilian program 
comparable to the benefits that encourage military service 
according to its sponsors led by mccurdy in the house and sens 
sam nunn dga and charles robb dva 
their plan met stiff resistance however and in the senate they 
settled for the scaledback pilot program participants could 
receive vouchers for use toward college a first home purchase or 
establishment of a small business worth 5000 for one yeas 
service 
i havent dropped my original thinking on the subject but i 
do think we ought to go slowly and determine what works nunn 
said 
critics who include liberal democrats as well as republicans 
said tying aid to service would penalize lowincome students while 
allowing the affluent to escape service obligations supporters 
however said lowincome students already have to work to 
supplement the meager support they get from existing student aid 
programs 
the houses bill provides grants to states and local school 
systems to encourage volunteer activity by young people and 
establishes youth conservation and service corps to do 
environmental and social projects 
sponsors of the democratic leadership councils plan say 
volunteerism is different and more limited in scope than what they 
have in mind they say hawkins committee with its ties to the 
establishment education and labor lobbies basically added money to 
existing programs and came up with little more than a traditional 
youth jobs program 
from our point of view the house really missed the point of 
national service said will marshall head of the progressive 
policy institute a democratic think tank that has pushed the idea 
the committee missed an opportunity for a dynamic fresh 
approach because members did not want to touch previously created 
sacred student aid programs mccurdy said 
but hawkins contends his bill will encourage volunteer work and 
responds to the same concerns that the president noted when he 
proposed his points of light initiative in his inaugural address 
this bill hawkins said is an attempt to make the concept 
of service more central to americans life and work

alqatif saudi arabia ap shiite moslems in saudi arabia 
long considered a potential fifth column say they ignore calls 
from fundamentalist leaders of their sect in iran to fight the 
americans in the middle east 
but many in the estimated 1 millionstrong shiite community 
complain that discrimination by the saudi government has left them 
with a wrenching sense of their minority status 
the subject is so sensitive that most shiites dont want to talk 
at all about their treatment 
its such a difficult question said one student its 
like punching us in the heart 
shiites interviewed at random over two weeks said they cant 
find jobs no matter how educated they are 
they also say their freedom to practice their religious rituals 
is sharply curtailed and they live under a cloud of suspicion as 
iranian sympathizers 
nobody feels free said the student who spoke on condition 
he not be identified 
the shiites are concentrated in the eastern province which 
contains most of saudi arabias massive oil deposits font of the 
kingdoms wealth 
saudi arabias estimated 10 million people are overwhelmingly 
members of the mainstream sunni moslem sect it has for centuries 
been at odds with the breakaway shiites who form the majority of 
irans 55 million people 
the split goes back to a 7th century battle over who would 
succeed the prophet mohammed as leader of all moslems 
ali the prophets soninlaw was defeated and killed in a 
battle in what is today iraq his defeat produced the shiite 
faction 
distrust of shiites in saudi arabia is widespread especially 
since many saudis adhere to a puritanical sunni sect the wahhabis 
last week iranian spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
called on moslems in the region to fight a holy war to drive the 
americans and their western allies from the persian gulf 
but like all saudis most shiites say the threat from iraqs 
saddam hussein justifies deploying us troops in the region 
the true believer whether shiite or sunni is against an 
american presence conceded a shiite gold seller but theyd 
rather have the united states here for a while than saddam 
one of their main concerns is that the americans might start 
fighting iran and bring a resumption of the largescale arrests 
carried out by saudi arabia during the 198088 iraniraq war 
the 1979 revolution in iran that propelled ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini to power alarmed conservative saudi arabia khomeini 
wanted to export his islamic revolution and called for the ousting 
of the saudi monarchy 
radical moslems took over the holy mosque in mecca in 1979 and 
shiites inspired by iran plotted to topple the governments in 
neighboring bahrain and kuwait 
saudi diplomats overseas were shot and there was a rash of 
bombings in the kingdom more than 400 pilgrims mostly iranians 
were killed in mecca in 1987 in what the saudis said was 
iranianinspired riots 
saudi arabia clamped a quota on the number of pilgrims citing 
renovation work in the mecca iran claimed it was a deliberate move 
to cut its usual contingent of 150000 pilgrims by twothirds 
in april 1988 riyadh broke off relations with tehran citing 
its support for terrorism and subversion 
a year ago the saudis executed 16 kuwaiti shiites for a bombing 
in mecca that renewed suspicions they were still a potential nest 
of conspirators a diplomat said 
the 20yearold brother of a teacher in this predominantly 
shiite city was among those arrested at the time jailed for eight 
months his treatment included beatings cigarette burns and 
solitary confinement the teacher claimed 
they asked him over and over again do you have any connection 
with iran said the teacher who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
the main thing here is that theyre afraid of the revolution 
in iran if they were suspicious of anybody they took him he 
said 
that suspicion abated with khomeinis death last year and the 
more moderate policies of president hashemi rafsanjani that 
followed but the pilgrimage dispute still sours relations 
diplomats note the eastern provinces new governor king fahds 
son mohammed has worked hard to improve services in shiite areas 
and been markedly less sweeping with arrests 
the saudi policy has been to win them over with kindness while 
dealing very firmly with any incidents that occur said one 
western diplomat dissidents are still put in jail to cool off 
but shiites said the lingering effect is an inability to get any 
government jobs in a country where most of the people depend on the 
state payroll 
for decades shiites had formed the majority of workers at 
aramco the stateowned oil company thats now seen as a security 
risk 
shiites say note of them have been hired by the government since 
the iranian revolution 
the main problem is discrimination one man complained if 
anyone from qatif applies for a job they take the papers give him 
an interview appointment and then forget him how can he live 
government officials deny there is any active dicrimination 
policy 
the other big sore point is the ban on certain shiite religious 
traditions such as selfflagellation during the ashoura holiday or 
mentioning the name ali a shiite saint in prayer calls 
sermons are banned in most mosques and its impossible to get 
permission to build new mosques shiites said 
any violation is considered a political act and leads to 
imprisonment the shiites said 
all saudis are part of society and have to respect the 
feelings of the majority said a saudi prince speaking on 
condition he not be named

one by one lawmakers grappling with a us 
economy in decline stood on the house floor venting their anger at 
american allies unwilling to reach into their deep pockets and help 
the campaign against iraq 
the rhetoric was fierce and the main target was japan 
there is a tollfree number that our friends and allies call 
whenever they run into trouble 800usafree said rep byron 
dorgan dnd japan more than any other nation has rung up the 
biggest tab on this tollfree line 
defense secretary dick cheney had told congress the us 
military buildup in the persian gulf region could cost as much as 
15 billion budget negotiators meanwhile were locked in a 
struggle to trim 50 billion from the federal deficit 
suddenly japans 1 billion offer of assistance in the gulf 
crisis began to look miserly and the house responded 
on a 37053 vote it approved an amendment last week forcing 
japan to foot the entire bill for stationing 50000 us troops in 
the asian nation or begin losing them at a rate of 5000 a year 
rep pat schroeder dcolo said the house was giving japan a 
good swift kick 
two days later japan said it would contribute an additional 3 
billion for international forces in the gulf region and for nations 
suffering from the un embargo on iraq 
when youre tough you get respect and you get a response 
said rep david bonior dmich sponsor of the house measure 
but some lawmakers saw it differently 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on europe and the middle east said the house had hit 
the japanese across the snout with a twobyfour a move that 
was counterproductive to us efforts to obtain more allied help 
against iraqi president saddam hussein 
hamilton who voted against the measure said he had spoken to 
officials in japan and they were offended by the house vote 
it complicates our task even if it does not become law 
hamilton said 
sen bob kerrey dneb shared similar concerns as the senate 
last week approved 972 a resolution saying the united states 
should prosecute saddam and other iraqi leaders as war 
criminals if hostilities break out in the gulf 
he said he feared that other nations would mistake the 
nonbinding resolution as something much more serious than just an 
expression of the senates anger and frustration 
i appreciate this is a sort of an amendment that looks 
relatively harmless kerrey said but noting that iraq was 
holding americans hostage he added what happens if this in 
fact sends precisely the opposite message im not skilled in the 
psychology of somebody who takes hostages and holds them 
similar consternation was evident in april when the arab world 
was affronted when congress approved a resolution declaring 
jerusalem to be israels capital 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas supported the 
resolution but after meetings with leaders of four arab nations 
egypt jordan syria and iraq realized the repercussions from the 
congressional action 
these kinds of resolutions hastily prepared and even more 
hastily passed are nonsense dangerous nonsense and we ought to 
do something about it dole said

ace feather detective roxie laybourne always 
gets her bird even when the evidence is a mere wisp of fluffy 
down 
from her cluttered aerie on the top floor of the national museum 
of natural history amid storage bins containing more than 600000 
specimens of stuffed birds the hawkeyed mrs laybourne reigns as 
the nations foremost authority on feathers 
give her a tuft of tail feathers and roxie nobody calls her 
mrs laybourne can tell whether they were plucked from an 
australian palm cockatoo a south african crowned plover or a 
caribbean coot 
criminal investigators once tapped her 46 years of expertise in 
a murder case involving a wife who shot her sleeping husband with a 
pistol wrapped in a feather pillow as a silencer 
roxie informed authorities that microscopic traces of down taken 
from the bullet lodged in the victims skull matched the feathers 
from the bulletpunctured pillow the new york times dubbed her 
miss marple of eiderdown 
roxie squints knowingly from behind her goldrimmed spectacles 
and whispers in a carolina drawl as thick as grits with ham gravy 
the fingerprint says you are it she confides feather 
evidence says you might be it the feather puts you at the scene of 
the crime 
roxies knack for unraveling the puzzles of plumage was 
discovered in 1960 when an eastern airlines turboprop hit a flock 
of starlings and crashed shortly after takeoff from boston killing 
62 people 
roxies identification of the mangled feathers scraped from the 
lockheed electras engines led to studies for the federal aviation 
administration and major aircraft engine manufacturers on designing 
safer birdproof planes 
a smithsonian research associate she roams the country 
testifying as an expert witness for the us fish and wildlife 
service against poachers smugglers of endangered birds and traders 
who sell contraband indian headdresses containing eagle feathers 
roxie also trained doug deedrick to become the fbi crime 
laboratorys expert on feather identification we met when he was 
specializing in hairs and fibers she said i asked him would 
you like to learn about feathers give me a call and come to my 
skinning class 
roxies admirers include james parrish a research ornithologist 
at brigham young university in provo utah who once sent roxie the 
bits and pieces of prey remains from a sharpshinned hawks nest in 
alabama 
she identified every one of them yellowbilled cuckoo 
northern mockingbird downy woodpecker and mourning dove parrish 
said shes the best shes irreplaceable i dont know anyone 
else in the world who can identify feather remains like she can 
kenneth goddard chief of the fish and wildlife services 
forensic laboratory in oregon says roxies abilities are amazing 
she can identify birds and feathers like they were her own 
children he said she can give their height weight sex even 
eye color its fascinating 
as a child in rural farmville nc roxie spent hours exploring 
the outdoors growing up in a small town i was always interested 
in anything that creeped and crawled she said she landed her 
first job after college at the north carolina state museum of 
natural history in raleigh in 1937 
her curiosity remains undimmed she is enthralled by the 
delicate lacework of the feathers under her microscope the pronged 
nodules on the quills the pigment cells that sometimes resemble 
tiny vienna sausages 
im learning new things every day thats what makes it 
exciting she said the more i delve into my feather stuff the 
more i see that needs explaining ill never be finished 
roxie recently got her first glimpse of a rubythroated 
hummingbirds feather magnified 1500 times under the lens of her 
scanning electron microscope 
it was so exciting she said it was like finding mysef 
in the middle of a great tropical forest id never seen before 
its as much excitement as id ever need

a gallery director who goes on trial for 
exhibiting sexually explicit photos by robert mapplethorpe fears 
artistic expression will lose even if he and his museum are cleared 
of obscenity 
other arts institutions see what the contemporary arts center 
had to go through to prove itself innocent of the charges said 
director dennis barrie i honestly do believe a lot of people 
wont do what they believe in as a result of this 
art authorities and experts in constitutional law have said they 
expect the gallery ultimately to be cleared even if it loses the 
trial set to begin sept 24 in hamilton county municipal court 
the real impact will come if a prosecutor elsewhere follows 
cincinnatis lead said floyd abrams a new york city lawyer who 
defends first amendment cases 
one more indictment by one more prosecutor let alone two 
convictions would change the entire picture for museums 
nationwide he said i think a lot rides on the result of the 
cincinnati prosecution 
the gallery is the first ever indicted on obscenity charges 
they stem from a sixweek 175item of mapplethorpes photos seven 
of which led to the charges 
the photos which include homosexual and sadomasochistic images 
stirred debate last year over federal funding of art the national 
endowment for the arts which had supported mapplethorpes works 
adopted a requirement that grant recipients pledge not to use money 
for works that might be considered obscene sen jesse helms 
rnc had pressed for the policy 
barrie faces up to a year in jail and 2000 in fines the 
gallery faces 10000 in fines 
the hamilton county prosecutors office said it is dutybound to 
enforce ohios obscenity laws if theres a criminal violation 
we have to look into it its that simple said spokesman chip 
gerhardt 
to say nothing about it would be a form of acceptance we 
dont want that the people dont want that said monty lobb jr 
president of citizens concerned for community values in cincinnati 
it has denounced mapplethorpes photos 
the case against barrie and the gallery is just one of a series 
of challenges this year to art works 
in april federal agents in san francisco seized photographer 
jock sturges pictures of naturists the man who processed the 
film faces child pornography charges and a federal grand jury is 
investigating sturges 
in july a federal prosecutor in maine dropped a court fight to 
destroy a 1962 photograph of a nude father and son by photographer 
walter chappell the picture was seized from a traveler crossing 
the canadian border 
in august a los angeles lawyer who calls himself a devout 
christian filed a lawsuit over a government grant to a photo 
exhibit by david wojnarowicz the lawyer said the exhibit depicted 
jesus christ as an intravenous drug user 
on sept 5 a boston court rejected a request by the 
conservative american family association to file obscenity charges 
against the institute for contemporary art where the mapplethorpe 
exhibit opened aug 1 
the contemporary arts center has spent 95000 on legal bills 
and budgeted 100000 more for legal costs in the fiscal year that 
began sept 7 
the gallerys legal defense fund has received grants from the j 
roderick macarthur foundation and the nathan cummings foundation 
the rockefeller foundation has given 50000 to replace money that 
was spent on legal costs

israel wants more money and weapons from the 
united states so it can keep up with the massive arms sales to 
saudi arabia planned by the bush administration 
israeli defense minister moshe arens planned to deliver that 
message to defense secretary dick cheney and congressional leaders 
today 
the administration is preparing to ask congress to approve the 
sale of 18 billion worth of planes tanks and other weapons to 
saudi arabia over the next few years sources say 
israel has not been consulted about the deal arens said in a 
speech sunday to a conference of the washington institute for near 
east studies 
i hope there will be discussions with us because im sure that 
there cannot be anybody in washington that does not feel that that 
kind of an arms deal would have an effect on israel that couldnt 
be positive arens told the gathering at wye plantation md 
and we would have to have discussions to see what could be 
done that will provide the necessary equilibrium he added 
technically israel and saudi arabia are in a state of war 
although the two sides have not fought directly since 1948 the 
saudis fund the palestine liberation organization and others among 
israels enemies 
the united states has for years supplied israel with sufficient 
weapons to maintain a qualitative edge over the far larger armies 
of its hostile arab neighbors 
but in recent years the united states has eroded israels 
advantage by selling the arabs everything it sells israel arens 
said as a result israel relies increasingly on its homegrown 
defense industry 
israeli sources say israel will ask for an increase in the 18 
billion the united states gives israel annually in defense aid the 
increase would be used to help israel develop and produce new 
weapons 
arens also wants answers on a shopping list israel gave the 
administration several weeks ago including f15 and f16 fighter 
jets and a leasing arrangement for usmade patriot antimissile 
missiles said the sources 
one of the thorniest issues on arens agenda is israels desire 
for direct access to us spy satellites orbiting over the arab 
world the sources say 
the united states has balked at giving israel raw satellite 
photos so israel may ask instead for processed pictures or any 
other intelligence information the united states is willing to 
provide the sources said 
arens warned that the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait and the 
resulting arms sales to the saudis and other us allies were 
escalating the arms race in the mideast and destabilizing the 
region 
he said israel would be willing to discuss a halt of the arms 
flow into the area if its arab enemies did the same 
we dont have the resources to compete with saudi arms 
acquisitions and those of other oilrich arab states arens said

sort of like dropkicking a wounded butterfly 
so let us be charitable this time and say that sundays edition 
of network televisions annual backpat festival was tolerable 
efficient and ran only 14 minutes beyond its allotted three hours 
on the fox network 
it offered one funny animated guestpresenting bit by foxs 
the simpsons a lovely but too short tribute to the late jim 
henson and speeches that generally were brief and to the point 
there also was one surprise it was that david lynchs quirky 
twin peaks so loudly hailed by those who can spell postmodern 
got no emmy in the major categories 
it must be that hollywood looked at ratings of the abc series 
and decided its time to be derriere garde 
with three hosts candice bergen of murphy brown who won a 
bestactress emmy jay leno and nbc news jane pauley sundays 
ceremonies from the tiny republic of pasadena were akin to last 
years effort dull but painless 
the specially made simpsons clip in the shows first hour 
was nifty though the goggleeyed clan was on hand to present 
through the magic of animation the award for best actor in a 
comedy series 
little bart simpson who wanted the honor that ted danson of 
cheers finally won tore up the envelope and scattered the 
pieces lisa his good little sister tried to make the best of 
things 
members of the creative community she said this could be 
a blessing in disguise a chance to do away with winner and 
loser 
if members of the blacktie audience felt that competition 
should be a thing of the past and all the other winning envelopes 
torn up she said then stand up and applaud 
everyone remained seated nobody applauded and you wonder why 
television gives you shows like thirtysomething 
sundays heresyourstatue festival was put together by some tv 
veterans including executive producer martin starger andcowriter 
buz kohan 
their labors yielded an evening that was professional and crisp 
enough but it was oddly short on showbiz flash 
jay leno normally sharp recycled a few saddam hussein jokes 
and seemed to be saving the good stuff for christmas 
jane pauley resplendent in a reddish satin jacket seemed out 
of place she just smiled introduced presenters then withdrew 
there were no lavish production numbers no impassioned pleas to 
save the brazilian rain forest the whales or even 2 live crew 
although doublewinner tracey ullman was merry and showed 
welcome signs of life the proceedings generally were so sedate 
that mtvs downtown julie brown wore a black derby 
oh well things could have been worse they could have broadcast 
the awards for all 78 categories including outstanding 
achievement in hairstyling for a miniseries or a special

the mysterious deaths of three young 
american indians in 18 months have produced no arrests and some 
indians think they know why 
if three young white college students two of whose parents 
were professors had been killed or died in similar circumstances 
do you think theyd have taken the same attitude asked don 
bread father of one victim and law instructor at haskell indian 
junior college here from my side of the fence id say no 
when christopher bread became the third young indian to be found 
dead recently indians wondered if a killer wasnt targeting them 
there are about 3000 indians in this fastgrowing city of 56000 
the fear has waned but the citys indians still contend police 
were too quick to discount foul play because two of the three 
victims had bloodalcohol levels above the legal limit evoking the 
stereotype of the drunken indian 
police and sheriffs officials dispute the charge they say they 
investigated the deaths fully and found no connections but continue 
to chase leads 
the body of john sandoval a 19yearold navajo from canoncito 
nm was found in april 1989 in the kansas river he had been 
missing since november 1988 and his body was so decomposed the 
coroner couldnt pinpoint a cause of death 
cecil dawes jr 21 a former west point cadet whose father 
teaches at haskell was found in october 1989 floating in river 
weeds he had been missing for 10 days 
dawes had left a bar and got his car stuck on railroad tracks 
his young companion told investigators he told her to hide and she 
then heard voices but she has changed her story investigators 
say 
the coroners report said dawes was presumed drowned his 
bloodalcohol level was 18 above the legal limit of 10 
although he wont rule out the possibility sheriff loren 
anderson said hed be surprised if a link between the deaths ever 
appeared he said there is no evidence the victims were murdered or 
died the same way 
indian leaders say their complaint was never with anderson most 
of their anger is directed at the towns police chief who they say 
scoffed at their fears during a meeting after dawes died 
police chief ron olin has said in the past that he thinks 
indians overreacted to the deaths he no longer gives interviews 
because of what his spokesman calls inaccurate information in 
newspaper stories 
the spokesman chris mulvenon attributed the indians anger to 
a personality conflict 
bread and others disputed that 
he made a strong case that cecil dawes was a bad person that 
all we have here is a drunken indian who went and fell in the 
river bread said he tried to condemn him more than anything 
else 
christopher bread was found with a fractured skull along a rural 
road outside of town in early march he had spent the night at a 
building where two heavy metal bands were playing 
investigators originally suspected the 19yearold had been hit 
with a blunt instrument then dragged to the site where he was 
found by a motorist anderson said 
but two of three autopsies ordered in the case concluded bread 
died in a hitandrun accident as he walked along the road late at 
night his bloodalcohol level was nearly 13 
im still not totally convinced that our first impression was 
wrong anderson said 
breads shirt was rolled up under his arms as if hed been 
dragged by the feet anderson said the autopsy said he had scrapes 
on his back plus a gruesome wound on one leg where the skin had 
been stripped there were no skid marks or shattered glass the 
sheriff said 
there had to be someone else around there at the time and 
that person might eventually come forward he said but in the 
other two cases well the river doesnt talk

a young roofer says he and his wife 
havent gone on vacation in three years and rarely go out a civil 
engineer says he cant save money and a jeweler says his business 
is just making a living 
they all blame high interest rates prime minister margaret 
thatchers chosen tool for squeezing inflation out of the economy 
mrs thatchers policy has yet to pay off on friday the 
government announced that retail prices were up 106 percent in 
august compared with a year ago the highest rate of inflation 
since 1982 
maidstone a town of 140000 residents about 40 miles southeast 
of london is in the heart of kent countys prosperous commuter 
country unemployment is below 4 percent and a 647acre business 
park at kings hill in maidstone is one of the largest economic 
development projects in the county 
however the region has not been spared the economic pressures 
squeezing the rest of the country the kent economic development 
board says inquiries from businesses have dropped 13 percent since 
last year 
for some individuals the economic trends add up to a crisis 
a lot of people who had stretched themselves before can no 
longer cope said mavis firth project leader at maidstones 
money advice center we cant see all the people who ask for our 
help 
the centers load of new cases has increased more than 50 
percent and theres a sixweek waiting list she said 
it can take people years to get back on the 
straightandnarrow again mrs firth said 
nick kember 28 a selfemployed roofer and his 26yearold 
wife joanne bought a home in 1987 when the mortgage rate was 985 
percent now the rates are 15 percent and he says it doesnt help 
that construction and business in general are slowing down 
its so tight really he said 
geoffrey pettitt a 49yearold civil engineer said his monthly 
mortgage payment of about 510 is a third higher than it was a year 
ago and has more than offset the increase in his salary 
at least they still have their homes 
more than 14000 homes were repossessed in britain in the first 
half of this year double the number in the last half of 1989 
according to the council of mortgage lenders 
mrs thatcher has been especially proud of the increasing rate 
of home ownership in britain under her leadership and newspaper 
pictures of evicted families are bad news for a government facing 
an election by mid1992 
not only are interest rates high said council spokesman adrian 
coles but unemployment is creeping up from 57 percent in july to 
58 percent in august retail sales were down 16 percent in the 
same period 
the institute of directors said nearly threequarters of the 200 
members surveyed in august said they were less optimistic about the 
economy and company prospects than six months ago an increase of 
27 percentage points since june 
the accounting firm touche ross and co says 2365 businesses 
failed in britain between january and august compared with 866 
over the same period a year ago manufacturing retailing and 
construction businesses were the most frequent casualties it said 
chancellor of the exchequer john major said friday that the 
government is committed to its policy of high interest rates the 
rates will remain high until its safe to lower them he said 
economic growth is expected to shrink to 12 percent this year 
from 21 percent in 1989 and 47 percent in 1988 says the london 
investment firm james capel and co 
john banham director general of the employers group the 
confederation of british industry said businessmen do not 
question the need to tackle the inflationary malaise but a 
fullscale recession is not the answer 
lawrence curtis a partner in the anthony w peake jewelry store 
in maidstone said sales have been good but profits have been pared 
by rising mortgage costs on the shop premises 
its a difference between making a living and making a 
profit he said

the big 1990 corn crop may provide a strong 
boost to the nations livestock industry the ranchers farmers 
and feedlot operators who turn out beef and pork for consumers 
according to agriculture department economists the price of 
corn is going to be substantially less than they had forecast a 
month ago that will mean some easing of feed costs from what had 
been expected 
but lower corn prices will mean lower profits for farmers who 
produce grain for sale on the market 
a lot of it may be whose ox is getting gored said leland 
southard of the departments economic research service its 
going to be positive i think for livestock 
last week usda estimated this falls corn harvest at 812 
billion bushels up 3 percent from prospects a month earlier and 8 
percent more than last years crop 
projections on supply and demand for corn during the 199091 
marketing year that began sept 1 point to total use including 
domestic and export demand of about 47 billion bushels up from 
45 billion in 198990 
it is also 100 million bushels more than the agency forecast in 
august that would be used in the coming year 
as a result of the bumper harvest corn yields per acre were 
estimated at a record high of 1217 bushels prices at the farm 
are expected to decline to a range of 210 to 250 per bushel in 
199091 
that would be down 25 cents a bushel from the august forecast 
and probably below the average 198990 price of 238 per bushel 
southard in a telephone interview a day after the sept 12 crop 
report said he had previously forecast a 3 percent increase in 
pork production next year but that uncertainty still clouded the 
plans of producers 
i would certainly expect a little more expansion now that 
the 1990 corn crop is shaping up so large he said 
farmers and ranchers who have cowcalf operations which form 
the foundation of the nations beef industry may settle on a 
more active herd expansion because of the general outlook and 
particularly the prospect of moderating feed costs southard said 
in the short run that tends to take away from beef 
production but then increases it in the longer run he said 
that is because beef cattle have a much longer biological cycle 
than hogs and poultry thus when heifers are retained for breeding 
herds it means fewer animals for the slaughter market and less 
beef 
eventually the calves produced by the heifers will grow up and 
be added to the nations beef output

rising food costs lower rebates for infant 
formula and more poor people mean congress will have to provide 
more money than originally anticipated to fully fund the women and 
infant feeding program says the congressional budget office 
the wic program never has been funded sufficiently to cover all 
the eligible women and babies but it was generally believed that 
to do so would cost about 150 million more each year the house 
has appropriated a total of 232 billion for fiscal 1991 
the cbo estimates that 285 million more would be needed to get 
participation to 85 percent which is considered full funding for 
many years participation has been about 50 percent of those 
eligible 
the budget office estimates the following increments would be 
needed for future years 319 million for 1992 358 million 1993 
400 million 1994 446 million 1995 
the wic program provides monthly food packages or food vouchers 
to lowincome women infants and children whose health is at risk 
because of poor nutrition pregnant women breast feeding mothers 
babies and children under five whose family income is less than 
specific poverty guidelines are eligible 
cbo estimates that there will 87 million eligible people in 
1991 wic is an agriculture department program administered by the 
states

the agriculture department says the tiny 
island republic of malta offers an opportunity for enterprising 
food exporters nothing huge mind you malta is less than twice 
the size of the district of columbia 
but the mediterranean island produces only 40 percent of the 
food needs for its 350000 inhabitants and thriving tourist trade 
only about 9 million worth of us products were imported last 
year says a report in the october issue of agexporter magazine 
still maltese importers have expressed a keen interest in 
buying a wide variety of us agricultural products 
these include packaged rice popcorn peanut butter dried 
fruits walnuts inshell peanuts breakfast cereals soybean meal 
and alfalfa 
however according to us agricultural officer stan m cohen 
who is stationed in milan italy taking advantage of this 
interest may require some flexibility on the part of exporters 
for example many of the maltese orders are for such small 
quantities that they will not fill up a standard 20foot shipping 
container thus requiring the shipment of mixed containers the 
report said 
also since there is no direct shipping service between the 
united sates and malta cargoes must be routed through north 
european ports meaning a transit time of six to eight week

many israelis are praising the weekend meeting 
of two cabinet ministers with mikhail s gorbachev as opening new 
horizons of diplomacy and trade but some question moscows 
motives 
it changes our international map said gideon raphael a 
veteran israeli diplomat 
he witnessed the departure from israel of the soviets and their 
east bloc satellites 23 years ago and hes now happily watching 
them trickle back 
the soviet leader met for 2 hours saturday in moscow with 
israeli finance minister yitzhak modai and science minister yuval 
neeman 
it was the highestlevel encounter ever between soviets and 
israelis and the most significant since moscow severed diplomatic 
ties with jerusalem in june 1967 
at an airport news conference in tel aviv on sunday the two 
ministers said they were carrying a personal message from the 
soviet president to prime minister yitzhak shamir they did not 
describe its contents 
they disclosed little of their talks with gorbachev but said 
they focused on the persian gulf crisis and possible trade deals 
including agriculture and oil 
the meeting was hailed by some israeli foreign policy analysts 
raphael said the soviets had over the years plunged israel into 
a diplomatic no mans land that stretched from the berlin wall to 
the chinese wall they had armed the arabs equated zionism with 
nazism and persecuted soviet jews who wished to emigrate 
now this no mans land has become smaller he said in an 
interview 
commented the daily newspaper haaretz had anyone dared a year 
ago to prophesy what would happen this weekend in moscow he would 
have brought nothing but mockery upon himself it shows that no 
political situation however unchangeable it looks exists 
forever 
saturdays meeting was unannounced beforehand modai and neeman 
left without fanfare sidestepping protocol their visit was 
arranged by a soviet jewish immigrant ilya zemtsov an aide to 
eeman 
modai said sunday that the talks with gorbachev covered wide 
possibilities of imports and exports including the idea of 
building a sovietusisraeli passenger plane 
asked about a possible exchange of soviet oil for israeli 
agricultural products modai said it was a successful guess but 
at this stage only a guess 
modai said that israel faced with the prospect of absorbing 1 
million soviet jews over the next few years needed a 
breakthrough in agricultural exports 
the talks which also covered diplomatic issues came as moscow 
and jerusalem find themselves in the same camp for the first time 
since the 1950s by dint of their opposition to iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
the meeting in moscow happened to coincide with secretary of 
state james a baker iiis talks with president hafez assad of 
syria 
the soviets used to be syrias main military backer indeed it 
was that alliance that helped trigger the 1967 middle east war and 
in turn the soviets diplomatic rupture with israel 
now that soviet arms are no longer guaranteed to syria israeli 
attitudes are changing too 
however not everyone was euphoric about saturdays meeting 
sovietologist mikhail agursky of hebrew university said in an 
interview that he believes gorbachev wont last and that to bet 
on gorbachev is to bet on a dead horse 
the daily newspaper davar argued that soviet overtures to israel 
are motivated by the old antisemitic canard about jews bent on 
world domination 
they are convinced that jewish control of world and above all 
american capital can channel enterprise and investments their 
way it editorialized 
unlike east european countries the soviet union has yet to take 
what in israels view is the ultimate step reestablishing full 
diplomatic ties

jim ruvolo feels the frustration of democrats 
who thought the party had the best of the issues going into the 
1990 campaign and then saddam hussein decided to overrun kuwait 
theres this big screen between the voters and information and 
that screen is iraq said ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic 
party 
for two days democrats met in washington this weekend and tried 
to define a campaign that so far has been overshadowed by public 
interest in the persian gulf 
like their republican counterparts the democrats profess to 
lack a clear signal of what impact the middle east crisis will have 
on individual contests this fall 
the odds are that very few of the races will be decided by what 
voters are thinking about iraq but the persian gulf is making it 
far more difficult for candidates to get the attention of voters 
the savings and loan industry scandal was an issue the democrats 
thought would work for them in 1990 
people are angry said ruvolo and they blame republicans 
more than democrats for a crisis that leaves them uneasy about 
their personal savings and that appears certain to boost the 
federal deficit 
but now thats faded into the background he said 
ronald h brown the national party chairman tried to set a 
campaign tone for his party with a speech that expressed unwavering 
support for the us commitment in the persian gulf while sharply 
criticizing republican domestic policies 
brown referred to a republican recession and said bush 
wanted to push through another tax cut for the wealthiest 
americans he castigated the president for failing to develop an 
energy policy that would make the nation less dependent on middle 
east oil and said the sampl crisis was the result of seenothing 
republican justice 
but brown steered clear of other domestic issues he apparently 
felt would not work to the advantage of his partys candidates 
the democrats refused to act on a proposal to put them on record 
as flatly opposing any tax increase to help balance the budget it 
was only months ago that bush was forced to abandon that ground 
much to the distress of many republicans and brown had no desire 
to occupy it 
well accept the presidents call for tax increases said 
brown but well not go gently when he tries to cut taxes for the 
richest americans yet again 
not a word was uttered on the nomination of david souter to the 
supreme court after two days of testimony before the senate 
judiciary committee in which he refused to say whether he might 
vote to overturn the decision legalizing most abortions souter 
appears certain to win confirmation from the senate 
i have great confidence in the senate judiciary committee 
was as far as brown would go when asked about the nomination 
when pressed as to hw he would vote on the nomination brown 
gave a lawyerly answer i think id like to see the full hearing 
and make a judgment on what he said in response to questions 
no one was willing to guess what might happen in the persian 
gulf between now and election day the most anyone would speculate 
was that the situation would remain pretty much the same with 
american forces in saudi arabia and iraq hanging tough in kuwait 
i think he bush has six or eight months of goodwill on this 
thing said ruvolo beyond that he said the president might 
face growing questions as to why us troops were remaining in the 
saudi desert

here is the text of president bushs address 
to the people of iraq as released by the white house 
im here today to explain to the people of iraq why the united 
states and the world community has responded the way it has to 
iraqs occupation of kuwait my purpose is not to trade 
accusations not to escalate the war of words but to speak with 
candor about what has caused this crisis that confronts us let 
there be no misunderstanding we have no quarrel with the people of 
iraq ive said many times and i will repeat right now our only 
object is to oppose the invasion ordered by saddam hussein 
on august 2nd your leadership made its decision to invade an 
unprovoked attack on a small nation that posed no threat to your 
own kuwait was the victim iraq the aggressor 
and the world met iraqs invasion with a chorus of condemnation 
unanimous resolutions in the united nations twentyseven states 
rich and poor arab muslim asian and african have answered the 
call of saudi arabia and free kuwait and sent forces to the gulf 
region to defend against iraq for the first time in history 13 
states of the arab league representing 80 percent of the arab 
nation have condemned a brother arab state today opposed by 
world opinion iraq stands isolated and alone 
i do not believe that you the people of iraq want war youve 
borne untold suffering and hardship during eight long years of war 
with iran a war that touched the life of every single iraqi 
citizen a war that took the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
young men the bright promise of an entire generation no one knows 
better than you the incalculable costs of war the ultimate cost 
when a nations vast potential and vital energies are consumed by 
conflict no one knows what iaq might be today what prosperity 
and peace you might enjoy had your leaders not plunged you into 
war 
now once again iraq finds itself on the brink of war once 
again the same iraqi leadership has miscalculated once again the 
iraqi people face tragedy 
saddam hussein has told you that iraqi troops were invited into 
kuwait thats not true in fact in the face of far superior 
force the people of kuwait are bravely resisting this occupation 
your own returning soldiers will tell you the kuwaitis are fighting 
valiantly in any way they can 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between 
iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world when 
president gorbachev and i met at helsinki we agreed that no 
peaceful international order is possible if larger states can 
devour their neighbors never before has world opinion been so 
solidly united against aggression 
nor until the invasion of kuwait has the united states been 
opposed to iraq in the past the united states has helped iraq 
import billions of dollars worth of food and other commodities and 
the war with iran would not have ended two years ago without us 
support and sponsorship in the united nations 
saddam hussein tells you the occupation of kuwait will benefit 
the poorer nations of the world in fact the occupation of kuwait 
is helping no one and is now hurting you the iraqi people and 
countless others of the worlds poor instead of acquiring new oil 
wells by annexing kuwait this misguided act of aggression will 
cost iraq over 20 billion a year in lost oil revenues because of 
iraqs aggression hundreds of thousands of innocent foreign 
workers are fleeing kuwait and iraq they are stranded on iraqs 
borders without shelter without food without medicine with no 
way home these refugees are suffering and this is shameful 
but even worse others are being held hostage in iraq and 
kuwait hostage taking punishes the innocent and separates 
families it is barbaric it will not work and it will not affect 
my ability to make tough decisions 
i do not want to add to the suffering of the people of iraq the 
united nations has put binding sanctions in place not to punish 
the iraqi people but as a peaceful means to convince your 
leadership to withdraw from kuwait that decision is in the hands 
of saddam hussein 
the pain you now experience is a direct result of the path your 
leadership has chosen when iraq returns to the path of peace when 
iraqi troops withdraw from kuwait when that countrys rightful 
government is restored when all foreigners held against their will 
are released then and then alone will the world end the 
sanctions 
perhaps your leaders do not appreciate the strength of the 
forces united against them let me say clearly there is no way 
iraq can win ultimately iraq must withdraw from kuwait 
no one not the american people not this president wants 
war but there are times when a country when all countries who 
value the principles of sovereignty and independence must stand 
against aggression as americans were slow to raise our hand in 
anger and eager to explore every peaceful means of settling our 
disputes but when we have exhausted every alternative when 
conflict is thrust upon us there is no nation on earth with 
greater resolve or stronger steadiness of purpose 
the actions of your leadership have put iraq at odds with the 
world community but while those actions have brought us to the 
brink of conflict war is not inevitable it is still possible to 
bring this crisis to a peaceful end 
when we stand with kuwait against aggression we stand for a 
principle well understood in the arab world let me quote the words 
of one arab leader saddam hussein himself an arab country does 
not have the right to occupy another arab country god forbid if 
iraq should deviate from the right path we would want arabs to 
send their armies to put things right if iraq should become 
intoxicated by its power and move to overwhelm another arab state 
the arabs would be right to deploy their armies to check it 
those are the words of your leader saddam hussein spoken on 
nov 28 1988 in a speech to arab lawyers today two years later 
saddam has invaded and occupied a member of the united nations and 
the arab league the world will not allow this aggression to stand 
iraq must get out of kuwait for the sake of principle for the 
sake of peace and for the sake of the iraqi people

the childless couple and the young 
woman struck a bargain mark and crispina calvert would give anna 
johnson 10000 and she would bear a child created from their egg 
and sperm 
the deal went wrong now just weeks before the birth the 
calverts and ms johnson are locked in a bitter custody dispute 
that is moving from the tv talk show arena into the courtroom 
lawyers for the three sides the fetus has a courtappointed 
attorney are preparing their strategies in a case called 
unprecedented even in the cuttingedge realm of surrogate 
pregnancies 
the issues what makes a parent the genetic link or the act of 
bearing a child and what is the legality of the surrogate 
contract 
the outcome experts say could be a groundbreaking ruling or a 
narrow decision that doesnt go beyond that of any other custody 
case a pretrial hearing is set for thursday in superior court 
harold laflamme the fetus attorney said his goal is to avoid 
protracted litigation and an unstable life for the child a narrow 
ruling based on the childs best interests is possible he said 
california courts try to avoid constitutional disputes try to 
fit cases into the family law scheme of things he said 
h joseph gitlin head of the surrogacy committee of the 
american bar associations family law section agreed that the 
childs interests may outweigh other issues but if ms johnson is 
found to lack a genetic link to the child that surely gives the 
calverts a leg up he said 
californias liberal track record in family law giving the 
nation such concepts as nofault divorce makes it more likely 
that the surrogate contract will be upheld gitlin said 
but even if the contract is ruled invalid i see the court 
deciding the case on the same basis as the baby m case that is in 
the best interests of the child he said 
in that landmark new jersey case the child was conceived by a 
surrogate mother mary beth whitehead with the sperm of a man 
whose wife couldnt have a baby whitehead reneged on the 
arrangement prompting a bitter custody fight that was won in 1988 
by the father william stern and his wife elizabeth the judge 
ruled the contract invalid and awarded them the baby 
however in that case ms whitehead was genetically the childs 
mother because she provided the egg in the california case the 
calverts agreed to provide both sperm and egg for a socalled 
testtube baby 
complicating the california case is a claim from ms johnsons 
attorneys that the fetus might be her natural child and because 
one of ms johnsons grandparents is american indian the childs 
adoption could involve federal tribalprotection laws that give 
preference to indians calvert 34 is white and his wife filipino 
mrs calvert 36 and ms johnson 29 met at the santa ana 
hospital where both worked as nurses ms johnson agreed to undergo 
an embryo transplant for the calverts for 10000 
mrs calvert was unable to conceive a child naturally because of 
a hysterectomy a single parent with a 3yearold daughter ms 
johnson said she had seen the contract as a way to put herself 
through graduate nursing school 
but ms johnson claims the couples enthusiasm for the pregnancy 
turned to indifference they were late with payments and showed no 
concern when she suffered complications she is seeking custody 
child support and emotional damages 
the calverts deny the allegations accusing ms johnson of greed 
and publicityseeking the dispute has been aired by both sides on 
such tv shows as geraldo and donahue 
the couples attorney christian van deusen said he will ask 
the court to enforce the custody rights detailed in the contract 
and to recognize the genetic relationship in determining 
parenthood 
ms johnsons attorneys richard gilbert and diane marlowe say 
they will seek to have the contract declared illegal and invalid 
because it constitutes babyselling california has no law on the 
issue 
they maintain that ms johnson is the biological parent because 
she is carrying the child to term and that the transplant may not 
have even succeeded state law recognizes the birth mother as the 
legal mother they say

kuwaitis fleeing through a suddenly 
opened border crossing say food is becoming scarcer in their 
homeland and iraqi soldiers are trying to quell resistance by 
blowing up blocks of houses 
their governmentinexile called the unannounced weekend exodus 
of several thousand kuwaitis the first allowed by iraq in about a 
month evidence that iraqs saddam hussein intends to depopulate 
kuwait and move in his own people 
one refugee the 45yearold owner of an investment company 
said people are not obeying them the iraqis so they want to get 
rid of us 
iraqi soldiers confiscated all identity documents including car 
registrations from those leaving the oilrich emirate refugees 
said they said the iraqis apparently wanted to make it difficult 
for anyone to return 
no precise tally was available on the number of refugees who had 
crossed into saudi arabia at khafji since word spread in kuwait on 
friday that iraq was lifting restrictions on departure through the 
border post the only official crossing between the countries 
in addition to the several thousand kuwaitis who apparently made 
the journey refugees included a yugoslav woman maried to a 
kuwaiti and about 20 asians saudi officials said 
they said they were too overwhelmed with paperwork to give exact 
figures 
the iraqis had not announced the border opening the refugees 
learned of it by word of mouth and could only speculate on the 
reasoning behind it 
the kuwaiti cabinet discussed the development in an emergency 
meeting sunday in the southwestern resort of taif where the 
governmentinexile has established its headquarters 
afterward it issued a statement saying the border opening 
reflected a new iraqi policy of getting the kuwaitis out after 
stripping them of their identity papers and bringing in iraqis to 
settle in kuwait 
kuwaiti leaders have previously accused saddam of intending to 
eventually repopulate kuwait with iraqis 
on sunday mercedes chevrolet suburban jeeps and scores of 
other expensive cars stretched 500 yards from the checkpoint as 
saudi border police checked vehicles and demanded some 
identification 
theres just too many of them to handle its a very slow 
procedure getting them through because they have no documents 
said a western diplomat stationed at the border to monitor the 
traffic 
a committee of kuwaitis at the border screened refugees asking 
questions about such things as membership in local organizations 
saudi officials have expressed concern the iraqis opened the border 
to sneak in spies and terrorists 
some refugees said they had received news of the border opening 
in anonymous telephone calls 
a 33yearold journalist said a friend got a call saying why 
do you always talk badly about saddam hussein the borders open 
why dont you leave 
like many fleeing he was afraid to give his name for fear that 
the iraqis might harm relatives left behind 
its a rough life now the journalist said theyre 
blowing up houses killing people for any suspicion 
kuwaitis said the iraqis have blown up or burned up to 20 houses 
at a time in neighborhoods where iraqi soldiers were killed by 
resistance fighters 
the iraqis also were sealing off whole neighborhoods to conduct 
housetohouse searches looking for resistance material and the 
several hundred westerners still reported in hiding the refugees 
said 
they said the sound of gunfire could be heard during the curfew 
hours of 11 pm to 7 am 
saddams troops have plundered most public property carting 
off everything from hospital machinery to street lights but have 
generally stayed out of kuwaiti homes 
now they want to make a super robbery in kuwait take 
everything said 35yearold salam matouk another refugee 
an estimated 300000 of kuwaits native population of 570000 
have fled since iraq invaded on aug 2 most are in saudi arabia 
where the government pays for their housing and food 
only kuwaitis working in essential services like electricity and 
water plants are at their jobs refugees reported kuwaits police 
officers have ignored an order to return to work and no one has 
registered for the announced oct 1 opening of schools 
stocks of food are getting low and cash short the refugees 
said 
but staples are still available and small quantities of 
vegetables are brought in by palestinian traders allowed to go to 
iraqs southern port city of basra they said 
the refugees bitterly criticized the palestinians thousands of 
whom work as professionals or merchants in kuwait for 
collaborating with iraqi authorities to root out former soldiers 
and policemen 
many palestinians in jordan and elsewhere have supported iraq in 
its occupation of kuwait

angered by iraqi raids on the french and 
other diplomatic compounds in kuwait un representatives say 
theyre considering extending to air corridors the international 
embargo on trade with iraq 
on sunday the security council unanimously passed a resolution 
condemning iraq for violating diplomatic territory with fridays 
raids and warning that further sanctions were likely if baghdad 
continued to ignore un resolutions 
the us ambassador thomas r pickering said another 
resolution would be drafted to impose an air embargo a step the 
united nations has never taken against a nation 
an air blockade would involve the interception of planes 
approaching iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering 
hostilities than the boarding ships in the persian gulf which has 
been done under the un naval embargo 
by singling out diplomatic missions for attack iraq confirms 
its preference for instruments of force to instruments of diplomacy 
and negotiation pickering said 
western diplomats say sanctions are also planned against nations 
that break the embargo the un imposed on trade with iraq after 
saddam husseins forces invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the ambassadors of the security councils five permanent members 
the united states britain france china and the soviet union 
met at the french mission on sunday to begin laying the groundwork 
for further resolutions 
pickering and other diplomats said they expected a vote by the 
end of the week 
if iraq persists there will be other resolutions soviet 
ambassador yuliy vorontsov said the cumulative effect will 
produce the necessary result a political solution a solution 
without any kind of military activity 
president francois mittrrand of france said saturday that his 
country wants the united nations to widen the embargo on iraq to 
include air traffic and punishment of countries or companies 
violating the sanctions 
the swift move on the air embargo indicated how seriously the 
western world views iraqs storming of the french belgian dutch 
and canadian compounds the detention of diplomats and seizing of 
three frenchmen 
iraq attacked the resolution as part of a vicious hostile 
campaign led by the united states and its allies 
iraq categorically rejects that it had kidnapped foreigners 
from former diplomatic premises or is holding them as hostages a 
foreign ministry spokesman said in a report by the iraqi news 
agency 
work on the new resolutions began hours after the council in an 
emergency session sought by france voted 150 early sunday to 
condemn iraq for its storming of embassy compounds 
the resolution was the seventh adopted overwhelmingly by the 
council to deal with the crisis sparked by iraqs lightning 
invasion and annexation of the oilrich emirate 
the four embassies raided were among some 17 that have remained 
open in kuwait in defiance of an iraqi order to close iraq cut 
utilities to many embassies and surrounded missions with troops to 
force diplomats to leave 
the iraqi government considers kuwait a province of iraq and 
says the 1961 vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular 
relations do not apply those treaties set forth the inviolability 
of diplomatic compounds 
in its latest resolution the council said it strongly 
condemns aggressive acts perpetrated by iraq against diplomatic 
premises and personnel in kuwait as well as the abduction of 
foreign nationals who were present in those premises 
it demanded the immediate release of all foreign nationals 
although iraq has allowed western women and children to leave 
many men have been sent to strategic sites to serve as shields 
against potential attack by usled forces 
an air embargo would require cooperation from iraqs neighbors 
they would have to close their air space to iraqbound flights 
refuse refueling to planes headed for iraq and report suspicious 
flights to the security councils sanctions committee 
state department officials say privately that the few flights 
now going into baghdad are not considered a threat to the integrity 
of the embargo and that it would be impossible for iraq to 
effectively break the sanctions with airlifts

a toddler who was trapped for 14 hours in a 
12foot shaft at his parents new home popped out like superman 
after a firefighter crawling on his belly through a rescue tunnel 
grasped the boys hand 
twentymonthold kevin davis was released from a hospital with 
little more than a scraped elbow sunday after being treated for 
dehydration 
kevin listened to his mother sing nursery songs and busied 
himself rolling mud balls as rescuers dug a parallel hole to the 
shaft and then tunneled over to the boy who had fallen in on 
saturday afternoon 
i could hear him crying but i couldnt touch him and i 
couldnt help him said his mother lisa davis fighting back 
tears at a news conference at denver general hospital it was 
really difficult 
kevin fell to the bottom of the shaft dug for a remodeling 
project at the home the family was not living there at the time 
he managed to slip under a piece of wood and fell into the hole 
i heard him bouncing around mrs davis said 
lying on their stomachs firefighters kevin duncan and joe cipri 
used their hands to dig the last few feet of the second tunnel 
before reaching the boy shortly after 6 am sunday 
cipri said when he placed his hands near kevin the toddlers 
little hands just grabbed my fingers he just kind of flew out of 
there like superman 
firefighters worked through the night to keep kevin warm and 
dry pumping oxygen into the hole and shining halogen lights to 
keep the temperature at about 70 degrees 
workers dug a vertical rescue shaft using a huge truckmounted 
pipeline excavator that uses a stream of compressed air to chisel 
away dirt and clay and then vacuums out the loose dirt 
he was in a daze his diaper hanging off just kind of looking 
at us like whats happening here duncan said when he 
clinched my fingers i felt a tingle in my heart its still 
there 
after kevin was safe cipri said i just laid there for awhile 
in that tunnel enjoying the roar outside it was just great this 
is what you get on the fire department for 
hospital spokeswoman mary lee chin said kevin had only a scrape 
on his elbow 
the boys father tom davis admitted he had not obtained the 
necessary building permits for work being done at the home no

for 37 million in 1988 to kalikow

8565 percent up from fridays 8460 percent close their price 
fell to 8119 points from 8162 
the market expects that earnings of many companies for the

lech walesa who a decade ago led polish 
workers in forming the east blocs first free trade union 
announced today that he will run for president of poland 
today i made up my mind i am putting forward for societys 
approval my readiness to be a candidate for the post of president 
of the polish republic in popular elections the solidarity 
chairman said in a statement from the unions headquarters in the 
baltic port of gdansk 
for me it is a fulfillment of the pledge i made in august 
1980 said walesa he was catapulted to fame that month by a 
leading role in strikes that spurred the government to recognize 
the solidarity labor federation 
walesa a skilled negotiatior also played a key role in the 
spring of 1989 in the talks that led communist authorities to 
eventually hand over power to prosolidarity forces 
the 46yearold electrician at the gdansk shipyard where 
solidarity was born is at odds with his former allies now running 
polands government he has suggested for nearly a year that he 
might run 
postcommunist polands first fully democratic presidential and 
parliament elections are expected as early as this fall and no 
later than spring 
supporters of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the former 
close adviser walesa picked to be the east blocs first 
noncommunist government leader want mazowiecki to run for 
president mazowiecki has not said whether he would run and his 
office said today there would be no immediate response to walesas 
decision 
the countrys current president gen wojciech jaruzelski is 
polands former communist leader and ordered a 1981 military 
crackdown that attempted to crush solidarity 
jaruzelski said through a spokesman today that walesas 
presidential bid reflects the process of democratic changes in 
poland 
jaruzelski was elected by parliament last year as part of the 
political compromise that gave prosolidarity forces control of the 
government 
walesa has charged that too many supporters of the old communist 
administration remain in key posts and that the government is 
losing touch with the problems of poland 
two camps the beginning of a multiparty system after four 
decades of communist control have emerged in the political feud 
one the center alliance supports walesa for president and is 
identified with workers and the solidarity union in gdansk 
the other known by the acronym road backs mazowiecki and is 
associated with intellectuals and the government in warsaw road 
organizers have called on mazowiecki to make his decision by the 
end of september 
walesa predicted last week that he would win he said that 
mazowiecki would receive 35 percent of the vote if he ran 
i am not worried about victory but about its scale walesa 
said the situation is hard and if the president is elected with 
only 50 percent of the vote he will have to work 48 hours a day 
thus he must win with 80 percent 
jaruzelski has said he will resign early from his sixyear term 
as president he was elected in july 1989 largely to smooth 
relations with the soviet union after historic accords between 
solidarity and thencommunist authorities paved the way for the 
democratic transformation of poland and other eastern european 
states 
polands powerful roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp 
has called together the leaders of the countrys political factions 
for a meeting tuesday to discuss the next stage of the nations 
democratic development 
parliament is scheduled to begin debate thursday on a schedule 
for elections

newspapers today derided president bush for 
warning in a broadcast message to iraqis that saddam hussein was 
steering them toward war one declared mr bush we listened to 
your message but please shut up 
bushs speech to the iraqi people touched off street protests 
sunday in baghdad iraqs capital thousands of iraqis marched and 
shouted death to bush death to america 
in a move consolidating control of kuwait authorities announced 
today that iraq has ordered the dissolution of kuwait airways that 
countrys flagship air carrier 
iraqi authorities allowed bushs eightminute speech to be 
broadcast apparently in its entirety on sunday evening iraq had 
offered bush television time after us officials complained of the 
air time given saddam the iraqi leader by western media 
in the message with an arabic voiceover and subtitles from the 
us government bush warned that iraq was internationally isolated 
and on the brink of war he said saddam had miscalculated and 
should withdraw from kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
said bush standing in front of his white house desk with the 
american flag behind him 
in a 25minute rebuttal sunday after bushs message iraqi 
authorities responded with a statement on iraqi tv saying his 
speech was full of lies and contradictions 
should war be imposed on us the iraqi people will not 
hesitate in joining to teach the aggressor an important lesson 
the announcer said 
today the governmentowned newspaper aljumhuriya or the 
republic published a frontpage commentary headlined the 
illusions of mr bush 
once again the president of the united states fails to 
understand the mentality and psychology of the iraqi people it 
said instead of correcting his previous mistakes bush wants to 
push the area to the abyss of untold catastrophes 
the arablanguage newspaper said bush is the victim of his own 
hatred for iraq and its leaders it defended saddam sayingif 
other people see the sun shining from the eastern horizon iraqis 
see it shining in the face of saddam hussein 
another commentary in aljumhuriya headlined shut up mr 
bush said america today is a bastion of oppression and we have 
this to say mr bush we listened to your message but please 
shut up 
the iraqi army newspaper alqadissiyah also taunted bush saying 
his message was empty and avoided the issues 
it is evident that bush who is the president of a state which 
claims the leadership of the world has failed in his first test 
with the iraqi people alqadissiyah said 
it also questioned bushs claim to represent world opinion 
the paper declared that bush wants to say that he has a 
mandate to carry out his aggression against iraq but we know that 
the decision to go to war with iraq is purely american 
the semiindependent newspaper iraq ran a pageone headline 
bush tricks it said bushs message was evidence of how the 
united states is moving toward confrontation with iraq and the arab 
and islamic nations 
it reveals the arrogance of the united states which wants to 
impose itself as regent on the international community the paper 
said president bushs message was full of lies forgery and 
contradictions 
sundays demonstration began with a few hundred men who gathered 
in the streets of baghad as they marched through residential 
neighborhoods thousands of others including women and children 
joined them 
in addition to denouncing bush they called egyptian president 
hosni mubarak and king fahd of saudi arabia traitors of the arab 
world for backing the usled multinational troop buildup that 
began in response to iraqs seizure of oilrich kuwait 
the dissolution of kuwait airlines was announced today in a 
presidential decree published in alqadissiyah it said all assets 
were transferred to the governmentrun iraqi airways

her husband to be released unharmed he had been on sick leave for

president mikhail s gorbachev assailed for 
indecision on overhauling the economy called today for a national 
referendum on whether to end the collectivization of farmland and 
return it to individuals 
it apparently would be the first national referendum ever 
conducted in the soviet union and gorbachevs proposal reflects 
the deep split in opinion about how to rescue the economy 
he spoke a day after 50000 protesters marched to the kremlin 
and demanded the resignation of gorbachev and his prime minister 
over the state of the economy which is plagued by 
underproductivity and worsening consumer shortages that have 
included bread lines in moscow this month 
the demonstrators carried banners reading the economy is a 
disaster 
in a 30minute address to the national parliament today 
gorbachev said the fate of farmland is too big a decision 
comrades to be made in offices auditoriums or meeting halls 
even as important as the one in which we are working today 
the parliament or supreme soviet was opening debate on 
competing economic reform plans 
last week gorbachev endorsed a plan that would move the soviet 
union toward a market economy in 500 days it would include 
allowing farmers and other private citizens the right to own and 
sell land and pass it to their heirs 
so far soviet reforms have stopped short of full privatization 
of land in part because of staunch opposition from traditional 
communists land was collectivized in a bloody 192932 campaign 
under josef stalin leaving a legacy of fear and distrust among 
farmers 
several competing reform plans have been proposed including a 
radical version backed by russian republic president boris yeltsin 
and approved by the republics legislature russia is the largest 
of the 15 soviet republics with half the countrys people and 
threefourths of its land mass 
the national prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov last week 
proposed a more moderate plan that would only partially dismantle 
the state planning bureaucracy 
in his address today gorbachev stopped short of advocating any 
specific proposals it was not immediately clear how strongly he 
supports the proposal to decollectivize land 
the question of whether there should be private ownership of 
land or not is the sovereign right of the people to decide and it 
can be decided only by a referendum thats my point of view he 
said 
gorbachev called privatization of land the most difficult 
issue in devising plans for reform he also emphasized the need 
for political stability a tack he has taken in the past to counter 
calls for the resignation of ryzhkov and other national leaders 
reshuffling the top echelons of power would draw us into 
grim political battles and would heighten confrontation in 
society at a time when we most badly need consolidation to carry 
out the market economy program and to draft a new federal treaty 
gorbachev said 
his remarks appeared designed in part to calm fears among 
communist party members and other elements of soviet society 
opposed to moving to a market economy 
he said that no matter which proposal is adopted the government 
should protect the population from the negative aspects of a market 
economy such as inflation unemployment and possible sharp rises 
in the costs of basics like health services and housing 
we need to guarantee soviet citizens a basic wage pensions 
housing and free medical care he said 
ryzhkov in a television interview saturday said he feared that 
a 500day transition to a market economy would cause widespread 
suffering his more conservative reform program would keep central 
planning through 1991 
after gorbachev addressed parliament economist stanislav 
shatalin told lawmakers he opposed the proposed referendum saying 
it would take at least six months and delay the reforms 
if all our lives we make the heavy decisions by referendum 
then were not truly taking responsibility its not the way 
politicians should talk he said shatalin helped draft the 
economic plan backed by yeltsin 
gorbachev interrupted shatalins remarks to stress that he was 
not in favor of referenda on a wide range of subjects but only 
on the matter of land the land on which we live 
the situation was clouded further when deputy prime minister 
leonid abalkin told lawmakers that the 542member supreme soviet 
lacked the legal authority to schedule a referendum on 
decollectivization as implied by gorbachev 
abalkin said the only body with the constitutional power to 
order a referendum was the congress of peoples deputies the 
2250member body that elects the legislature and the president 
gorbachev sat expressionless during abalkins remarks

the army chief of staff says israel will not 
automatically respond in kind to an iraqi invasion of jordan 
signaling an easing of israels stand on the gulf crisis 
the comment by lt gen dan shomron reported today by israeli 
newspapers followed suggestions that an iraqi invasion of jordan 
could be aimed at drawing israel into the gulf conflict as a way of 
uniting arab nations behind iraq 
shomrons statements appeared to back away from defense minister 
moshe arens warnings that israel would act immediately if iraq 
invaded jordan arens has made the statement repeatedly since 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
shomron said that by placing such a red line israel did not 
mean that its an automatic system that if an iraqi soldier 
steps on it an electric circuit will close and an entire military 
system will be put into action newspapers said 
shomron was quoted as saying that if iraqi troops entered 
jordan israel would first examine which troops went in and would 
study the possible impact of any israeli response 
however shomron also said israels air force military 
intelligence and civil defense units were on heightened alert 
because of jordans closeness to iraq and to radical palestinian 
guerrilla groups that support sadam hussein 
the haaretz daily said shomron also disclosed in a briefing 
with israeli military reporters that prime minister yitzhak shamir 
has secretly agreed to increase the defense budget to confront the 
new middle east buildup 
an unidentified military source was quoted as estimating the 
increase as an additional 205 million the present budget allots 
about 5 billion to defense 
reports on shomrons briefing said the chief of staff was 
concerned by the protracted us standoff with iraq and repeated 
warnings by iraqi leaders that israel could come under attack if 
war breaks out 
israel is also worried by jordan king husseins fencemending 
last weekend with radical palestinian guerrilla leaders george 
habash and nayef hawatmeh shomron reportedly said 
the two leaders are visiting jordans capital amman ending a 
20year rupture in ties with jordans king hussein according to 
the post the army feared hussein could become incapable of 
preventing the guerrillas from launching crossborder raids from 
jordan into israel 
in a related development the haaretz military correspondent 
quoted american army experts as saying iraq has recently developed 
new nerve gas warheads for groundtoground missiles 
the same experts reportedly questioned the potential accuracy of 
such missiles they also noted iraq has developed this capability 
as part of a new technological push since its invasion of kuwait 
haaretz said 
israel is particularly nervous about iraqs chemical arms 
capability since saddam has threatened to use such weapons against 
the jewish state if his country is attacked

iran and iraq have halted a monthlong 
prisoner of war exchange during which some 75000 pows were 
repatriated but both sides still hold many prisoners a red cross 
official said today 
there was no explanation from either side the prisoners had 
been seized during the 198088 persian gulf war and their release 
had been a sign of the warming relations between the two nations 
an official of the international committee of the red cross said 
in a telephone interview from geneva that it was not immediately 
known how many prisoners had yet to be repatriated 
but the red cross which is coordinating the exchange has 
estimated that some 100000 prisoners were held by both sides 
before the exchange began 
the move came as an iranian delegation headed by deputy foreign 
minister manouchehr mottaki met in baghdad with an iraqi team led 
by foreign undersecretary wisam alzahawi to discuss normalization 
of ties between the former gulf war foes 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia reported sunday that 
repatriation of the prisoners which began aug 17 after iraqi 
president saddam hussein gave in to iranian territorial demands 
over their shared border was abruptly halted sunday without any 
explanation from baghdad 
reports from iraq confirmed that no iraqi prisoners had been 
repatriated since sunday either 
the prisoners who still have to be exchanged are those whom the 
red cross had been unable to register 
internationally isolated after his aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
saddam last month made peace with iran 
he initiated the prisoner exchange agreed to shared sovereignty 
over the shattalarab waterway which forms the southern border 
between the two countries and removed troops from iranian 
territory captured during the war

saudi arabia and the soviet union reached a 
preliminary agreement today to restore diplomatic relations after a 
break of more than 50 years the official tass news agency 
reported 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his saudi 
counterpart prince saud alfaisal al saud also called for the 
immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait tass said 
shevardnadze said the two nations reached a preliminary 
agreement to restore diplomatic relations and he hoped the 
question would be settled fully after the saudi minister met with 
president mikhail s gorbachev tass said 
the issue of establishing official contacts between the union 
of soviet socialist republics and saudi arabia has long been 
ripe a foreign ministry official sergei kirpichenko was quoted 
by tass as saying 
saudi arabias new rapport with moscow comes after the soviet 
union despite its long alliance with iraq broke with baghdad and 
condemned the invasion of kuwait 
saudi arabia and moscow had full diplomatic relations until 
1938 when dictator josef stalin closed his embassy in jiddah in a 
costcutting move 
several attempts to reestablish ties during the 1980s faltered 
over what saudi arabia called the soviet unions belligerent 
attitude toward its 50 million moslems 
in their discussions of the persian gulf crisis the saudi and 
soviet foreign ministers were quoted as saying both wanted a 
peaceful settlement 
we hope that faced with the world communitys unanimity iraq 
will agree to the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of its 
troops from kuwait and will restore legality tass quoted the 
saudi official as saying 
on sunday the saudi arabian minister of pilgrimage and 
endowments arrived in moscow to attend a threeday islamic 
conference and meet with soviet moslems tass said 
the visit is the first ever to be made by a religious affairs 
minister to the soviet union 
as part of the improving atmosphere between the two countries 
king fahd the saudi monarch recently donated about 16 million 
copies of the moslem holy book the koran to soviet moslems the 
soviet union allowed more than 1000 soviet moslems to make the

workers cleared it of overgrown foliage and repainted it over the 
weekend 
there were some problems and we will have to resume 
discussions tomorrow said premier hun sen of the 
vietnameseinstalled government he would not elaborate

mistrust between the soviet union and the united 
states has given way to cautious friendship former president 
ronald reagan told a soviet parliamentary committee today 
he later met with president mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan addressing the international committee of the supreme 
soviet legislature predicted gradual arms reductions by both 
superpowers in the next five years as we find new ways to work 
together on matters where our goals are similar 
we both have powerful tools of war he said neither of us 
wants to use them however we can use the knowledge about hem to 
help blunt or head off regional conflicts or reckless acts of 
renegades 
together our great size can be used in the service of all 
humankind to persuade those whose passions have reached the danger 
point to cool down again he said speaking from a podium beneath 
a portrait of karl marx 
reagan singled out soviet cooperation in countering iraqs 
invasion of kuwait as an example of our mutual understanding for 
the need to prevent the spread of conflict in a volatile region of 
the world 
reagan and his wife nancy arrived in moscow on sunday the 
second day of a fiveday visit 
reagans talks with gorbachev today were closed to the media 
reagan is scheduled to meet tuesday with students at moscow state 
university 
referring to efforts by the soviet government to hammer out a 
new federal structure with its 15 ethnically diverse republics 
reagan appealed for reason to prevail over passion 
as you find a reformulation of the relationships in your 
union you will find there is a period of uncertainty and 
tension he said differences can be resolved in ways that are 
fair to all but reason must prevail over passion if there is to be 
a climate conducive to the settlement of disagreements 
thirteen republics have declared independence or sovereignty 
defined as republican laws having precedence over national laws 
when men and women are free to express themselves and do so 
in large numbers as is happening in your land today a consensus 
will emerge over time on major issues reagan told about 50 
lawmakers gathered around a long conference table 
the reagans on a 10day european tour spent sunday in 
leningrad touring the citys cathedrals and the hermitage museum

in response two ghanaian fighter bombers went into action 
sunday looking for and neutralizing artillery emplacements the 
british broadcasting corp quoted a west african task force 
spokesman as saying 
nigeria meanwhile sent 650 more soldiers to join its 
1000member contingent in the force the soldiers were flown 
sunday from lagos to freetown sierra leone where they were to 
board ships for monrovia a nigerian government statement said 
a rebel radio broadcast said three aircraft bombed robertsfield 
international airport and charged that the united states was 
involved a spokesman for the us embassy in monrovia denied any 
american planes took part in the alleged raid

nearly 5000 public school teachers went on 
strike today over 400000 worth of health benefits the first 
walkout in new orleans schools since 1978 
union president nat lacour said the orleans parish school 
boards refusal to bend on health benefits that demand triggered 
the strike he reinstated earlier demands that had been dropped 
during bargaining for a 45 million package that includes pay 
raises for the systems teachers plus 1100 teachers aides and 
school secretaries 
the school board insisted that classes would continue almost as 
usual for more than 84000 pupils with substitute teachers and 
administrators replacing teachers who refused to cross picket 
lines 
parents of some emotionally disturbed or educationally 
handicapped children were told that classes for their children 
would be canceled 
pickets were out before dawn their signs bearing messages such 
as no raise no work school buses rolled past the chanting 
pickets half empty parents walked with their children to the 
schools then stood about in small knots talking quietly 
were not striking just for money were looking for 
professional respect said katy hall a sixthgrade teacher at 
lafayette elementary school where the picket line went up more 
than two hours before classes were to open 
lacour president of the united teachers of new orleans gave 
strike orders sunday in a blistering speech that laid the blame on 
what he called the school boards poor spending habits and 
inflexibility 
its a strike over economic justice lacour said 
the teachers scaled back over the weekend to demanding 1 
million in additional health benefits the school board turned them 
down and stuck to the 600000 it had on the table 
we cannot give what we do not have said frank fudesco the 
boards chief negotiator he appealed to teachers to weigh 
loyalty to union against loyalty to students 
the teachers who receive pay from both the school system and 
the state have already received a 7 percent wage increase from the 
state this year salaries range from 19455 for a starting teacher 
to 35111 for someone with a doctorate and 25 years of experience 
about 650 teachers aides who make about 10000 a year would 
get raises of 4 percent to 5 percent under union demands as would 
450 clerical workers who make about 17000 
in his speech lacour complained that school administrators 
drive new cars while schools go without soap and toilet paper he 
also criticized superintendent everett williams 102700 a year 
salary which lacour said is comparable to the pay in larger 
cities 
administrators have dismissed the unions complaints and say 
their spending has been appropriate 
with the boards refusal to agree to the union demands teachers 
said they will circulate recall petitions against all school board 
members in addition after the strike broke out the union 
reverted to its original demands for 10 percent raises each year of 
a threeyear contract 
the board has raised teachers salaries twice since 1983 but 
lacour said the increases have been eroded by rising health 
insurance and retirement costs 
the union also is seeking collective bargaining rights for about 
100 psychologists and other employees who evaluate students for 
special education services

about 200 northwest loggers and community 
leaders rallied on capitol hill today asking for compassion for 
mill workers and families who may be hurt by 
environmentalistbacked plans to slow timber harvests 
the social havoc and human suffering being caused in the 
northwest is a concern for everyone said valerie johnson leader 
of the oregon lands coalition 
the push for protection of the regions oldgrowth forests has 
intensified since the us fish and wildlife service declared in 
june that one of its inhabitants the northern spotted owl is a 
threatened species 
the preservationist agenda has become more clear to us as we 
learn what is happening in other parts of the nation farmers 
fishermen miners we are all being told that americans dont need 
us any more ms johnson said 
the coalition is one of the groups making up the northwest 
citizens lobby which plans to lobby each member of congress this 
week in an effort to stir up opposition to proposals that would ban 
logging across millions of acres of northwest forests 
environmentalists planned their own lobbying blitz this week 
after about 500 demonstrators rallied at the capitol on sunday to 
protest a series of bills they say would further reduce the 
shrinking supply of the nations oldgrowth forests 
the timber industry lobby has a national agenda as they grab 
the wealth of public lands operating from a national power base in 
congress said mark winstein of save americas forests an 
organization that sponsored the demonstration 
we didnt come to washington to ask congress for a handout we 
came to ask for the opportunity to continue working said doug 
robertson a county commissioner from roseburg ore participating 
in the oregon lands coalition rally 
all patriotic americans must join forces to create a new power 
base that will represent our desire for a healthy environment 
said winstein whose coalition speaks for more than 30 
organizations representing nearly 150000 members in 18 states 
at todays rally evelyn badger presented rep denny smith 
rore with 40000 petition signatures from northwest families 
the petition asks congress to consider the social and economic 
impacts on families and communities as it weighs scientific 
evidence concerning preservation plans for the northwests forests 
theres a war waging across this nation and resourcedependent 
people are losing ms badger said the challenge now is to 
convince federal lawmakers to weigh both the scientific evidence 
and the social price tag 
smith who is seeking reelection and has been targeted by 
environmentalists as an enemy said the northwest residents face an 
uphill battle

the sixth and final fuel compartment on a 
burning gasoline tanker exploded this morning the day after the 
first in a series of blasts and fire injured 17 crew members 
authorities said 
one crewman who apparently tried to swim for shore was missing 
the blazing 392foot hulk burned through the night casting an 
orange glow across the saginaw river 
none of the cargo of 1 million gallons of gasoline had spilled 
into the river from the doublehulled tanker but coast guard 
officials feared the hull might melt or break because of the 
intense heat spreading flaming fuel into the water 
officials decided this morning to use a coast guard cutter 
along with oil rig fire specialists from texas to spray the tanker 
from bow to stern with fireretarding foam then they would wait 24 
hours before trying to move the ship 
the mv jupiter a tanker owned by cleveland tankers inc 
erupted in flames sunday morning while moored at a pier 
it had pumped about 30000 barrels of its 54000barrel cargo 
into a pipeline leading to storage tanks ashore said dan lacey 
spokesman for ashland oil inc parent company of cleveland 
tankers 
ronald stopyak who had returned home 15 minutes before the 
blast from working at a chemical plant across the river from the 
tanker said he raced back to work after hearing the explosion 
i thought the plant exploded and when i got out there i saw 
black smoke everywhere he said i saw the employees on the 
ship go overboard it was really hot i could feel the heat from 
across the river 
state environmental officials undertook water and air pollution 
tests said spokeswoman susan henry a gasoline spill is less 
damaging than an oil spill because gasoline evaporates easily 
gov james blanchard visited the site and declared an emergency 
to free up state aid and assistance 
henry said ashland had set up booms to contain any spill coast 
guard crews secured the tanker with cables to prevent it from 
drifting into a bridge 
the missing crewman was identified as tom sexton 46 of cedar 
falls iowa other crewmen said sexton tried to swim for shore 
after the explosion but apparently didnt make it 
bay medical center spokesman curt miller said 17 crew members 
were treated there and three were admitted two had head injuries 
and a third suffered chest pains he said 
bay city is a town of 40000 on lake hurons saginaw bay about

federal prosecutors said today they will not 
retry mayor marion barry on a dozen drug and perjury charges a jury 
could not resolve im obviously relieved the mayor said 
the governments decision came five weeks after barry was 
convicted of one misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and 
acquitted on another jurors deadlocked on the 12 remaining perjury 
and drug charges and us district judge thomas penfield jackson 
declared a mistrial on those counts 
jackson set oct 26 as the sentencing date for the possession 
charge the mayor faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and 
a 100000 fine 
at the sentencing hearing prosecutors will make a formal motion 
for dismissal of the unsettled charges jackson is expected to 
grant the request 
assistant us attorney judith retchin told the judge today 
the government has made a determination not to seek retrial on 
the pending counts 
barry smiled broadly when retchin announced the governments 
decision 
im obviously relieved at this phase of the legal 
proceedings barry said afterward he declined further comment 
us attorney jay b stephens told reporters that even if barry 
were convicted on some of the remaining charges the potential 
sentence would not be significantly longer than what he already 
faces 
a retrial would achieve little more than what has already been 
accomplished stephens said 
when all the dust has settled in the final analysis the 
ultimate truth remains that the chief executive of this city 
charged with leading the fight against illegal drugs and violence 
has himself been convicted of contributing to that human 
devastation stephens said 
what has been achieved here really is substantial and a 
retrial would not contribute substantially more to that result in 
terms of the public record of the evidence stephens said 
the prosecutor denied that political considerations including 
barrys pretrial decision not to run for reelection entered into 
his choice 
mr barrys political status and political future are not 
factors we considered when making decisions about this 
prosecution stephens said 
a week after the jurys aug 10 verdict barry announced he 
would run as an independent for a seat on the city council he had 
ruled out seeking a fourth fouryear term as mayor before his trial 
began 
after the jurys verdict barry urged federal prosecutors to 
abandon any thought of retrying him saying now is the time for 
healing let their judgment be our last judgment 
the jurys decision followed a dramatic eightweek trial in 
which the jurors and the world watched videotape of barry 
smoking crack cocaine the night he was arrested in an fbi sting 
operation at a downtown hotel room 
earlier this month the us attorney for the virgin islands 
terry halperin announced that she would not bring charges against 
the mayor there 
one of the felony perjury charges and the conspiracy charge 
barry faced involved alleged drug activity in the virgin islands 
during 1986 and 1988

the israeli government decided today not to seek 
an extension of a court injunction that banned publication of a 
book by a former intelligence agent 
the decision means the book by way of deception by victor 
ostrovsky could be on canadian bookstore shelves by the end of the 
month a spokesman for stoddart publishing of toronto said 
the israeli government won the 10day injunction sept 7 it 
argued that release of the book would endanger the lives of its 
agents 
the harm we were seeking to prevent has already occurred 
joel goldenberg a lawyer for the israeli government told the 
general division of ontario court 
he was referring to a new york appellate court decision thursday 
allowing the book by ostrovsky a former mossad agent and 
canadian journalist claire hoy to be published by st martins 
press 
without the american decision it would have been a tough 
battle but i think its one we would have won said gordon wood 
lawyer for stoddart ostrovsky and hoy 
a day after the new york decision bookstores were swamped with 
requests for the book those that had copies sold out almost 
immediately 
st martins had already shipped 17000 copies of the book to 
1500 stores and reviewers before israel obtained a temporary order 
from a state supreme court justice barring sales

a libyan delegate at a conference of arab 
radicals called today for suicide attacks on us forces in the 
persian gulf and saudi arabia 
ibrahim alkharraz a member of the libyan peoples congress 
said arabs should follow the example of the suicide bombers who 
blew up the marine barracks in beirut in 1983 killing 241 marines 
we have the striking examples of heroes who turned their 
bodies into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to 
flee in darkness as happened to the american marines in beirut 
said alkharraz 
the cheers and enthusiastic applause from delegates to the 
conference of arab leftists islamic party members and palestinian 
guerrilla factions underscored the depth of antiamerican feeling 
among arab radicals 
the palestine liberation organization has come out on the side 
of iraq during the crisis but in stockholm today a senior plo 
official was quoted as saying iraq must leave kuwait and a solution 
to the crisis should not be delayed by the israelipalestinian 
issue 
the plo has called for an international conference to settle the 
gulf crisis and deal with israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip 
but the first step must be that iraq leaves kuwait we do not 
demand that the two issues be linked nabil shaath an aide to 
plo chief yasser arafat was quoted as telling the swedish national 
news agency tt 
we have been hurt by the saying that plo is on the side of 
iraq but this is not true we demand that iraq leave kuwait 
shaath said 
the delegates at the jordan conference also cheered when adnan 
saududdin a member of the jordanian islamic front and the 
fundamentalist moslem brotherhood called for an islamic uprising 
to topple egyptian president hosni mubarak 
saududdin said moslems should rise up against mubarak and free 
egypt from the shackles of the treasonous campdavid accords 
the threeday conference also got a lift when the democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine said in a statement that king 
hussein met today with its leader nayef hawatmeh there was no one 
immediately available at the kings press office or the information 
minstry to confirm the report 
hawatmeh had been banned from jordan for 20 years after the 
black september war in 1970 between palestinian guerrillas and 
the kings forces however hawatmeh and george habash the leader 
of the popular front for the liberation of palestine who also was 
banned for 20 years returned to jordan last week for the 
conference 
hawatmehs palestinian guerrilla faction said that the king and 
hawatmeh talked at length about the gulf crisis and middle east 
problems

american troops sweltering in saudi 
arabia might be allowed to take their rest and recreation in 
foreign cities on private beaches or on cruise ships us 
officials say 
the need for some kind of holiday system has become apparent 
with the realization that us military forces are likely to be in 
the desert at least until early 1991 and probably longer 
at the same time officials concede there are special problems 
in finding ways to let american soldiers relax in saudi arabia a 
strictly conservative moslem society where they cannot mix casually 
with the local population or the opposite sex 
moreover the sheer size of the american force likely to reach 
200000plus within a few weeks could have a severe impact on 
nearby smaller persian gulf states such as bahrain and dubai 
where alcohol is available and the lifestyle is somewhat more 
westernized 
gen h norman schwarzkopf commander of us forces in 
operation desert shield said in an interview that he envisioned an 
rampr system similar to that provided for american troops in vietnam 
two decades ago 
those soldiers were allowed one weeks leave a year with the 
roundtrip air fare paid to any one of several places including 
hong kong australia singapore taiwan bangkok and hawaii 
id hope we could have the same sort of platter of selection 
available here schwarzkopf said 
but he added were still in the process of brainstorming 
this whole routine were a long way from having any firm plan 
for rampr 
one obstacle is that defense department regulations permit 
governmentpaid leaves only for soldiers in areas where there is 
hostile fire he said 
i know theyre looking at that and a lot of other things he 
said noting that another pentagon regulation already has been 
changed to give saudi arabiabased troops free mail privileges 
usually permitted only in combat zones 
a key concern in finding suitable recreation centers was the 
threat of iraqiinspired terrorist attacks schwarzkopf said 
im not going to set up another beirut barracks to get blown 
up he said referring to the 1983 bombing of a us marine 
barracks in beirut in which 241 servicemen were killed were 
certainly factoring that into it 
if a vietnamstyle rampr is approved possible sites might include 
cairo and vacation spots in europe such as the usowned military 
ski resort and recreation center in garmisch west germany 
schwarzkopf said another proposal was for a couple of cruise 
ships where they can relax and dance and have music and air 
conditioning and swimming pools and just sort of live it up 
schwarzkopf said however that this was an idea only as 
was another suggestion for a private beach somewhere that could 
serve american troops without their numbers having too much impact 
on the local population 
the two most logical rampr sites in the region are bahrain just 
across a 12mile causeway from saudi arabia and dubai the major 
port of the united arab emirates near the southeastern end of the 
persian gulf 
both are accustomed to us navy personnel in relatively small 
numbers and civilian clothes but they could have difficulty coping 
with an influx of military people looking for fun 
schwarzkopf said there had been no agreements no formal 
contacts with those countries but he said he could imagine 
some entrepreneurial bahrainis who wouldnt mind setting up a 
hotel at some location that wouldnt interfere with bahraini 
life 
in addition to planning for outofcountry rampr officers are 
setting up centers with airconditioned tents showers and 
television where troops can gain a few days respite from the 
desert 
schwarzkopf acknowledged that while the military faced a 
shortage of videotapes it also had to deal with the saudis 
ban on any sexually oriented materials 
its their law just as we have customs regulations that dont 
allow outsiders to bring certain things into the united states 
he said 
so if they deem it objectionable and confiscate it thats ok 
im sure there are plenty of other videotapes out there that will 
not be deemed objectionable

the entire population of chidester 
about 345 people was evacuated this morning when a union pacific

britain expelled eight staff members from the 
iraqi embassy and ordered the deportation of 23 other iraqi 
citizens today in what foreign secretary douglas hurd called a 
gesture of solidarity with european allies 
the action came as the 12 european community nations decided to 
expel military attaches and restrict the movements of other 
diplomats to protest iraqi raids last week on european embassy 
compounds in kuwait 
the foreign office said that two military attaches and six 
support staff were being expelled from the iraqi embassy in 
retaliation for the iraqi intrusions 
the home office later announced that 23 iraqi nationals were 
being deported for reasons of national security the names and 
occupations of those people were not disclosed 
hurd announced the action against the diplomatic staff in 
brussels belgium where he was attending a meeting of european 
community foreign ministers 
this all arises because i feel the government feels that 
weve got to act in solidarity with the french and the other 
countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out 
during the last few days hurd said in an interview relayed to 
london by the governments information office 
a reporter asked hurd if there was a danger that new sanctions 
could worsen the crisis 
there is always a danger hurd said but there is also a 
danger of letting these things happen and accepting them as if they 
were tolerable they are not tolerable 
just as we have taken action against the iraqis over their 
treatment of hostages in general so we have taken action in this 
respect hurd said 
on friday iraqi troops stormed the residence of the french 
ambassador in kuwait city seizing four french citizens including 
a military attache the attache was later released but the 
whereabouts of the other three remained unknown 
dutch belgian and canadian diplomatic compounds in kuwait also 
were raided last week by iraqi troops the embassy raids were 
unanimously condemned sunday by the un security council 
france announced the ispatch of 4000 additional troops to the 
persian gulf region and expelled 29 iraqis in retaliation italy 
announced it was ousting all officials at the iraqi military 
attaches office in rome 
in paris iraqs ambassador today accused french authorities of 
maltreating military trainees who were expelled from france over 
the weekend pressed to give examples ambassador abdul razzak 
alhashimi told a news conference that some of the iraqis were 
shoved 
france and britain are among more than a dozen nations 
including the united states which have refused iraqi orders to 
remove their diplomats from kuwait 
hurd complained about the treatment of diplomats in the besieged 
country 
they are surrounded by soldiers they cant get food or drink 
in they cant get oil in their position is gradually getting 
worse theyve been blockaded since the end of august 
so all the western embassies are in the same boat the iraqis 
have taken one step further and we have to react accordingly he 
said 
hurd said there was support among the ec ministers for an air 
blockade of iraq but he said it was important to obtain backing 
from the un security council for such a move as was done for the 
naval blockade

two young gunners stood in front of the 
twin beige behemoths that will be their metallic camels of the 
desert m1a1 battle tanks dubbed hound dog and hollywood 
being inspected for duty in saudi arabia 
i love tanks confesses spec 5 joseph barajas of modesto 
calif i cant wait to get there start gettin those t72s in 
my sights 
barajas and his sergeant michael duda of glendale calif were 
as eager to show off their tanks as if they were their shiny new 
sports cars 
right now were focusing all our attention on getting 
maintenance of the vehicles to make sure theyre ready duda 
said there was a flurry of activity around the two tanks as dudas 
unit prepared to leave this capital of tankdom the largest center 
of armored weaponry in the free world 
we just got back from calfax training thats the best were 
really ready to go duda said of a training exercise his unit had 
just undergone 
duda and barajas armored machines are designed to ferret out 
and destroy their soviet counterpart the t72 in use by 
president saddam husseins heavily mechanized iraqi divisions 
the 67ton tanks are revered by their crews because they can 
keep a target in sight while the 1500 horsepower turbine engine 
moves flat out at 42 mph with the tanks laser range finders 
ballistic computer thermalimaging night site and wind sensors 
the gunners can see through darkness fog and dust to blast the 
insides out of any armored opponent 
such a love of tanks inspired barajas to volunteer for duty in 
saudi arabia and turn down a transfer to the lush green hills of 
bamberg west germany 
i couldnt go to germany and leave these guys go off without 
me barajas explained this is what ive been training all my 
time in the army for 
the 25yearold soldier said hed sent his wife and three 
children back home to be with family while he was away but 
goodbyes werent easy 
my oldest son hes five he said to me daddy dont worry 
you wont die he said can you believe that 
asked whether any of the soldiers in the unit were afraid of 
what they might encounter barajas said a few had admitted to such 
qualms over some barbecue and beers the night before 
but youd be crazy if you didnt feel a little bit of that

the official press mocked president bushs 
broadcast message to the iraqi people saying monday that he 
failed in his first test to convince them that saddam hussein 
was to blame for the persian gulf crisis 
one baghdad newspaper commenting on bushs eightminute message 
broadcast nationally sunday evening said mr bush please 
shut up 
althawra the official newspaper of the ruling baath party 
said iraq its leader and the arab nation are but one state with 
one will a will having a firm determination to score victory and 
purge the land of arabs from any presence offending their 
sovereignty and dignity 
in his videotaped message recorded at the white house and with 
arab subtitles and and an arab voiceover bush said saddam 
hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle between iraq and 
america in fact it is iraq against the world 
the iraqi army newspaper alqadissiyah replied monday that it 
is evident that bush who is the president of a state which claims 
the leadership of the world has failed in his first test with the 
iraqi people 
althawra said the speech was an attempt to distort facts and 
reverse the true nature of the conflict under cover of 
international legitimacy 
if washington prepares for a military action against iraq the 
iraqis backed by all arabs moslems and honorable citizens all 
around the world are quite ready to defend their land sovereignty 
and rights althawra said 
bush is the direct enemy whose forces were desecrating mecca 
and the tomb of the prophet in a futile effort to threaten iraq 
it said 
other newspapers joined the chorus ridiculing bush for saying 
president saddam hussein was pushing the country toward a war 
one also printed a presidential decree formally dissolving the 
kuwait airways corp the flagship air carrier of the emirate 
saddam invaded aug 2 and then annexed 
bushs speech triggered antiamerican demonstrations in the 
streets of baghdad with thousands marching and chanting death 
to bush death to america 
in a frontpage commentary headlined the illusions of mr 
bush the state daily aljumhuriya said once again the 
president of the united states fails to understand the mentality 
and psychology of the iraqi people 
instead of correcting his previous mistakes bush wants to 
push the conflict to the abyss of untold catastrophes 
another article in the newspaper headlined shut up mr 
bush said america today is a bastion of oppression and we have 
this to say mr bush we listened to your message but please 
shut up 
alqadissiyah said bush was playing a new game of 
ciainspired psychological warfare it challenged bushs claim that 
he spoke on behalf of the international community 
by that we understand that bush wants to say that he has a 
mandate to carry out his aggression against iraq the paper said 
but we know that the decision to go to war with iraq is purely 
american 
alqadissiyah published a decree by saddam that formally 
dissolved kuwait airways and transferred all its assets to the 
governmentrun iraqi airways the decree also dissolved all kuwait 
airways offices abroad and dismissed its personnel 
several kuwait airways planes have already been moved to baghdad 
and repainted in the green and white colors of iraqi airways 
kuwaiti authorities in exile managed to salvage some of kuwait 
airways 22 aircraft and have set up a new headquarters for the 
airline in cairo

a woman who says she fussed at my 
husband every time he bought some tickets was among the winners 
to step forward today and claim their share of a record 1065 
million jackpot 
six florida lottery tickets matched the winning numbers drawn 
saturday night after a week of feverish buying some of it by 
people who drove or flew in from out of state or plunked down 
thousands of dollars trying to improve their odds from 1 in 14 
million two of the winners appeared at a news conference this 
morning 
jeanne piasecki of new smyrna beach said her family was 
splitting the winnings she added smilingly i still dont 
believe in gambling i fussed at my husband every time he bought 
some tickets 
another winning ticket holder pat landry of sorrento in lake 
county said her winning entry bought by her daughter in longwood 
was divided among a dozen family members and friends 
she said she was glad their were six grand prize winners because 
it helped keep the attention on her family to a minimum 
who needs 106 million she commented 
both ticket winners said the numbers were picked at random 
the jackpot estimated at 105 million sunday was calculated 
today at 1065 million a state record and second largest in us 
history each of the six tickets is thus worth 1775 million over 
20 years or about 887500 a year before taxes 
the other four winners didnt immediately step forward lottery 
computers show the other winning tickets were bought in miami 
coconut creek venice and winter haven 
the winners matched all six numbers drawn 050621343545 
some of the umpteen million losers had plenty to say too 
i just lost miserably said victor morgan who bought two 
tickets but ive wasted my money on worse things 
jennifer kram who matched just three numbers on one of her 20 
tickets said im very depressed three isnt good enough for 
me i wanted at least 500000 the threenumber match will bring 
her a grand total of 550 
the prize had snowballed for four weeks growing with each 
weeks drawing every time no one won the jackpot only a 115 
million jackpot in pennsylvania last year has been higher but in 
that drawing 14 winning tickets were sold 
more than 100 million 1 tickets were sold at up to 44500 a 
minute 
lottery secretary rebecca paul hinted at the exhaustion the week 
had brought 
i think were glad its over she said but its been fun 
and exciting 
state economists planned to meet today to calculate how much 
extra money education will reap education like the rest of state 
government is facing a 5 percent spending cutback because of a 
shortfall in revenue 
by law half of every dollar spent on a florida lottery ticket 
is paid out in prizes at least 385 percent goes to education and 
the rest to retailers and administration 
the us record for a lottery prize to a single winner is held 
by florida which awarded a woman almost 552 million after a 
drawing two years ago

the chairman of the national endowment for the 
arts expressed hope monday that the crisis will soon pass over 
federal support for controversial art with a senate proposal to let 
the courts decide whether works are obscene 
but chairman john e frohnmayer held fast at least for a while 
longer to his muchcriticized requirement that nea grant 
recipients sign a pledge not to use federal funds to produce art 
that might be considered obscene 
even though the pledge was prompted by a congressional obscenity 
ban that will expire sept 30 frohnmayer said he will keep the 
pledge until a federal court in new york issues a ruling on its 
constitutionality and congress decides whether to impose new 
antiobscenity restrictions on the endowment 
in any case the embattled nea chairman said there was zero 
truth to rumors that he may resign in the heat of battle over 
past endowment support for works that conservative critics have 
denounced as obscene and sacrilegious 
at a news conference at the national press club frohnmayer said 
he was heartened by two events last week 
one was a report by a bipartisan study commission that backed 
the endowment opposed antiobscenity curbs and called for reforms 
in the neas grant procedures 
the other was the emergence of a senate compromise that shifts 
the burden of deciding cases of obscene art from the nea to the 
courts 
both developments frohnmayer said give us hope that the 
crisis will soon pass 
the senate bill approved 151 last week by the labor and human 
resources committee provides a wise solution to a very thorny 
problem frohnmayer said 
the measure now headed for senate floor action would allow the 
endowment to get its money back if a grant recipient is convicted 
of creating works that violate obscenity or child pornography laws 
the guilty artist would be forbidden to receive further nea grants 
for at least three years 
we await the action of congress with the hope that clear 
thinking and cool heads prevail frohnmayer said 
frohnmayer outlines several internal reforms at the federal arts 
agency to make its grant procedures more responsive to the desires 
of the taxpaying public but he conceded that his reforms wont 
satisfy those who dont want an arts endowment 
both the study commission and the national council on the arts 
the presidentially appointed advisory body to the endowment have 
urged that frohnmayer eliminate his antiobscenity pledge which 
has stirred widespread protests in the arts community 
the senate committee also is expected to suggest that the pledge 
be dropped when it issues its formal report on the bill which 
would extend the neas life for five years beyond sept 30 when 
its statutory authority expires 
also expiring that day will be a ban on nea support for works 
that may be considered obscene specifically including 
depictions of homoeroticism sadomasochism and the sexual 
exploitation of children 
congress attached the ban to the endowments current 171 
million budget last october at the urging of conservative lawmakers 
led by sen jesse helms rnc who had protested nea grants for 
exhibitions of works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano 
since frohnmayer instituted the antiobscenity pledge in 
november a dozen artists and arts organizations have forfeited nea 
grants rather than sign the pledge three lawsuits filed against 
the endowment in federal courts in new york and los angeles charge 
that the pledge violates first amendment guarantees of freedom of 
expression 
frohnmayer said monday he wont decide whether to eliminate the 
pledge until he knows what congress and the courts have to say 
about the obscene art issue in the next few weeks

ramon salcido went on trial for his 
life today 17 months after his wife two daughters and four others 
were shot or stabbed to death in a murderous rampage through 
californias wine country 
salcido admits the slayings but a jury will decide if the 
29yearold winery worker is guilty of firstdegree murder or as 
his lawyer argues was not mentally capable of such an intentional 
act 
salcido could face the gas chamber if convicted 
the prosecution argues that salcido planned and willfully 
carried out seven killings including three inlaws and a 
coworker and tried to kill three other people and therefore 
should be convicted of firstdegree murder and attempted murder 
these were coldly calculated crimes says peter bumerts 
chief deputy district attorney in sonoma county where the slayings 
occurred on april 14 1989 he planned to rely principally on 
salcidos taperecorded confession to detectives 
salcidos lawyer marteen miller planned to concede that 
salcido killed the victims and tried to kill the three survivors 
that puts at issue his state of mind he said 
miller the sonoma county public defender will argue that 
salcido was in a psychotic depression and high on cocaine and 
champagne and mentally incapable of the planning or intent 
required for a conviction of firstdegree murder 
the trial moved to san mateo county superior court because of 
intensive news coverage in sonoma is expected to last about a 
month 
salcido is charged with fatally shooting his wife angela 24 
in the couples boyes hot springs duplex and cutting the throats 
of their three young daughters and leaving them for dead at a dump 
carmina then 2 survived and told detectives dad hurt me 
he also is accused of fatally stabbing his motherinlaw marian 
richards 47 and killing two of her daughters and with shooting 
to death a coworker at the grand cru winery in glen ellen 
salcido was charged with attempted murder in the attack on 
carmina the shooting of a coworker and an attempt to shoot the 
mans wife 
if the jury convicts salcido of firstdegree murder and finds 
true the specialcircumstance allegation of multiple murder a 
second phase of the trial would be held to determine if he should 
be executed or be sentenced to life in prison without possibility 
of parole

gen mike dugan was fired as air force chief 
of staff today following the fourstar generals blunt comments 
about us contingency plans for massive air strikes against 
baghdad 
defense secretary dick cheney relieved dugan of his duties after 
consulting with president bush and then delivered a harsh critique 
of the 53yearold decorated flier 
there are certain things we never talk about we never discuss 
operational matters such as the selection of specific targets for 
potential air strikes cheney told reporters 
we never talk about the targeting of specific individuals who 
are officials in other governments that is an violation of the 
executive order the secretary said 
we never underestimate the strength of opposing forces or 
reveal previously classified information about the size or 
disposition of us forces nor do we ever demean the contributions 
of the other services he said 
gen dugans statements as reported in the press and as 
confirmed by him to me failed all of those tests cheney said 
the pentagons rare disciplinary action of a top officer came 
one day after published reports quoted dugan as saying us 
military authorities had concluded that massive air strikes are the 
only effective way of forcing iraq out of kuwait if war erupted 
dugan was on a tour of us military installations in saudi arabia 
when he made his comments in an interview with the los angeles 
times and the washington post 
atop the dugan interview in the los angeles times the paper 
quoted unnamed senior us military planners as saying that 
such an air campaign would be designed in part to decapitate 
the iraqi leadership by targeting saddam hussein his family his 
senior commanders and his palace guard 
the paper quoted dugan as saying that a better list of 
highvalue iraqi targets had been drawn up by military planners 
the paper said the list stressed the importance of attacking 
hussein and his inner circle but beyond that dugan would not 
detail any target points 
dugan still retains his fourstar rank but he is expected to 
retire 
protocol demands that he retire a pentagon source said 
theres no job in the air force he could really hold now 
dugan flew combat missions during the vietnam war and later 
taught cadet military training courses at the air force academy 
he was named assistant deputy chief of staff at air force 
headquarters in january 1987 and six months later he became air 
force deputy chief of staff for programs and resources 
dugan was promoted to the joint position of commander of us 
air forces in europe and commander of allied air forces central 
europe headquartered at ramstein air base west germany in april 
1989 
his military decorations include the distinguished service 
medal the silver star the legion of merit the distinguished 
flying cross and the purple heart 
pending the choice of gen dugans successor the vice chief of 
staff gen john michael loh will act as the top commander of the 
air force 
cheney told reporters mike dugan is a fine officer with an 
outstanding record of service in the united states air force and to 
the nation relieving him is not a pleasant task but i felt it was 
a necessary one 
cheney said there are 150000 us combat troops in the persian 
gulf 
they may be engaged in hostilities in the very near future a 
very fragile very important international coalition has been put 
together to halt saddam husseins aggression cheney said 
under those circumstances he added the conduct of us 
national security policy is an extremely delicate task he said 
dugans statement did not in my mind reveal an understanding of 
the situation or of what is expected of him as a member of the 
joint chiefs 
dugans office said he was not at work today and was unavailable 
for comment 
dugans attempts at openness a major change for top air force 
generals appeared to contribute to his undoing 
shortly after taking over from gen larry welch in july dugan 
began an aggressive campaign to meet with reporters and deal openly 
with some of the services sore points on capitol hill 
the service had been battered by congressional budget battles 
over the b2 stealth aircraft and problems with the performance of 
the f117a stealth bomber during the panama invasion 
dugan raised a few eyebrows inside the pentagon last week when 
he traveled to saudi arabia before the chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff gen colin powell had a chance to visit with the 
troops 
commanders on the ground in saudi arabia have been critical of 
dugan for several weeks because of his open assessment of us 
military capabilities 
powells aides said last week dugan was one of several people 
who have been talking too much 
saddam already has you guys giving away the store we dont 
need to help him any more one powell aide said privately 
pentagon officials said dugan appeared to be the second member 
of the joint chiefs of staff to be relieved of his duties 
in 1949 president truman relieved the chief of naval 
operations adm louis e denfeld 
truman took the action upon the recommendation of the secretary 
of the navy whod asserted that the admiral had lost control of 
his command 
denfelds dismissal according to a new york times account 
printed the day after the presidents action came two weeks after 
the admiral had complained to congress that the navy was being 
starved in order to support the air forces bombing mission

seized today by iraqi troops refugees reported and their sobbing 
wives and daughters were forced to cross into saudi arabia without 
them 
the air force chief of staff gen mike dugan was fired today 
because of his frank comments about us contingency plans for air 
strikes on baghdad 
defense secretary dick cheney said dugan violated pentagon rules 
barring discussion of the selection of targets for possible 
military strikes and revealed classified information about the 
strength of us forces in the gulf 
while touring us military sites in saudi arabia on sunday 
dugan said massive air strikes would be the only effective way to 
force iraq out of kuwait in a war he was quoted by the washington 
post and the los angeles times 
in iraq staterun newspapers today heaped scorn on president 
bush for his broadcast warning to the iraqis that their president 
saddam hussein is leading them to war one newspapers headline 
read shut up mr bush 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
bush said in his speech aired sunday on iraqi television 
standing in front of his oval office desk with the american flag 
behind him bush urged iraq to withdraw its troops from kuwait 
which it overran on aug 2 
iraqi authorities responded that bushs statement was full of 
lies and contradictions they said the us president aimed to 
be dictator of the world 
thousands of protesters gathered in the streets of baghdads 
capital after bushs broadcast chanting death to bush death to 
america 
international opposition to iraq however picked up strength 
britain said today it would expel the iraqi military attache and 
three aides from the embassy in london foreign secretary douglas 
hurd indicated the home office would be annoucing further sanctions 
against iraq later in the day 
belgium restricted the mobility of iraqs diplomatic personnel 
the dutch foreign ministry said it was summoning iraqs 
ambassador today and dutch television reported a cutback in the 
iraqi mission and restrictions of its diplomats freedom of 
movement were imminent 
the moves came after dutch french belgian and canadian 
embassies or diplomatic residences were raided last week by iraqi 
troops the embassy raids were unanimously condemned sunday by the 
un security council 
france on sunday expelled 29 iraqis in retaliation and italy 
announced it was ousting all officials at the iraqi military 
attaches office in rome 
twelve member nations of the european community meeting today 
in brussels belgium were also weighing a possible air blockade of 
iraq to enforce a un trade embargo 
everybody was arguing for an air blockade said the belgian 
foreign affairs minister mark eyskens 
the ministers were also considering new economic steps against 
iraq and more aid for countries hurt by the unordered embargo on 
trade with that counry 
un diplomats on sunday began drafting a new resolution to 
close off iraqs air routes and punish nations flouting the 
unordered embargo on trade with iraq us officials said 
an egyptian military source said egypt will send 250 soldiers to 
saudi arabia today and more will follow in a few days joining the 
estimated 4000 egyptian troops already in the region the source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said egypt would also send 
egytian tanks armored personel carriers and air defense systems to 
saudi arabia by ship across the red sea 
meanwhile japans first mission of doctors nurses and support 
staff was preparing today to leave for saudi arabia tuesday to lay 
groundwork for a planned 100member japanese medical team 
officials said japan has pledged a total of 4 billion to the 
usled multinational effort against iraq but recruitment of 
medical personnel has been slow 
moscow announced today it would restore diplomatic ties with 
saudi arabia cut in 1938 soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and his saudi counterpart prince saud alfaisal al 
saud also called for the immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops from 
kuwait the official tass news agency said 
tass quoted shevardnadze as saying the formalities of 
reestablishing ties would be finalized after the saudi minister 
met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the soviets had 
been longtime allies of baghdad but became cool to iraq after 
saddam seized kuwait 
at the lone border crossing between kuwait and saudi arabia 
about 6000 kuwaitis streamed out of their homeland over the 
weekend after iraq troops suddenly and without explanation opened 
the crossing it had been shut for a month 
but refugees arriving today said iraqi troops manning the border 
crossing were seizing all kuwaiti males between the ages of 17 and 
36 apparently because they were of age to serve in the military 
and all nonkuwaitis except for a few western women married to 
kuwaitis were turned back by the iraqis and told to leave kuwait 
through baghdad 
the kuwaiti governmentinexile called the unannounced weekend 
exodus evidence that saddam intends to depopulate kuwait and move 
in his own people 
in a move consolidating their control of kuwait iraqi 
authorities announced today that they ordered the dissolution of 
kuwait airways that countrys flagship air carrier 
there was concern that the iraqis might be trying to send spies 
or terrorists into saudi arabia where 100000 us troops have 
deployed since the invasion of kuwait leading a multinational 
force refugees without proper identity documents were being 
questioned carefully by saudi authorities 
the kuwaiti refugees told tales of terror and anarchy at home 
of dwindling food supplies and iraqi troops blowing up the homes of 
suspected resistance fighters in kuwait city 
meanwhile the flow of arab and asian refugees from the persian 
gulf region continued unabated air indias top executive said the 
airline is ferrying 3000 indians a day from the region making it 
one of the worlds largestever civil evacuations 
subhas r gupte the chairman of the stateowned airline said 
45000 indians have been flown home about 190000 indians were in 
kuwait and iraq at the time of the invasion 
bushs address to the iraqi people with an arabic voiceover 
and captions provided by the state department was apparently 
broadcast in its entirety sunday evening it was the first direct 
message from bush to the iraqi 
in a commentary today headlined shut up mr bush the iraqi 
governmentowned aljumhuriya or the republic declared america 
today is a bastion of oppression and we have this to say mr 
bush we listened to your message but please shut up 
the speech was followed immediately by a 25minute response from 
an iraqi tv announcer who said a thundering rage is building 
against the united states in the arab world and a showdown in the 
persian gulf would end in a catastrophe for us forces 
a few hundred men later took to the streets of baghdad the 
iraqi capital as they passed through residential neighborhoods 
thousands of men women and children joined them 
raising clenched fists the demonstrators denounced bush they 
also called president hosni mubarak of egypt and king fahd of saudi 
arabia traitors of the arab world for siding with the united 
states in the confrontation

a senior aide to mikhail s gorbachev said monday 
that competing reform programs now under debate are designed to 
give momentum to the transition to a market economy but will 
not fully transform the system 
nikolai petrakov meeting with the associated press board of 
directors and executives also acknowledged that soviet politics 
were in a state of crisis as oldline communists and bureaucrats 
battle reform 
president gorbachev further confused the political scene monday 
by telling parliament he wanted a referendum on one of the 
fundamental tenets of economic reform legalizing the private 
ownership of farm land and other real estate 
the parliament of the russian federation the largest republic 
in the country with more than half its people and twothirds of its 
territory already has passed a reform plan that would 
decollectivize agriculture 
the situation we have now is the situation of a government in 
crisis i really dont know how this crisis is going to be 
resolved petrakov said 
petrakov said he hoped for a compromise that would have as a 
starting point a really severe blow against monopolies 
we want to give this process momentum we certainly do not 
expect it to be completed in 500 days we need to create 
conditions for competition one of the most important conditions 
for a market economy 
but he said the reform package favored by gorbachev would not 
make the ruble convertible against western currencies 
i do not think we will be able to attain full convertibility 
within 500 days he said but he said that the package would 
include guarantees that foreign investors would be able to take 
their soviet profits outside the soviet union in the form of hard 
currencies a major incentive for attracting capital 
efforts to reform the national economy he said had been 
complicated by declarations of independence or sovereignty by 13 of 
the 15 soviet republics since march 
the process of sovereignty looks like a joke or more like a 
musical comedy he said 
most of the soviet republics have declared control over major 
state enterprises and natural resources on their territory plus 
the right to create their own central banks and issue their own 
currency 
many of the republics want to erect customs control on the 
borders between the two republics he complained 
he said economic union among the republics should be based on 
four fundamentals a single central bank a single currency the 
ability of the central government to levy taxes and maintenance of 
a single customs agency 
maintaining the economic union was crucial he said since the 
1917 bolshevik revolution the relations among suppliers and 
industries across the nation have grown to such a degree that no 
republic can live without the others 
lithuania the republic that has gone furthest in declaring its 
political independence from the soviet union has expressed 
interest in a new form of economic union he said 
the republics are prepared to waive their right for 
independent currency if we are able to create a stable monetary 
system because that is a fundamental for a sound economy he 
said 
of course it is true that an economic union would be 
voluntary any republic would be free to exist as an independent 
state and would maintain economic ties with the other republics 
like relations with the countries of eastern europe

their children are away from home 
but for the heard children the classroom is the persian gulf 
and their instruction could mean the difference between life and 
death 
since president bush ordered american troops to the middle east 
following the iraqi invasion of kuwait three of the heards 13 
sons and daughters have been caught up in the deployment

aboard the carrier independence in the persian gulf a daughter and 
her husband both in the military reserves remain in the united

from abroad so she and her husband a retired marine started 
operation something from home 
their mission is to see that every serviceman and woman involved 
in operation desert shield gets something from home 
we have read over the years how military personnel never get a 
letter never get anything mrs heard said my god these are 
our children theyre all our sons and daughters and the least we 
can do is to get something to them 
what began from humble beginnings a few dollars and a couple 
of packages a week has grown into a nationwide effort all from 
the basement of the heards manassas home boxes are everywhere 
brimming with articles from chewing gum and crackers to toilet 
tissue and paperback novels

the telephone others are assigned as shoppers who buy items to 
ship to the armed forces

estate company in the virgin islands sent a 50 check an envelope 
from an anonymous sender arrived last week with a 100 bill tucked 
inside 
aaron clark a fourthgrader from mount vernon ill created 
his own care package with a small box of cigars a roll of candy 
and a paperback novel he sent it to the heards with hopes that 
they would forward it to the troops

in a way the effort is helping heal some old hurts left by the 
vietnam war she said the homespun packages are a lifeline for 
those deployed to the persian gulf and a way to show them that they 
are being supported back home 
do you remember when our people came back from vietnam mrs 
heard asked it was no longer an honor to wear a uniform they 
were spit at and rotten vegetables were thrown at them 
i am ashamed that i was one of those americans who didnt 
stand up and do anything she said i was a coward and i did 
nothing this country in 30 years has suffered so much there just 
didnt seem to be any unity and now if you read these letters 
god bless america warts and all mrs heard said

business inventories jumped 07 percent in 
july the biggest pileup in a year while sales slumped 05 
percent the government said monday causing some apprehension over 
the amount of goods held on shelves and back lots 
although the level of inventories is not recessionary robert 
brusca chief financial economist at nikko securities co 
international inc in new york said surging stockpiles are a 
danger sign 
when inventories rise faster than sales particularly when 
sales are in a lagging mode its reasonable to assume youre going 
to see cutbacks in manufacturing output he said that could 
result in growing unemployment 
the commerce department said inventories in july totaled a 
seasonally adjusted 8019 billion up from 7965 billion in june 
it was the biggest increase since a 08 percent gain in july 1989 
the june backlog had declined a revised 05 percent from the 
previous month rather than the 04 percent originally reported 
sales meanwhile dropped to a seasonally adjusted 5395 
billion down from 5424 billion a month earlier the june sales 
also were revised to a weaker 06 percent gain rather than the 10 
percent advance first reported 
cynthia latta an economist with drimcgrawhill in lexington 
mass noted that sales rose only on the retail level in july but 
pointed out that retail sales deteriorated in august falling 06 
percent according to a commerce department report last week 
and while retail sales increased 04 percent in july the gain 
was less than half of the 11 percent jump the previous month 
retail sales represent about half of all consumer spending which 
itself accounts for twothirds of the nations economic activity 
the combination of falling sales and rising inventories produced 
a 149 ratio of inventories to sales up from 147 in june and the 
same as mays 149 the ratio means it would take 149 months to 
exhaust the backlog of goods at the july sales pace 
neither brusca nor ms latta believe the ratio is dangerously 
high 
but with evidence that retail selling is weak and that output 
is falling to have inventories building is not a good sign for the 
economy brusca said 
all major business categories experienced gains in inventories 
manufacturing backlogs were up 07 percent to 3733 billion 
wholesalers posted a 05 percent gain to 1922 billion retailers 
registered a 08 percent advance to 2365 billion 
manufacturing sales meanwhile declined 08 percent to 2375 
billion while wholesalers posted a 10 percent drop to 1520 
billion retail sales totaled 1500 billion

authorities have taken blood and saliva samples 
from former minister walker railey and say they may seek to 
prosecute him in the nearfatal choking attack on his wife three 
years ago 
deputy police chief ray hawkins said sunday he hopes to present 
the case to the district attorneys office for reconsideration on 
seeking a grand jury indictment later this month or early next 
month 
police have long considered railey 43 their prime suspect but 
have never persuaded the district attorney to charge him railey 
was found liable in a civil trial however 
at the time of the attack railey was the senior pastor of the 
first united methodist church of dallas and a prominent liberal 
minister whose sunday sermons were televised 
margaret peggy railey now 41 was choked with a cord in her 
home on the night of april 21 1987 she never regained 
consciousness and remains in a nursing home in what doctors call a 
persistent vegetative state with little chance of recovery 
although he has maintained his innocence railey has refused to 
cooperate with authorities and fully answer questions about the 
assault 
railey said he was away from the house at the time of the 
attack 
hawkins statement came only two days after a dallas detective 
and fbi agents picked railey up in california where he now lives 
and had him give blood and saliva samples the authorities had 
obtained a court order earlier friday to obtain the samples from a 
judge who then sealed all documents 
its fair to state that dr railey was surprised hawkins 
said 
hawkins refused to give details of the investigation fridays 
action by federal agents was the first in the case in some time 
in the weeks before the attack on his wife railey had reported 
receiving several threatening typewritten letters to him at church 
the letters which complained about raileys sermons urging racial 
tolerance were traced later to a typewriter in his church 
authorities also have said that railey failed to disclose a 
visit and phone call on the night of the attack to lucy papillon a 
dallas psychologist who later testified that the two were having an 
affair 
ten days after mrs railey was attacked on the day that police 
had planned to interview railey extensively he was found 
unconscious after attempting suicide with a drug overdose 
within the year he was hospitalized at a psychiatric hospital 
resigned his ministerial credentials gave up custody of his two 
young children and moved with ms papillon to california 
in 1988 a texas district judge found railey liable for the 
attack and ordered him to pay almost 18 million in damages he has 
paid nothing toward the civil judgment saying he is barely making 
enough to support himself

the bush administration spurred by events in 
the middle east set forth an ambitious negotiating schedule monday 
aimed at completing a comprehensive free trade agreement with 
oilrich mexico by the end of 1991 
administration officials said that president bush would formally 
submit to congress within the next few days a request for authority 
to negotiate an agreement dismantling barriers to the free flow of 
goods and investment between the two nations 
the administrations formal request starts a procedure in which 
congress has 60 legislative days a period expected to last until 
late spring to review the proposal if congress gives its assent 
which is considered likely then the administration can begin 
negotiations with mexico 
deputy us trade representative julius katz told members of the 
congressional joint economic committee that if negotiations begin 
in late spring he hoped to have an agreement wrapped up by the end 
of 1991 
that timetable would be significantly faster than the 18 months 
required to negotiate a freetrade agreement with canada 
katz told reporters later that us negotiators had learned a 
great deal from the uscanada free trade talks and believed that 
knowledge could be applied to speeding up a similar agreement with 
mexico 
administration officials have said that the middle east crisis 
has focused attention on americas trade relationship with mexico 
which has the eighth largest reserve of oil in the world 
the united states would like to work with mexico in accelerating 
oil production in mexico which currently stands at about 25 
million barrels of crude daily 
katz and other administration officials suggested monday that a 
free trade agreement with mexico would be a first step toward 
achieving the presidents goal of a hemispherewide free trade 
zone an achievement that katz said could be reached before the end 
of this decade 
members of the joint economic committee were generally 
supportive of the effort to remove trade barriers between the 
united states and other countries in latin america although sen 
paul sarbanes dmd questioned whether the administration had 
fully explored the impact on the us economy 
he questioned whether a free trade zone with mexico would 
encourage us manufacturers to move their operations to that 
country where the costs of labor were lower 
treasury under secretary david mulford said that while such an 
agreement would have a big impact on the mexican economy any 
effects on the us economy would likely be small given the 
relative size of the two economies mexicos total output is nly 4 
percent of americas 5 trillion annual economy 
mulford said that the administration was anxious to complete an 
agreement with mexico to reward mexican president carlos salinas de 
gortari for the freemarket economic reforms he has instituted in 
his country

the 12 european community nations 
decided today to expel iraqi military attaches and restrict the 
mobility of other personnel to protest iraqi raids last week of 
three countries diplomatic compounds in kuwait 
ec nations were also weighing a possible air blockade of iraq to 
enforce a un trade embargo 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said it was important to 
obtain backing from the un security council for such a move as 
was done for the naval blockade 
a french official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
12 states adopted a statement saying they decided in common 
accord to expel the military personnel at iraqi embassies and limit 
the freedom of movement of iraqi embassy personnel within the 
capitals 
before the joint statement was adopted today britain and 
belgium had already joined italy and france in implementing 
diplomatic sanctions against iraq 
britain expelled eight staff members from the iraqi embassy and 
ordered the deportation of 23 other iraqi citizens belgium 
restricted the mobility of iraqs diplomatic personnel in brussels 
following the ec statement the west german foreign ministry 
announced that it is expelling the iraqi military attache staff in 
bonn and restricting the movement of other iraqi diplomatic 
personnel 
the federal government has ordered the expulsion of the 
military attache staff of the iraqi embassy in bonn they have 48 
hours in which to leave the federal republic west germany a 
statement from the foreign ministry said 
the statement said other iraqi embassy personnel would be 
limited in their movements in west germany to bonn and the citys 
airport shared with cologne 
france and italy expelled several iraqi embassy employees over 
the weekend for the violations of the diplomatic missions 
some iraqi diplomatic missions in the member states do not have 
military attaches so these ec nations can only restrict the 
movement of diplomatic personnel 
this all arises because i feel the government feels that 
weve got to act in solidarity with the french and the other 
countries whose embassies have been invaded and people taken out 
during the last few days hurd said 
on sunday the un security council unanimously condemned the 
embassy incursions 
the foreign ministers were also discussing economic aid for to 
turkey egypt and jordan to compensate for loss of income suffered 
because of the gulf crisis the ec commission proposed that the 
foreign ministers approve 195 billion in economic aid to be 
disbursed through the end of 1991 
there is not full agreement that a decision on figures should 
be taken today the british official said 
some officials said the talks were delayed because france and 
britain wanted to take their military efforts in the persian gulf 
into account when deciding on the overall ec contribution 
ec foreign ministers first proposed sending about 2 billion to 
the three states during an informal meeting 10 days ago 
italy which holds the rotating ec presidency has said it will 
also propose setting up an ec panel to track the compliance with 
the un embargo against iraq the sanctions were imposed after the 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait

supreme court nominee david souter said today 
that he opposes a flat ban on the death penalty and that the 
constitution does not bar its use 
it was souters 51st birthday and his third day of testimony 
before the senate judiciary committee 
asked if the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment 
barred use of the death penalty souter replied i think that 
would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion 
he said he could not join any opinion that banned all 
capital punishment 
if confirmed souters view would be in line with the current 
majority of the high court his response underscored his reputation 
as a lawandorder judge 
souter explained his approach to a range of criminal law cases 
including one in which he supported police use of sobriety 
checkpoints 
during his tenure on the new hampshire supreme court it ruled 
against the checkpoints as extending police action too far in 
violation of peoples rights but souter alone dissented 
in his testimony today souter said the checkpoints differed 
from other searches because driving a car is a highly dangerous 
and regulated activity he said if the checkpoints were properly 
conducted police were correct in using them to try to prevent 
tragedy 
the use of police sobriety checks was upheld by the us supreme 
court earlier this year the court acting on a michigan case 
ruled 63 that such checkpoints do not violate the constitution 
on another issue souter was quizzed about his tough prosecution 
of antinuclear protesters when he was new hampshires attorney 
general and whether there was an appearance of impropriety 
because the builder of the seabrook nuclear plant was helping 
defray the law enforcement costs 
souter said he wasnt aware of the donations at the time and had 
not solicited them but in retrospect he said he should have 
insisted the money be returned 
i think that would have been an appropriate position to take 
and i wish i had taken it he said 
todays hearing started with birthday greetings for the new 
hampshire judge now 51 
happy birthday we didnt bake a cake but perhaps well let 
you go home after today said sen orrin hatch rutah who 
complimented souter for his handling of the committees questioning 
so far 
at the opening of the televised hearings last thursday sen 
edward m kennedy dmass said the burden of proof rests with 
those who support a nomination 
but the conduct of the hearings made clear the opposite was true 
the burden was on potential opponents to find some chink in 
souters yankee armor 
in two days of sparring with the committee last week souter 
skillfully ducked making specific responses on politically 
difficult issues especially abortion on that one he said he 
hadnt made up his mind and had made no promises to anyone 
key committee members including chairman joseph biden ddel 
said they planned to take another run at the privacy issue which 
is at the heart of the abortion debate and at others to see if 
there is a reason for opposing the nomination 
outside of the committee room feminist groups on friday 
announced their opposition because souter would not state he would 
support abortion rights on the court but so far no committee 
members have committed themselves to voting against him 
kennedy said friday he was troubled by some of souters 
responses to questions including one where the nominee offered 
what sounded like a callous explanation 
kennedy asked about a statement attributed to souter that said 
it dilutes the votes of those people who can read if 
illiterates are allowed to vote souter said the remark was kind 
of a statement of math 
souters response stood out in part because the bookish bachelor 
has taken great pains in the hearings to portray himself as 
compassionate and aware of a broad range of human concerns 
after it completes it hearings the committee will make its 
recommendation to the full senate 
souters supporters have expressed great confidence he will join 
the court this fall 
souter himself has been cautious however 
sen warren rudman rnh a longtime friend of souters who is 
playing host to him in washington during the nomination process 
said the judge wont even let people discuss possible places to 
live if he moves to the capital 
maybe hes superstitious rudman said

lech walesas astonishing mix of political 
instinct and personal charisma turned the stout peasants son into 
a candidate for polands presidency 
walesa has known the moment when to leap the shipyard fence and 
take charge of the 1980 strike that made the communists legalize 
solidarity when to say solidarity would take over the government 
in august 1989 as even close aides shook their heads dubiously 
if this is the time for him to become president he announced 
his candidacy monday it will be because of his uncanny ability to 
grip poles with his vision and persuade them to follow 
walesa was not born to political power he is the product of an 
impoverished farm in a remote northcentral hamlet of poland and 
his education came at a technical school 
he has never learned to speak polish smoothly or any other 
language at all he is unpredictable and at times maddeningly 
ambiguous he has been photographed fishing in his underwear his 
suit collection was recently expanded by three but is still single 
digit 
in fact there have been suggestions among poles that walesa 
46 is not learned or cultivated enough to be president 
criticism that i do not know how to talk with presidents 
walesa once scoffed i have talked to them and they want to talk 
with me 
when walesa drifted to gdansk and took a job at the lenin 
shipyard in 1967 no one would imagined that a little more than two 
decades later one foreign leader after another would be making the 
pilgrimage to the baltic port to see him nato general secretary 
manfred woerner and former president reagan came on saturday alone 
walesas anticommunist activism can be traced to 1970 food 
price riots in which police killed some of his fellow workers he 
translated his growing furor into unquestioned authenticity 
he lost one job after another as his labor activism increased 
and was outside the strikebound shipyard when he made the famous 
leap that merged his destiny with polands future 
in his subsequent 10 years as solidaritys leader he has 
maneuvered through martial law imprisonment repression and 
finally the communist regimes overtures and its eventual 
downfall 
along the way there were eight children a nobel peace prize in 
1983 and enormous prestige at home and abroad his mustachioed face 
on countless magazine covers a noticeable paunch and graying hair 
but no dimming of his twinkling eyes and there was the 
incalculable satisfaction of seeing polands revolution sweep the 
east bloc 
yet the new solidarityled government walesa organized included 
no official role for himself pushing aside accusations he was a 
jealous demagogue walesa started to foment against his former 
allies now leading the country 
many inside and out of poland did not want to believe his 
message that solidaritys unified days were over and political 
parties had to develop but most have come to agree and elections 
are imminent 
now walesa must wait for democracys decision on whether he will 
add the presidency to his biography

a new police crackdown on black 
faction fighting amounts to a license to kill for security 
forces africn national congress leader nelson mandela said 
monday 
president fw de klerk said he would announce further measures 
this week intended to halt street clashes in black townships near 
johannesburg that have killed almost 800 blacks since aug 12 
also monday police in pretoria arrested a rightwing extremist 
who claimed responsibility for bombing two offices of the governing 
national party boers state party deputy leader piet rudolph had 
been in hiding since a weapons theft at an air force base in april 
the party opposes efforts to end apartheid in south africa 
no major township violence was reported over the weekend or 
monday police said 
the new police measures codenamed operation iron fist were 
announced saturday in response to calls for the government to halt 
the township carnage 
they include more police and soldiers in the townships 
roadblocks searches for weapons use of dye dropped from 
helicopters to identify participants in clashes equipping police 
vehicles with mounted machine guns isolating workers hostels and 
squatter camps with razor wire and a dusktodawn curfew 
police spokesman col frans malherbe said all the measures 
except the curfew would be implemented this week 
the government previously declared the johannesburgarea 
townships unrest areas and poured in additional police and soldiers 
in a bid to halt the fighting but the street clashes continued 
de klerk said in pretoria that additional measures would be 
announced later this week he did not elaborate but said those 
participating in the violence would be prosecuted 
he also said the violence had shifted from attacks against the 
whiteled government to a power struggle among black factions 
the violence we have now is violence of various black 
political factions trying to get the upper hand within the black 
society so that they can play a leading role in the negotiation 
process the president said 
de klerk has pledged to eliminate the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and white dominance he also has called for 
negotiations on sharing power with the black majority 
mandela on a oneday tour of four small towns near cape town 
said the new police measures would be ineffective he was most 
upset by the mounting of machine guns on armored patrol vehicles 
police maj gen gerrit erasmus said the machines guns were for 
protection from attackers with assault rifles several policemen 
have been killed recently in such attacks 
from now on we can expect indiscriminate shootings whenever 
there are demonstrations no matter how peaceful mandela said 
in my view this is a license to kill 
the anc leader said police only need tear gas and water cannons 
to control demonstrations mandela also said he believes the 
security forces have helped orchestrate the violence 
in addition he reiterated charges that a sinister task 
force had participated in recent attacks on blacks intended to 
destabilize the situation witnesses have reported seeing white men 
with blackened faces participating in the attacks 
the government has said it would investigate such charges 
mandela said the governments failure to halt the unrest could 
upset planned negotiations on power sharing but he added to 
abandon the talks now would be to play into the hands of this task 
force 
but we will not stand by and see our people mowed down like 
dogs mandela said reiterating a threat to arm anc supporters 
the anc however is not believed to possess a large arsenal of 
weapons 
most of the fighting has been between zulus loyal to the 
conservative inkatha movement and xhosas and other blacks who 
support the anc 
the anc and inkatha the two largest black political movements 
both oppose apartheid but differ on tactics and plans for a future 
south africa 
under apartheid the 5 million whites dominate politics and the 
economy and the 30 million blacks have no voice in national 
affairs

the salvation army gives its clients soup 
soap and salvation but the federal government says that isnt 
enough they should get the minimum wage too 
for 110 years the nonsectarian christian group based five 
miles northwest here in verona has fed sheltered and offered 
spiritual counsel to the people it has taken in at its adult 
rehabilitation centers 
in exchange for room board and up to about 20 a week in pocket 
money the beneficiaries as the salvation army calls them assist 
in the organizations kitchens or unload the discarded furniture 
and clothes the army collects said william j moss the attorney 
for the salvation armys national headquarters 
one salvation army official in newark who spoke on condition of 
anonymity described the program as soup soap and salvation in 
the name of jesus 
the federal government however sees the situation differently 
the us department of labor claims the people to whom the 
salvation army ministers are employees exploited ones at that 
and should be entitled to a minimum wage under the fair labor 
standards act moss said 
the salvation army contends that payment of a wage could doom 
the social service centers which are kept financially afloat by a 
network of thrift shops they run across the country 
the salvation army is convinced that the beneficiaries are not 
employees entitled to the benefits of the fair labor standards act 
for the same reason that volunteers and students and trainees are 
not employees moss said sunday they are not there to exchange 
their services for compensation they are there for their own 
benefit to be rehabilitated 
according to the organization the work assignments teach the 
discipline of work to the emotionally and financially destitute and 
prepare them to become productive members of society 
labor department officials argue that other rehabilitation 
organizations such as goodwill industries inc do meet minimum 
wage standards 
the governments action stemmed from a complaint filed by a 
salvation army client in pittsburgh several years ago on sept 7 
the department concluded that the clients of the salvation army 
which maintains more than 11000 beds in 117 centers nationwide 
are entitled to protection under the fair labor standards act moss 
said the organization was given 10 days to respond to the letter 
on friday salvation army officials sent a letter to samuel d 
walker acting administrator of the labor departments wage and 
hour division advising him they would not comply with the minimum 
wage demand the army said it would do everything in its power to 
defend against threatened enforcement 
a department spokesman in washington did not immediately return 
a telephone call monday for comment

arab radicals meeting in amman on monday 
cheered calls for suicide attacks against american forces and for 
an islamic uprising to topple egyptian president hosni mubarak 
we have striking examples of heroes who turned their bodies 
into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to flee in 
darkness as happened to the american marines in beirut in 1983 
said ibrahim alkharraz of the libyan peoples congress 
the threeday conference of arab leftists islamic party members 
and palestinian guerrilla factions ended with an endorsement for a 
peaceful negotiated arab settlement of the persian gulf crisis 
but it also urged arabs to strike against the american 
interests everywhere and by all means at the same moment an 
american attack is launched agaist iraq 
the conference communique also said regular appeals would be 
made to arab troops in saudi arabia and some gulf states to rebel 
against their leaders and reject american orders 
alkharraz drew rapturous applause by exhorting arabs to swiftly 
move against us forces and saudi oil pipelines he urged them to 
follow the example of jaul jamal a syrian gunboat commander who 
died in 1956 when he deliberately rammed his vessel into a french 
warship during fighting over the suez canal 
he also hailed the suicide bombers who killed 241 us marines 
in an attack on their beirut barracks in 1983 
we have to move swiftly and with all means against the 
american military presence on the peninsula and in the gulf and 
follow the examples of the arab struggles in the 50s and the 
60s alkharraz said 
the call for mubaraks ouster came from adnan saududdin a 
member of the jordanian islamic front and the fundamentalist moslem 
brotherhood he made an impassioned plea for an islamic uprising to 
free egypt from the shackles of the treasonous camp david 
accords 
the 150 delegates from 11 arab countries officially represent 
only their individual organizations so the communique did not 
necessarily reflect the positions of their governments 
jordan for example agreed to act as host for the conference 
although king hussein has called for iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
and allow the ousted emir to return however the king has resisted 
western pressure to publicly condemn iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
saddam has won support in the arab world by insisting that any 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait must be tied to a similar israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied territories and a solution to the 
palestinian problem the united states objects to linking the iraqi 
and israeli issues 
the arab triumph had already started when an arab leader said 
no to america and slapped its face we will slap the face of bush 
with the shoes of iraqi soldiers saududdin told the conference 
being leftists communists baathist or islamist is not 
important what is important is for us all to stand in the same 
trench with iraq against israel the united states and their 
allies saududdin said 
groups from morocco tunisia algeria libya sudan mauritania 
yemen lebanon syria jordan iraq and the palestine liberation 
organization were invited to the conference it was organized by 
the jordanian arab national democratic alliance

ronald reagan visiting the soviet union for the 
first time since leaving the white house on monday cautioned the 
15 fractious republics against letting their passion for 
independence boil over 
the former president speaking to lawmakers in the supreme 
soviet parliament recalled the wrenching and terrible civil 
war fought by american states over their division of powers with 
washington 
as you find a reformulation of the relationships in your union 
you will find there is a period of uncertainty and tension he 
told the parliaments international committee 
differences can be resolved in ways that are fair to all but 
reason must prevail over passion if there is to be a climate 
conducive to the settlement of disagreements 
president mikhail s gorbachev is trying to negotiate a new 
treaty giving more autonomy to the soviet unions ethnically and 
geographically diverse republics but 13 of them have already have 
declared some form of independence or sovereignty in which their 
laws would take precedence over national laws 
reagan and his wife nancy arrived in the soviet union in 
leningrad on sunday the start of a fiveday visit proposed by 
gorbachev when they last met in san francisco in june the two men 
greeted one another monday with a warm embrace and gorbachev 
praised reagans contribution toward better superpower relations 
im sure you must have sense by now during your stay here in 
this country that we and people in soviet society hold you in 
tremendous esteem and respect gorbachev said before talks in his 
kremlin office 
the official tass news agency said gorbachev and reagan had a 
substantial and sincere talk discussing the persian gulf 
crisis the prospects for continued cooperation between the soviet 
union and the united states and the outlook for cutting strategic 
nuclear weapons 
parliamentary committee chairman alexander dzasokhov said 
reagans presidency began in 1981 with a vision of our country as 
one that was covered with thunderclouds a country that was the 
source of trouble to the whole world 
by the time he left office in 1989 reagan had formed a 
different and fair image dzasokhov told about 50 lawmakers 
in his speech reagan marveled at the reforms that have swept 
eastern europe and the soviet union since his fourth presidential 
summit with gorbachev in moscow in may 1988 
these are yeasty times times of ferment he said freedom 
can bring out passions between groups of people that may boil over 
when they do cool and calm decisions are called for by leaders so 
as to lower temperatures all around 
reagan said political changes might come easier than economic 
changes as the soviet union struggles to replace its centrally 
planned command economy with a market economy 
there will be disappointment and discouragement at times he 
said there will be trials and errors but if you have the 
courage to persist you will create an economy within which all can 
prosper 
reagan also said mistrust between the soviet union and the 
united states has given way to cautious friendship 
he predicted gradual arms reductions by both superpowers in the 
next five years as we find new ways to work together on matters 
where our goals are similar 
together our great size can be used in the service of all 
humankind to persuade those whose passions have reached the danger 
point to cool down again

a hauler stored medical waste human 
tissue and dangerous solvents at a boat marina and near a grocery 
store because he could not afford to dispose of the waste properly 
former ballbearing salesman richard kirkham said it was easy to 
become licensed to dispose of hazardous waste but more difficult to 
find places to store the refuse 
kirkhams hazardous waste management inc stored 95 barrels of 
hazardous solvents fuels and toxic chemicals at scotts marina no 
2 on lake grapevine authorities said they also found said they 75 
drums of chemical solvents and several cartons filled with used 
syringes soiled dressings surgical gloves and human tissue at 
kirkhams office and at a warehouse near a fort worth grocery 
store 
kirkham was caught removing watersoaked cartons of medical 
debris from shoreline boat stalls last november after the lake 
northeast of fort worth receded following a flood 
dallas water utilities officials shut down a water treatment 
plant for two days last november before determining there was no 
evidence of contamination from the wastes 
the discovery triggered a threestate criminal investigation of 
kirkhams onetruck operation 
kirkham has been fined 260 while it has cost 125000 so far 
to clean up the boxes and barrels he stashed at the marina the 
fort worth startelegram reported sunday 
no evidence has been found that kirkhams illegal inventory 
polluted the environment federal officials said 
a simple registration form made kirkham one of the states 2034 
hazardouswaste transporters in 1986 his company went unwatched by 
state and federal regulators 
he wasnt affected by the stringent rules imposed on licensed 
disposal sites that would have guaranteed that he had the money to 
destroy what he collected instead he started the firm with a 
pickup and four weeks of training at texas aampm university 
kirkham said he never intended to run the business illegally 
but his struggling operation was derailed when the sandhauling 
truck he used to subsidize the fledgling wastehauling business was 
wrecked he used the money paid by waste producers to repair the 
sand truck instead of properly disposing of the waste 
and the reason that we did it is that hope springs eternal in 
the breast of man kirkham told the startelegram we kept 
thinking things would get better 
kirkham said that when he could no longer afford to pay disposal 
fees he forged records to convince his customers that their waste 
was reaching its destination 
in june the environmental protection agency notified 214 of 
kirkhams clients that they were potentially liable for his actions 
and billed each of them the full cost of storing and disposing of 
the waste found at the boat dock 
among those notified were texas aampm university parkland 
memorial hospital in dallas the navy the army corps of engineers 
and the first baptist church of dallas 
officials with the us attorneys office in fort worth 
confirmed in july they are continuing a criminal investigation of 
kirkham and waste management that was started by the epa in

president bush offered assurances today that 
the command structure in saudi arabia will work well and us 
forces wont stand around waiting for someone else to give the 
order to fight 
the command structure will function very very smoothly 
bush told a news conference 
the president also said he believes the american public is 
magnificently united behind the international effort to end 
saddam husseins occupation of kuwait but he cautioned im not 
clear in my own mind on how long this kind of support holds up 
bush was asked who would give the orders to us forces to 
shoot the question apparently was in reference to directions 
earlier this month to american fighter pilots to wait for a 
goahead from saudi commanders before firing at iraqi jets 
i have no hesitancy at all to say to the parents of the kids 
over there should something happen that required combat the 
command structure will function very very smoothly bush said 
were not going to have to stand around waiting for someone 
else to decide if there is some provocation either he said 
bush also appeared to support extending the naval embargo to an 
air blockade of iraq 
i would be prepared to work with anybody to tie that 
additional knot in the sanctions he said the us ambassador 
thomas r pickering said sunday a resolution would be drafted to 
impose an air embargo a step the united nations has never taken 
against a nation pickering briefed bush today 
bush said he wants to bring the 150000strong us forces home 
as soon as possible but he said he did not know when that 
would be 
what we are trying is this allout fullcourt international 
press on the diplomatic side i want to see that work said bush 
he said he is hearing varying assessments from world leaders on how 
well the sanctions are working 
what if the crisis erupts into war with thousands of american 
casualties 
i dont know but i am inclined to feel that we are off to a 
very good start bush said at a news conference with regional 
reporters 
im old enough to remember a clearcut case different 
circumstances different times world war ii he said there 
was a lot of sorrow there was a lot of regret everyone identified 
with the families who lost loved ones but the country stayed 
fairly well together 
now at this juncture i think the american people are 
magnificently united in terms of standing up against this 
aggression bush said 
he declined comment on defense secretary dick cheneys decision 
to fire air force chief of staff gen mike dugan for his blunt 
remarks identifying targets in a possible massive air strike 
against iraq 
ill have nothing to say about that except i strongly support 
our secretary of defense the president said 
cheney said he relieved dugan of his office because he violated 
pentagon policy in discussing specific targets for air strikes 
revealed classified information and demeaned the contribution of 
other services 
relieving him is not a pleasant task but i felt it was a 
necessary one cheney told reporters at the white house 
on other matters bush said 
he does not plan to draw down the strategic petroleum reserve 
at this time claiming i have not felt there is a shortage but 
he said a case could be made that tapping the reserve would help 
stabilize gasoline prices 
the mideast crisis should lay rest to talk about a peace 
dividend in the defense budget ive always thought that was a 
phantom how can you declare a dividend when youre operating at a 
loss he asked 
iran has provided indirect assurances that it wants to see the 
sanctions against iraq work despite deep differences that remain 
between the us and iran but some factions within iran will 
continue to resist improvement in relations with the united 
states he said about an ayatollahs call for a holy war 
bush said an air embargo against baghdad would be hard to 
enforce 
earlier the white house said the hostile reaction in baghdad to 
bushs televised appeal to the iraqi people demonstrates how 
effective his message was 
bush got his chance sunday to make his case directly to the 
iraqi people saying the only way for iraq to avoid a war it cannot 
win is to end its occupation of kuwait 
that decision is in the hands of saddam hussein bush said 
in a taped address broadcast over iraqi television sunday 
bushs eightminute message was followed immediately by a 
lengthy criticism by saddams spokesman charging that bushs words 
were full of lies and contradictions it set off demonstrations 
in the streets of baghdad with iraqis chanting death to bush 
and death to america 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the angry response 
shows that bushs speech was very effective 
the most telling aspect was the lengthy and extraordinarily 
personal attack against the president immediately following it 
fitzwater said as well as the organized demonstrations 
they obviously felt it was necessary to try to discredit the 
united states as much as possible the white house spokesman 
said 
we think its important to be able to get the word through to 
the people of iraq about the worlds unanimity against iraq and 
to be able to speak forthrightly about what the us role is 
said fitzwater 
were glad they gave us the opportunity he said 
dugan will no longer serve as the air forces top commander but 
he retains his rank as a fourstar general the pentagon said 
the pentagons rare disciplinary action of a top officer came 
one day after published reports quoted dugan as saying us 
military authorities had concluded that massive air strikes are the 
only effective way of forcing iraq out of kuwait if war erupted 
dugan was on a tour of us military installations in saudi arabia 
when he made his comments in an interview with the los angeles 
times and the washington post 
bush and the cabinet also heard firsthand from secretary of 
state james a baker iii about the 14 billion pledged by americas 
allies for the gulf effort 
baker returned early sunday from an 11day mission to europe and 
the middle east during which he solicited help for the costly stand 
in the saudi desert 
saddam hussein tells you that this crisis is a struggle 
between iraq and america in fact it is iraq against the world 
bush said in his televised message to iraqis 
iraq finds itself on the brink of war bush said 
let me say clearly there is no way iraq can win ultimately 
iraq must withdraw from kuwait he said 
war is not inevitable it is still possible to bring this 
crisis to a peaceful end he said

international pressure on saddam hussein intensified monday as 
european nations expelled iraqi diplomats to retaliate for raids on 
embassies in occupied kuwait and support appeared to grow for an 
air embargo against iraq 
oil prices jumped monday pointing to pessimism about prospects 
for a settlement of the 6weekold persian gulf standoff oil 
futures soared to record levels above 33 a barrel on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
in a sign of iraqs growing isolation the soviet union 
baghdads longtime patron said monday it would reestablish 
diplomatic ties with saudi arabia the saudis infuriated iraq by 
agreeing to become the main staging ground for the deployment of a 
usled multinational force after the aug 2 iraqi takeover of 
kuwait 
sensitivities about the role of the us force were underscored 
when a top us military man was sacked after discussing 
contingency plans to launch massive air strikes against baghdad and 
target saddam personally 
the fired official air force chief of staff gen mike dugan 
made the remarks while touring us military installations in saudi 
arabia and they were published sunday in the washington post and 
the los angeles times 
there are certain things we never talk about we never discuss 
operational matters such as the selection of specific targets for 
potential air strikes an angry defense secretary dick cheney 
told reporters in washington he dismissed dugan after consulting 
president bush 
bush meanwhile said he considered americans to be 
magnificently united behind the us military effort in the 
gulf but he cautioned im not clear in my own mind on how long 
this kind of support holds up 
at a news conference monday the president said he wanted to 
bring home the 150000 us troops in the region as soon as 
possible but did not know when that would be 
arab radical groups meanwhile ended a threeday conference in 
amman jordan on monday with calls for suicide attacks on the us 
forces 
we have the striking examples of heroes who turned their 
bodies into bombs that horrified the aggressors and forced them to 
flee in darkness libyan ibrahim alkharraz told delegates 
referring to the 1983 bombing of the marine barracks in beirut that 
killed 241 us servicemen 
in iraq there was an outburst of antiamerican sentiment in the 
staterun newspapers monday a day after iraqi television broadcast 
an eightminute message from bush to the iraqi people shut up 
mr bush one headline said 
bushs videotaped message in which he warned that saddam was 
leading iraq into war was followed immediately by an iraqi 
commentary blasting the speech as full of lies and 
contradictions hundreds of demonstrators then took to the 
streets of baghdad chanting death to bush and death to 
america 
the bush administration said the hostile reaction demonstrated 
the effectiveness of bushs message they obviously felt it was 
necessary to try to discredit the united states as much as 
possible white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
at the kuwaitsaudi border iraqi troops unexpectedly opened the 
only border crossing over the weekend and about 6000 kuwaitis 
fled their homeland the flow slowed to a trickle monday 
refugees said iraqi troops were seizing draftage kuwaiti men 
and forcing their wives and daughters to travel to saudi arabia 
without them us officials expressed concern over kuwaitis being 
forced to leave their identity papers with iraqi border guards 
the confiscation of identity papers is an ominous sign that 
these citizens of kuwait may not be allowed to return to their 
homes state department spokesman richard boucher said if this 
is part of an iraqi effort to drive kuwaitis from their homes it 
is unacceptable 
in brussels belgium the 12 european community nations 
announced they would expel iraqi military attaches and their staffs 
and restrict travel by other embassy personnel to protest breakins 
by iraqi troops at diplomatic premises in occupied kuwait last 
week 
the iraqi raids on dutch french belgian and canadian embassies 
or diplomatic residences were unanimously condemned sunday by the 
un security council 
britain said monday it was deporting eight diplomats and 23 
iraqi nationals deemed a danger to national security and west 
germany gave walking papers to the iraqi military attaches staff 
italy said monday it was expelling 11 iraqi embassy employees who 
worked in the military attaches office 
the ec ministers were also weighing a possible air blockade of 
iraq to enforce the un trade embargo against iraq british 
foreign secretary douglas hurd said there was strong support among 
the ec ministers for such a blockade 
the belgian foreign affairs minister mark eyskens concurred 
everybody was arguing for an air blockade he said 
hurd said however that it was important to obtain backing from 
the un security council for such a step un diplomats on sunday 
began drafting a new resolution to close iraqs air routes and 
punish nations flouting the embargo us officials said 
an air blockade would involve the interception of planes 
approaching iraq and would pose a far greater danger of triggering 
hostilities than the boarding of ships in the persian gulf 
hurd also renewed complaints about iraqs treatment of diplomats 
in kuwait where about a dozen nations including the united 
states are defying baghdads orders to close their embassies 
they are surrounded by soldiers they cant get food or drink 
in hurd said 
in other developments 
four french nationals a married couple and two men arrived 
in amman jordan on monday after being freed from iraq they said 
they were held in a site about an hour from baghdad with about 10 
other hostages including an american iraq is using trapped 
westerners as human shields against attack on key iraqi 
installations 
irelands department of foreign affairs said three irishmen had 
been jailed in iraq on charges of attempting to escape the country 
also west germany said iraqi troops seized another west german in 
kuwait raising to 44 the number of west germans held by baghdad 
an egyptian military source said egypt was sending 250 soldiers 
to saudi arabia monday and more would follow in a few days joining 
the estimated 4000 egyptian troops in the region 
a senior iranian delegation met in baghdad with an iraqi team 
to discuss normalization of ties between the two nations which 
fought a war from 1980 to 1988 saddam last month initiated a 
prisoner exchange agreed to shared sovereignty over a key waterway 
that forms the southern border between the two countries and 
removed troops from iranian territory captured during the war but 
the red cross says the monthlong prisoner exchange has stopped 
in beijing 42 kuwaiti athletes and a coach arrived monday to 
take part in the asian games which begin saturday kuwaits 
national olympic committee now based in exile in saudi arabia 
said athletes who were out of the country during the iraqs aug 2 
invasion would participate

aides from the embassy in london foreign secretary douglas hurd 
indicated the home office would soon be annoucing further sanctions 
against iraq

saudi arabia and more will follow in a few days joining the 
estimated 4000 egyptian troops already in the region the source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said egypt would also send 
egytian tanks armored personel carriers and air defense systems to 
saudi arabia by ship across the red sea 
 
israeli army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron says israel 
will not automatically respond in kind to an iraqi invasion of 
jordan signaling an easing of israels stand on the gulf crisis 
the comment reported by israeli newspapers followed suggestions 
that an iraqi invasion of jordan could be aimed at drawing israel 
into the gulf conflict as a way of uniting arab nations behind 
iraq 
 
in a sign of iraqs growing isolation the soviet union 
baghdads longtime patron said it would reestablish diplomatic 
ties with saudi arabia 
 
iraqi troops randomly seized young men among the thousands of 
refugees fleeing kuwait but let their sobbing wives mothers and 
other women go refugees said busloads of men between the ages of 
17 and 40 were seen being shipped north toward iraq no 
explanation was given other young men were allowed to pass 
through

a judge monday dismisssed a 50 million damage suit 
accusing the usbacked contras of torturing and executing 
benjamin linder an american volunteer killed during the nicaraguan 
civil war 
us district judge stanley marcus said the case intruded too 
far into the diplomatic arena 
political branches could be hampered in their ability to 
conduct sensitive foreign policy initiatives with foreign groups 
involved in civil war if the conduct later becomes subject to suits 
by private citizens challenging the nature of warmaking on foreign 
soil the judge wrote 
linder 27 of portland ore was shot to death in nicaragua in 
april 1987 when usbacked rebels attacked the rural hydroelectric 
project he was helping to build 
a year later his family with the backing of the new yorkbased 
center for constitutional rights sued miamibased contra leaders 
enrique bermudez adolfo calero and aristides sanchez 
the contra war against nicaraguas leftist government formally 
ended after free elections put president violeta chamorro in power 
in february 
defense attorney john kirkpatrick said monday he was delighted 
by the judges ruling 
this was a political lawsuit filed by a political group for 
political reasons and the judge understood that kirkpatrick 
said 
he said center for constitutional rights had filed five lawsuits 
against the usbacked contra effort and all five had been 
dismissed 
the linders lawyer michael ratner said he was disappointed 
i think the execution and torture of an american citizen is 
something that should be seen as a violation of international 
law he said i am sure we will appeal and eventually we will 
win 
benjamins father david linder has accused the contras of 
torturing and killing his son to intimidate other foreign 
volunteers who were aiding the sandinistas the suit said the 
decision was made by the miamibased contra leadership 
the linders said an independent autopsy showed their son was 
stuck with needles in his face before he was finally shot to death 
the contras said linder was in a sandinista uniform at the time 
of his death and carried a weapon they called him a casualty of 
war

a controversial proposal to streamline beef 
inspections should be adopted by the agriculture department 
including a feature putting greater reliance on packing companies 
the national academy of sciences said monday 
but a report from the academy said that the department if it 
relies more heavily on private industry to maintain meat quality 
should concentrate its resources on safety to guard consumers 
against microbial and chemical contamination 
the federal government should design its inspection programs 
to focus on contemporary health issues the report said it 
should insist that industry comply with policies and procedures 
required to protect public health and foster public confidence in 
the safety of the food supply 
for example although supporting the speededup inspection 
system for cattle the report said the departments food safety and 
inspection service or fsis should develop methods for quickly 
testing carcasses for microbial and chemical contamination 
the streamlined inspection service for cattle slaughter or 
sisc was studied by a panel of the academys institute of 
medicine under a 154000 grant from the department 
from a food safety viewpoint sisc alone is probably no 
better and in some situations can be less effective than 
traditional inspection because the reduced oversight by government 
inspectors is not compensated by a total commitment to product 
quality on the part of the industry the report said 
but the report also called the streamlined system the most 
important change in bovine meat inspection since federal 
supervision was begun in 1906 
for this system to work in practice both fsis and industry 
must fully endorse the philosophy of shifting responsibility for 
meat quality from fsis to industry so that the government can 
concentrate on safety the report said 
the plan was officially proposed in november 1988 usda 
spokesman jim greene said an amended proposal would probably be 
made based on the new study 
greene said the department plans to begin using the revised 
system within two years but only in plants that slaughter fed 
cattle for the slaughter market these cattle are mostly 
grainfattened steers and heifers from feedlots 
the report said about 80 of the nations more than 1300 
usdainspected cattle slaughter plants would be eligible to use the 
system those account for an estimated 80 percent of the fed cattle 
slaughtered for the consumer market 
lester m crawford fsis administrator said the 11month study 
by the scientific panel confirms our ongoing commitment to 
modernize inspection at cattle slaughter plants is on solid 
footing 
under traditional inspections federal inspectors check bile 
ducts heart cheek muscles and numerous lymph nodes for disease 
and other abnormalities they also are responsible for condemnation 
and disposition of diseased carcasses as well as supervising the 
trimming undesirable parts 
but under sisc plant employees would incise heart and cheek 
muscles position parts for inspectors and assume responsibility 
for some trimming 
inspectors still would be responsible for condemnation and 
disposition of diseased carcasses and still would examine every 
head viscera and carcass 
the streamlined inspection system is currently used 
experimentally in five meat plants using highspeed techniques to 
slaughter steers and heifers for the beef market 
agency officials said those include two montfort plants in 
greeley colo and grand island neb two excel plants in friona 
and plainview texas and a national beef plant in liberal kan 
the industrys american meat institute called the report an 
objective assessment of the new inspection program and that it 
may help to end the controversy over the merits of sisc 
tom devine of the consumeroriented government accountability 
project which has helped federal whistleblowers to criticize usda 
inspection operations said he was delighted by the report 
its a gratifying vindication for the concerns raised by 
whistleblowers who as usda inspectors alleged there have been 
many slipshod unsanitary practices in plants where the new system 
has been used he said

inhumanely his grandmother says 
i know hes getting very upset and he doesnt know why elna 
hlavaty said of her grandson edward lewis humphrey in an 
interview published monday 
theyre treating him like hes ready for the gallows and he 
hasnt even been charged said ms hlavaty who visited him last 
weekend in the brevard county jail more than 100 miles from 
gainesville 
also monday a 17yearold montana girl was quoted as saying she 
spurned humphreys marriage proposals about a month before the 
slayings 
meanwhile life has been returning to normal in this bustling 
college town police spokeswoman lt sadie darnell on monday 
canceled daily news briefings saying no major breaks were 
imminent 
the citys chamber of commerce dedicated this week to paying 
tribute to the slain students asking residents to display white 
ribbons on mailboxes fly flags at halfstaff and attend a 
treeplanting ceremony friday 
humphrey an 18yearold university of florida freshman has 
been identified as one of eight suspects in the stabbing deaths of 
the five students three of whom were mutilated hes been held in 
lieu of 1 million bond for nearly three weeks on unrelated 
charges including one that he beat his 79yearold grandmother on 
aug 30 two days after the last of the bodies were found 
humphrey is being kept in a medical isolation cell with only a 
mattress and a blanket and is reportedly given daily doses of 
lithium to control his manic depression his grandmother says 
thats not fair 
hes afraid and im afraid ms hlavaty told the gainesville 
sun they have no evidence against him in those murders yet they 
make no effort to be humane or decent to him 
she said one of his legs injured in a car accident and 
scheduled for surgery in december has given him much pain because 
he can sit only on the floor of his cell 
ms hlavaty who denies humphrey beat her and says she was 
injured in a fall said he was pressured into making wild 
statements after hours of grueling interrogation 
published reports have said he gave investigators specific 
information about crime scenes and attributed two deaths to 
john authorities say john is one of several personalities 
humphrey has displayed in jail 
if someone bullied you for hours and hours and abused you 
while you were wearing handcuffs you wouldnt be able to take it 
anymore ms hlavaty said you wouldnt know if uou were john 
sue or jane my grandson is a victim and hes vulnerable because of 
his mental illness 
brevard county public defender jr russo played down a report 
that investigators had found bloodstained gloves in the indialantic 
home where humphrey lived with his grandmother and mother 
it could have been from a fishing trip or anything else 
russo said 
ms hlavaty said the gloves belong to her and that they were 
stained with her blood when she fell and cut her head 
in montana a high school senior named rachel who asked that 
her last name be withheld told the tampa tribune she met humphrey 
in 1985 while he was visiting an aunt and uncle 
she said she didnt see him again until july 18 when he traveled 
more than 1000 miles to hamilton mont to propose to her the 
tribune reported monday 
he really became possessed with the idea of marrying me she 
said 
the girls mother who spoke on condition that her name not be 
used told the associated press the teenager locked herself in her 
room and cried last week when reports of her friendship with 
humphrey surfaced 
shes upset at the implication that something she did may have 
led to these deaths she said

gov george mickelson said a videotaped 
discussion he had with brookings high school seniors will not be 
used in political advertising because of objections from students 
and teachers 
mickelson spoke to about 100 seniors in his hometown last 
wednesday at the invitation of principal don kolsrud parts of his 
speech were professionally videotaped along with a 
questionandanswer session that followed 
superintendent stephen doerr said the school administration knew 
mickelson was filming the session for television but thought the 
discussion took a back stage to the filming 
i think there were times when the producer more so than the 
governor made it a commercial venture doerr said 
democratic governor candidate bob samuelson said the governor 
shouldnt have tried to film a commercial during school hours 
regardless if students knew he was taping a political 
advertisement 
the governor said he and his campaign staff explained their 
plans ahead of time to the school administration and school board 
and that students were told over the intercom that he would be 
filming his conversation with them

own 
police searched monday for the two men who accosted the women 
just outside the mayors home sunday night and forced them inside 
while suarez and his children were upstairs said police spokesman 
david rivero 
my kids and i very quickly converged in the upstairs room

the state department responded to philippine 
president corazon aquinos announcement monday that she wants an 
orderly withdrawal of us bases from her country by saying the 
united states wants to stay 
state department spokesman richard boucher declined to discuss 
the us position in bases talks or to even confirm that the 
negotiations are opening on tuesday in manila 
but boucher repeated that the united states wants to retain its 
military presence in the philippines which includes two of 
americas largest foreign bases clark air base and subic naval 
base 
we hope that any new agreement will include provisions for a 
continuing defense relationship including us access to 
philippine military facilities boucher said 
he said the talks would define a new relationship with the 
philippines that includes a security dimension 
asked if he had any specific response to mrs aquinos 
statement boucher said im afraid thats my comment on cory 
aquinos speech as well 
us officials have repeatedly said that they will give up the 
bases if the philippines decides it doesnt want them alternative 
sites for various installations have been explored throughout the 
region 
under the current agreement which expires in one year the us 
military has unlimited access to clark subic and four smaller 
facilities making them de facto us bases although they 
technically belong to the philippines 
mrs aquino in a nationally televised speech said the bases 
talks would redefine usphilippine relations and added that her 
government would work with the united states for arrangements 
regarding the orderly withdrawal of their forces from our 
country 
more than 40000 american troops defense department civilians 
and military dependents now live in the philippines us officials 
tally the economic benefits to the philippines in hundreds of

thousands of teachers struck new orleans 
public schools monday in a contract dispute over working conditions 
and 400000 worth of health benefits the citys first teachers 
strike since 1978 
were not striking just for money were looking for 
professional respect said sixthgrade teacher katy hall one of 
a halfdozen teachers picketing lafayette elementary school before 
dawn i think the public looks upon us only as professional baby 
sitters 
maybe one in 10 toilets work theres no toilet paper no 
teaching supplies no ditto paper theres always a shortage of 
textbooks said joseph wally johnson who teaches computer 
science at lafayette 
frank fudesco the boards chief negotiator denied that there 
was any shortage of toilet tissue 
union and school board officials said they did not know how many 
of the 84000 students were in class or how many of the 5000 
teachers crossed picket lines principals who were called for spot 
checks said 75 to 90 percent of their students were in 
parents of some emotionally disturbed or educationally disabled 
children were told that classes for their children were canceled 
otherwise the school board said classes would continue as usual 
no contract talks were scheduled 
also starting strikes monday were two districts in pennsylvania 
cumberland valley in cumberland county with 6457 students at 10 
schools and 425 teachers and penndelco in delaware county with 
3000 students at six schools and 187 teachers 
new orleans union president nat lacour said the orleans parish 
school boards refusal to pay 400000 in health insurance premiums 
triggered the strike 
the teachers scaled back their request over the weekend to 1 
million in additional health benefits the school board turned them 
down and stuck to the 600000 it had offered 
we cannot give what we do not have said fudesco 
sharon delahoussaye picket captain at lusher elementary said 
premiums went up from 500 to 800 a person this year the union 
wants the board to cover half the 300 difference she said 
the boards first proposal was for 50 a person the second 
was for 100 were asking 150 a person said delahoussaye 
lacour reinstated demands dropped during earlier bargaining 
for a 45 million package that includes 10 percent annual pay 
raises for the teachers plus 1100 teachers aides and school 
secretaries 
louisiana teachers get much of their pay from the state which 
increased its share 7 percent this year the state now pays 14472 
for a starting teacher with a bachelors degree and 25737 for 
someone with a doctorate and 25 years experience said wj 
cleveland of the fiscal office for the state education department 
some poor rural poarishes dont add anything to that cleveland 
estimated that the average parish supplement is 3500 
new orleans adds 4983 to a starting salary and 9374 at the 
top of the scale so that starting teachers get 19455 and someone 
at top gets 35111 
the city is offering no raise 
the board has raised teachers salaries twice since 1983 but 
lacour said the increases have been eroded by rising health 
insurance and retirement costs

president bush on monday endorsed expanding 
the iraqi trade embargo to include air traffic as a way of 
increasing pressure on saddam hussein he expressed concern ove 
whether americans will stand united if the showdown drags on too 
long 
im not clear in my own mind at how long this kind of support 
holds up bush said 
still he said the country is magnificently united at this 
point and recalled that the nation stayed fairly well together 
during world war ii 
bush at a news conference also said that in retrospect he 
regrets the us policy of patient diplomacy toward iraq before it 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 at the time the administration was 
resisting congressional attempts to impose sanctions against iraq 
if everybody had the benefit of total hindsight why youd go 
back and say this doesnt make much sense bush said of the 
policy he pursued im not sure having said that that that 
would have changed saddam husseins intention to take over 
kuwait 
bush met with regional reporters after the firing of gen mike 
dugan by defense secretary dick cheney as air force chief of staff 
for discussing contingency plans for the bombing of iraq and the 
targeting of saddam personally bush endorsed the firing but 
refused to comment on the subject further 
the president offered clear support for stiffening the un 
sanctions against iraq by imposing an embargo on air traffic in 
addition to the existing naval blockade if approved it would be 
the first time the un had ever authorized an air blockade 
what we want to do is tighten up the united nations sanctions 
so nothing is going in bush said and thats hard to do in 
terms of overflights and some countries that seem to be more 
willing than others to avoid the sanctions 
nevertheless he said i would be prepared to work with 
anybody to tie that additional knot in the sanctions 
bush offered no predictions about how long american troops will 
be stationed in the persian gulf more than 150000 us forces 
already have been deployed and the buildup shows no sign of ending 
i want those soldiers out as soon as possible he said i 
want them all out all out period and yet i cant say when that 
will be 
on sunday a taped address from bush was broadcast in iraq 
warning the iraqi people they were on the brink of war because 
of the invasion of kuwait bush said the effort was worthwhile 
even if only two iraqis heard it 
if nothing else bush said laughingly it got a good exercise 
for the demonstrators who had been notified to demonstrate against 
the united states before they even heard what i had to say so it 
kept them hustling around jumping up and down screaming about the 
united states 
bush was asked who would give the orders to us forces to shoot 
if fighting breaks out the question apparently was in reference to 
directions earlier this month to american fighter pilots to wait 
for a goahead from saudi commanders before firing at iraqi jets 
i have no hesitancy at all to say to the parents of the kids 
over there should something happen that required combat the 
command structure will function very very smoothly bush said 
were not going to have to stand around waiting for someone 
else to decide if there is some provocation either he said 
asked how the nation would react to thousands of american 
casualties bush replied i dont know but i am inclined to feel 
that we are off to a very good start bush said 
im old enough to remember a clearcut case different 
circumstances different times world war ii he said there 
was a lot of sorrow there was a lot of regret everyone identified 
with the families who lost loved ones but the country stayed 
fairly well together 
bush defended his decision not to tap into the huge strategic 
petroleum reserve for fuel to offset any shortages due to the 
embargo and help keep gas prices low it is my judgment that 
there isnt such a shortage at this time the president said he 
said gas prices were being driven not by shortages but by 
speculation about what will happen 
the president said the persian gulf crisis has not prompted him 
to reconsider his decision to ban new offshore oil drilling in 
california however he said he was determined to more vigorously 
go forward with incentives for domestic drilling including in 
alaska 
the bottom line he said its going to have to be 
conservation its going to have to be alternative sources its 
going to have to be more hydrocarbon drilling 
he said the mideast crisis should lay rest to talk about a 
peace dividend in the defense budget ive always thought 
that was a phantom how can you declare a dividend when youre 
operating at a loss he asked 
he also said iran has provided indirect assurances that it wants 
to see the sanctions against iraq work despite deep differences 
that remain between the us and iran im not going to buy into 
the argument that theyve iran made some secret deal to violate 
the sanctions bush said

the united states and the soviet union offered 
to send technical experts to peace talks between angolas leftist 
government and usbacked rebels the state department said 
monday 
us officials said the proposed assistance would be limited to 
the mechanics of enforcing a ceasefire once negotiators for the 
government and the rebels agree to take that step 
the proposal represents another marked departure for the two 
superpowers from their onetime bitter rivalry over angola the 
soviets have contributed military aid to the angolan government 
over the years while the united states has been arming the unita 
rebels since 1986 
both are continuing to provide arms to their respective clients 
but also seem eager to promote a settlement the angola war has 
raged since 1976 
washington and moscow have offered to provide experts at the 
technical level for the next round of talks between unita and the 
luanda authorities to be held under portuguese auspices and we 
continue to urge both sides to move forward on the peace process 
state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
the last round of talks between the two sides held in portugal 
broke down portuguese officials have been suggesting that a more 
active us and soviet role might improve the chances for a 
peaceful settlement 
one example of the deep mistrust which has built up over the 
years has been angolas refusal to allow humanitarian food 
shipments to be delivered to hungry angolans in the southern part 
of the country some are in unitaheld territory while others are 
in areas under government control 
angolan officials are worried that the united states might try 
to slip weapons to its unita allies using the food shipments as a 
cover the director of the us office of foreign disaster 
assistance andrew natsios visited angola last week to try to work 
out an agreement but reportedly made no progress us officials 
believe tens of thousands of angolans face starvation unless food 
deliveries begin soon 
us officials said food deliveries would be in the hands of the 
international committee for the red cross they reject any 
suggestion that food shipments would be used as a means of arming 
the rebels 
mistrust also has been evident in the peace talks between the 
two countries unita wants recognition as a political entity before 
a cease fire but angola wants the sequence reversed each side 
blamed the other for the breakdown of the lisbon talks

the opposition ivorian popular front 
on monday chose a history professor as its presidential candidate 
in this west african nations first multiparty elections in 30 
years 
laurent gbagbo 45 has been the chief rival of president felix 
houphouetboigny since the nation won independence from france in 
1960 
the university professor won the candidacy with 98 percent of 
votes at his partys first congress which began sunday and ended 
early monday a party statement said 
he is the first candidate to declare for octobers balloting 
the first multiparty vote since houphouetboigny became president 
four decades ago and named his party the sole legal political 
organization in ivory coast 
twentyfive mostly leftleaning organizations have sprung up 
since the westernoriented ivorian leader was forced to legalize 
other political movements on april 30 
that move came after unprecedented unrest and riots demanding 
democracy and an end to the corruption that has helped impoverish 
this oncewealthy state 
authorities however often have refused to allow government 
opponents to hold rallies security forces twice this month used 
tear gas and truncheons to break up peaceful marches by opposition 
parties 
ivory coasts problems began with tumbling world prices for 
cocoa and coffee its main exports the government has been unable 
to pay its foreign debt for two years despite tax rates among the 
highest in the world 
attempts to raise taxes even higher and cut the salaries of 
government workers earlier this year fueled the worst unrest since 
independence forcing houphouetboigny to back down on some 
austerity measures

lawmakers looking for ways to stretch the 
medicaid dollar further considered proposals designed to cut 
spiraling growth in the price of prescription drugs 
over the past decade prescription drug prices have risen 152 
percent while consumer prices have gone up 58 percent sen david 
pryor dark sponsor of the proposals told a senate finance 
health subcommittee monday 
these unyielding and unfair prices have forced states to cut 
back on medicaid benefits reimbursement rates for physicians and 
the number of poor americans who can participate in the program he 
said 
in essence the drug manufacturers are holding our states 
hostage to their price increases pryor testified 
pryors legislation would require drug companies to give the 
medicaid program the same discounts it gives other volume buyers 
like the department of veterans affairs the defense department 
hospitals and hmos health management organizations they get 
discounts of as much as 60 percent 
medicaid drug costs for the current fiscal year are expected to 
be 44 billion two years ago the program paid 33 billion for 
prescription drugs 
medicaid drug reimbursement proposals have been raised in the 
current budget talks as a way to cut spending to meet grammrudman 
targets 
gerald mossinghoff president of the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association said pryors legislation is unnecessary 
currently 42 states representing more than 90 percent of the 
medicaid drug market are negotiating with drug companies for 
discounts and rebates he said 
the proposals also could be harmful to medicaid patients he 
said 
drug therapy in medicaid would be chosen by lowbid not by 
the medical judgment of the patients physician he said in 
testimony submitted to the panel the bill would thus result in 
secondclass medical care for medicaid recipients 
he also said the legislation amounted to price controls an idea 
he called inimical to this countrys freemarket economy 
sen bill bradley dnj said he was troubled by price 
controls as well as the possibility that restraints on the drug 
industry would be a disincentive to continued research and 
development of new drugs 
we should not treat that lightly bradley said 
gail wilensky head of the federal agency that administers 
medicaid also cautioned that we must use care to protect the 
thriving research and development associated with prescription 
drugs and we must be concerned for what is one of our most 
internationally cometitive industries

a consumer group on monday demanded that ford 
motor co recall 240000 ranger pickup trucks and bronco ii utility 
vehicles to fix gear shift levers that in some cases have broken 
off in the drivers hand 
fords offer of free repair of any broken shift lever if the 
truck is still under warranty is woefully inadequate said 
samuel cole vehicle safety staffer for the center for auto safety 
ford has designed a defect into these vehicles for which it 
must now take proper action and conduct a recall cole said 
with such a high failure rate it will only be a matter of time 
before we begin seeing accidents attributed to the gear shift 
defect 
ford spokeswoman joy stinson said the company did not consider 
the problem a safety hazard even if the lever breaks the vehicle 
remains in gear and the driver is able to pull off the road without 
losing control she said 
whatever gear it breaks in its driveable she said for 
that reason a safety recall is not warranted 
the national highway traffic safety administration launched an 
investigation of the gear lever problem last june 
ford provided the agency with a september 1988 internal report 
that disclosed 6473 gear shift lever failures on 1986 and 1987 
ranger pickups with manual transmissions made by mazda 
that translates into a failure rate of one in every 37 vehicles 
the center for auto safety said 
the bronco ii has the same transmission as the ranger ms 
stinson said 
ford began using an improved lever assembly with 1988 models 
the company informed the government july 16 it would provide an 
extended warranty service program in which owners would receive 
free repairs 
but the offer covered only trucks whose levers had actually 
broken and that were still covered by the companys sixyear 
60000mile warranty 
the center for auto safety in a letter to the government 
agency said the company should do more an inability to shift 
gears can result in loss of vehicle control and endanger lives it 
said 
we believe a defect is a defect and ford ought to own up 
to it and recall the vehicles cole said 
the center a private consumer advocacy organization founded by 
ralph nader urged the national highway traffic safety 
administration to order a recall of the ford trucks and investigate 
gear lever failures on mazda vehicles using the same transmission

president bushs galaxy of a thousand points 
of light is now a quarter full 
bush named his 250th daily point of light on monday linda 
warsaw a 17yearold san bernardino calif girl who founded 
kids against crime 
normally the honorees just get a letter signed by the president 
but ms warsaw also got a phone call from the president from the 
oval office 
she founded kids against crime in 1985 when she was 12 to 
teach children how to protect themselves she got the idea while 
volunteering with the victim witness assistance program in the san 
bernardino county district attorneys office the white house said 
teenage volunteers operate a hot line for youths to call when 
they need advice and support 
bush first spoke of the thousand points of light in his 
acceptance speech at the 1988 republican convention using it as a 
metaphor for all the things americans do individually and in 
groups to help fellow citizens 
last year he began naming daily points of light six days a week 
to encourage all americans to perform community service he plans 
eventually to name 1000

a bill letting regulators tap banks and 
savings institutions to shore up the dwindling government deposit 
insurance funds passed the house on monday 
by a voice vote the house favored removing the legal ceiling on 
insurance premiums levied by the federal deposit insurance corp 
the senate is scheduled to consider the measure later this month 
congressional leaders the bush administration and the fdic are 
supporting passage before congress adjourns early next month 
fdic chairman l william seidman said the agency did not plan to 
use the new power immediately but wanted it to meet any unforeseen 
emergency 
we dont see at this time we are going to change the premiums 
again however its an uncertain world and we thought wed be 
better equipped to handle things if we had the flexibility he 
said in a telephone interview 
the house action comes a week after the general accounting 
office congress auditing agency warned that bank failures 
produced by a recession could wipe out the fund protecting bank 
deposits requiring a taxpayer bailout 
the fund protecting savings and loans has already been 
bankrupted as part of negotiations on the 1991 budget congress 
and the administration are considering financing a second 
installment of the rescue begun last year 
the insurance premium bill is aimed at avoiding a similar 
bailout for banks according to its sponsor rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking committee it 
gives the fdic discretion to raise insurance premiums to whatever 
level it considers appropriate 
seidman has warned that the bank fund is under considerable 
stress and will probably experience its third consecutive loss 
this year as bank failures remain near a postdepression record 
that would bring fund reseves down to near 11 billion or 
between 50 cents and 60 cents for every 100 of insured deposits 
that is less than half the 125 reserve ratio considered safe 
the fdic insurance fund is teetering on the brink of 
insolvency warned rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the 
house banking financial institutions subcommittee 
in an attempt to bolster the fund the fdic later this month is 
expected to raise its 1991 bank premium from 12 cents per 100 of 
deposits to 195 cents it is the biggest increase allowed under 
current law 
gonzalez bill would scrap the 75 cent limit on annual 
increases and the 325 upper ceiling on the premium it would also 
remove provisions restricting the agency to raising the premium 
only once a year requiring instead that the fdic give 60 days 
notice of increases as needed 
rep chalmers wylie of ohio the senior republican on the 
banking committee said premiums may not have to be raised more 
than planned but said it would be irresponsible to taxpayers for 
congress not to give the fdic power to take swift action 
we are practicing an ounce of prevention before a pound of 
cure is needed he said 
kenneth guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america said industry groups were not 
lobbying against gonzalez bill 
but he said bankers worried that the fasttrack procedure 
congress is using to adopt the measure is creating a false 
impression that there is an emergency in the banking system 
with the premium increase already planned the fdic will have an 
additional 6 billion next year to pay for bank failures he said

the bush administration said monday it would 
look to international lending agencies to help alleviate mideast 
nations economic hardships stemming from the persian gulf crisis 
treasury deputy secretary david mulford said the question of 
financial assistance to support the trade embargo against iraq 
would be a primary topic at meetings which begin in washington over 
the weekend of the 151nation international monetary fund and its 
sister organization the world bank 
mulford earlier this month accompanied treasury secretary 
nicholas brady on a world trip to pass the hat among the allies for 
financial aid to support the trade embargo and to help defray the 
1 billionamonth costs of the us military buildup 
japan west germany saudi arabia and the exiled government of 
kuwait have made significant contributions to the 28 billion pool 
of money the administration is trying to gather 
mulford did not provide any specifics about what amounts of 
money the administration would be seeking from the international 
lending agencies but he said there were numerous needs that had to 
be addressed for the socalled frontline states of egypt jordan 
and turkey 
he said financial assistance was needed to cushion the shock 
from the loss of export markets because of the trade embargo 
higher oil prices and a tide of refugees from iraq and kuwait 
there is a very real crisis situation with immediate problems 
that need to be addressed mulford told reporters during a 
briefing 
mulford said egypt turkey and jordan needed an emergency 
transfusion of money without strings attached the administration 
previously has talked of the need for 35 billion for those 
countries before the end of the year with another 7 billion needed 
next year 
in addition to aid to the frontline states the imf and world 
bank were expected to address providing assistance to other poor 
nations hurt by such things as the rise in oil prices 
mulford said the issue of economic assistance would be taken up 
by finance ministers and central bankers of the worlds seven 
richest countries when they meet saturday in advance of the imf and 
world bank meetings 
the other countries japan west germany britain france 
italy and canada have been at the top of the list of nations to 
participate in bushs burdensharing campaign among allies 
in addition to the persian gulf the finance meetings will 
address the problem of economic difficulties facing the soviet 
union 
for the first time in history the soviets will be attending the 
annual meeting of the imf and world bank as special invitees a 
designation that will allow them to attend the full sessions of the 
two organizations but not the policymaking meetings of the imf 
interim committee and the joint imfworld bank development 
committee 
the soviet union has expressed an interest in joining the world 
bank and the imf and has been appealing for direct aid from the 
west to prop up the faltering soviet economy 
the administration has opposed direct aid until the soviets make 
bigger strides in developing a freemarket economy and mulford said 
that position had not changed

higher oil prices since the persian gulf 
crisis and global warming could give nuclear energy a boost 
according to delgates to an international conference on the atomic 
energy 
also at the opening session of the fiveday international atomic 
energy agency conference delegates chose a kuwaiti as one of the 
meetings vice presidents in essence rejecting iraqs claim over 
the oilwealthy emirate 
abdul hamid abdullah alhawadih was chosen to represent the 
middle east his nomination was endorsed by all delegations but 
iraqs which argued kuwait ceased to exist following baghdads 
aug 2 invasion and annexation of the emirate 
the international atomic energy agency the un group hosting 
the conference suspended cooperation with iraq in the wake of its 
attack on kuwait 
the conference is being attended by more than 300 delegates from 
most of the agencys 113 membernations 
during the opening session at viennas austria cente delegates 
and officials suggested the gulf crisis and global warming could 
give atomic energy a new lease on life if public confidence can be 
restored 
agency director general hans blix told delegates the crisis had 
reminded the world once again of the need to diversify energy 
sources 
outgoing conference president kunmo chung of south korea said 
nuclear power is being taken out of the closet like an old but 
usable suit 
in addition to rising oil prices blix said fears of global 
warming caused by generating energy from fossil fuels such as 
coal oil and gas has turned many countries to nuclear power 
currently 17 percent of the worlds electricity needs are met 
by nuclear power to match that output he said fossil fuel power 
stations would have to churn an extra 18 billion tons of carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere 
partly because of nuclear power reliance on oil to generate 
electricity in industrialized nations fell from 24 percent in 1974 
to 9 percent in 1986 blix said 
us deputy energy secretary w henson moore told the conference 
that prospects for restoring the nuclear option worldwide are 
good if we can restore public confidence in the operational 
safety of nuclear facilities 
however he acknowledged that was unlikely in the near future 
the united states which runs onequarter of the worlds nuclear 
stations will not increase nuclear electricity production over the 
next decade he said 
nuclear power is not growing in the united states for a very 
basic reason many people are afraid of accidents like 
chernobyl he said 
the 1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster which spread radioactive 
waste across europe focused international attention on the safety 
of sovietbuilt east european reactors 
thirtyone people died in the accident and some reports say 
hundreds more who worked to clean up the site have died in the 
ensuing four years 
according to blix former communist governments across eastern 
europe expanded nuclear programs without much public 
discussion 
but he said the advent of democracy in the east has now also put 
nuclear power there under just as much scrutiny and criticism as in 
the west 
the soviet union and the united states were expected to sign an 
agreement tuesday on nuclear waste disposal the soviets were to 
submit plans for a nuclear research center on the effects of 
radioactive contamination at chernobyl said spokesman hans 
friedrich meyer

had money but still had trouble finding anything to eat 
now our money is gone but they are feeding us god and the

tomatoes were stacked in the shade of a storage tent next to a camp 
clinic a halfdozen doctors with the jordanian red crescent 
supervised nurses from the order of the sacred heart bustling 
about in snowwhite habits and nike sneakers

1980s a decade of excess avarice and illusions in which the rich 
got richer while multitudes struggled to hold on to the very bottom 
rung of the social ladder kirkland said 
kirkland said the umws 10month strike against the pittston co 
at mines and coal processing plants in west virginia virginia and 
kentucky illustrates the power of a unified labor movement 
the umw rejoined the aflcio last year four decades after 
withdrawing and the two groups worked together on the pittston 
strike 
your struggle and your victory brought the entire labor 
movement together and for that the whole labor movement owes you a 
debt of gratitude kirkland told the miners 
the union declared victory in the bitter pittston strike but it 
was a costly win a financial disclosure form shows the unions net 
worth fell by 45 million in 1989 down to 126 million 
the umw is struggling to overturn 52 million in fines levied by 
a virginia judge because of the strike the union also faces more 
than 1 billion in lawsuits filed by companies idled by a fiveweek 
wildcat strike that began in sympathy with the pittston strikers 
kirkland also called health care a basic right but said we 
know that the collective bargaining process alone cannot solve the 
colossal health care crisis that is bankrupting workers and denying 
basic medical coverage to nearly onethird of our fellow 
americans 
health care is a chief issue in nearly every contract 
negotiation and now its the key factor for nearly fourfifths of 
all striking workers he said 
also monday umw president richard trumka blamed the persian 
gulf crisis on the lack of a federal energy policy which he said 
holds the united states hostage to an oilsoaked middle east 
dictator 
the only reason that characters like saddam hussein have any 
power at all is because of the oil they have oil we could have 
replaced years ago with coal mined in the united states and 
canada trumka said referring to the iraqi president 
the celebration of the oncepowerful unions centennial is 
dogged by financial and legal concerns 
during the nineday meeting delegates will be asked to give the 
international executive board the umws governing body authority 
to close or merge the 21 districts to help the union save money 
several of the largely autonomous districts are insolvent because 
of layoffs 
they also will decide whether to allow the governing body use of 
interest earnings from the 60 million strike fund to pay legal 
expenses and other costs associated with strikes currently the 
fund can be used only to pay benefits to strikers 
and the delegates will be asked to approve changes umw leaders 
say they need to deal with multinational corporations in the world

the saudi prince stopped himself as 
soon as he realized his lunch guest was taking notes 
can we do this how do you say off the record or on 
background the prince asked i do not want to be quoted by 
name 
the prince then launched into a series of questions about 
reporting ground rules ultimately deciding his conversation was on 
background he could not be identified by name but agreed to be 
cited as a saudi prince or senior saudi official 
by the time lunch was over the prince had approached several 
other reporters beginning each conversation with the greeting 
let us talk on background as his guests left the prince 
boasted to one i am a quick learner dont you think 
indeed many saudi officials in the government and military 
have proved fast learners in media relations although they have 
not always satisfied the more than 500 journalists who have visited 
saudi arabia in the past six weeks to cover the persian gulf 
crisis 
we wanted to please everybody and we are trying to please 
everybody a saudi diplomatic official said recently we are 
not perfect but i think we should get appreciation not 
complaints 
the most frequent complaints are that the saudis are slow to 
respond to requests saudis traditionally are not in as much of a 
rush as americans and other westerners 
we are dealing with two cultures here and you have to 
understand that the saudi official said we have nothing 
against you 
the saudis also are highly sensitive to unapproved photography 
and often insist that reporters accustomed to working alone travel 
with a government escort 
but they have improved their handling of media affairs 
a vast public affairs office has been established alongside the 
us militarys information bureau taking tips from the military 
the saudis now have a number of regular trips they organize fo 
reporters including one to see saudi and other arab troops near 
the kuwaiti border 
they are showing signs of trying to respond to requests more 
rapidly 
the latest example of this came late saturday night when word 
surfaced that iraqi troops had opened the kuwaiti border with saudi 
arabia and were letting kuwaitis leave their occupied homeland 
reporters wanted to go to the border right away but saudi 
officials refused to provide escorts until a governmentsponsored 
trip the following morning after several objections were raised 
the saudis called in a bus and headed north to the border 
reporters in tow at 240 am 
as they get used to their new role the saudis also are 
borrowing some tricks from us politicians 
saudi officials rarely speak for the record on any substantive 
matter when asked sensitive questions few saudis will give direct 
answers preferring instead to talk off the record or in sweeping 
generalities not unlike many policymakers in washington 
the current media crush in saudi arabia at times appears to pose 
difficult conflicts for the saudis who have shown an eagerness to 
reach out to the western world through its media but remain fearful 
of offending powerful conservative elements of the society 
a clear example of this scenario came during the discussion over 
whether to stage an immediate trip to the border area 
a halfdozen saudi officials publicly preached the same official 
line that there was no abnormal activity at the border but 
several privately told reporters there was indeed a rush of 
kuwaitis at the border and they were influential in arranging the 
quick trip to the border 
one official pulled aside an ap reporter just before the 
reporter headed to the border in a private car 
we are being told the official line is what you get to keep 
you guys from rushing up there the official said but about 
1000 have crossed and more are expected its busy up there but 
please dont say how you found that out i would be in big 
trouble

federal savings and loan bailout officials 
said monday they were canceling the muchpromoted international 
satellite auction of milliondollar properties inherited from 
bankrupt savings and loans 
l william seidman chairman of the resolution trust corp said 
the auction was canceled after the auction company of america 
which the agency had hired did not contribute to a joint fund 
promoting the event 
the group we contracted with couldnt fulfill their end of the 
deal seidman said in a telephone interview 
jim gall chairman of the miamibased auction company of 
america disputed seidman and accused the bailout agency of 
bungling the auction he said his firm has spent nearly 2 million 
over four months to prepare for the event about what it was 
obligated to spend 
the auction was to be held nov 15 in dallas texas with 
satellite hookups to bidders in nine other us cities as well as 
tokyo and london 
the rtc had hoped to sell 71 properties valued at 300 million 
the auction was a centerpiece for what the agency had billed as its 
great fall inventory clearance sale aimed at drastically 
slimming its ballooning inventory of sampl assets 
we hope to start over its going to slow us up a little 
but but i dont think its a major blow seidman said 
gall faulted the rtc for failing to set minimum prices for the 
properties and for withdrawing three properties from the auction 
list and selling them using other methods 
gall said potential buyers must have some assurance the 
properties will remain on the auction list or they will be 
unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on the environmental 
engineering and appraisal reports needed to offer an intelligent 
bid 
weve lost investor after investor gall said in a telephone 
interview 
he said a low or no minimum auction price also is needed to 
stimulate interest in an auction by holding out the prospect for a 
bargain he said 
to this day the agency hasnt put out reserve prices he 
said

britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher and president vaclav havel agreed monday on the need for 
tougher measures against iraq and havel indicated czechoslovakia 
may expel iraqi diplomats 
mrs thatcher making the first visit by a british leader to 
czechoslovakia since world war ii also said the european community 
should extend membership to the new democracies of eastern europe 
once they implement economic reforms 
but she was adamant that britain would give no largescale 
financial aid and that major investment was unlikely in 
czechslovakia until prague has established a private enterprise 
economy 
the visit has been billed by british and czechoslovak officials 
as ending decades of icy relations between prague and london after 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution ousted ruling communists in 
november 
mrs thatcher and havel addressed a joint news conference at 
prague castle after 2 hours of talks 
she said the expulsion by the european community of iraqi 
military attaches monday reflected shared anger at iraqs invasion 
last week of official residences or compounds of france and three 
other countries 
we naturally wished to act together over the outrage by iraqi 
troops said mrs thatcher whose government expelled 31 iraqi 
embassy personnel and students 
asked if czechoslovakia planned to join the west european action 
against iraqi diplomats havel said it does not depend only on 
me but it seems the situation is evolving in that direction 
the only difference between england and czechoslovakia is that 
we cant send our navy because we havent got one said 
havel but we are looking at a number of other possibilities on 
how to face this evil which is embodied by the aggressive regime 
of president hussein 
he referred to iraqs president saddam hussein whose troops 
overran kuwait on aug 2 and subsequently annexed the oilwealthy 
emirate 
havel said he had no major differences with mrs thatcher over 
her policy of restricting aid now largely to sending advisors to 
help along economic restructuring 
if you are going to get investment in we have got to be 
certain the old bureaucracy industry run by government has 
gone mrs thatcher said in an interview published monday in a 
prague newspaper lidove noviny 
mrs thatcher who arrived sunday with her husband denis at 
the start of the threenation european tour that will also take her 
to hungary and switzerland was greeted at the ornate hradcany 
castle by a guard of honor 
havel playwright and onetime dissident and the british 
conservative party leader stood side by side in the autumn sunshine 
as a military band played the national anthems and a jaunty 
welcoming march 
earlier mrs thatcher warned czechs and slovaks not to allow 
ethnic differences mar the democracy they have won after decades of 
communist rule 
it would be a great tragedy if people merely used freedom to 
emphasize differences a british official quoted mrs thatcher as 
telling leaders of the czech republic 
the new federal government and the countrys czech and slovak 
republics are trying to draw up new constitutions that will satisfy 
calls for less centralized power 
before meeting havel mrs thatcher swept through this historic 
capital in an armoredplated jaguar to visit the citys jewish 
cemetery and a museum commemorating the victims of nazi 
concentration camps in world war ii 
she is to address the czechoslovak parliament tuesday before 
flying to bratislava in the slovak republic

angolas marxist government does not 
want united states or soviet observers at the next round of peace 
talks with unita rebels the official angolan news agency said 
monday 
the portuguese government acting as unofficial mediator in the 
conflict had asked moscow and washington to send observers to the 
talks slated for sept 24 in portugal 
the move was to pressure the angolan foes into a compromise to 
end the 15yearold civil war portuguese officials said 
the united states is believed to channel more than 50 million 
in aid to unita yearly the soviet union backs angolas government 
the last round of talks in lisbon last month stumbled over a 
unita demand that the government recognize the group as a 
legitimate political party before a ceasefire 
both the united states and the soviet union have indicated they 
would send observers if both government and rebels wished 
but venancio de moura angolan viceminister for foreign 
relations said saturday in namibia that such participation would 
not be useful angolas angop news agency reported 
on the contrary we consider it premature de moura was 
quoted as saying 
he said a truce could be reached this month if unita dropped its 
demands for explicit political recognition 
unita spokesmen said recently the rebels had rejected a 
government proposal offering unita special status but falling 
short of full political recognition he said however the rebels 
would make it easier for the government to recognize them during 
the next round of talks 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos also said recently the 
rebels have intensified their attacks making it difficult to 
build a climate favorable to national reconciliation angop 
reported 
unita fighters said last week they would scale back attacks in 
response to a plea from the organization of african unity 
unita the national union for the total independence of angola 
has been fighting the government since angola gained independence 
from portugal in 1975

up authorities said monday 
the towns 345 residents were evacuated when one derailed car 
began leaking highly corrosive nitric acid some of which 
evaporated to form a cloud over the town said gary talley of the 
state office of emergency services 
the car is upside down and it looks like the leak is on the 
underside talley said 
until the all of the chemical is drained and either evaporates 
or is neutralized there is little authorities can do but secure the 
area he said 
were gearing up for two to three days talley said he said 
that meant the earliest residents could return home was late 
tuesday afternoon

scores of timber industry workers asked 
congressmen monday not to destroy jobs by sharply reduced timber 
cutting while environmentalists lobbied for legislation to protect 
the northwests ancient forests 
im scared for my family said judy marr who runs a small 
logging company in northwestern washington and said she was worried 
about legislation that would reduce timber harvests 
for us its not a weekend hike or a walk every five years for 
us its an everyday lifestyle 
ms marr was among about 200 loggers mill workers and community 
leaders from oregon and washington state who sought out members of 
congress to plead that they keep the plight of timber workers in 
mind when considering legislation that would reduce timber cutting 
legislation that would ban logging on 63 million acres 
including about 27 million acres currently open to timber harvests 
is expected to be considered by the house interior committee later 
this week 
the push to protect northwest forests intensified this summer 
when the spotted owl was declared protected under the endangered 
species act scientists say the only way to ensure the owls 
survival is to restricting logging 
a federal task force has been trying to work out ways to protect 
the owl but still minimize the economic impact on timber workers 
rep denny smith rore said white house chief of staff john 
sununu has told him that there is little liklihood that 
environmental and economic considerations could be balanced in the 
spotted owl deliberations without congress changing the endangered 
species act 
he said sununu urged that congress change the law but smith as 
well as sen mark hatfield rore said they do not believe there 
are enough votes in congress to do that 
valerie johnson leader of the oregon lands coalition said the 
northwest is the latest region to fall victim to overzealous 
environmental legislation that is causing social havoc and human 
suffering among timber industry workers and related businesses 
we are all being told that americans dont need us any more 
she said 
meanwhile some 500 environmentalists also fanned out among the 
congressional offices to lobby against legislation they said would 
further destroy the northwests dwindling oldgrowth forests 
frances hunt of the national wildlife federation said the 
economic plight of the timber workers was wrongly being blamed on 
conservationists attempts to preserve the ancient forests 
we have already lost 90 percent of the oldgrowth ecosystem 
it is not the last 10 percent that is putting them out of work it 
is the 90 percent that was cut before she said 
the timber workers gave smith a petition with 40000 signatures 
from families concerned about their future and asked congressmen to 
weigh both the scientific evidence and the social price tag 
when considering such issues as the protection of the threatened 
spotted owl 
we didnt come to washington to ask congress for a handout we 
came to ask for the opportunity to continue working said doug 
robertson a county commissioner from heavily timberdependent 
roseburg ore contested bid for reelection said the northwest 
residents face an uphill battle

president bush said monday that new yorkers 
alarmed about crime should lean on congress to enact an 
administration bill to stiffen penalties against criminals and 
build more jail cells 
at a news conference bush said that soft treatment of the 
criminal sends exactly the wrong signal to those embattled 
citizens 
id like to see our crime bill pass he said i think that 
would send a good message to the policemen on the streets of new 
york that we plan to back them up more 
bushs anticrime bill has been stalled in congress since last 
year its provisions include the death penalty for drug 
kingpins on that point bush said weve got a difference with 
some in new york on that one he did not cite any opponents by 
name 
new york has been stunned by random shootings whose victims have 
included innocent children and other bystanders last month a 
22yearold visitor from utah brian watkins was stabbed to death 
when he tried to protect his parents during a subway mugging 
on another subject bush criticized the tactics of some aids 
activists singling out protestors who disrupted a recent speech by 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan at an aids 
conference in san francisco 
i must say some of the excesses of those groups does not help 
the cause the president said i had a lot of mail saying 
people were quite embarrassed by that 
speaking about the economy bush said i dont think theres a 
financial crisis i think the economys growth is slow i do not 
think that nationally were in a recession 
he acknowledged that new england states with heavy unemployment 
and other economic problems were undergoing a very difficult 
situation 
he said other areas of the country have gone through similar 
regional downturns i think the best thing the federal 
government can do is to get these interest rates down and to adopt 
growth incentives so that people will continue to create jobs

the house by a 3680 vote gave final approval 
monday to legislation that would give free mailing privileges to 
us troops deployed in the persian gulf 
the legislation now goes to president bush the senate approved 
the measure by voice vote last week 
under current law free mailing privileges are extended to 
members of the armed forces engaged in hostilities this 
legislation would extend free mail to participants in operation 
desert shield including those aboard ships 
the free postage would apply to cards letters and audio 
cassettes 
members of a recent congressional delegation visiting saudi 
arabia heard troops complain they were unable to purchase stamps 
and that stamps brought from home were made unusable by the extreme 
heat 
the congressional budget office estimated that the measure would 
cost between 6 million and 8 million in fiscal 1991 money that 
the defense department would pay to the postal service 
the postal service sought to institute the free mail last week 
but the pentagon refused to begin the program without legislation

iraq on monday rejected a proposed visit 
to iraq and kuwait by the secretarygenerals envoy for 
humanitarian aid and kuwaits ambassador filed a protest against 
alleged iraqi atrocities 
prince sadruddin aga khan of pakistan had been appointed by 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to oversee un aid in 
the gulf crisis perez de cuellar appealed last week to iraq to 
allow aga khan to make a visit to determine food and medicine needs 
especially those of foreigners 
emerging from a visit with perez de cuellar ambassador abdul 
amir alanbari said iraq rejected the visit as well as the 
security councils call for aid to be delivered to iraq and kuwait 
through noniraqi organizations 
iraq is the cradle of civilization and not just another poor 
country alanbari said describing the un plan for food 
deliveries as humiliating 
meanwhile the security councils sanction commmitte recommended 
the international community provide aid to jordan which is heavily 
dependent on iraqi commerce 
jordan is one of 10 nations including india sri lanka 
bulgaria and the philippines which have requested relief from the 
sweeping un trade embargo intended to compel the withdrawal of 
iraqi forces from kuwait 
the five permanent security council members the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union met monday to discuss 
the possible expansion of enforcement measures against iraq to 
include an aerial blockade and sanctions against countries that 
violate the embargo 
the existing embargo already covers air traffic in theory but 
the security council has only permitted the use of force to halt 
maritime traffic to allow ships to be stopped and boarded and 
their cargoes inspected 
the united states britain france support the new restrictions 
but china and the soviet union were said to be opposed to the 
aerial blockade 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
expected the security council this week to adopt a resolution that 
would take punitive measures against violators of the embargo 
an air blockade is considered risky because halting planes is 
difficult without the use of deadly force numerous international 
conventions protect civil aviation 
meanwhile kuwaiti ambassador mohammad abulhassan said in a 
letter to perez de cuellar that the entire population of kuwait 
including third country nationals is being subjected to a reign of 
terror systematically planned and relentlessly pursued by the 
iraqi occupiers 
iraqi criminal practices are being stepped up with the 
sinister objected of making life under occupation so inteolerable 
that the population is forced out in order to alter the 
demographics of kuwait the letter said 
some kuwaitis have speculated saddam hussein wants to repopulate 
kuwait with iraqis an estimated 300000 of kuwaits native 
population of 570000 have fled since iraq invaded on aug 2 
abulhassan also wrote that many kuwaitis have been arrested for 
refusing to collaborate with occupation forces and some of them 
are being subjected to all sorts of intimidation and physical 
torture 
in the presence of a large crowd iraqi troops shot to death 
mubarak faleh al note the chairman of a cooperative society 
abulhassan said when he refused to hang a portrait of saddam and 
removed one of the emir of kuwait

about 800 indians marched into the 
capital monday ending a 470mile trek to draw attention to their 
anguish over the deforestation of the amazon rainforest where they 
reside 
the indians were greeted by tens of thousands of city residents 
who poured into the streets of la paz to greet them 
the indians including women and children made the 32day trek 
from the jungle lowlands to la paz to demand the return of 750000 
acres of land deeded to lumber companies la paz is 13000 feet 
above sea level 
at a 14500 foothigh crossing 25 miles outside la paz aymara 
indians from the highlands met the marchers and sacrificed a llama 
to the aymara earth goddess in a ceremony dating to precolombian 
times 
aymara leaders gave the marchers a symbolic key to la paz and 
accompanied the rainforest indians on the last stretch of their 
march 
the march which involves various small indian tribes has 
captured the attention of bolivians by exposing the misery of the 
oftneglected tribes from the isolated lowlands of interior 
bolivia 
the march is not against anybody but a call for bolivians to 
pay attention to their plight president jaime paz zamora said 
during a meeting with the indians last week as they began their 
march toward la paz

of logging companies has taken out adds in local papers saying 
loggers were not damaging the environment loggers also argue that 
should the government back away from the logging contracts it would 
harm foreign investment in bolivia

supreme court nominee david h souter said 
monday at his confirmation hearings that letting states outlaw 
abortion might cast doubts on other privacy rights senators told 
souter testifying on his 51st birthday that his confirmation was 
virtually assured 
during a third and final day of senate judiciary committee 
questioning on controversial issues he would face as a justice 
souter said he opposes a judicial ban on the death penalty 
in a final statement to the committee souter said you have 
treated me with such consummate fairness that on whatever court i 
may sit i hope i will do as well 
souter was followed to the witness table by an american bar 
association committee which previously announced that it had given 
him its highest rating well qualified 
more than two dozen other witnesses including the woman whose 
challenge to a texas abortion law led to the supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion were scheduled to begin testimony tuesday 
souter continued to dodge questions concerning his views on 
abortion but did address the privacyrights issue and said his 
personal feelings on abortion would not keep him from taking part 
in supreme court decisions on the subject 
a lot of people have the feeling that your confirmation 
process is over sen arlen specter rpa told souter at one 
point 
sen dennis deconcini dariz told the new hampshire judge 
i believe you will be confirmed 
sens orrin hatch rutah and charles grassley riowa also 
voiced confidence about souters success but committee chairman 
joseph biden ddel said some senators including himself remain 
undecided 
the 14member committee will send its recommendation to the full 
senate for a confirmation vote biden indicated might come in two 
or three weeks 
asked whether he believes the death penalty violates the 
constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment souter said 
i think that would be an insupportable constitutional conclusion 
that is an opinion i could not join 
retired supreme court justice william j brennan whom souter 
was picked by president bush to replace held such a view the only 
high court justice remaining who opposes capital punishment under 
all circumstances is thurgood marshall 
but the court now is far more closely divided on its 1973 
abortionlegalizing decision roe vs wade and souter again monday 
turned aside questions about his personal views on that topic 
pressed by sen patrick leahy dvt souter did say his 
personal beliefs would not keep him from participating in abortion 
decisions on the high court 
he also said a successful attack on roe vs wade might call 
into question prior privacy rulings 
the comment could be significant suggesting that a concern for 
other privacy rights might make souter less willing to vote to 
overturn the 1973 ruling in previous testimony souter told the 
committee he believes married women have a fundamental privacy 
right to use contraceptives 
souter also said overturning roe vs wade would make abortion 
a matter for legislative judgment as individual states would 
have to decide whether to outlaw or stringently regulate abortions 
on another subject souter said he made a mistake by not 
insisting that new hampshire return 74000 contributed to the 
state by the owner of the seabrook nuclear power plant for law 
enforcement costs connected with antinuclear demonstrations 
questioned by sen howard metzenbaum dohio souter said giving 
the money back to the public service co would have been an 
appropriate position to take i wish i had taken it 
he said acceptance of the contribution gave rise to the 
appearance that justice can be deflected by this 
metzenbaum also brought up the supreme court decision earlier 
this year striking down a federal ban on burning the american flag 
the senator asked is the court obligated to enforce individual 
rights no matter how unpopular the cause 
souter replied if that were not the case there would be no 
need to have a bill or rights 
the nominee refused several invitations by grassley to criticize 
past supreme court rulings that expanded the rights of criminal 
suspects 
about the landmark 1966 ruling in miranda vs arizona that 
required police to warn suspects of their rights before questioning 
them souter said the ruling did not create a new right but merely 
set down procedural guidelines for protecting a right 
sen paul simon dill reminded souter of an answer robert h 
bork gave during the confirmation hearings that preceded the 
senates rejection in 1987 of borks supreme court nomination 
taking issue with borks view that adding to an individuals 
rights necessarily diminishes the rights of someone else simon 
said he believes adding to one persons rights enhances the rights 
of all 
souter agreed with simon saying id rather have a right to 
do something than a right to stop someone else 
simon replied i like that answer 
when sen alan simpson rwyo asked souter how he had changed 
over the past 25 years the judge said he had learned something 
of the wisdom of benjamin franklins advice to join with me in 
doubting for a minute your own infallibility 
simpson said i like that

president bush said monday he would veto a 
bill due for a vote in the house to sharply limit imports of 
textiles apparel and shoes 
the bill is a threat to the stability of the world trading 
system and is completely contrary to the economic commercial and 
political interests of the united states bush said in a letter 
to congressional leaders 
this legislation would seriously restrict textile and footwear 
imports and violate international trade rules the president 
added it represents the worst form of economic policy for 
america one based upon the mistaken belief that less trade 
throughout the world will somehow save american jobs and enhance 
our prosperity 
the house was to vote on the measure tuesday 
the bill would restrict textile imports levels to a 1 percent 
increase over the previous year 
shoe import quotas would be permanently fixed at 1980 levels and 
would cover 38 product categories applying to all countries except 
canada and israel 
meanwhile a spokesman for 12 major european countries warned 
that passing a bill to limit us imports could bring failure to 
more than four years of worldwide talks to increase trade and to 
cut subsidies to farmers 
andreas van agt ambassador of the european economic community 
called it this draconian provision he wrote house speaker 
thomas s foley that he wanted to explain why the 12 governments in 
the community oppose the bill 
indeed the passage of such legislation would be tantamount to 
eliminating all prospects of progress in this area and even worse 
will jeopardize negotiations not just in textiles but in all other 
areas covered by the round as well he said

south africa would sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty if other nations in the southern 
african region also agreed to sign such a document foreign affairs 
minister pik botha said monday 
he said officials have discussed the issue with the united 
states soviet union and britain botha cited reduced tensions 
between the superpowers as a reason for the willingness to join the 
pact 
the south african government is prepared to accede to the 
treaty in the context of an equal commitment by other states in the 
southern african region botha said in a statement 
discussions on creating a nuclearfree zone in southern africa 
had been held with neighboring countries he said 
such a move would further remove suspicions and should 
strengthen the economic and geographical cohesion of the region 
botha said 
it was the latest in a series of signals that south africa has 
greater cooperation with its neighbors among the most vocal 
critics of the apartheid system of racial segregation and white 
dominance 
during the 1980s south africa supported rebel movements 
fighting leftist governments in mozambique and angola however 
south africa has signed peace treaties with both countries and is 
improving diplomatic and trade contacts with other countries 
throughout africa 
south africa has previously refused to sign the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty it has one nuclear power plant near cape 
town and is a major uranium exporting country 
it has refused to say if it has nuclear weapons but is widely 
believed to have the ability to make them 
the treaty calls on countries with nuclear weapons to refrain 
from selling them or the technology to other countries those 
without nuclear weapons agree to refrain from purchasing them or 
the technology to make them more than 130 countries have signed 
the treaty

the state department has placed guatemala 
on a list of major drug trafficking countries and further us aid 
will be conditioned on how hard it fights the narcotics problem a 
diplomat said monday 
us officials say at least 4000 acres in guatemalas rugged 
western mountains were planted with opium poppies last year the 
region yields three or four 16metric ton harvests a year said to 
be enough heroin to supply the annual needs of each addict in the 
united states 
the country is also a major transshipment point for cocaine 
fourteen tons were seized in guatemala this year compared to 4 
tons last year us embassy spokesman james dickmeyer said in an 
interview 
guatemala has been overwhelmed by drugs thats why it has 
been put on the list dickmeyer said 
any nation that produces more than 5 tons of opium paste 
automatically goes on the drug watch list which currently includes 
24 nations 10 in latin america and the caribbean and 14 in asia 
and the mideast 
every march the administration gives congress a scorecard 
on each countrys efforts to curb drug production trafficking or 
moneylaundering 
if the administration fails to certify guatemala is cooperating 
in the war on drugs it could lose half its us aid 
dickmeyer said guatemala is not likely to have problems with 
certification because it is cooperating with the drug enforcement 
administration 
when they pass information to guatemala that something is 
coming through the shipment usually gets busted dickmeyer said 
us aid to guatemala in the current fiscal year totalled 1213 
million 118 in economic aid and 33 million in military aid it 
included more than 1 million earmarked primarily for a us 
spraying program against opium fields 
the military which has dominated guatemala for decades has not 
been involved in fighting poppy cultivation officials say it has 
left enforcement to the undermanned treasury police 
some prominent guatemalan officials have been linked to drug 
trafficking in recent years us officials say drug operations 
thrive in a climate of corruption that has grown since christian 
democrat vinicio cerezo became president in 1986 
polls indicate the christian democrats will lose the 
presidential elections set for november

up to 2 million soviet immigrants could arrive 
in israel by the end of 1995 and the government will need hundreds 
of millions of dollars in extra aid to absorb them a senior 
official said monday 
the projection by simcha dinitz chairman of the 
quasigovernmental jewish agency would mean an increase of nearly 
45 percent in israels current population of 45 million 
prime minister yitzhak shamir on monday welcomed a planeload of 
soviet immigrants praising the influx as a boost to the strength 
of the jewish state 
these immigrants are more important than weapons shamir 
told reporters at bengurion international airport near tel aviv 
dinitzs estimate was the highest yet for a massive influx of 
soviets that started last year the flow of immigrants has 
consistently exceeded expectations and outrun plans for housing and 
employment for the new arrivals 
it is a most revolutionary thing dinitz told a news 
conference in his office i know of no other society going 
through such a massive absorption process 
earlier this month shamir said a million soviets were expected 
within the decade 
dinitz suggested shamir gave a conservative estimate out of 
concern the flow could be stemmed by the crisis in the persian gulf 
and pressures from arab countries on the soviets to halt the 
immigration 
all these fears of interference with immigration have proven 
unfounded it didnt happen with each passing month we are seeing 
an increase dinitz said dinitz said israel expected the total 
of soviet newcomers to reach 1 million by the end of 1992 
he said this meant israels population would grow by nearly 25 
percent 
we have a potential of another million over six years 
dinitz said he added that the jewish agency was already processing 
applications beyond the 1 million mark 
the jewish agency oversees immigration and jewish fundraising 
abroad 
the pace of immigration has already risen dramatically in the 
last few months dinitz noted this months total through sept 16 
was 9864 soviets dinitz said 
dinitz said the pressure to handle the arrivals was so great the 
government was considering receiving 3500 soviet immigrants over 
rosh hashanah the jewish new year holiday from wednesday through 
saturday this is despite rabbis complaints about allowing travel 
on holy days 
most soviet jews say they are leaving their country because of 
increasing evidence of antisemitism and economic instability in 
the soviet union the flow of jews to israel also has been spurred 
by more liberal soviet exit policies and tighter us immigration 
rules 
dinitz said israel had to take drastic comprehensive steps 
to absorb the newcomers in an economy already troubled by 
doubledigit inflation and a recession 
officials have estimated at least 30 billion would be needed to 
take in 1 million immigrants israels gross national product for 
1988 the last year available was 335 billion israel has so far 
budgeted only about 23 billion over the next three years and 
world jewry has pledged another 740 million 
dinitz indicated jewish leaders abroad were already increasing 
their contributions and that a record of 650 million was received 
this year but he said more would be needed 
israel is already hard put to handle the immigrants state tv 
reported last week that only 8000 of about 100000 newcomers this 
year had found jobs unemployment excluding the immigrants has hit 
10 percent 
housing minister ariel sharon told the cabinet on sunday that 
construction was under way for only 5000 of 45000 housing units 
approved earlier this year the yediot ahronot daily said

monday to expel iraqi military aides and restrict the movement of 
iraqs diplomats in retaliation for raids on foreign diplomatic 
compounds in kuwait 
britain ousted eight members of the iraqi embassy and ordered 
the deportation of 23 other iraqi citizens west germany gave 
military aides at the iraqi embassy in bonn 48 hours to leave the 
country 
and italy announced a previous expulsion order would apply to 11 
employees in the iraqi military attaches office 
belgium told iraqi diplomats they could travel no farther than 
18 miles from brussels and italy restricted them to an area within 
18 miles of rome west germany limited their travel to bonn and the 
city airport and the dutch demanded written requests from iraqi 
officials for travel outside the hague 
british prime minister margaret thatcher on an official visit 
to czechoslovakia said britain expelled the iraqis in order to 
support france and other countries whose residences were attacked 
by iraqi troops in kuwait 
after the exceptionally scandalous behavior against the 
diplomatic missions something had to happen dutch foreign 
minister hans van den broek said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has to see he is in a nowin 
situation he said 
italys foreign minister gianna de michelis said he hoped the 
european reaction would show saddam an escalation of tensions 
will not help but will strengthen our solidarity in enforcing 
the embargo the united nations imposed an economic embargo on 
iraq after its invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
in a final statement the foreign ministers of the 12 common 
market nations urged iraq to realize the suicidal character of 
its behavior toward the international community 
on sunday the un security council condemned the iraqi raids 
on the french belgian dutch and canadian embassy compounds in 
kuwait france has since expelled 29 iraqis 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said there was support 
among the foreign ministers for an air blockade of iraq but he 
said it was important to get backing from the security council for 
such a move 
the officials refused however to set a price tag on the amount 
of aid they will give to the states of egypt turkey and jordan to 
help offset the economic impact of the persian gulf crisis 
at an informal meeting earlier this month the ministers 
promised the three countries 2 billion through the end of 1991 to 
compensate them for lost trade with iraq but on monday they put 
off a formal decision on the amount of aid 
the community is determined to assist these countries in the 
sacrifices imposed on them by the present international crisis 
the ministers said 
they said they would look as a matter of urgency at a 
proposal to channel 2 billion to the countries but they asked for 
updated estimates on the amount of help the countries need and the 
contributions already made by community and other nations 
hurd taking note of fresh pledges of military and financial 
support for the usled operation in the gulf said europeans 
are increasingly putting our forces and our money where our mouth 
is

a buildup of flammable hydrogen 
vapor in the engine compartment monday forced nasa to cancel a 
fourth attempt at launching the space shuttle columbia 
nasa postponed columbias astronomy mission until after a 
higherpriority flight of the shuttle discovery in october 
the leak appeared as the shuttles huge external fuel tank was 
being filled it was detected a few minutes after supercooled 
liquid hydrogen fuel began flowing into the tank at a fast fill 
rate of 8400 gallons per minute the same point where buildup 
caused nasa to cancel two previous launches 
at one point the vapor reached levels more than triple nasas 
limit 
the shuttle was to have been launched at 128 am edt tuesday 
the mood is pretty depressing said keith hudkins chief of 
the orbiter division after all summer trying to chase these 
leaks down ill tell you this weve had all the experts 
working very long hours and they are experts its just a very 
difficult problem 
after the launch was called off engineers scrambled to find the 
cause of the problem they monitored sensors in the engine 
compartment long after the filling operation was stopped 
robert crippen director of the shuttle program said nasa would 
conduct a tanking test on sunday at the earliest in an attempt to 
pinpoint the source of the leak television cameras will be mounted 
in the crowded compartment he said 
its obviously a leak we cannot pick up crippen said 
he said the leak appears only when the liquid hydrogen fuel is 
at its coldest minus 423 degrees fahrenheit as it warms a few 
degrees while the shuttle sits the leak stops crippen said 
columbia is the oldest ship in the fleet it has been flying 
since 1981 and has nine missions on its flight log 
at a briefing earlier in the day william lenoir the head of 
nasas space flight program expressed the hope the leaks had been 
found and fixed two leaky components were replaced last week 
were going to keep trying until we get it right he said 
in past filling operations nasa said it would stop fueling if 
there were more than 600 parts of highly flammable hydrogen vapor 
in a million parts of air but on monday lenoir said that the 
bottom line would be raised to 1000 parts per million the mission 
was called off on monday when concentrations reached 3300 ppm 
on sept 5 when the last filling operation also ended in a 
scrub sensors recorded 6500 ppm on the attempt before that may 
29 hydrogen leaked in two places from the large pipe that 
connects the ship with its tank and in the aft compartment where 
the engines are 
the pipe was replaced and there was no leak in that area on 
monday or during the last fueling 
hydrogen vapor could burst into flame if the concentration is 
too high 
monday afternoon began badly for the launch team the start of 
the filling operation was delayed 53 minutes because of lightning 
within six miles of the launch pad 
columbia was to have carried seven astronauts into space and the 
150 million astro observatory 
it gets a little harder each time but the science is there 
and we want to go after it said mission scientist ted gull 
the national aeronautics and space administration hasnt 
launched a shuttle since april when discovery carried the flawed 
hubble space telescope into orbit discovery now sits on a launch 
pad 1 miles away from columbia discovery is scheduled to launch 
around oct 8 carrying a satellite to study the sun 
atlantis meanwhile is in the hangar undergoing repairs for 
hydrogen leaks that were detected over the summer 
the astro mission originally was scheduled for march 1986 but 
was delayed indefinitely following the challenger explosion two 
months earlier 
veteran astronaut vance brand is to command the mission at 59 
he would be the oldest person to fly in space 
the crew includes four astronomers who would have operated 
astros three ultraviolet telescopes in nonstop shifts during the 
nine to 10day mission an xray telescope responsible for 
columbias second failed launch attempt was to be managed by 
computer commands sent from the ground

the test of any great role is in the different 
ways it can be performed and still be successful 
a fine example is now on view at broadways st james theater 
where the revival of gypsy has a new rose that quintessential 
stage mother in the person of linda lavin last seen here three 
years ago in neil simons broadway bound 
lavin plays rose the mother of stripper gypsy rose lee as a 
twitchy street fighter tough uncompromising and more than a tad 
neurotic 
its a thoroughly original even dangerous performance 
different from the portraits provided by the other formidable women 
ethel merman angela lansbury and tyne daly who have played the 
role on broadway over the last 30 years and its an amazing 
demonstration of what an actress who has thought out the role from 
a very specific point of view can do 
lavin is willing to let the audience dislike this rose as she 
forces daughters june and then louise into the show business 
careers she never had 
its a credit to lavins harsh performance that she refuses to 
soften the woman everything her rose wants she wants on her terms 
only whether its the love of that sweet candy salesman turned 
manager herbie or a career for her awkward alsoran daughter 
louise 
watch her grim determination as she prepares sweet little louise 
for her debut as a burlesque queen the concentration is awesome as 
rose contemplates finally making her daughter a star 
lavins fierceness extends to her singing the woman knows how 
to handle a theater song long before she was televisions 
alice she had a steady career in broadway musicals her 
roses turn is a frenzied cry for recognition for what she 
did 
whats amazing is that lavin manages to evoke a sense of pity 
for this woman making the ending moving and a bit teary as mother 
and daughter come to a sort of uneasy truce at the final curtain 
the rest of the cast has improved in the 10 months the show has 
been playing on broadway jonathan hadary remains the definitive 
herbie putting a human face on what is often a cipher of a 
character christen tassin is still hilariously horrific as baby 
june the worlds most obnoxious child star and crista moore has 
grown immeasurably in the title role of the ugly duckling who 
becomes a very sexy swan 
the score by jule styne and stephen sondheim is as brassy and 
classy as ever and arthur laurents book is a model of what 
musical comedy writing should be and now theres lavin mama rose 
has never been as unappealing and as fascinating 
 
falsettoland william finns musical about facing big city 
life in the age of aids keeps getting better and better in its 
recent transfer to offbroadways lucille lortel theater for an 
openended run the musical remains funny and poignant 
on repeated viewings two things stand out the melodic 
inventiveness of finns score and the rapidfire staging of 
director james lapine this is a musical that never stops for 70 
fast minutes the story of marvin and how he copes with his sons 
bar mitzvah and his lovers fatal illness never lets down 
musically or emotionally 
the cast headed by the superb michael rupert and stephen 
bogardus is now even more comfortable in the show its odd to 
think of a musical about aids as exhilarating and not depressing 
but falsettoland turns the act of growing up and coming to 
terms with oneself into an affecting piece of musical theater

eritrean rebels claimed they killed or 
wounded nearly 3000 soldiers in four days of fighting that the

its troops 
the eritrean peoples liberation front which appears this year

wednesday in a speech marking the 1974 coup that toppled the late 
emperor haile selassie and brought mengistu to power 
mengistu said the eritreans were intensifying their war and 
government troops were paying enormous sacrifices to uphold the 
entity of the motherland 
mengistu appealed to the rebels to resume the peace talks they 
held with the government last year 
ethiopias army is made up largely of forcibly recruited 
youngsters they face an experienced guerrilla force considered by 
many the best in the world the soviet union has halted military 
aid to ethiopia after years of support 
the eritreans control most of the countryside in eritrea 
province in february after their largest offensive ever they 
captured the red sea port of massawa and cut all ground routes to 
asmara from the capital addis ababa 
the government is also fighting a smaller guerrilla group the 
tigre peoples liberation front which controls tigre province on 
the southern border with eritrea 
the tigreans are seeking to oust mengistu and establish a 
government patterned after that of albania the last of the 
hardline marxist states in eastern europe 
although their aims differ the tigreans and the eritreans 
usually conduct joint offensives

vietnams communist party chief nguyen 
van linh and two other vietnamese leaders secretly visited china 
this month for talks on improving relations thai officials and 
western diplomats said monday 
it is believed to have been the highestlevel vietnamese 
delegation to visit beijing since the two countries fought a border 
war in 1979 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
delegation that met with chinese premier li peng included linh 
vietnamese prime minister do muoi and pham van dong a former prime 
minister who is a senior advisor 
in early may japanese officials had quoted linh as saying he 
was ready to go to china to normalize relations if the chinese 
invited him 
in beijing an official of the vietnamese embassy on monday 
denied such a visit took place the chinese foreign ministry 
refused to comment 
a thai government official said the two sides had met to discuss 
what positions they would take at the cambodian peace talks in 
jakarta indonesia 
the talks last week produced a breakthrough agreement in which 
the cambodian factions joined to form a supreme national council 
and accepted a un security council plan as the basis for a 
settlement the first session of the supreme national council 
convened monday in bangkok 
vietnam and china have decreased border attacks the past two 
years their deputy foreign ministers have held several rounds of 
talks on the war between the vietnameseinstalled government and 
chinesebacked guerrillas in cambodia 
china has said the cambodian conflict must be resolved before 
relations with vietnam can be normalized 
a western diplomat in bangkok said monday the two countries were 
eager to get past the cambodia issue so they could increase 
economic ties and trade which has boomed since the border was 
opened two years ago 
the communist neighbors agree that the basis for a settlement 
should be the comprehensive peace plan adopted aug 28 by the un 
security council the plan calls for heavy un involvement in 
cambodia before elections 
they appear to still disagree however over how much power the 
government and the guerrillas should have in this interim period

two pictures of the winery worker 
accused in a homicidal rampage emerged in court monday one a 
brutal killer who planned nine slayings and accomplished seven the 
other a heartbroken drunk fogged by psychotic depression 
the prosecutor and defense attorney presented the contrasting 
views in opening statements at the murder trial of ramon salicido 
who has admitted killing his wife two of their three children his 
motherinlaw her two young daughters and a coworker 
the evidence will show that ramon salcido targeted nine people 
for death sonoma county chief deputy district attorney peter 
bumerts said he had a reason why each should die and he then set 
about to kill them and it was only happenstance that saved two of 
them 
salcido also faces attempted murder charges for the throat 
slashing of his daughter who survived and the shooting of a 
coworker at the grand cru winery in glen ellen in californias 
wine country 40 miles north of san francisco 
neatly dressed in a gray suit the defendant appeared to have 
tears in his eyes when the slayings were described 
defense attorney marteen miller who concedes his client 
committed the killings says salcido should be acquitted of 
firstdegree murder because he was incapable of planning the 
crimes 
miller said salcido had been an alcoholic since the age of 18 
and had consumed three grams of cocaine and three bottles of 
champagne in the hours before the slayings which he said were 
committed while salcido was in a psychotic depression 
that state was triggered by a demand for child support from 
salcidos previous wife the prospect of losing his job and fear 
that his wife angela would leave him miller said 
however bumerts said salcidos rage began simmering a year 
after his 1985 marriage when his wife told him sofia the daughter 
she was carrying at the wedding was not his 
though he remained with her and fathered her two subsequent 
children the anger and humiliation stayed with him and 
surfaced later on he said 
bumerts said salcido wanted to kill his inlaws because they 
knew he was not sofias father and he wanted to kill his 
coworkers because he believed they were trying to get him fired 
salcido was arrested near his birthplace in mexico within a week 
of the killings and confessed to authorities his videotaped 
statement will play a major role in the trial bumerts said 
salcido is charged with fatally shooting angela 24 at the 
couples duplex in boyes hot springs and cutting the throats of 
their three daughters and leaving them for dead at a county dump 
sofia 4 and teresa 22 months died carmina then 2 survived to 
tell detectives daddy cut me 
the first witness timothy smith told of finding the girls near 
the quarry where he works he discovered sofia and teresa first 
then went back and spotted carmina 
i went down the embankment after her set her on her feet and 
asked where her mommy was smith said adding that he then 
realized the little girls throat had been cut from ear to ear 
salcido also is accused of fatally stabbing his motherinlaw 
marian richards 47 and her 12yearold daughter ruth in their 
home in cotati and killing richards 8yearold daughter marie by 
cutting her throat 
salcido also is charged with fatally shooting tracey toovey 35 
a coworker at the winery 
other charges include attempted murder for the attack on carmina 
and for allegedly shooting coworker kenneth butti and allegedly 
trying to shoot buttis wife terri the buttis are among the 
prosecutions witnesses carmina reportedly living with a missouri 
family wont appear bumerts says 
the trial was moved from sonoma county to san mateo county near 
san francisco because of extensive publicity

a gasoline tanker that exploded and 
burned for more than a day before being doused monday burst back 
into flames hours after firefighters declared victory 
shes engulfed there its the same thing as we had 
yesterday coast guard petty officer patrick higgins said late 
monday he described the mv jupiter as engulfed in flames about 
nine hours after authorities thought they had doused the fire 
believed to have killed one crewman 
firefighters werent able to explain why the blaze reignited 
aboard the vessel moored in the saginaw river 
they planned to wait for morning to renew the battle because it 
would be too dangerous at night higgins said 
officials had pronounced fire extinguished about 130 pm 
monday the explosions and fire that broke out sunday morning 
killed one of the ships 18 crew members and left three 
hospitalized in fair condition 
earlier firefighters from boots amp coots a houston firm 
specializing in petroleum blazes knocked down the flames by 
dousing them with water and fireretardant foam from the decks of a 
coast guard ship 
cleanup crews put spongelike material in the water to prevent 
gasoline from seeping into the river said clay evans spokesman 
for the spill control association of america an industry 
spillresponse group 
evans said a small amount of gasoline leaked into the river 
which was closed to boaters monday 
dave usher president of marine pollution control in detroit 
said monday that a few thousand feet of absorbent padding and booms 
about 10 inches thick were at the site 
its under control but theres always a danger usher said 
of a potential gasoline spill 
the michigan department of natural resources conducted water and 
air contamination tests thick smoke blanketed the area until the 
fire was doused 
hundreds of dead shad walleye and perch washed ashore as far 
away as a halfmile from the tanker said terry walkington a 
department spokesman 
there was some fish lost we dont know if it was the 
explosion or if it was from the heat that caused stress on the 
fish said mike moore department deputy director 
preliminary water tests showed no heavy concentrations of 
gasoline or oil said david hales director of the natural 
resources department we wont be able to get a detailed analysis 
until later this week he said 
spilled gasoline was unlikely to have longterm effects on fish 
because it evaporates rapidly walkington said 
the tanker owned by cleveland tankers inc a subsidiary of 
ashland oil inc was ripped by an explosion sunday morning as it 
unloaded its cargo of unleaded gasoline at bay citys total 
refinery dock facility the first blast was followed by explosions 
in each of the ships remaining five cargo holds 
the jupiter had unloaded about 30000 barrels of its 
54000barrel cargo when the blast occurred said dan lacy 
spokesman for ashland which is based in ashland ky 
investigators were unsure what caused the fire one possibility 
was that the wake of a passing ship could have parted some of the 
jupiters mooring lines and its gasoline connection spilling fuel 
that ignited and caused the blast lacy said 
ashland spokesman tom dalesio said a small quantity of gasoline 
leaked into the river shortly after the explosion but had 
evaporated or been burned off by the intense flames 
damage to the jupiter wont be assessed until the tanker cools 
enough for investigators to board and inspect possibly as early as 
tuesday said tom dalesio another ashland spokesman 
the missing crewman tom sexton 46 of iowa was believed to 
have died while swim toward shore state police spokesman robert 
nelson said

bramble said maria lopez said ofarrill stole two gold chains and 
reached into her blouse to see if she was hiding money in her 
brassiere 
the young man was trying to avenge his mothers mugging

of them she said adding that she then called home and told her 
sons victor and raymond 21 what had happened 
i feel guilty she sobbed if i hadnt called my son this 
wouldnt have happened 
ofarrill was notorious in the neighborhood for strongarm 
robberies she alleged 
mostly everybody had been mugged by him even people in his 
own building mrs lopez said adding that he belonged to a gang 
known as los machoteros or the machetewielders 
the detectives told me that even his mother said she expected 
this to happen she said 
mrs lopez talked her son into surrendering after two area 
teenagers were arrested and charged with the killing i believed 
it wasnt right she said i told him theres no need to be 
hiding 
lopez was arraigned in bronx criminal court on one manslaughter 
count and one count of criminal possession of a weapon his 
remained in jail with bond set at 5000 
the sons found ofarrills alleged accomplice who told them he 
only tagged along when ofarrill mugged their mother for money to 
buy crack police said 
the sons spent an hour looking for ofarrill before they found 
him at drugplagued st marys park 
as they approached ofarrill swore at them and tried to pull 
something from his waist and thats when my son stabbed him in the 
arm mrs lopez said 
ofarrill died of loss of blood from stab wounds to the chest 
arm and leg said ellen borakove a spokeswoman for the medical 
examiner 
i never knew a killing would happen all we wanted to do was 
to take them to the police mrs lopez said

us and philippine officials opened 
talks tuesday on the future of us military bases and the chief 
american negotiator said the days of a large us military presence 
here are coming to an end 
what remains for us to determine is the rate at which this 
presence will be reduced and the nature of the relationship our two 
governments wish to pursue chief us negotiator richard 
armitage told the opening session 
us and philippine panels resumed the talks that began last may 
on the future of clark air base the subic bay naval base and four 
smaller installations 
the lease on the bases expires in sept 1991 and president 
corazon aquino says it is time to discuss the orderly 
withdrawal of the 40000 american troops defense department 
civilians and military dependents stationed here 
it is clear to me that the days of a very large presence of 
us sailors and airmen in the philippines are coming to an end 
armitage said in his opening remarks 
on monday police clashed with hundreds of demonstrators who 
demanded that the americans go home at least 17 people were 
arrested and seven people were injured in two antibases rallies 
outside the us embassy 
state department spokesman richard boucher said monday in 
washington the bush administration hoped any new acccord would 
include provisions for a continuing defense relationship 
including us access to philippine military facilities 
 
the two sides agreed during the opening round in may to continue 
talks on a new usphilippine security agreement 
opposition to the bases is growing among filipinos who consider 
them an infringement on national sovereignty 
on the eve of the talks mrs aquino said in a nationally 
televised address that the negotiations will redefine relations 
between the united states and this former american colony 
it is now necessary for our government to work with the united 
states for arrangements regarding the orderly withdrawal of their 
forces from our country she said 
last friday the washington post reported that us negotiators 
will offer to close the bases over 10 years 
manila newspapers reported last month that the philippines will 
propose that clark air base and other facilities be closed next 
year in return for allowing the americans to keep subic for 10 
years 
us officials said the 40000 american troops defense 
department civilians and military dependents will remain as long as 
they are wanted 
the installations are among the largest american bases on 
foreign soil 
in a world where the cold war has ended and events in eastern 
europe and the middle east have altered the traditional 
geopolitical order the decadesold parameters of the 
philippineus relationship no longer hold mrs aquino said 
the old cannot continue the new must now be born she 
added this new relationship shall be the subject of the talks 
that begin tomorrow 
rafael alunan the spokesman of the philippine panel said 
manila wanted the talks to restructure our relations to cover a 
broad range of concerns 
for us there is more to life than security matters and that 
is what we have to impress upon them alunan said 
mrs aquino also noted that a government panel is working on 
plans to convert the bases into civlian use the panel is expected 
to finish its report next month 
any new agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate where opposition to the facilities is 
strong 
us troops have been restricted to their bases to prevent 
attacks by communist rebels in may two american airmen were 
killed outside clark on the eve of the first round of talks 
early monday about 350 protesters marched to the us embassy 
but were driven away by police after some in the crowd hurled small 
bombs a judge and two policemen were injured and three 
demonstrators were arrested 
later about 1000 protesters returned but police again blocked 
their march about 200 yards from the embassy at least 14 more were 
arrested and at least three demonstrators and a policeman were 
hospitalized for blast wounds 
col ricardo reyes manila police operations chief said the 
demonstrators provoked the second clash when they tried to break 
the police line

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
sept 1017 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the board of directors of the associated press 
has approved a general assessment increase of 39 percent for its 
1538 daily and weekly newspaper members and 5800 broadcast 
members effective jan 20 1991 
william j keating chairman of the ap board of directors and 
chairman and publisher of the cincinnati enquirer said the 
assessment increase in percentage terms was the lowest in three 
years 
mindful of the difficult times that confront much of the 
industry at this stage the board approved a rate increase that is 
well below the projected inflation rate for 1990 and 1991 
keating said 
the 39 percent increase will not cover all of the increases and 
new costs faced by ap ap will continue to meet the growing demands 
of the news industry through a vigorous cost control effort and by 
increasing nontraditional revenue sources keating said 
nontraditional sources now make up 24 percent of aps revenue 
eleven years ago that figure was 7 percent 
of the new money that ap needs to fund 1991 operations and 
continue to improve services only 31 cents of every dollar will 
come from the assessment increase keating said 
it is vital to all of us that our cooperative remain strong 
and able to meet the challenges in news coverage and technology 
keating said even as some members reduce their own activity to 
absorb the impact of a difficult year in the industry demands on 
the ap grow as we look to ap to do things that in a healthier 
time we might not have relied on ap to do 
the general assessment increase will be combined with another 
step in the phasein of the circulationbased newspaper formula for 
those members that have not reached their appropriate assessment 
level the 1991 assessment also will reflect any circulation 
changes at the member newspaper 
the assessment increase applies to all basic services for both 
newspapers and broadcasters and to all supplemental services except 
for the rates for financial market tables which are being adjusted 
downward in two steps in 1990 and 1991 to reflect savings achieved 
in producing computergenerated stock lists 
ap members will receive their new weekly assessment figures by 
early october keating said

us employees of the reuters news agency 
authorized their union leadership to call a strike against the 
company the newspaper guild of new york said 
guild members voted by a larger than 201 margin for the 
authorization after contract talks that began nearly a year ago 
failed to result in an agreement the guild represents nearly 500 
employees including 150 journalists 
in a sept 10 news release the guild blamed the failing talks 
on reuters demands that it substantially raise the cost to 
employees for their health insurance while cutting maternity 
benefits and severance pay 
andrew nibley reuters editor responsible for north america and 
latin america refused to discuss details of the negotiations while 
they are in progress 
i would say that all major us corporations are dealing with 
the whole issue of spiraling health care costs and how they can be 
contained we think that our salaries are quite competitive and 
among the best in the industry he said 
i dont think a strike would be in anyones interest and i

united press international is closing bureaus 
in five states as part of a general staff realignment 
spokesman milt capps confirmed a report in the albuquerque 
nm tribune that bureaus in new mexico wyoming and montana 
would be closed he declined to say how many layoffs were involved 
capps also said upi had given notice to staffers in oneperson 
bureaus in grand rapids mich and bismarck nd 
he said the news service was expanding its stringer networks in 
the affected states and working on a number of joint ventures 
with people in the regions for additional coverage 
upi is taking quite a few steps this summer and fall to 
realign our staffing in the wake of our creation of a number of new 
autonomous editorial units he said the upshot is that 
virtually every bureau in the system worldwide is affected either 
by increases or decreases 
capps declined to discuss whether any future closures are 
planned or how many bureaus upi now operates in the united states 
last month he confirmed a washington post report that 31 upi 
reporters and editors were being laid off 
capps said there will be net increases in staffing in such areas 
as sports business and finance and emphasis on upis joint 
ventures with cable tvs financial news network states news 
service and financial world magazine 
we are developing what we think is a new role for upi after 83 
years which entails not only strong general news service but 
increased emphasis on focused news reports that can command a 
premium in the marketplace including media and corporate 
subscribers he said 
the bottom line is we can now say we have more people writing 
for upi across the board than a year ago he said

an appeals court lifted a ban on publication of 
a book about israels secret service reversing a judges order to 
halt distribution at the request of israel 
israels claim that the book endangers its intelligence agents 
has not been sufficiently supported the appellate division of 
new york supreme court ruled unanimously sept 13 
the day before judge michael dontzin had issued a temporary 
restraining order barring st martins press from distributing the 
book titled by way of deception the making and unmaking of a 
mossad officer 
the israeli government filed a lawsuit claiming the book could 
imperil agents of the spy agency known as mossad by blowing their 
cover 
the book was written by victor ostrovsky who says he was a 
mossad agent for four years in the 1980s he said in the book that 
israel had detailed information about preparations for the bombing 
that killed 241 marines in lebanon in 1983 but gave the united 
states only a vague warning so that usarab relations would be 
damaged 
the publisher said it would start sending the book to bookstores 
again 
we think its a victory for a free press and we are going to 
sell the book again said roy gainsburg president of st 
martins orders have increased dramatically which is what 
always happens when you try to stop a book

the 6 percent state tax plus any local option taxes will be 
collected on sales and subscriptions and will raise 257 million a 
year tom herndon director of the department of revenue said

newspapers the court then went a step further and voided the 
exemption entirely 
a services tax that was enacted in 1987 included both magazines 
and newspapers but when the services tax was repealed the sales 
tax was extended only to magazines

the us military is handing out 
radios and more newspapers to gis hungry for news but its not 
printing or broadcasting anything the strictly moslem government 
could deem religious or racy 
in the early weeks of the deployment troops often asked 
visitors to send copies of local newspapers saying they knew 
little about their mission or the situation back home 
operation desert shield since has spawned two newspapers the 
desert defender and the desert dragon as well as several more 
informal newsletters 
the military distributed portable radios by the dozens at base 
camps last week so the troops can hear armed forces radio and 
local englishlanguage broadcasts 
the radios were distributed after the military made sure that 
none of the broadcasts include religious programming or gospel 
music 
we are being very sensitive to the culture of the host 
country army col rick kiernan said we want to get the troops 
music information and sports programming but we also want to be 
good guests 
a transmitter was recently installed in saudi arabia to relay 
the radio and armed force television also is available in some

the plain dealer lost a 136 million libel 
suit to former promoters of the budweiser cleveland grand prix who 
said they were defamed by stories in the newspaper in 198486 
the plaintiffs had asked for 16 million in damages publisher 
alex machaskee said the newspaper will appeal the sept 14 verdict 
ck newcomb and associates along with charles k newcomb and 
james h foster promoted the event starting with the first race 
in 1982 
a week before the 1984 race the newspaper published a story 
saying newcomb and foster paid themselves nearly 1 million from 
race proceeds in violation of a lease they had with the city 
the articles also said the race did not satisfy rent payments to 
the city because newcomb and foster told the city the race was 
deeply in debt 
lawyers for the plain dealer argued during the eightweek trial 
that the primary points of the articles were true 
the plaintiffs argued that the race in fact lost money its first 
two years and that the articles were false 
newcomb and foster sold the rights to the race in march 1985 to 
businessman and former race car driver roger penske and the plain 
dealer later became cosponsor of the event

a federal judge dismissed a trademark 
infringement action brought by new kids on the block a pop group 
that sued usa today and star magazine for using their name in 
telephone surveys 
us district judge william j rea ruled sept 10 that the use 
of 900 toll numbers to gauge popularity of the group was a news 
gathering activity and therefore protected by the first amendment 
usa today asked readers who their favorite new kid was and star 
asked readers who they thought was the sexiest new kid each phone 
vote had a fee 
the new kids lawyer philip heller said he would appeal 
while we recognize the importance of the first amendment we 
disagree with judge reas application of it in this case heller 
said 
heller said 900 numbers are commercial services and the first 
amendment does not protect the use of anothers trademark and 
likeness to further commercial ventures even if a newspaper is 
involved he said 
he said the 900 polls competed with the groups own 900 hotline 
by using pictures of the singing group and their name

a judge decided to allow reporters to take 
notes in his courtroom prompting philadelphias two daily 
newspapers to drop a legal challenge 
common pleas court judge eugene ej maier signed an order sept 
11 lifting the prohibition he earlier had said he felt notetaking 
could distract a jury and undercut the official record of a court 
proceeding 
after i had given further thought to it i dont think it 
offends me and we shouldnt keep on with it as long as we could 
control the matter in another way maier said 
he said he might ask reporters to sit in a part of the courtroom 
where jurors cannot see them 
philadelphia newspapers inc publisher of the philadelphia 
inquirer and the philadelphia daily news dropped its appeal of the 
ban which had been pending in state superior court 
the case arose when daily news reporter joseph p blake was 
ordered by a court officer last month to stop taking notes during a 
murder trial two inquirer reporters on separate days also were 
prevented from taking notes 
there has been a gut feeling that note taking should not be 
permitted the judge told an attorney for the newspapers 
according to a transcript of an aug 20 meeting in his chambers 
it may set up a method by which the official transcript can be 
tested or can be impeached should we say or at least 
contradicted maier said 
a jury could be swayed to give greater attention to some 
testimony rather than other testimony because a person took 
notes he said 
the newspapers said in their appeal the rule violated federal 
and state constitutional rights of reporters to cover criminal 
trials as surrogates for the public 
after lifting his ban the judge said he would continue to 
prohibit notetaking by members of the public who are not media 
representatives and would reserve the right to ban notetaking by 
reporters 
a judge is like the captain of a ship he said the judge 
has to control the courtroom the worst thing that can happen is 
that you dont have that control

attorneys for the columbus dispatch asked 
the us supreme court to rule on a gag order issued in a juvenile 
court custody case and upheld by the ohio supreme court 
without guidance from this court state courts have developed 
conflicting approaches to the constitutions role in ensuring 
public access to juvenile court said the writ filed sept 11 on 
behalf of dispatch printing co which publishes the dispatch 
the writ said judges should have to consider first amendment 
issues along with other evidence when they issue a gag order or 
close a custody case to the public 
judge ronald solove of franklin county juvenile court issued gag 
and closure orders last year in a threeway custody fight by two 
wouldbe adoptive parents and the surrogate mother of tessa reams 
now 5 
an appeals court reversed soloves order but the ohio supreme 
court then upheld the order the high court said juvenile 
proceedings are not presumed to be open and can be closed whenever 
a judge determines the psychological harm the publicity might cause 
the child outweighs the publics interest in the case the court 
said first amendment rights did not have to be considered 
solove has since reversed his decision but the ohio supreme 
court ruling still stands 
the dispatchs lawyers argued in court papers that the state 
supreme courts ruling missed the mark by relying on 
outofcontext snippets from unrelated decisions 
they also said the state court misconceived the nature of

the indianapolis convention and visitors 
association must open its financial records because it receives 
substantial public financing the indiana court of appeals said 
the sept 11 decision upheld a county court ruling in favor of 
the indianapolis news and its parent company indianapolis 
newspapers inc 
the convention bureau had argued it wasnt a public agency 
subject to the states public records act it said forcing it to 
open its records will have farreaching negative consequences 
for similarly situated groups that do business with government 
but the appeals panel concluded the public has a right to know 
how its money is being spent by such organizations 
icva receives approximately 70 percent of its revenue from 
public funds therefore the legislature has entitled the public to 
review the expenditure of those funds appeals judge linda chezem 
wrote 
clearly the legislature intended the public to have the right 
to investigate whether its tax money was properly spent 
according to court records the association is a group of about 
600 members interested in promoting and advertising indianapolis as

dissident southern baptists have formed 
an alternative to the groups news agency that will be run in part 
by a gannett executive a communications professor and the news 
editor of people magazine 
leaders of the new associated baptist press began organizing the 
news agency sept 11 
the move is in response to the firing this summer of the two top 
editors of the baptist press the denominations longtime news 
agency 
the firings came during a closed meeting of the southern baptist 
conventions executive committee and further fueled a debate over 
freedom of speech and access to information within the nations 
largest protestant denomination 
conservative baptists accused the fired editors al shackleford 
and dan martin of being biased toward the moderates in their 
reporting 
moderate baptists on the other hand believe baptist press now 
will become a closely controlled public relations agency for the 
conservativedominated southern baptist convention 
i think the free flow of information goes to the bedrock 
belief of the baptist faith said charles overby president of 
the gannett publishing foundation in washington 
overby a southern baptist layman who is a member of the 
15member board of the new agency said baptists have a tradition 
of free speech 
that is how baptists came to be so the abp is rooted in the 
history of baptists and i believe that the work of this 
organization will be consistent with the needs of baptist people to 
stay informed he said 
shackleford is also a member of the board of the new abp 
other board members include carl l kell professor of 
communication and broadcasting at western kentucky university hal 
wingo news editor of people magazine raymond mcdaniel retired 
editor of the shreveport la times and catherine allen of 
samford university in alabama 
bob terry editor of the missouri state baptist newspaper 
presided over the meeting and warned that the new organization 
should not be identified as a moderate baptist news agency 
rather he hopes it will be regarded as an uncensored source of 
information for southern baptists 
matters of financing and personnel are yet to be worked out but 
leaders hope the new press can start functioning this fall

wilkerson said the paper had been hit with four to five 
lawsuits within the last year two of those were filed by former 
district judge paul keohane and former canon city administrator 
errol snider 
they were all public officials said wilkerson anytime 
you challenge government they put these slap suits on you 
were just a controversial newspaper and they cant stand that 
keohane who says he was voted out of office because of a 
cartoon and articles printed in the observer said the closure of 
the paper would not affect his lawsuit set for trial in july 1991 
i suspected this would happen said keohane who now 
practices law in canon city id say this is probably good for 
the community im glad to hear it

mayor david dinkins aides are attempting to 
show that a time magazine story and poll that portrayed the city as 
a declining metropolis were misleading 
press secretary albert scardino said time had made a gross 
misrepresentation of its own data to let new yorkers paint a 
negative view of themselves 
the fact is the overwhelming majority are proud of their 
city he said they came here for great opportunities and still 
have them despite the problems 
the magazine reported that 73 percent of 1009 city residents 
interviewed aug 25 said they thought new york was dangerous and 
that 59 percent said they would move somewhere else if they could 
but it did not report that 70 percent thought the city was 
exciting or that 78 percent of the respondents described their 
neighbors as friendly 
jennifer hillings epstein a time spokeswoman said the article 
was neither misrepresentative nor unfair 
we used the news from the poll she said were a news 
magazine and we used the news

thermalkem attorney richard willis said company officials asked 
for the order to protect trade secrets and employee confidentiality 
and to prevent a repeat of statements made by citizens after a tour 
of thermalkems facility in 1989 after that tour members of the 
group said they became ill at the plant 
the environmental groups and the herald newspaper of rock hill 
are opposing the order 
robert guild a lawyer for citizens for clean air and water of 
rock hill and environmentalists inc of columbia said the order 
would shield broad classes of information from being released from 
the facility and would reduce public access

department of health and environmental control 
ron stanley appointed to hear an administrative appeal of 
thermalkems permit is considering the order which would prohibit

to schedule a special hearing

the state supreme court on sept 12 let 
stand a lower court order that the albuquerque journal turn over 
photographic negatives of a fatal highway accident for use in a 
lawsuit 
a panel of three justices rejected without comment the 
newspapers request to nullify the order 
the negatives are sought by ford motor co and john barton 
whose 62yearold wife was killed in 1985 when her car collided 
with a truck near santa fe 
barton sued the automaker alleging a defect in the car caused 
the headon crash 
ford issued a subpoena for the photographs and negatives in 
july the company said they are essential in determining the 
liability issues in the case 
state district judge art encinias ruled sept 4 that the 
journals constitutional privilege to protect its news gathering 
did not outweigh the need for the pictures he ordered the 
negatives turned over within 10 days 
the journal argued it had a first amendment privilege to 
withhold the unpublished photographs and protect its right to 
freely gather news 
jim dines a lawyer for the journal told the justices in a 
hearing sept 12 that the issue was a very important 
constitutional matter that involves the freedom of the press 
dines said he had reviewed 10 court cases from various states on 
similar issues and that in seven of them photographs were found to 
be qualifiedly privileged and were not required to be turned 
over 
he also argued that the 46 negatives were not necessary to 
determine the precise location of the scene of the nov 12 1985 
accident because that information was available elsewhere 
charles peifer an attorney for ford which teamed with barton 
to obtain the photos said the litigants wanted to determine the 
position of the vehicles relative to one another and whether debris 
at the site had come off the vehicles before the accident or as a 
result of impact 
that information cannot be obtained from the picture the journal 
published which the newspaper provided to the litigants or from 
any other sources peifer said

police eliminated the doe gang without firing 
a single shot 
for 17 days the pekin daily times blamed nearly every crime in 
this illinois river city on john jane and assorted other does to 
protest the police departments refusal to identify people 
arrested 
police agreed to reveal the names and the newspapers doe watch 
has come to an end 
the doe family was a ficticious creation of the police as a 
way to shield the names of people arrested each day said kent r 
davy the times managing editor 
police chief jack leuck scrapped the secrecy policy sept 4 
allowing the times to print the names of everyone arrested daily 
after city lawyers advised him the department might be violating 
state law 
leuck a retired fbi agent said he took over a year ago and was 
told the policy had been in effect at least 15 years he said the 
police changed suspects names to doe to protect anyone who was not 
formally charged 
sometimes we pick someone up and the victim decides not to 
press charges he said people change their story or make 
things up and we end up releasing the individual who was arrested 
if that arrest is reported it can cause an individual irreparable 
harm 
davy a lawyer and former assistant prosecutor in guam sees it 
differently he said abuses could occur if police arrest records 
are kept secret in the city of 34000 people near peoria in 
central illinois 
people ought not be whisked away and jailed without the public 
knowing davy said in an editorial people of position and 
influence ought not to be able to avoid prosecution after an arrest

iraqi officials censored a cnn report sept 12 
in which a woman who had been trapped in kuwait said iraqis killed 
people simply because they had pictures of the countrys deposed 
emir 
as in previous cases the report was censored by fastforwarding 
past the womans comments during the reports satellite 
transmission from baghdad making her words unintelligible a cable 
news network spokesman said 
however correspondent tom mintier who filed cnns report from 
baghdad called a colleague in jordan with his recollection of the 
womans comments which was relayed to cnn in atlanta for a later 
broadcast cnn said 
the woman whose name was not released was on a londonbound 
charter flight filled with foreigners who had been trapped in 
kuwait since iraqs aug 2 invasion of that country cnn spokesman 
steve haworth said 
in an interview during the flights stopover in baghdad she 
said that they iraqis are killing them for having pictures of 
the emir and paper flags the kids have for school they are killing 
them for this its getting really bad 
the woman apparently referred to kuwaitis and paper kuwaiti 
flags 
iraqi censorship of us network reports occurring even as 
iraqi president saddam hussein continues to try to portray himself 
positively on television is neither unusual nor yet excessive 
network officials say 
its a common experience among all the networks said ed 
turner cnns executive vice president for news gathering 
turner said another networks shot of baking pita bread was 
censored and yet another had a sound bite from saddam himself 
and that was fastforwarded 
cnn has been censored about six times which is not so many as 
to be onerous but it is annoying turner said 
each time including sept 12 cnn showed the full report as it 
was received from baghdad but noted which parts were censored 
david miller foreign editor for nbc news said three taped nbc 
reports all about hostages had been censored during satellite 
transmission the correspondents words were not altered but the 
picture was blurred he said 
each time the nbc nightly news aired the full report 
iraqi censors seem most sensitive to reports on hostages said 
cbs foreign editor al ortiz but the censorship has not been so 
severe that we havent been able to still manage to get the 
story reported he said 
miller said there were no advance warnings from iraqi officials 
and they seemed to have no rules 
i dont think they have guidelines theres no set of 
rules the way the us military in saudi arabia does it

began in the house in 1979 and in the senate in 1986 have been 
beneficial to the public 
cspan the cable network that telecasts public affairs 
programs also welcomed the experiment 
fortyfive states have approved the use of television cameras in 
their courts and supporters say there have been no adverse 
results 
the action does not mean federal criminal trials will be 
televised the judicial conference left intact a rule banning 
cameras in criminal cases 
nor will supreme court proceedings be televised anytime soon 
the judicial conference has no control over the high court and 
most justices are believed to oppose cameras there

business news in the right area as vice president and general 
manager of wrbn king has overseen operations at the richmond 
station since it began broadcasting june 14 
the diversified marketplace that we have here has confirmed to 
us since weve been on the air that there is a significant appetite 
for what were doing he said we expected that people would 
find our format interesting at times during the day but were 
finding that people are tuning in longer

share the two other stations in the format have lost listeners 
wbniam radio which billed itself as roanokes only business 
news station suspended operations last month after less than five

a radio talk show host who was supposed to 
help moderate a gubernatorial debate sept 12 was removed from the 
program after one of the candidates questioned his objectivity 
republican candidate dave frohnmayers campaign demanded that 
the league of women voters sponsor of the debate remove alan 
siporin from the fourmember debate panel 
siporin has made comments on the air during his radio program 
that give us very clear reason to question his objectivity when it 
comes to dave frohnmayer campaign spokesman dave henderson said 
siporin of eugene radio station klcc said he was shocked to 
learn he had been removed he said he had maintained good relations 
with frohnmayer the state attorney general over the years 
if a person who is running for governor is willing to go to 
these lengths to keep someone off a panel of journalists you have 
to wonder what kind of access the people of oregon through the 
media will have to the governor siporin said 
frohnmayers debate with democrat barbara roberts independent 
al mobley and libertarian fred oerther was sponsored by the league

federal prosecutors said the process of 
elimination points to a christian broadcasting network technician 
as the person who interrupted two adult entertainment channels with 
religious messages 
defense attorneys for thomas m haynie however told a jury 
sept 11 that in its process of elimination the government 
eliminated the real culprit 
james r wilson a justice department attorney said in opening 
arguments 
no one will take the witness stand for the government and say 
that they saw or heard the defendant say or do anything for which 
he could be charged but we will show how it was done from where 
it was done and by doing those two we will show who did it 
stephen e story haynies attorney told jurors the government 
will fail to prove its case because its engineering data on which 
it is basing its case is flawed 
the government doesnt have the right facility this episode 
did not happen at cbn story said 
the playboy channel and home dish only incs exxxtasy channel 
were interrupted on sept 6 1987 with a message flashed on 
screens thus sayeth the lord thy god remember the sabbath and 
keep it holy repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 
wilson said the government will show cbns satellite earth 
station was the only such station operating at the time that could 
have produced the religious message in the form it was sent and had 
the power to pirate the two satellite channels 
the only person working at the earth station that sunday night 
was haynie wilson said 
haynie was indicted in april by a federal grand jury on three 
counts of interfering with the operations of a satellite and three 
counts of violating fcc licensing regulations 
story said the defense would challenge the governments 
technical evidence and show that errors were made in calculations 
and measurements vital to the prosecutions conclusion that haynie 
was guilty 
story said federal communications commission investigators 
ignored numerous other earth stations in their search for the 
pirate story said the defense would offer several alternate 
sources of the message 
the trial was expected to last two weeks

continued to ignore un resolutions 
the us ambassador thomas r pickering said another 
resolution would be drafted to impose an air embargo a step the

after ordering us forces into saudi arabia 
president bush assured congress that he did not believe hostilities 
were imminent although he is warning saddam hussein not to count 
on it 
that mixed message keeps us military options open without 
triggering a law under which bush would have to get congressional 
approval to keep forces in the persian gulf for more than 90 days 
theres no doubt that congress would agree but the 
administration doesnt want to get tangled in the war powers 
resolution a vietnamera legacy opposed by every president since 
it was enacted over a veto and congressional democrats dont seem 
anxious to force a vote that would tie them inextricably to bush 
policy although they have so far applauded it 
thats typical of a system that was supposed to make congress a 
partner in decisions of war and peace but doesnt work 
when he was in congress secretary of defense dick cheney said 
the war powers measure should be repealed 
congress typically tries to avoid responsibility for a 
clear decision avoids confrontation when presidents refuse to 
invoke the acts terms and prefers instead to praise successful 
presidential actions or criticize unsuccessful ones after the 
fact cheney said in a 1989 assessment published by the american 
enterprise institute 
under the war powers resolution approved in 1973 a president is 
required to notify congress within 48 hours when he sends 
combatready forces abroad when they are sent into situations 
where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated 
they cant be kept there longer than 90 days unless the house and 
senate vote approval 
i do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent 
bush told the recessed congress on aug 9 a day after us forces 
began deploying in saudi arabia to the contrary it is my belief 
that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful resolution of the 
crisis 
bush also said that americans were ready to defend themselves 
and that he could not predict how long they would be there 
he has not altered the message nor has he foreclosed further 
military action pointedly reserving that option at his helsinki 
summit meeting with mikhail s gorbachev 
we will continue to review all options with our allies but 
let it be clear we will not let this aggression stand bush told 
congress at its joint session a week ago 
bush clearly has overwhelming congressional support for his 
policy and broader national backing evidenced by the public 
opinion polls he said he wants to cooperate with congress while 
citing his own constitutional powers as the basis for the persian 
gulf operation 
thats always been the war powers impasse presidents claim the 
inherent power to act in time of crisis to defend national 
interests they question the constitutionality of the resolution 
and argue that congress can control warmaking with its power to 
approve or deny appropriations 
the question came up friday at confirmation hearings on supreme 
court nominee david h souter he avoided taking a position on 
constitutionality 
while presidents have avoided imminent hostility reports that 
would have triggered the war powers system congress did vote to 
approve an extended deployment of us troops in lebanon in 1983 
but they were withdrawn anyhow after the suicide attack that killed 
241 americans at a marine barracks 
in operations that have been swift and brief as in the attack 
on libya and the invasions of grenada and panama the 90day 
withdrawal rule wasnt a factor 
in 1987 senate critics of ronald reagans persian gulf tanker 
escort operation tried seven times to force the white house to 
comply with the war powers procedure failing that they tried in 
court and lost there too 
the war powers resolution began as an attempt to restrict nixon 
administration operations in southeast asia it evolved into a 
measure to give congress a role in governing the use of forces in 
crises and conflicts short of declared war 
since it hasnt worked an overhaul was in the works before the 
current crisis 
i favor a very significant revision to eliminate the 
automatic withdrawal provisions and to rely more heavily on 
congress power of the purse to reflect the congressional will 
sen sam nunn dga told cheney at an armed services committee 
hearing on the persian gulf operation 
at the same hearing sen william s cohen rmaine said bush 
would do well to ask congress for a vote in support of his policy 
even though he seems to have all the backing he needs now 
once theres blood on the sand popular opinion might shift 
may very well shift and congress would then be in hot pursuit of 
public opinion thats flowing in the opposite direction cohen 
said 
in his 1989 commentary cheney wrote 
if the united states must use force for any extended period 
it would clearly be better for the country if the president were to 
show the world that he had support for what he was doing

pity the poor reporters for supermarket 
tabloids no one takes them seriously all that trash digging gate 
crashing and photo snapping is hard work 
its not easy being despised by the people you cover ridiculed 
by the literati and detested by your colleagues in the real 
press 
donna balancia knows this well shes been doing it for four 
years off and on as a freelance reporter for the star 
shes crashed roseanne barrs wedding impersonated a deranged 
french woman pretended to be a hospital patient all for that 
exclusive photo or exclusive interview with some soughtafter 
controversial celebrity or newsmaker 
now she wants out balancias next quest she wants to write 
television shows instead of chasing their stars 
the way she is going about attaining that goal however gives 
added meaning to art imitating life if television can be 
considered art 
balancia or dana blanchard as she is known to star readers has 
written produced and directed a television pilot about the madcap 
world of tabloid reporters aaron spelling dynasty 
charlies angels love boat is interested 
this is going to be my big break balancia says by phone 
from the stars beverly hills office its pretty wacky 
balancia is referring to her show in which a young female 
tabloid reporter named dana blanchard looks for love and dirt in 
the employ of national spy a starlike publication populated 
by all sorts of frenetic offthewall gossip mongers 
its a little like abcs anything but love gone amok but 
this is not jamie lee curtis and richard lewis sending teasing 
sexual glances across the newsroom of a chicago magazine instead 
blanchard falls for another reporter only to find that gasp sob 
he works for the competition 
how balancia came to make a television pilot in the first place 
represents a new entree for wouldbe smallscreen moguls 
she enrolled in a university of california at los angeles 
extension course named the ultimate hyphenate taught for the 
first time this year 
instructor and emmywinning director lila garrett head of 
comedy for aaron spelling productions selected nine students for 
the 24week class each student wrote produced and directed his or 
her own television pilot spelling will review every finished piece 
of work and has first right of refusal to option the project and 
shop it to tv networks 
balancias pilot and several others caught garretts eye because 
they were fresh and innovative in the world of television little 
emphasis is placed on on either adjective 
my students really wrote new stuff said garrett theyre 
so hip and theyre so well done it would be a shame if these tapes 
didnt get an airing 
and while spellings involvement is no promise that these 
pilots including balancias will reach prime time it is a 
very very good entree to the television business garrett said 
and these students would have a much harder time getting anyone 
to pay attention to them without this 
balancias pilot is waiting to be edited and then reviewed by 
spelling garrett said shes a journalist and its a very 
original idea she wrote a very funny pilot 
much of it but not the love part balancia stresses was culled 
from the star reporters own experiences 
in one scene intrepid dana blanchard is tearing through a 
celebritys garbage can looking for dirt so to speak that 
part is completely made up balancia emphatically says 
balancia was a reporter for upi and gannett news service before 
making the jump to tabloids 
working for the star balancia says is a lot more fun 
about six weeks ago the paper sent her to tahiti where 
cheyenne brando was rumored to be in a mental institution following 
the shooting of her husband cheyennes halfbrother christian is 
awaiting trial for the slaying 
the daughter of enigmatic actor marlon brando was indeed in a 
psychiatric hospital balancia says so the 30yearold star 
journalist walked right onto the hospital grounds pretended to be 
a french mental patient and asked for cheyenne 
she got as far as the laundry room the nurse started ripping 
into french with me and i couldnt speak that quickly says 
balancia who studied the language in high school 
i said i was a friend of cheyennes and they basically said 
get out of here 
still balancia says the trip was not a bust she interviewed 
the family and cheyennes brother teihotu the stars photographer 
got an exclusive shot of cheyennes freshly cropped bleachedblond 
head 
balancia says such adventures are exciting but she really feels 
called to television writing 
besides she says the money is better

it is difficult to view recessions as 
opportunities since everything seems to drop economic growth 
marketplace values jobs profits and perhaps most important hope 
in the future 
but there are people whose hopes rise while everything about 
them is falling they might not cheer the arrival of recession 
attended by its pain but they view it as a chance to participate 
in the future 
these people are true investors they recognize value are 
willing to take an informed risk and retain an innate faith in the 
economys ability to recover when it recovers so does the market 
value of wellchosen investments 
while recessions conceivably can continue for years as in the 
great depression of the 1930s the eight official economic 
recessions since world war ii have lasted an average of 12 months 
in the depths of these recessions stock prices have dived as 
much as 48 percent as in the recession that began in late 1973 
many of the bargains found in these sales subsequently rose to 
multiples of their purchase prices 
two things prevent people from taking advantage of such sales a 
lack of money since few people have the foresight opportunity or 
means to prepare for a recession and the courage to buy even 
among hardy investors 
the point has meaning at the moment since many economists who 
earlier had been fencesitting now are forecasting a recession over 
the next few months and into 1991 a mild one perhaps but enough 
to qualify 
a recession doesnt necessarily mean a sharp downturn in stock 
prices but that has been the experience prior to each of the 
recessions of the past 45 years there have been no exceptions 
prior to each recession stocks fell 
nobody has yet demonstrated that recession is certain but 
bargainhunting investors are getting ready in case 
gerald perritt editor of the newsletter blue chip values 
studied the experience of investors during those earlier recessions 
and found some bargainhunters 
first he found that during the typical bear market stock prices 
wound down over many months and that what at first appeared to be 
the bottom gave way to further price deterioration 
often he found bargainhunters jumped too early and regretted 
it as prices continued to fall a prolonged bear market he found 
is characterized by dead cat bounces or brief increases that 
merely lead to more declines 
as prices continue to decline he says even longterm investors 
begin to waver and dump their stocks in an attempt to salvage what 
remains of their portfolios usually this occurs near the ultimate 
bottom 
since nobody knows when a bounce is a dead cat or when a 
bottom is the ultimate perritt believes smart investors must 
follow rules of restraint 
based on his studies he believes the best time to buy in bear 
markets is three to six months after a recession begins since 
world war ii recessions have ranged from seven to 17 months with 
12 months the average 
in buying at midway in the recession bargainhunters would be 
relying on two factors favorable to prices the federal reserve 
will attemp to pump money into the economy and the extreme 
optimists will think of buying 
buying at midway however isnt easy the economic numbers will 
look bad the pessimists will be in their glory the news reports 
may sound foreboding and economic confidence may be shot 
by perritts reckoning however that is when you must make your 
move just as the stock market falls prior to recession it rises 
prior to recovery not to move decisively might mean losing out on 
the best buys in years

detroit ap with anxious eyes on the middle east americans 
are suddenly aware that there are arabs in their midst just as 
american as they are rich bold colorful tiles in the american 
mosaic 
for years they were an invisible minority selfclothed in 
ethnic and national anonymity 
no one seemed to know or care whither they came when the tokyo 
olympics were televised in 1972 and the athletes of the world 
paraded under their national banners one tv commentator looked 
down on one sparse middle east contingent and concluded it was 
one of those new countries in africa 
today arab americans constitue 1 percent of the us 
population some 25 million in all most are clearly surprised 
even proud to discover so many of their kind have risen to 
prominence in their adopted land 
if they were given an ethnic quiz few would know 
that christa mcauliffe the inspirational schoolteacher who 
died aboard the shuttle challenger was one of their own 
that george mitchell democratic majority leader in the senate 
and john sununu chief of staff in the bush white house and former 
governor of new hampshire have lebanese blood 
arab americans include ucla basketball coach jim harrick 
pioneer heart surgeon michael debakey heisman trophy winner and 
pro quarterback doug flutie oscar winner for amadeus f for 
fahrid murray abraham actor jamie farr of mash fame dean of 
the white house press corps helen thomas founder of mothers 
against drunk driving candy lightner consumer advocate ralph 
nader author and movie producer william peter blatty the 
exorcist indianapolis 500 winner bobby rahal miami heat 
basketball star ron seikaly radio disc jockey casey kasem chess 
champion yasser seirawan singersongwriter paul anka 
they demolish the stereotypical image of the arab as a shadowy 
arms dealer or a swarthy bedouin charlatan waving a scimitar as he 
charges across the desert on an arabian steed or the irresistible 
lover a la rudolph valentino in the old silent movies 
or the obedient shrouded arab women suppressed by male 
masters keening over the dead in eerie wails 
the greatest contradictions to these stereotypes are the arab 
americans themselves can anyone imagine marlo thomas one of the 
nations most ardent feminists in purdah or walking three paces 
to the rear of husband phil donohue and how can anyone compare her 
father actorphilanthropist danny thomas raising money for st 
judes childrens hospital with some cinematic scimitarweilding 
terrorist 
we have the most assimilated ethnic group in the country 
says william baroody jr former chief of the reagan white house 
office of communication a lot of them just werent known as 
quoteunquote arab americans 
weve always been a kind of private people says baroody 
whose grandparents came to the united states around the turn of the 
century i think you are seeing a much greater awareness on the 
part of young people now a greater involvement i think that 
they are a little more proud 
if previous generations tended to lose their identity in the 
melting pot present generations tend to be culturally distinct 
parts of the mosaic 
i think thats true of all ethnic groups baroody says 
but it is definitely true of arab americans 
there is a growing pride in their arabic background in their 
culture their history every arab american knows that the arab 
world larger than the roman empire at its peak preserved the arts 
and sciences as europe fell into intellectual darkness and waited 
for the renaissance the arab american knows that his fellow 
americans use the arabic alphabet and numbers 
the influx of arabs to the united states began about 1880 
recruited as cheap labor for america most very simply sought the 
gold that paved the streets 
the real gold they found was opportunity says alixa naff 
who has specialized in arab american history and works at the 
smithsonian institution she says it is a fiction that they were in 
flight from the turks who controlled much of the arab world until 
world war i although some young men did flee compulsory 
conscription into the turkish army beginning in 1908 
they were natural entrepreneurs many of them did what they knew 
best growing and mareting produce fruits and vegetables 
but they were also merchants and most began peddling notions and 
bibles out of a suitcase from the mountains of west virginia to the 
plains of the midwest they built the mother mosque in cedar 
rapids iowa in 1934 and syrian orthodox churches throughout 
california 
donna shalala chancellor of the university of wisconsin came 
from cleveland where there was a large lebanese maronite catholic 
community her father owned grocery stores and eventually went into 
real estate 
my father was a very unusual man he says he believed in 
womens education my mother was a college graduate my father was 
not he encouraged her to go to law school 
almost every middle easterner of the second and third 
generations speaks of supportive families and a commitment to 
education 
i fulfilled the dreams of my grandparents says shalala who 
was a professor at columbia university president of hunter 
college a governor of the american stock exchange and a director 
of the municipal assistance corp which helped new york city out of 
its fiscal crisis she is also vice chairman of the childrens 
defense fund 
the latest immigrants are fleeing for their lives mostly 
agrarian moslem families from southern lebanon but there are also 
iraqi chaldeans and some palestinians some of them professionals 
many of them seeking greater opportunities the yemenis are fleeing 
poverty to seek jobs in idled auto plants or to work the fields of 
california 
ismael ahmed runs the arab community center for economics and 
social services access in a depressed neighborhood of southern 
suburban dearborn practically under the smokestacks of the ford 
river rouge plant the area he serves is considered the largest 
concentrated arab community outside the middle east 
just within five miles of our center there are 60000 arabic 
speaking people ahmed says six out of 10 of them have been 
here less than five years one out of three doesnt speak english 
two out of three dont read or write english and one out of three 
doesnt read or write arabic

there is an infant mortality rate of 385 per thousand births 
which is as high as a lot of third world countries the 
unemployment rate is from 30 percent to 40 percent always 
yet ahmed says there are up to 5000 new middle eastern 
immigrants ariving in detroit each year many of them seeking out 
family right now the majority can be described as refugees 
without refugee status his center provides a base for 
transition 
and despite the illiteracy many do well they learn to read and 
write english in less time than it takes an american grade school 
pupil to reach the sixthgrade level ahmeds english classes can 
handle 250 people and there is never an empty slot 
in 10 years a new immigrant family will be buying a house in a 
much nicer part of town ahmed says and people will say 
where did they get the money to do that they just got here 
well they didnt go to the movies and they made do they 
systematically aimed at that kind of jump and they helped others in 
their family to do it too 
it is the same sense of family that enabled previous waves of 
immigrants from otherareas to advance in the space of two 
generations 
but while the new arab americans are similar they are different 
too 
at one time detroits arab community was overwhelmingly 
christian ahmed says thats changed i think its much closer 
to equal now with the moslems 
arab americans also have that feeling you are worth 
something he says your religion your culture is worth 
protecting its stronger now among the new immigrants its 
something we work with 
he sees many individual success stories but he is more amazed 
with the general tide of advancement and its regularity some 
firstgeneration families will never be rich but their aim is to 
establish a jumping off place for their children 
that of course is something in common for all immigrants arab 
or otherwise past or present like others they tend at the 
beginning to cluster together where they can share ethnicity in 
kitchen and church today the greatest concentrations besides 
detroit are southern california brooklyn ny the 
clevelandtoledo area illinois massachusetts and texas 
their success says something of the american climate for 
opportunity and change 
donna shalala remembers her father telling her of antiarab 
discrimination in his early days but by the time she was ready to 
emerge from the shelter of her family those barriers were down 
for me when i got to new york i was a little more conscious of it 
because of the size of the jewish community but i found them very 
supportive very helpful and very protective prominent leaders in 
the jewish community were good friends and watched out for me 
because the issue would arise once in a while 
today she is a member of a noname informal group of 10 
composed of jewish leaders and arab americans such as former 
special middle eastern envoy philip habib and former head of pan 
american airways najeeb halaby 
when col james jabara became americas first jet ace during the 
korean war or when joe robbie the son of a poolroom owner bought 
the miami dolphins arab americans were not in the habit of 
exhibiting their ethnic pride 
don bustany a radio producer who works with casey kasem says 
he never thought consciously of assimilation or being absorbed 
in american society i always had my pita bread sandwiches in 
high school and my friends were delighted when they could share 
arabic food at my house he says 
he also remembers the exhilaration at meeting a fellow arab 
american when the common salutation was keefic cousin 
he grew up with the attitude that lebanese were superior people 
i discovered not only was that not true but every ethnic group 
believes that they are he says 
casey kasem who like bustany grew up in detroit where he acted 
in a community playhouse with george c scott is emerging as a 
spokesman for an affirmative arab image he is working with norm 
fleischman who is known as the conscience of hollywood to 
carry that message to the movers and shakers of film and tv 
he suspects the negativism came over from europe when the arab 
world was viewed as a threat to christian nations and the crusaders 
were sent out to battle saladin in the holy land 
arab americans are coming out of the closet he says they 
are more outspoken now than ever before people are beginning to 
realize who they really are that they are not the people who yell 
and scream on their nightly newscast 
and in fact he and bustany are proponents of the cousins program 
of the middle east foundation for peace holding meetings in 
various cities between arab and jewish americans the meetings are 
frequently loud and always confrontational but they are the 
beginning of a dialogue between both sides 
there was a time when poet khalil gibran was about the only arab 
american known to most americans several generations of which 
discovered his the prophet in college or high school but today 
they are all over the american landscape from teen pop singer 
tiffany to singerdancer paula abdul from indianapolis colts 
quarterback jeff george to mezzosoprano rosalind elias who last 
year sang in the new york city operas sweeney todd 
they are peppered through the federal capitol and state capitols 
and the courts north and south there are arab american mayors 
from st paul minn to hartwell ga from azusa calif to 
peoria ill an arab american heads wayne state university 
race car driver bobby rahal is balding wears glasses and is in 
short not your typical race car driver but his father once told 
an interviewer its in the genes the arab people the lebanese 
especially always run scared thats what drives us were more 
afraid of failure than anything its an ego thing we hate the 
flavor of failure and we revel in success 
there is also selwa lucky roosevelt she is like casey kasem 
a druze married to former cia officer archibald bulloch roosevelt 
a grandson of theodore roosevelt her job is chief of protocol for 
the white house 
she once said if i had as a child any experience of sadness 
i suppose it was because i wasnt blond and blueeyed and the girl 
next door but she says she came to love her background 
recognizing it made her an object of interest and gave her more 
empathy

the doors of north americas first 
islamic mosque built here 86 years ago have long been closed but 
islam is flourishing for the muslims who have been practicing their 
faith here since the turn of the century 
twice a week members of the 400strong muslim community come to 
the cedar rapids islamic center to pray socialize and learn just 
as their greatgrandparents and grandparents did when they built a 
whiteframed mosque known as the mother mosque in 1934 
the original mosque was like a family club says taha a 
eltawil the imam or spiritual leader of the center people 
came there with their children and family it was like a community 
gathering place 
the mother mosque was the center of activity for the citys 
muslims until 1972 when the islamic center opened to accommodate a 
growing population the center built for about 500000 has five 
classrooms a small library a large lecture hall offices and the 
traditional prayer hall where the faithful bow on a thick dark 
blue carpet as they face northeast to pray 
it still is a gathering place once a month theres a family 
picnic once a year theres a picnic for the community eltawil 
says 
eltawil says the rich farmland around cedar rapids attracted 
the first muslims to the area by about 1914 there were 45 muslim 
immigrants by the mid1920s after supplying eggs butter and 
other farm products to urban dwellers they had opened more than 50 
shops and stores in the city 
eventually the federation of islamic associations linking 
centers throughout north america was first organized in cedar 
rapids it is now headquartered in detroit 
eltawil says followers of islam have always been accepted by 
iowans even during the iran hostage crisis and this summers 
tensions with iraq 
iowans in general are very good people he says i think 
there is a special attention or treatment for the muslims in iowa 
more than in places like chicago new york or los angeles 
some people did call the mosque during the hostage crisis and 
said it was wrong but not from decent people 
even though the muslims have been worshipping in the community 
for decades eltawil says there is still confusion over who 
muslims are 
muslims are not just arabs he says there are 1 billion 
muslims in the world and only 6 percent are arabs islam has no 
nationality 
in cedar rapids about 60 percent of the muslims are lebanese 
the rest are from pakistan india yugoslavia turkey jordan 
iran egypt and the soviet union 
two years ago eltawil helped organize the islamic council of 
iowa to coordinate the activities and services of the states 7200 
muslims 
the council wants to build bridges between the muslim 
community and other communities we want to unify the work of 
islam says eltawil who is chairman of the sevenmember 
council 
the council also serves as a public relations outlet in case 
something happens in the persian gulf where reaction is asked of 
the muslim community he says

editors note its a sinister land of villany and poverty 
intriguing voodoo rites and exotic art haiti once the richest of 
the french colonies is today one of the worlds poorest countries 
thanks to a succession of corrupt despots there is some hope 
however that elections to be held this year will bring reforms

portauprince haiti ap a few months before his death in 
1971 presidentforlife francois papa doc duvalier named his 
19yearold son jeanclaude as his successor haitians accepted the 
choice by approving a constitutional referendum the vote was 
2391916 to 0 
the country doctor who ruled for 14 years by terror and graft 
thus bestowed his spoils on the beefy indulged teenager baby 
doc who would carry on the family tradition 15 more years 
in the grip of oppression and poverty haitians nourish a 
culture enriched by french african and caribbean influences their 
mysterious voodoo thrives alongside the official roman catholic 
religion 
their love of beauty has produced worldfamous art and finds 
expression not just in paintings but in elegantly designed 
gingerbread houses festively painted taptap buses even the 
pretty ribbons worn by little girls in the slums 
but the legacy of the duvaliers and other haitian despots is a 
land wracked by political upheaval corruption and neglect 
indeed haiti has been misruled by emperors dictators and 
generals virtually ever since the slaves overthrew their french 
colonial masters and founded the worlds first blackled republic 
on jan 1 1804 
once frances richest colony haiti which shares the caribbean 
island of hispaniola with the dominican republic is among the 
worlds poorest countries statistics compiled by the us agency 
for international development reflect the scale of the calamity 
haitis 6 million inhabitants have an estimated per capita 
income of 85 cents a day seven of 10 scratch out a subsistence 
living on meager cropland fewer than half can read and write and 
twothirds of the children never finish primary school four of 
five people have no access to safe drinking water only one of four 
children is immunized against measles and 25000 die each year of 
diarrhea life expectancy is 53 years 
barren erosionscarred hills bear witness to decades of 
uncontrolled felling of trees for charcoal the main cooking fuel 
as recently as 1923 forests covered 60 percent of the land today 
forests cover 2 percent as a result of erosion 14800 acres are 
lost to productive agriculture each year 
farmers unable to feed their families stream to the cities in 
search of 3aday jobs in assembly plants producing everything 
from electronics to baseballs most find no work the rate of 
unemployment and underemployment is estimated at 70 percent 
many drift into the vast seafront shantytown known as cite 
soleil city of the sun the biggest of portauprinces many 
slums 
here an estimated 200000 people live mainly in squalid 
oneroom hovels made of scrap tin and boards with dirt floors and 
no plumbing or lights a field is their communal toilet a hill of 
garbage rots in the tropical heat 
children play a stick game over a filthy open trench while 
others wander in the maze of narrow alleys separating their shacks 
a knot the size of a fist protrudes from one boys navel the 
common sign of an untreated hernia another has a distended belly 
like the victims of the ethiopian famine 
sometimes when you wake up you find something to eat other 
days you dont fannie joseph 46 says in the creole patois 
spoken by most haitains she said two of her five children died of 
tetanus 
most foreign aid to haiti including 70 million a year from the 
united states was withdrawn in protest of an election massacre 
three years ago although haiti offers abundant cheap labor 
foreign companies are reluctant to invest in such a politically 
volatile country 
at one time haiti was a favorite caribbean watering hole of 
celebrities and literati seeking the exotic french and 
creolespeaking land of graham greenes novel the comedians 
about life under papa doc duvalier 
now tourism the economic lifeblood of most of haitis island 
neighbors has been all but wiped out by political turmoil and by 
the spread of aids the notion that aids originated in haiti 
though now rejected by both us and haitian researchers has made 
matters worse

its agonizing says maurice lafortune the commerce 
minister any political instability causes a drop in tourism and 
then there are all the consequences of the accusation that aids 
comes from us 
in desperation haitians sell what little they own for a 
perilous sea passage to the united states in leaky overcrowded 
boats often as not those who make it end up in miamis krome 
detention center to await deportation 
many of haitis current problems can be traced to the repressive 
and corrupt methods of the 29year duvalier dynasty which rose to 
power in the politically unsettled aftermath of the us occupation 
of 19151934 
dr francois duvalier who combined a farright political 
ideology with a rural medical practice became president in the 
fraudulent election of 1957 as the candidate of the black masses at 
a time of economic and political domination by the mulatto elite 
papa doc championed african traditions such as voodoo 
encouraging his subjects to regard him as the embodiment of baron 
samedi a nefarious spirit that oversees cemeteries he enforced 
his will by dividing the army and organizing a private militia of 
informers extortionists and killers known as the tonton macoutes 
numbering in the thousands 
although the militia was officially disbanded after jeanclaude 
duvalier was overthrown by a popular uprising in february 1986 the 
macoutes have never been brought to trial and still wield 
influence 
along with haitis notoriously corrupt 6000member army they 
remain the chief obstacle to democracy in effect haiti has never 
been liberated 
imagine nazi germany after the fall of hitler without a purge 
of nazis from the state apparatus and without the nuremberg 
trials says human rights activist jeanclaude bajeux 
the widespread smuggling drugtrafficking and corrupt business 
practices of todays haiti also echo the duvaliers who amassed 
their fortune by siphoning profits from state industries and 
forcing businessmen to pay huge kickbacks for franchises and import 
licenses 
our legacy is a legacy of corruption as you know says 
commerce minister lafortune who has set up an antismuggling 
brigade to try to slow the flood of untaxed cigarettes radios and 
pocket calculators sold openly on the streets of portauprince 
now more than four years after baby doc fled to france with an 
estimated 600 million in plunder only to be replaced by four 
successive regimes either led or controlled by the army haitians 
are still struggling to install a democratic government 
the caretaker civilian government of president ertha 
pascaltrouillot which was appointed in march after the fall of 
the latest military ruler lt gen prosper avrl is planning 
elections sometime this year 
as if following a script duvalier hardliners have reemerged 
to spoil the vote gunfire again crackles nightly in the slums 
armed robberies and killings go unpunished and people are afraid to 
leave their homes after dark 
it is chillingly reminiscent of the terror campaign in the 
months before haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections on 
nov 29 1987 that election was canceled after gangsters supported 
by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters at polling 
stations 
haitis political leaders agree that the nation stands little 
chance of recovery unless the duvalier legacy is somehow destroyed 
but many haitians doubt that the increasingly unpopular civilian 
government will be able to keep to the election timetable 
its 200 years of repressive government we are trying to 
change says marc bazin a former world bank economist and 
leading presidential candidate this country really is at a 
crossroads 
bazin who has proposed a 600 million emergency aid package 
from the world bank to begin rebuilding haiti says the economy 
could turn around within 10 years under the right circumstances 
were starting from subzero he says people will be 
amazed at the speed we can go once we start 
we are intelligent enough we are industrious enough that if 
we have a government that is working for the people instead of the 
people working for the government we can make haiti the most 
productive nation in the caribbean

portauprince haiti ap relentless poverty in haiti has 
driven an estimated 7000 to 8000 children into the streets of 
this capital city they survive as beggars thieves and 
prostitutes 
the heads of families cant provide for themselves much less 
their children so the children are on the street says jean 
robert chery a social psychologist 
chery runs a training center for 150 boys for the montrealbased 
canadian center for research and international studies the boys 
range in age from 6 to 20 and nearly all are homeless 
chery and his four coworkers feed the boys give them medical 
care and try to prepare them for school and jobs the boys learn to 
read and they play dice and board games to improve their math 
but first chery says they must learn the most basic of skills 
how to wash up in the morning how to sit up straight how to 
talk to somebody 
fifteen of the boys are practicing homosexuals and 
threefourths have had homosexual relations some for money and 
some because of sexual confusion chery says 
its precocious sexuality the psychologist says they 
live in promiscuous conditions they have no mother or father they 
have no one to identify with sexually 
the younger boys suffer from malnutrition their hair turns 
yellow and theyre very very skinny chery says many of the 
older boys are infected with venereal diseases although so far 
there have been no detected cases of aids 
they come here and tell their life stories and i find out 
theyre criminals chery says they should be in probation 
centers but if theyre turned over to the police theyll be 
beaten 
nearly all street children are boys the reseacher says 
little girls are channeled into domestic service or prostitution 
theyre not on the streets 
one of the regulars at the center is 14yearold etan prompted 
by chery the youth lifts his tshirt to expose a jagged scar 
across his belly he says thats where he was shot by robbers who 
broke into his home in the cite soleil slum and killed his father 
unlike most of the other boys etan goes to school chery 
proudly points out that he is first in his class 
i want to work with electronics etan says 
the center is a cramped four rooms in downtown portauprince 
on this particular day chery tries to give a visitor a tour of the 
facilities but a citywide electricity outage makes it difficult 
in one room a halfdozen boys sit around a table in the 
semidark eating oatmeal from tin plates 
we live under miserable conditions but its all we have 
chery says 
the researcher says the center has enough money for rent but 
with hardly anything left over the government provides no funds 
you have to have a state that is assuming its 
responsibilities chery says thats not the case

editors note he was a longdistance runner on the us 
olympic team a record setter in college and later an active 
outdoorsman then 11 years ago max truex was felled by parkinsons 
disease following controversial brain surgery in china hes 
showing marked improvement as the medical community debates the 
ethics of the procedure 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
max truex displays the snapshot of his 
daaged brain like a proud father showing off the first photo of 
his newborn child 
he points to two red spots in the center they indicate that 
controversial brain surgery to give him a fresh shot at life is 
working 
truex once one of americas greatest longdistance runners was 
rendered helpless by severe parkinsons disease 
in his worst moments he had to be spoonfed he couldnt 
swallow and he lost his voice he would propel forward 
uncontrollably and smash into a wall his body would freeze and 
his wife and children would get him moving again 
it was like carrying a corpse says his wife kay 
he had tremors in both arms he couldnt change his blank facial 
expression the former olympic runner needed a wheelchair 
that put an end to his active life as a successful los angeles 
attorney who jogged took backpacking trips skied and hunted in 
africa 
in the 1960 olympics in rome truex ran the fastest 10000meter 
race by any american in track history to that point today he 
limps slowly toward his living room couch sits and points to the 
colorful photo made july 6 at ucla during a brain scan to check his 
condition 
in a rare operation performed in china on april 27 1989 when 
he was 53 brain tissue from three aborted fetuses was put in 
truexs brain the red spots show the tissue has spread and 
produced a vital chemical dopamine that he lacked 
that really confirms for him that hes got a future says 
dr robert iacono the surgeon max was really to the point where 
i dont think he was going to survive he had the worst case ive 
seen 
dopamine helps transmit nerve impulses between brain cells a 
person running out of it is like a car running out of gas says 
iacono assistant professor of neurosurgery at the university of 
arizona 
the surgery took him and truex to a small hospital in china 
where oxygen is delivered by donkey cart and to the fuzzy 
boundaries of medical ethics the us government has banned 
federal funding of research on fetal brain tissue transplants on 
grounds it would encourage abortions 
that issue was secondary to truex whose disease was diagnosed 
in 1979 and who had deteriorated steadily in the five years before 
the surgery 
in china they only allow two children per family the third 
one has to be aborted so it would be aborted anyway he says in 
a soft barely audible voice its a chance i had to take 
now the wheelchair remains folded up beside the couch his gait 
is still awkward he tires easily he has tremors in his right arm 
and he occasionally stutters but he has improved 
i dont lose my balance anymore truex says i dont fall 
i dont freeze up very often and i can smile 
his wife 43 has noticed hes less depressed and jokes more he 
even cooks dinner on the backyard grill for her and their kids 
gene 16 john 13 and mindy 10 
across from his white threestory home on a quiet street in 
this comfortable boston suburb a pleasant grassy area rises 
gently now truex can stroll with kay around its perimeter perhaps 
the distance of a quartermile track without getting exhausted 
he no longer has to awaken her five times a night to help him 
turn over or take him to the bathroom gene and john no longer have 
to hold the urinal for him 
truex whose short gray hair hides the spots where six holes 
were drilled in his skull almost certainly will never return to 
his preparkinsons condition iacono thinks truex suffered some 
mental impairment 
fred olds remembers a different truex as his coach at warsaw 
high school in indiana olds recalls how opponents would laugh at 
the tiny truex who evennow stands just 5feet4inches then the 
race would begin 
he would lap the whole field olds says he was probably 
as perfect an athlete as i ever saw

truex who later was on the track team at the university of 
southern california was a serious and intelligent youngster a bit 
shy and not at all cocky olds says he had an unquenchable thirst 
for running 
a grainy 36yearold blackandwhite film shows the towheaded 
truex setting the national schoolboy mile record of 4 minutes 204 
seconds 
jim beatty the first person to break the fourminute mile 
barrier indoors and truexs teammate in the 1960 olympics ran 
against truex in college 
the picture that would stay with you of maxie is this little 
gutsy runner pounding at you around the track lap after lap after 
lap beatty saysed states but 
found it easier to go to the henan tumor institute in zhengzhou 
china about 400 miles southwest of beijing 
preparatory surgery was done at the university of arizona where 
the holes were drilled in truexs skull to provide passageways for 
the transplanted tissue 
in china a gynecologist got on her bicycle and rode around to 
the other hospitals to talk to friends to see if they would give us 
some tissue iacono says 
the us ban on federal funding for research on fetal tissue 
transplants was imposed in may 1988 the following november a 
national institutes of health advisory committee concluded it is 
morally acceptable to use human fetal tissue from legal abortions 
for research and therapy 
but that recommendation was rejected last november by health and 
human services secretary louis w sullivan he extended the ban 
indefinitely saying such research will increase the incidence of 
abortion across the country 
there is no evidence that thats true says dr murray 
goldstein director of the nihs national institute of neurological 
disorders and stroke in bethesda md he felt from a moral 
viewpoint not scientific that it was improper to lift the ban 
under the projected guidelines for doing the research goldstein 
says the mother would give permission for aborted tissue to be 
used but wouldnt know if it were used also neither the doctor 
doing the tissue transplant nor the recipient of the tissue would 
know where it came from 
from my standpoint i think it is an experiment worth doing 
under experimental conditions he says the reason i wanted it 
done at nih is that it would be done under the spotlight of public 
scrutiny 
privately funded fetal brain tissue transplants have taken place 
in the united states there have been similar transplants in 
mexico england cuba spain and sweden iacono says truexs case 
was unique because he received more brain tissue than other 
patients 
with truex he says weve been able to reverse this always 
progressive disorder i feel real secure that what i did was right 
and it wasnt immoral and unethical

egypts pharaohs built their tombs to last 
an eternity but some of the most magnificent of the royal resting 
places may not make it much past the 20th century 
a main spoiler is man 
drawn by ancient egypts aura of mystery thousands of visitors 
parade every day through the once offlimits world of dead pharaohs 
and their queens they violate tomb chambers designed by ancient 
priests for one mummyfilled coffin 
with that in mind a swiss group has come up with a 
multimilliondollar answer custombuilt tombs clustered in a new 
valley of death especially groomed to accommodate mass 
tourism 
give the tourists what theyve come to see but in facsimile 
if you want to have your tourists and save your tombs 
building replicas is the only answer says theodor abt president 
of the zurichbased society of friends of the royal tombs of egypt 
we havent a minute to lose he says each time i come im 
shocked to see what has happened the world cant afford to give up 
something so unique and precious 
egyptian officials agree in march they approved a proposal from 
the society to duplicate two tombs the tiny goldpainted chamber 
of the boy pharaoh tutankhamen and the larger beautifully 
decorated tomb of nefertari powerful chief queen of warrior 
pharaoh ramses ii 
they are among more than 400 tombs stretching for five miles 
along the nile rivers western bank opposite ancient thebes now 
luxor 450 miles south of cairo 
saving both tombs has been a great worry for antiquities 
officials 
its a wonderful project the answer weve been searching 
for says sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian antiquities 
organization now we can save our tombs without depriving our 
tourists of their beauty 
and if we have to close one or more of them for restoration 
and conservation we wont feel so bad about it 
tawfik says tourists still will be allowed in the original 
tombs but he expects the replicas to deflect masses away from 
endangered ones 
not even egypts mightiest kings foresaw that their secret 
burial chambers carved in valleys so desolate they were unfit for 
the living one day would attract a tourist boom of monumental 
proportions 
but they do each day 3000 to 5000 people crowd the land of 
the dead even in the horrendous heat of upper egypts summer 
humidity dust and salt brought into the tombs by sweaty bodies and 
the touch of countless fingers are eating away at the timeless but 
fragile decorations on their walls 
the only sure way to save them would be politically and 
economically explosive bar tour groups from the most popular 
tombs most visitors travel in groups carried across the nile by 
special launch and bused to the various valleys of death only 
about two dozen tombs are open to the public at any one time 
permanently closing the tombs is an option thats hardly figured 
in years of debate over monument conservation because of a national 
push to bring ever more tourists into egypt 
some 2 million visitors now pump 2 billion a year into egypts 
dollarstarved economy the government predicts the number of 
tourists will double within the next few years 
for antiquities officials whose job is to protect relics 
copying the best and most endangered tombs offers an acceptable 
alternative to locking doors it leaves room for tourist expansion 
also the replicas will be tombs with a difference tourists 
will see them as the ancients did not the faded and damaged 
chambers visited today and with modern touches oneway traffic 
and air conditioning 
abt a zurich psychoanalyst says engineers have selected the 
bonedry faultfilled western valley for the reproductions lying 
just over the hills from the tombs of tutankhamen and fellow 
pharaohs 
the western valley was chosen because of its beauty and 
emptiness the sacred atmosphere so important to early tomb 
builders is something we dont have to duplicate abt says 
its already there 
the west banks most popular tourist spot is the valley of the 
kings where new kingdom rulers were buried for 500 years 
but ancient architects originally gave the royal nod to the 
western valley where they placed the mummy of pharaoh amenophis 
iii in 1353 bc the area later was abandoned in favor of valleys 
to the east and south 
abt says plans call for the first cluster of duplicate tombs to 
include in addition to tutankhamens and nefertaris those of the 
warrior pharaoh tuthmosis iii and two nonroyals sennedjem a 
court official and labor foreman inherkhau 
he estimates each cluster will cost as much as 80 million 
raised in a campaign like the 1960s unesco drive that saved the 
monuments of abu simbel and other nubian sites south of luxor 
abt says duplicate tombs will be lowslung built to disguise 
their locations and decorated by egyptians using techniques of the 
ancients originally tombs were dug into the landscape to hide 
them from wouldbe robbers after the riches accompanying the dead 
pharaoh into the afterlife 
each cluster will be built against the mountains and covered 
with rocks to give the same feeling of antiquity as the ancient 
tombs abt says 
to ensure that each tomb will be correct historically the swiss 
groups 50 international members include as vice president an 
authority on the west bank burial grounds basel professor erik 
hornung 
while new in egypt building replicas to save antiquities is not 
a new concept 
french officials closed the lescaux caves near montignac in 1963 
after 100000 visitors surged in the previous year to see the 
monuments prehistoric paintings in 1983 a facsimile was opened 
which today awes 400000 visitors annually 
spain currently is seeking money to reproduce 12000yearold 
wall paintings of bison and horses at its altamira caves the 
tourist crush in the main cave became so great in 1982 that it too 
had to be closed

editors note for generations the aleuts of alaskas pribilof 
islands sustained themselves by hunting seals then five years ago 
the government banned seal hunting bringing an end to a way of 
life today there is new hope that the sea once again will provide 
a livelihood for the people of the pribilofs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no longer allowed to hunt seals the 
natives of the pribilof islands are looking to the vast fishing 
grounds of the bering sea to revive a floundering economy 
the key to that revival is a new 58 million harbor that was 
dedicated in august 
i wouldnt have come back before because it was so hard to 
find a job said david shane a 23yearold aleut who left st 
paul as a teenager to finish his schooling the opportunities 
now are enormous 
shane returned last year to work in st pauls new crab plant 
in a building formerly used to process seal hides 
when federally managed seal hunting was halted here in 1985 
pribilof island villagers were faced with building a new economic 
base or seeing their community dissolve 
located in the heart of the booming bering sea fishing grounds 
and closer to many of the stocks than bigger dutch harbor st paul 
is betting its future on fishing 
the success of the new harbor depends partly on whether three 
local entities the city the tdx native corporation and the 
tribal council can cooperate on economic development 
but residents are optimistic 
this has been a struggle for freedom and independence says 
tdx chairman ron philemonoff we are free and with the harbor 
here we will soon be independent financially independent 
aleut seal hunters were settled on the pribilofs forcibly by 
russian fur traders in 1820 when the united states bought alaska 
in 1867 the islands quickly were designated the nations first 
wildlife refuge and the government contracted the seal harvest to 
private companies in 1910 it assumed administrative duties 
itself withdrawing in 1983 
the government banned commercial sealing in 1985 because of 
declining seal populations it set up a trust to help islanders 
make the transition to an independent harborbased economy 
alaska commerce commissioner larry merculieff of st paul said 
the islanders sealharvesting history denied them independence and 
unfairly saddled them with the blame for harming the animals 
they labeled our gentle people as brutal bloodthirsty he 
said but we understand that the aleut way is to produce answers 
not tears 
during the harbor dedication over the rumble of an idling motor 
of a visiting ship orthodox bishop gregory of sitka blessed the 
harbor and the villagers sprinkling holy water on the sea the 
dock and the worshipers 
the new harbor is small about 10 acres of moorage and 300 feet 
of docks and cant accommodate ships longer than about 300 feet 
big factory trawlers will anchor outside and take skiffs in for 
supplies 
with its small clinic and airfield st paul already was a 
temporary stop for some ships which traveled on to dutch harbor to 
process their catch 
but dutch harbor the nations busiest fishing port is swamped 
by ship traffic it also is more than 20 sailing hours from st 
paul 
and more ships keep entering the arena 
an estimated 24 billion pounds of bottom fish valued at 200 
million were harvested in the eastern bering sea in 1989 local 
officials said nearly 90 percent of alaskas crab harvest valued 
at more than 182 million also comes from there 
local officials expect between 500 and 1000 fishing vessels to 
call at st paul each year 
many processing and service companies are looking for a toehold 
in what some dub the minidutch harbor 
pribilof islands processors crab plant already is operational 
and eventually could process 150000 pounds daily a 50 million 
surimi plant being built by saint paul seafoods is set to open jan 
1 with a capacity of 400 metric tons daily 
were ready to come in were just waiting for an 
invitation said dick pace president of unisea a seattle 
fishing and processing firm building a 75 million surimi plant in 
dutch harbor 
surimi is a reconstituted fish paste that can take many 
different forms such as fish sticks imitation crab fake lobster 
its a relatively new idea cashing in on some generally 
unattractive fish mostly bottom fish such as pollock 
japan imports a lot of surimi and a great deal particularly 
the imitation crab is sold in the united states 
uniseas wants to build at least one crab plant hiring 190 people 
in st paul pace said but local officials say development has 
been slowed by disagreements between the city tdx which owns most 
of the land and the tribal council 
the citys been talking with virtually every major producer 
said city manager vern mccorkle were expecting them to take up 
additional negotiations with the village corporation 
a variety of dutch harbor service companies are looking at 
expanding to st paul said dutch harbor mayor paul fuhs who has 
helped put together business tours to the smaller community 
both communities fates are closely tied to the changing 
fishery which some fear is in danger of depleting stocks 
when the 1976 magnuson act americanized the fishery by 
creating an exclusive economic zone and extending us jurisdiction 
to 200 miles off the us coast fishermen scrambled to fill the 
void left by foreign trawlers 
an estimated 1900 us vessels operated in the bottom fish and 
crab fisheries off alaska in 1989 more than 700 in the eastern 
bering sea local officials said 
this is an enormous resource the last of the great fishing 
grounds shane says 
and paul shebolin a city worker carrying his 11monthold son 
moisey on his back said change may be slow but it is inevitable 
this is going to be his home he said of the baby were 
building something for the future something the children can fall 
back on

editors note across the land preservationists are trying to 
block the developers bulldozers and among the main arenas in this 
conflict are the plantations and battlefields of virginia its not 
enough just to save the sites preservationists argue but to 
preserve the historic integrity of the surrounding areas as well 
</TEXT>

from george washingtons mount vernon 
to thomas jeffersons monticello from yorktown to appomattox 
preservationists are fighting to save virginias rich vistas and 
historic heritage 
their foes are those who want to build modern homes factories 
and office buildings alongside civil war battlefields and 
18thcentury plantations 
what virginians have done very well is to save the houses 
where jefferson and washington have slept and ate says carter 
hudgins director of the center for historic preservation at mary 
washington college in fredericksburg its easy to save those 
things which are one of a kind 
the more difficult thing is to go the next step and save the 
surrounding land which puts the site in perspective if you lose 
the setting you lose the context you lose the meaning of what the 
world was all about to begin with 
its very very difficult to get people to understand that 
anyone who goes to visit monticello will have an experience thats 
diminished dramatically if they stand on top of thomas jeffersons 
mountain and gaze on the rear end of condominiums 
virginias preservationists dont stand alone 
across the nation many historic sites are threatened by 
development and neglect says peter brink vice president for 
programs and services at the national trust for historic 
preservation in washington 
for example in south pasadena calif a proposed sixmile 
freeway would cut through five national register historic districts 
and destroy 1500 homes 
to an extent we are seeing more potential conflicts between 
preservationists and developers especially on the east coast and 
west coast because of the type of urban sprawl that is 
happening brink says whats needed is a way to plan 
development channel it so it doesnt obliterate the countryside 
preservationists also need to plan ahead so they are working to 
control development before the bulldozers are rolling he says 
that is happening now at antietam national battlefield park in 
maryland much of which is still privately owned 
historic sites are often saved by not in spite of developers 
brink says 
threefourths of the time we consider ourselves partners with 
developers he says 
in january officials at the university of virginia in 
charlottesville dropped plans to swap land at the base of 
monticello mountain so a large office complex could be built on the 
site 
people in stafford county have debated whether the land 
adjoining george washingtons boyhood home should be zoned for 
commercial use 
in culpeper va california developer lee c sammis has 
acquired 5200 acres along the rappahannock river on land where the 
battle of brandy station was fought in 1863 historians have 
described that as one of historys last great calvary battles 
sammis has offered for public use 242 acres that a historic 
consultant deemed significant to the battle says michael armm 
development director for the project called elkwood downs the land 
offered is connected by trails 
armm agreed that there has to be some perspective a buffer 
around the property but some critics complain that if you stand 
on the site and look around you shouldnt be able to see anything 
that wasnt seen from the battle he says 
some kid a hundred years from now is going to get interested 
in the civil war and want to see these places hes going to go 
down there and be standing in a parking lot im fighting for that 
kid says brian pohanka a local historian he was one of 
hundreds protesting the plans on the 127th anniversary of the 
battle in june 
its too late for some places 
factories spew smoke across the james river from shirley 
plantation in charles city county last year 53500 tourists 
visited the plantation built in the 1700s a subdivision has been 
built downriver from the factories 
trees planted across the river in chesterfield county have 
helped some to obscure the sight says charles carter whose family 
lives on the plantation 
tourists are dismayed i have had more than one group of 
english folk who said wed never allow this 
once the historic integrity of an area has been affected it 
doesnt go back the other way 
in waterford residents concerned about development inching west 
from washington formed a compact and are raising money to buy 
property they have asked farmers who own the land surrounding the 
town for the right of refusal when they sell their land says 
katherine ladd director of the waterford foundation the compact 
and its negotiations with developers led to waterford being removed 
from the national trusts list of endangered historic places 
wouldbe restorers of historic property can take advantage of a 
rehabilitation tax credit which allows a onetime federal income 
tax deduction of 20 percent of the federal income tax up to 7000 
brink says 
in virginia the threatened property fund created in 1988 
provides 500000 a year to help restore and save historic 
properties says david j brown executive director of preservation 
alliance of virginia and director of the fund 
the money is used to create a revolving fund to buy properties 
and resell them and to buy easements that restrict what a later 
owner could do with the property 
the state also allows localities to freeze real estate taxes on 
historic property at a lower level 
these kinds of incentives and credits encourage people to go 
ahead and take those risks brown says 
its not feasible to save them all

burt reynolds says it was his own vision of 
how he would like to live if he wasnt an actor that brought about 
creation of the cbs sitcom evening shade 
reynolds had been living in florida with his wife actress loni 
anderson and their son quinton and was looking for a comedy 
about a family in a small southern town that brought him to linda 
bloodworththomason of designing women 
linda wanted to do something about arkansas because shes from 
a little town in arkansas reynolds says i wanted to do comedy 
with somebody special when the word got out that i wanted to do 
halfhour comedy a lot of people responded i talked to a lot of 
people but the projects didnt excite me as much as hers because 
hers was about a family in a small southern town which is exactly 
the way id like to raise my son because i grew up that way 
she asked me what id be if i couldnt be an actor i said a 
teacher or a high school football coach thats the way the 
character evolved 
reynolds best known for hit movies such as smokey and the 
bandit hooper and the cannonball run plays wood newton 
a former pro football player who returns to his hometown in 
arkansas with his wife and three children to coach the high school 
football team 
marilu henner plays his wife charles durning is his best friend 
and ossie davis is the philosophical owner of a barbecue stand and 
the shows narrator it also stars hal holbrook as his 
fatherinlaw and elizabeth ashley as an eccentric aunt 
woods a very familyoriented man who has a wonderful sense of 
humor about himself reynolds said during a rehearsal break at 
cbsmtm studios he loves small town values his teams not 
winning because he doesnt have any material and in arkansas 
winning is very important in football hes not real happy about 
that but he has three wonderful kids and his wife is about to have 
another one 
bloodworththomason also suggested that reynolds try his hand at 
a script 
ive done a lot of rewriting he says id like to very 
much the blank piece of paper just scares me i admire people who 
can sit down and stare at it and do something 
in florida reynolds had starred for two years in the abc 
mystery movie bl stryker 
the show worked but it was the wrong night he says we 
were in the top 20 until abc moved us from monday to saturday the 
decision to move it to saturday was suicide when they did that i 
hit the ground running i started telling people im ready to do a 
halfhour comedy 
for 16 years reynolds concentrated on making movies before 
returning to television his first tv appearance was in 
riverboat in 1959 he was in gunsmoke and later starred in 
hawk and dan august 
after deliverance in 1972 made him a bankable movie star he 
became a boxoffice champion with such hits as the longest 
yard smokey and the bandit semitough hooper and 
the cannonball run but his last hit was best little 
whorehouse in texas in 1982 and his movies slumped at the box 
office after that 
part of the slump can be attributed to rumors that he had aids 
which made it difficult for him to get cast in good movies 
actually he had injured his jaw doing a stunt and it developed 
into temporomandibular joint disorder it caused an inner ear 
problem that affected his balance and it made eating so difficult 
he lost a lot of weight 
for two years i couldnt get a job he says i weighed 145 
pounds i had to take five physicals to get a job i had to take 
the pictures that were offered me i did action pictures because i 
was trying to prove that i was well i did pictures like malone 
heat and rent a cop 
ive never been so brutalized by reviewers i got criticized 
and beat up like crazy they said i was washed up my career was 
over i went to television because i had to ill be back ill be 
back on my terms 
reynolds says he has no fear of taking roles that cast him as an 
older man he played a 65yearold safecracker in breaking in 
i dont care as long as the parts are good whether i play 
somebodys father or grandfather its a question of whether youre 
working if youre working it doesnt matter

les miserables makes more than just money 
the longrunning musical hit helps build careers 
since it first opened on broadway in 1987 the show has given 
nearly a dozen mostly unknown performers a chance to play the 
leading role of jean valjean 
in new york and around the country 10 actors have portrayed the 
heroic valjean starting with colm wilkinson who originated the 
role in london in 1985 wilkinson was followed by country singer 
gary morris the bestknown among the valjean replacements the 
rest in subsequent tours and extended stays in cities like san 
francisco have not been household names 
the part is currently being played on broadway by craig 
schulman and he assumed the role in the classic show business 
style schulman went from the chorus of the musicals first touring 
company to eventually starring in the broadway edition of the show 
the performer first encountered les miserables in october 
1987 when he was hired as an understudy and as a member of the 
ensemble of the first national company he was in the chorus for 
only three months when he took over the lead on tour last january 
schulman graduated to the broadway production 
and the show has led to more offers to sing opera another of 
schulmans amibitions 
les miserables is an opera as far as im concerned 
schulman said the other day in the star dressing room backstage at 
the broadway theater im not doing anything different from what 
ive been training and aspiring to do although i get to show off 
my acting skills more in this show 
so what does he call himelf an opera singer who does musical 
theater or a musical theater performer who does opera hes not 
sure but is happy performing in both worlds 
casting people and producers really do want to pigeonhole you 
into a particular type or a particular category schulman says 
i had four months off last fall to sing hoffmann in the tales of 
hoffmann at virginia opera and the production was very very 
successful 
schulman always wanted to be a performer although he didnt 
know where he was headed 
schulmans first theater job when he hit new york from long 
island in september 1979 was with the light opera of manhattan a 
small troupe specializing in gilbert and sullivan the pay was low 
the conditions primitive but the experience invaluable when 
schulman left two years later he had done some 650 performances 
it was wonderful training he recalls it was the kind of 
place where you realize after a time that if you can work there 
under these conditions you can work anywhere for anyone and 
survive 
schulman left for a tour of the merry widow 
youve heard of busandtruck tours he says this was 
just a bus and we played everything from high school gymnasiums to 
real theaters working with a minimum of scenery and whatever 
lighting was available it was 55 cities in 10 weeks 
he did meet his future wife monica on the tour they were 
married in 1983 and now have two sons 
i decided that operetta was a lot of fun but knew that i 
wasnt going to make a fulltime living at it he says and i 
didnt see myself as a songanddance man for shows like chorus 
line or 42nd street 
he settled down to study opera while working at a temp job and 
an occasional opera role with small companies 
i did my first la boheme for 250 for two weeks of rehearsal 
and three performances he says i also learned a lot about 
supply and demand in this business the producers wound up bringing 
in a harp player who was paid 500 
schulman also auditioned for training programs in opera 
becoming an apprentice at the chautauqua opera near jamestown ny 
he felt he needed the extra training because at age 27 he was 
getting into opera later than most people 
in june 1987 he auditioned for les miserables which had 
opened on broadway four months earlier 
he got the job in the touring company but was undecided 
particularly since he had an offer to sing in manon in 
virginia 
i took a chance on les miserables he says i knew that 
eventually there would be a busandtruck tour and i knew there 
was going to be a los angeles company and i knew that eventually 
they would need replacements for the broadway company 
he was on the road for nearly two years leaving the tour in 
early september 1989 with the guarantee he would open on broadway 
the following january he has been there ever since 
the hardest part about this role is maintaining discipline 
about living my life for the next performance its a very 
difficult role because of my training and my background it 
doesnt hurt me to do it but i need to get a lot of rest and not do 
a lot of anything else 
i get home each night and i go right to bed theres a 
cardinal rule in our house nobody wakes dad until dad is ready to 
get up

carmakers are packing more punch under the hoods 
of their 1991 cars and trucks and are wrestling with ways to 
persuade americas drivers to use it wisely 
the hundreds of new models that us asian and european 
automakers will be showing off late this year and early next year 
are aimed at the us love affair with power on the highway 
perhaps the longestawaited entry into the us market is 
general motors corps saturn car the car i due in showrooms in 
october or november but gm kept the lid on preview peeks at the 
vehicle 
its expected to be priced somewhere between 10000 and 12000 
and compete in the thickest part of the market gm officials have 
said they expect that 80 percent of saturns sales will come from 
traditional import buyers 
but analysts say that remains to be seen 
increased power in 1991 cars comes despite rising fuel prices 
stemming from the middle east crisis actually they say cars have 
made great strides in fuelefficiency since the last big oil crunch 
of the late 1970s 
ford motor co officials in fact like to brag that the lincoln 
continental of today gets just about the same mileage as the ford 
pinto of 1979 a gas sipper of its time 
but with more power automakers also are finding that safety 
sells too chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca has appeared on a 
series of television ads along with accident survivors who thank 
the company for installing air bags in all of its north 
americanmade cars 
the ads say little if anything about air bags being 
supplemental safety devices designed to work in conjunction with 
seat belts 
along with air bags and all in the name of safety new cars 
have automatic seat belts beefed up door structures to absorb more 
shock in a side impact and traction control systems to deter 
skidding 
mercedesbenz in fact has a system that puts on the brakes 
automatically if the cars wheels begin to spin 
nearly all automakers are bragging about more power in their 
vehicles engines in some cases usually with large luxury cars 
that comes from simply larger engines like the engine for general 
motor corps cadillac de ville and fleetwood which goes to 
49liter from a 45liter 
trucks too are getting more powerful the dodge dakota pickup 
gets a 52liter v8 for 1991 the first v8 in a pickup its size 
more often though the extra horsepower is coming from the 
growing number of multivalve engines these are power plants with 
four valves per cylinder instead of the traditional two such 
technology coupled with more efficient fuel delivery systems 
boost horsepower while reducing fuel consumption 
the 5series of bmw cars have the same size engine for 1991 as 
it did for 1990 a 25liter sixcylinder model but with the 
addition of more valves per cylinder horsepower is boosted to 189 
from 168 
another way to boost power from the same size engine is to add a 
turbocharger which boosts air compression entering the engine but 
turbochargers produce higher engine temperatures which can speed 
engine wear 
pontiac has dumped turbochargers from its entire 1991 line the 
31liter turbo engine has been replaced by a 34liter v6 
horsepower rises to 210 from the turbocharged engines 205 
while the cars of the coming year have the capacity to go faster 
quicker automakers also are equipping more with sophisticated 
systems to stop them 
antilock braking systems called abs in the industry can add 
hundreds of dollars to the price of a car but industry watchers 
say abs is an extremely important safety feature which will 
probably be standard equipment on all cars some day 
most drivers north of the masondixon line know that its best 
to gently pump the brakes when slowing down on slippery pavement 
abs systems do that for the driver 
sensors detect when wheels are beginning to lock and send 
signals to the braking system to pulse pressure in the brake lines 
in effect pumping the brakes and avoiding a slide

but all the new technology whether its under the hood at the 
wheel or in the passenger compartment costs money and consumers 
will see it 
prices for 1991 models announced through midseptember will 
rise somewhere between 1 percent and 5 percent depending on 
manufacturer and model 
perhaps the least expensive car on the market for 1991 is the 
yugo gv plus a yugoslav import with a base price of 4435 with a 
little bit of hunting a consumer can find a car that cracks the 
quartermilliondollar mark too 
but these days seeing a new price doesnt necessarily mean a 
carbuyer will actually pay it 
incentives still are lurking around and manufacturers are 
finding it hard to get out of the moneyback business basically 
automakers use incentives to spur sales but to some degree 
consumers demand it 
one auto executive gave an example of how crazy the system has 
become he said that someone who wouldnt touch a car with a 
12000 price tag would be more likely to buy one listed at 13000 
and carrying a 1000 rebate 
manufacturers issue consumer incentives which they advertise 
heavily and dealer incentives which receive little notice with 
dealer incentives manufacturers let dealers decide for themselves 
how to spend the money it may go for increased advertising prizes 
in salesperson contests or may be passed along to the consumer 
it pays consumers to shop around even after theyve decided on 
exactly the car they want going to different dealers representing 
the same manufacturer for the same car can result in some savings 
consumers also can save money by purchasing options in packages 
and for 1991 there are options and gadgets galore 
chrysler has redesigned its popular minivan for 1991 and has 
included not only a cup holder but a juicebox holder other 
options include power everything mobile phones leather seats and 
door panels a compass and double bright neon green windshield 
wipers 
here are summaries of whats new for 1991 from the nations big 
three automakers being unveiled this fall many makers of imported 
cars introduce their 1991 lines later in the year 
gm the companys bestselling division chevrolet is offering 
a newly designed caprice sedan and wagon its sisters are the buick 
roadmaster wagon and a sedan which will be introduced later 
gm has restyled the chevrolet camaro and pontiac firebird for 
1991 and the oldsmobile ninetyeight regency elite and touring 
sedan 
ford the company introduced its 1991 ford escort and mercury 
tracer subcompacts and ford explorer sportutility vehicle earlier 
this year elsewhere the company is upgrading the powertrains in 
some of its most popular vehicles including the ford thunderbird 
taurus and mustang and tempo along with the mercury cougar lincoln 
town car and continental 
on the truck side there are new sport models of fords popular 
fseries fullsize pickups and ranger compact pickups 
chrysler the struggling automaker has redesigned the interior 
and exterior of its popular minivan whose sales make up nearly 
half of all minivans sold in the united states the company also is 
selling its dodge stealth sports car which was engineered by 
chryslers principal japanese partner mitsubishi motors corp 
the company is marketing strippeddown versions of its dodge 
shadow and plymouth sundance cars call the america series as 
stopgaps for a hole left when the chrysler gave up on its dodge 
omni and plymouth horizon subcompacts last february

automakers are finding that safety sells 
for years us automakers have resisted following their 
european cousins by shying away from advertising safety devices in 
their cars thats changing 
us government regulations have caused a big part of the switch 
by requiring passive restraint systems such as air bags or 
automatic seat belts on the driver sides of all usbuilt cars 
beginning with the 1990 model year 
chrysler corp has taken the lead among us companies in 
promoting safety features especially air bags which it supplies 
as standard equipment in all of its north americanmade cars 
initially it was tough getting customers to talk about 
safety chrysler corp spokesman tony cervone says it becomes 
a discriminating factor in buying a car now 
chrysler is devoted part of its advantage chrysler 
advertising campaign to testimonials by survivors of crashes saying 
they owed their lives to air bags 
general motors corp recently announced it will equip all 
usbuilt passenger cars with driversside air bags by the fall 
of 1995 but the company has yet to work them into safetyrelated 
advertising 
company spokesman donald postma says the upscale cadillac 
division is expected to be the first to promote air bags 
ford motor co has air bags in about half its 1990model 
usbuilt vehicles but the company doesnt go to lengths to 
promote them or motorized passive restraint seat belts 
under federal law all cars made in the united states after 
sept 1 1989 must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt 
for drivers and frontseat passengers 
according to insurance institute for highway safety in 
arlington va air bags were equipped in 1 percent of the 
estimated 10 million 1987 model domestic and import cars sold in 
the united states by 1996 90 percent of cars are expected to have 
air bags the institute says 
european carmakers mercedesbenz bmw and volkswagen long have 
incorporated safety promotion into advertising in part because 
buyers ask more questions 
when you deal with a small market niche such as ours is in the 
united states you have to be very attentive to what customers say 
they want in a car says john chuhran a spokesman for 
mercedesbenz of north america in montvale nj 
in one 30second television commercial mercedes which sells 
about 75000 cars a year in the united states promotes its 
standard safety features 
of course you want a safe car for your family but what is 
safe well only your authorized mercedesbenz dealer offers a 
system with driversside air bag and antilock brakes on every 
new model standard thats safe the announcer says 
an air bag usually concealed in the steering wheel inflates 
within a tenth of a second upon a headon impact or one 30 degrees 
to the left or right of center of the car air bags are devices 
designed to be used in addition to lap and shoulder seat belts 
automakers acknowledge that air bags add no safety margin to 
side or rear impact accidents 
in terms of advertising says mercedesbenzs chuhran 
safety is a relative term there is no such thing as an 
absolutely safe automobile

imagine yourself behind the wheel of your powerful new 
automobile speeding along the autobahn at 80 miles an hour 
that fantasy can become reality through various overseas 
delivery plans offered by european auto manufacturers including 
volvo bmw mercedesbenz saab audi volkswagen and others 
you order a europeanmade car from your local dealer travel to 
europe to pick it up and drive it around during your vacation 
before having it shipped home 
european cars cost about 10 percent less in their countries of 
origin the difference in price plus savings on auto rental in 
europe might cover the cost of a european vacation or business 
trip 
for example youll pay 20931 for a 1990 audi quattro 
fivespeed sport sedan if you pick it up in west germany compared 
to the 22800 list price in the us mercedesbenz will offer you 
a topoftheline 560 sec sports coupe at 73350 compared with 
the 81500 us price tag the company estimates that if you 
rented the same car for a month youd pay 5600 
some us dealers offer deep discounts almost equalling european 
prices but they cant match travel incentives 
overseas delivery plans offered only to us residents require 
customers to order and prepay before leaving for europe 
personally pick up cars with documents and passport in hand and 
within a specified time period ship cars home to local dealers 
where cars can be picked up eight to 10 weeks later 
a key attraction is getting the most appealing make and model 
but with varied overseas delivery plans there are added factors to 
consider 
most plans cover factory preparation shortterm registration 
service and insurance in europe which may be extended up to one 
year at additional cost inland shipping from dropoff points to 
port conversion to us standards emissions and white instead of 
yellow head lights for example ocean freight marine insurance 
us documentation fees customs clearance and shipping to your 
dealer us duties may or may not be covered so its worth 
checking 
some plans provide free or discounted transatlantic airfare 
hotel accommodations meals maps tripplanning services and 
other incentives to sweeten the deal one of volvos plans provides 
one free ticket on sas to gothenburg sweden with a second ticket 
available for 499 round trip bmw and mercedesbenz also offer 
discounted airfares to munich and stuttgart respectively 
all three manufacturers provide an overnight stay in a luxury 
hotel with continental breakfasts and luncheons or rest and 
shower facilities at delivery centers purchasers also get factory 
tours 
some manufacturers have one pickup point others have several 
some with additional charges similarly numbers and locations of 
dropoff points for export vary 
bmws must be picked up at freimann delivery center about 20 
minutes by taxi bmw pays cab fare from munich but they may be 
dropped off at 19 places in 11 countries mercedesbenz delivery is 
at sindelfingen near stuttgart but there are 28 free dropoff 
points around europe 
volvos gothenburg center gives free car ferry transport from 
sweden to germany denmark or england or at additional cost 
volvos are delivered at a dozen centers throughout continental 
europe and great britain free dropoff points are at gothenburg 
antwerp or bremerhaven with 20 additional european dropoffs at 
additional charge 
volkswagens various centers deliver different car models 
vanagon at hannover jetta and passat at wolfsburg cabriolet and 
corrado at osnabrueck peugeot delivers cars to paris airports 
alfa romeo delivers near frankfurt to avoid italian auto 
registration red tape 
manufacturers require different lead times two weeks to a 
months notice is usual mercedesbenz tries to accommodate 
lastminute shoppers while porsche delivered at zuffenhausen 
near stuttgart needs a years lead with sufficient time cars are 
prepared to specification otherwise standard vehicles are 
available 
before buying comparison shop through local dealers for the 
make model and plan that suit your needs 
enjoy the autobahn but remember that when you get home its 
back to a safe 55 mph on us roads

the days of wild swings in gasoline prices are 
just a mideast crisis away during the first three weeks of the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait gasoline prices rose an average of a 
penny a day 
consumers who cant reduce their driving and plan to keep their 
current car for a while still can cut fuel costs by using a little 
common sense and spending a little time on their vehicle 
one of the best ways to conserve gasoline is to organize a 
driving route before starting out if planned carefully a driver 
can avoid backtracking which wastes gasolineand time 
also choose a time of day when traffic is lightest to avoid 
getting involved in any fuelwasting traffic jams 
the united states auto club of dallas says trips of five miles 
or less make up 15 percent of the driving in the united states and 
consume 30 percent of all fuel 
planning also pays off when getting ready for a trip the less 
packed into the trunk the less weight the car has to haul try to 
avoid rooftop loads which increase wind resistance and gobble fuel 
proper maintenance of a vehicle also can save gallons of 
gasoline keep tires inflated to recommended pressures be sure the 
air filter is clean keep the engine tuned and change oil according 
to the manufacturers recommendations 
when a car needs maintenance it typically will use 5 
percent to 25 percent more gas than when its wellcared for 
says ken lehman chairman of the car care council in port clinton 
ohio 
once on the road motorists can get more miles per gallon by 
driving sensibly the us auto club and vehicle manufacturers 
offer these fuelefficient driving tips 
after starting the car in cold weather let it warm up no 
longer than 30 seconds when driving with a cold or cool engine 
avoid sudden accelerations if possible 
allow the car to idle for no more than a minute or two 
waiting in a drivein bank line or at a railroad crossing with a 
long train crawling by can eat fuel needlessly 
avoid quick accelerating or braking 
use the same foot to control the accelerator and the brake 
which would eliminate the possibility of riding the brake 
drive at steady speeds whenever possible 
use the air conditioner for highway driving but turn it off 
and open the windows at lower speeds according to general motors 
corp air drag created by open windows at 50 mph or more can cause 
more fuel consumption than the extra gas used when an air 
conditioner is on and windows are closed

one of the major costs and one of the most 
confusing issues for any motorist these days is insurance 
when choosing or updating an insurance policy dozens of 
questions can come up how much coverage is enough how can i 
reduce my rates should i change my insurance carrier 
one of the best ways to cut your insurance costs is to drive 
carefully aaa michigan says being ticketed for running one stop 
sign and being at fault in one accident during a threeyear period 
can boost rates by 40 percent 
the car thats being insured also has a big effect on premiums 
says greg vartanoff actuarial director for aaa michigan one of 
the states largest automobile insurers a family car will be 
insured less expensively than a sports car 
a 1990 chevrolet lumina has a base price of around 12000 
but its insured as a 10000 vehicle he said a 1990 camaro 
iroc has a base price of about 14000 but its insured as a 
30000 vehicle 
another way to cut insurance costs is to shop around insurance 
laws sometimes change which can affect the amount you pay changes 
in levels of coverage or deductibles for example can raise or 
lower your premiums 
perhaps the only time a motorist actually looks over an 
insurance policy is at newcar buying time along with sticker 
shock at the dealership a driver may be shocked to discover 
changes in insurance costs 
new cars cost more to insure than old cars simply because 
theyre worth more 
but many of todays cars come with safety features that can 
slash insurance costs air bags automatic seat belts and antilock 
brakes can cut them too sometimes by considerable amounts 
antitheft devices such as alarms and stolenvehicle tracking 
systems also can save some money in some states 
if you have an active device that requires some sort of manual 
action you get a 5 percent deduction in comprehensive coverage 
vartanoff said a passive device you can get a 10 percent 
deduction 
he said one of the easiest ways to reduce costs is to increase 
deductibles or the amount of money a customer is willing to pay 
for vehicle repairs before insurance money kicks in 
if you increase the comprehensive deductible from the 
mandatory 50 to 200 you save 15 percent vartanoff said and 
to 250 deductible it would be up to 30 percent 
here is a brief vocabulary of car insurance terms some forms of 
coverage are mandatory others optional check with state laws 
liability coverage divided into two subcategories bodily 
injury and property damage bodily injury in turn is divided into 
two groups per person and per accident with dollar limits to 
each this bodily injury coverage is frequently referred to as 
2040 for example meaning 20000 limit per person and 40000 
limit per accident property damage liability is listed on a per 
accident basis also with limits states establish minimum liability 
coverages 
uninsured motorists covers your injuries caused by an 
uninsured motorist limits also are on a per person and per 
accident basis 
collision protects the vehicle up to its market value 
deductibles are paid by the policy holder the higher the 
deductible the lower the premium 
comprehensive protects the vehicle against mishaps other than 
collision such as fire theft flood and so on deductibles also 
are common in comprehensive protection 
car rental provides financial help for a motorist who needs 
to rent a car while his own is being repaired 
death indemnity provides a onetime payment to the estate of 
the policyholder or spouse when an accident results in death 
property protection protects the policyholder for damage to 
another vehicle when the policyholder is negligent provided the 
other car does not have collision coverage

entrusting an 18000 car to a teenager streaked with axle 
grease is perhaps a motorists worst nightmare short of an 
accident 
choosing a mechanic to keep a car in top running order is a 
difficult task for the average car owner 
everyone has heard horror stories featuring technical 
mumbojumbo like the chugachuga youre hearing is coming from 
the doublebackflip overwhammy assembly it needs a new 
razzenhelter and thatll cost you about 300 bucks 
anxiety can be dispelled by making a few telephone calls taking 
a quick glance on a repair shops walls and asking some questions 
before you take your car to an unknown fixit shop check with 
friends to see where they take their vehicles its best 
obviously to find someone with a car like yours at least from 
the same manufacturer 
there are a growing number of repair boutiques specializing 
in a particular part of a car such as the exhaust system 
suspension or transmission these can be a good bet for repair 
work 
many of these shops are located in shoppingcentertype strips 
according to car care mall news about 1200 of these centers are 
operating in the united states and canada and the number is 
growing 
after youve selected a shop whether a specialty or a general 
repair one check for certification of the business and the 
mechanics working there 
the american automobile association periodically checks the 
businesses it certifies and mechanics can qualify for 
certification through the national institute for automotive service 
excellence 
a mechanic must have two years experience before ase 
certification is possible the organization holds tests twice a 
year nationwide which determine whether a technician will be 
certified 
a written certification is not a guarantee that a mechanic is 
competent but it indicates that the technician has passed an 
examination 
before work is performed its best to insist on a written 
estimate of the problem and its expected cost many states require 
such an estimate when major repairs are involved get several 
estimates something an insurance company may require anyway 
after the work is done inspect the parts that have been 
replaced and have the mechanic explain what went wrong again some 
states require that shops offer the consumer the old parts 
finally closely examine the bill to be sure that all costs 
parts and labor are itemized

the federal government is cracking down on 
phonies in the automobile repair business not the grease monkeys 
who pretend they know something but really dont but the 
replacement parts mechanics put in your car 
automakers have complained that the bogus parts not only rob 
them of about 3 billion a year but could cause severe accidents 
federal officials have said some of the fake parts theyve 
discovered include some highvolume ones such as oil filters brake 
pads and shoes and antifreeze 
the danger they say is that because repairs or maintenance 
involving these parts is so routine a consumer may not check to be 
sure that the parts are exactly what should be going on or into the 
car 
during the past year the fbi staged a 15state raid on dozens 
of businesses looking for counterfeit general motors corp parts 
some of the parts that have showed up in the past included oil 
filters with rags jammed into perforated food cans and brake 
linings made of compressed wood chips and cardboard 
to combat the problem gm has been testing the use of holograms 
on packages of its genuine parts a consumer sees a mirrorlike 
square on the outside of the box that shows a multicolor gm logo 
when turned slightly 
making and marketing counterfeit parts is a federal offense 
through trademark infringement 
new york attorney milton springut said there are four basic ways 
trademarks are violated 
repair shops claim they are authorized by of associated with 
an auto manufacturer 
usedcar dealers portray themselves as authorized dealers for 
a particular manufacturer 
parts are sold in packages containing counterfeit or 
lookalike trademarks of the automakers 
unlicensed parts are sold with the manufacturers trademark 
there is nothing wrong with making or selling a replacement part 
for a particular vehicle as long as that part doesnt pretend to be 
from the original manufacturer 
for example theres nothing wrong with selling a fan belt made 
by the fictitious xyz corp for a particular dodge car as long as 
the xyz corp doesnt try to pass itself off as dodge division of 
chrysler corp 
automakers have trademarks on a variety of materials and often 
go to court to protect them for example a company was barred by a 
court from making a rollsroycelooking grille and flying lady 
emblem for volkswagen cars springut said the court ruled that the 
company violated rollsroyces trademarks on its grille and emblem

youve just paid about 75 for that snazzy 
clearcoat finish on your new car and its so deep looking that 
you think you could stick your hand into the hood before touching 
metal 
so with good reasons investment and pride you want to keep 
the car looking new even after its had a year of getting beat up 
by sun sand and snowy slush 
there are three basic ways of keeping your car clean 
do it yourself and spend the better part of a summer afternoon 
getting a little damp but taking the time to be sure the vehicle is 
really clean 
run it through a professional car wash in a fraction of the 
time but with less personal satisfaction 
take it to your favorite fundraiser in a parking lot 
somewhere with a bunch of kids intent on soaking each other turned 
loose on your 18000 pride and joy with highpressure water 
unknown solvents and sometimes questionable ability 
it may not be much of a choice but its a necessary evil 
a wellkept car has a higher resale value and some people 
insist that a clean car runs better than a dirty one but sometimes 
the best of intentions to keep a car looking spiffy can produce 
disastrous results 
car wax and polish makers have some advice for keeping a cars 
luster through the years for people who like to do it themselves 
through the years paint oxidizes as its exposed to air waxes 
and acrylic clearcoat finishes protect the paint from 
oxidation which can dull the color 
nonabrasive waxes are best for new or relatively new finishes 
especially clearcoat ones they help clean surfaces and bring 
out the shine in a finish 
if a wax with abrasives is used on a new clearcoat finish 
it can scratch the acrylic dulling the finish and leaving tracks 
of your cloth 
after the car turns a year old turtle wax inc recommends a 
regular wax containing cleaners can be used the cleaners strip 
away oxidation allowing wax to cover and protect the paint 
folks who prefer to take their vehicles to commercial car washes 
should ask what kinds of soaps solvents and waxes are used the 
international carwash association says its members use soaps milder 
than those normally used in athome washings use less water than 
driveway washes and dispose of dirt and soapladen water according 
to environmental regulations 
it also says participating car washes change the mixtures of its 
soaps and additives to match the time of year more bug lifters in 
the summer and more salt dissolvers in the winter 
everyone agrees that the most important time to wash a car is 
right after rain or snow storms when it may have picked up 
sulfuric acids and road salts that can damage its finish

youre driving down a lonely highway at night not 
long after a snow storm the road appears to be clear of snow but 
suddenly without warning your car begins sliding sideways as it 
hits a patch of ice 
what to do 
all driving instructors and manufacturers say the first rule is 
not to panic sure easy right 
perhaps the best way to avoid panic and get the car back under 
control is to go through a quick mental checklist and take 
immediate but gentle actions 
saabscania ab the swedish automaker has published a book 
winter motoring with all kinds of tips for wintertime driving 
the swedish get a lot of practice driving in snow and ice so the 
recommendations are based on wide experience 
if your cars rear wheels are the ones skidding steer the front 
wheels in the direction the rear wheels are going in other words 
if the rear of the car is skidding toward the drivers side steer 
left 
it doesnt matter if your car is front or rearwheeldrive for 
this maneuver 
at the same time push in the clutch on a standard transmission 
or ease up on the gas pedal on a car with an automatic 
transmission after the rear wheels stop skidding gently turn the 
steering wheel back to bring the front wheels to point straight 
ahead 
heres where the difference between a frontwheeldrive and a 
rearwheeldrive pops up 
on a rearwheeldrive car the rear wheels may begin to skid in 
the other direction chances are the skid wont be as severe so a 
driver neednt turn the steering wheel as far the other way to slow 
the skid remember use gentle turns 
on a frontwheeldrive car a skid in a new direction isnt 
nearly as likely if the initial correction was done carefully 
after the skid stops slowly release the clutch or gently 
depress the accelerator so the engine speed matches the road speed 
accelerate gradually 
frontwheel skids are far less common and less difficult to 
control saab recommends that the driver not move the steering 
wheel 
depress the clutch pedal on a car with a standard transmission 
or ease up on the accelerator on a car with an automatic 
transmission since the front wheels are skidding sideways they 
perform a kind of braking effect by themselves 
wait for the front wheels to grip again and when they do gently 
steer the car back on track slowly release the clutch or gently 
depress the accelerator to get going again 
after everything is under control again and your heart returns 
to its normal pace slow down a bit then when you accelerate 
brake or steer do it gently no sudden starts or stops or quick 
turns 
remember that going too fast for conditions was the reason the 
car began skidding in the first place

the worst enemies of automobile tires are underinflation 
outofbalance wheels and bad driving habits 
being aware of these problems can lengthen the life of your 
tires according to experts at goodyear tire and rubber co 
tires should be inflated to the pressure recommended by the 
manufacturer of your car advises frederick j kovak vice 
president of tire technology of the akron ohiobased company 
the most important part of tire care is air 
an underinflated tire generates excessive heat which reduces 
fuel economy and increases tread wear in the shoulder area the 
company points out adding that inflating your tires to but not 
over the maximum inflation pressure specified on the tire 
sidewall can improve fuel economy and extend tire life 
if the car is carrying extra weight such as luggage on a 
vacation trip a little additional air should be added to the tires 
preferably four pounds over the car manufacturers recommended 
cold tire pressure 
outofbalance wheels definitely can rob tires of thousand of 
miles goodyear notes 
for a tire to run true weight of the tire and wheel assembly 
must be distributed uniformly kovak cautions a heavy spot in 
the tire and wheel assembly must be counterbalanced by 
precisionmade wheel weights 
improper balance could lead to cupping and excessive wear of 
the tread at the heavy spot the tread will eventually cup out to 
the point where the tire will no longer be usable 
driving habits can shorten the life of tires kovak says some 
handling advice 
dont speed excessive heat is generated from the flexing 
of the tires carcass when driven at high speeds this heat 
increases the rate of tire wear and reduces the tires 
durability 
avoid fast turns on curves and around corners fast starts and 
panic stops riding on the edge of the pavement and driving over 
curbs chuckholes or other obstructions 
also recommended for automobiles and light trucks is tire 
rotation at 6000 to 8000 miles and again at 18000 to 24000 
miles unless the vehicle manufacturer advises otherwise 
rotation a couple of times during tire life usually will mean 
more even treadwear particularly for frontwheel and 
fourwheeldrive cars and light trucks notes fred caraway 
goodyears manager of product service 
basic rotation technique involves a simple x pattern he 
explains 
on frontwheeldrive vehicles the left rear tire goes to the 
right front and the right rear tire to the left front front tires 
move straight to the rear the reverse applies to rearwheeldrive 
vehicles

history buffs are running out of gas in 
their quest to buy a rare 92yearold threewheeled automobile 
they view as a monument to two peoria men they consider the fathers 
of the american automobile 
after two years of unsuccessful fund raising the bring home the 
duryea committee has shifted gears in a desperate bid to prevent 
the 1898 duryea motor trap from being sold to japanese collectors 
the committee is trying to raffle off a new 56000 cadillac 
allante to save the luxury cars vintage ancestor the duryea trap 
which was built in a peoria barn nearly a century ago and 
originally sold for 1200 
the group is selling 100 chances at 1000 each for an oct 6 
drawing 
weve raised 70000 and we need 125000 by nov 1 or were 
going to lose the car said john parks a leader of the effort to 
save the duryea motor trap built in peoria by charles edgar duryea 
in 1898 
its frustrating because this car will be lost forever if we 
dont raise the money parks said people dont seem to be 
excited about it maybe because weve paid so little attention to 
history in peoria over the years 
the trap was the brainchild of duryea who with his brother j 
frank duryea in 1893 built the first american gasolinepowered 
automobile now in the smithsonian institution 
about 12 traps were built in the peoria area in 189890 just 
two remain and one is in the henry ford museum in greenfield 
village mich the other is owned by l scott bailey founder of 
automobile quarterly magazine 
bailey has offered to sell the car to peoria but after two 
years of work the committee is far short of its goal 
mr bailey has had offers of 250000 from japanese collectors 
for the car and i think he regrets agreeing to sell it to us 
parks said but he really believes it belongs back in peoria 
we do too but its been hard to get people interested in this 
project its not something that pulls at your heartstrings maybe 
weve been poor at approaching people 
parks criticized the peoria historical society for failing to 
assume leadership in the project 
im disappointed that a lot of different organizations havent 
been more active area car dealers have shown very little interest 
i thought theyd be a natural group to help us parks said 
and the peoria historical society as a group has done 
nothing for us we hoped some benevolent person in the community 
would want their name on this forever and step forward to become 
our major contributor but that hasnt happened either 
dorothy sinclair who retired two months ago as the historical 
societys director defended her groups role in the project 
it would be most unfortunate if we lost it said mrs 
sinclair a member of the peoria city council 
but in my opinion it has not been a wellthoughtout 
fundraising campaign she said i dont think they have 
approached the right people to get the money 
its not too late i think it could still be done if the right 
people get involved 
mrs sinclair said the society operates on a small budget and 
lacks the resources for the duryea project 
tom leiter the societys president called the criticism 
highly inappropriate he said his group is firmly behind the 
project 
the problem raising money is that some people dont care about 
antiques leiter said some view this as just an old car they 
dont get very excited about it its not fair to criticize people 
because they have other priorities

if youre boiling mad or upset about 
something the last thing you should do is get behind the wheel of 
your car 
rolling down the road in an attempt to release pentup emotions 
and frustrations is tempting but dangerous says dr george 
guthrey clinical professor of psychiatry at the university of 
oklahoma 
with all the power associated with the automobile even the 
most frail person can become a raging dynamo when he or she gets 
behind the wheel of a powerful car he says and if youre 
driving while sad or depressed your concentration and thinking are 
impaired he adds 
deal with your emotions by going for a walk or a jog he 
advises or move into another room watch television or call a 
friend 
if driving is necessary have a definite destination planned 
such as the grocery store or fastfood restaurant but not the 
neighborhood bar 
traffic itself may instigate anger but guthrey points out that 
it doesnt do any good to get riled about something you cant do 
anything about instead of attempting to provoke someone who has 
cut in front of you keep your emotions in check and give them a 
friendly wave of the hand instead

as a driver you shouldnt overlook maintenance of two of your 
most vital safety devices your eyes 
while you may have passed your licence bureaus eye test some 
subtle but important vision problems may have gone undetected says 
the american optometric association getting a more comprehensive 
professional examination wont force you to give up driving the 
organization says rather it will assure that you will drive more 
safely 
some things that your optometrist or opthamologist will assess 
distance vision while most states require 2040 visual 
acuity the measurement is made when you are standing still when 
youre in a moving car your acuity can change 
night vision you cant see as well at night and your accuity 
may drop from 2040 to 2060 after dark you also must be able to 
adapt quickly to potential blinding effects of oncoming headlights 
depth perception you need to be able to judge precisely the 
distance between your car and those in front or back of you on the 
road and those approaching from other angles 
peripheral awareness this means your ability to detect 
objects and movement at the sides of your focal path its 
essential to spot pedestrians and other vehicles and it helps you 
keep in the proper lane 
focal change you should be able to switch your focus quickly 
between the road and dashboard and back again 
color perception obviously you need to recognize traffic 
signals and signs by color as well as shape but color also adds to 
your perception of people objects and other cars

every so often aides at the 
alzheimers center of western michigan replace the snapshots that 
hang next to the doorway of each bedroom gentle reminders to help 
guide residents 
instead of substituting updated portraits the aides tack up 
photographs portraying the graying men and women in their youth 
it is a clear sign of the devastating effects of the disease 
which first steals its victims shortterm memory 
they remember themselves not as they are but as they were 
administrator lynne bylsma said she stands in front of a room 
whose occupant is identified by a photograph of himself as a 
handsome world war ii soldier 
it is the same symptom that wipes out knowledge of children and 
grandchildren but leaves childhood memories intact 
its like a living death bylsma said sometimes we have 
to remove the mirrors in their rooms because they no longer 
recognize the person looking back at them and its upsetting to 
them 
the center which opened in april and accommodates 20 residents 
represents a trend in facilities that advertise as being designed 
for alzheimers patients 
many experts say traditional nursing homes often plagued by 
space and staff shortages are inappropriate for alzheimers 
patients especially those who are physically fit the memory loss 
is accompanied by increased irritability and a tendency to wander 
there have been accusations of alzheimers patients being strapped 
down or oversedated 
it is widely believed that such patients fare better in more 
intimate homelike settings with specially trained staffs safety 
precautions and more individual attention 
what you want is a place that can be flexible thats not 
going to take a cookiecutter approach said deborah beitler 
director of state policy and chapter advocacy of the chicagobased 
alzheimers association 
but as more facilities advertise as alzheimer specialists 
patient advocates worry about potential abuses 
nobody knows how many such homes exist because there are no 
licensing standards governing them as there are with nursing 
homes according to the alzheimers association 
pretty much anyone can put out a sign and call themselves an 
alzheimers center said ann steslicki executive director of the 
associations westcentral michigan chapter 
the alzheimers center in grand rapids is licensed by the state 
as an adult foster care home that means it can operate without 
skilled nursing personnel but cannot treat patients requiring 
extensive medical care 
sufferers of the disease most of whom are over 65 sometimes 
linger for decades as the disease progresses from forgetfulness to 
loss of speech and bodily functions an estimated 4 million 
americans have alzheimers 
a private room at the center costs 2500 a month insurance 
rarely pays for such longterm care 
the modern onesory building is part of a treeshaded 
retirement village 
there is a fencedin yard with a concrete path and buzzers on 
each door leading outside alert nurses aides as residents come and 
go 
pale carpeting in the spacious dining room is circled by a 
bright red border which residents are encouraged to walk to 
relieve anxiety the halls are colorcoded to help residents find 
their way 
staffing ratios are five residents per nurses aide a licensed 
practical nurse is on hand during the day there are memory therapy 
sessions daily exercise routines and field trips 
studies are under way to determine whether such activities help 
to delay the most crippling stages of the disease 
shirley leitz of kentwood said shes impressed with the care her 
77yearold mother receives but is unsure about the benefits of the 
specialized program 
this place is so much more than having fencing in the yard 
leitz said i appreciate that they encourage her to do as much as 
she can by herself because once something is unlearned she wont 
ever learn it again 
however sometimes when leitz visits she finds her mother 
wearing pajamas on top of her regular clothes or several layers of 
blouses and pants 
she is turning into a child leitz acknowledges its hard 
to think of the day when ill walk in and she wont recognize me 
until an accreditation system is created for alzheimers homes 
the alzheimers association urges caution for families seeking care 
for a relative with the disease the association provides guidance 
to consumers about what to look for 
while adult fostercare homes have relatively low supervision 
standards many retirement villages and senior citizen centers that 
are not regulated at all have also begun advertising as alzheimers 
units officials say 
we know that some people out there are going to be primarily 
motivated by profit and will prey on families who are under a 
tremendous amount of stress and particularly vulnerable said 
beitler of the alzheimers association there definitely is that 
fear on the consumers part and its a justified one 
janet lewis a supervisor for the michigan department of social 
services adult foster care licensing division said the department 
is limited in policing group homes because the department has no 
alzheimers experts 
as long as they dont advertise nursing care they can call 
themselves whatever they like she said 
meanwhile more nursing homes are setting aside beds or adding 
wings designed for alzheimers patients 
in 1987 53800 nursing home beds or 33 percent of the 
nationwide total of 16 million were set aside for alzheimers 
patients by 1991 that number will almost double to about 100000 
according to the us department of health and human services 
ultimately our goal is to have all nursing facilities improve 
to a point where they would be appropriate for alzheimers 
patients said stephen mcconnell the associations vice 
president of public policy if youre taking good care of an 
alzheimers patient then youre probably taking good care of other 
patients as well

when choosing a facility for an alzheimers patient a nursing 
home or a group home officials with the alzheimers association 
recommend that you call a local chapter or your communitys agency 
on aging for specific guidelines 
there are 209 alzheimers association chapters nationwide with 
at least one in every state except alaska the national 
headquarters may be reached by calling 18006210379 
according to the group relatives should review the facilitys 
reputation in the community and inspect the following 
licensing what sort of license does the facility have and 
what are the state standards for that try to find out about the 
facilitys owners 
medical care if the patient is in the later stages of the 
disease or in need of extensive medical treatment does the 
facility have skilled nursing personnel are medical personnel on 
call 24 hours 
staff training stafftopatient ratios have staff members 
been specially trained to work with alzheimers residents a staff 
ratio of four or five patients to one staff member is usually 
sufficient 
safety are residents allowed to go outside by themselves if 
so is there fencing or some sort of deterrent to keep them from 
wandering away fulltime supervision is recommended 
recreation therapy nutrition are there programs designed 
for alzheimers patients to keep them active productive and 
physically healthy 
is it easy for the patient to get around the facility or does 
it have a confusing layout 
is the facility affiliated with an university or research 
organization

when jack lalanne opened the nations 
first health club during the depression he was labeled a charlatan 
for promoting daily exercise and organic food 
he didnt quit then and hes not quitting now at 75 lalannes 
enthusiasm for health remains as solid as his sinewy physique 
time has leathered his face and his dark wavy locks are 
threaded with gray yet the firebrand of the physical fitness 
revolution has the body of a man 20 years his junior and an 
attitude that is ageless 
i never think of my age never said lalanne i could be 
20 or 100 i never think about it im just me look at bob hope 
george burns theyre more productive than theyve ever been in 
their whole lives right now 
fellow muscleman arnold schwarzenegger chairman of the 
presidents council on physical fitness and sports credits lalanne 
with taking exercise out of the gymnasium and into living rooms 
with his television show that was broadcast for some 30 years 
he laid the groundwork for others to have exercise programs 
and now it has bloomed from that black and white program into a 
very colorful enterprise schwarzenegger said in a telephone 
interview 
jack was first on my list to come to the white house for a 
may 1 great american workout fitness party schwarzenegger 
recalled i told him i wouldnt celebrate this event without 
your being here because youre responsible for everything thats 
happened in the world of fitness 
lalanne follows a daily routine that usually consists of two 
hours of weightlifting and an hour in the swimming pool 
its a lifestyle its something you do the rest of your 
life said lalanne whose newest passion is golf how long are 
you going to keep breathing how long do you keep eating you just 
do it 
he has built two gyms at his home nestled in a golden hill above 
morro bay in central california the one furnished with equipment 
he designed 50 years ago could be considered a museum said elaine 
his wife of 31 years 
the lalannes moved to morro bay from their hollywood hills home 
four years ago to escape smogplagued los angeles their threeacre 
plot includes a chicken coop a greenhouse an aviary with parrots 
and parakeets and a covey of statues including david and the 
discus thrower 
in the garage is a curvaceous blue corvette that lalanne drives 
when not jetting around the country preaching the gospel of good 
health by way of lectures titled sex at 70 more fun than ever 
and dont let your next meal go to waist 
mrs lalanne 64 recently published elaine lalannes fitness 
after 50 workout and her husband has written six books promoting 
a healthy lifestyle and is writing an autobiography 
when the lalannes met elaine was a chain smoker and a junkfood 
junkie she soon was transformed into a walking testimonial to the 
lalanne program 
the couple has a 29yearold son jon who tends bar in malibu 
jack has a daughter from a previous marriage yvonne 45 a 
chiropractor and elaine has a son dan 41 a forensic 
photographer 
like his wife lalanne was not always the picture of health 
the son of poor french immigrants he was born in oakland in 
1914 and grew up to become a sugarholic he said 
the turning point occurred one night when he heard a lecture by 
pioneering nutritionist paul bragg who advocated the benefits of 
brown rice whole wheat and a vegetarian diet 
he got me so enthused lalanne said after the lecture i 
went to his dressing room and spent an hour and a half with him he 
said jack youre a walking garbage can 
soon after lalanne constructed a makeshift gym in his backyard 
i had all these firemen and police working out there and i kind 
of used them as guinea pigs he said 
at 21 he opened the first of his 100 health clubs in 
california new jersey and new york he doled out 45 a month to 
rent space on the third floor of an oakland office building 
the doctors were against me lalanne said they said 
dont go to that jack lalanne guy or youll get a heart attack 
hemorrhoids youll lose your sex drive if youre athletes you 
wont be able to throw the ball and you women will look like men 
 
lalanne began taking chiropractic lessons and giving massages to 
pay the rent he proved himself by taking on poorly conditioned 
high school students 
word got around and everyone began saying how i took the kids 
and turned them into superboys he said 
eventually his popularity grew and he had his own nationally 
syndicated show it aired from 1951 to 1971 and was brought back 
for a few years in the early 1980s 
since then he has produced a couple of workout videos 
the latest video assembled by both lalannes is a commemorative 
tape of four black and white vintage shows lalanne appears in his 
trademark skintight jumpsuits one of which is on display at the 
smithsonian institution in washington dc 
the fitness clubs now are owned by another company 
when asked how hed like to celebrate his 76th birthday on sept 
26 lalanne said hed like to swim the 26 miles from catalina 
island to los angeles under water its never been done

a swatch of denim a cowbell or a circus 
poster may be all it takes to prompt memories that preserve the 
past 
its talking about life memories need to be shared whether 
good or bad and we should listen to what elderly people have to 
say and why its important said kathryn leide who with her 
partner have developed kits intended to stir up the past and stir 
the recollections of older men and women 
their kits cover such themes as county fairs the depression 
the home front farm days school days work life train rides and 
aprons 
the kits described as a multisensory multimedia approach to 
reaching the elderly and others contain videotape cassettes 
slides song books fabrics scent cards and items such as 
rationing stamps sports pennants old train schedules and circus 
posters 
ms leide and lynne erickson organized their nonprofit 
corporation bifolkal productions inc of madison about 14 years 
ago they sell or rent about 300000 worth of kits a year 
they first sold the kits to libraries then expanded to nursing 
homes prisons colleges state hospitals and day care centers 
around the country

dick countryman practices squareinch gardening 
except for a few necessary paths his 30by50foot backyard is in 
nearly yearround production of vegetables and flowers 
plants in containers also fill most nooks and crannies and an 
enclosing 6foot wall supports climbers 
theres no road map wherever and whenever i have room to 
plant something i do it he says i dont believe in allowing 
ground to go fallow 
countryman feels his garden proves it isnt necessary to have a 
large plot to grow a constant supply of fresh vegetables and cut 
flowers hes been cultivating it more than 25 years now 64 and 
retired he thinks its a shame more people particularly retirees 
dont grow vegetables and flowers 
the big thing is to work at your own pace and avoid 
disappointment by first learning and then following the basic 
techniques he says he advises beginners to start small and 
dont try to do everything at once and estimates a 4foot by 
8foot vegetable garden is enough for one persons needs 
an august visitor counted at least 70 varieties of flowers 
about half of them in bloom there were more than 40 types of 
vegetables the vegetable count lumps as one type five varieties of 
tomatoes six of peppers three of cucumbers three of garlic 
three of onions and three of squash there were even 24 stalks of 
sweet corn 
i like pretty flowers i like nutritious fresh vegetables i 
like to experiment a lot of things i grow just to see if i can 
grow them countryman says by way of explanation 
his theory is to keep the ground in constant production 
its also moving the plants around crop rotation so you 
dont build up any diseases 
while there are perennials such as a strawberry patch most 
plants are pulled out as soon as they complete their cycle 
i might go in here with mutiplier onions or i might go in 
there with head lettuce or flowers or whatever he says 
the 100squarefoot strawberry bed always has been in the same 
place runners are used from time to time to replace older plants 
of course the bed produced berries ozark beauty and sequoia from 
december into july this year 
flowers are just as likely to follow vegetables as vegetables to 
follow flowers but the bulk of the vegetable production because 
of the desert climate and tripledigit summer temperatures in this 
phoenix suburb begins in the fall 
he has few worries about frost 
i can cut a fresh bouquet of flowers or gather fresh 
vegetables every day of the year he says 
while the intensive approach may seem unorthodox countrymans 
credentials are impeccable he retired recently as assistant 
director of the state horticultural and agricultural commission is 
a horticultural graduate from the university of arizona and is in 
frequent demand as a speaker on gardening subjects 
preparation of the planting bed is the secret he says do 
it right and youll have a reasonable amount of success 
for 100 square feet he covers it 4 inches deep with organic 
matter such as mulch and sprinkles two pounds of ammonium 
phosphate 16200 and five pounds of gypsum on top before turning 
it in twice the gypsum is used to counteract salt in local water 
gardeners in other areas may find lime or soil sulphur work better 
countryman seldom uses chemical pesticides finding that insects 
and diseases rarely bother healthy plants 
his planting beds are arranged so the watering bubbler system 
applies two inches uniformly every four days much of the year 
adequate water and healthy plants keep weeds to the minimum 
he says 
he has plants in more thsn 200 pots they range from miniature 
roses to chives to cucumbers to raspberries 
his potting mix formula is based on an ancient wheelbarrow with 
1 cubic foot capacity he starts with 4 inches of horse manure from 
a nearby riding stable and mixes this with a gallon container of 
perlite a gallon of vermiculite a cup of bonemeal two cups of 
gypsum and a gallon of any commercially sold potting mix 
the front yard is mostly flower beds and shrubs but it does 
include 100 square feet of lawn grass thats plenty of lawn to 
take care of he says 
 
editors note james walters worked for the ap as a reporter 
and editor from 1947 until he retired in 1984

with members of congress finally working hard to 
achieve budget cuts some of the very people who had urged them to 
do so are having second thoughts 
the very idea of cuts is so politically sensitive and 
economically involved that some of these people speak only in 
whispers but what those whispers convey is that now might not be 
the best time to cut anything but taxes 
events of the past several weeks have conspired to bring about 
this newer attitude events such as higher oil prices additional 
evidence of a decaying economy a squeeze on household budgets and 
a business credit crunch 
the weakening economy now worries some of these people more than 
continued budget overruns in spite of their having made the latter 
the biggest economic issue of the past year 
the latest job figures have added to the concern new job 
creation has fallen abruptly unemployment is up and monthly job 
gains in private industry so far this year hav been off nearly 50 
percent from the like period of 1989 
other reports show that the only parts of the economy still 
growing vibrantly are health care and state and local governments 
and each of these presents problems of its own inflation in health 
care and bureaucratic growth in government neither of them 
designed for a healthy economy 
but ask the whisperers is now the time to make cuts in 
government spending or even to hold it down if the private sector 
economy is withering what except government spending is available 
to give it a nudge 
besides it is said no matter what congress or the white house 
or anyone else wants spending isnt likely to come down when 
billions of dollars are being spent on the military action in the 
mideast 
in a announcement called straighttalk conference board 
economist gail fosler states that military and economic 
uncertainties combined with high tax burdens will prevent any 
meaningful action in slashing the deficit 
fosler comments that federal borrowing will surge over the 
next two years regardless of what the administration and congress 
do to bring down the deficit 
those who say congress shouldnt even try to make the effort 
arent declaring their positions nearly as boldly to do so would 
brand some of them as turncoats because all year long they have 
been advocating cuts 
but says one analyst of the economic scene as the 
grammrudman deadline of oct 1 draws near the weakening economy 
threatens to make these budget negotiations an academic 
excercise 
that comment comes from john wright of wright investors 
service who adds that clearly in its current fragile state the 
us economy can scarcely tolerate either higher taxes or 
acrosstheboard spending cuts 
but it can hardly afford higher interest rates either and until 
congress reaches some sort of agreement those rates are likely to 
remain high that much has been indicated by alan greenspan 
chairman of the federal reserve board 
not only does he remain committed to smaller budget deficits 
but he seems equally determined to forestall any drop in interest 
rates until congress reaches an agreement

hundreds of longtime customers of dayton 
hudson corp are tearing up their credit cards and threatening a 
christmas season boycott in a revolt over the retailers snub of 
planned parenthood 
the credit card shreds began arriving by mail at daytons 
downtown headquarters after the company confirmed on labor day 
weekend that it was ending 22 years of financial support for 
educational programs at planned parenthood of minnesota the 
response prompted trustees of the dayton hudson foundation to 
reconsider their decision in talks with planned parenthood set to 
continue this week 
i dont think they expected any big outcry said toni 
tschann of the minnesota womens political caucus and frankly i 
never thought id hear from this many but people arent standing 
for it 
dayton hudson spokeswoman ann barkelew said several hundred 
customers have returned their credit cards on saturday about 500 
people rallied outside a daytons store in suburban edina where 
they repeated their vow to boycott all dayton hudson stores 
beginning the day after thanksgiving unless funding is restored 
dayton hudson with 1989 sales of 136 billion owns daytons 
target marshall fields hudsons and mervyns department stores 
in 33 states 
daytons has always stood with women said gloria griffin of 
the minnesota womens consortium women are their customers i 
strongly feel this is only a momentary mistake 
weighing in behind the irate shoppers is at least one big 
investor and bryn mawr college president mary patterson mcpherson 
who sits on the dayton hudson board of directors but is not a 
trustee of the foundation 
i am pleased they are reconsidering said mcpherson who 
declined to elaborate she is an adviser at womens way a 
philadelphia group that funds organizations that work in concert 
with planned parenthood 
the majority just feel that helping lowincome teenagers is 
something that nobody should be afraid to do especially 
daytons tschann said 
in 1946 dayton hudson began giving 5 percent of profits to 
charities in 1989 the company gave away 22 million and received 
the americas corporate conscience award from the council on 
economic priorities 
when a company of the prestige and importance in the 
philanthropic community says no to planned parenthood of 
minnesota that is a devastating message to corporate america 
thomas webber executive director of planned parenthood of 
minnesota said webber said the proposed 20000 grant is 
financially insignificant compared to its symbolic importance 
many shoppers believe daytons withdrew financial support from 
planned parenthood because the christian action council of falls 
church va threatened to boycot daytons and other corporations 
that fund planned parenthood 
barkelew said foundation trustees for years had considered 
ending financial support to planned parenthood because many people 
misconstrue the aid as support for abortion 
but barkelew said the company was having increasing difficulty 
convincing people that the money was not used to fund abortions 
she said the foundation will continue to support other groups with 
teen pregnancy prevention programs 
instead of freeing dayton hudson from the abortion debate the 
decision has had the opposite effect the possibility of a boycott 
from either side looms ust as the company enters the holiday 
shopping season which generates more than 50 percent of annual 
sales 
our worst fears have been realized said new york city 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman a trustee of city pension funds 
holding 319 million of dayton hudson stock were longterm 
investors and its quite clear that when people get angry with a 
company that can affect the bottom line 
holtzman and carol ocleireacain the citys finance 
commissioner urged dayton hudson chairman and chief executive 
officer kenneth macke to continue funding for planned parenthood 
denying the funding places dayton hudson squarely in the camp of 
the antichoice forces and in opposition to the overwhelming 
majority of americans who support accessible birth control the 
investors said in an aug 7 letter 
reatha clark king a spokeswoman for the general mills 
foundation said corporate gift giving decisions should be made 
soley on the merits of published guidelines describing the goals of 
a foundation 
if you start evaluating your requests against special 
interests then you might sway from your purpose said king 
whose organization gave 18000 to planned parenthood this year 
barkelew said the company is confident a solution will be 
reached but she declined to say what steps are being considered

new gaps are opening between congressional and 
administration bargainers at their budget negotiations as democrats 
back away from about 35 billion in proposed cuts to benefits 
programs such as medicare 
the two sides planned a tenth day of meetings today at andrews 
air force base in maryland after a sunday evening session ended on 
a fractious note 
some of our members are wondering if they want an agreement 
said a republican official familiar with the talks it doesnt 
look good right now 
for the last several days democrats have expressed a 
willingness to pare benefit programs by 125 billion from the 
amount needed over the next five years to keep pace with inflation 
differences over spending cuts have been considered one of the 
bargainers minor squabbles 
but sunday democrats told gop bargainers that they could accept 
a lesser cut of about 90 billion in medicare agriculture and 
other benefit programs said two officials who demanded anonymity 
among the proposed reductions they rejected was a republican 
plan to save 27 billion over the next five years by boosting the 
monthly premium medicare participants pay for doctors coverage 
under the gop proposal people with higher incomes would pay more 
than the current 2860 monthly fee 
reductions in benefit programs would be a crucial part of a deal 
bargainers are trying to shape to shrink the federal deficit by 50 
billion next year and 500 billion through 1995 these programs are 
among the fastest growing parts of the federal budget and are one 
of the prime targets on the gop hitlist for savings 
major problems remain over taxes 
democrats and republicans agree that the package should include 
about 25 billion in new levies and fees for next year 
republicans saying they want to spur the weakening economy 
insist that a cut in the capital gains tax rate be part of that 
package they say cutting the tax paid on profitable sales of 
property would encourage more people to sell their holdings and 
would increase government revenues 
but democrats say the proposal would simply help the wealthy 
lower their tax burden and they want some other tax boost for the 
rich as a tradeoff 
the two sides tried working out a deal on taxes sunday but got 
nowhere 
administration budget director richard darman proposed several 
alternatives he said republicans would accept in exchange for 
dropping the capital gains tax rate said one official among them 
was a plan eliminating certain deductions for people with adjusted 
gross annual incomes above 200000 
there was no meeting of the minds at all the official said 
both sides agree taxes should be increased on alcoholic 
beverages luxury items such as fancy cars and electronics 
equipment energy and perhaps on cigarettes final details have yet 
to be worked out

a us company that lost the bidding to build a 
peoplemover system for a new japanese airport said monday there 
were irregularities in the decision that awarded the contract to 
japanese bidders 
the dispute involves the 7 billion kansai international airport 
being built in osaka in western japan the airport project earlier 
had been at the center of american complaints that us firms did 
not have fair access to the japanese construction market 
kansai international airport co conducted a briefing monday for 
the 13 bidders on why it chose niigata engineering co and sumitomo 
corp to build the system to carry passengers to remote gates at 
the airport scheduled to open in 1993 
with the information provided to us in the meeting today it 
is clear that there were irregularities in the procurement process 
of the peoplemover contract for kia said john tucker president 
of aeg westinghouse transportation systems headquartered in 
pittsburgh 
in a statement tucker added that this latest information 
provided only fuels the fire of our efforts to block the award of 
the project to niigata engineering and to pursue any avenues to 
make the truth known 
efforts to reach westinghouse officials here for elaboration on 
the alleged irregularities or what the company specifically planned 
to do to block the contract award were unsuccessful 
the briefing was called after westinghouse charged that there 
were violations of the usjapan construction agreement in the 
evaluation and selection procedures 
the airport company announced in july that the contract for an 
automated guideway transport system in the passenger terminal 
building had been awarded to niigata engineering and sumitomo it 
did not state the value of the contract 
company officials said monday they had explained at the briefing 
that the procedure had been fair they added that while 
westinghouse had experience in such systems niigata engineering 
also was experienced in city transportation systems 
japan and the united states reached an agreement in 1988 on 
procedures to allow american builders to bid on construction 
projects in japan including the kansai airport us officials 
said later japan was making significant progress in allowing 
american companies to compete for construction projects

next target said trader ed kevelson with dean witter reynolds 
inc 3235 which seemed like a pretty tough level to get to 
just evaporates this morning 
kevelson said traders were also reacting to news that iran and 
iraq had stopped exchanging prisoners despite their recent 
conciliatory moves that have included the reestablishment of 
diplomatic ties traders were also following reports that proiraqi 
groups might try to move food and medicine into iraq despite the 
blockade of iraq that was imposed after its troops occupied kuwait 
i think any test of the blockade is very bullish at the 
moment kevelson said 
the price of crude opened so high on the merc in response to 
prices of brent which was trading up about 130 per barrel today 
said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
brent prices were higher in part because of a north sea pipeline 
problem that was keeping about 70000 barrels per day off the 
market european oil prices were also higher because of a rumor 
that unscheduled repairs would be held on a soviet pipeline from 
the ural mountains to the caspian sea although traders said the 
soviets issued a statement this morning that was construed as a 
denial of the rumor 
that kind of took a little bit of wind out of the market 
hittle said 
when brent is trading at a premium supplies that normally would 
go to the united states are often kept in europe which can help 
push up prices of the light sweet crude futures traded on the merc 
hittle said 
rising oil prices were accompanied by higher prices for 
petroleum products futures 
unleaded gasoline was up 294 cents to 9330 cents per gallon on 
october contracts while home heating oil was up 291 cents to 
8570 per gallon on october contracts in late morning trading 
distant months were all higher for the products 
natural gas stayed the same at 152 per 1000 cubic feet for 
october delivery although later months were slightly higher

a national energy policy promoting the 
use of coal could have helped prevent the persian gulf crisis the 
united mine workers president said today at the convention marking 
the unions 100th anniversary 
the only reason characters like saddam hussein have any power 
at all is because of the oil they have oil we could have replaced 
years ago with coal mined in the united states and canada umw 
president richard trumka said 
aflcio president lane kirkland told the more than 1000 
delegates from the united states and canada that unions are on the 
verge of a breakthrough following the 1980s which he called a 
period of illusion excess and frustration 
kirkland urged support of a bill before congress that would bar 
employers from permanently replacing striking workers 
thats a basic right recognized in all but the most backward 
or repressive nations he said 
the umw rejoined the aflcio last year four decades after the 
famed umw president john l lewis pulled his union out 
other speakers scheduled to address the delegates include the 
rev jesse jackson and labor secretary elizabeth dole 
the celebration of the oncepowerful unions centennial is mixed 
with financial and legal concerns 
during the nineday meeting delegates will be asked to give the 
international executive board the umws governing body authority 
to close or merge the 21 local districts to help the union save 
money several of the largely autonomous districts are insolvent 
because of layoffs 
they also will decide whether to allow the governing body use of 
interest earnings from the 60 million strike fund to pay legal 
expenses and other costs associated with strikes currently the 
fund can be used only to pay benefits to strikers 
and the delegates will be asked to approve changes umw leaders 
say they need to deal with multinational corporations in the world 
coal market 
trumka and other union officials say the proposals will give the 
union the latitude to deal with coal companies that increasingly 
are owned by conglomerates such as exxon and du pont 
the convention at the opulent fontainebleau hotel comes as the 
umw struggles to overturn 52 million in fines levied by a virginia 
judge because of the 10month pittston strike in 1989 the union 
also faces more than 1 billion in lawsuits filed by companies 
idled by a fiveweek wildcat strike that began in sympathy with the 
pittston strikers 
the union declared victory in the bitter pittston strike but it 
was a costly win a financial disclosure form shows the unions net 
worth fell by 45 million in 1989 down to 126 million 
the umw formed in 1890 by the merger of two rival mine unions 
once held a firm grip on the nations energy needs as late as the 
1940s its 400000 members controlled 80 percent of the countrys 
coal production 
but the unions influence has declined in recent years beset by 
increased mechanization in the nations mines and a jump in the 
number of nonunion coal operations the umw has seen its working 
membership dip to about 70000

general motors corp and the united auto workers 
reached tentative agreement early today on a new threeyear 
contract covering 300000 workers in 29 states 
im just delighted we got this contract settled without a 
disruption uaw president owen bieber said in announcing the 
agreement reached after a 41hour bargaining session between the 
union and the worlds no 1 automaker 
details of the agreement were to be outlined at a meeting this 
morning in suburban detroit of the unions 300member gm bargaining 
council made up of local union presidents and bargaining committee 
chairmen but that meeting broke up after only 15 minutes and was 
rescheduled for tuesday because the printing of the proposed 
contract had not been completed 
bieber said at a news conference before dawn that he was very 
very satisfied with the agreement on pensions and gm vice 
president alfred warren said the contract gives the company 
latitude to reduce its work force 
the detroit news reported today that the contract includes a 3 
percent raise the first year 3 percent lump sum payments the next 
two and retention of a requirement that gm hire one worker for 
every two who quit retire or die 
there had been speculation that gm would push hard to remove or 
alter the 1for2 policy and that the automaker wants to cut tens 
of thousands of hourly jobs and close up to four assembly plants to 
better compete with the japanese 
the big three automakers lost about 6 percentage points in us 
market share during the 1980s while the japanese gained the same 
amount 
if approved by the uaw council the contract would be sent to 
the rank and file for ratification a process expected to be 
completed by the end of the month 
as he arrived for this mornings meeting tom robinson 
president of local 549 in mansfield ohio who helped negotiate the 
settlement said only that it met all the goals we came down here 
to meet 
earl perry of local 2188 in fitzgerald ga was more cautious 
we still have to get through this one he said referring to 
the sincerescheduled bargaining council meeting 
the uaws old threeyear contract with gm expired at midnight 
friday but both sides agreed to extend its terms while talks 
continued 
uaw contracts with ford motor co and chrysler corp also ran 
out at the same time but the union put talks with ford and 
chrysler on hold so that it could concentrate on gm and use that 
pact as a model for the other automakers 
bieber and warren said the new agreement could be tailored to 
ford and chrysler 
the unions contracts with the big three automakers cover more 
than 450000 active workers this year was the first time in 11 
years that uaw contracts with each of the big three ran out at the 
same time 
the last time the uaw struck gm was in 1984 that strike lasted 
a week and ultimately involved about 25 gm facilities nationwide 
meanwhile talks continued in toronto between the canadian auto 
workers union and ford of canada the caws 12800 members at ford 
of canada struck early saturday after talks broke off 
negotiations were held later saturday and resumed sunday no 
plants involved operate on weekends so any strike impact wont be 
felt until today if the strike continued us ford plants that 
use parts made in canada would be affected 
bieber whose unions 15million membership dropped by a third 
largely because of the shrinking us auto industry said he 
expected the tentative agreement would get a warm reception by the 
bargaining council suffice it to say at this point they will be 
pleased with what we have to say he said 
warren said the talks were some of the most difficult 
bargaining ever between gm and the union but warren and bieber 
were upbeat about the prospects for changing labor relations 
between the company and union 
we feel that the spirit we developed during the negotiations 
the relationship we built with the new leadership of the united 
automobile workers bodes well for general motors for the customer 
the marketplace and the united automobile workers warren said 
the average hourly wage with cost of living adjustments for gm 
workers is about 1575 under the 1987 agreement fringe benefits 
particularly health care costs boost that to nearly 30 per hour 
the company has said 
at ford the figure is about 31 per hour and chryslers was 
just more than 33 
some of the fringe benefits include pension matters which was a 
hot topic going into the talks there was a strong movement within 
the uaw to include costofliving adjustments keyed to the 
inflation rate

with strong gains in california and new mexico 
the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in the united states 
rose again this week climbing by 21 to 1060 baker hughes inc 
reported monday 
this weeks tally reflected a smaller increase than the 26 rigs 
added a week ago despite gains of 17 rigs in new mexico and 13 in 
california 
ic kerridge a vice president and economist at baker hughes 
which has been making the survey ince 1940 said the middle east 
situation appeared not to be affecting the count much this week 
a week ago industry watchers credited the 26rig jump to rising 
oil prices triggered by the middle east crisis 
the count a year ago was 965 baker hughes said 
in canada the rig count of 117 represented a jump of 20 a year 
ago the canadian tally was 100 
kerridge speculated the new mexico increase was due to drillers 
working coal seam wells in the northwest part of the state the 
wells produce methane gas from coal deposits and a federal subsidy 
for such wells expires at the end of the year he said 
the california increase followed a previous decline and 
reflected an adjustment in the market kerridge said 
among other major oilproducing states colorado added four 
rigs while oklahoma was up two kansas north dakota and 
pennsylvania each declined by three while ohio lost two and 
michigan one louisiana texas and wyoming were unchanged 
the houstonbased oil toolmakers rig count a widely watched 
index of drilling activity represents the number of rigs actively 
exploring for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986

chemical banking corp said monday it 
is closing its bond trading foreign exchange and money market 
operations in geneva because of insufficient profitability 
chemical was one of the most active participants in swiss franc 
bond trading but high local interest rates and the collapse of the 
tokyo stock market in recent months have hurt the banks 
activitites in the swiss market 
at the same time chemical said it was closing chemical 
securities co in tokyo which concentrated on marketing and 
brokering japanese equities and equitylinked bonds under the 
direction of the geneva office 
the moves were part of the american banking groups strategy to 
focus only on activities where maximum profitability can be 
achieved said francois larsen director of the geneva unit 
called chemical ny capital market corp 
he said the capital markets unit found it increasingly difficult 
to market its service after selling its geneva private banking 
subsidiary in november 1988 to the french financial firm 
dumenilleble sa 
chemical also is closing its foreign exchange and money market 
operation in geneva leaving a sevenperson cash management branch 
office of the new yorkbased bank in zurich as its only swiss 
presence 
patrick voegeli the banks head trader said two factors hurt 
profitability in the past year high shortterm swiss interest 
rates made it expensive to finance bond positions and sharp drops 
on the tokyo stock exchange made swiss investors reluctant to trade 
japanese equitylinked instruments 
chemical bank joined citicorp in founding the swiss newissues 
market in the mid1980s trading on the market comes before the end 
of public subscription and levels quoted there allow investors to 
judge the price they are offered by potential salesmen 
but switzerlands three big banks increasingly dominated the 
market since they began trading there in 1988

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca blames 
himself for the no 3 us automakers deterioration in recent 
years particularly a botched effort to diversify and a failure to 
create more popular cars 
im confessing my sins here iacocca was quoted as telling 
the wall street journal in an interview published monday 
iacocca who turns 66 next month is famous for salvaging 
chrysler from nearbankruptcy at the end of the 1970s in what 
became a nowlegendary comeback 
but under iacocca chrysler has weakened again hurt by vigorous 
competition particularly from imports 
chryslers sales have dropped nearly 17 percent this year vs an 
industrywide decline of 5 percent 
by some estimates chrysler will conclude 1990 as the fifth 
biggest seller of cars in the united states behind japans honda 
motor co and toyota motor corp as well as its historical us 
rivals general motors corp and ford motor co 
during a twohour interview in his highland park mich 
headquarters iacocca said he was determined to lead chrysler 
through a second comeback 
his major failing he was quoted as saying was trying to 
diversify chrysler by expanding into the aerospace and defense 
businesses a strategy that gm and ford also undertook 
he said chryslers effort led to the formation of a holding 
company that added a layer of bureaucracy and diverted the company 
from its main business of producing new vehicles 
chrysler is now shedding its nonauto businesses in an attempt 
to refocus on cars but its current models are still largely 
derived from the 10yearold kcar 
if i made a mistake it was following other companies and 
maybe those were grandiose schemes iacocca said we didnt need 
a holding company thats what made us topheavy 
to shore up its finances chrysler has undertaken a largescale 
cost reduction program including the closing of one third of its 
assembly plants in the past three years iacocca has ordered 25 
billion in reductions to be made by the middle of next year

greed motivated 10 chicago board of trade soybean 
traders to cheat their customers a federal prosecutor said monday 
at the third fraud and racketeering trial stemming from an fbi 
probe 
the conduct of these traders is regulated to ensure that their 
customers from around the world are treated honestly assistant 
us attorney tom durkin said in opening arguments before you is 
a group of people who decided to play by their own rules 
the trial follows the indictment of a clerk and 18 soybean 
traders after a 1988 fbi investigation that also covered the 
chicago mercantile exchange the clerk and other eight traders have 
pleaded guilty 
at least five defendants who have admitted guilt are scheduled 
to testify in the trial along with an undercover agent who taped 
conversations in the trading pit while posing as a trader durkin 
said in court 
they were confident they wouldnt get caught durkin told 
the jury before us district judge george marovich they broke 
the rules to make money that they are not honestly entitled to 
prosecutors used large placards to explain to the jury where the 
alleged crimes occurred visual aids also were used to describe how 
soybean futures are traded 
the soybean traders are among 48 people indicted last fall at 
the worlds two largest futures exchanges twenty avoided trial by 
pleading guilty and one by pleading no contest 
fourteen japanese yen traders from the chicago mercantile 
exchange are being tried before us district judge william t 
hart that trial opened last week 
in the first trial resulting from the investigation a jury in 
july convicted two swiss franc traders from the merc of relatively 
minor trading violations and acquitted a third 
the jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious 
charges including a racketeering count against one of the three 
defendants the men are to be tried again on those charges next 
year

about 25000 shipping industry workers 
went on strike monday in the black sea port of constanta bringing 
most of romanias sea shipping to a halt 
the strike included ship workers navigators dock workers and 
drivers employed by area transport services 
strikers claim a government program announced in june promising 
higher wages better working conditions and speedy decentralization 
of industry was being impeded by government bureaucrats and local 
officials 
adrian tanase an attorney and union leader of the port workers 
said the strike would continue indefinitely he said the 
navigators union sent a telegram monday telling all romanian ships 
worldwide to stop loading or unloading cargo 
the transport ministry said the walkout was unjustified because 
most of the demands have been discussed with the government and are 
being studied by authorities 
the ministry said that among the original demands made by the 
unions in talks with government last week were relaxed import 
rights for seamen to bring in cars video equipment and other 
luxury goods tax free into romania 
president ion iliescu met with several union leaders monday 
the main unions involved in the strike demanded the dismissal 
and punishment of administrators who have not been able to carry 
out the governments promises to workers 
port workers demanded that the port be turned over to private 
hands that safety standards be adhered to and that customs laws be 
changed to make it easier to import goods 
the unions also demanded a share of an estimated 215 million 
worth of property formerly belonging to the prerevolutionary trade 
union confederation in romania which was reorganized shortly after 
the revolution 
the striking unions which have sprung up since and are not 
represented in the national council are demanding 50 million 
worth of the property 
the navigators union also ordered strikes in other port towns 
of galati braila tulcea and sulina tanase said

on monday but the market anticipated an eventual agreement 
the dollar like all other currencies is supported by higher 
interest rates when traders sense that rates are likely to fall in 
the united states they sell dollars 
the us currency has fallen sharply in recent few months amid 
continuing signs of economic weakness the persian gulf crisis has 
also taken a heavy toll on the dollar 
holzer said the dollar also fell on expectations of a widening 
in the us trade deficit the commerce department was releasing 
the july trade figures tuesday while the labor department was 
announcing consumer price figures for august 
the dollar did manage a slight gain against the japanese yen 
rising to 13655 yen in new york from late fridays 13645 in 
tokyo earlier the dollar rose to a closing 13700 japanese yen 
from 13655 yen at fridays close later in london it was quoted 
at 13647 yen

389 from 385 late friday earlier in hong kong gold rose 141 
to close at a bid of 38737 
although prices rose gold dealers in zurich said the markets 
mood remained depressed particularly because gold appears unable 
to move higher despite higher oil prices a weaker dollar and 
little excitement on major equities markets

begin in the middle east is keeping the metal from dropping 
sharply traders said 
silver rose in new york gaining 16 cents to close at 4766 a 
troy ounce on the commodity exchange but earlier in london silver 
fell to a late bid of 478 a troy ounce from 479 late friday

gold futures prices rose strongly monday on new yorks commodity 
exchange as fears of tightening oil supplies pushed crude oil 
futures to record highs spurring some investors to buy gold as an 
inflation hedge 
but precious metal analysts said golds gains were relatively 
small compared with the advance in energy prices suggesting the 
historical relationship between the two markets has changed 
on other commodity markets livestock and meat futures rose 
sharply soybeans fell and grain futures advanced 
gold futures settled 420 to 430 higher in new york with the 
spot september contract at 38940 a troy ounce and the more 
actively traded contract for delivery in october at 39060 a troy 
ounce 
silver futures ended 16 cents to 19 cents higher with 
september at 4766 a troy ounce 
the rally extended to five days a runup in gold prices following 
a 1090 plunge in the september contract on sept 10 the contract 
now has regained all but 10 cents of that amount 
john jonat a precious metals trader with deak international 
inc said traders are focuing more on a perception that higher oil 
prices and the military buildup in saudi arabia will send the us 
economy into a recession than the inflationary implications of 
higher oil prices 
i dont think the old relationships are really in effect 
any more i dont see huge investment demand for gold right now 
coming to the rescue i dont think people are rushing in to buy it 
again 
in the absence of significant developments in the persian gulf 
standoff talk of a possible shortfall in soviet crude exports 
supported crude oil futures on the new york mercantile exchange 
crude also was supported by president bushs statement that he 
saw no need to draw supplies from americas strategic oil reserves 
said jim ritterbusch an energy analyst with painewebber inc 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 32 cents to 187 higher 
with the october contract at 3363 a barrel eclipsing the 
previous closing high of 3235 on aug 2 1983 cash crude prices 
reached nearly 40 a barrel in 1980 
wholesale heating oil futures settled 90 cent to 267 cents 
higher with october at 8531 cents a gallon wholesale unleaded 
gasoline was 131 cents to 194 cents higher with october at 9167 
cents a pound 
livestock and meat futures rose sharply on the chicago 
mercantile exchange led by limit gains of 2 cents a pound in the 
pork belly market amid reports of higher cash hog prices and strong 
demand for pork products 
trading volume in the cattle pits is expected to drop during the 
next two days ahead of a monthly agriculture department on 
wednesday the report is expected to show about a 4 percent 
increase over a year ago in the number of cattle on feedlots in the 
seven largest producing states

7937 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 80 cent higher 
with september at 8917 cents a pound live hogs were 33 cent to 
113 cents higher with october at 53 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with february at 5665 
cents a pound 
soybean futures prices fell on the chicago board of trade in a 
move that some analysts attributed to weather forecasts and slow 
export demand and others to a technical correction after last 
weeks gains 
corn and wheat futures rose moderately reversing the trend of 
the three previous sessions 
after the close a weekly usda report showed 5 percent of the 
us corn crop and 1 percent of the soybean crop harvested as of 
sunday which is slightly behind the normal pace 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 4 cents higher with september 
at 261 a bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with

heightened uncertainty in the mideast propelled 
oil futures prices up almost 2 a barrel monday to nearly 34 
shattering the previous record and leaving traders wondering where 
the market was headed next 
obviously youve got a lot of tension building up again 
said trader ed kevelson with dean witter reynolds inc 
speculators in the influential oilfutures market said they 
believed tensions were higher because of antiamerican 
demonstrations in baghdad and concerns that proiraqi terrorists 
might try to sneak through kuwait into saudi arabia where the 
united states and allies have amassed a large military force 
light sweet crude the benchmark grade of oil on the new york 
mercantile exchange hit an alltime high of 3375 a barrel for 
octoberdelivery contracts before settling at 3363 a barrel 
187 higher than fridays close the monday price broke the 
previous record of 3235 set aug 2 1983 which was matched one 
time during the current oil crisis on aug 23 
other contract months were all higher 
oils rise to the futures record was greeted calmly by traders 
who have grown accustomed to wild price swings since iraq invaded 
kuwait last month provoking world anxiety over the availability of 
oil 
with october crude futures closing above 30 per barrel every 
day last week some had been predicting that the old record was 
about to fall 
i think the mood was there goes that so lets shoot for the 
next target kevelson said if this lasts longer and longer 
40 is certainly not out of the question 
william byers an analyst with bear stearns amp co said oils 
surge above 33 could spur confusion among investors who may have 
to resort to trading on headlines 
were in uncharted territory byers said you have no 
context to look at the market in 
the cash price of oil traded at about 40 per barrel on 
international markets during 1979 the last world oil jolt but the 
mercantile exchanges records for crude date only to march 30 
1983 when the exchange first began offering oil futures contracts 
cash prices represent money paid for actual oil while the 
futures prices represent a bet by traders on what oil will do based 
on future supply and demand 
soaring oil prices had a restraining effect on other financial 
markets monday putting a damper on stock prices and declines in 
bond prices the dollar also continued its recent slide 
oils strength helped bring up the futures prices of petroleum 
products although they lagged crude 
home heating oil rose 252 cents to 8531 cents per gallon on 
october contracts unleaded gasoline rose 131 cents to 9167 cents 
per gallon on october contracts 
other delivery months were higher for both products 
heating oil was a little stronger i think based on seasonal 
considerations byers said 
natural gas went up to 1537 per 1000 cubic feet on october 
contracts compared with fridays close of 1520 near months were 
higher while later months were lower or the same 
analysts attributed some of crude oils strength to higher 
prices for brent blend a european oil that has been pushed up by a 
cutback of 70000 barrels per day at a north sea pipeline 
the high price in europe and strong opening in new york was also 
attributed to rumors of an unscheduled repair at a soviet pipeline 
but the rumors were denied by the kremlin

pandick inc a printer of prospectuses proxy 
materials and other financial documents filed for bankruptcy court 
reorganization on monday becoming another casualty of a business 
slowdown on wall street 
pandick president james alexis attributed the chapter 11 
bankruptcy filing to the steady deterioration of the financial 
markets since the october 1987 stock market crash 
alexis said in a statement that pandicks business has dropped 
more than 50 percent over the past two years during that time the 
mergers and acquisition business has slowed dramatically and wall 
street firms have cut back sharply 
the turmoil in the financial markets since iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait further curtailed the companys business and 
worsened its problems alexis said 
pandick said it dismissed 725 of its 750 employees on friday it 
filed for protection from its creditors in us bankruptcy court in 
new york 
asked whether the company would try to resume its business at 
some point pandick spokesman fred spar said its really 
impossible to speculate what will happen at this point 
pandick joined the ranks of other big financial printers that 
have foundered in recent years including charles p young co and 
sorg inc 
alexis said the company was unable to stay afloat although we 
took significant steps over the past two years to adjust to our 
changing environment including the sale of noncore businesses 
workforce reductions at all levels of the company and an infusion 
of additional equity from our ownership group

the walt disney co is dissolving its 
department that makes onehour television dramas concluding that 
even popular shows will lose money at current production costs of 
12 million per episode 
disney which only recently became a significant producer of tv 
programming will continue to make halfhour comedies which can be 
sold as reruns more easily 
the studio has spent heavily on writers of such comedies giving 
several contracts of more than 1 million a year 
but executives for dramatic development are being reassigned 
although disney will continue to produce onehour hull high and 
the magical world of disney segments for nbc one or two other 
projects from the department also may survive disney executives 
said 
word of the decision leaked out after disney officials began 
informing agents on friday disney executives speaking on 
condition of anonymity confirmed the move monday 
almost every television program is made at a deficit as 
networks are unwilling to pay the full production price the 
studios or independent producers absorb the deficit hoping to 
recoup their losses through television reruns foreign sales and 
occasional videocassettes 
the market for onehour shows both on the networks and in 
syndication has slowed in recent years owing to the growing 
popularity of the situation comedy a few onehour programs 
hunter for example are moneymakers 
disneys projections for the shows are so gloomy that the studio 
is giving up on them despite the prestige and leverage with the 
networks they can bring 
the studios have been complaining about this for a long 
time one disney executive said certainly the unions and the 
guilds didnt believe it well disney is now saying believe it 
 
a turning point was a show titled nypd mounted which 
cbs had ordered after looking at projected revenue figures disney 
decided against producing the program which is being taken over by 
orion pictures corp 
the decision to abandon hourlong tv shows was a difficult one 
for disney chief michael eisner whose background is in television 
disney spent heavily over the past two years to establish itself as 
a force in network programming for the first time 
but a review of predicted revenues turned up bad news for 
onehour dramas which cost 12 million or more per episode 
because they are produced on film with several cameras and 
location settings 
networks generally pay only 800000 to 900000 for the rights 
to broadcast each episode and often less tv stations have found 
that viewers prefer comedy reruns during the key 4 pm8 pm time 
slots so foreign sales must make up the difference and even for a 
successful show those bring in only 250 million to 300 million 
disney just simply couldnt make financial sense of it the 
executive said the numbers even in the halfhour area arent 
great but an hour show even if its a hit for five years we 
cant make a profit 
disney made six onehour pilots last year of which two 
initially were picked up by the networks hull high a high 
school musical and tag team about pro wrestlersturnedcops 
which abc ordered and then dropped three months later 
disney has encountered similar difficulty with its local 
television station kcaltv broadcasting a threehour block of 
primetime news kcal has attracted sparse viewership and negative 
reviews

a spokesman for 12 major european countries 
warned congress on monday that passing a bill to limit us imports 
could threaten world talks aimed at increasing trade and cutting 
subsidies to farmers 
a house vote was scheduled for tuesday the bill would limit the 
increase of imports of shoes clothes and other textiles to 1 
percent a year 
supporters said it would halt a loss of jobs and business in 
this country opponents maintained it would show the united states 
to be unwilling to join a freer world trade system 
andreas van agt ambassador of the european comunity said 
passage of the legislation would be tantamount to eliminating all 
prospects of progress in this area and even worse will jeopardize 
negotiations not just in textiles but in all other areas 
over 100 countries are taking part in trade negotiations that 
began in 1986 in uruguay the united states and the europeans are 
considered the most important negotiators though a deal will not 
be possible without japan and third world countries 
a yearend deadline has been set for agreement though congress 
has given the bush administration power to negotiate until march 
1991 
negotiators for the first time since world trade talks began 
after world war ii are dealing with farm subsidies services such 
as banking and air travel and intellectual property such as 
books patents and computer programs 
these industries now provide many more jobs in the united states 
and other industrial countries than the production of traded goods 
addressed in previous trade talks 
the hope is to increase the current 4 trillion worth of 
international trade every year and to reduce the 250 billion that 
subsidies to farmers are estimated to cost taxpayers and consumers 
annually 
president bush has promised to veto the bill as president 
reagan vetoed two like it but the senate has enough votes to 
overturn a veto though some senators could change sides after a 
veto vote is issued 
passage of this bill would disrupt negotiations on rules 
necessary to protect all us industries from unfair trade 
practices michael j boskin chairman of bushs council of 
economic advisers wrote in a letter to congress 
secretary of state james a baker iii added in a letter of his 
own that the bill would violate agreements of the united states 
with countries supporting it in the gulf crisis

a federal judge barred voit sports inc from 
selling its grass hopper golf bag saying it is too similar to the 
eclipse bag sold by sun mountain sports inc 
the great similarity between these two bags as well as 
voits own advertisement strongly suggests the possibility 
of deliberate copying of plaintiffs product us district judge 
bruce thompson said the injunction issued late friday 
aside from blocking voit from making or distributing the grass 
hopper bag the judge ordered the company to deliver all unsold 
bags for destruction 
executives with new yorkbased voit would not comment on the 
ruling when contacted monday 
sun mountain sports based in missoula mont began marketing 
its eclipse golf bag in july 1986 the bag is characterized by its 
tilted stance and inside dividers designed to keep golf clubs 
separate and easily accessible 
weve made golf bags for a long time and our company really 
began to take off with the introduction of our eclipse bag said 
eric reimers founder and president of sun mountain sports said

eastman kodak co unveiled a product that 
allows snapshots to be stored on compact discs and played back on 
televisions 
the kodak photo cd system digitally stores images from negatives 
or slides on compact discs the pictures can then be shown on 
ordinary television or computer screens with a photo cd player that 
also plays audio cds 
this is the answer for consumers who have wanted both the 
astonishing quality of 35 millimeter photography and the 
convenience of digital storage display and manipulation users can 
enjoy traditional photographic quality and view their pictures on 
tv kodak chairman and chief executive kay whitmore said in a 
statement 
the system will not be available until 1992 kodak said it made 
the announcement to give other manufacturers time to develop 
licensed products and software 
kodak introduced the photo cd at a news conference in tokyo 
tuesday morning the company planned news conferences later in the 
day in london new york and rochester 
to use the system film is first processed conventionally into 
negatives or slides each picture is then scanned and transferred 
into digital form and the compressed digital image is written to a 
compact disc 
photo customers bringing film in to a photofinisher will have 
the option of ordering a photo cd along with their prints and 
negatives or slides kodak said unfilled discs can be returned to 
have more images added creating electronic albums of up to 100 
pictures 
the digital pictures have the same resolution and color quality 
as a film image according to kodak officials because that 
resolution is 16 times greater than a regular television and four 
times greater than high definition television formats the 
technology will not become obsolete for a long time spokesman paul 
allen said 
we believe this will set the standard for many years to 
come allen said 
the cd player allows viewers to manipulate the picture on the 
television screen by zooming in cropping a picture or shuffling 
the order 
the company anticipates the photo cd player will take the place 
of the slide projector for group viewing of photographs allen 
said 
the system was developed jointly with dutch consumer electronics 
company nv philips which owns most cd patents the photo cd 
players will be manufactured by philips and will play either 
photographic or audio cds kodak will manufacture the goldcolored 
photographic cds each capable of holding up to 100 images 
the photo cd player is expected to cost less than 500 and a 
photo cd less than 20 
the photofinishing system consists of a highresolution film 
scanner made by kodak a computer work station and image processing 
software a philipsmade discwriter and kodak thermal printer the 
processing system is expected to cost less than 100000 and will 
be targeted at photofinishers and possibly even minilabs allen 
said 
the discs which will be manufactured in rochester are 
compatible with computer cd1 and cd rom xa readers kodak 
officials said they expect software to be developed that will make 
the system compatible with most computers 
the company expects other uses for the system to emerge in 
desktop publishing and other fields officials said

the scrappy new york post colorful chronicler 
of a troubled city survived its own brush with extinction monday 
after its biggest union agreed to concessions to save the publisher 
money 
members of the newspaper guild representing 350 editorial 
advertising and clerical employees voted 24245 to approve 
concessions including eliminating dozens of jobs and cutting the 
workweek to four days with a 20 percent pay cut a lastminute 
sweetener offered by publisher peter s kalikow would boost 
severence pay for those who agree to resign 
kalikow had said he would close the nations oldest continuously 
published daily and put nearly 1000 people out of work if the 
guild rejected the offer 
lets go to press kalikow said after the vote 
this is not a management victory he added it is not a 
labor victory it is a victory for all new yorkers who deserve the 
honesty and diversity offered in the pages of the new york post 
the guild was the last of the papers 11 unions to reach 
agreement with kalikow on a total package of 27 million in cost 
cuts 
the vote followed a 90minute meeting punctuated by boos 
applause and speeches 
you feel like the executioner has loosened the noose said 
jill brooke who reports on tv and radio issues but we still 
have a life sentence a 20 percent pay cut 
we accepted a package that none of us liked we accepted a 
package that made no sense to any of us and we accepted a package 
that makes us less than middle class said reporter peter moses 
who nonetheless voted for approval we went from the outhouse to 
the tree 
editor jerry nachman said he was overwhelmed by gratitude 
they have taken a great sacrifice in order to preserve their 
careers in new york journalism their colleagues careers and an 
important new york institution nachman said 
union members said sentiment swung in favor of the plan monday 
afternoon when kalikow offered to buy out those who agreed to 
resign the publisher said employees could approve the plan then 
resign by wednesday night and receive the same termination and 
severance pay as if the paper were shut down 
some employees had argued earlier that they might be better off 
voting against the deal and taking the severance and termination 
money that would come with the newspaper folding 
that takes away the principal reason for a no vote 
metropolitan editor john cotter said of the sweetened offer before 
monday nights meeting 
theodore kheel an adviser to the unions also said the post 
would not stick to its requirement that 43 jobs be severed but 
would settle for whatever number of resignations were forthcoming 
at a news conference after the vote guild president barry 
lipton said he didnt know how many would resign 
kalikow also has promised the unions 20 percent of the companys 
stock and a representative on the board of directors 
kalikow said he had to have the union concessions to cut back on 
losses now running at about 27 million on an annual basis he is 
believed to have lost more than 100 million personally on the 
paper 
by friday night negotiators for the posts 10 other unions had 
reached agreement with the company the guilds negotiating 
committee rejected kalikows offer 73 but local president barry 
lipton endorsed it and had it put up to a vote of the members 
the package includes about 19 million in union concessions and 
8 million in other cost reductions including management wage 
cuts 
mondays front page asked will the post presses ever run 
again 
on the street before the vote new yorkers thought about life 
without the citys feistiest tabloid 
i love the post i dont like to see it go said joseph 
yedid but he sympathized with kalikow this is new york you 
always look out for your own interests 
the post was founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton and a group 
of merchants the paper had money troubles from the start but its 
fortunes seemed to have dimmed for good in the 1970s as much of 
its audience moved to the suburbs 
australian media baron rupert murdoch took over in 1976 and 
transformed the post from a liberal into a politically conservative 
tabloid albeit one that featured sexy pictures racy headlines 
like the famous headless body in topless bar and lots of 
crime stories 
murdoch said the paper lost 150 million before he sold it in 
1988 for 37 million to kalikow a real estate developer who also 
acquired the papers valuable waterfront land on south street in 
lower manhattan 
under kalikow the paper has never made money and suffered heavy 
lossess on an illfated sunday edition launched for a brief period 
in 1989 recently the slump has deepened as an economic decline in 
the new york city further cut advertising revenues

charles keating jr former head of lincoln 
savings and loan has been indicted in connection with the sale of 
junk bonds issued by the failed irvinebased thrift according to a 
report broadcast monday 
keating former head of lincoln and its parent company american 
continental corp of phoenix was to be arraigned tuesday morning 
in superior court on charges of criminal fraud kcbstv reported 
citing unidentified sources 
the businessman was indicted in connection with lincolns sale 
of more than 200 million in now virtually worthless junk bonds to 
22000 investors many of whom were elderly according to the 
report 
the indictment would represent the first criminal charges in the 
lincoln case numerous civil lawsuits have been filed 
district attorney ira reiner declined to confirm the report but 
issued a statement saying his office had completed its presentation 
to a special grand jury investigating the matter 
since grand jury proceedings are confidential the district 
attorneys office will not comment until such time the court lifts 
the seal of confidentiality the statement from reiners office 
said 
the grand jury began investigating in february whether lincoln 
officials misled bond buyers into believing the highrisk bonds 
were federally insured the district attorney had been presenting 
evidence since april 
the government seized control of lincoln in april 1989 
regulators estimate the bailout could cost taxpayers as much as 2 
billion federal and state prosecutors also were not in their 
offices 
last month a federal judge in washington upheld the government 
takeover of lincoln saying the operation of the thrift by keating 
and others amounted to looting 
on monday night shirley lampel one of the disaffected 
bondholders responded to the report of the indictment saying i 
dont know how many bondholders are out there but theyre 
dancing in the street tonight 
wed like to get our money back she added 
us district judge stanley sporkin dismissed keatings suit to 
recover the collapsed thrift and said it was abundantly clear 
keating and other officials abused their positions 
keating could not immediately be reached for comment the los 
angelesand chicagobased attorneys representing keating were not 
in their offices after business hours 
under a recent agreement announced by the justice department 
keating must tell the office of thrift supervision 48 hours in 
advance of any transactions exceeding 5000 keating already has 
provided financial statements which have not been disclosed 
those terms had previously been imposed on keating by a 
preliminary injunction issued by the us district court in los 
angeles the announcement indicated he had agreed to them

trans world northwest and united joined other 
major airlines monday in imposing an additional 42 percent fare 
increase that will raise domestic tickets by a total of 972 
percent since iraq invaded kuwait 
the higher rates go into effect on oct 1 as airlines try to 
recoup some of the extra money spent on jet fuel which has risen 
by about 50 percent since the aug 2 invasion 
last month airlines boosted domestic fares by 53 percent to 
partially offset the higher fuel costs 
the latest round of increases bring the industrys major players 
to the same levels of higher fares 
twa spokesman jim faulkner said airlines will not be able to 
recover all of the costs they have absorbed recently as passengers 
have used up old cheaper tickets while flying on planes that used 
the more expensive jet fuel 
airlines were unsure whether they will be catching up with the 
higher costs once the higher rates go into effect 
thats beyond our speculative abilities because it requires 
seeing into the brain of saddam hussein and we dont have that 
capability northwest spokesman bob gibbons said 
the second wave of fare increases was begun by pan am which 
announced a 44 percent increase on top of its earlier increase 
airlines that responded last week with announcements of 
additional 42 percent fare increases included american america 
west usair delta and eastern
