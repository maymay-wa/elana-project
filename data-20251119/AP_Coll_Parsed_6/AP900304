officials tried sunday to arrest a 
governor indicted in a recent coup attempt but his supporters 
defended him in clashes that left at least 14 people dead 
including a general authorities said 
the trouble began early sunday when officials sent to arrest 
gov rodolfo aguinaldo in the city of tuguegarao were taken hostage 
in a hotel later government forces stormed the hotel leading to 
a series of clashes later in the day in the city at least 10 
people were reported wounded 
aguinaldo a former lieutenant colonel escaped but officials 
said sunday about 200 of his followers had surrendered 
the military chief of staff gen renato de villa placed the 
armed forces on nationwide alert and ordered the military to 
capture aguinaldo at all costs 
scattered shooting was still reported late sunday in tuguegarao 
capital of cagayan province 250 miles north of manila 
col emiliano templo told reporters aguinaldos followers were 
believed to be holding some people hostage in homes near the hotel 
however acting gov melvin vargas said 10 more aguinaldo 
followers surrendered early monday and released about 30 hostages 
they were holding at a pawn shop it was unclear if other hostages 
were still being held 
troops blocked a major bridge south of tuguegarao stranding 
thousands of travelers templo said aguinaldos followers included 
his private army government militiamen and army scout rangers 
marines were flown from manila on sunday to reinforce security 
in tuguegarao a city of more than 80000 people philippine 
airlines canceled flights to the city and schools were ordered 
closed monday 
in manila a homemade bomb exploded late sunday in the makati 
district but no injuries were reported and it was apparently 
unrelated to the fighting 
local governments secretary luis santos and brig gen oscar 
florendo had gone to tuguegarao to serve aguinaldo with the arrest 
warrant 
before dawn aguinaldos supporters surrounded the sixstory 
delfino hotel and took florendo chief of the militarys civil 
relations service and three aides prisoner and trapped santos and 
others on the second floor 
about 3 pm government forces launched an attack florendo 
51 was wounded during the rescue and was dead on arrival at a city 
hospital said defense spokeswoman lourdes ilustre 
santos two mayors two colonels and a navy commodore were 
rescued unharmed officials said 
casualty figures were incomplete but regional commander col 
miguel fontanilla said at least 14 people died 
they included 10 killed during a clash at a checkpoint near a 
bridge three in fighting near a gasoline station and florendo at 
the hotel he said 
president corazon aquino said florendo was killed by one of 
the followers of suspended gov rodolfo aguinaldo the act of 
cowardice and treachery of aguinaldos followers will not go 
unpunished 
i call on all our people to continue to reject violence and 
uphold our constitutional democracy and the processes of law in a 
peaceful manner 
in a radio interview at the hotel earlier sunday aguinaldo said 
he was a victim of injustice i dont mind dying as a 
villain he threatened to take his followers into the mountains 
and become a rebel 
aguinaldo was suspended in january as governor of cagayan 
province for allegedly supporting the dec 19 military rebellion 
and had been holed up in his hometown of gattaran 45 miles north 
of tuguegarao 
aquinaldo told a manila radio station on dec 1 that he was 
sending tanks and artillery to the city to support mutineers trying 
to oust mrs aquino 
the governor was indicted along with sen juan ponce enrile and 
five others in connection with the coup attempt the sixth and 
bloodiest attempt to topple mrs aquino since she took power in 
1986 
enrile appeared in court monday to face the charge of 
rebellion with murder in connection with the failed coup but 
the arraignment was put off until the supreme court decides whether 
the charge is valid the court is to hear arguments tuesday 
aguinaldo was also implicated but never charged in a august 1987 
coup attempt later he raised a private army ostensibly to fight 
communist guerrillas he ran for provincial governor in january 
1988 and was elected by a landslide aguinaldo was formerly the 
provincial commander of cagayan and many of the troopers assigned 
there are believed loyal to him

a widely imitated environmental law banning 
plastic food containers and grocery bags was overturned by a state 
appeals court 
the suffolk county law intended to rid dumps of longlasting 
plastics was invalid because the county failed to prepare an 
environmental impact statement the appellate division of the state 
supreme court said in a unanimous ruling friday 
the law was hailed by environmentalists and became the model for 
measures around the country after it was passed in 1988 by the 
county on long island 
it banned restaurants bars grocery stores and other retail 
food establishments from using two plastics polystyrene a 
foamlike material used for cups trays and cartons and polyvinyl 
chloride used for grocery bags 
i am going to lift up my plasticfoam cup and salute the 
judges that struck down a law that would have crippled plastics 
recycling said leonard raskin a member of the consumer 
packaging coalition an industry group that opposed the law 
plastics interests challenged the law because the county hadnt 
filed an environmental impact statement 
suffolk county executive patrick g halpin said the county 
felt the benefits were obvious and therefore didnt require a 
full impact statement 
halpin said the county had yet to decide if it would appeal 
but plastics industry officials said it the law would force the 
use of more paper containers which also are slow to disintegrate 
in landfills 
switching plastics with paper was nonsense raskin said 
researchers are finding 40yearold newspapers in california 
landfills 
the laws chief sponsor legislator stephen c englebright 
noted that a state law to protect drinking water requires that all 
landfills on long island close by the end of the year 
the industry goes in with the specious argument that plastics 
are better for landfills than paper englebright said the 
ruling ignores the fact that we arent going to have landfills

the ukrainian government plans to phase out 
operations at the chernobyl nuclear power plant over the next five 
years according to reports cited by the washington post 
however it is unclear whether the soviet republics government 
has authority over the chernobyl plant site of the worlds worst 
nuclear accident 
the post in its sunday editions said an official government 
publication reported the ukrainian legislature recently passed a 
resolution to close the power station 
in april 1986 at least 31 people were killed and hundreds more 
sickened when radiation was released after an explosion and fire at 
the power plant in the western soviet republic 
soviet authorities have said they would not close chernobyl 
because it would result in an energy shortage in the region and 
other warsaw pact countries in eastern europe 
however nuclear power plants in other areas including armenia 
and the crimea have been closed because of increased pressure from 
environmentalists 
the soviet central government has traditionally had authority 
over facilities such as power plants in local soviet communities 
but recent powersharing between the republics and moscow has 
encouraged speculation that the decision made in kiev the 
ukrainian capital will stand the post said

hunters may be called in to kill some of 
the 20 bison that wandered out of yellowstone national park late 
last week state wildlife officials said saturday 
park bison are thought to carry the disease brucellosis which 
can cause spontaneous abortion in cattle 
the animals were spotted by a game warden thursday night grazing 
outside the parks west boundary said john cada of the state 
department of fish wildlife and parks 
a hunt is likely if the bison get in a position where we can 
take some cada told the associated press we may take a few to 
encourage the others to return to the park 
state law allows the controlled hunting of bison that enter 
montana from the national park 
the policy has aroused the wrath of animalrights groups which 
objected when the state allowed hunters to kill 569 bison last 
winter

a london newspaper reported sunday that a 
delegation of iranian officials has arrived in beirut on a mission 
to free one or more of the western hostages held in lebanon 
the independent on sunday said its information came from 
unidentified lebanese and iranian exiles in london and paris 
one exile who took part in previous hostage negotiations said 
he expected a release within days but others said a final decision 
depended on the outcome of political infighting in tehran the 
paper said 
the report follows a spate of statements from iranian newspapers 
and officials in recent days saying the hostages should be released 
because they are fueling propaganda against iran 
the independent on sunday reported the iranian team sent to 
beirut was dispatched by president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
irans socalled pragmatists led by rafsanjani want to repair 
damaged relations with the west but they are at odds with 
hardline antiwestern radicals led by former interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi 
there are 18 westerners missing in lebanon most are believed 
held by proiranian factions 
the hostages include eight americans four britons two swiss 
two west germans an italian and an irishman the longest held is 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press he was kidnapped march 16 1985

an important witness went into the wind 
apparently skipping town and carrying with him a key part of the 
prosecutions case against six white men charged with murdering a 
black teenager 
john vento admitted participating in the aug 23 racial attack 
on yusuf hawkins and agreed to testify for the prosecution but he 
disappeared in december 
jury selection in the case was to start monday brooklyn 
district attorney charles j hynes said he would seek a onemonth 
adjournment unless the 21yearold highschool dropout surfaces 
on saturday meanwhile about 300 people led by hawkins father 
marched to ventos home in the mainly white bensonhurst 
neighborhood of brooklyn to protest prosectors handling of the 
case 
it seems that this case has never been taken seriously by the 
district attorneys office said the rev al sharpton a march 
organizer 
police on motorcycles and wearing riot gear separated the 
marchers who arrived in six buses about 230 pm from 
bensonhurst residents 
everything was peaceful said officer ralph st just a 
police spokesman he reported no arrests 
former district attorney elizabeth holtzman had struck a deal to 
drop charges against vento if he would testify 
hynes who took office in january maintains the loss of ventos 
testimony would not be devastating but privately prosecutors say 
the case is improved immeasurably with ventos participation 
without him is it hopeless the opinion is divided said 
one source in the prosecutors office who spoke on condition that 
he not be identified 
lawyers for the defendants say even if vento reappears hynes 
has suffered a major setback 
vento is going to be a lowlife with no credibility defense 
lawyer stephen murphy said 
vento was a member of a gang of some 30 young whites many of 
them wielding baseball bats who surrounded the 16yearold 
hawkins and three of his friends on a street in the mainly white 
bensonhurst neighborhood 
the gang had assembled out of a mistaken belief that a group of 
blacks and hispanics were about to enter their enclave to attend a 
neighborhood girls birthday party and create trouble police said 
the whites set upon hawkins and his pals who had come to look at a 
used car for sale 
joseph fama 19 is charged with fatally shooting hawkins in the 
chest five other whites also have been charged in the killing and 
a seventh is charged with assault only fama is being held without 
bail 
hynes said vento went into the wind around christmas 
authorities do not believe he met with foul play instead hynes 
believes vento chickened out when faced with the prospect of 
testifying against his friends 
in announcing ventos disappearance last week prosecutors tried 
to lure him back saying that if he breaks his promise to testify 
they have sufficient evidence to charge him with seconddegree 
murder for his role in the attack 
murphy attorney for alleged bensonhurst ringleader keith 
mondello 20 said the credibility of a major witness who 
prosecutors admit took part in a murder and then fled after cutting 
a generous deal is nil 
the other defense lawyers agree his decision to abscond will 
probably severely undermine his credibility as a witness said 
benjamin brafman the lawyer for defendant james patino 24 
i have to assume that prosecutors believe hes going to be a 
very important witness brafman said normally when a witness 
who could be a defendant gets a complete pass that person is 
deemed extremely important by the prosecution 
stanley meyer lawyer for the accused triggerman described 
vento as an integral part of hynes case he said vento was 
expected to testify that someone put the gun in famas hands 
we dispute that meyer said the thought crosses my mind 
that maybe he doesnt want to testify because he doesnt want to 
commit perjury 
hawkins parents said thursday they felt betrayed by 
prosecutors who they said promised them there would be no deals 
with their sons attackers 
the case has reunited some of the lead characters from another 
case that grabbed the citys attention 2 years ago the howard 
beach case in which a white mob chased a black man onto a highway 
where he was killed by a car 
hynes successfully prosecuted that case and went on to be 
elected brooklyn district attorney last year succeeding holtzman 
who was elected city comptroller 
murphy a scrappy lawyer who speaks in a scream defended the 
only howard beach murder defendant who was acquitted

protesters threw firebombs at the 
peruvian embassy on saturday angered because the embassy is giving 
refuge to two officers who were allied with ousted dictator manuel 
antonio noriega 
there were no injuries or serious damage in the incident us 
soldiers and panamanian police restored order 
the protest was organized by widows of panamanian soldiers slain 
in the oct 3 attempt to topple noriega they are angered that 
gonzalo gonzalez and heraclides sucre who are accused of killing 
coup leader maj moises giroldi have taken refuge in the embassy 
protesters also said they were concerned that the panamanian 
government guaranteed safe passage wednesday to noriegas family 
and several other noriega associates noriegas family left into 
exile friday night 
giroldis widow adela led about 70 protesters including other 
widows and relatives of officers executed after surrendering during 
the insurrection against noriega who headed panamas military 
until he was overthrown by the united states in a dec 20 invasion 
the defense forces under noriega had said 10 officers were 
killed in the coup attempt a human rights official estimated the 
total number dead at 77 
mrs giroldi said she doesnt know who threw the firebombs it 
was peaceful and that the incidents were provoked by unknown 
people she said 
the pressure that we have been applying is sufficient its a 
matter of being firm with the peruvian government she added 
after the embassy incident the protesters met with ricardo 
arias calderon first vice president and minister of justice and 
security arias calderon guaranteed the widows that the government 
would not grant safe conduct to gonzalez and sucre 
i along with the foreign minister julio linares are 
offering our apologies to the government of peru he said it 
was a sad incident it violated international law there were 
troublemakers unknown people

a striking greyhound lines inc bus driver was hit by a coach 
and killed while picketing saturday in the second day of a walkout 
that has nearly shut down service by the only nationwide bus 
company 
the striker in redding calif was crushed against a wall as a 
temporary driver hired for the walkout was trying to maneuver his 
bus around a pickup truck driven by another striker witnesses 
said police questioned the driver but didnt arrest him 
elsewhere there were scattered confrontations between strikers 
and replacement drivers in the walkout that stranded many travelers 
and left hundreds of small communities without public intercity 
transportation 
the amalgamated council of greyhound local unions which 
represents more than 9000 employees including all 6300 drivers 
and most maintenance and office workers went on strike friday 
after negotiators in scottsdale ariz failed to reach agreement 
on pay no talks were scheduled 
greyhound chairman fred g currey said saturday the company was 
operating 25 percent of its routes and would continue increasing 
operations each day he said an additional 700 unioncovered 
employees had crossed picket lines since noon friday pushing to 
1800 the number of union members on the job of that number 
however only about 350 were drivers the company also has 700 new 
hires 
union spokesman jeffrey nelson disputed curreys figures saying 
union officials believed just 10 percent of routes were in 
operation 
in the redding death police said the replacement driver 
continued on the route after the bus hit the striker he later 
flagged down a highway patrol officer and was taken in for 
questioning then released without being charged said police 
officer steve fiddler the officer was unable to explain why the 
driver stopped 
we dont believe that he intentionally ran over this person 
police investigator john severson said short of that were not 
going to say whether hes wrong or right 
initial reports to greyhound indicated the driver didnt realize 
he hit the picket said company spokesman george gravley in dallas 
company offials were told the striker was crushed when the bus 
backed up as the driver tried to maneuver around a pickup truck 
whose driver was trying to block the way out of the terminal 
gravley said 
the victim was robert waterhouse 59 of redding 30year 
veteran driver planning to retire this year 
the replacement driver theodore graham of portland ore had 
worked for two trucking companies and had a safe driving record 
with both of them according to his application to greyhound 
gravley said 
both union officials and greyhounds currey issued condolence 
messages to the dead mans family but currey went on to suggest 
the strikers were at fault 
everyone involved currey said will have to live with the 
circumstances of their behavior but especially the driver of the 
pickup 
the condolence statement by edward m strait president of the 
national union urged strikers and supporters on the picket lines 
to be extremely cautious 
currey said the company was seeking several court orders against 
picket line violence 
a pittsburgh judge issued an order friday limiting picket lines 
at the local station to three people 
in chicago where gunshots were fired at a bus and a terminal 
the first night of the strike a judge issued an order saturday 
against picket line violence two passengers were slightly injured 
by flying glass 
in philadelphia three men threw rocks at a bus late friday 
breaking windows and bruising a passenger police said the rocks 
were thrown after the bus carrying 15 passengers from washington 
stopped about two blocks from philadelphias downtown bus terminal 
because several women jumped in front of it two men were arrested 
in toledo ohio a picket was hit by a bus saturday but the 
striker wasnt seriously injured and the driver wasnt charged 
police said 
during the bus lines last strike in 1983 a striking greyhound 
driver was killed near zanesville ohio when he was run over while

westmar college trustees voted 
overwhelmingly saturday to become a branch of teikyo university of 
japan a merger that westmars president called a marriage but four 
trustees protested by resigning 
more than twothirds of the 37member board approved the merger 
after a sixhour session college president arthur richardson said 
at a news conference late saturday he declined to disclose the 
actual vote count 
the agreement will bring a substantial dowry to the tiny 
centuryold college and gives tokyobased teikyo its third branch 
in the united states teikyo has nine other campuses in japan and 
branches in england and holland 
robert rydell of des moines chairman of the board of trustees 
until he and three other members resigned to protest the merger 
agreement said he was terribly disappointed by the move 
they have called it a marriage but in my judgment the 
engagement period was way too short we didnt have a chance to get 
acquainted he said 
richardson said the board of trustees would dissolve itself in 
about 10 days and reform with at least seven members the majority 
of whom will be americans 
the acting chairman of the new board will be takashi yamanaka 
chairman of the executive committee at teikyos loretto heights 
university in denver 
the agreement clears the way for up to 200 japanese to arrive on 
the 62acre campus in april or may and join westmars 566 students 
when classes begin in september richardson said he said up to 200 
more would arrive in le mars about 20 miles northeast of sioux 
city for the fall term in 1991 
teikyo has an enrollment of more than 13000 students it 
already has agreements to buy loretto heights from regis college 
and to buy salem college in salem w va 
iowa is down to earth and its people have very healthy 
minds id like to introduce that to japanese its important to 
introduce your iowa values yamanaka said earlier 
faculty students and trustees were disappointed richardson 
didnt tell them what was going on until last month the merger 
talks began in november 
it did kind of happen all of a sudden richardson said 
but you cant announce a gift you dont have 
on the edge of financial collapse in the mid1980s when 
enrollment bottomed out at 417 students westmar has been searching 
for some kind of international arrangement he said 
others worried that the united methodist church would sever its 
relationship with westmar 
the college celebrating its centennial this year receives 
about 90000 annually from the church 
gregory clapper a methodist minister and the schools director 
of religion and philosophy programs said the schools mission is 
more important than money 
what has always been more important for many people than the 
money which the institution gives to westmar is the simple 
powerful symbolic statement we are a united methodist 
college clapper wrote in a letter published in the le mars 
daily sentinel 
le mars chamber of commerce president john boyd a 1967 graduate 
of westmar said the japanese students would help the local economy 
for every 1 spent that would be turned over seven times if 
a student from westmar comes in and spends 100 a month theyre 
infusing 700 into our economy boyd said 
other residents want the japanese to stay away 
our leaders in washington have been giving in to japan our 
expresident even went over and got paid off after he got out of 
office also why should we pay for all the military protection for 
japan and then let japan come over here and buy us out don 
eickholt of hinton said in a letter to the sentinel referring to a 
recent trip by former president reagan paid for by a japanese 
company 
i believe they want students schooled in this country so they 
will be able to take over his letter said the younger 
generation think dealing with japan is a way to make a buck and 
that is important to them who won world war ii i wonder

slavic heartland on sunday in a test of the communist party and 
government apparatus power to withstand rising demands for 
democracy

bering strait were to choose candidates for 1800 seats in the 
legislatures of the russian ukrainian and byelorussian republics 
thousands of seats in local governing councils also were being 
contested 
the balloting came in a period of increasing political tension 
as president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms reached a critical 
stage 
gorbachev has pressed the communist party into giving up its 
constitutional monopoly on power and the national congress of 
peoples deputies meets in a week to debate creating a new and more 
powerful presidency prodemocracy rallies in moscow and across the 
country have drawn hundreds of thousands of people 
but hundreds of longtime party and government officials were on 
the ballots and official newspapers were full of stories of 
campaign tricks and porkbarrel politics as they sought to avoid the 
kind of embarrassing defeats they suffered last year in balloting 
for the national congress 
balloting in the dominant slavic republics followed votes in the 
baltic republic lithuania swept by candidates endorsed by the

the only bishop to have signed a recent 
statement calling for drastic reforms in the roman catholic church 
says hes prepared to live with the reverberations 
christ didnt promise us an easy life bishop emerson moore 
said 
what we need is honesty and openness in the church true 
dialogue he said in an interview if that means i have to 
suffer for saying so thats all right 
but so far he said i havent been called a heretic my 
loyalty to the holy father pope john paul ii and his eminence 
cardinal john oconnor is certainly not in question 
the call for reform published wednesday as an advertisement 
in the new york times urged basic changes in the church including 
the ordination of women and married men as priests 
moore is one of seven auxiliary bishops who serves the 
archdiocese of new york under cardinal oconnor the most prominent 
conservative among american prelates 
oconnor said last week he did not believe the statement 
advances the spirit of the second vatican council he also 
complained that several of its proposals implicitly reject 
positions clearly affirmed by successive popes including pope john 
paul ii and can but lead to confusion about church teaching 
in theology causing confusion is a serious charge and moore 
said oconnor had told him how he felt about the statement 
but moore said he does not fear retribution 
there may be differences of opinion among us but the 
archdiocese has always been a family to me and supportive of me 
he said theres leeway to disagree thank god 
moore one of 13 black american bishops was arrested in 1984 
for blocking the entrance to the south african consulate in new 
york moore said oconnor supported his stand even though the 
cardinal would not have done that himself 
the statement moore signed was drawn up by several liberal 
catholic groups moore said he was particularly impressed with its 
complaint that groups are marginalized in our church because of 
race and ethnic identity 
the statement also says the church is crippled by its failure 
to address fundamental justice issues within its structures and 
is a stumbling block to both its own members and to society 
the statements signers said they see theologians silenced 
constructive opposition condemned loyalty oaths imposed and blind 
obedience demanded and church officials conducting financial 
dealings in secret without accountability to the people 
the statement asks the pope to share his power it asserts the 
right of priests nuns and lay catholics to help select their local 
bishops and to be consulted in the development of church policy on 
sexual issues 
the call for reform was initiated by chicagobased call to 
action a group that hopes to collect 100000 signatures by years 
end so far the statement has been signed by about 4500 catholics 
including a number of prominent theologians and numerous nuns and 
priests 
and one bishop 
moore said he received the statement in the mail several months 
ago and decided to sign because i was interested in its basic 
thrust even though i didnt agree with every statement one 
change of which he is particularly leery he said is the 
ordination of women 
margaret mcclory of call to action said moore was sent the 
statement because he was on the groups mailing list and that 
individual bishops were not asked to sign 
moore 61 converted to catholicism when he was 15 and became a 
bishop at the relatively young age of 44 he supported the 
presidential candidacy of jesse jackson although the church frowns 
on such political involvement by its clergy and repeatedly has 
asserted that the church has racist tendencies 
but when george stallings a black priest in washington broke 
away from the church last year and held his own services moore 
joined the other black bishops in renouncing his move 
mcclory said several catholics who helped pay for the ad asked 
that their names be withheld because they worked for church 
institutions 
moore said he did not think his own career in the church had 
been harmed then he added id much rather spend the rest of my 
life in new york anyway

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany is 
embroiled in controversy over his refusal to categorically accept 
the polishgerman border set at the end of world war ii 
it has become a political issue recognition of the boundary 
could cost kohl votes in the december west german election but his 
failure to renounce any future attempt to regain former territories 
lost in the war could delay german reunification 
kohl has come under attack from poland from the world war ii 
allies and from the opposition in west germany and even in his own 
cabinet for failing to give an unequivocal promise on the border 
there have been demonstrations in poland in support of polish 
demands to take part in talks on reunification 
but the chancellor faces considerable political risk if he 
declares the current border inviolable 
kohls christian democratic union is running only a couple of 
percentage points ahead of the opposition social democrats in 
public opinion polls 
the cdu traditionally has enjoyed the backing of conservative 
west germans including millions of exiles from territories now 
governed by poland and the soviet union 
more than 12 million ethnic germans were driven from silesia and 
east prussia after the third reich was vanquished the lands east 
of the oder and neisse rivers that were german before the war are 
now polish territory comprising about onethird of modern day 
poland 
if kohl agrees to give up the lands he could alienate those 
voters who provide his partys narrow lead over the social 
democrats 
however kohls equivocating has cost the cdu support in east 
germany where the social democrats are expected to win a majority 
in march 18 elections 
west german political parties have been active in the east 
german campaign in an attempt to increase their voter base in 
anticipation of unification 
kohl has to be worried that the addition of a solidly social 
democratic east german electorate could tip the political balance 
and deprive him of his dream of being the first chancellor of a 
reunited germany 
recognition of the current germanpolish boundary is likely to 
be one of the prices of unification demanded by the world war ii 
allies who will have a say in the shape of a united germany 
under pressure from washington where president bush urged 
clarity on the border issue kohl last week expressed understanding 
for polands concern 
his government also offered to respect the border between poland 
and a unified germany if poland drops any claims to war reparations 
and promises to protect the rights of its german minority 
but he has stopped short of saying germany would never seek 
recovery of those lands saying only a united germany could 
officially recognize its borders in a peace treaty 
in many speeches i have said that no one wants to connect the 
unity of the germans with moving the borders i dont know what 
more i can say kohl told east german television on wednesday 
he urged a declaration be made by both german parliaments to 
respect the postwar boundaries but exile groups claim kohl still 
supported them 
the chancellor has not qualitatively changed his position on 
this issue said horstegon rehnert spokesman for the 
2millionmember association of exiles in bonn we have 
absolutely no problem with this statement 
the conservatives view that nothing has been given up has left 
moderates and liberals concerned that kohl still sees the border 
question as open 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher whose free democrats 
are aligned with kohl in the bonn government has promised that 
unification will not be accompanied by any territorial demands 
the chancellors refusal to give in on the issue has won back 
some of the archconservative vote that strayed to the 
ultrarightist republicans party last year 
the republicans led by former waffen ss soldier franz 
schoenhuber polled as much as 10 percent in regional elections 
last year but have recently fallen to less than 4 percent support 
nationally 
schoenhuber has increased pressure on kohl by demanding eventual 
unification with silesia and east prussia offering a political 
haven for exiles and others who still seek recovery of the lost 
territories 
association of exiles director hartmut koschyk warned that if 
west germany renounces claims to the former german lands those 
driven out four decades ago will seek compensation of 59 billion 
from the bonn government for land homes and other assets left 
behind 
koschyk also predicted that as many as 500000 ethnic germans 
now living inside poland would emigrate to west germany if their 
hopes of unification were permanently dashed

the bush administration will unveil a national 
transportation policy this week calling for more local government 
and private help to improve air ground and water transportation 
into the next century 
the longawaited outline could lead to more toll roads higher 
airline ticket fares increased gasoline taxes in some areas and 
higher bus and mass transit fares 
major elements of the policy already have been disclosed by 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who says he wants to 
remove the heavy hand of government from transportation 
industries formal release is set for thursday 
skinners department faces formidable problems overcrowded 
airports with about 30 percent of all flights delayed a maritime 
industry in a record slump highway bridges in need of billions of 
dollars in repairs and an estimated 1 trillion to 3 trillion 
demand for airport railroad highway and mass transit construction 
over the next 20 years 
skinners solutions focus on increasing the nations reliance 
for transport on the private sector and state and local governments 
by stimulating competition and allowing the magic of the 
marketplace to work 
but skinner has said the policy also will commit the federal 
government to fully using the funds that people have paid in user 
charges for transportation for investments in transportation 
the unspent 76 billion in the aviation trust fund collected 
from an airline ticket tax and the 101 billion in the highway 
trust fund have been a sore point with transportation industry 
officials who say the money is going to offset the federal deficit 
rather than to help transportation 
some of the strategies skinner has said will be promoted in the 
new policy are increased user fees which he does not call tax 
hikes increased private investment including private construction 
of toll roads extending deregulation to the trucking and maritime 
industries and promotion of new technologies including highspeed 
rail systems and smart cars that are less likely to crash 
major points skinner has disclosed so far from the policy 
include 
promotion of a stronger healthier partnership among 
federal state and local governments with regulatory 
flexibility which skinner has said could include new powers to 
levy local highway tolls 
a concentration of federal assistance on projects of 
national significance although the projects will not be 
identified in the policy document 
preservation of existing transportation systems including the 
interstate highway system 
a focus on moving people and goods not just vehicles 
with promotion of highoccupancy vehicle lanes for crowded commuter 
routes 
encouragement of technology and innovation in all modes of 
transportation 
even before it has been released the policy has attracted 
criticism although skinner is widely praised for undertaking the 
task 
flexibility sounds like a euphemism for take care of 
yourself sen frank lautenberg dnj told skinner as the 
secretary unveiled a portion of his plan before a senate 
appropriations subcommittee last week 
sen alfonse damato of new york ranking republican on the same 
subcommittee said he feared the new policy would not help the 
continued development of large mass transit systems that take cars 
off the roads and decrease pollution 
carole perkins spokeswoman for the association of american 
railroads said the rail industry supports skinners efforts and 
appreciates his commitment to treat all industries evenly and get 
rid of unneeded regulations 
but she said railroad officials are looking for specifics and 
that it appears the policy will deal mostly in generalities 
airline industry officials have said they would like to see a 
separate policy outline from the federal aviation administration 
since skinners plan will give equal importance to all means of 
moving goods and people around the country 
one problem airline officials say the policy is unlikely to 
address is the need for unified noise standards at airports 
the new transportation policy is contained in a document that 
has passed the scrutiny of the white houses fiscal office the 
office of management and budget 
skinner told a congressional committee last week that reports 
that omb would impose significant changes in the policy were not 
true he described white house changes as wordsmithing only 
the policy is the result of 117 town meetingstyle hearings 
held in 48 cities over the past year 
parts of it already are being implemented according to 
transportation department officials and some of its proposals are 
contained in bushs fiscal 1991 budget including calls for airport 
passenger fees and other increases in revenue from transportation

the pentagon is wasting no time offering 
answers to one of the most compelling questions raised by the 
demise of the cold war who is the enemy now 
its drug runners terrorists third world despots and even oil 
spills the pentagon brass say 
at the same time they havent dismissed entirely the threat of 
soviet attack on the west even as moscow begins pulling its troops 
out of eastern europe 
the world has entered an era of violent peace says adm 
carlisle trost the navys top officer it is a time of reduced 
odds that the superpowers will lob nuclear missiles at each others 
cities but of more frequent and more lethal conflict among rival 
third world nations he told congress recently 
the message from the pentagon is that not only is the military 
needed for its traditional mission but that military might must be 
tailored to battle exotic new threats ones not previously 
considered big risks to the future of western democracy 
its unclear how this notion will sell on capitol hill 
lawmakers are looking for ways to carve a peace dividend out of 
next years defense budget many see the outbreak of peace as a 
chance to rein in the 300 billionayear military 
some private analysts say the pentagon legitimately is concerned 
by a proliferation of modern arms including chemical weapons in 
the third world but they say military leaders also may be 
overstating the immediacy of these dangers 
a civil war in a third world country for example may pose less 
danger to us security now than a few years ago when moscow may 
have been more likely to exploit such openings for the advancement 
of communism said alexis cain an analyst at the defense budget 
project a nonpartisan research group in washington 
even so instability in the third world is emerging as one of 
the us militarys main arguments against stripping it of manpower 
and modernized weaponry 
the pentagon is more desperate for missions now that the 
world order has shifted cain said 
the military leaders however insist its too soon to relax on 
any front 
perhaps we are at the end of the cold war however this does 
not mean the end of military rivalry among nations trost 
said it may well mean increased instability and violence 
a similar view was advanced by donald rice the air force 
secretary the likelihood that the us military will be called 
upon at some time and place to defend us interests in a lethal 
environment is high but now more than ever the time and place 
are difficult to predict 
thus the us military must be prepared to act as a force for 
stability in every corner of the globe the pentagon chiefs say 
but many in congress say its not yet clear just what needs 
stabilizing or if america is best suited for such a role 
sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
senate armed services committee and a strong supporter of the 
military told army secretary michael stone at a hearing feb 27 
that hed better find a more explicit mission than stability 
what do you put on a recruiting poster now join the army 
and become a stability force warner said 
each services civilian and uniformed chiefs have testified 
before congress in recent weeks on president bushs plan for a 
slight cut in next years defense budget and each has ticked off 
the same list of security threats said to be replacing the 
traditional worry about a soviet attack on western europe or 
america 
third world countries with increasingly sophisticated weaponry 
gen carl vuono the army chief of staff cited libya as an 
example he said it has more battle tanks than either france or 
britain several other countries including syria india and iraq 
each have more battle tanks than france and britain combined vuono 
said 
drug traffickers stone told congress on feb 21 that the drug 
trade has created an unprecedented and perplexing threat to our 
national security compounding the problem he said is evidence 
that terrorist groups are becoming more involved in narcotics 
trafficking as a revenue source and a network for buying arms 
terrorism gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff acknowledged to congress that military force is only 
infrequently the right answer to terrorism but stone said 
terrorism was a primary threat to american citizens 
the military says it also can make itself useful at home 
helping civilian authorities respond to disasters such as last 
years exxon oil spill in alaska

the spirit of the blue moon is evident before you 
enter the tavern a hangout for artists poets writers and other 
specimens of high life and low life for more than half a century 
the atmosphere is special northwest bohemian but is it 
enough to designate the tavern a cultural landmark and save it from 
the wrecking ball 
thats the question facing the landmarks preservation board on 
wednesday the owner of the dingy brick tavern wants to tear it 
down along with a strip joint and a house to make way for a 
residential and retail complex 
its a unique tavern and its a fun tavern but its not a 
historic landmark said robert hannah president of westlake 
capital corp which bought the building last september all this 
stuff about cultural landmark i think is stretching the truth 
supporters and the owners of the tavern concede it is 
architecturally insignificant they focus on its past patronage 
blue moon historians count writers jack kerouac and and dylan 
thomas among its former customers david wagoner is said to have 
written poetry in a back booth allen ginsberg abstract graffiti 
in the restroom and jack leahy the outlines for short stories on 
a wobbly table 
in january the landmarks preservation board nominated the blue 
moon but late last month the agencys staff recommended that 
landmark status be denied the staff report agreed with hannah who 
said the tavern failed to meet structural requirements mostly 
because of remodeling in the last 25 years 
landmark status would prevent the owners from tearing down the 
tavern and any remodeling would be subject to restrictions 
the building housing blue moon was built as a garage in 1923 and 
converted into one of the citys first postprohibition taverns 11 
years later its location was close to the boundary of an area 
around the university of washington where sales of alcoholic 
beverages were banned 
inside the clacking billiard balls raucous laughter animated 
conversation and gurgling taps drown out the bumpandgrind sounds 
from fan tan follies a strip joint next door 
its a scene of scruffy sociability among working stiffs bar 
stool leftists lawyers professors and students 
in a new republic magazine article after her first visit 
carolyn kizer described the blue moon as a grubby oasis just 
outside the universitys onemile sahara here the jukebox roars 
audrey the waitress slaps down schooners of beer and poets 
pedants painters and other assorted wildlife make overtures to 
each other 
hannah said it would be too costly to build around the existing 
tavern but hed like to incorporate the blue moon in the 3 
million project 
blue moon backers said that would be impossible 
we would look at it only as a lastditch resort said walt 
crowley a television commentator political activist and former 
mayoral aide who helped organize the 1500member forever blue moon 
committee 
he bemoaned the fate of other gritty taverns reopened in newer 
quarters 
they had their tummies tucked and their tushes taken up to the 
point that they became virtually unrecognizable crowley said 
their integrity has been essentially destroyed 
blue moon supporters include university of west florida 
sociology professor ray oldenburg author of the great good 
place he wrote that in the last 40 years the number of taverns 
in the united states has dropped from 152000 to fewer than 50000 
what were really talking about is an endangered species 
here oldenburg said in a telephone interview there is a 
cultural tradition here an interesting rather dingy but worth 
keeping kind of place

a mine exploded sunday while soldiers 
were exploring a tunnel allegedly dug under the border by north 
korea killing a sentry dog but causing no other casualties 
officials said 
the mine believed to be a booby trap exploded after soldiers 
sent the dog ahead and had groped their way about 700 yards north 
through the tunnel defense ministry officials said 
the army temporarily halted the search which began saturday 
after engineers drilled into the newly discovered tunnel in the 
demilitarized zone it was the fourth underground passageway found 
in the dmz and military officials said they thought there were 
about 20 more 
north korea has denied digging any tunnels 
ministry officials said they believed communist north korea 
might have installed the booby trap to block the search operation 
the tunnel was first detected in december in a remote 
mountainous region about 100 miles northeast of seoul south 
korean officials said sunday it was believed to have been dug in 
the 1980s unlike three other tunnels discovered in 1974 1975 and 
1978 
a government statement said the tunnel indicates north koreas 
strategy has been geared to winning a quick victory through a 
surprise attack 
north korea intends to break through our front line on the 
strength of their superior mobility and fire power advance 
speedily behind our forward areas and occupy seoul quickly it 
said 
the statement said tunnels were an integral component of its 
north koreas military strategy for quick action and quick 
victory and were intended to quickly neutralize our major 
frontline units 
the two koreas are separated by the 25milewide and 
155milelong dmz the border area on both both sides is heavily 
fortified by fences concrete bunkers mine fields and hundreds of 
thousands of heavily armed troops 
defense minister lee sanghoon said saturday that by analyzing 
satellite pictures and other information south korea knows of at 
least 26 underground axis lines beneath the dmz he said they 
are believed to be tunnels 
lee said north korea bought about 30 excavators with 
noiserepressing equipment from sweden after construction noises 
led to the discovery of the third tunnel in 1978 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 after world war ii no peace treaty was 
signed at the end of the threeyear korean war only an armistice 
and the two nations still are technically at war 
they remain bitter enemies and no unauthorized communication is 
allowed between their citizens

the government of jammukashmir state 
offered sunday to hold elections within six months in a bid to halt 
a moslem uprising and security forces launched new raids on 
suspected militant hideouts 
from our side we are willing to go for a democratic process 
to decide who should rule the state gov jagmohan said in an 
interview 
but the democratic process now depends on those who are 
terrorizing people he said referring to the moslem militants 
who demand independence from predominantly hindu india 
the militants boycotted novembers national parliamentary 
elections and forced residents in kashmir part of jammukashmir 
state to stay away from the polls 
but jagmohan the top administrator of the state said he had 
information that various militant groups were considering giving up 
their arms and adopting the democratic process to power jagmohan 
a hindu uses one name 
jagmohans statement could not immediately be reconciled with 
previous statements by militant groups who have rejected everything 
indian in their quest for a separate nation 
the last state elections held in 1987 were widely believed to 
have been rigged by the governing national conference party and its 
ally the congress party of former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
gandhis successor prime minister vp singh sacked the state 
government in january three years before its term was to expire 
and brought it under tighter federal control through the governors 
rule 
at least 163 people have been killed in kashmir since the latest 
round of secessionist violence flared up on jan 20 following a 
government crackdown on escalating protests bombings and attacks 
on state officials 
the government is following an iron fist in a velvet glove 
policy in dealing with the militants said an intelligence 
officer who is one of the five members of a policymaking team on 
kashmir he spoke on condition of anonymity 
on sunday paramilitary police and soldiers raided homes of 
separatist sympathizers and arrested 86 people in srinagar the 
summer capital of jammukashmir said state officials who cannot be 
identified under briefing rules 
state police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
at least 150 people had been detained for interrogation since 
friday 
srinagar a city of 1 million people and the focus of the 
militant movement remained under curfew for the third straight 
day troops patrolled the streets with orders to shoot curfew 
violators on sight 
the curfew was reimposed in kashmir early friday after 49 people 
were killed by security troops firing on moslem proindependence 
demonstrators 
the secession movement has alternately simmered and flared since 
194849 when the moslemdominated state of jammukashmir faced 
with accesion to india or pakistan chose india 
india and pakistan were then one year old having been 
partitioned along religious lines at the end of the british 
colonial rule on aug 1415 1947 
pakistan which claims jammukashmir has twice gone to war with 
india in 1948 and 1965 
sixtyfour percent of the states 6 million people are moslems 
nationwide moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million 
population hindus make up 82 percent

maybe its the bleak setting of 
windswept beaches brooding moors and gray weatherbeaten houses 
perhaps its all the ships lost off the coast carrying terrified 
souls into the stormy atlantic 
whatever the reason there are ghosts on nantucket just ask the 
people with stories to tell 
one person i knew thought it had something to do with the 
moisture says blue balliett who compiled 23 ghost sightings 
from this tiny island off the coast of cape cod and put them into a 
book i dont know what it is but there are a lot of ghosts on 
nantucket 
one story tells of a poltergeist residing in a house built in 
1808 and once owned ominously enough by a man named william 
coffin coffin a prominent wig shop owner died embittered after 
being accused of stealing 21000 from the nantucket bank in 1795 
twentyone years after the theft a convict in a new york state 
prison confessed to the crime but years of accusations and 
litigation had left coffin a broken man he even sued his distant 
cousin micajah coffin over the matter and he later wrote that he 
had been victimized by chicanery phrenzy and moonstruck 
madness 
peter benchley author of the book jaws spent a summer in 
the coffin house in the late 1960s he told balliett that one 
afternoon he woke from a nap to see a fire burning in the fireplace 
a longhaired old man dressed in 18thcentury clothing was 
slowly rocking in a rocking chair in front of the fire a moment 
later the man and the fire had disappeared and the rocking chair 
lay still 
out on the islands windswept eastern coast the normally 
levelheaded coast guard officers keeping watch over the 
140yearold sankaty lighthouse say a spirit haunts their nearby 
dormitory 
petty officer doug clark says the ghost scatters pots and pans 
over the kitchen floor opens locked doors and spooks the dorm dog 
jessie 
shell pop her head up suddenly and look around and theres 
nothing there clark says she gets on edge and she wont go 
near where the ghost might be 
but the hardy coast guard men dont put up with too many ghostly 
gags 
well hear it making loud thumps at night we just yell 
knock it off and it does 
sometimes a spirit reluctant to surrender its home to living 
residents will get too close for comfort 
joanne shaw a nantucket resident since 1972 recalls when she 
and her family lived in a 19thcentury farmhouse in the center of 
the island that was haunted by the ghost of a little girl they 
called emily 
she came down the stairs one day right in front of me shaw 
says she was about 10 years with a cloak covering her face i 
watched her for a minute and then when i started getting scared 
she disappeared 
the girl stayed mostly in a thirdfloor bedroom in the house 
she appeared to shaw and her son jimmy at various times for about 
two years and even if she wasnt visible the floorboards creaked 
as she passed 
then came the day shaw was taking a nap and felt the weight of 
someone getting into the bed next to her shaw was frozen with fear 
for a moment then jumped out of bed and screamed get out of 
here the ghost never returned 
the hauntings sometimes jinx real estate deals on the island 
though agents are loath to admit it 
a lot of people wont even look at a house with a reputation 
for being haunted said agent gary winn 
but we dont have any haunted listings at the moment he 
added 
in june ballietts second tome of nantucket ghost stories will 
be published this time with even more accounts she didnt intend 
to write another such volume 
but all these people who saw the first book came out of the 
woodwork balliett says on nantucket almost everyone has a 
ghost story to tell

congress wants to pump up president bushs 
foreign aid budget by as much as 2 billion and shift priorities to 
reward new democracies from nicaragua to czechoslovakia 
that move likely will be accompanied by more harsh rhetoric from 
majority democrats about the administrations timidity in seizing 
historic opportunities that the united states has sought for more 
than four decades in eastern europe 
we are facing a radically different world but the foreign aid 
request presented by the administration is changed almost not at 
all said rep david obey dwis chairman of the house 
appropriations foreign aid subcommittee 
we have a president whos unwilling to invest in things he 
rhetorically says are important added rep matthew mchugh dny 
the house foreign affairs committee last week formally asked 
house budget writers to provide an additional 2 billion for 
overseas accounts in the year that begins oct 1 bringing spending 
authority to 228 billion 
that budget category includes everything from bilateral military 
and economic aid to dozens of friendly countries to payments to 
the united nations and other international organizations to 
operations of the state department and the voice of america 
the administration has proposed 300 million for eastern europe 
in fiscal 1991 but it has offered few details and it remains 
unclear whether the money represents an increase from current 
levels or whether it simply continues a threeyear program of aide 
to poland and hungary begun last year 
the foreign affairs committee estimates the bush budget would 
actually fall 291 million short of maintaining current foreign aid 
programs so they propose additional money to go for economic aide 
to encourage the growing of alternative crops in 
narcoticsproducing countries additional money for aide to eastern 
europe including peace corps development assistance and increased 
assistance to africa the eastern caribbean and central american 
democracies such as nicaragua 
committee chairman dante fascell dfla wrote that the 
additional money is the essential minimum required to win the 
peace for democracy and free markets around the world 
others are calling for creating of a new fund for emerging 
democracies outside the normal foreign aid budget that could meet 
needs of newly eligible recipients who measure up to certain tests 
for political economic and human rights reform 
weve got a new situation said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee this is what 
weve been working for since the days of harry truman i think 
weve got to have some new thinking about what we do 
because of budget restraints and bushs nonewtaxes stance 
there is no new money to spend on aid or anything else any 
increase in aid must come from cuts in another part of the budget 
and most aid proponents are eyeing pentagon spending 
secretary of state james a baker iii in testimony on capitol 
hill last week indicated he sees little likelihood of a 
substantial increase in the aid budget and suggested instead 
cutting aid across the board to current recipients to free up some 
new cash 
but despite the unpopularity of aid among us voters members 
of congress are betting that the emergence of democratic 
governments in formerly totalitarian states will be a politically 
safe basis on which to send more money overseas 
most of our constituents want us to send no money called 
foreign aid overseas said rep jerry lewis rcalif but he 
added that as we go into a builddown within the military thats 
the time to increase our responsibility in foreign affairs 
added rep silvio conte rmass we need more resources right 
now to take advantage of this unprecedented perhaps temporary 
opportunity to win the cold war we will pay dearly for 
inaction 
aid proponents also believe that if defense spending for next 
year is cut by as much as 10 billion with most of the savings 
devoted to new domestic programs and deficit reduction public 
antipathy to a small foreign aid increase will be reduced 
the idea of increasing foreign aid also has some powerful 
support from the israeli lobby which is seeking to avoid cuts in 
its own aid by finding money elsewhere to meet the new demands 
as the top aid recipient in the world 3 billion of the total 
10 billion in us bilateral aid israel stands above the pack 
when the foreign aid budget gets tight and automatically becomes a 
target for cuts 
in addition to more money many lawmakers also are calling for a 
fundamental rewrite of the programs which send military economic 
development and food aid around the world policies which have for 
years been based on countering the communist threat need to be 
rebuilt on a new rationale they say 
we are all still very anticommunist its just hard to find a 
communist to be against said rep mickey edwards dokla we 
should create an albanian theme park so people can come see what 
communism was all about 
added edwards we are seeing the world remade in americas 
image we cannot be timid we have to move very boldly to 
ensure the new democracies do not slip back 
i think we should take a complete new look said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate appropriations foreign 
aid panel leahy said us policy goals have grown poorly defined 
and he challenged bush to show leadership first in setting new 
goals then in paying for them

crews with jackhammers and blowtorches 
tried for a second consecutive day sunday to bring down bucharests 
imposing statue of vi lenin but by nightfall he was still 
standing firm 
the crews succeeded in eliminating most of the concrete 
foundation that links the 25foot 7ton bronze statue to its 
marble base 
but engineers on the site said the statue would probably only 
come down monday morning when there would be enough light to do it 
safely 
about 1000 people watched the workers transfixed eagerly 
awaiting the banishment of the statue a symbol of the 45 years of 
communist rule that ended in december with the ouster of dictator 
nicolae ceausescu by a popular revolt ceausescu was executed 
together with his wife elena on christmas day after a summary 
trial 
the ruling provisional council of national unity which acts as 
a miniparliament until national elections scheduled for may 20 
voted friday night to remove the statue from in front of the 
massive staliniststyle state publishing house in the recently 
renamed free press square 
work began early saturday but the work crews were surprised to 
discover that the statue was implanted deep in its foundation by 
thick bronze rods a wrecking ball failed to move the figure 
a poster hanging on the motor of one of the cranes being used in 
the demolition work displayed the communist slogan march onward 
comrades with the addition dont come back and take the 
securitate with you a reference to ceausescus hated secret 
police 
the pink marble base of the statue was covered with blue 
graffiti reading down with the statue 
the black statue depicts lenin holding his cap and the lapel of 
his overcoat and staring into the distance down a broad avenue 
toward bucharests arch of triumph 
authorities said saturday they had not yet decided what they 
would do with the statue 
about a halfmile to the south in victory square meanwhile 
several hundred people demonstrated against the interim government 
they were kept well away from the provisional government 
building which was ransacked by demonstrators two weeks ago 
the military which did not intervene then brought out extra 
troops to surround the building sunday and blocked off its entrance 
with 15 armored personnel carriers 
the demonstrators chanted down with communists we want 
true liberty and we want free tv 
government critics are wary of the communist past of interim 
president ion iliescu and other former communists who ran afoul of 
ceausescu critics also complain about the governments allegedly 
heavyhanded control of television 
gheorghe higiu 45 said that the demonstrators had as their 
first priority supporting the peasants who form the base of this 
country 
higiu said that the demonstrators were demanding faster 
privatization of stateowned land which should be distributed 
free to each peasant according to his ability to work

where does mikhail s gorbachev live 
at no 10 kosygin street a paleyellow building perched on the 
highest bank of the moscow river with a magnificent view of the 
city and the kremlin if you believe sundays unusual performance 
when the soviet president walked back to this heavily guarded 
compounded after voting 
moscows filthy air is fresher in this industryfree 
neighborhood which enjoys a luxurious forest surrounding the 
stalinesque weddingcake skyscraper housing moscow state university 
from the street the yellow edifice appears to be just an 
unusually fine apartment building with a swingset on the back lawn 
next door is the dull gray building that was the home of the late 
alexei kosygin when he was soviet premier in the 1960s and 1970s 
and for whom the street is named 
but from the river below bay windows and balconies bespeak a 
rich residence designed to take private advantage of a stupendous 
site 
neighbors who watched it being built several years ago say the 
fivefloor building extends another five stories into the bedrock 
of the lenin hills a few hundred yards away a metro line zips 
straight to the kremlin wall 
the pentagon claims the lenin hills are laced with civil defense 
tunnels and rumors have long circulated in moscow that soviet 
leaders have a private underground train line from the kremlin to 
bunkers in this virtual cliff overlooking the capital 
the unmistakable zil limousines used by a handful of top soviet 
leaders only occasionally appear at the blockhouse guarding no 10 
kosygin street 
if gorbachev lives here he comes and goes underground said 
a westerner who lives in the neighborhood 
gorbachevs true home has always been a source of speculation 
the fourzil convoy widely assumed to carry the soviet leader 
routinely races down kutuzovsky prospect and rublovskoye shosse 
far and away the bestmaintained roads in a capital whose streets 
seem to have more holes than asphalt 
police clear traffic from the middle socalled zil lane 
every morning and evening to let the limousines sail by 
locals say that just past moscows outer ring road they turn 
right down an unmarked road visibly guarded by a lone policeman at 
night the route is brightly lit standing out in a city short of 
street lights and generally shrouded in gloom 
gorbachev is widely believed to spend most evenings at a dacha 
or country home in a wellguarded compound down that road like 
many areas on the outskirts of moscow foreigners are barred from 
setting foot in it 
during the june 1988 summit president reagan and his wife 
nancy dined with the gorbachevs at the dacha 
gorbachevs rare stroll down a moscow street sunday added new 
clues or red herrings to his trail the house at 10 kosygin 
street is variously said to be a guest house or one of gorbachevs 
residences 
after voting at the institute of chemical physics at no 4 
kosygin street he stopped to speak with passersby and reporters 
waiting for him both inside and outside the gates of the heavily 
wooded grounds of the institute then he walked briskly several 
hundred yards down the boulevard 
hefty security men roughly halted correspondents far from the 
security gates where the small crowd surrounding the leader 
shuffled positions and split up obscuring the whereabouts of 
gorbachev his wife raisa daughter irina her husband igor and 
their two children several drove away in two limousines parked 
outside and moments later a third zil departed from inside the 
compound 
if gorbachev had just left his city residence no one could be 
sure which long black vehicle carried him

house majority leader richard gephardt 
expressed disappointment sunday that president bushs weekend 
summit with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu produced no 
specifics on improving the two countries deteriorating trade 
relationship 
but gephardt dmo said congress will wait until summer to see 
if mutual pledges by bush and kaifu to work toward resolving the 
disputes produce results before lawmakers move to impose trade 
sanctions against japan 
nothing has changed gephardt said of the twoday california 
summit which was hastily called by bush after trade talks between 
the two countries stalled last month and the annual us trade 
deficit with japan fell by only 28 billion to 49 billion in 1989 
gephardt who has been a vocal advocate of strong retaliatory 
measures against japan said he heard no concrete proposals from 
bush and kaifu when they met with reporters saturday in rancho 
mirage calif 
how many of these press conferences have we seen over the past 
10 years gephardt said on nbctvs meet the press show 
what you never hear is a specific goal an action that both sides 
are going to take to deal with the problem 
kaifu said after the summit he would firmly tackle the 
product standards building codes and other structural impediments 
that effectively deny us products access to the japanese market 
bush wished him great success but asked if more trade talks 
between now and june could produce enough movement by the japanese 
to avoid us retaliation bush said i hope so but i dont 
know 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher in a separate interview 
sunday said both leaders left the summit realizing there are 
serious problems on both sides japan he said now has top 
government officials focusing on increasing their countrys imports 
now at the end of the year if there arent some major changes 
in that well know it was more rhetoric mosbacher said on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley program i believe 
they will 
gephardt said congress will wait until after talks are concluded 
on japanese barriers to us supercomputers satellites and forest 
products before deciding whether to impose new tariffs on japanese 
exports as part of the 1988 trade act congress imposed a june 16 
1990 deadline on those talks 
a summer deadline also exists on japanese imports of us 
semiconductors 
they want to see what actions the japanese will actually take 
as opposed to more promises and then theyll make up their mind as 
to what should be done next gephardt said of his colleagues in 
congress 
but he added that the overall trade relationship between the two 
countries will not improve significantly until the united states 
takes a firmer line and establishes targets for reducing the 
imbalance 
i would submit to you the japanese politicians are not able 
in present circumstances to make the changes in their own society 
that many of them know need to be made unless we are willing to 
take definitive action to help them do that gephardt said

if an engraved summons to a white house state 
dinner is the ultimate badge of social power an invitation to a 
preview breakfast at the national gallery of art is the elegant 
passport to a morning spent contemplating the power of the spirit 
about 500 journalists on the gallerys mailing list are 
accustomed to opening envelopes containing glossy reproductions of 
a winslow homer watercolor a frans hals portrait or the shimmering 
pastels of an henri matisse oil painting 
these coveted invitations surely among the most beautiful ever 
dropped into a washington mailbox are sent to the reporters and 
art critics who write regularly about the dozen or more major 
exhibitions that the national gallery mounts each year 
some recipients consider the invitations themselves to be works 
of art worthy of gracing the desks walls and bulletin boards of 
newsrooms around the city 
no less admired are the buffet breakfasts served in the 
refectory the seventhfloor penthouse suite of the gallerys 
modernistic east building where the culinary theme is taken from 
the artist of the day 
at 9 oclock tuesday morning for instance about 60 journalists 
will sit down to a hearty breakfast with a dutch flavor a salute 
to the gallerys march 11 opening of an exhibition of 97 landscape 
prints and drawings by rembrandt 
the menu will include pannekoeken or dutch pancakes filled 
with spiced apples and covered with powdered sugar and fresh 
whipped cream there will be boiled sweet ham a platter of aged 
gouda edam and memolette cheeses and small raisin buns called 
krantenbollen served with butter and blackberry preserves 
if he follows the usual format gallery director j carter brown 
will introduce the curators over coffee and discuss the new show 
with his customary wit good humor and boyish enthusiasm then the 
crowd will adjourn to the rembrandt gallery for an unhurried 
preview led by experts on the 17th dutch masters work 
i cant imagine a more civilized way to begin the day said 
one press breakfast regular 
we offer culture good food and good conversation says 
gallery spokeswoman deborah ziska 
the invitations are the work of chris vogel production manager 
of the gallerys editorial office and graphics designer phyllis 
hecht based on ideas conceived by exhibition curators and public 
information specialists 
ms ziska said it takes six weeks of consultations involving as 
many as 10 gallery officials including brown before the 
invitations are printed and ready for mailing to a nationwide 
preview list of 2500 names including the local breakfast group 
we like to do something different that will catch peoples 
eyes said vogel who started using artistic images on the 
gallerys invitations in 1984 
that year for an exhibition of folding screens by western 
artists vogel used a panoramic blackandwhite photograph by ansel 
adams for the cover of an invitation in the shape of a miniature 
folding screen 
since then he and ms hecht have collaborated to produce about 
100 such invitations with images ranging from renoirs eyepopping 
odalisque a voluptuous harem beauty to an amusing 
photograph of a weather vane fish waving an american flag from the 
shelburne folk art museum in vermont 
there was no dispute over the choice of an image for invitations 
to an exhibition of publisher walter annenbergs collection of 
impressionist and postimpressionist masterpieces which is 
scheduled to open here may 6 
that image will be the expected star of the show pablo 
picassos 1905 selfportrait titled au lapin agile annenberg 
bought the picture in november after the exhibition opened in 
philadelphia last summer for 407 million the third most 
expensive artwork ever sold at auction 
vogel is proud of his invitations but doesnt take his work 
home the wall of his house he said are reserved for the drawings 
of his 4yearold son philip

vice president dan quayle said sunday a new 
daniel ortega appears committed to democracy in nicaragua but 
predicted usbacked contras there will not disband until they 
feel more secure 
quayle praised the ousted sandinista leader as being very 
conciliatory after ortega promised on cbstvs face the 
nation show to turn over the reigns of nicaraguas government on 
april 25 and to respect its constitution 
i thought it was on target and perhaps it appears that we do 
have a new daniel ortega that is truly committed to democracy 
said quayle who was interviewed on the same show immediately after 
ortega 
he also had praise for former democratic president jimmy carter 
who monitored the nicaraguan election as being helpful in trying 
to promote democracy 
ortega was soundly defeated by presidentelect violeta barrios 
de chamorro in elections on feb 25 he said sunday he expects her 
to establish the countrys new government 
the constitution is the one that orders me to turn over the 
power to the government that is elected in the elections ortega 
said the new administration and the new president will designate 
the corresponding authorities 
asked if he would hand over control of nicaraguas armed forces 
and police ortega said i dont have an army here i dont have 
a police force here 
both chamorro and ortega have called for the demobilization of 
the contra rebels many of whom remain at camps in honduras the 
contras have said they would remain intact until after chamorros 
inauguration in april 
quayle said the key to demobilizing the 12000 contras is a 
peaceful transition while some contras already have laid down 
their weapons and returned to nicaragua they have done so on a 
voluntary basis he said 
when democracy is there and it appears that its going to 
be and when the contras feel secure they will demobilize he 
said thats part of the peace plan 
the focus he said should be on putting the principles of 
democracy to work rather than demobilizing the contras 
a group of nicaraguans is expected to be in washington monday to 
ask the bush administration for 300 million in aid 
asked what kind of economic assistance the administration is 
considering quayle would say only we will meet the demands of 
whatever is necessary 
on other issues quayle 
said there are no negotiations on a quid pro quo basis with 
iran for the release of us hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian shiite moslems he also refused to give any little 
nuance or any little credibility to reports the bush 
administration is somehow engaged in talks to free the hostages 
called the bush administrations policy on china a 
disappointment in that china continues to be a holdout of 
political reform 
saw no inconsistency in his decision to campaign for 
republican party candidates who believe in the right to have an 
abortion although the bush administration supports a 
constitutional amendment banning abortion quayle said the 
republican party is willing to be open on the issue 
said he wished his approval ratings were higher but hes 
given no thought to stepping down as bushs running mate in 1992 if 
his standing doesnt improve at the polls youre way down the 
road the president makes decisions like that not me

the coalition that defeated the ruling 
sandinistas in last months general election has charged that vote 
fraud cost it one seat in the legislature a newspaper reported 
sunday 
the newspaper also said that government helicopters fired 
rockets saturday at the home of a coalition supporter injuring two 
of his children 
but the government denied that helicopters caused the blast and 
another newspaper said it was caused by a grenade thrown by an 
unidentified assailant 
the charge of election fraud and the report of a helicopter 
attack appeared in separate articles in la prensa the daily 
newspaper owned by the family of presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro 
since mrs chamorro and her united national opposition coalition 
soundly defeated the leftist sandinistas in the feb 25 election 
la prensa has been considered an unofficial voice of the coalition 
it has strong ties to the top echelons of the new government which 
is to be inaugurated april 25 
there has been little serious violence in nicaragua since the 
election but after years of civil war some citizens wonder whether 
the transition to a new government and the disbanding of the contra 
rebels will occur peacefully 
nicaraguan rebels said sunday they have taken steps toward 
demobilization 
in a statement in honduras where the contras have camps rebels 
said they are in contact with uno leaders and that the speed of the 
demobilization will depend on guarantees of safety for those 
returning to nicaragua 
luis sanchez a united national opposition spokesman said the 
coalition will challenge the results of the latest vote count la 
prensa reported 
with the results from 4383 voting stations counted or 998 
percent of the total uno had 51 seats in the national assembly and 
the sandinista front had 39 two tiny parties had one seat each 
the leftist revolutionary unity movement and the social christian 
party 
sanchez accused sandinista militants of amending the vote counts 
to deny uno an additional seat in the singlechamber legislature 
la prensa said 
a frontpage story in la prensa said three sovietmade 
helicopters from the sandinista air force fired rockets that 
injured two children at the home of trinidad ubeda a united 
national opposition activist 
the report said the attack occurred about noon saturday in a 
neighborhood of jinotega a mountain town 100 miles northeast of 
managua it said ubedas two daughters were treated at a hospital 
for shrapnel wounds 
an official in managua denied the report 
they are trying to affect the prestige of the sandinista 
peoples army a defense ministry spokesman said in an interview 
with the associated press 
its illogical that we would commit such a stupid action a 
helicopter attack such as the one they describe would have leveled 
an entire city block not just a house he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the incident was under investigation 
the staunchly progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario quoted an 
unidentified interior ministry source sunday as saying the children 
were hurt when an unidentified person tossed a hand grenade into 
the home 
attempts by the ap to obtain independent confirmation of the 
details of the reported attack were not immediately successful

a state assemblyman whose district has 
been troubled by a dispute over indian hunting and fishing rights 
becomes the first wisconsin lawmaker to face a recall since 1932 
state rep james holperin of eagle river meets sayner 
businessman gene ahlborn in tuesdays democratic recall primary 
which was mandated by a petition drive brian sherren a st 
germain resort owner is running unopposed in the republican 
primary the general election is set for april 3 
holperins northern wisconsin district covers much of vilas and 
oneida counties two hotbeds for protests against spearfishing by 
the lac du flambeau chippewa one of six chippewa bands in the 
state and the most active at spearfishing 
nonindian anglers complain that the chippewa spearfishing 
discriminates against them and depletes fish populations 
but wisconsins chippewa bands retain the right to spearfish 
hunt cut timber and gather food off reservation under 19th century 
treaties that ceded northern wisconsin to the us government 
since a federal court upheld those treaties in 1983 chippewa 
spearfishers have been met at northern lakes in the spring by 
large rowdy and sometimes violent protests staged by treaty rights 
opponents forcing the state to spend millions of dollars to 
protect tribal members 
frustrations have risen on all sides of the issue in the last 
year as state efforts to negotiate multimilliondollar settlements 
with the tribes were defeated in tribal votes 
opponents of the indians rights vented their frustration at 
39yearold holperin this winter securing about 6000 signatures 
to force a recall 
the critics claim holperin has lost touch with voters on 
treatyrights issues specifically they said holperin supported a 
failed treaty rights agreement with the lac du flambeau chippewa 
that a majority of his constituents opposed 
no state representative has ever been successfully recalled in 
wisconsin the last recall election was in 1932 when republican 
sen otto mueller of wausau retained his seat 
observers generally agree republicans hold the balance of power 
in holperins district 
brian christianson sherrens campaign manager predicted many 
gop members may take advantage of wisconsins open primary law and 
vote in the democratic primary as they try to vent their 
frustration over the spearfishing dispute 
who they will vote for i dont know christianson said 
in that lies the great mystery of the campaign if jim holperin 
survives the primary are those republicans going to stay with him 
in the general election 
christianson said the treaty rights issue doesnt cut a clear 
path along party lines 
you have republicans who are sympathetic with holperin and 
union bluecollar democrats against holperin because they are 
sportsmen he said i dont think you are going to see a lot of 
voter apathy in this election 
some republicans want holperin ousted while others including 
gov tommy g thompson feel a recall isnt the proper forum for 
settling political differences over treaty rights he said 
sherren 40 and ahlborn 50 a buyer for a familyowned 
wholesale business are both making their first runs for the 
legislature 
reports filed with the state elections board showed that from 
jan 1 through feb 19 holperins campaign raised 25705 and 
spent 17480 
sherrens report indicated he raised 7710 and spent 2946 
ahlborns campaign spending report was not available but he 
said he intended to keep his spending below 10000

former national security adviser john 
poindexter goes to federal court monday for what may be the last 
major trial in the irancontra scandal 
poindexter faces charges that he conspired with former white 
house aide oliver north and others inside and outside the reagan 
administration to cover up norths secret supply network to the 
contras and us involvement in a shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
reagan gave videotaped testimony for the trial last month and 
poindexters lawyers are expected to play it back in court 
poindexter is the highestranking official in the reagan white 
house to go on trial in the affair the biggest foreign policy 
debacle of ronald reagans presidency 
accused of conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and 
two counts of making false statements poindexter could face up to 
25 years in prison and 125 million in fines if convicted 
poindexters fate will be decided by a us district court jury 
of 12 people selected from a pool of district of columbia 
residents jury selection begins monday 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb and defense attorney richard 
beckler will direct opposing teams of trial lawyers in a 
secondfloor courtroom of the us courthouse at the foot of 
capitol hill 
us district court judge harold greene will preside at the 
trial which could last up to eight weeks 
the indictment deals with poindexters assertions to congress in 
november 1986 that he didnt find out that hawk missiles had been 
shipped to iran in november 1985 until two months after the 
delivery the indictment also alleges that poindexter sent false 
letters to congress in 1986 that embraced earlier denials that 
north was assisting the contras militarily 
poindexter says his recollection of the november 1985 hawk 
shipment was very very fuzzy and that while he may have made 
incorrect statements he did not lie to congress 
my best recollection is that i did not remember anything 
about or know anything about the hawks until january 86 
poindexter told congressional investigators in immunized testimony 
in 1987 
the ciaassisted november 1985 shipment of hawks was authorized 
retroactively by a presidential finding which poindexter presented 
to reagan for signing after the weapons were delivered the 
politically embarrassing finding depicted the transaction with iran 
as straight armsforhostages trade poindexter destroyed the 
document hours after he told his alleged lies to congress 
former cia director william casey testified the same day 
telling members of the house and senate intelligence committees the 
cia had been told the cargo consisted of spare parts for oil 
drilling fields in iran casey gave no indication the cia and 
national security council staff knew that the shipment was arms 
in connection with the contra portion of the indictment reagan 
gave testimony that was favorable to poindexter reagan said i am 
in total agreement and in complete support of letters 
poindexter sent to congress 
poindexters letters endorsed information national security 
adviser robert mcfarlane gave congress in 1985 denying that north 
was raising money or providing military advice to the nicaraguan 
rebels mcfarlane subsequently pleaded guilty to crimes in 
connection with the information he had provided in letters to 
congress 
reagan said he hadnt known mcfarlane had pleaded guilty in 
connection with the letters and said he didnt know the tower 
commission which he appointed had concluded north was assisting the 
contras militarily 
in his videotaped testimony the former president said he didnt 
think poindexter had made any false statements in the irancontra 
affair 
in addition reagan suggested it might have been all right in 
november 1986 as the irancontra affair was unfolding to destroy 
documents and withhold information from congress that body 
explained reagan habitually leaked sensitive information that in 
this instance might have jeopardized the lives of us hostages 
held in lebanon 
part of the conspiracy charge accuses poindexter of working with 
north to destroy classified documents and records of the national 
security council 
north was convicted by a jury last may of three felonies in the 
irancontra scandal sentenced to 1200 hours of community service 
fined 150000 and given two years probation 
one of the crimes for which north was convicted aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress involved the november 1985 
shipment of hawks for which poindexter is now charged 
north is appealing the convictions and the fine while performing 
the community service in an antidrug program 
richard secord and albert hakim businessmen who assisted north 
in supplying the contras and ship arms to iran pleaded guilty to 
crimes in the irancontra affair and were placed on probation 
businessmen carl channell and richard miller who raised private 
donations for the contras pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud 
the government of taxes and were placed on probation 
the bush administration stepped in and blocked the use of some 
classified material in the case of joseph fernandez the former cia 
station chief in costa rica as a result of the action by attorney 
general dick thornburgh the judge in the case dismissed charges 
that fernandez lied about his assistance to norths contra resupply 
network irancontra prosecutors are appealing 
thomas clines a former cia agent who assisted north in locating 
sources of arms and shipping them to the contras is under 
indictment for alleged tax violations in the scandal and is 
scheduled to appear in federal court in baltimore later this month

rare light moment in days of political tension for gorbachev his 
proposal for a soviet presidency with vastly expanded powers comes

prime minister vp singh resigned as 
president of his janata dal party in keeping with earlier promises 
to step aside to avoid holding two offices a party spokesman said 
sunday 
singh resigned late saturday at a party meeting called to 
discuss alleged vote fraud by a party leader spokesman jaipal 
reddy said the party leader om prakash chauthala was also 
accused of inciting violence during a byelection last month 
in a measure seen as a facesaving move in the absence of 
chauthalas resignation the press trust of india said the party 
sunday recommended the election commission repeat balloting in 
meham harayana state where chauthala was a candidate 
reddy denied the prime ministers decision was linked to the 
election dispute he said singhs decision was in accordance with 
his repeated declarations he would not hold two offices to avoid 
conflict of interest 
singh became prime minister in december promising to uphold 
democracy and respect public institutions which he said his 
predecessor rajiv gandhi had ignored in the past government 
leaders have used benefits for party business opening them to 
charges of misuse of public office 
a new delhi english language newspaper indian express said 
singhs decision would have implications for many others in the 
janata dal who hold both a party post and public office 
reddy said singh was asked to continue as party leader until 
alternative arrangements are made 
chauthala the eldest son of deputy prime minister devi lal was 
appointed to the post of chief minister but was required under 
indian law to seek the voters mandate to ratify his position 
news reports said that in the feb 27 byelection in meham 60 
miles northwest of new delhi violence broke out when chauthalas 
supporters tried to stuff ballot boxes and intimidate voters 
a second vote feb 28 also was marred by rigging and violence 
that left at least 13 people dead and chauthala was blamed 
the byelection was held along with balloting for eight state 
legislatures and lawmakers in a federally controlled territory 
gandhis congress party suffered heavy losses in the elections 
while singhs janata dal and the rightwing hindu fundamentalist 
indian peoples party made strong gains

mikhail s gorbachev said sunday that the breakup 
of the soviet union could be more devastating to his country than 
the ruinous cultural revolution that wracked china for 10 years 
the soviet leader spoke to reporters after voting in elections 
for the russian republic asked if he could put up with the baltic 
republics declaring independence gorbachev said that trying to 
disentangle the nationalities of the soviet union after decades of 
living together would lead to trouble comparable to the upheaval in 
china that started in 1966 
just think of more than 60 million people living outside their 
national lands gorbachev said referring to the more than 100 
nationalities in the soviet union 
just imagine these millions of people on the move he said 
this will throw the country back this will bring trouble to 
people who have lived in some place for decades which has become 
their second motherland 
over these decades the interests of the republics and the 
people have become so entangled that if we now started to divide 
the entire country this would lead to trouble he said it 
would be worse than the cultural revolution in china this simply 
cannot be allowed to happen 
mao tsetungs attempt to revive revolutionary fervor in china 
sparked a violent struggle for power that led to the closing of 
universities for four years destruction of antiquities and a 
devastating setback in the countrys economic development an 
estimated 1 million people died 
ethnic tension and demands for independence from small republics 
increasingly threaten soviet unity 
the latest unrest was reported in the city of parkent in the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan official reports said at 
least one soldier was killed saturday in unrest in the city it was 
not clear what sparked the violence but uzbekistan has been the 
scene of ethnic unrest in the past 
the baltic republics of latvia lithuania and estonia have been 
campaigning to regain the independence they had before being 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
some lithuanians are calling for their newly elected parliament 
to take office and vote on independence this week before gorbachev 
can win approval for a presidency with vastly expanded powers 
separatists fear the more powerful position could be used 
against them some have said it could lead to restoration of a 
dictatorship because it would allow the president to suspend 
republics parliaments and send in troops without the approval of 
local authorities 
gorbachev promised sunday that a revision of his proposal due 
to be published this week would ease these fears 
there will be no possibility of repeating what happened in the 
years of the commandadministrative system he said referring to 
the regimes of his predecessors 
if gorbachevs proposals are approved by national legislators 
the first president to hold the wider powers expected to be 
gorbachev would be elected by parliament subsequent leaders 
would be chosen in a national vote 
gorbachev said sunday that he would not refuse nomination to the 
post 
he also gave some support to nationalists in the soviet union 
saying i do not think that the striving for national 
independence selfreliance and sovereignty is ambitious 
but he said it should be achieved through a reformation of the 
soviet structure as a federation 
at a meeting sunday of the moscow tribune a progressive 
citizens group member anatoly akhutin warned that the presidency 
proposal is a way of introducing a general state of emergency 
another member vladimir bibler called for signatures on a 
resolution terming the proposal antidemocratic unless the nation 
first establishes a promised multiparty system a new constitution 
a stronger parliament and direct popular election of the president 
gorbachev has supported all of these yet none has been 
implemented

israels four top leaders on sunday debated 
us proposals for opening middle east peace talks but they failed 
to bridge differences blocking a response to the plan 
vice premier shimon peres leader of the centerleft labor 
party insisted that the cabinet vote on the compromises by 
wednesday but officials in prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc objected 
in matters pertaining to israeli survival we have to make 
decisions by ourselves without a gun to our temple said 
transport minister moshe katzav a shamir ally 
deputy premier david levy likuds leading opponent of the 
compromises threatened to resign if the cabinet agrees to the us 
plan 
peres said shortly before sundays meeting of the forum of 
four two leaders from each of the main parties that he ould 
hold likud to a wednesday deadline for putting the us proposals 
to a vote by the decisionmaking inner cabinet 
there is no need to wait the picture is clear he said 
labor leaders have threatened to quit the governing coalition if 
no decision is made by wednesday but defense minister yitzhak 
rabin another labor leader said he could wait until next week for 
the 12member inner cabinet to make its decision 
the forum of four which includes shamir and foreign 
minister moshe arens of likud and peres and rabin of labor met for 
45 minutes sunday 
rabin later told israel army radio that they failed to decide on 
the proposals by us secretary of state james a baker iii because 
likuds ministers remained divided 
baker has been trying to bring together israelis and 
palestinians for preliminary talks in cairo on israels plan for 
elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the elections 
would be a step toward limited autonomy for the territories which 
israel has occupied since 1967 
baker reportedly wants to start the talks april 2 but likud has 
resisted his proposals to include residents of arab east jerusalem 
and two palestinians who were deported by israel among the 
palestinian negotiators 
those proposals were intended to meet plo demands to include 
outside palestinians in the talks but still meet israels demand to 
only talk to residents of the territories 
likud officials fear the compromises would bring members of the 
palestine liberation organization into peace talks and would raise 
questions about israels control of jerusalem israel refuses to 
talk to the plo which it views as a terrorist group 
according to israeli news reports baker has suggested a new 
formula of accepting in principle any negotiator who is a 
registered resident of the territories which could include 
deportees or palestinians with ties to east jerusalem individual 
names could be discussed later 
deputy premier levy remained staunchly opposed to the plan 
sunday 
the formula in essence includes all the dangerous elements 
that likud opposes he said 
shamir spokesman avi pazner denied earlier reports that the 
premier favored bakers ideas 
the prime minister hasnt told anyone if he supports the 
proposals or not he hasnt had his say pazner said

millions of soviets from the polish border to the 
bering strait voted sunday in what president mikhail s gorbachev 
said was a struggle between reform and bureaucracy for the 
countrys slavic heartland 
i think it is a battle gorbachev told reporters after 
voting in the lenin hills area of moscow but i am convinced that 
perestroika will win 
almost 150 million voters were registered to choose among more 
than 11000 candidates for 1800 seats in the legislatures of the 
russian ukrainian and byelorussian republics thousands of seats 
in local governing councils also were being contested 
no results were expected until tuesday in the three republics 
which comprise the vast majority of the countrys territory and 
hold more than twothirds of the soviet unions 290 million people 
in the baltic republic of lithuania meanwhile proindependence 
activists said results in runoff elections sunday assured them of 
the quorum they need to covene the republics parliament where 
activists are expected to push for creating a mechanism to secede 
from the soviet union 
officials reported a strong turnout in the far east region and 
the ukraine where more than half of registered voters had been to 
polling stations before noon polls were open from 7 am to 8 pm 
there was increased political tension over gorbachevs reforms 
in the weeks leading to the elections 
gorbachev has pressed the communist party to relinquish its 
monopoly on power and pushed for a new more powerful presidency 
hundreds of thousands of soviets have turned out for prodemocracy 
rallies 
in the slavic republics reforms where they have managed to 
get started have proceeded more slowly and quietly than in other 
areas there have been neither the concerted drives of the baltic 
republics nor the violence of the caucasus and central asia 
gorbachev and soviet citizens said the local party and 
government officials seeking election were among national leaders 
most opposed to reforms 
our elections involve a new type of people people who have 
been given new impetus from perestroika a relaxed confident 
gorbachev said the essence of it is that it is a peoples 
referendum on perestroika 
the soviet leader who was accompanied to the polls by his wife 
raisa daughter soninlaw and two grandchildren urged soviets to 
come forward and take greater responsibility for themselves 
responding to reporters questions as he left the polling 
station at the institute of chemical physics the soviet leader 
said it was not particularly important whether the victors were 
communist party members 
the 20million member party is trying to get much closer to the 
people and so the question of proportions is not crucial he 
said 
it is important that people are there who support perestroika 
and are prepared to move this process ahead communist or nonparty 
members all will be good enough he said 
hundreds of longtime party and government officials were 
candidates 
in russia alone the ballot contained 25 heads of regional 
communist party organizations and 36 chairmen or deputy chairmen of 
autonomous regions within the giant republic 
in the days before the balloting official newspapers were full 
of stories of campaign tricks and porkbarrel politics officials 
sought to avoid the kind of embarrassing defeats they suffered last 
year in balloting for the national congress of peoples deputies 
voters in the ukraine selected a 450member supreme soviet 
legislature byelorussia chose a 310member legislature and russia 
elected a 1068member congress that will choose a legislature and 
leadership from among its members 
reformist communist leader boris yeltsin who voted at a 
childrens center in central moscow told reporters the turnout was 
likely to be significantly lower than balloting for the 
national congress last march in that race soviets were given 
their first choice of candidates in more than 70 years 
yeltsin was a candidate for a district in his ural mountains 
home of sverdlovsk 
as the communist maverick appeared several people waiting for 
him whispered among themselves here comes the president of 
russia a reference to his candidacy for the new post of the 
presidency of the republic to be elected by legislators 
voters on the kamchatka peninsula of the soviet far east who 
were among the first to go to the polls had as many as 12 
candidates to choose from for each seat in leningrad 280 
candidates were seeking 34 seats 
about 3000 candidates in the ukraine were vying for 450 seats 
in the republics supreme soviet and in byelorussia there was an 
average of five candidates for each seat the tass news agency said 
vitaly boiko chairman of the ukrainian election commission 
said from kiev that as of 6 pm more than 80 percent of the 37 
million voters had gone to the polls 
in my opinion its explained by the fact that people want 
perestroika to go faster they want the formation of the new organs 
of soviet power to be completed he said 
sergei odarych an election official for the informal ukrainian 
political group rukh reported minor irregularities but said the 
problems were easily straightened out 
ivan likhach official of byelorussian election commission said 
from minsk that about half the eligible voters had been to the 
polls by noon and turnout was running ahead of last marchs 
elections 
activism is higher this year he said 
ukrainian communist party chief vladimir a ivashko a member of 
the national party politburo faced 11 challengers 
official reports said 86 percent of candidates in the russian 
elections and 80 percent in the ukraine were members of the 
communist party 
newspapers have been filled with reports of campaign tricks the 
workers tribune newspaper said workers in one moscow district were 
paving over snow to meet the campaign promise of mayor valery t 
saikin and appease voters who swore they wouldnt vote unless 
parking lots were built 
saikin defeated a year ago in national elections was a 
candidate for reelection to the 498member moscow city council 
balloting in the slavic republics followed an election in the 
baltic republic of lithuania swept by candidates endorsed by the 
proindependence sajudis movement and several other republics 
voters in 28 lithuanian districts cast ballots in runoff 
elections sunday runoffs in the remaining 17 districts not settled 
in the feb 24 election will be held later in the week tass said 
on sunday at least nine deputies to the lithuanian supreme 
soviet were elected eight of them supported by the 
proindependence movement sajudis said longinas vasiliauskas a 
sajudis spokesman twothirds of the 140member parliament must 
have been elected before a session can be called 
observers have speculated that sajudis wants a quick parliament 
session so lithuania can vote to secede from the soviet union 
before gorbachev gains his expected broad new powers which include 
the right to suspend republic parliaments and send in troops 
the soviet congress meets next monday to consider gorbachevs 
proposal 
vasiliauskas said the lithuanian parliament would not vote to 
leave the soviet union immediately but wants to create the 
mechanism for secession because we dont know what gorbachev will 
do after hes elected president

hawaii and two of every five hotel rooms in waikiki the states

communist party leader gregor gysi trying to 
boost his partys election standings with a skydiving stunt 
suffered an early setback sunday when high winds forced him to call 
off his parachute jump 
communist premier hans modrow meanwhile was headed to moscow 
for talks with a worried kremlin about trade and security after the 
march 18 elections which are expected to sweep the communists out 
of power and speed unification with west germany 
the communists are running a distant third in the campaign for 
parliamentary seats in east germanys first competitive election in 
its 40year history 
gysi addressed a rally in east berlins hellersdorf region then 
suited up for his planned skydiving stunt after which he was to 
have landed back at the rally site but the jump was canceled 
because of galeforce winds that swept through berlin over the 
weekend 
gysi 41 is attempting to boost the communist image which has 
been badly tarnished by past corruption and abuses of power he 
drew a capacity crowd at east berlins house of parties for a 
campaign appearance before the scheduled jump 
he promised that communist lawmakers would fight to ensure that 
40 years of social accomplishments are not wiped out by a hasty 
merger with west germany 
as officials from both sides negotiate how to mesh the two 
german economies and societies after four decades of division east 
germans have become fearful of unemployment huge rent increases 
and other consequences of capitalism 
east germanys adn news agency said modrow was to meet with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on monday to discuss 
reunification 
adn citing unidentified sources in moscow suggested that the 
soviet leadership remains concerned about how german unification 
would influence the soviet economy and security east germany has 
traditionally been the soviets most important trading partner and 
defense ally 
the soviets have indicated they will allow reunification but 
gorbachev has said the new nation should be militarily neutral 
west german chancellor helmut kohl says a united germany should be 
part of the nato alliance 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher on sunday 
reiterated his view that west germany should make clear its intent 
to respect polands current western border after reunification 
in an interview with the zdf television network genscher 
further distanced himself from kohl who has refused to provide 
poland a guarantee 
genschers free democratic party is a junior partner in the 
government with kohls christian democratic union 
poland has asked that the two germanys begin work on a treaty to 
recognize the oder and neisse rivers as the permanent border 
between germany and poland it is afraid a reunited germany might 
press claims to prewar territories that now make up about a third 
of poland 
kohl apparently fearing the loss of archconservative voters in 
december elections has refused to provide a guarantee saying it 
would be up to a reunited germany to decide 
but he said friday that he favors a reunited germany signing a 
treaty to fix the border if poland also agrees to waive all claims 
to war reparations and guarantees the rights of ethnic germans 
poland which already waived such reparations in 1953 has 
rejected kohls new suggestions 
in the zdf interview genscher issued a veiled warning to kohl 
that he should not bring into question issues that have already 
been resolved 
the border question was also expected to be a central topic 
during the talks between modrow and gorbachev

for its 100th birthday a small private 
college in northwest iowa is getting a new name millions of 
dollars and an affiliation with a japanese university 
westmar colleges board of trustees highlighted the schools 
centennial saturday by voting to become a branch of teikyo 
university of japan 
our community just got bigger and the world just got 
smaller westmar president arthur richardson told a cheering 
crowd of students faculty and residents after the board vote 
richardson refused to disclose the vote by the 37member board 
but said more than twothirds agreed to rename the school teikyo 
westmar university 
the agreement gives teikyo its third branch university in the 
united states teikyo has reached agreements with regis college to 
buy its loretto heights campus in denver and with salem college in 
salem w va 
the tokyobased teikyo has nine campuses elsewhere in japan as 
well as branches in england and holland 
richardson said the 566student college had been seeking an 
international agreement since the mid1980s when the school was in 
financial trouble and enrollment dipped to 417 
teikyo westmar university will receive 4 million from teikyo to 
refurbish dormitories and classroom buildings increase salaries 
hire additional faculty and to enroll as many as 400 japanese 
students by the fall of 1991 
as many as 200 japanese are expected to arrive this spring in le 
mars 20 miles northeast of sioux city 
richardson said the westmar college board would be dissolved and 
the new board would have at least seven members the majority 
americans an acting board chairman will be takashi yamanaka who 
is also chairman of the executive committee at teikyo loretto 
heights university 
richardson was criticized by some for waiting until last month 
to inform faculty and trustees about the proposal he began 
negotiating last november 
they have called it a marriage but in my judgment the 
engagement period was way too short we didnt have a chance to get 
acquainted said robert rydell of des moines chairman of the 
board of trustees until he and three other members resigned to 
protest richardsons actions 
it did kind of happen all of a sudden richardson said 
but you cant announce a gift you dont have

african prisons welcomed the south african black leader on the 
tarmac at harare airport as thousands cheered to the throb of 
tribal drums 
youre not a stranger mugabe declared youve come home 
where the 10 million people stand solidly behind the people of 
south africa in the unrelenting struggle 
children in feather headdresses chanted were going to 
pretoria to fight 
mandela said his african national congress was anxious for talks 
with the pretoria government 
we are trying to convince the white minority that it is 
madness that we should be killing one another when we can sit down 
talk and settle our problems he said 
the day they the south african government decide to settle 
with the acknowledged leaders of the country and the day they 
commit themselves to a democratic and nonracial south africa they 
will be accepted in the region in africa and other parts of the 
world with open arms mandela said 
zimbabwe a former british colony that won independence after a 
bloody guerrilla war is the second stop on mandelas fournation 
tour mandela now vice president of the anc will leave for 
mozambique in three days and later travel to sweden to visit ailing 
anc president oliver tambo 
mandela 71 was freed feb 11 after more than 27 years in 
prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government 
in zimbabwe he will witness firsthand how whitegoverned 
rhodesia was transformed into blackruled zimbabwe aides to the 
anc leader say he views zimbabwe as a possible model for a future

rhodesian prime minister ian d smith before he led the sevenyear 
war that ended with independence in 1980 
on sunday giant portraits of mandela festooned lampposts and 
trees on the road to the airport one placard displayed at the

fw de klerk who says he wants to bring blacks into the political 
system has lifted bans on opposition groups and initiated other 
reforms 
speaking to thousands of mugabe loyalists at a soccer stadium 
mandela said the key to south africas future lies not only in the 
black majority gaining the vote but also in the unity of rival 
black factions 
he pointed to the example of zimbabwe where mugabe formally 
merged his political forces last year with those of his chief 
rival joshua nkomo 
since coming to power mugabe has pursued a policy of 
reconciliation between whites and blacks rival tribes and 
opposition political movements whites have held cabinet posts

two sisters separated in cambodia were 
reunited 16 years later when one of the women happened to go into a 
providence restaurant where the other one worked 
sideth prak 30 was running the kitchen at the phnom penh 
restaurant two weeks ago when she noticed one of the customers 
bhopa ros 
the womans tiny figure and solemn expression were much like her 
own she listened to the womans voice and went running back to the 
kitchen 
i think thats my sister out there she told her husband 
bhopa then 8 had become separated from her family when the 
communist khmer rouge arrived in phnom penh in 1975 sideth was 
visiting an uncle in another province and was trapped there when

exports despite the citys declaration as a nuclearfree zone 
morflot freightliners wants to use the nuclearpowered 
sevmorput an icebreakercontainer carrier for grain shipments 
from march through july at canadas main west coast port 
morflot officials said they wanted to determine the councils 
position before before asking transport canada for permission the 
issue is on the councils agenda for tuesday 
a report by morflot freightliners to city council described the 
33900metricton ship as unsinkable and mentioned four 
protective barriers around the nuclearpowered steam plant 
that failed to mollify mayor gordon campbell and peace and 
environmental activists 
i have consistently voted to make vancouver a nuclearfree 
harbor campbell said saturday weve told the federal 
government we dont want nuclearpowered or nuclear 
weaponscarrying ships in vancouver harbor 
its totally totally outrageous that they are even 
considering coming to vancouver said john mate of greenpeace

the soviets reactor safety record is appalling said 
michael wallace a political science professor they are

four thousand people set out sunday on a 25th 
anniversary reenactment of a historic votingrights march to 
montgomery including a replay of a bloody confrontation with 
police on a bridge 
the group returning to the edmund pettus bridge was led by such 
civilrights figures as jesse jackson and coretta scott king among 
them were some of the original marchers including us rep john 
lewis hosea williams albert turner and fd reese 
we shed a little blood here that made a difference people are 
now registering to vote said lewis dga 
halfway up the bridge sunday smoke was released to simulate 
police tear gas and marchers two abreast retreated some falling to 
the ground 
on march 7 1965 on the day remembered in civil rights annals 
as bloody sunday police used billy clubs and tear gas to turn back 
hundreds of marchers on the bridge named for a confederate general 
lord knows were not where we ought to be but thank god were 
not where we used to be williams said as he crossed the bridge 
weve come a long way but lord knows weve got a much further 
way to go 
the 50mile march will continue in segments each day through the 
week before culminating with a rally march 10 at the alabama 
capitol after crossing the bridge most of the crowd turned back 
to selma leaving several hundred to continue a short distanct 
toward montgomery before stopping for the night police said 
jackson speaking earlier sunday from the first baptist church 
pulpit to about 600 people said martin luther king jr did not die 
and nelson mandela did not languish in a south african prison for 
27 years for blacks not to exercise their right to vote 
you cannot walk around here with these unused blessings 
jackson said adding that 35 percent of all blacks eligible to vote 
are unregistered god has given us all these votes when you drop 
them they become snakes and go to washington and bite us 
two weeks after the 1965 violence at the bridge stopped the 
first march king and other notables led a second march 
authorized by a federal judge and protected by thousands of federal 
troops all the way to montgomery the events including ku klux 
klan violence against the march galvanized congress to pass the 
1965 voting rights act 
the law lowered voting barriers to blacks across the south and 
eventually led to a sharp increase in the number of both black 
voters and black officeholders in selma alone the number of black 
registered voters has climbed from about 600 in 1965 to 10800 now 
three of the five members of the dallas county commission are 
black four of the nine members of the selma city council are black 
we have another bridge to go across now the racial bridge 
the bridge at selma high jackson said 
at the high school about 150 black students staged a sitin 
last month that led to a weeklong systemwide halt of classes while 
other blacks intermittently occupied city hall 
the protests stemmed from the whitemajority school boards 
refusal to extend the contract of the 75 percent black systems 
superintendent norward roussell the systems first black school 
chief 
lewis who was injured on bloody sunday said the clash on the 
bridge created a sense of righteous indignation across the 
country and resulted in demonstrations in more than 80 cities 
the movement created a climate for president johnson and for 
the congress to say yes while many had a desire to say no said 
lewis 
bloody sunday helped make america a little more caring a 
little more sharing said lewis 
the johnson administration had focused itself on vietnam and the 
war on poverty until bloody sunday after the clash and the death 
a few days later of james reeb a white unitarian minister from 
boston who was hit in the head while on a selma street johnson put 
the passage of the voting rights act on his priority list 
also killed after the march to montgomery was viola liuzzo a 
white homemaker from detroit shot by nightriding ku klux klansmen 
while she drove demonstrators back to selma

prime minister toshiki kaifu left behind friendly 
talks with president bush and returned home sunday to political 
realities likely to dampen any postsummit euphoria 
japanese officials accompanying kaifu said the summit in palm 
springs calif could fortify kaifus position as he tries to carry 
out pledges of economic reform 
after his warm welcome in california however kaifu faces a 
decidedly cooler reaction in tokyo where there is opposition to 
traderelated economic reform both in his liberal democratic party 
and in the oppositioncontrolled upper house of parliament 
the summit hastily arranged only a week in advance had been 
widely expected to put kaifu in the unenviable position of having 
to fend off criticism that japan is dragging its feet in cutting 
its 49 billion trade surplus with the united states 
but during their talks friday and saturday kaifu and bush 
avoided detailed discussion of specific trade topics under 
negotiation 
kaifu responded to bushs request for substantive progress on 
both the structural impediments initiative talks aimed at 
attacking the trade imbalance indirectly through economic reform 
and in other disputed trade areas with a pledge to do my best 
i told the president i am asking for cooperation and 
understanding from my people from businesses and from involved 
government agencies kaifu told reporters in the united states 
among all three groups kaifu faces stubborn resistance to 
change and a tradition of cautious slow decisionmaking that will 
hinder efforts to meet deadlines for progress on trade issues 
proposals include streamlining japans byzantine distribution 
system with its many middlemen hastening the opening of 
pricecompetitive large stores and strictly enforcing 
antimonopoly laws 
landuse reforms aimed at increasing space for muchneeded 
housing and at cutting exorbitant land prices could eventually hit 
the real estate values underpinning much of japans enormous 
financial wealth 
the road is not smooth we are dealing with things both 
societies have tried to rectify for decades acknowledged yukio 
okamoto director of the first north american division of the 
foreign ministry 
many japanese government and business leaders said sunday they 
were happy with the results of the summit and vowed to work hard 
to settle economic conflicts with the united states 
i think the summit was particulary meaningful because 
president bush was considering japan as a global partner said 
rokuro ishikawa president of the japan chamber of commerce and 
industry 
yutaka kume president of nissan motor co japans second 
largest automaker said it was very useful that the two leaders 
discussed economic issues 
he added but just consultations between the governments 
arent enough after returning from the united states i think the 
kaifu cabinet must hear views at home including those of business 
circles 
many analysts and officials believe kaifu a newcomer to inner 
political circles lacks the clout to build a consensus to back 
such extensive reforms 
kaifu 59 belongs to the governing liberal democrats weakest 
faction despite his partys victory in a feb 18 lower house 
parliamentary election he remains heavily dependent on the support 
of more powerful party leaders 
the new prime minister came to power in august to try to restore 
the battered image of his party prime minister noboru takeshita 
resigned last spring to take responsibility for a bribery scandal 
he was replaced by sousuke uno who resigned two months later after 
an election defeat in parliaments upper house 
kaifu also must deal with an upper house dominated by a 
coalition led by the japan socialist party which has adopted a 
protectionist stance in recent elections

hundreds of machinists union members their 
relatives and other supporters chanted one day longer sunday 
outside eastern airlines headquarters as they marked the first 
anniversary of their strike 
the enthusiasm and determination and spirit of the real 
eastern employees has not wavered one bit charles e bryan 
president of machinists district 100 told the rally its become 
a cause for justice 
hundreds more strikers and supporters rallied at laguardia 
airport in new york and other cities with large eastern union 
memberships strikers rallied saturday at atlanta 
most in the miami crowd estimated by police at from 500 to more 
than 2000 strong wore bright red union tshirts in the rally next 
to the union local hall across the street from easterns corporate 
headquarters police guarded the company buildings some splattered 
red and yellow by paint bombs and some with broken windows 
the strikers then went to miami international airport to march 
through the eastern terminal 
the strikers chant one day longer meant they would endure 
one day longer than texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo whose 
company bought eastern four years ago and who is the focus of the 
bitter strike 
were making a statement its to show people were still 
around said jim bertram a former eastern flight simulator 
technician 
he and most other eastern machinists members mechanics and 
other maintenance ground services workers have gone on to other 
jobs in most cases for less pay though there seems to be no 
serious hope for settlement of the strike the machinists said they 
are showing they wont give in to what they call lorenzos 
unionbusting and his dismantling of eastern 
i think basically the accomplishment of the strike is a 
philosophical idealistic one said elaine segura a 20year 
eastern clerk who struck with her husband paul a 23year 
mechanic these people who have suffered for a year still have 
the enthusiasm and perserverance the answer to lorenzo is still 
no 
the strike which came after 1 years of federal mediation over 
a contract calling for wage and workrule concessions virtually 
shut down eastern at first when pilots and flight attendants joined 
the nearly 9000 machinists 
eastern filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days 
later and began hiring new workers while trying to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier today eastern has 18000 employees compared to 
more than 30000 before the strike and 800 daily flights compared 
to nearly 1100 when the strike began 
the carrier has been losing 2 million a day as it struggles to 
emerge from bankruptcy protection the pilots and flight attendants 
ended their sympathy strikes three months ago but eastern has 
taken only a few back saying it has no openings 
the company didnt observe the anniversary spokesman robin 
matell said 
the bottom line is a year later there are no winners only 
losers matell said there were an awful lot of people who got 
hurt 
at least we were able to preserve 18000 jobs to build a 
new airline from scratch 
machinists officials continue to hope for a buyout of lorenzo 
although a series of prospective buyers has backed away in the past 
year bryan told the crowd that chicago options trader joseph 
ritchie remains interested in buying eastern and was encouraged by 
a bankruptcy examiners study of texas airs eastern transactions 
that resulted in texas airs agreement to pay 280 million to 
eastern 
george kourpias the machinists union international president 
told the rally the union would continue fighting texas air in court 
while keeping up food donations and other help to the strikers 
bryan urged his members to take heart from the overthrows of 
dictators in eastern europe 
when you look around all youve got left is castro and 
lorenzo bryan said to cheers referring to cubas communist 
leader

a police official on sunday withdrew 
his highly publicized challenge to a duel saying the newspaper 
publisher he accused of besmirching his reputation was not a worthy 
opponent 
saul claveria deputy police chief in san jose province said 
the publisher became ineligible to duel when he announced last week 
he would show up at the planned confrontation but not actually 
fight 
he who refuses to take up arms will not fight and his 
adversary would be a vulgar assassin and would lose the condition 
of honorable duelist said claveria through his attorney ariosto 
fernandez 
he is not worthy of the gentlemanly pursuit fernandez said 
the publisher federico fasano was advised of claverias 
decision sunday and said the matter has ended 
fasano is director of the small leftist daily la republica in 
montevideo claveria challenged fasano to a duel permitted by law 
in uruguay in a disagreement over a story in la republica 
the jan 24 investigative story on the smuggling of consumer 
merchandise reported that two cars involved in distributing 
contraband were registered to claveria 
claveria said the cars had belonged to the police department 
and that he had only signed legal papers connected to their sale 
months ago the vehicles apparently now belong to a car rental 
agency 
fasano claimed his reporters worked correctly and ethically 
in writing the smuggling story 
claveria challenged fasano to a duel and the challenge received 
heavy media coverage both in fasanos paper and others 
claveria retired from the montevideo police department after 
reaching the post of inspector one of the highest and accepted a 
new post in san jose 30 miles east of the capital 
dueling in this small south american nation is regulated by a 
1939 law that requires seconds or colleagues of the two men in a 
dispute to try to reach a solution failing that they must 
designate a threemember tribunal to arrange a duel site 
witnesses doctors and other details 
if a participant is killed in an encounter that meets all the 
rules the other duelist is exempt from punishment

space shuttl atlantis 
landed safely on a california desert runway sunday completing a 
secret military mission that included the launch of a 500 million 
spy satellite 
congratulations on a great flight guys and welcome back 
mission control communicator steve oswald said 
atlantis carrying a crew of five military men plunged through 
the earths atmosphere in a long fiery dive flashed over the 
california coastline north of los angeles and touched down at 
edwards air force base at 1008 am pst 
with mission commander john o creighton at the controls 
atlantis landed smoothly on a dry lakebed runway it rolled to a 
stop a minute and 15 seconds later on the center line ending a 
4day mission 
fiftyone minutes after the landing the astronauts stepped out 
of the shuttle into brilliant mojave desert sunshine shook hands 
with nasa officials and posed for nasa photographers a flight 
surgeon examined them briefly before they disembarked 
you can probably tell by the smiles on our faces we had a 
great time creighton a navy captain told a crowd of 100 nasa 
workers and friends going on to refer to the many delays before 
takeoff it was terrific flight when we finally got off the 
ground i think we accomplished something that was important for 
the country 
we had a good time doing it the space shuttle performed 
superbly and thats a tribute to all the hard work that a lot of 
you out there helped put in to make the challenger the ship that it 
is and will continue to be creighton said in an apparent 
mistaken reference to the shuttle challenger which blew up after 
liftoff jan 28 1986 killing all seven crew members 
the shuttle pilot air force col john casper added as one 
of the rookies on board i just say wow what a fantastic 
experience 
creighton casper and the other crew members air force col 
richard mullane marine lt col david hilmers and navy lt cmdr 
pierre thuot then boarded two jets for the flight back home to 
houston 
they arrived ellington field an air force base in houston 
about 745 pm cst 
as 40 mph winds kicked up dust nasa crews towed atlantis off 
the unpaved dry lakebed landing strip to prepare it for a piggyback 
jet ride to kennedy space center fla on saturday 
nasa spokeswoman lise malone said a preliminary inspection 
showed about 62 of atlantis heatshield tiles suffered dings 
but that the count likely would change monday 
atlantis returned to earth as a weather front packing high wind 
moved toward edwards air force base threatening unacceptable 
conditions for the touchdown 
but by landing time the wind had dropped to an acceptable level 
of 21 mph with gusts to 25 the temperature was 62 degrees 
the shuttles characteristic twin sonic booms reverberated over 
the desert as the spacecraft approached however unlike most 
previous missions police across a wide area of southern california 
said they received no reports that the booms were heard elsewhere 
indicating that the shuttle took an unusual path toward edwards 
while the shuttle was descending from orbit it experienced a 
pressure dip in a hydraulic system that controls flaps and 
steering the astronauts switched to backup systems later mission 
control said pressure was restored in the primary system 
the next shuttle flight is scheduled for april 12 when discovery 
is to begin a fiveday mission to deploy the 155 billion hubble 
space telescope 
a pentagonimposed blackout blocked public announcement of the 
mission activities and because of the secret nature of the 
mission the landing was closed to public spectators a few hundred 
invited guests however watched as the shuttle landed 
atlantis was launched wednesday from kennedy space center in 
florida after five delays four caused by weather 
nasa sources who spoke on agreement of anonymity said the 
atlantis astronauts deployed the spy satellite thursday the 
satellite sources said is capable of taking high resolution 
photographs and listening in on electronic communications all over 
the world 
atlantis was launched on a path that carries it over points on 
earth farther north and south than any previous space shuttle this 
enabled the astronauts to place the satellite in an orbit that will 
cover parts of the soviet union never before photographed by a 
shuttlelaunched spy satellite 
a network of amateur observers which includes posts in canada 
alaska and scotland reported saturday they had sighted atlantis 
and a satellite in separate oribts 
atlantis flight was the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth 
dedicated solely to the military

politicians and leaders of american jewish 
groups criticized both the soviet and us governments sunday in a 
plea for the immediate evacuation of jews who want to leave the 
soviet union 
the growth of antisemitism in the soviet union makes it more 
urgent than ever that the united states not throw roadblocks in the 
way of migration from the soviet union said us rep bill 
green rny at a news conference sponsored by the zionist 
organization of america 
secretary of state james a baker iii suggested in washington 
last week that us aid to israel for housing of soviet jewish 
immigrants be linked to assurances that new settlements wont be 
built in the occupied territories 
green called the proposal offensive 
does the united states really take the position there are 
areas in the world in which no jews should be allowed to live he 
said 
israel maintains it doesnt have a policy of settling jewish 
immigrants in the occupied territories and says that of 12000 
soviet jews who came to israel last year only 200 have settled in 
the west bank or gaza strip 
although much of the governmentsponsored antisemitism has 
disappeared in the five years of mikhail gorbachevs rule his 
reforms also have unleashed grassroots antisemitism in the soviet 
union 
alexander matlin vice president of the american association of 
russian jews said his group has received thousands of telephone 
calls letters and eyewitness reports of threats and attacks 
against jews 
today most jews are leaving the soviet union not for 
political or religious freedom but simply out of fear he said 
he and other speakers called on the soviet union to honor a 
december agreement to allow direct flights to israel to allow for 
more emigration 
the soviets facing strong protests from the arab world over the 
influx to israel have so far refused 
rep ted weiss dny said gorbachev should take steps to stop 
rising antisemitism if he wants ussoviet relations to continue 
to improve 
it would be a mistake to allow a situation to fester which 
would make relations worse weiss said

some striking greyhound lines inc workers stayed off the picket 
line sunday in memory of coworker killed while picketing and a 
federal official said fewer small companies than expected had 
applied to temporarily take greyhound routes 
glenn eady regional compliance officer for the us interstate 
commerce commission in philadelphia said an icc board approved 
four temporary applications saturday for bus companies in the 
eastern region the region includes 23 states from maine to 
florida but none of the companies serves points south of virginia 
he said 
the response is not what we expected eady said sunday 
icc offices in chicago and san francisco also stayed open during 
the weekend to handle applications 
when the strike by the amalgamated council of greyhound local 
unions began friday it initially stranded thousands of passengers 
but the company brought in temporary drivers and greyhound chairman 
fred g currey claimed the company kept 25 percent of its routes 
running with the help of some union drivers crossing picket lines 
the company contends 350 union drivers have crossed picket lines 
to work but union president edward m strait said sunday that a 
careful count by strikers turned up just 95 
we hope that greyhound management will soon realize that 
the only way they will be able to provide the traveling public with 
safe and affordable intercity bus transportation is by returning to 
the negotiationg table for goodfaith bargaining on a fair and 
equitable contract strait said 
the union which represents more than 9000 employees went on 
strike after negotiators in scottsdale ariz failed to reach 
agreement on wage issues the strikers include the companys 6300 
drivers 
on sunday some strikers in washington state stayed off the 
picket lines in honor of robert waterhouse 59 a union member who 
was killed on a picket line saturday in redding calif waterhouse 
was crushed against a building by a bus driven by a driver hired as 
a temporary replacement 
greyhounds currey said he was told the driver was trying to 
maneuver around a pickup truck driven by a striker 
the replacement driver theodore graham left the scene he told 
investigators later that he hadnt realized he hit anyone 
according to a statement released sunday by the redding police 
department 
pickets trying to slow the bus yelled at the driver and hit the 
bus with their signs as it pulled away from the terminal and the 
bus had a minor crash with a strikers pickup truck on the way out 
police said he later flagged down a highway patrol car to report 
the minor crash and was taken in for questioning about the 
strikers death police said 
no charges were filed and police referred the case to the 
district attorney for a final determination 
we dont believe that he intentionally ran over this person 
redding police investigator john severson said saturday 
the victim was preparing to retire this year said his wife 
dorie waterhouse 
it really wasnt even his strike mrs waterhouse said 
but he was in there in support of his fellow drivers he kept 
saying its a matter of self pride 
striking drivers in olympia wash said they would cancel 
picketing sunday to observe a day of mourning for waterhouse 
in addition to the death there have been a few violent 
incidents including shots fired at a bus in chicago on friday 
in philadelphia police said a greyhound passenger awaited 
arraignment sunday on a charge of simple assault for allegedly 
spraying a striker with a pocket tear gas canister officer al 
tenuto said the passenger got in an argument with a striking driver 
after getting off a bus 
in jacksonville fla a striking greyhound driver was struck by 
a bus saturday but was uninjured the driver donald d white a 
27year greyhound veteran told police the slowmoving bus didnt 
stop as he walked across the street 
i was more mad that hurt said white 
in spokane wash charter drivers found panels torn open and 
electrical wires cut when they went to start their buses sunday 
morning said greyhounds area manager mike ford they were unable 
to start the buses which werent intended for use on scheduled 
greyhound runs 
currey said the company had asked federal courts in five cities 
to issue restraining orders against strikes violence 
currey led an investment group that paid 270 million for 
greyhound in 1987 then bought trailways lines inc four months 
later for 80 million 
before that buyout the drivers union agreed to a 22 percent 
wage cut but currey said greyhound drivers remain the highest paid 
in the industry

andy rooney returned sunday to 60 minutes 
after a threeweek suspension saying he was worried hed be 
wrongly remembered as a racist for remarks he says he didnt make 
rooney was suspended by cbs without pay feb 8 but reinstated 
three weeks later 
back at his usual showending slot rooney said it was demeaning 
to defend himself because he had a long history of supporting civil 
rights he said he didnt know how to apologize to homosexuals for 
a comment he made last year that he hadnt realized would be 
offensive 
staying at home made him worry about his legacy he said 
id be known for the rest of my life as a racist bigot and as 
someone who had made life a little more difficult for homosexuals 
i felt terrible and ive learned a lot the 71yearold rooney 
said 
what do i say to defend myself do i say im not a racist 
that sounds like saying im not a crook 
how do i apologize to homosexuals for hurting them with a 
remark i made that i didnt realize would hurt them 
cbs news president david burke suspended rooney after the 
advocate a gay magazine quoted him as saying that blacks had 
watered down their genes because the least intelligent among 
them had the most children burke never publicly gave a reason for 
the suspension 
rooney has denied making the remark 
at the time of the interview rooney was being criticized by 
homosexuals for his cbs special on dec 26 in which he cited 
homosexual unions among a list of things that cause 
selfinduced death he also drew criticism for a letter to the 
advocate in which he said he found male homosexual acts 
repugnant 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
last week said it was satisfied that the remarks attributed to 
rooney were distorted and didnt reflect his views the group 
declined to comment on sundays broadcast 
craig davidson executive director of the gay and lesbian 
alliance against defamation applauded rooneys comments on the 
show sunday 
mr rooneys anecdotal remarks contain an acknowledgement that 
his statements about gay people were unfair and harmful davidson 
said that is what glaad has sought all along and we welcome it 
roy brunett a spokesman for cbs news said the network would 
not know how many calls it received about the broadcast until 
monday 
burke last week reinstated rooney whose wry commentary had 
ended most each 60 minutes broadcasts since 1978 
rooney began his commentary by reciting a portion of a poem he 
remembered from high school in which the writer laments the loss of 
his true love not working for three weeks since his suspension he 
said was like losing his true love 
in his typical biting style he reiterated that he has opinions 
that will continue to upset some people thats what im here 
for he said while also questioning why he had become embroiled 
in controversy 
in 1970 i wrote the show called harry and lena for harry 
belafonte and lena horne i like lena better than harry does that 
make me a feminist 
on sunday rooney cited several examples which he said showed he 
wasnt racist including the night he threw out a house guest for 
using the word nigger 
id feel the same today if anyone used an insulting word about 
homosexuals he said 
rooney said he was overwhelmed by the calls and letters of 
support he had received following his suspension 
what do i do about the kind words heaped on me by friends and 
strangers how do i live up to such praise lets face it even 
on the nights when im good im not that good 
during his absence the program while still high in the 
ratings dropped in the standings to 18th place last sunday when it 
was beaten by a special rerun of abcs hit americas funniest 
home videos

thousands of ethnic turks and bulgarian 
moslems gathered sunday to press for legislation restoring the 
names they were forced to change in a sometimes violent 
assimilation drive 
participants also threatened a general strike in areas populated 
by bulgarias 15 million moslems to back demands for a swift 
change of names 
later in the day thousands of demonstrators ignored pleas from 
ethnic leaders to move from the downtown area a government 
spokesman demanded that the protesters go home 
the vigil around the alexander nevski cathedral and nearby 
parliament building came on the eve of a parliamentary session 
expected to enact a law giving moslems some rights to their 
original names 
protesters criticized the draft law saying it contained 
legalistic and bureaucratic hurdles that would slow the procedure 
in a campaign marked by violence ethnic turks were forced under 
communist leader todor zhivkov to change their first names and 
family names to bulgariansounding ones they also were prohibited 
from speaking their mother tongue or practicing the moslem religion 
last year about 320000 turks immigrated to neighboring turkey 
when zhivkov permitted them to get passports more than half have 
since returned 
after zhivkovs ouster in november the new leaders blamed him 
for the assimilation drive and in january decided to allow the 
turks to reclaim their former names and gave them greater religious 
freedom 
but no legislation to that effect has been adopted 
buses from around bulgaria sunday brought protesters to the 
capital 
ahmed doan an ethnic turkish leader later urged the protesters 
through a police megaphone to leave the square near the parliament 
building and go to a park in the southern part of the city all 
our demands are accepted at this stage he told the crowd if 
you stay here we are going to hamper adoption of our demands 
fearing counterdemonstrations doan and two other turkish 
activists also appealed to demonstrators on state television to 
avoid further tension 
interior ministry spokesman yordan ormankov also in a televised 
statement condemned groups who exert pressure on parliament 
and told demonstrators to go home however as night fell about 
2000 demonstrators were still gathered at the cathedral 
demonstrators told reporters they were angered by reports that 
under the proposed new law moslems still would have to have 
surnames with the bulgarian endings ev or ov and would 
have to request the name change in a lengthy court procedure 
we want our names and no name change in court read 
placards held by demonstrators who said they would not leave until 
their demands were met 
if we have to go to court to get our names back we would have 
to wait at least 20 years shouted a woman from velingrad in the 
rhodope mountains 
a factory worker in his late 50s said we will stay put we 
have left our homes and factories and tomorrow all the moslems 
will start a general strike 
doan who heads the nationwide movement for rights and freedom 
said he received assurances from government leaders the 
controversial legislation would be scrapped 
he said that in a meeting friday president petar mladenov 
premier andrei lukanov and national assembly chairman stanko 
todorov guaranteed there will be short procedures under the new 
law

blacks indicate to the rest of the population in the country that 
they have the capability to teach and serve 
the gift was formally announced at a ceremony on the golf course 
of annenbergs estate a 205acre desert oasis of manicured lawns 
duck ponds and sculpted shrubs set against snowcapped mountains

opportunity so as to get into the mainstream of economic affairs of 
the country 
when a reporter asked annenberg to explain his remark about

a senior iranian envoy met sunday with 
syrias foreign minister and discussed efforts to free western 
hostages held in lebanon an informed source said 
the syrian source who refused to be identified further said 
the meeting between mahmoud hashemi of iran and farouk alsharaa of 
syria appears to be to coordinate efforts between the governments 
of syria and iran to gain the release of all the hostages held by 
proiranian shiite moslem militants in lebanon 
syria irans main arab ally has been instrumental in helping 
release western hostages in the past it has 40000 troops deployed 
in much of lebanon 
joe reap a state department spokesman said of the sources 
reports on the hostages this is the first ive heard of the 
latest rumors 
also sunday vice president dan quayle denied reports in a 
british newspaper that talks have taken place between iranian 
officials and former us government officials including former 
secretary of state cyrus vance on the release of the hostages 
the syrian source said hashemi the brother of iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani delivered a very cordial message to sharaa 
from iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati including an 
invitation for him to visit tehran to meet with rafsanjani and 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
the source gave no other details of hashemis trip to lebanon or 
the onehour meeting with sharaa 
but another source noted this appears to be a serious effort 
the first in some time to end the hostage ordeal but i dont 
think well see anyone out tomorrow 
nobody can be precise about how long the process will take 
there appears to be a genuine desire by the iranian president to 
end this ordeal but there are still difficulties said the 
source 
earlier the official syrian arab news agency reported that 
hashemis talks with sharaa attended by iranian ambassador hasan 
akhtari centered on bilateral relations and issues of common 
interest 
hashemi is director of the tehran foreign ministrys third 
department which handles irans relations with syria lebanon and 
some other arab states 
he is a former senior iranian diplomat in damascus and former 
ambassador to belgium 
rafsanjani elected president last july has often used him as 
his personal emissary on sensitive missions abroad 
sharaa told peggy say sister of american hostage terry 
anderson in damascus last month that he planned to raise the issue 
of iranian help to free the western captives held in lebanon next 
time he visited tehran 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld of the 18 western hostages in lebanon 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
most of the hostages who include eight americans are believed 
held by shiite moslem groups loyal to iran 
in addition to the americans there are four britons two swiss 
two west germans an italian and an irishman held hostage 
the latest report follows a spate of statements from iranian 
newspapers and officials in recent days saying the hostages should 
be released because they are fueling propaganda against iran 
a london newspaper reported sunday that a delegation of iranian 
officials had arrived in beirut on a mission to free one or more of 
the hostagesthe independent on sunday said its information came 
from unidentified lebanese and iranian exiles in london and paris 
the independent also reported that talks had taken place in 
muscat oman ankara turkey and geneva between iranian officials 
and former us government officials including vance on the 
hostages 
quayle said on cbss face the nation that the bush 
administration is not using anyone to sit down and to negotiate 
on a quid pro quo basis with iran regarding release of the 
hostages 
asked about vance who was secretary of state under president 
jimmy carter quayle said we are not using cyrus vance to 
negotiate for the release of the hostages 
and im not going to say anything that is going to get 
expectations up once again weve been through that so many times 
and im just saying once and for all the president obviously wants 
them out he thinks that they should be released quayle said 
the independent said the iranian team sent to beirut was 
dispatched by rafsanjani one of the socalled pragmatists in iran 
who want to repair damaged relations with the west 
but rafsanjani is opposed in the iranian leadership by 
antiwestern radicals led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi and that rift is mirrored in the proiranian group 
hezbollah believed to be the umbrella for hostageholding factions 
one of the syrian sources noted lets not forget that 
rafsanjani still faces quite a bit of opposition 
rafsanjani doesnt look like he has the leverage with the 
people who count the hostageholders themselves he added

a phony bomb discovered at a synagogue during a 
weekend bat mitzvah has troubled jewish leaders and brought back 
memories of a bombing there three decades ago 
the temple on atlantas peachtree street and featured in the 
current movie driving miss daisy was evacuated saturday 
morning during a bat mitzvah service for a 12yearold girl 
a bogus bomb containing wires a clock and batteries as well 
as some confusing messages was left in the temples front 
doorway under a hebrew inscription proclaiming the temple a 
house of prayer for all peoples 
that inscription is a sign of welcome inclusiveness not 
hatred said rabbi alvin m sugarman the phony bomb he said 
had the effect of hatred 
im amazed at this said william b schwartz who was 
president of the temple in 1958 when the building was heavily 
damaged in a predawn bombing i thought we had come a long way 
over the years 
whoever left this weekends phony bomb wanted us to believe it 
was a bomb said atlanta police sgt wh briley he made it to 
look like a bomb 
the package according to police also contained videotapes of 
news reports about antiabortion protests and several messages 
including some referring to coretta scott king widow of civil 
rights leader martin luther king jr former first lady rosalynn 
carter and a local tv anchorwoman the messages werent 
antisemitic or racial threats said police capt jr spence 
there were several messages that made no sense he said 
the temple atlantas largest reform congregation with 5000 
members at present was bombed sunday morning oct 12 1958 
police estimated that 30 to 50 sticks of dynamite were set off just 
outside an entrance and a 20foot hole was blown in the building 
no one was hurt 
president eisenhower ordered fbi director j edgar hoover to 
assist atlanta police in investigating and five men were arrested 
but none was convicted 
the bomb was intended to quiet clergy support for atlanta school 
integration efforts at a time of racial tension but it had just 
the opposite effect said mark r jacobsen present director of the 
temple 
people referred to the bomb as something that unified the 
atlanta community jacobsen recalled the christian community 
and the black community all rallied to the temples side to help 
rebuild it the message of love prevailed 
atlanta constitution editor ralph mcgill won a pulitzer prize 
for a column about the bombing condeming those socalled 
christian ministers who have chosen to preach hate instead of 
compassion 
the bombing is depicted in the driving miss daisy a movie 
about an older atlanta jewish womans friendship with her black 
chauffeur 
about 150 people were evacuated from the temple saturday as 
12yearold pam epstein was reading from the torah during her bat 
mitzvah i thought i was going to cry because i wanted this to 
be very special she said 
but the ceremony concluded with a kiss from miss epsteins 
grandfather 
that was the amen to the prayer sugarman said what will 
endure here is not the act of hate but the beauty of a young woman 
accepting the adult role of a young jewish woman

theres not much puffing on us 
airliners these days and that has charles sleichter smiling 
sleichter president of advantage life products inc in the 
orange county community of laguna hills thinks the new federal 
regulation banning smoking on most domestic airline flights will 
boost sales of his companys smoking alternative 
if you look at all the smoking bans this one gives smokers no 
way out he said 
advantage is poised to capitalize on that 
it has planned a 4 million advertising campaign for later this 
year and is placing displays of its cigarrest chewing gum in 
airport gift shops along with the slogan help me make it 
through the flight 
the company has not had much success in trying to convince 
airlines to let flight attendants offer cigarrest to passengers 
undergoing nicotine withdrawal however 
because of industry officials concerns that passengers will 
smash sticky gobs of gum on plane seats sleichter said he is 
looking at the possibility of marketing the product in another 
form a throat lozenge 
the law passed by congress last year bans smoking on all flights 
within the united states except a few lasting six hours or longer 
to or from hawaii or alaska it went into effect feb 25 replacing 
an earlier smoking ban on domestic flights of two hours or less 
advantage isnt the only company involved in the 285 million 
stopsmoking industry that has thought about how the ban will 
affect business 
officials with dep corp the distributor of bantron 
stopsmoking pills said theyre trying to get airlines to offer 
their gum to passengers too 
schick laboratories the stopsmoking clinic chain is slashing 
fees and creating a television special to focus on the need to quit 
smoking in the wake of the ban company spokesman ed butler said 
but not everyone is capitalizing on the ban 
merrell dow inc the kansas citybased manufacturer of 
nicorette chewing gum said it has no plans for a major campaign 
i think there has been very little publicity and very little 
public controversy now that the ban is going into effect said 
john f banzhaf iii executive director of action on smoking and 
health in washington the group is an antismoking lobby 
i think the reality of it is that it has yet to hit the 
smokers banzhaf said but once it does i would expect that 
companies would capitalize on it

alaska airlines executives say they are 
encouraged by a preliminary agreement that could lead to the first 
scheduled air service to the soviet far east by the summer of 1991 
its definitely a market we think has a lot of potential and 
will and should open up doug versteeg vice president for 
administration said friday from his office in seattle 
we see tourism as the biggest component of the market 
tourists we bring to alaska already each season we think would be 
interested in extending their trip to the soviet far east 
us and soviet negotiators meeting in london on thursday 
announced an agreement in principle to open commercial air service 
between anchorage and the soviet far east cities of magadan and 
khabarovsk 
if a final agreement is reached alaska airlines hopes to offer 
two to three flights a week during the summer starting in 1991 
versteeg said it was too early to project how many people might 
take advantage of the planned service but he foresaw business 
people already traveling between the united states and the soviet 
union using the routes as well as tourists 
both countries want to do business he said 
gov steve cowper said the memorandum of consultation between 
the two countries could lead to regular air travel to other soviet 
cities by american carriers and service by the soviet carrier 
aeroflot to san francisco 
regular air service to the major cities in the soviet far east 
is the ticket to a permanent relationship with out soviet 
neighbors cowper said it means expanded trade opportunities 
easier cultural and educational exchanges and a greater 
understanding of our two systems 
talks are to resume in april to prepare a comprehensive 
ussoviet aviation agreement for inclusion in the planned june 
summit between president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
said dennis fradley an aide to sen frank murkowski ralaska 
alaska airlines has been working to establish the routes since 
january 1988 
alaska airlines made charter flights to the soviet far east in 
the 1970s and aeroflot sends periodic charter flights to the west 
coast but there has been no regularly scheduled air traffic 
between the two countries over the north pacific versteeg said 
bering air currently operates charter flights between nome and 
the soviet port city of provideniya 
magadan is a city of 160000 on the northern shore of the sea of 
okhotsk and khabarovsk has 600000 residents near the borders of 
north korea and china 
both are regional capitals as well as commercial centers 
khabarovsk is the eastern terminus of the transsiberian railroad
