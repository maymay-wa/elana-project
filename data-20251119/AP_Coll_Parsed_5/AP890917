outside of east berlin the 
countrys showcase capital east germans live in dreary and decaying 
cities where nagging shortages and chronic pollution aggravate a 
rigidly regulated life 
everywhere you look outside the city centers where most 
foreigners go the country is disintegrating its crumbling before 
your eyes said helmut lange a leipzig student who recently 
joined an exodus to the west 
although east germanys standard of living is the envy of its 
eastern european neighbors thousands are embarrassing the communist 
leadership by fleeing shortly before next months 40th anniversary 
celebrations 
many of them come from the provincial cities where life is the 
toughest and the harsh crackdown on diseen 100 years this month 
since a jury sentenced eight hatfield clan members to life in prison 
and ordered a ninth hanged for the slaying of five mccoys ending 
the bloodshed in which 10 to 20 people died 
but most participants died of old age the hatfields patriarch 
william anderson devil anse hatfield got religion and gained 
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83 his grave 
at sarah ann in logan county is marked by a towering italian marble 
sculpture of him the leader of the mccoys randolph old ranl 
mccoy embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children moved to 
town in pikeville ky dying in 1910 at age 85 
buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the 
heart of appalachia 
what is known is that the hatfields living mainly in what is now 
mingo county wva and the mccoys in pike county ky fought on 
and off for a dozen years in the regions wooded tangle of valleys 
and ridges 
some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the 
mccoys and ended up in a hatfield pen others say the dispute 
stemmed from the civil war in which this version goes the 
hatfields fought for the confederacy and the mccoys the union 
others say both families fought for the south 
romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between 
johnse hatfield and roseanna mccoy and that she eventually bore him 
a child out of wedlock 
in a 1988 book feud hatfields mccoys and social change in 
appalachia 18601900 author altina waller contends the feud was 
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on 
subsistence farming represented by the mccoys and the emergence of 
capitalism fueled by coal mining timber cutting and railroad 
interests in the hatfields region 
whatever the cause open warfare between the families began in 
1882 when devil anses brother ellison hatfield was stabbed two 
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in pike county 
the hatfields seized the three mccoys responsible and when ellison 
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed 
the feud escalated until new years day 1888 when the hatfields 
attacked the mccoy home in pike county burning it to the ground and 
killing two of old ranls children 
the governors of kentucky and west virginia became involved in a 
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the 
us supreme court 
now mcallisters organization is trying to find a way to 
commemorate the feud and the 1920 matewan massacre a downtown 
gunbattle between united mine workers sympathizers and coal company 
guards in which at least nine people died the incident was depicted 
in the 1987 movie matewan 
robert mccoy a former matewan mayor is among those who had to 
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud even though his branch 
of the family had economic ties to devil anse and never took part in 
the bloodshed 
not every mccoy or every hatfield participated in the 
shootouts mccoy said were directly related to the socalled 
feudists but we werent participants in the violent part of it 
but mccoy also is on the matewan development centers board of 
directors whose plans call for historic restoration downtown 
as a member of the family i probably get a little tired of it 
through the years ever since i was in high school it has been 
brought to my attention he said 
but as a community i think its one of our great hopes for 
economic survival here

if polands historic transition to 
democracy is to survive the new government must quickly solve some 
serious economic problems 
yet the dimensions and complexity of the crisis are so staggering 
that even solidaritys tadeusz mazowiecki the first noncommunist 
prime minister in the east bloc says society has no concept how 
difficult it will be to reform this economy 
how bad is it consider 
the value of the zloty currency continues to plummet as inflation 
soars at the end of june 4900 zloties bought a dollar last week 
it took 10000 
that means a man who receives 20 a month from an aunt in chicago 
gets more than a months average wage which was 122000 zlotys in 
july up from 55000 in january 
as a result workers by the score have walked away from their 
state jobs forcing shops to close mail to go undelivered and 
assembly lines to stall 
this years state budget envisioned a deficit equivalent to 989 
million at the official exchange rate but the government raised it 
to 49 billion in just seven months said economics professor jozef 
kaleta in the express wieczorny newspaper 
to span he gap the government issues more money nearly 45 
percent of the budget is being covered by the printing of banknotes 
according to a communist party report 
the list of basics available only with difficulty this week in 
warsaw includes flour cheese sugar razor blades matches washing 
powder and sanitary napkins 
the government survey of the mounting disequilibrium in the 
nonfood market listed as particularly painful shortages of 
clothing footwear furniture consumer electronics appliances 
refrigerators kitchenware radios sewing machines bicycles cars 
soap and shampoo 
i have two children and i literally live in front of this store 
for three weeks because my refrigerator broke down said a woman 
who at 1130 pm was in line outside a warsaw shop where a 
shipment of new appliances was expected some day she and other 
relatives took turns sleeping in a car 
the hopelessly inadequate telephone system has less than 3 
million telephones for 38 million people no direct connections to 
the united states and a tendency to cut off whole districts where 
numbers start with a certain digit 
polands 39 billion on foreign debt 1026 for every man woman 
and child is the fourth largest in the world after brazil mexico 
and argentina 
thirty percent of the government budget subsidizes goods and 
services according to a world bank report 
the cost of producing beef and veal is 50 percent subsidized 
according to the report such subsidies mean a farmer could find it 
cheaper to buy milk at a store than drink it from his own cows 
with the average price for coal covering only 53 percent of 
production costs supplies for the approaching winter are down 
dramatically for lack of government subsidies the state news agency 
pap warns other state industries cant pay for their coal 
outmoded inefficient factories should be closed but they employ 
huge work forces making up much of solidaritys membership and the 
critical housing shortage makes it difficult for displaced workers 
to move to new jobs 
the wait for a minuscule warsaw apartment is a decade or more 
but this year forecasters expect to complete 30000 housing units 
less than planned nationwide 
typical is a 20yearold high rise apartment house on dolna 
street in warsaw which has not had hot water for seven of the past 
11 months due to shoddy construction and lack of spare parts five 
older neighboring buildings are not equipped for hot water at all 
about 20 percent of university students emigrate gazeta wyborcza 
says 
doctors frequently prescribe medicines not available at 
pharmacies relying on patients to secure them in the west 
hospital stays require a supply of gifts to the staff to secure 
everything from clean sheets to anesthetics 
physicians and nurses are among the most underpaid of poles a 
remnant of the glorification of the laborer and are allowed private 
patients only after hours at government clinics 
a dual currency system has developed with the dollar used for 
most meaningful transactions coffee orange juice scotch 
televisions and apartments generally are available only for dollars 
most economic indicators are down according to the most recent 
government statistics industrial sales by 59 percent 
manufacturing sales by 6 percent june livestock procurement 25 
percent below june 1988 
harder to quantify but widely felt is a decline in the pride of 
craft as workers become demoralized 
the present state of services transportation communications 
and health care makes daily life extremely difficult forces 
people to break moral standards and accept humiliating treatment 
wrote stanislaw chelstowski in economic life newspaper 
the challenge is partly psychological mazowiecki says 
the most difficult task is to make people feel that it can be 
better although it cannot be better immediately he said 
a 21yearold teacher learning of mazowieckis election 
commented were so tired it doesnt really matter what happens 
on aug 1 the outgoing government took the first radical step 
lifting controls on almost all food prices although price increases 
of several hundred percent followed economists hope supplies will 
improve 
but a consensus is forming that even more painful and radical 
reforms are needed 
the economy is on its knees the pauperization of society 
advances almost from day to day so there is no time to look for some 
miraculous cures said kaleta

a powerful storm pelted parts of northern 
california on saturday causing power failures and a death by 
lightning and threatening the nations most valuable white wine 
grape harvest 
the storm knocked out electricity from king city 100 miles south 
of san jose to chico about 160 miles north of san francisco said 
pacific gas amp electric co spokesman ron rutkowski 
he said 200000 residents lost power beginning at 5 am mostly 
because of lightning strikes which are unusual in this part of the 
west service was restored in most areas after a few hours 
rutkowski said 
lightning struck and killed a man during a softball game in 
cotati about 40 miles north of san francisco police said 
a train that takes visitors on tours of the famed napa valley 
wine country made its inaugural ride despite being struck by 
lightning and suffering a power failure before leaving the station 
but growers in the area visited by the wine train said the rain 
threatened to cause rot or late maturity for pricey chardonnay and 
sauvignon blanc grapes that are nearly ready for harvest on 21000 
acres in napa and sonoma counties 
it all depends on what happens in the next three of four 
days said grower andrew beckstoffer weve got to get some wind 
and heat to dry things up but if we get humidity these grapes 
will rot 
he said as much as threequarters of the most expensive white 
grapes in the country worth 1800 a ton or more could be lost 
the rains could allow ruinous mold to form on the grapes or 
dilute the grape sugar delaying the maturation process and thereby 
putting the grapes at greater risk of being reached by the rot 
saidjerry luper winemaster at rutherford hill winery 
enologists say the 1989 white grapes of napa and sonoma counties 
have a potential to be a great vintage if the rain doesnt get to 
them first 
the red grapes tougher and thickerskinner than the whites are 
still on the vines and wont be harvested for weeks

sending her walking down the runway in the atlantic city convention 
center as host gary collins sang the pageant standard there she 
is 
this years contest became a platform for social issues for the 
first time each finalist was asked a question about the issue of 
her choice 
miss turner was asked how to best motivate americas youth 
you have to let them know they can do anything and then show 
them the way to do that she said 
the 5foot7 118pound contestant with dark brown hair and 
brown eyes won one of the three preliminary swimsuit competitions 
in which she wore a canary yellow swimsuit

missouricolumbia veterinary shool have given her the opportunity to 
treat everything from a 4dayold vietnamese potbellied piglet to 
a 2000pound hereford bull she said she collects surgery 
souvenirs such as puppy fetuses 
i just have a pure love for animals said miss turner who

gown with a rhinestone bodice the vneck gown featured a keyhole 
back

detail what she would like to advocate during her year as miss 
america 
miss turner a poised selfassured woman has said she wants to 
use her reign to motivate young students to strive higher 
im not naive she said before the pageant if i win miss 
america im not saying im going to change every youth if ive 
inspired one person to be an astronaut then id feel i made a 
difference 
she deflects criticisms that the pageant offers a chance only to 
white women 
the doors werent closed to me she said its open for any 
woman who is talented 
there have been two black miss americas miss america 1984 
vanessa williams however was dethroned after a mens magazine

interviews with judges 
all of this years contestants were asked by pageant officials to 
take a stand on the issue of their choice and the winner will be 
urged to promote her platform during her reign 
pageant director leonard horn said the idea of giving miss 
america a voice is one that might bring her more national respect 
he has stressed in the past several months that this is not just a 
beauty pageant

essay on the an issue they planned to promote during their years 
reign

hurricane hugo ripped away rooftops 
and uprooted trees in guadeloupe and dominica early sunday and 
approached other popular resort islands of the eastern caribbean 
with deadly winds of up to 140 mph 
forecasters described hugo as extremely dangerous and said it 
could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since 
hurricane david in 1979 that storm killed an estimated 1200 people 
in the caribbean and florida 
the eye of the hurricane is directly above guadeloupe israel 
matos director of the national weather service bureau in san juan 
said sunday at 125 am edt it was impossible to telephone to 
guadeloupe early sunday morning as telephone circuits were either 
jammed or busy 
at midnight edt saturday hugos center was near 163 north 
latitude and 611 west longitude about 350 miles eastsoutheast of 
san juan after hitting the french island it was expected to move 
north toward puerto rico said forecaster martin nelson at the 
national hurricane center near miami 
the hurricane was moving westnorthwest at 12 mph sending 
showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the caribbean and 
threatening islands over a 600mile arc stretching from st lucia to 
puerto rico 
the storms effects would start to be felt in the virgin islands 
and puerto rico by sunday morning the national weather service in 
san juan said 
by midnight there was a blackout in most of guadeloupe as 
authorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure 
government radio rfo said the island experienced very strong winds 
which blew the metal roofing off some homes on guadeloupes eastern 
side late saturday night 
in dominica to the south there were power outages on the islands 
north side where strong winds uprooted trees the radio said 
radio france internationale from paris monitored in san juan 
shortly before midnight saturday said french authorities were 
preparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to guadeloupe 
its a very dangerous storm extremely dangerous in fact 
nelson said 
forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly course 
it would pass over st croix in the us virgin islands about 6 pm 
sunday and continue on to the northeastern coast of puerto rico 
early monday san juan the puerto rican capital with a population 
of 11 million is on the northeastern coast 
earlier forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for puerto 
ricos southern coast 
the national weather service in miami issued hurricane warnings 
at 3 pm edt for the us virgin islands and for puerto rico which 
previously had been on a hurricane watch the warnings were posted 
from martinique northward and westward through puerto rico 
including the british virgin islands and st martin and surrounding 
islands 
tropical storm watches for the islands of barbados and st 
vincent were discontinued and a warning for st lucia was changed 
to a tropical storm watch 
forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expected 
near the eye of hugo and warned of heavy rain and flooding 
in guadeloupe and dominica the first two islands directly in 
hugos path civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people to 
rescue shelters 
franklin mcdonald head of the pancaribbean disaster 
preparedness and prevention project in antigua said several relief 
teams from the united states already were headed to the region 
state radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide early 
saturday on dominicas isolated southeast side which faces the 
atlantic partly blocking a road but causing no injuries the public 
works department deployed earthmoving equipment at strategic points 
across the island 
noncritically ill patients at princess margaret hospital in the 
capital of roseau were sent home late friday and early saturday to 
make room for possible hurricane victims 
the government of dominica urged its citizens via radio to take 
emergency precautions and said police were put on alert to deal 
with any security problem which might arise there was widespread 
looting after hurricane david battered the tiny island of 81000 
people 
in guadeloupe which has a population of 340000 heavy traffic 
built up in pointeapitre the biggest city late friday as people 
rushed supermarkets and hardware stores stocking up on food 
bottled water and supplies such as flashlights batteries timber 
nails and tape 
the government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off the 
streets by 6 pm in what amounted to a curfew the directions were 
broadcast on radio stations 
residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many on 
the atlantic side fled inland 
at le meridien a luxury 271room beachfront hotel in st 
francois a woman who answered the telephone said guests were being 
moved from groundfloor rooms and those facing the ocean but she 
said none of the 100 guests had checked out 
many people are worried nobodys hysterical said the hotel 
employee who asked not to be identified by name 
in paris air france canceled all three of its flights scheduled 
saturday to guadeloupes sister island martinique and british 
airways canceled its flight from london to antigua where the 
airport was closed 
officials in puerto rico said up to 6000 people might have to be 
evacuated from floodprone areas if hugo passes near the densely 
populated island of 33 million 
hugo is the eighth named storm of the current atlantic hurricane 
season which runs from june 1 to nov 30

growing up in americas most famous 
political family did not prepare patrick j kennedy for the ways of 
the rhode island general assembly 
the political education of sen edward kennedys younger son 
began last year when he challenged a 10year incumbent in the 
democratic primary for a state house seat from northwest providence 
it continued when he got to the statehouse and learned what it 
really takes to pass a bill 
kennedy 22 was no ordinary freshman then a junior and now a 
senior at providence college he spent 87694 or 66 per vote a 
record for a state legislative race for a job that pays 300 a 
year all but 5904 of that was his own money 
then kennedy hired a staff aide and opened an office in his 
district his predecessor like most general assembly members had 
operated alone using space in his house and his funeral home 
but despite his familys wealth and prominence kennedy soon 
found his bills treated the same as everyone elses in a house 
where observers like the group common cause say the speakers word 
is law 
several of kennedys major initiatives including a bill to 
require rhode island automobiles to adhere to california emissions 
standards never got out of the committee he sits on health 
education and welfare 
i talked to most of the members of the committee and it was 
clear to me that we had a majority to pass that kennedy said i 
was told to go speak to the leadership and i went to speak to 
majority leader tom lamb and he said well we have to look into 
this more and it was tabled 
and i asked around what did this mean and people said 
well thats tantamount to letting a bill die quietly 
the committees chairman democrat frank j fiorenzano said 
kennedys family background should have prepared him for his 
legislative losses 
maybe hes disappointed that things didnt move as fast as he 
wanted them to but he shouldnt have been taken aback fiorenzano 
said ive submitted some pieces of legislation every year since 
ive been elected and they still havent been passed 
kennedy said his fathers life in the us senate was nothing 
like the routine of the rhode island statehouse 
my father has had to come to compromise hes had to work 
on things with other colleagues and hes had to agree and 
disagree kennedy said thats the way the legislative process 
is supposed to work and that can still work without it being a 
system where the shots are called without any compromise or 
agreement 
the rev h philip west jr director of the rhode island chapter 
of common cause a legislative watchdog group agreed that power is 
highly centralized in the state house so much seems to happen 
here by the decision from the speakers office he said 
kennedy said he plans to seek reelection despite his frustration 
with the system and already is busy deflecting attacks from 
republicans the gop did not run anyone against him last year but 
since then has criticized kennedy repeatedly for raising thousands 
of dollars from outofstate sources 
where i receive my contributions has no bearing whatsoever on my 
voting i thought it was offensive that they implied that people in 
this neighborhood had their votes for sale he said after a 
certain point the amount of money you spend in a local race is 
ineffective because people have to meet you 
house leaders said kennedy has been as effective as any freshman 
legislator and could have a bright future if he remains in the house 
speaker joseph deangelis said he never had asked for kennedys 
vote on any particular bill but on those issues that were party 
issues he has always been a democrat 
fiorenzano praised kennedys devotion to the job 
everyone when you first get up there thinks theyre going to 
change the world fiorenzano said then you learn not everyone 
shares your view and you have to work with other people to reach 
compromises on your issues

the idea of deploying americas military forces 
on the nations streets to battle the scourge of drugs may be fodder 
for headlines and congressional demands but pentagon officials 
point out there are strict legal limitations on such a thing 
it just makes hair stand on end here said one senior 
pentagon official our primary mission is to prepare for any 
possible military threat not to be a national police force 
theres been a lot of very loose talk about expanding our role 
to counter assumptions that us troops could be used to patrol 
the streets and nab drug dealers pentagon officials point to a 
littleknown law that prevents active duty troops from acting as law 
enforcement officers within the nations borders 
it is known as the posse comitatus act and was passed by congress 
in 1878 as a postcivil war reaction to the use of federal troops in 
enforcing the reconstruction acts 
because it deals with the enforcement of domestic law the law 
does not affect us forces overseas 
david super a defense department spokesman said that while it 
may be enticing to think of the nations military might as a machine 
to be turned against drug king pins the ramifications have to be 
taken into account 
its really a rather profound idea when you think about it 
he said posse comitatus is a reflection on our free society 
there are a lot of countries where the military is used to police 
the streets but they arent much fun to live in 
according to a common legal definition the term posse 
comitatus means the power of the county and refers to the 
authority of the sheriff to call to his aid the male population 
above the age of 15 to in capturing escaped felons and keeping the 
peace 
in effect the law is interpreted to mean that military forces 
the army air force navy and marines and their respective reserves 
may be used in a support role for the battle against drugs such 
as aiding in surveillance or interdiction efforts 
but they are prevented from adopting the role of law enforcement 
officials tasks assigned to the local police or other officials 
such as from the drug enforcement agency 
for example the military may provide boats to help interdict 
drug traffickers or radar surveillance to spot a drugtransporting 
plane but it is up to civilian law enforcement officials to seize 
evidence make arrests and testify in court 
the law does not affect a states national guard when units are 
under the control of its governor but the laws in each state vary 
said robert dunlap a spokesman for the national guard bureau 
the national guard bureau is the defense department agency that 
serves as a coordinating body for the guard forces in the various 
states 
it is national guard bureau policy that its members not be 
tasked with enforcing civil law officials point out 
its important because we just dont have the training were 
not trained to do police work dunlap said 
dunlap said guard units have been involved in helping local 
officials support drug interdiction efforts since 1977 and since 
1983 has been involved on the federal level 
in fact the role of the guard has been expanded in 21 states to 
allow them to aid customs officials in cargo inspections for illicit 
drugs super said 
guardsmen are happy to be involved guardsmen are all 
volunteers and part of the community they serve but our proper role 
is in support of civilian law enforcement officials dunlap said 
congress has been pressing the pentagon to become more active on 
the home front in the war against drugs despite concerns among the 
military brass about draining resources from their traditional 
defense mission 
defense secretary dick cheney is slated to outlined an expanded 
military role this week the secretarys plan is not expected to 
call for an enforcement role for the military but rather emphasize 
increased interdiction and radar surveillance methods among other 
things

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani said 
sunday that if iraq does not relinquish iranian territory it seized 
in the last days of the persian gulf war his country will make it 
retreat by force 
it was the toughest statement made by an iranian leader since a 
ceasefire in the eightyear war took effect aug 20 1988 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
nicosia quoted rafsanjani as telling commanders of irans 
revolutionary guards we have no territorial ambitions but we 
will not cede one inch of our islamic land 
rafsanjani did not give iraq a deadline but said we will be 
patient as far as possible his comments to commanders of the 
paramilitary revolutionary guards were carried by the official 
islamic republic news agency in a report monitored in nicosia 
it will be very easy for us to regain our land said 
rafsanjani who was elected july 28 he made clear iran will not 
make any concessions to break a deadlock in peace talks that began 
more than a year ago 
the iranians insist there can be no advance in the talks until 
the iraqis withdraw from iranian soil 
iran claims the iraqis hold 1028 square miles of iranian border 
territory un observers say the iraqis hold 386 square miles 
the land was captured in a series of iraqi offensives shortly 
before the ceasefire took effect 
those military setbacks were a key factor in forcing tehran to 
accept the un ceasefire resolution 
iran is not seeking any illogical concession from iraq just as 
it will not make any concessions to the enemy even if the present 
situation lasts 10 years rafsanjani said at the revolutionary 
guards commanders annual conference in tehran 
if one day we become certain that the enemy is not willing to 
return our land we will make it retreat by force he declared 
rafsanjani said iran has no desire to resume the war which by 
western military estimates killed more than 1 million people iran 
was believed to have suffered losses three times as heavy as iraq 
in addition to the land issue the peace talks are stalled over 
disagreements concerning the shattalarab waterway the southern 
boundary between the nations 
iraq is demanding that iran allow the waterway iraqs main 
outlet to the persian gulf to be dredged and reopened iran 
refuses 
in addition iraq does not recognize a 1975 treaty that drew the 
iraniraq border down the center of the waterway before that 
treaty the border ran down the iranian bank of the shattalarab 
iran says the 1975 treaty is valid 
rafsanjani said iran will not back down on the shattalarab 
we will repel the enemy to the borders defined in the 1975 
accord he said 
before rafsanjani spoke irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei told commanders their forces and the regular army must be 
in a state of constant combat readiness 
but he noted we are determined to achieve peace within the 
framework of the un security council resolution and we will never 
initiate a step to weaken it 
the last session of peace talks was held in april under un 
auspices

chinas violent crackdown on demonstrators for 
democracy is sharply cutting tourism and private investment and 
contributing to troubles that will keep the chinese from matching 
last years 112 percent economic growth rate world bank officials 
say 
china the worlds most populous country will need to deal 
with the economic consequences of political problems this past 
summer said the banks vice president for asia attila 
karaosmanoglu 
these problems include a sharp downturn in tourism and a 
significant reduction in private investment he told reporters at 
a briefing on the banks annual report released sunday 
china is enjoying a strong year in agriculture which will 
reduce the need for food imports but the growth rate can be 
expected to decline as chinese leaders pursue measures to cool the 
economy and reduce inflation karaosmanoglu said 
he declined to guess how far it would drop under 112 percent 
for china the most difficult part of the reform process lies 
ahead said the annual report the stunning economic results of 
promoting private enterprise in agriculture and decentralizing 
decisionmaking in urban enterprises have brought with them more 
fundamental problems 
while the rising tempo of economic activity has raised the 
living standards of the broad mass of population and served to keep 
alive grassroots support for chinas reform program it said 
such high rates of growth have clearly pushed the economy to the 
limits of its productive capacity 
the world bank reduced its anticipated fiscal 1989 lending to 
china by 780 million to 13 billion karaosmanoglu said because 
action by its board on seven projects was postponed last june 
following the events in beijing 
postponement was ordered in consultation with chinese 
authorities he said adding that we hope we can return to china 
in the near future we fully intend to keep the door open 
but he said there is no timetable for reviving the postponed 
projects 
world bank programs in china include development efforts in 
remote deprived areas where the report noted an estimated 70 
million people live in conditions of absolute poverty

songs written 6000 years ago and deciphered 
from stone tablets will waft through this fabled city on friday as 
babylon relives the ancient days when it was the center of 
civilization 
tens of thousands of people are expected at the huge cultural 
extravaganza planned in babylon which is about 55 miles south of 
baghdad 
the city was rebuilt by president saddam hussein at a cost of 
about 100 million in an ambitious program to revive the splendors 
of the past and to build a tourist industry folowing the eightyear 
persian gulf war 
for two weeks babylons reconstructed palaces and temples will 
echo with music opera dance and drama performed by troupes from 
the united states the soviet union japan and 35 other countries 
the focuses of the festival will be the 2500seat greek 
amphitheater built in the 4th century bc by alexander the great 
who died in babylon and the crown hall in the palace of 
nebuchadnezzar ii who ruled in the 6th century bc 
babylon was the center of the worlds civilization arts and 
culture and it is right that it regain that fame again said munir 
bashir chief director of the festival 
the first festival was held here in 1987 when iran and iraq were 
at war last years festival was held just a month after the 
hostilities ceased under a unbrokered truce 
an estimated 100000 people flocked to babylon for last years 
festival which featured artists from 24 countries including 
brazilian guitarist maria liva sao marcos the american jeff gardner 
jazz quartet the leningrad ballet and the glamos folk group from 
norway 
only a handful of europeans and americans attended but the 
iraqis expect more this year 
now that the wars over we expect many more people bashir 
said 
a highlight he said will be an iraqi troupes presentation of 
songs dance and music based on ancient babylonian music 
the ancient music was played primarily on harps some of which 
have been found in the ruins of the city on the banks of the 
euphrates river 
bashir and other iraqi researchers spent months unraveling the 
notations on stone tablets to reproduce the primitive tunes which 
will be performed in public for the first time in millenia 
bashir 59 is director of music at the ministry of information 
and culture and is the worlds most renowned virtuoso of the oud an 
arabic stringed instrument that was the forebear of the lute 
the iraqis claim that the ancient land known as mesopotamia or 
land between the rivers the euphrates and tigris was the 
cradle of civilization it is also the reputed site of the 
garden of eden 
the babylonians ruled an empire that flourished as a cultural 
religious and commercial center for hundreds of years the legal and 
social codes they developed were the first to provide for individual 
and family rights and have influenced modern legal systems 
thousands of iraqi sudanese and egyptian laborers have toiled in 
the blistering heat for the last few years to rebuild the 
54000square foot palace of nebuchadnezzar the temples of 
nabashkhari and ninmakh the processional way babylons main 
thoroughfare and the ishtar gate named after the babylonians main 
goddess

historians of the day 
in other attractions at the festival the soviet union will send 
an azerbaijani dance troupe the joyce trisslet dance troupe is 
coming from the united states

emigres 
critics charge the administrations response as presented this 
week on capitol hill after seven months of deliberations is 
inadequate unimaginative and risks missing a historic opportunity 
some say the us government could learn a thing or two from 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs open door policy 
the administration argues it is doing its best in the face of 
shrinking budgets and the problem of dealing with 14 million 
refugees worldwide many of whom would like to move to the united 
states 
of the 125000 refugee slots allocated for fiscal 1990 that 
starts oct 1 50000 will be reserved for soviet applicants most 
of whom are jews 
the administration predicts as many as 150000 soviet jews will 
apply for refugee status in fiscal 1990 jewish groups say as many 
as 500000 jews may seek to come here in the coming years if the 
doors remain open especially in light of rising antisemitism in 
the soviet union 
an internal state department report used by immigration and 
naturalization officers in moscow concluded that glasnost with its 
liberalized rights to free speech and press has spawned 
discrimination against jews throughout the soviet union 
religious groups and many on capitol hill also argue that 
gorbachevs reforms and his political future are by no means assured 
success and their failure could strand thousands of persecuted 
people wishing to leave 
soviet history has painfully demonstrated that lulls in 
government repression are usually followed by harsh oppression 
said a letter to congress from world relief which represents 
evangelical christians the evangelicals constitute a small 
percentage of those seeking to come here 
members of congress say if tight budgets are the problem keeping 
more soviets from coming to the united states creative 
financing should be considered 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio suggested the government help 
additional refugees by lending them money for their relocation 
which would be paid back once theyre settled 
when the faucets start opening the united states finds 
itself totally incapable of dealing with the very policy it is 
demanding said rep howard berman dcalif 
the administration agreed the united states is to some degree 
a victim of its own success said deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger 
but he argued that although the demand for liberalized soviet 
emigration was a cornerstone of us policy for nearly 20 years 
never was it said that the us has an obligation to take them all 
in 
he urged other countries like western european states australia 
and israel to share the burden 
israel may be the only clear beneficiary of the surge of 
emigration which could go a long way to beefing up the jewish 
population and countering a growing arab population domestically and 
in neighboring states israeli officials said privately this week 
that once soviet jews realize their entry to the united states was 
sharply restricted they might choose israel 
most jews and evangelicals who have left so far have done so on 
an israeli visa once they get to rome or vienna however all but 
10 percent or so shift direction for the united states 
this has created a backlog in rome and vienna expected to reach 
30000 by oct 1 some have been waiting for 18 months 
responding to growing pressure from congress the administration 
promised this week its first priority would be to clear up the 
backlog in italy and austria 
attorney general dick thornburgh in an effort to head off 
pending legislation that would automatically grant refugee status to 
all soviet applicants announced he had ordered a review of 5000 
cases of soviets in rome who have been denied refugee status 
once the backlog is cleared the vienna and rome centers which 
have cost the united states 34 million annually to maintain will 
be shut all processing will be handled in moscow with a new 
washington facility to help 
the administration is negotiating with the soviets to be allowed 
to increase its ins embassy staff from three to six officers 
starting oct 1 
lawmakers this week ridiculed this solution saying six 
adjudicators would barely make a dent in the wave of applications 
but noting that because the 1990 quota has already been used up by 
the backlogs in rome and moscow this would not matter much anyway

the nations new hightech weather radar system 
has passed its first test and is now headed for a detailed 
evaluation the national weather service announced sunday 
on a scale of 1100 the new radar scored a 91 at detecting 
severe storms in five months of tests at the air force operational 
test and evaluation center in norman okla 
by comparison the nations current weather radar system averaged 
only a 58 on the same types of tests the weather service reports 
nws director elbert w friday jr said he was pleased with the 
results in the tests of nexrad or next generation weather radar 
however he said more performance and reliability testing must be 
done before the system can be installed across the country 
nexrad will begin operational testing in the spring with the 
first system expected to become operational in july at twin lakes 
okla near oklahoma city according to friday 
by the mid1990s the new system is expected to go into service at 
165 locations across the nation the system will be used by the 
weather service federal aviation administration air force and navy 
in addition to improving the ability to forecast tornadoes 
thunderstorms hailstorms and damaging winds the new radars also had 
less than half as many false alarms as the current radar system 
the new radars use what is called doppler technology which 
allows the radar beam to detect not just the presence of rain and 
moisture in the air but also the speed and direction of winds 
radar sends out an electronic impulse and when part of that 
impulse bounces back the machine can determine the location of the 
object causing the reflection 
in the case of doppler radar it can also determine the movement 
of the reflecting item such as a tornado or thunderstorm 
in the tests the new radars were able to detect severe weather as 
far as 250 miles from the site of the equipment officials said

a sixblock area of waikiki beach is sinking 
splitting sidewalks tilting small buildings and making streets 
uneven but a building contractor has taken responsibility 
in order to excavate a blocksized area in the heart of the 
tourist mecca to a depth of 30 feet as part of a 50 million 
commercial project pacific construction co has been pumping up to 
7000 gallons of groundwater out of the hole every minute since may 
officials of pacific construction accepted responsibility and 
have had crews scrambling around to fill and patch the newest 
pavement cracks or gaps between sidewalks or sagging walls and 
buildings as soon as they are reported 
engineers and consultants who planned the project and city 
officials who approved the plans assumed there would be some soil 
settlement said the citys chief building inspector sadao 
kaneshiro 
the water table in the area is just 6 feet below the surface 
whenever you take out groundwater the surrounding areas will 
be affected kaneshiro said they knew that but its a matter 
of degree they didnt know how much 
in some places the subsidence has been as much as 4 inches 
pumping and officials hope the sinking will stop when 
construction reaches the fourthfloor level in about six weeks said 
trudie china pacific constructions marketing manager 
managers of neighboring buildings are pleased with pacific 
constructions response but dont like the nuisance and think the 
contractors and city should have anticipated the problem 
after all waikiki is built on a swamp and these guys are 
draining the swamp said john van apell building manager of the 
nearby royal kuhio condominium 
steve winter general manager of the waikiki joy hotel across 
the street from the hole said he is trying to take the problem in 
stride and cant give enough credit to pacific construction for 
trying to repair the damage 
kimberly line administrator of the 13story laniolu retirement 
home and care center said its not just the actual damage its 
the mental anguish the residents go through they ask me are we 
still safe is the building going to fall down 
willella reub a resident of laniolu said its a question of 
comfort her wheelchair rides hard over the bumps caused by the 
subsidence she said

the hungarian ambassador to the united states 
on sunday denied western speculation that the kremlin had given 
prior approval to his governments decision to open its borders to 
east germans fleeing to the west 
ambassador peter varkonyi told a television interviewer that i 
havent got strict information on the decision but that 
hungarian decisions are made in budapest the hungarian capital 
of course there is a diplomatic way of consultation and 
information but the decision was taken in budapest varkonyi said 
on the abctv program this week with david brinkley 
asked whether the decision had been made without reference to 
the soviet union the ambassador replied without any reference 
to the soviet union at all 
the washington post in an article from oslo norway published 
in its sunday editions quoted unidentified western officials saying 
that hungary consulted with the kremlin before allowing the east 
germans to leave 
and a former senior us government official said she believed 
the kremlin had approved the hungarian decision in advance 
rozanne l ridgway a former ambassador to east germany and 
assistant secretary of state for european affairs asked whether she 
thought moscow had given hungary the green light said i do think 
that is true 
the hungarian ambassador to washington said that although the 
flight of an estimated 14000 east germans across hungarian borders 
to the west had drawn criticism from the east german leadership his 
government did not plan to close the frontier 
to send them back against their will and without any provisions 
that they would be immune to any punishment and would have a legal 
opportunity to emigrate would have been not correct and we would 
like to comply with our international obligations on human rights 
he said 
multilateral agreements signed by western and soviet bloc nations 
explicitly say certain things about choice of emigration and 
nations that do sign but do not heed those pacts are in violation 
he said 
if they are not ensuring a choice of emigration it seems to be 
that it isnt complying with the international agreements we have 
signed varkonyi said 
two other guests on the abc program west german ambassador s 
juergen ruhfus and theo summer editor of the newspaper die zeit of 
hamburg predicted the east german government would be forced to 
drop its resistance to the types of political and economic reform 
underway in hungary poland the soviet union

china stepped up its campaign against the western 
press sunday reprinting a 65yearold commentary calling for the 
expulsion of all foreign reporters 
also sunday premier li peng told a japanese delegation that the 
government will not soon lift martial law in beijing because 
citizens seized many weapons from the army during the june crackdown 
on prodemocracy protesters 
the official beijing daily reprinted on its front page a 1924 
essay by li dazhao cofounder of the chinese communist party 
saying china was the victim of journalistic invasion 
the article applauded the expulsion of a british reporter who 
erroneously reported the death of sun yatsen the man regarded as 
the father of modern china sun died in 1925 
but li dazhao said expelling one reporter was not enough the 
chinese government should expel all foreign reporters who 
spread rumors make trouble and insult china he said 
the article was accompanied by another commentary saying the 
article shows that foreign journalists have been spreading rumors in 
china for decades 
the press freedoms of imperialist countries havent 
progressed at all it said 
it said li dazhaos writings were reprinted to show that the 
rumormongering of voice of america the american 
governmentfunded radio station was not an accidental mistake 
voice of america regarded by its large chinse audience as one of 
the few independent sources of information available has been 
repeatedly attacked by the government for its reporting on the 
democracy movement 
china ordered seven reporters including two from voa to leave 
during the crisis in june which led to troops firing on 
demonstrators killing hundreds and perhaps thousands 
a third commentary in sundays economic information criticized 
leaders of the democracy movement for calling for freedom of the 
press saying they have an idealized view of western freedoms 
official newspapers in may gave colorful accurate coverage of 
the prodemocracy protests exhibiting a degree of journalistic 
independence never before seen in china but in the current 
crackdown on dissent they have reverted to conveying the party line 
sundays commentary claimed that press freedoms do not exist in 
western countries and that the american media are controlled by 50 
powerful companies that not only hold the media organizations 
economic lifeblood but also directly intervene in their reporting 
and editing policies 
it singled out political scientist yan jiaqi for beautifying 
the press freedoms of western countries and shanghais world 
economic herald for showing unusual interest in political 
questions 
yan an adviser to ousted party chief zhao ziyang fled to the 
west shortly after the june military attack the herald was 
temporarily shut down and its editor qin benli was fired for 
supporting the studentled movement 
in socialist china to be a journalist of the party means 
to be of one mind with the party the article said 
the commentaries sunday follow a series of essays in recent weeks 
on the role of journalism in china 
japanese sources said premier li told former foreign minister 
masayoshi ito who is heading a fivemember parliamentary delegation 
to china that martial law must continue because hundreds of weapons 
seized by citizens during the june 34 clash with the military have 
yet to be retrieved 
the premier in his meeting with japanese leaders said life in 
beijing had returned to normal but antigovernment forces still 
exist and the military was needed to assist police in maintaining 
order the japanese sources reported 
the sources said ito urged li to lift martial law soon he also 
said that although japan did not want to interfere in chinas 
internal affairs china should realize that the military suppression 
of the protesters had hurt chinas international image

republicans may propose a new strategy monday 
to pay for the war on drugs as congress continues its debate on 
president bushs plan to fight narcotics trafficking senate 
minority leader bob dole said sunday 
with two weeks before the start of a new fiscal year congress is 
scrambling to pass a dozen money bills needed to keep the government 
running but is stymied over how to wage and finance the war on 
drugs 
the money measures are stacked up in the senate like planes over 
a busy airport as negotiators try to work out the politically 
charged drug issue with both democrats and republicans angling to 
show they care more than the other side about the narcotics scourge 
we have fundamentally different objectives and goals said 
sen joseph biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee he said democrats will be content only if the growth in 
the number of cocaine addicts is reversed drug treatment is 
provided for all who want it and drug education is extended to 
nearly every school child in the country 
there are glaring deficiencies in bushs plan particularly 
in those areas biden said and signaling his partys intention to 
make drugs a political battleground he promised a much broader 
democratic strategy to be elucidated in the weeks and months ahead 
republicans claimed the issue as their top priority as well and 
said bush had fulfilled his mandate by proposing an ambitious and 
comprehensive antidrug package 
dole said sunday on nbcs meet the press that i dont think 
we find any problem in the presidents package 
bush himself said he remains flexible about how to pay for the 
initiative but added i strongly believe that we must retain the 
integrated elements of this drug strategy which took more than six 
months to develop 
the president proposed increasing spending by 15 billion over 
what he had asked in his initial fiscal 1990 budget request with 
the heaviest emphasis on law enforcement and prosecution he sought 
to pay for the program by reducing spending on other domestic 
programs 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
then upped the ante by proposing an additional 22 billion in 
spending to be paid for with an acrosstheboard spending cut of 
about half a percent byrds emphasis was on treatment and education 
senate negotiators for the two sides nine democrats and nine 
republicans were to meet again late monday to see whether 
agreement could be reached on a drugfighting plan and a way to pay 
for it but until such a package could be worked out the spending 
bills that will include any payment scheme were effectively frozen 
in place 
itll be a critical meeting dole said we may make a 
counter offer at that time republican 
dole rejected byrds proposal and said we ought to look at more 
than acrosstheboard cuts we ought to look at other ways to 
find the money 
as the senate wrangled over drugs the house democratic 
leadership was seeking to formulate an alternative to the capital 
gains tax cut approved last week by the ways and means committee 
the taxwriting panel handed bush a major victory on the issue 
but democrats want to head it off on the house floor by offering an 
alternative tax package that would be more philosophically in tune 
with their theme of fighting for the middle class possibly 
including a new tax break for individual retirement accounts 
the house floor agenda for the week included consideration of a 
270 million bill to provide for increased security and weapons 
detection systems at airports and legislation that would regulate 
shipping to prevent catastrophic accidents such as the alaskan oil 
spill and make those involved in oil transportation pay the full 
costs of cleanup

presidentelect fw de klerk 
has won praise for allowing huge antiapartheid marches but 
political analysts said sunday the honeymoon will be brief unless he 
quickly brings reforms 
in a major policy shift de klerk said tuesday that police will 
not disrupt peaceful demonstrations previously banned or forcefully 
dispersed 
a day later 20000 activists in cape town staged the countrys 
largest legal demonstration followed by similar protests friday in 
johannesburg and pretoria 
nice going fw but whats next the sunday star of 
johannesburg asked in an editorial a few protest marches do not 
alter the fundamental apartheid system which governs our lives 
the window of opportunity for reform is open but it will not 
remain so for long 
de klerk to be sworn into office wednesday says he wants to 
give the 28million voteless black majority a limited role within 
five years in the national government now dominated by leaders of 
south africas 5 million whites 
on saturday de klerk named gerrit viljoen the former minister 
of black education to spearhead government efforts to negotiate a 
new constitution with blacks 
viljoen who has a doctorate in literature is a bookish 
softspoken political moderate closely allied with de klerk 
black leaders are skeptical of de klerks promises and bringing 
them to the negotiating table will not be easy they refuse to have 
talks with the government saying it first must end the 3yearold 
state of emergency release political prisoners such as nelson 
mandela and legalize the guerrillabacked african national congress 
and other banned organizations 
activists say they will analyze de klerks offer at a major oct 
7 conference in johannesburg on strategy to end south africas 
apartheid system of legal race discrimination 
we will have an opportunity to look at mr de klerks 
promises and his ability to fulfill them antiapartheid leader 
the rev allan boesak said saturday 
meanwhile activists will pursue a 6weekold nationwide campaign 
of defiance that has targeted segregated schools hospitals 
beaches buses and other facilities 
a march through downtown durban is scheduled friday and 
additional beach protests are set for the end of september 
de klerks calls for reform remain vague and likely will draw 
fire from activists and conservatives when he begins to spell out 
changes 
he has done little more than commit himself to the political 
equivalents of apple pie and mothers love negotiated solutions 
and a peaceful prosperous society wrote lester venter political 
columnist for the sunday times the countrys largest paper the 
content of the mans political vision is not yet clear 
the extremeright conservative party which opposes all 
concessions to blacks has harshly attacked de klerk for authorizing 
the demonstrations 
a knife has been thrust in the back of the upholders of law and 
order said conservative spokesman moolman mentz 
several local newspapers reported de klerk approved the protests 
despite opposition from security officials who seldom were 
overruled by de klerks retiring predecessor pw botha 
de klerk calls for an end to discrimination but insists he will 
preserve segregated schools and neighborhoods for whites who want 
them 
he also has made clear he will not accept a oneman onevote 
political system or black majority rule

president bushs decision earlier this year to 
cancel the navys f14d jet fighter that achieved fame in the movie 
top gun touched off a major campaign in congress to save the 
carrier aircraft 
the lobbying paid off last month when the house approved a bill 
that restored 1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years 
the senate in its defense bill had endorsed the presidents 
plan to kill the tomcat fighter 
as members of the house and senate get down to fashioning a final 
version of the defense bill during the coming week congressional 
backers of the f14d are taking heart in the woes of another 
aircraft the advanced tactical fighter 
the two prototypes of the plane one for the navy and one for 
the air force will not share a common design forcing the defense 
department to pay for two separate fighter plane programs according 
to recent reports 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said at a hearing earlier this month that development of the 
nextgeneration aircraft which is intended to succeed the air 
forces f15 and the navys f14d has slipped six months 
the problems prompted the house in its appropriations bill to 
eliminate the 11 billion for the air forces fighter and 65 
million for the navys version in the fiscal 1990 budget 
the house appropriations committee is not convinced that 
the atf program as currently structured will meet the requirement 
with a mission and cost effective solution the panel said in its 
report accompanying the spending bill 
specifically the committee complained that the air force 
predicts the atf will be built at a rate of 72 per year yet it has 
been unable to achieve such a sustained rate for the f15 which by 
any measure is a much cheaper aircraft 
the panel also noted that in the last six months the cost of 
research and development of the program has increased by 900 
million to 135 billion 
with the air force planning to buy 750 advanced tactical fighters 
at a total cost of about 64 billion and the navy planning to 
replace the f14d with the atf the price could exceed the 70 
billion for the b2 stealth bomber program 
that batwinged aircraft is considered the most expensive in 
history 
lawmakers indicated last week that although the problems of the 
advanced tactical fighter have raised concerns on capitol hill and 
may help the f14d campaign the housesenate conferees likely will 
restore much of the money for the radarevading fighter 
the action by the house was the proverbial shot across the bow 
members said 
it was a strong message to the administration and the air 
force said rep norman dicks dwash a member of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on defense 
two groups are building prototypes of the plane northrop and 
mcdonnell douglas are building the design known as yf23 while 
lockheed boeing and general dynamics are constructing yf22 the 
prototypes are scheduled to fly next year with the contract to be 
awarded in january 1991 
ideally the atf will replace the f14d manufactured by grumman 
corp of new york without a void in the navys line of carrier 
fighters 
we hope to sequence in the atf and not have a gap said rep 
joseph m mcdade of pennsylvania ranking republican on the 
appropriations defense subcommittee

william bennetts visit to philadelphia this 
week kicks off a new phase of the bush administrations war on drugs 
after an intense behindthescenes struggle by state politicians 
seeking more federal money and a share of the spotlight 
pennsylvania lawmakers want the extra federal money that would 
come with designation of the city as a highintensity drug 
trafficking area but they also worry about the effect such a 
declaration would have on the citys image 
at the same time the states two republican senators are 
offering different advice to bennett arlen specter wants more 
emphasis on crime prevention while john heinz puts the focus on 
punishment of offenders 
to qualify for the extra money under the 1988 federal drug law 
an area must be a major drug distribution center that already has 
committed itself to solving the problem 
its difficult for the city which i think is making heroic 
efforts to get not only drug abuse but drug dealing under 
control heinz said at the same time we have to demonstrate to 
bill bennett not only that the city is making a good effort but 
that the problems are growing and that they are potentially worse in 
philadelphia than in many other american cities 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
plans to visit philadelphia on monday the new york city area 
tuesday and cleveland on wednesday 
details of his schedule were not immediately released for 
security reasons the announcement of the trip set off immediate 
jockeying by heinz specter and philadelphia officials to define 
bennetts itinerary 
bennett is making the trip to promote the bush administrations 
79 billion plan calling for a crackdown on all levels of drug 
trafficking 
philadelphia lobbyists and city officials expressed concern that 
efforts to dramatize the need for federal might create the 
impression that the city has failed 
but specter said i do not think it is any big secret that 
philadelphia has a major drug problem just like new york city and 
los angeles and miami and other cities i think people would be 
surprised if their elected officials did not do everything possible 
to prevent it 
heinz agreed on the seriousness of the problem 
reported drug crimes rose 74 percent in philadelphia in 1988 
while the citys murder rate exceeded one per day for the first time 
in eight years he said in a letter to bennett requesting the 
philadelphia visit

five political veterans are leading eight others 
in the primary race for mayor of seattle often touted as one of the 
nations most liveable cities but facing problems with crime 
desegregation and traffic 
the large field without any clear frontrunner contributed to a 
largely hohum race for tuesdays primary said deputy mayor charles 
stafford an 18year city hall veteran 
the top two finishers in the primary for the nonpartisan office 
meet in a runoff nov 7 there are no statewide candidates on the 
ballot this year but an unusual number of cities across washington 
state are selecting successors to outgoing mayors 
mayor charles royer is leaving after an unprecedented three 
fouryear terms to become director of the institute of politics at 
the john f kennedy school of government at harvard university 
although there is no overwhelming favorite city councilman norm 
rice who is seeking to become seattles first black mayor is 
generally seen as the likely top votegetter randy revelle a 
former city councilman and county executive and doug jewett the 
city attorney are considered best bets for the no 2 runoff spot 
also given a shot are council members dolores sibonga and jim street 
judging partly by voter turnout in 1985 when royer defeated rice 
by a more than 5to3 margin bob bruce of the king county records 
and elections division has predicted about 28 percent of the citys 
approximately 300000 registered voters will cast ballots 
in recent years seattle consistently has been picked as one of 
the countrys best places to live do business and raise children 
its maritime environment mountain views and booming economy rank 
high in magazine surveys 
i dont want to sound too selfserving but its kind of hard 
to beat up on the government said royer the incumbent weve 
done a good job the city is in terrific financial shape 
however at the same time burglary rates are skyrocketing there 
is debate over school desegregation and traffic congestion rivals 
that of los angeles 
the leading mayoral candidates differ less on these issues than 
on terms of experience leadership and style 
i think it is very difficult to define any big differences in 
terms of the issues said rice 
there is a strong overlap among all of us in terms of a 
progressive liberal approach to social services housing and these 
sorts of issues said street 
jewett is the only major candidate who supports an initiative to 
end mandatory busing for school desegregation partly by diverting 
some 4 million a year in city tax revenues to finance projects 
designed to attract a racial balance by voluntary school 
registration 
also on the ballot are mountaineers club president carsten lien 
and advertising man david stern credited with creating the smiling 
yellow happy face the face figured in a 1967 ad campaign for a 
local bank and sterns using it now in his own campaign 
for whose who call the vacantly smiling circle superficial stern 
counters the happy face is not frivolous its a symbol of my 
optimism and thats important we need optimism im very 
optimistic about this city 
candidates with almost no visible campaign organizations are herb 
gandy a boeing co photographer bob hegamin a retired city light 
engineer pete mitchell a ballard business operator robbie scherr 
a socialist workers party activist constance paulson a navy 
veteran and bob willmott founder of the free food and shelter 
group strand helpers

the hatfields and mccoys dont fight 
anymore and many of them would just as soon forget their ancestors 
feud but some in the community are trying to find a way to 
commemorate the bloodshed 
there are a lot of grandsons of devil anse hatfield and his 
brothers around here said paul mcallister director of the new 
matewan development center most of them are in their 60s and 
theyre a little bit bitter about the reputations they had to grow 
up with and live with 
the matewan development center located in the only threestory 
building in the town of 800 features a photo display on the 
massacre and other incidents in the towns history it draws a few 
people a week mcallister is hoping the national park service will 
help turn matewan into a tourist attraction he envisions a museum 
for instance within 10 years 
its been 100 years this month since a jury sentenced eight 
hatfield clan members to life in prison and ordered a ninth hanged 
for the slaying of five mccoys ending the bloodshed in which 10 to 
20 people died 
but most participants died of old age the hatfields patriarch 
william anderson devil anse hatfield got religion and gained 
community respect before he died in 1921 at the age of 83 his grave 
at sarah ann in logan county is marked by a towering italian marble 
sculpture of him the leader of the mccoys randolph old ranl 
mccoy embittered by the deaths of five of his 16 children moved to 
town in pikeville ky dying in 1910 at age 85 
buried with them are the real reasons behind the feud in the 
heart of appalachia 
what is known is that the hatfields living mainly in what is now 
mingo county wva and the mccoys in pike county ky fought on 
and off for a dozen years in the regions wooded tangle of valleys 
and ridges 
some say the feud started in 1878 over a pig that belonged to the 
mccoys and ended up in a hatfield pen others say the dispute 
stemmed from the civil war in which this version goes the 
hatfields fought for the confederacy and the mccoys the union 
others say both families fought for the south 
romantics say the feud stemmed from an illicit affair between 
johnse hatfield and roseanna mccoy and that she eventually bore him 
a child out of wedlock 
in a 1988 book feud hatfields mccoys and social change in 
appalachia 18601900 author altina waller contends the feud was 
the result of a clash between the traditional culture based on 
subsistence farming represented by the mccoys and the emergence of 
capitalism fueled by coal mining timber cutting and railroad 
interests in the hatfields region 
whatever the cause open warfare between the families began in 
1882 when devil anses brother ellison hatfield was stabbed two 
dozen times and shot during an election day brawl in pike county 
the hatfields seized the three mccoys responsible and when ellison 
died they were tied to paw paw trees and executed 
the feud escalated until new years day 1888 when the hatfields 
attacked the mccoy home in pike county burning it to the ground and 
killing two of old ranls children 
the governors of kentucky and west virginia became involved in a 
jurisdictional dispute over the fighting that wound up before the 
us supreme court 
now mcallisters organization is trying to find a way to 
commemorate the feud and the 1920 matewan massacre a downtown 
gunbattle between united mine workers sympathizers and coal company 
guards in which at least nine people died the incident was depicted 
in the 1987 movie matewan 
robert mccoy a former matewan mayor is among those who had to 
grow up with the stigma attached to the feud even though his branch 
of the family had economic ties to devil anse and never took part in 
the bloodshed 
not every mccoy or every hatfield participated in the 
shootouts mccoy said were directly related to the socalled 
feudists but we werent participants in the violent part of it 
but mccoy also is on the matewan development centers board of 
directors whose plans call for historic restoration downtown 
as a member of the family i probably get a little tired of it 
through the years ever since i was in high school it has been 
brought to my attention he said 
but as a community i think its one of our great hopes for 
economic survival here

richer countries like the united states had a 
good year in 1988 and so did some in the third world like south 
korea and india the world bank reported sunday but incomes in 
latin america and southern africa continued to fall 
the bank said 21 industrial countries from luxembourg to the 
united states increased their production by a combined 42 percent 
since their populations increase slowly the average income of each 
citizen went up almost as much 
some countries in asia had much bigger increases in output but 
populations grow faster there holding down per capita growth 
the bank is owned by 151 governments with the united states 
holding the largest block of shares 
bank representatives gather here this week for the annual meeting 
of the bank and its sister organization the international monetary 
fund treasury secretary nicholas f brady will represent the united 
states and president bush is expected to speak 
a major topic will be progress made with bradys new attempt to 
cut the burden of third world countries 13 trillion debt and the 
131 billion they had to pay on it last year he wants banks to 
forgive some debt or lower interest rates instead of just lending 
new money the first deals have been worked out for mexico and the 
philippines critics call them too small to let the debtor countries 
keep the money they need to create jobs raise their low incomes and 
buy goods from the united states and others 
the central goal of the world bank is the reduction of 
poverty the annual report said ways to achieve that are at the 
heart of the banks activities 
it concentrated heavily on loans to countries in southern africa 
except for the republic of south africa which does not borrow from 
the bank that is one of the worlds poorest areas 
the world bank gets most of its funds from profits generated on 
loans just over 109 billion in the past year since no dividends 
are paid all the profits are plowed back into the banks lending 
officials point out that the banks object is to raise living 
standards in the borrowing countries not to make money 
its annual economic survey concentrated on lowincome countries 
and found that china and india were the fastest growing in that 
category china with 112 percent growth and india with 8 percent 
india remained the biggest borrower from the bank as it has been 
in recent years taking about 3 billion despite its record of 
growth india remains one of the poorest countries the bank 
estimated the income of the average indian both at 300 dollars in 
1987 the most recent figure available the chinese average was 290 
the newly industrialized economies of east asia continued their 
strong growth also over 8 percent as a group the bank said 
the newly industrialized group includes such countries as south 
korea with a 2690 average income in 1987 and singapore with a 
7940 average 
it is also notable that a number of secondtier newly 
industrializing countries indonesia malaysia and thailand in 
particular are moving into higher performance categories the 
report said 
production grew by only 14 percent in latin america and the 
caribbean that was slower than the growth of population so average 
incomes were down again in southern africa production growth 
reached 3 percent but the high birth rate resulted in a another 
drop of average incomes

it may not be the crime of the century when 
your neighbor fails to corral his 45 cats or stocks his yard with 
junked cars but its the kind of crime judge larry potter 
understands 
potter runs one of at least 12 local courts around the country 
that focus exclusively on environmental cases violations of 
sanitation building or fire codes 
its been called the rat court and a large number of our 
cases do involve rat infestations potter said 
he started his onedayaweek environmental court in 1982 and 
spends a good bit of his time now telling other cities how to set up 
similar operations 
these matters can be very important even though what we 
generally think of as environmental problems are toxic wastes 
potter said these are cases that affect us all on a daytoday 
basis cities nationwide are contacting us its a concept whose 
time has come 
potter a city judge uses his court to force reluctant landlords 
to maintain their property make wouldbe trash dumpers shy away 
from vacant lots and even force lazy homeowners to mow their lawns 
it takes a bit of creative judicial work since municipal courts 
like potters have limited powers he can put people in jail only in 
extreme cases and for short periods of time and the fines he can 
impose for a single violation are small 
but potter said he discovered early on that he can string those 
small fines into a big one if he decides a person is guilty of a 
continuing violation 
if for example city inspectors show that the toilet in a rental 
apartment has been broken for a month potter can charge the 
landlord 50 for each day it did not work and each day it remains 
broken 
then you really do get their attention he said 
potter lacks the authority to order a landlord to fix such a 
toilet but when he offers a dramatic cut in the cumulative fine 
repairs are generally made in short order 
all environmental cases filed with the city court go before 
potter and he deals each friday afternoon with 10 to 30 defendants 
edith beaty state coordinator of a citizens group called the 
clean tennessee program said potters was one of the first two or 
three municipal courts in the country to put all environmental cases 
before the same judge 
there are now at least a dozen and there may be 18 
environmental courts or environmental dockets across the country 
said ms beaty also the state representative for keep america 
beautiful inc a national environmentalquality group 
setting up an environmental court saves money increases 
efficiency and helps assure that cases involving sewer leaks or fire 
hazards are given adequate attention she said 
if i were a judge and i had somebody in front of me for rape or 
burglary and the next case was somebody with litter in his yard 
which am i going to be concerned with ms beaty said 
and city inspectors who look for fire housing or sanitation code 
violations are more vigorous when they know there is a judge who 
will hear their cases she said 
in the old days she said they used the courts as a 
bluff 
since the memphis court began its environmental docket city 
inspectors have attended annual seminars on how to present their 
arguments to a judge potter said 
and his friday afternoon sessions he said often attract groups 
of spectators from citizens organizations interested in 
neighborhood preservation 
they dont always win but they like to see that something is 
being done he said they felt for years that nothing was being 
done

war veterans young people and solidarity 
activists on sunday quietly marked the 50th anniversary of the 
invasion of poland by the soviet red army 
the government appealed for dignified demonstrations and the 
observations were small compared to those held sept 1 for the 50th 
anniversary of the nazi invasion of poland that started world war ii 
but for poles sept 17 1939 was just as tragic when the red 
army entered from the east poland was divided and millions were 
deported killed or forced to remain in the soviet union after the 
war 
may sept 17 1939 never be repeated in any nation again 
cardinal henryk gulbinowicz told more than 100000 pilgrims at an 
annual workers mass in the southern city of czestochowa 
the new solidarity government in an appeal on national 
television saturday night upheld the right to mark the event but 
urged that ceremonies be held in a calm manner 
the appeal for calm was repeated throughout sunday on the radio 
in previous years demonstrations on the anniversary were often 
broken up by police 
in warsaw about 1000 people met at the tomb of the unknown 
soldier to lay wreaths representing the home army the underground 
resistance force that fought both the nazis and the red army the 
warsaw chapter of solidarity and the confederation for an 
independent poland a small independence group 
fifty years of spitting at our history these are the effects 
of sept 1 and sept 17 the effects of the plot by the two biggest 
criminals in world history hitler and stalin edward bohdan a 
home army veteran told the crowd 
many of the same group later went to a monument in warsaws 
powazki military cemetery for the more than 4000 polish officers 
killed by soviet security forces in the katyn forest in 1940 
bohdan said reconciliation with the soviets would not be possible 
until they soviets tell the truth about the massacre the 
soviets maintain the officers were killed by the nazis while polish 
and western documents say the soviets were responsible 
in the baltic port of gdansk supporters of the stillbanned 
independent students union and other youth groups held a rally as 
did activists of fighting solidarity a hardline splinter group 
that opposes dialogue with communists 
this year as a result of the more tolerant political climate in 
poland even hardline newspapers such as the communist party daily 
trybuna ludu have carried reports on what happened during and after 
the soviet invasion 
those facts have been well known to a large part of the polish 
public for many years as a result of teachings in church 
independent publications and the experience of poles who lived 
through the war 
trybuna ludu said saturday that the soviet invasion resulted in 
repression and mass crimes involving millions of poles 
the date of sept 17 is deeply rooted in the consciousness of 
the polish nation especially because the entry of soviet troops was 
followed by growing repressions and even mass crimes which involved 
millions of poles trybuna ludu said 
gradually the party has been opening archives and treating the 
subject of the soviet invasion and other painful events with greater 
frankness 
in czestochowa solidarity leader lech walesa told more than 
100000 workers that a decade of struggle for union rights had 
finally succeeded 
speaking at the end of a mass at the jasna gora monastery walesa 
said that we have come here to give thanks for our regained 
rights 
a year ago walesa told a smaller crowd that legal recognition of 
the longbanned union was very close solidarity then had just 
agreed to end a wave of strikes and enter into talks with 
authorities 
the union was legalized and now solidaritys tadeusz masowiecki 
heads the government as prime minister

lawmakers in armenia under virtual economic 
blockade from neighboring azerbaijan met in emergency session 
sunday to ask the kremlin for help in restoring deliveries of food 
and fuel activists said 
on saturday the legislature of azerbaijan again laid claim to 
nagornokarabakh a hilly region mostly populated by armenians that 
has been the focus of a bloody territorial conflict between the two 
soviet republics for the 18 months 
speaking by telephone from yerevan armenias capital an editor 
at the official armenpress news agency said that during the past 14 
days not a single freight car with cargo has arrived in armenia 
over rail routes originating in azerbaijan 
the editor who was cut off before he could give his name said 
5000 freight cars were also overdue in the area of armenia that was 
devastated by an earthquake in december the earthquake killed 
25000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless 
armenian activist rafael popoyan said the republics communist 
party chief suren arutyunyan told armenias legislature at the 
emergency session that during the past two months armenia has not 
been receiving food construction materials or food due to the 
blockade 
a resolution submitted for the armenian supreme soviets 
consideration denounces the blockade as an act of aggression and 
demands the national moscowbased legislature take urgent measures 
to restore shipments to armenia and nagornokarabakh within 24 
hours popoyan said 
the special session of the armenian legislature will also 
consider the situation in nagornokarabakh which was part of mostly 
moslem azerbaijan for more than 65 years despite its largely 
armenian and christian population 
more than 100 people have died in ethnic bloodshed since armenia 
and azerbaijan began fighting over the district in february 1988 in 
an attempt to end the killing the kremlin placed the district under 
its direct control in february 
azerbaijans parliament reaserted its right to rule 
nagornokarabakh on saturday calling the district an integral part 
of the republic and noting that the soviet constitution classifies 
it as such 
the intractable quarrel will be one of the thorniest problems 
faced by the soviet communist party leadership when it meets tuesday 
in moscow to try to redefine policy towards the countrys more than 
130 ethnic groups and seek solutions to ethnic conflicts 
soviet press accounts have commonly blamed the cutoff in freight 
shipments to armenia on striking azerbaijani railway workers but 
the scope of the blockade indicates officials in azerbaijan either 
are taking an active part in it or are doing little to end it 
staterun radio moscow reported sunday that the single rail 
station in nagornokarabakh in the administrative center of 
stepanakert has been out of operation for 10 days because trains 
bound there are halted 13 miles away in the azerbaijan city of agdam 
by road convoys with fuel and food bound for nagornokarabakh 
are stopped in the adjoining azerbaijani areas the radio added 
for lack of fuel farm work in the district has stopped radio 
moscow said no fuel is available for private cars even 
ambulances emergency service vehicles and police cars receive 
rationed fuel supplies it said

steven stayner kidnapped at the age of 7 
and forced to live as the sexually abused foster son of his abductor 
until he escaped seven years later has been killed in a hitandrun 
traffic accident 
he sure led a rough life california highway patrol sgt bill 
balestra said of stayner who was returned to his parents less than 
10 years ago and was the subject of an nbc miniseries in may titled 
i know my first name is steven 
balestra said stayner 24 married and the father of two 
children was killed saturday when a car pulled into the path of his 
motorcycle on a highway between merced and atwater some 70 miles

driver of the car who abandoned his car two miles away jumped into 
another car and fled he said felony hitrun charges were planned 
the officer said the car had pulled out of a private driveway and 
crossed in front of stayner who then ran into it 
balestra said stayner who the chp reported had been riding 
without a helmet suffered massive head injuries and was 
pronounced dead on arrival at merced community medical center 
in 1972 when he was 7 stayner was grabbed off a street in 
merced while walking home from school seven years later his 
abductor snatched another boy 5yearold timmy white 16 days 
later on march 1 1980 stayner walked into a ukiah police station 
with timmy saying he didnt want the younger boy subjected to the 
same abuse he experienced

angolan guerrilla leader jonas 
savimbi says zairean president mobutu sese sekos attempt to 
negotiate an end to the civil war in his country is likely to fail 
and another mediator should be found 
savimbis remarks saturday night appeared to rule out any hope 
that an african summit monday in kinshasa the zairean capital 
would reinstate a truce in angolas 14yearold civil war 
i think mobutu is not the only one who can make the 
reconciliation happen i dont see how he is going to continue 
i think he is going to fail savimbi told reporters 
without naming anyone savimbi also said time will prove that 
somebody was telling lies to one of the sides 
at issue are claims that savimbi agreed to go into exile and 
permit the integration if his guerrilla forces into the angolan 
army savimbi repeatedly has denied agreeing to either condition 
his national union for the total independence of angola wants to 
contest elections to win a share in a government which with cuban 
and soviet aid fought its way to power when portuguese colonizers 
hastily withdrew from the southern african nation in 1975 
the us state department released a statement sunday saying it 
strongly supports the guerrillas and its goals of national 
reconciliation followed by free and fair elections 
the united states does not accept the concept of exile 
amnesty or integration it said 
savimbi said he will not attend the kinshasa summit despite 
pressure from his backers in washington unless mobutu disassociates 
himself from efforts to force him into exile 
the angolan rebels get 15 million a year from the united states 
funneled through zaire mobutu also has given the guerrilla leader 
substantial assistance 
but on saturday savimbi accused mobutu of siding with angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos 
he said it would be possible for someone else to take over the 
peace negotiations 
we are for genuine reconciliation for a lasting peace if 
anyone will negotiate this we are for him said savimbi 
he was in abidjan for a meeting with ivorian president felix 
houphouetboigny whom african diplomats said he favored to take 
over as mediator 
savimbi also said fighting had intensified in angola in the last 
two weeks with his guerrillas killing nearly 1000 government troops 
while losing 300 men officials of the luanda government also have 
reported increased fighting 
under an agreement mediated by mobutu a ceasefire began june 
24 fighting quickly resumed with dos santos accusing the rebels of 
widespread violations 
savimbi acknowledged some attacks saying it was difficult to 
communicate with thousands of irregulars spread across the country 
but also charged dos santos with launching a major offensive 
savimbi added that reports he had accepted money to go into exile 
had angered some of his supporters and provoked them to launch 
attacks despite the ceasefire several african heads of state have 
said mobutu told them savimbi had agreed to go into exile 
the guerrilla leader said his troops have turned back an 
offensive by 10000 government soldiers without help from south 
africa whose troops would intervene before an agreement last year 
for the withdrawal of cuban forces from angola in return for 
namibian independence

senate minority leader bob dole said sunday 
that while expanding individual retirement account benefits would be 
more politically popular cutting the top capital gains tax rate 
would be of greater benefit overall 
dole said on nbcs meet the press that president bush is on 
the right course pressing for a cut in taxes on profits from the 
sale of stocks real estate and other investments the house ways 
and means committee last week approved the reduction 
lets create some jobs lets make the cost of capital 
cheaper which would make the country more competitive on the 
world market dole said he conceded though that i assume the 
ira politically is more popular 
the kansas republican said sen lloyd bentsens proposal to 
restore partial tax deductions on contributions to iras is a great 
idea but he said the proposal would cost 12 billion or more over 
a fiveyear period and where do you find the money 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee 
defended his proposal on cbs face the nation saying both his 
plan and the capital gains tax cut would lose money for five years 
before benefits would be seen 
but he said his plan would help average folks far more people 
would be able to take advantage of it than could a capital gains 
cut 
his proposal would allow a deduction of at least 50 percent for 
all ira accounts and would allow the withdrawal of ira funds without 
penalty even prior to retirement for a downpayment on the 
purchase of a first home or to finance college costs 
what it really does is get those interest rates down in this 
country so we can be competitive with foreign nations bentsen 
said and itd let people pay for that college education for their 
children and to buy that first home thats getting tougher and 
tougher to accomplish 
bentsen said his plan could be accomplished without raising 
taxes but pressed on where the money would be found he said 
theres no way i can accomplish that on a show of this duration 
on another controversial topic dole and bentsen found themselves 
in basic agreement both saying they will try to block efforts to 
repeal the medicare catastrophic program but will work to scale back 
benefits to reduce costs to senior citizens 
im going to move the bill back to what it was when it was 
originally introduced which would give medicare beneficiaries the 
option of taking the catastrophic insurance bentsen said 
both senators said they want to reduce substantially or eliminate 
the surtax on medicare beneficiaries a maximum of 800 or 1600 
for a couple this year that has raised intense and vocal 
opposition among the elderly 
lets dont throw out all the benefits because even though 
senior citizens are upset theyre going to need some of those 
benefits weve got to provide the leadership and weve got to take 
the heat for it dole said 
sen john mccain rariz a prime mover behind the program 
designed to protect the elderly against catastrophic illness said 
he wants to see the surtax eliminated and the program scaled back to 
cover only hospitalization costs associated with a catastrophic 
illness and provisions that prevent a spouse from having to 
impoverish themselves to qualify for coverage 
other provisions including coverage of outpatient prescription 
drugs should be stripped from the program to lower costs he said 
weve got to repeal the surtax keep what we can particularly 
catastrophic illness insurance which is what we promised the 
american people and then go back and address the real issue that 
the seniors want in this country and thats long term care 
mccain said on cnns newsmaker sunday 
i think theres a basic recognition that something needs to be 
done the question is what he said

east german and czechoslovak authorities 
have begun seizing passports to stop the flood of refugees fleeing 
to the west east german emigres said sunday 
hungarys foreign minister meanwhile defended his countrys 
decision to aid the immigrant exodus and said the warsaw pact should 
stick to military defense and not dictate ideology or foreign policy 
to its members 
in west germany officials said they registered 1400 new east 
german refugees during the weekend bringing to more than 16000 the 
number of east germans who have arrived since hungary threw open its 
borders to the west one week ago 
east german officials have said they would not crack down on 
visas for citizens wishing to visit hungary but refugees and 
charity workers at camps in hungary said travel documents were in 
fact being seized 
more and more people are telling us that their visas are being 
taken from them said wolfgang wagner head of the west german 
maltese aid service some have told me that state security had 
come to their apartments to take the visas 
others were forced off east german and czechoslovak trains and 
returned home wagner said in an interview a growing number were 
forced to swim the danube or find other illegal means of coming 
here he said 
going through czechoslovakia between east germany and hungary 
is the most direct route for east germans seeking to take advantage 
of hungarys open western border 
a 25yearold man from east berlin said he and 15 others entered 
hungary saturday on foot after crowding into three cars and crashing 
through several czechoslovak border barriers at the rajka crossing 
about 85 miles northwest of budapest 
he said police in bratislava took away their travel documents 
and at one point they were held at submachinegun point until they 
pledged they would not head toward the hungarian border 
hungarys role in the refugee affair has been condemned by 
hardline warsaw pact allies a senior communist foreign policy 
adviser here spoke of soviet anxiety 
its a fact that there is noticeable worry on the part of the 
soviet union gyula thuermer was quoted as saying in the vasarnapi 
hirek newspaper they are worried that hungarian events will 
become incalculable and they are also disturbed that there are open 
disagreements among their allies 
the soviets have criticized west germany but have refrained from 
directly accusing hungary of wrongdoing but czechoslovakia and 
romania distrustful of hungarys plans to hold free elections in 
june and other reforms have joined east germany in condemning 
hungary 
hungary however is seeking stronger economic ties with the west 
and has embraced social and political reform 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn said the warsaw pact should 
stop debating communist ideology and concentrate on the east blocs 
defense 
he was quoted by the yugoslav daily politika as saying the warsaw 
pact cannot determine what foreign policy steps its individual 
members should take 
the warsaw pact should not deal with ideological issues or 
with how the political situation in individual member countries is 
developing he was quoted as saying 
hungarys break with its hardline warsaw pact allies have won 
praise in the west and west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher proposed sunday a west european aid program of to support 
reforms in east europe 
genscher speaking in a radio interview compared his proposal to 
the us marshall plan that helped reconstruct western europe after 
world war ii he said the plan should include food aid rescheduling 
of credits and credit guarantees for western investments 
the aim of the plan should not be to enable those socialist 
states that refuse reforms to survive a bit longer but to give a 
chance to reformminded forces such as poland genscher said in an 
interview with west berlins rias radio station 
in austria border authorities registered more than 1600 east 
germans sunday who crossed during the night from hungary west 
german border officials in bavaria registered more than 1400 
weekend arrivals by early sunday 
the total number of east germans who have used hungary for 
passage to freedom since early summer is thought to exceed 25000 
with many fleeing illegally after hungary demonstrated its opening 
to the west in may by removing some border fortifications with 
austria

defense minister yitzhak rabin will visit egypt 
to discuss president hosni mubaraks plan for ending the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied territories officials said sunday 
arab reports said israeli soldiers shot and wounded 36 
palestinians during clashes sunday with stonethrowing protesters in 
six villages and refugee camps the army said it was checking the 
reports 
during the 21monthold uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 572 palestinians have been killed by soldiers or israeli 
civilians and 114 have been slain by fellow arabs who suspected them 
of collaborating with israel forty israelis have been killed 
rabins trip monday comes before an expected flurry of middle 
east diplomacy at the un general assembly during which israeli 
egyptian and us officials are to discuss mubaraks peace proposals 
elias freij the palestinian mayor of bethlehem in the occupied 
west bank returned sunday from a trip to tunisia where he said he 
urged plo chief yasser arafat to endorse mubaraks ideas 
freij is the first palestinian leader in the west bank to 
publicly announce a meeting with arafat in defiance of an israeli 
law that bans meetings with leaders of the palestine liberation 
organization israel television reported 
us state department officials have said mubaraks 10point 
peace plan recently presented to israeli officials could be useful 
in reviving israels proposal for palestinian elections in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
but the egyptian move also has caused a rift between the two 
major parties in israels coalition cabinet 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc opposes 
mubaraks demand that israel agree to trade land for peace it also 
opposes giving arabs in israeliannexed east jerusalem the right to 
vote in palestinian elections 
the leftleaning labor party headed by vice premier shimon 
peres accepts both points 
rabins trip approved sunday by the cabinet immediately touched 
off a new debate between the two parties recent media reports have 
portrayed the defense minister as an avid supporter of negotiations 
based on mubaraks plan 
likud ministers met after the weekly cabinet session and issued a 
statement rejecting mubaraks initiative saying it gives too much 
ground to the palestinians 
shamirs election plan presented to the united states in april 
calls for choosing palestinians to negotiate an interim peace for 
the occupied territories with the final status of those territories 
to be decided later 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the israeli proposal omits the question of future boundaries 
because of likud opposition to withdrawing from the territories 
mubarak has also offered to arrange a palestinian delegation to 
negotiate with israel that would include two men recently deported 
from the occupied lands 
the proposal is designed to satisfy both israels demand that it 
meet only palestinians from the west bank and gaza and the plos 
insistence that palestinians from outside the territories be 
included in peace talks 
israel officially refuses to talk to the plo which it views as a 
terrorist group 
if we keep making concessions then all we do is move into a 
trap set by the palestinians said yitzhak modai likuds economic 
planning minister a palestinian state would endanger our 
existence it will not happen 
labor leaders however strongly urged israel to agree to 
negotiations based on mubaraks plan as a way to end an impasse in 
peace efforts 
in my view for the first time there is a chance for a 
palestinian delegation to negotiations peres said on israel radio 
egyptian ambassador mohammed bassiouny who extended the 
invitation to rabin said sunday 
of course mr rabin is a key in the peace process now the 
ball is on the israeli side if you israel agree next month you 
will see an israeli delegation and a palestinian delegation meeting 
in cairo to discuss and talk about these problems 
can you imagine bassiouny added next month the wheels of 
peace will start 
the israeli government has formally agreed to put off a decision 
on the plan until peres and foreign minister moshe arens return from 
visits to the united states where both are expected to meet mubarak 
and us officials 
the egyptian plan has caused a split in the palestinian side as 
well the plo has announced it also will put off final judgment on 
the plan until october but the moslem fundamentalist movement 
hamas or zeal has condemned it 
no to mubaraks 10point plan said graffiti signed by hamas 
and scrawled on a wall sunday in bethlehem in the west bank 
the clashes between troops and palestinians sunday came as arabs 
observed a general strike called by hamas that shut down the 
occupied territories it was called to mark the anniversary of the 
massacre of hundreds of palestinians by israels christian allies in 
the sabra and chatila refugee camps in beirut in 1982

president najib said sunday that us 
officials are trying to bolster their aid to anticommunist rebels 
by meeting with deposed afghan king zahir shah in italy 
radical afghan guerrillas with bases in pakistan threatened to 
assassinate the former monarch if he tries to return and head a 
postwar government in kabul 
the warring sides in afghans civil war commented after reports 
that an envoy of the united states met with the exiled king in rome 
zahir shah has lived in italy since his nephew seized power in a 
1973 coup 
in his remarks najib said us talks with zahir shah were an 
attempt to bring fresh breath to the abortive military policy of 
the us government he did not elaborate 
however the president also suggested zahir shah could have a 
role in a settlement 
we have proposed that all forces within and outside the 
country including zahir shah take part in national 
reconciliation najib said 
afghanistans ruling marxists and their soviet backers have 
previously said the king could serve as compromise solution to head 
a transitional government 
but hardline rebels in islamabad pakistan warned zahir shah to 
stay away from his homeland 
he takes a very grave risk of being shot said nawab salim 
spokesman for the hezbiislami party run by antiamerican gulbaddin 
hekmatyar the mujahedeen holy warriors will not let zahir shah 
come to afghanistan 
after more than six months of trying to forge unity within the 
fractious guerrilla coalition washington reportedly is considering 
alternatives including the former monarch 
but the rebels who have received millions of us dollars in 
military and humanitarian aid during their decadelong war with 
successive communist governments are bitterly divided over a 
possible role for the 74yearold king 
abdul rahim a spokesman for the guerrillas governmentinexile 
said a royal return is tantamount to a rebel defeat it would mean 
the mujahedeen and the people of afghanistan are defeated said 
rahim 
royalists among the rebels most notably syed gailanis national 
islamic front of afghanistan say the king is the only afghan able 
to rally warring factions 
asim nasserzia a spokesman for gailanis group predicted zahir 
shah will fly to kabul from rome in january or february and retire 
after convening a traditional afghan council to oversee general 
elections 
this could happen only after najib was out of kabul he said 
pakistans army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg said sunday 
the kremlin appears willing to abandon najib 
in a briefing for reporters beg said armand hammer us oil 
magnate and confidante of moscows powerbrokers indicated the 
soviets may drop najib 
he recommended the afghan resistance negotiate with remaining 
leaders of the afghan communist groups after najib is removed 
talks with the ruling communists represent a radical departure 
from pakistans earlier policies and is rejected by all rebels 
regardless of political leanings the rebels have their headquarters 
in pakistan which also shelters more than 3 million afghan refugees 
salim charged zahir shahs possible return is a compromise being 
considered by washington and moscow because the superpowers are 
anxious to extricate themselves from the afghan war 
the united states fears a socalled fundamentalist 
government said salim whose organization is one of washingtons 
greatest critics but also is one of the major benefactors of us 
largesse 
the united states is trying to impose him zahir shah on the 
people of afghanistan said salim calling the monarch a 
traitor 
the kings greatest crime according to critics was to keep 
silent during the war particularly after 1979 when moscow sent more 
than 110000 soldiers into afghanistan 
he never cared about the jihad holy war said rahim he 
never participated practically 
the kremlin withdrew its last troops from afghanistan on feb 15 
under a unbrokered accord many observers expected the move to 
lead to a guerrilla victory but the divided resistance has not 
captured any major towns since the soviet pullout 
but a spokesman for the jamiatiislami guerrilla faction omar 
sherdul said 400 government soldiers surrendered to rebels in 
western herat province

crew teams from oxford and cambridge universities 
rowed past the sears tower and wrigley building as they moved their 
160yearold rowing rivalry from the river thames to the chicago 
river 
the events organizer peter mowbray originally wanted oxford to 
compete against a midwest team but when he realized no local teams 
could match englands talent he contacted cambridge 
oxfords nineman crew won saturdays race by less than half a 
length though it wont count in the official winloss record 
compiled since 1829 69 victories for cambridge and 66 to oxford 
which has won 14 of the last 15 matches 
only london counts but all of them matter said george 
cheveley 22 of oxford we dont ever want to lose to cambridge 
the chicago race was two miles about half that of londons and 
had a hairpin turn that prompted a staggered start 
it was the first time the british universities raced each other 
in the united states the official races are held in march on the 
thames 
the crews had some time to socialize and see the sights of 
chicago cheveley said but when we get to racing together 
theres no love lost on the water 
as the oxford team stepped up to collect their trophies they 
hoisted their 113pound coxswain or steerman on their shoulders 
and tossed him into the river 
i did a good job so thats why said martin watts 20 of 
london as he pulled himself up and wrung himself out

a roman catholic priest said sunday he would 
continue enforcing a dress code at his church despite orders from 
his archbishop that he stop refusing holy communion to people he 
considers inappropriately dressed 
the rev roger griese has barred shorts and miniskirts from 
sacred heart church and has turned away from communion people he 
considers immodestly dressed 
i do not refuse the sacrament solely on the grounds of 
inappropriate dress but rather on the unworthy motive of 
confrontation and attack which the wearers of inappropriate dress 
insist on wearing even after several warnings griese said and 
this in simple conscience i cannot change 
griese told his congregation that daniel pilarczyk the 
archbishop of cincinnati has threatened him with suspension and 
loss of his pastorate 
he threatens me with removal griese said well well see 
he doesnt have the right to do that when a person is innocent and 
has done no wrong 
if im going to be insulted by my own authorities by my own 
mission and staff i have the right to make an appeal to rome and i 
wont have any hesitancy about doing that he said 
griese read a letter from pilarczyk to the congregation at the 
end of sundays mass 
in the letter pilarczyk told griese that he too believes people 
should come to church appropriately dressed he said he also 
believes it is proper for priests to remind churchgoers of the 
respect owed to the church 
at the same time i do not believe that guidelines for dress 
can and should be enforced by refusing the sacraments to people 
wrote pilarczyk 
i have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the future 
you may not refuse holy communion or absolution in the sacrament of 
penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate dress 
i suspect that you do not agree with this but as an obedient 
priest you have said that you will carry out my wishes the letter 
said 
griese accused pilarczyk of letting down the bars and 
rewarding confronters by chastising a loyal priest who is simply 
upholding reverence for the church 
i shall not have that on my conscience griese said and no 
man has the authority or power to force another mans conscience 
the 73yearold griese said the controversy has caused him to 
lose sleep and miss meals 
but im at peace with god as to what ive done and how ive 
done it he said and if that doesnt please the archbishop 
then im very sorry but i have to follow my conscience 
ray george spokesman for the archdiocese said pilarczyk plans 
to review sundays events at sacred heart and that no statement was 
immediately planned

the government on sunday offered a 
unilateral ceasefire to sinhalese extremists if they join an 
interparty peace conference that began last week 
a statement by the presidents office said there will be no 
need for the armed forces to continue their ongoing security 
operations if leaders of the peoples liberation front attend the 
conference 
president ranasinghe premadasa called the meeting in an effort to 
end ethnic strife that has taken 16000 lives in six years the 
inaugural session wednesday was attended by 21 of sri lankas 27 
recognized parties 
the peoples liberation front rejected premadasas invitation but 
the president said he hoped it will attend later sessions the 
meetings are expected to continue through oct 12 
the latest government truce offer came as military officials said 
more than 300 people were killed last week in attacks by liberation 
front extremists and reprisal raids by progovernment vigilante 
groups 
vigilantes reportedly killed 150 people in repeated attacks on 
three kandy district villages on friday and saturday apparently in 
retaliation for the killing of three soldiers relatives in kandy by 
liberation front gunmen 
the government did not confirm the attacks on menikhinna 
kundasala and aranagala 50 miles northeast of colombo 
but a senior military official said the government had ordered a 
major crackdown on vigilante groups 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity also said 45 
members of the armed forces were arrested on suspicion of 
participating in vigilante groups 
it is evident the current situation is being exploited by 
unidentified armed groups for their own purposes this has led to a 
proliferation of weapons in our society a positiive response by the 
front to the call for peace and normalcy will enable the 
identification of these groups the presidential statement said 
a separate government statement sunday said 16 bodies of young 
sinhalese men were found in southern towns with notes nearby 
purportedly signed by the peoples liberation red army the 
liberation red army is one of five known progovernement groups 
the government has denied it supports the liberation red army or 
other groups such as the black cats yellow cats green tigers and 
the peoples revolutionary army 
opposition lawmakers and human rights organizations claim the 
government encourages such groups to intensify the crackdown on the 
liberation front an ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to 
overthrow the government 
a military offical said the death toll during the week passed 
300 he said 100 buildings were also burned in seven days the worst 
week of violence in recent months 
independent sources said the death toll exceeded 350 and 250 
buildings were burned 
the government says more than 5000 people have been killed in 
the twoyear campaign by the liberation front and blames the 
extremists for most deaths the front says vigilantes are 
responsible for many killings 
liberation front rebels began their campaign of assassinations 
and terrororist attacks to protest the governments peace overtures 
to tamil secessionists in the northeast 
the front said an accord two years ago that was sponsored by 
india made too many concessions to the minority tamils who comprise 
18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
liberation front leaders also opposed the presence of indian 
peacekeeping soldiers deployed in the northeast to supervise the 
1987 accord the largest tamil group liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam reneged on the accord and began attacking the indian troops 
at least 1000 indian soldiers have been killed in the fighting 
the tamil rebels are attending the peace conference 
the tamil secession which began in 1983 with complaints of 
discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalesedominated 
government has claimed up to 10000 sri lankan lives 
sinhalese most of whom are buddhists make up 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and the military tamils are 
predominantly buddhists 
india became involved in the ethnic problems of its southeastern 
neighbor because of the sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to 
the rebel cause

members of the florida coalition for peace and justice plan to 
join hundreds of other activists in a rally oct 8 outside the gates 
of the georgia submarine base 
coalition spokesman bruce gagnon said the activists will average 
10 miles per day stopping to distribute literature along the way 
they are protesting both the navys trident 2 program and nasas 
plans to launch a nuclearpowered spacecraft aboard the next space 
shuttle 
the spacecraft galileo waiting to be dispatched from atlantis on 
a sixyear voyage to jupiter will get its power from two nuclear 
generators containing 48 pounds of radioactive plutonium238 
the coalition has threatened to seek a court order and to 
trespass on the launch pad if necessary to stop the flight now set 
for oct 12 
nasa has released details of tests conducted on galileos radio 
isotope thermoelectric generators but the protest group is 
skeptical of space agency claims that there is virtually no chance 
of an explosion that would destroy the nuclear canisters and release 
lifethreatening radioactive fallout

tens of thousands of ukrainian catholics on sunday 
joined in their churchs biggest service since world war ii to 
demand that mikhail s gorbachevs government restore their legal 
status and end decades of repression 
the twohour outdoor mass in the ukrainian city of lvov came on 
the 50th anniversary of dictator josef stalins annexation of the 
western ukraine from poland western witnesses said the mass drew up 
to 100000 participants a ukrainian activist said 200000 people 
gathered at a later prayer session 
at dusk about 30000 ukrainians carrying candles ringed a 
central square at lvovs opera theater and observed a halfhour of 
silence to commemorate victims of the 1939 soviet takeover and the 
purges that followed 
candles of mourning also twinkled in some apartment windows of 
the city of 650000 people 
the action was designed to mirror aug 23 demonstrations in the 
three baltic republics in which more than 1 million estonians 
lithuanians and latvians joined hands to protest the annexation of 
their lands 
the baltics and the western ukraine both fell into the soviet 
orbit as a result of a secret pact between stalin and nazi german 
dictator adolf hitler 
tonight let us all turn off the electricity and put a candle in 
the window to commemorate the millions who died under stalinist 
repression ukrainian catholic activist ivan gel told the 
worshipers in lvov those candles will also symbolize the great 
hopes we have for our one our dear ukraine 
the time has come for freedom for our church declared gel 
head of the committee in defense of the ukrainian catholic church 
the ukrainians carried at least 300 blueandyellow flags of 
their once independent homeland along with crosses images of the 
virgin mary and banners reading freedom for our church 
the outdoor service under an overcast sky was only the latest 
sign of reviving nationalist consciousness in the soviet unions 
secondmost populous republic where a new grassroots prodemocracy 
group called rukh held its founding congress last week 
the ukrainian church sometimes called the uniate church has up 
to 5 million members by some western estimates and is said to be 
the largest banned religious organization in the world 
in 1946 it was accused of widespread collaboration with the 
nazis and forced to merge with the lvov synod of the russian 
orthodox church the ukrainian churchs property was confiscated and 
believers who refused to accept the reunion were brutally 
repressed or driven underground 
despite greater official tolerance of religion since president 
gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 the ukrainian church 
is still officially banned in may about 200 church members 
including gel held a hunger strike on a moscow street to demand 
legal recognition for their faith 
in a statement hunger strikers charged authorities in the 
western ukraine with waging administrative terror against 
catholic priests and believers who petition moscow for legalization 
they said some priests were being placed under administrative arrest 
for up to 15 days 
the churchs fate has been a major obstacle to improved relations 
between the vatican and the kremlin in june pope john paul ii in 
a clear reference to ukrainian believers deplored state policies 
that deny eastern rite catholics the freedom of worship 
the ukrainians status under gorbachevs reforms is likely to be 
a central issue at talks reportedy to be held between the pontiff 
and the soviet leader when they meet for the first time during a 
november trip by gorbachev to italy 
in lvov the worshipers walked three miles through the citys 
medieval center to pray outside st yuris cathedral which 
epitomizes the plight of their church the sanctuary once the seat 
of lvovs catholic bishop is now the cathedral of the local russian 
orthodox prelate 
gel estimated the worshipers numbered 200000 by the time they 
reached st yuris a turnout he said was a triumph after more 
decades of repression and official disapproval this is a moral 
victory he said look how powerful our church is 
soviet control of the western ukraine began sept 17 1939 
slightly more than two weeks after hitler started world war ii by 
attacking poland and less than a month after he and stalin reached a 
nonaggression agreement with a secret protocol dividing eastern 
europe into spheres of influence 
the red army moved into poland along a broad front of what is now 
the western soviet republics of the ukraine and byelorussia in 
1940 soviet tanks rolled into the baltic republics 
armed bands held out against soviet power in the forested hills 
of the western ukraine until almost a decade after the wars end in 
1945

soviet politician boris yeltsin wrapped up an 
eightday tour of the united states on sunday and said he had found 
americans to be industrious friendly full of good humor and 
vitality 
yeltsins first visit to the united states included meetings with 
president bush and vice president dan quayle meetings with nasa 
officials speaking engagements at colleges and a trip to an 
american grocery store 
yeltsin an outspoken critic of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
spoke sunday to about 500 people at a 100aplate luncheon 
sponsored by the university of miami graduate school of 
international studies 
he said the political situation in the soviet union was 
extremely difficult and the communist party was on the verge 
of crisis 
we have not seen an evolution of power from the party to the 
congress said yeltsin a member of parliament and former member 
of the ruling politburo 
the party has got to be subordinate to the congress of peoples 
deputies thats because the politburo is leaning too far to the 
right and pulling gorbachev with it he said through an 
interpreter 
while yeltsin assailed the conservative elements in the soviet 
union that were stalling reform he assured we are profoundly 
convinced that glasnost and democratization of our society are 
inevitable processes 
the luncheon was the last event scheduled for yeltsin who was to 
leave miami later sunday en route to the soviet union 
in houston on saturday yeltsin followed a meeting with nasa 
officials about possible ussoviet space links with an eyeopening 
visit to a grocery store saying such plenty could cause a 
revolution in his country 
even the politburo doesnt have this choice yeltsin said as 
he looked over fish and meat at randalls supermarket in clear lake 
near the johnson space center not even mr gorbachev 
when he roamed the grocery store aisles nodding his head in 
amazement at the array of food and other products yeltsin commented 
that if the soviet people who stand in lines for groceries ever saw 
a us supermarket there would be a revolution 
yeltsin tasted free samples of cheese and produce and ogled rows 
of meat we dont have this much meat in the soviet union he 
said 
he stopped several shoppers and workers asking about the food 
they selected and the cost 
one store employee offered him a single yellow rose to remember 
his trip to the lone star state and another gave him a bag of snacks 
is this what you give a starving russian yeltsin joked 
you should add some soap we need that too

the usbacked rebel force fighting 
nicaraguas sandinista government is disbanding but wont vanish all 
at once despite a central american peace accord the nicaraguan 
defense minister said sunday 
it wont be sudden like an earthquake theyll just dry up 
humberto ortega told reporters in mexico city 
he said only 500 rebels known as contras turned themselves in 
under a repatriation program called for in last months peace accord 
signed in tela honduras by five central american presidents 
but he said the contra force was crumbling through quiet 
desertion 
a lot of them dont trust us enough to turn themselves in 
theyre just putting their guns away and waiting to see what 
happens said ortega who represented nicaragua in mexicos 
independence day celebrations 
the central american presidents signed the agreement aug 7 that 
called for dismantling the contras most of whom are based in 
honduras along the border with nicaragua in return nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega promised democratic elections now scheduled 
for feb 25 
humberto ortega said the opposition coalitions presidential 
candidate violeta barrios de chamorro was allied with us 
interests 
mrs chamorro is the widow of pedro joaquin chamorro whose 
assassination helped spark the sandinista revolution that overthrew 
president anastasio somoza in july 1979 she served on the first 
postrevolutionary junta but resigned after a year and joined the 
opposition that formed mainly because of the sandinistas surge to 
the left and its links with cuba and the soviet union 
humberto ortega said the sandinista party will choose its 
candidate on sept 24 he said he thought his brother president 
daniel ortega would be the best nominee 
daniel ortegas nomination is considered a virtual certainty 
when asked what the army would do if mrs chamorro and the 
opposition wins humberto ortega said the defense forces would not 
try to control the government but he said the sandinista army 
will never be an army that serves a dominant class 
the aug 7 agreement calls for dismantling the contras by dec 8 
but humberto ortega said their complete demobilization was unlikely 
he added if the honduran base camps are shut the rebellion will 
eventually die out 
weve already reached a state of relative peace he said 
once we hold elections well be able to reach a state of complete 
peace 
the defense minister said about 60 people including civilians 
soldiers and rebels were killed in fighting in nicaragua last month 
he said there have been about 50 clashes a month between troops 
and rebels down from about 500 monthly before the united states cut 
off military aid to the contras in 1988 nonlethal us aid is 
scheduled to continue through february 
humberto ortega estimated the number of contras in nicaragua at 
2000 and the number in honduran camps at 4500 about onequarter 
the number contra leaders claim 
journalists estimate there were more than 6000 fighters in the 
main contra camp in honduras last month down sharply from more than 
10000 in february

a north korean civilian described by 
seoul authorities as a spy escort defected to south korea early 
sunday across the 25 milewide demilitarized zone the defense 
ministry announced 
it said suh yong chul a member of north koreas ruling workers 
communist party surrendered at a south korean marine outpost on 
kanghwa island at 345 am after swimming across a river on the 
western border 
ministry spokesman kim jiwook identified suh as an escort of 
north korean agents sent to south korea for espionage he gave no 
further details 
south korea accuses north korea of frequently sending spies 
across the dmz established under the truce that ended the korean 
war in 1953 
suh was the seventh north korean to defect to south korea in less 
than two months 
in the latest incident on sept10 three north koreans an army 
second lieutenant a staff sergeant and a civilian nurse crossed 
through a minefield inside the dmz and swam across a river on the 
westen front 
north korea in a report monitored in tokyo sunday said the 
united states sent a new ambassador donald gregg to south korea to 
help stop the antiamerican movement 
the official workers party newspaper rodong shinmun described 
gregg as an old secret agent who has accumulated experience in 
the us central intelligence agency for nearly 30 years 
it said the us imperialists have dispatched gregg to south 
korea with a view to quelling the south korean peoples 
antiamerican sentiment for independence and reunification with 
north korea 
gregg arrived saturday to take up his post in seoul where he 
served as the us cia station chief in 197376 
there have been increasing demands by some south korean political 
groups for withdrawal of the 43000 us troops stationed in south 
korea under a mutual defense treaty 
gregg said on arrival as long as the korean government and the 
korean public share with us the judgment that there is a need for 
our presence we will be here to assist in maintaining peace on the 
peninsula 
the peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 into 
the communist north and capitalist south the united states was one 
of 16 nations that sent troops to south koreas aid after north 
korea invaded in 1950 american troops remained to help in defense 
after the war ended in an armistice in 1953

two oil tankers collided off the northeast 
coast of england early sunday caught fire and spilled more than 
300000 gallons of crude oil into the north sea the coast guard 
said 
no injuries were reported aboard the liberianregistered phillips 
oklahoma or the malteseregistered fiona and authorities expressed 
confidence the 20milelong by sevenmilewide oil slick could be 
dispersed 
six aircraft sprayed the spreading slick with dispersants 
throughout the day a coast guard spokesman said much of the oil had 
broken into patches and there were no reports of oil coming ashore 
the fiona which anchored when the early morning collision 
occurred was damaged in the bow while the oklahoma which was 
moving was damaged in the stern said coast guard spokesman david 
clempson 
he would not comment on who was responsible for the collision he 
said an investigation would be conducted by the department of 
transport 
clempson said helicopters flew 20 firemen to the vessels and 
five firefighting tugs were at the scene five british minesweepers 
on a nato exercise were put on standby 
firefighters said it took more than three hours to contain the 
flames aboard the phillips oklahoma but the fire aboard the fiona 
was quickly controlled 
by midmorning clempson said the phillips oklahoma fires had 
been extinguished and the source of the oil leakage had been 
stopped both ships were at anchor off spurn head in the mouth of 
the humber about 150 miles north of london he said 
the phillips 66 co operators of the phillips oklahoma said the 
oil spilled from a slop tank through a hole two yards above the 
waterline 
most of that will have probably been burnt up in the fire 
clempson said the way it is heading it doesnt appear to be 
coming ashore 
the phillips oklahoma carried 56000 tons of crude oil and the 
fiona had 46500 tons of refined oil aboard clempson said 
in london a spokesman for the department of transport said 
aerial surveys indicated the spill was minor 
seventeen of 26 crew members were evacuated from the phillips 
oklahoma one crew member from the fiona was recovered from the sea 
by the minesweeper hms middleton after he jumped overboard he was 
being treated for shock and the rest of the ships 30member crew 
remained aboard

the remains of four union soldiers were 
reburied at the antietam national battlefield on sunday the 127th 
anniversary of an 1862 civil war bloodbath 
relic seekers from ohio discovered the remains of the frontline 
soldiers in march 1988 and anthropologists and archaeologists have 
been studying them since 
on sunday the remains were sealed inside a plain pine coffin 
and buried with full military honors at antietam national cemetery 
an estimated 450 people watched the civil war funeral at the 
11acre hilltop cemetery near sharpsburg where the remains of 
nearly 4700 soldiers are buried 
the four soldiers found were members of the irish brigade from 
new york which charged the confederate line sept 17 1862 and 
were killed by rifle fire 
they were among more than 23000 union and confederate soldiers 
who were killed wounded or missing after the battle of antietam 
which climaxed gen robert e lees two attempts to push the war 
farther north the battle is described as the single bloodiest day 
of the war 
the massive number of dead in the battle made the interment 
paramount said dennis frye a historian with the national park 
service they did not have time to properly bury individuals with 
independent memorial services 
douglas owsley a forensic anthropologist at the smithsonian 
institutions museum of natural history determined that two of the 
fallen soldiers were in their 20s one was in his 30s and the other 
was about 45 years old the older fellow had arthritis in his 
shoulder bones he said 
this was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability 
to associate with the men who went into battle owsley said 
normally you have the artifacts without the bones 
about 85 men from reenactment units representing the 28th 
massachusetts and the 93rd pennsylvania regiments camped at antietam 
and assisted with the burial and a roman catholic mass 
the morning service was held along bloody lane a sunken road 
in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for 
nearly four hours that day 
reenactors normally reenact history but today we are making 
history said collin macdonald 38 of centreville va who 
served as a commander for the event this is the first civil war 
burial that the park has had this century the reenactors who are 
here are making history 
a hazy ridge of south mountain provided a distant backdrop for 
the mass the coffin which rested on sawhorses was covered with a 
34star american flag some of the soldiers dressed in navy coats 
and light blue slacks knelt on one knee during the service smoke 
from morning campfires filled the air 
pallbearers placed the coffin on a horsedrawn cart drapped in 
black and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a 
milelong procession from bloody lane to the cemetery the group 
marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black

moslem leaders and lebanons christian 
patriarch voiced support for a new arab peace proposal sunday but 
christian army commander michel aoun rejected key parts of the plan 
and fighting continued 
police said one person was killed and 14 were wounded in 
nightlong artillery clashes in and around beirut that raised the 
toll to at least 915 killed and 2699 wounded since the latest 
fighting broke out on march 8 
gen aoun rejected key clauses of the sevenpoint peace plan 
announced saturday by a threemember arab league committee 
in a televised interview aoun said he would not appoint a 
representative to a lebanese security committee that would oversee a 
ceasefire under the peace plan 
i wont accept at all a lebaneselebanese committee this is 
what the syrians wanted to deceive the world and say the clashes 
have been among lebanese factions aoun said 
syria has refused to take part in a security committee 
maintaining the conflict is between aoun and his lebanese foes but 
syrian troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate allied with moslem militias as a main party in the latest 
violence 
aoun also criticized the committees call for parliament to meet 
outside lebanon to discuss political reforms demanded by the moslems 
first lebanon should be free of all occupations then reforms 
could be worked out he said that was a reference to syria and 
israel which controls a border strip in south lebanon 
aoun said he would abide by the ceasefire if syria did if 
they dont put away their guns well continue to respond to their 
fire 
he renewed his attack on washington saying the us government 
was covering up for syria washington withdrew its embassy staff 
from beirut on sept 6 after christian demonstrators surrounded the 
embassy compound demanding us action to help drive the syrians out 
saudi arabias foreign minister prince saud faisal arrived 
unexpectedly sunday in the syrian capital damascus for talks with 
syrian leaders on putting the peace plan into effect 
he delivered a letter to president hafez assad from king fahd of 
saudi arabia according to officials who would not disclose its 
contents he then met with vice president abdulhalim khaddam 
architect of syrias military intervention in lebanon 
saud was to fly to baghdad later sunday for discussions in iraq 
syrias archrival and aouns weapons supplier 
the arab league committee comprising fahd king hassan ii of 
morocco and president chadli bendjedid of algeria apppealed urgently 
saturday for an immediate ceasefire its several previous calls for 
a truce have been ignored 
lebanons acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem vying 
for power with aoun welcomed saturdays call he called it a 
chance to end the crisis that might not be repeated 
the plan does not call for syria to withdraw its 40000 troops 
whom aoun charges have betrayed their mandate by siding with the 
moslems 
the arab league statement also said algerian diplomat lakhdar 
alibrahimi will head a security committee to supervise the 
ceasefire and monitor ships to ensure no weapons reach the warring 
factions 
that will affect aoun more than the syrians his only supply 
route is by sea as the enclaves three landward sides are ringed by 
syrian forces and their allies syrias supply lines run through 
territory it controls 
fahd hassan and bendjedid called on all parties to stop 
arming the warring factions and said they have received positive

first us visit since being nominated as leader of the 
antisandinista factions 
mrs chamorro wife of slain newspaper publisher pedro joaquin 
chamorro was mobbed by supporters when she arrived in miami a city 
that received an influx of more than 100000 impoverished nicaraguan 
refugees last year 
she criticized the sandinista government for human rights 
violations and for causing the countrys economic problems and she 
appealed to nicaraguans abroad to consider returning to their 
homeland if her opposition party is successful in the feb 25 
elections

crowd in spanish but the liberty is for nicaraguans and the 
reconciliation of all the people

2 million in government funds to her campaign through the 
usfinanced national endowment for democracy

foreign groups to donate money to mrs chamorro

it took money to make money for a group of 
investors who financed a treasure hunt that struck as much as 1 
billion worth of gold off the south carolina coast 
the 106 investors in recovery limited partnership most from 
central ohio had to show a net worth of at least 750000 or income 
over 200000 per year for three years to be able sink money into 
the search for the ss central america a paddlewheel steamship that 
sank 132 years ago 
but for those who qualified and made an investment at least 
10000 each according to records filed in ohio the return 
promises to be substantial if the groups right to ownership of the 
gold is not overturned 
the booty which will take months to haul from 8000 feet of 
water nearly 200 miles out in the atlantic was three tons of 
government gold from the san francisco mint plus fortunes that 
passengers made during the california gold rush 
the gold from the mint was being transported to new york via the 
isthmus of panama when the central america sank during a hurricane 
sept 12 1857 of more than 575 people on board only about 150 
survived 
leaders of the expedition that located the wreck the columbus 
america discovery group called the find the largest american 
treasure trove ever estimates of the caches value range from 
several hundred million dollars to 1 billion 
weve found it gold lots of it we have hit the mother 
lode underwater mining specialist thomas thomspon a director of 
the group wrote in a letter to investment group members 
thompson put up no money for the expedition but is entitled to 40 
percent of the income from it according to filings with the ohio 
division of securities 
it was a high risk from day one but because of tommys 
detailed studies and efforts over the years i felt that it had a 
fair success chance said donald c fanta president of the ohio 
co brokerage and a member of the investment group 
it is a tremendous technological achievement fanta said 
a former research engineer at the battelle memorial institute in 
columbus thompson took on an unpaid leave of absence to conduct the 
search he and others pinpointed the wrecks location by 
crossreferencing news accounts of the day 
the issue of who actually owns the gold is still not completely 
settled but an admiralty court in norfolk va has already ruled 
the columbus group owns the dozens of artifacts and trinkets 
previously hauled from the steamship 
at this point the court has not considered the artifacts 
recovered this month that is to say the gold said rick robol a 
lawyer for the group the next step is a hearing on who is the 
owner of the gold 
in another ruling favorable to the columbus group judge richard 
b kellam last month made permanent an injuction prohibiting anyone 
else from entering the wreck site the admiralty court is a civil 
court that rules on maritime law 
robol said from dallas that he and his cocounsel william j 
kelly jr of columbus would request a hearing on ownership of the 
gold but said he did not know when he would make the request 
the usual procedure he said is to have the determination of 
ownership on a number of different occasions as more and more items 
are brought up from a wreck robol said 
judy conrad a historian who worked with the investors out of 
their columbus office said the find is like a storybook 
treasure 
conrad wouldnt mind if workers in the office who are not 
investors get to share a little of the wealth through a bonus of 
some sort were just depending on the kindness of strangers

the butte mont public housing authority 
failed to follow procedures in granting money for housing projects 
according to a recent audit by the department of housing and urban 
development 
because of the shortcomings hud cannot be sure money awarded 
for the projects was being spent in the most efficient and 
economical way said the audit report released aug 21 
the butte housing authority operates 356 lowincome housing units 
214 for senior citizens and 142 for families the assistance 
program provides money to improve their physical condition and 
upgrade their management as of march 1989 48 million had been 
approved for the projects 
the audit was conducted in april and may of this year 
the housing authority made budget changes without following 
written procedures particularly concerning the addition to the 
198687 budgets of 639000 to remove leadbased paint and 100000 
to repair or demolish a building the audit said because of those 
changes other items budgeted for those years such as 251000 for 
water heaters and heating units were postponed to 1988 
hud regulations call for submission of a formal budget revision 
when a major change is made 
the audit found that the butte housing authority charged expenses 
to the wrong accounts didnt keep adequate accounting records 
didnt use available resources such as 17000 worth of computer 
equipment requested money before spending what it already had and 
failed to cancel invoices to ensure bills werent paid more than 
once 
the audit also determined that the authority didnt follow hud 
requirements in awarding contracts among other discrepancies the 
authority failed to advertise or obtain hud approval for contracts 
over 10000 as required 
butte did meet hud requirements for developing and implementing a 
fiveyear plan to meet the projects physical needs but didnt 
provide a rolling fiveyear plan which would outline future 
financial needs 
the inspector generals office instructed the butte public 
housing authority to provide within 60 days a report on action taken 
to remedy the problems or why action is not needed

the title is carnage a comedy as if authors 
adam simon and tim robbins had to reassure theatergoers it was all 
right to laugh 
not many did at a preview of this messy meandering and mirthless 
satire of religious evangelism that opened sunday at the new york 
shakespeare festival public theater 
the play comes from the actors gang an acting ensemble from los 
angeles that has been putting on productions since 1981 on the west 
coast and performed carnage at the edinburgh festival in 
scotland before coming here it wasnt worth the trip 
robbins an actor best known for the movie bull durham and 
simon have concocted an unfunny and heavyhanded comic strip 
masquerading as a play one of their main characters is a preacher 
named cotton slocum a rotund shaggyhaired charlatan who sells 
religion as if it were snake oil at a place called gods happy acre 
this is not a nonprofit organization slocum insists this is 
a church 
the minister and his carefully coiffured wife tipper are always 
in the market for new ways to make money he devises a prayer walk 
during which he will pound the pavement for the lord as well as for 
monetary pledges to finance his new religious theme park 
slocums assistant is a rightwing zombie named deacon tack who 
trains paramilitary cadets on the side the man combines the fervor 
of ollie north and the personality of bela lugosi 
mixed into this fanatic folderol is a sweet dimwitted housewife 
named dot who truly believes in slocum and her husband ralph who 
participates in tacks military maneuvers they all come together in 
the desert during an incomprehensible second act it deteriorates 
into lunatic ravings mostly by tack about the upcoming armageddon 
in which the permissive society as well as the commies will be 
vanquished 
the acting is more enthusiastic than competent but lee arenberg 
is fine as the moneyhungry minister shannon holt projects the 
simple sincerity of the deluded housewife and ned bellamy is 
positively creepy as the looney deacon 
but a smirkiness and condescension pervade the proceedings 
whats more the play cant compete with the real thing jim and 
tammy bakker jimmy swaggart ollie north and all the rest of the 
people carnage attempts to harpoon are much more theatrical 
and funnier in real life than anything simon and robbins have put 
on stage

the navy is standing by its conclusion that 
a uss iowa crewman probably deliberately caused a blast aboard the 
battleship that killed 47 men despite a report that the battleship 
was being used for highexplosive experiments 
transcripts from the navy investigation of the april 19 blast 
showed that an improper type of gun powder was being used 
experimentally when the explosion occurred inside the ships no2 
turret which has three 16inch guns media general news service 
reported sunday 
everything was very carefully considered said cmdr mark 
baker a navy spokesman at the pentagon who defended the navys 
official report on the explosion 
the pentagon report said circumstantial evidence indicated 
gunners mate clayton hartwig of cleveland intentionally sparked the 
explosion however the report said it would be impossible to prove 
because all those nearby died in the explosion including hartwig 
but the detailed transcripts showed that the navy command that 
requested the experiments the naval sea systems command was the 
same agency that performed the tests that led to the navys 
conclusion about the cause of the explosion released earlier this 
month 
hartwigs family has requested a congressional investigation 
us rep mary rose oakar dohio who has consulted with the 
hartwig family said sunday she will hold a meeting in her 
washington office with navy investigators on monday to question them 
about the iowa report 
were concerned about the safety of the individuals aboard any 
of these battleships she said weve known for some time now 
there were some questions about that gunpowder it certainly 
appears they didnt continue their own investigation everything 
leads to asking them why they didnt conclude that some of it was 
their fault 
the 7007 pages of transcripts of navy investigators and 
interviewees was made available to the public but only at the 
pentagon and only for one day the day the official report was 
issued 
the transcripts showed iowa gunners were firing an experimental 
load from the no 2 turret with highstrength powder not approved 
for the weight of the projectile according to the transcripts the 
tests were designed to improve the accuracy and range of the ships 
antiquated 16inch guns 
the experiments involved the use of a bagged powder called delta 
846 with 2700pound projectiles that was in violation of warnings 
written in large letters on each container of d846 powder bags that 
said not to use it with the heavier projectiles because it would 
create too much pressure and heat inside the gun barrel 
apparently to avoid that the ships gunners were using five 
110pound bags of the powder instead of the normal sixbag charge 
the battleships commander capt fred b moosally told 
investigators that he did not know a fivebag charge was going to be 
used in the no 2 turret 
master chief sp skelly who had won a reputation throughout the 
service as a ballistics expert was in charge of the experiments 
moosally said skelly did not brief him on any of the experiments 
a lot of these things that im hearing about it seems to me 
they rightfully belong somewhere other than at sea at least until 
theyre approved through all the shore testing and directed to be 
conducted at sea moosally said 
the investigators pursued the possibility that hartwig who took 
over as gun captain in a lastminute roster change perhaps was 
confused by seeing only five bags of powder delivered at the breech 
instead of six and that in the confusion the powder bags were 
rammed into the barrel too quickly splitting a bag open and 
igniting the powder by the heat of friction 
the friction theory was eliminated by a series of tests under the 
direction of the naval sea systems command at the naval surface 
warfare center at dahlgren va the same command that encouraged 
the experiments with the d846 powder aboard the iowa 
but those findings contradicted all previous navy literature 
warning of ignition of powder bags by friction 
tests at dahlgren and other navy sites found that trace elements 
present in the breech of the center gun of the no 2 turret could 
not be found after firings with normal powder those elements were 
found however when a timing device and battery were inserted 
between the powder bags and the gun was fired 
the navy has suggested that hartwig could have inserted a timer 
into the powder charge 
however the investigation transcripts showed that the breech of 
the center gun was open at the time of the explosion and those 
trace elements could have been blown into the breech by the fireball 
that swept through the turret

television stars who usually shine at 
night came out for sundays annual emmy awards extravaganza in their 
glitziest garb while the sun shone brightly on a california 
afternoon 
its too bad said perpetual fashion gadfly mr blackwell 
if it was nighttime you couldnt see the dresses as well they 
would look better 
the glamorous women who adorn such tv hits as la law 
golden girls and murder she wrote chose either tailored 
elegance or shimmering sequins in a rerun of emmys past 
others came in everything from miniskirts to pants and one couple 
wore african costumes 
the head turner of the outdoor arrivals was jean kasem wife of 
casey kasem whose outfit featured 25 pounds of metal 
the creation which she said was titled metal mass was 
created for her by anthony ferrara it was topped off with a black 
helmet with rows of beads falling below her chin 
at least jean knows what being a star is all about said 
blackwell who turned thumbs down on most of the star dressing 
theres too much cheap glitz said richard blackwell who 
compiles an annual worstdressed list said theres nothing new 
no one can figure out what a fashion statement is this is probably 
one of the most eclectic masses of yesterday 
the fans who gathered across the street from the pasadena civic 
auditorium for the ceremonies appeared to share blackwells ho hum 
attitude they barely screamed at all when the stars stepped from 
their limousines 
in the middle of the fan gallery protesters from a religious 
group carried placards reading tv idols and idolaters repent 
perhaps the most unique outfit was worn by a costume designer 
paula glock who embellished her black minisuit with brass knives 
forks and spoons displayed down the front she called the outfit 
dinner for two 
in the crowd of fans some of the warmest applause was reserved 
for such youthoriented shows as the wonder years and growing 
pains as well as the stars of golden girls a show aimed at an 
older audience 
the golden girls estelle getty bea arthur betty white and 
rue mcclanahan were tastefully glamorous in a range of sequins and 
satins 
angela lansbury of murder she wrote showed up in a feminine 
version of a male tuxedo an outfit blackwell dubbed as passe 
i think the pants scene is over he said but i think she 
looked elegant from the hips up 
the standout according to blackwell was debbie allen who wore a 
dress with billowing black sleeves and a gold sash 
susan ruttan of la law wore a tight brocade minidress 
fashioned with a net pouf around the neck 
asked who designed her dress she said i did

changes in the soviet bloc are developing so 
fast it is impossible to tell were they will lead military 
specialists from the east and west blocs said at the end sunday of a 
threeday conference 
military analysts from warsaw pact nations were invited for the 
first time in 20 years to address the annual conference of the 
international institute for strategic studies iiss 
the general feeling was that the soviets want reform at least 
as much as they want order francois heisbourg director of the 
londonbased private institute said in an interview 
but continued disorder might spark the violent breakup of the 
soviet union heisbourg said citing opinions expressed among those 
present 
the 381 private and government military analysts discussed among 
other issues the consequences of soviet reform and negotiations 
between the superpowers heisbourg said it was institute policy not 
to disclose details of the closeddoor debate 
there is currently an atmosphere of detente said heisbourg 
a former defense advisor to the french government talks between the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact on 
conventional arms parity in europe were promising he said 
opinions ranged from very pessimistic to moderately 
optimistic among the specialists from 17 nations on soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs chances for completing his economic 
and political reforms he said 
the situation shifts so quickly that some authors said their own 
papers written two months ago were already out of date 
it is in everyones interest for reforms to succeed 
heisbourg said the bottom line is that it will be difficult and 
take a long time 
east bloc delegates acknowledged grave problems in the soviet 
union such as the ethnic strife in provinces wanting a stronger 
national identity heisbourg said 
nationalism and populism are symptoms of ailments but 
gorbachev is in charge there is no coherent opposition to challenge 
him 
the independent institute which was founded in 1958 and has 
about 3000 members from 76 countries studies strategic issues

businesses could help improve the souths 
infant mortality and low birth rate statistics by educating pregnant 
employees in prenatal care southern governors were told sunday 
the south continues to lag behind the nation with an infant 
mortality rate of 120 per 1000 live births compared with a 
national rate of 100 according to arkansas gov bill clinton 
chairman of the southern corporate coalition to improve maternal and 
child health 
joe taylor plant manager for sunbeam appliance co in coushatta 
la described his companys mandatory prenatal education program 
that began in 1986 after statistics for the previous two years 
showed 11 employees had premature babies that cost the company 2 
million in medical care 
the prenatal education program costs the company 10000 per 
year and in 1987 taylor said there were no premature babies born 
to employees in 1988 he said there was one premature baby that was 
hospitalized for only nine weeks 
weve saved a great deal of money he said noting that 
before the classes the company was spending about 25000 in health 
care costs per premature baby now the costs per birth are about 
3500 
conferees at the southern governors association annual meeting 
shared ideas on how businesses could help keep babies alive past 
their first year 
the association represents 17 states and two territories 
clinton said southern states are reducing infant mortality rates 
but low birth weight rates remain high although figures were not 
available low birth weight babies are those born weighing 5 pounds 
or less 
ill bet you the low birth rate is high because employees dont 
have the education i think its because we havent reached this 
employee population like we should he said 
clinton said he hopes to call a conference in arkansas late this 
year or in early 1990 to address the problems with business leaders 
and health care providers

for pepsi pop star michael jackson will make an estimated 65 
million in 1989 to remain the worlds highestpaid entertainer 
according to forbes magazine 
aging rock groups who were in their prime 20 years ago banked on 
reunion tours and a nostalgia wave to join forbes list of 40 
richest entertainers while some list perennials slipped a bit or 
dropped off entirely 
jackson made 125 million in 198889 to edge movie maker steven 
spielberg who made an estimated 64 million this year for a 
twoyear total of 105 million 
forbes which is publishing the list in its oct 2 issue said 
spielberg is getting a big boost from the videocassette release last 
year of his blockbuster film et the extraterrestrial 
dropping from second to third on the list was bill cosby the 
comedian turned television star and author who amassed some 60 
million this year and 95 million in 198889 according to forbes 
calculations 
jackson 31 who gained national attention at age 5 in the motown 
family combo the jackson five has made only two albums in the last 
seven years thriller in 1982 and bad in 1987 but reaps 
millions from sales and endorsements 
the androgynous singer announced after ending his bad tour in 
january that he would not perform on stage anymore 
forbes said jacksons last two records have brought in 100 
million three videocassettes since 1983 sold over 2 million copies 
the beatles music catalog he bought in 1985 makes him 3 million 
annually and his autobiography moonwalk has sold some 425000 
copies 
jackson also has a 9 million endorsement deal with pepsi 
although he made no new commercials for pepsi in 1989 and last 
week signed a deal worth a reported 20 million with shoe and 
sportswear manufacturer la gear 
each of the top three easily outpaced earnings for the bestpaid 
american corporate executives michael d eisner head of walt 
disney productions made 40 million last year followed by steven 
j ross of warner communications inc who had about 1416 million 
and richard l gelb of bristolmyers co with 1414 million

the architects of the channel one news show for 
schools say they have signed contracts that put them more than 
halfway toward their firstyear goal of raising 90 million from 
advertising on the program 
some channel one critics expected the controversy that erupted 
over a program that enables companies pitch products in the 
classroom would scare off advertisers 
but christopher whittle chairman of the knoxville tennbased 
media concern that created channel one said in an interview that 
some people have overestimated that issue 
the daily channel one television shows are scheduled to begin 
next march and whittle communications has been lining up sponsors 
for the past three months 
several national education groups and state education officials 
in new york and california have vehemently opposed channel one and 
some cable networks have begun offering adfree alternatives for use 
in schools notably a 15minute daily news show carried on turner 
broadcasting system incs cable news network 
whittle said friday that advertisers want to buy time on the 
12minute news shows not only because it gives them access to an 
often hardtoreach audience of young teens but to help schools 
revenue from the two minutes of ads on each channel one show will 
be used to pay the costs of producing the daily news program 
providing two companion educational network services and equipping 
each participating school with dozens of television sets a 
satellite dish and two videocassette recorders 
whittle said five companies have signed firm noncancellable 
multiyear contracts that will generate 51 million in ad revenue 
during the first year of channel one programming or 56 percent of 
the firstyear goal of 90 million 
he said those commitments indicate channel ones revenue will 
exceed that of any cable tv network during its first year in 
business 
including the first years revenue the contracts would generate 
1497 million in ad revenue over the first four years of channel 
one he said 
whittle declined to identify any sponsors but said they included 
four who had been in a sevenweek test of the channel one service in 
six schools last spring as well as one newcomer 
none of several of the channel one test sponsors questioned 
friday indicated whether they would advertise on it next spring 
procter amp gamble co which advertised two brands of shampoo 
potato chips deodorant and acne medication in the channel one test 
is still evaluating the program said spokeswoman kelly 
gillespie at the consumer product giants cincinnati headquarters 
levi strauss amp co the jeans maker from san francisco and wm 
wrigley jr co the gum maker from chicago have made no final 
decisions spokesmen said 
hans fiuczynski a spokesman for mampmmars in hackettstown nj 
said we do not discuss our future plans with the media the 
company pitched mampms and snickers candy during the channel one test 
the channel one producers are giving advertisers a chance to be 
the exclusive sponsor in 15 different product categories starting 
next spring 
whittle said the five companies already signed have locked up 
eight of those product categories the value of the multiyear 
contracts which run either three or four years ranged from 13 
million to 53 million he said 
whittle took several steps this summer to indicate that it is 
making progress toward getting channel one in operation 
it signed a 150 million contract with philips consumer 
electronics co based in knoxville tenn to make install and 
maintain the video system in the schools it named a panel of 12 
luminaries led by former education secretary terrell bell to advise 
the channel one programmers 
earlier this month whittle began an intensive effort toward 
signing up schools for the program 
whittle declined to say how many schools have signed up but said 
he is confident that the targets of 1000 schools at launch and 
8000 by december 1990 will be reached

the convention hall may be full of playpens and 
cribs pacifiers and cradles but there is little childs play at 
the 20th annual juvenile products manufacturers association trade 
show where companies come for showandtell in the 195 billion 
market in wares for the under3 gang 
there are even products that help combat yuppie guilt for being 
at work instead of at home with the kids 
now that baby boomers are having babies themselves the market has 
taken off spurred by the higher salaries of professional 
twocareer families who wait until later in life to have children 
also fewer children per family means more money per child 
association members said 
tastes also have changed with price often being of little 
object said shirley pepys the trade groups vice president and 
head of her own firm which makes coordinated nursery bedding and 
other infant products 
for example her noeljoanna inc which markets products under 
the nojo brand last year introduced a battenberg lace crib 
ensemble complete with elegant canopy the price about 600 
we just did it for fun mrs pepys said its turned into 
one of our best sellers 
such extravagance doesnt last long while theyll spend 600 
on the crib bedding which theyll use for two years they balk at 
spending 100 for a comforter for a bunk bed at age 2 
practicality takes over 
before then however parents will shell out the bucks 
frances blakey the associations director of public relations 
said studies indicate parents spend 30000 on a child up until age 
5 about 30 percent of all theyll spend before the child reaches 18 
and there are so many ways to spend it 
playskool baby inc a wholly owned subsidiary of toymaker hasbro 
inc has a threesided toothbrush among its abundance of infant 
care products many adorned with mickey mouse and kermit the frog 
to pitch during the show this weekend at the dallas apparel mart 
playskool is one of the large players in the industry 
manufacturing about six pieces of product for every birth in the 
country last year said president bob stebenne 
but mrs pepys said only about 20 of the 250 or so companies at 
the show have annual sales of 20 million or more most of the firms 
would be considered small businesses she said 
many of the companies were begun by parents who developed a 
product to meet their own needs and then recognized a wider 
potential mrs pepys said 
one such firm is decorate it inc whose president angel 
martinez said the companys wall decorating product was created 
out of pure need specifically to avoid lengthy redecorating of 
yet another room 
the system consists of a border and appliques with an adhesive 
that allows them to be pulled off and reapplied more frequently 
that anyone would every want to do it said martinez who is also 
a vice president of athletic shoemaker reebok international ltd 
also joked martinez kids and parents can do the redecorating 
together a way to alleviate yuppie guilt over not spending 
enough time with the children 
safety also has become a big issue in the industry cribs for 
example no longer have finial posts or other sharp edges but are an 
array of curves and rounded edges to prevent accidental cuts 
even bedding has been affected mrs pepys said noting that 
manufacturers have to be aware of the length of ties on crib bumper 
pads to prevent accidental strangulation 
the association has begun a certification program and hopes to 
make consumers more aware of which products have been given a jpma 
seal of approval

japan and the united states have agreed to start 
joint development of applications for the socalled fifthgeneration 
computer a japanese newspaper reported sunday 
the yomiuri shimbun said the cooperation will begin with the 
exhibition of japans multipersonal sequential inference psi 
system at a japanus symposium on artificial intelligence 
scheduled for oct 1113 in argonne ill 
the new system a prototype fifthgeneration or artificial 
intelligence computer built in november 1988 is the only one of 
its kind said yomiuri japans largest circulation newspaper 
the move is aimed at reducing friction between the two countries 
over advanced technology it said quoting unidentified sources at 
the ministry of international trade and industry 
at the symposium at the argonne national laboratory the two 
governments would begin using the new japanese system in specific 
research tasks under a us research program it said 
government officials could not be reached for comment sunday 
after the vacuumtube computer the transistorized computer and 
the integrated circuit computer the fourth generation computer 
includes supercomputers with very largescale integration circuits 
the immense calculating power of supercomputers is used for such 
tasks as helping meteorologists to predict weather oilmen to draw 
up intricate geological maps and chemists to test molecular 
combinations in the search for new drugs 
the fifth generation of computer with very very largescale 
integration circuits is envisioned as comprehending the spoken and 
written word perfecting languagetranslation systems and extending 
databases to knowledge bases a more complex system endowing 
computers with commonsense attributes 
in fifthgeneration computer science yomiuri said japan is 
considered far ahead of the united states france britain west 
germany and others in hardware all are developing this science 
under government projects 
leading the research in japan is the institute for new generation 
computer technology a think tank of more than 70 researchers 
established in 1982 under mitis guidance 
the equivalent of more than 1 billion in japanese government and 
corporate funds is going into the effort 
miti decided to let us national science foundation jointly 
sponsor the exhibition of the psi system after us scientists 
expressed interest in using the computer in genetic engineering 
yomiuri said 
us researchers said to be ahead of their japanese counterparts 
in genetic engineering are interested in using the psi computer 
because of its superior inferential ability it said 
yomiuri quoted anonymous miti officials as saying japanese 
scientists also could learn new genetic engineering techniques in 
the joint project
