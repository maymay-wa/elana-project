the united states curtailed spy flights 
focused on colombian drug traffickers after allegations that a us 
aircraft nearly collided with two colombian planes a newspaper 
reported tuesday 
the defense department scaled back the program under pressure 
from the colombian government which had approved the missions on 
condition they be kept secret the los angeles times reported 
citing unidentified sources 
information from the spy flights has been used in a colombian 
manhunt for pablo escobar the reputed head of the medellin cocaine 
cartel the times said 
the alleged nearcollisions became public in colombia on march 
29 when the pilot of an sam airliner was quoted by newspapers as 
saying the military aircraft had passed within several hundred feet 
of his plane over southern colombia sociedad aerea medellinense a 
subsidiary of avianca normally flies domestic routes and to 
central america 
the pentagon has said that a panamabased air force ec130 
flying at 18500 feet had been in the area on march 28 but denied 
that a nearcollision had occurred 
a spokeswoman for the us embassy in bogota lauren hale on 
tuesday told the associated press that the only us government 
flights in colombia had been to practice search and rescue missions 
with the approval of the colombian government 
she said the united states decided to suspend the flights to 
prevent any further misinformation 
unidentified sources told the times that the ec130 a variation 
of the c130 cargo plane that carries electronic surveillance 
equipment is based at howard air base outside panama city 
bush administration officials said they believe the us pilot 
erred by allowing his plane to be spotted but they said the 
alleged nearcollision may have been conceived by colombians 
sympathetic to the drug traffickers according to the newspaper 
the pentagon has since ordered its spy plane pilots to avoid 
detection over colombia one official said it was possible the 
pilots may have to stay out of colombian airspace altogether 
the orders are believed to affect the operations of 
oklahomabased air force awacs radar planes that monitor air 
traffic over colombia and attempts by the panamabased ec130s to 
pick up communications among drug traffickers 
administration officials said the cutback could hurt 
intelligence gathering but that they were determined to maintain 
cooperation with colombian authorities in the drug war 
there will be a limit on what we can do but the bottom line 
in the long run is that we have to work with the colombians one

presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro takes office wednesday already facing division in the 
ranks of her victorious coalition over government posts and 
treatment of nicaraguas outgoing sandinistas 
a source said late tuesday one of those outgoing sandinistas 
gen humberto ortega president daniel ortegas brother will 
remain in charge of the army but answer to mrs chamorro who as 
both defense minister and president will be supreme commander of 
the armed forces 
there are some extremists who want the sandinistas wiped out 
in one fell swoop the source close to mrs chamorro said 
describing some factions in the united national opposition that 
cant be he ortega will be eased out but not for a while 
keeping on gen ortega as army commander likely will heighten 
divisions inside mrs chamorros ruling coalition and make it more 
difficult for her to persuade the usbacked contra rebels to 
disarm contras and members of her coalition have demanded 
sandinista loyalists be purged from the army 
meanwhile in a show of support for the new administration 
congressional and administration sources in washington said tuesday 
that president bush will invoke emergency authority to send 26 
million in medical aid in time for mrs chamorros inauguration 
the maneuver gives vice president dan quayle the chance to 
deliver the good news as the united states top representative at 
the swearingin ceremony scheduled for 2 pm edt wednesday 
uno faces a test of unity in the national assembly while cabinet 
appointees due to be sworn in shortly after mrs chamorros 
inauguration have yet to be officially announced 
the 14party coalition brought together everyone from communists 
to conservatives in the successful effort to oust president 
ortegas sandinistas in power since 1979 
the first test came tuesday afternoon when the new national 
assembly met to elect a president unos official choice is myriam 
arguello a 64yearold lawyer from the peoples conservative 
alliance 
ms arguello earlier received 28 votes at a caucus of unos 51 
deputies to 23 for alfredo cesar a close adviser to mrs 
chamorro a former member of the contra rebels directorate and a 
man with his sights set on running for president in the 1996 
elections 
ms arguello is backed by vicepresident elect virgilio godoy 
and the sandinistas have hinted their 39 deputies might vote for 
cesar to encourage a split in uno ranks even though cesar is not a 
sandinista favorite because of his contra connections 
the legislatures opening session began as scheduled at 4 pm 
a noteworthy event that marked a new era in nicaraguan politics 
daneil ortega who has an assembly seat as a presidential 
candidate sent a message to mariano fiallos the supreme electoral 
council president who presided over the first assembly until they 
chose a president saying he would not be able to attend the 
legislative sessions until further notice 
lameduck vice president sergio ramirez who is ortegas 
alternate is expected to fill the role of minority assembly leader 
ms arguello was officially nominated for the presidency 
however a sandinista deputy made a motion for a secret vote a 
debate over the secret vote motion followed but the assembly went 
into recess late tuesday 
mrs chamorro who showed up 20 minutes after the session began 
and left after all the deputies got their credentials got a 
standing ovation from both sides of the aisle when she arrived and 
again when she left 
barricada official newspaper of the sandinista front ran an 
editorial tuesday saying the sandinistas would of necessity play a 
critical role in the emerging political landscape in this nation of 
35 million residents 
the sandinista front although it is not part of the new 
government and placing itself strictly within the terrain of a 
committed opposition cannot renounce playing the role of a 
national arbiter and a decisive force in the crisis from which the 
new government emerges the editorial said 
many in unos political council which represents the 14 
parties consider cesar an opportunist they fired him as campaign 
manager when both he and mrs chamorro were out of the country six 
months ago 
as soon as mrs chamorro returned she named cesar her personal 
adviser 
news on gen ortega wasnt entirely unexpected la prensa the 
chamorro family newspaper said monday the presidentelect would 
probably assume the defense ministry herself to avoid upsetting the 
uno council and high echelons of the sandinista peoples army 
mrs chamorros advisers have signed an agreement with the 
sandinistas that would depoliticize the sandinista army on monday 
the sandinistas announced army officers were stepping down from 
party posts that included humberto ortega one of nine members of 
the sandinista directorate 
radio corporacion a prouno radio station broadcast a callin 
show tuesday with citizens saying the electorate voted for a 
total change and all sandinistas must go 
many of the thousands of armed contras in the countryside also 
maintain that position and say they will not disarm as agreed by 
june 10 unless the army is purged 
meanwhile president carlos andres perez of venezuela arrived 
tuesday in managua for the inauguration other heads of state 
expected include presidents oscar arias of costa rica alfredo 
cristiani of el salvador guilio andreotti of italy and guillermo 
endara of panama

two thieves shot yeh yungchuan to death 
in front of other investors as he left the trading floor of a 
brokerage house with nearly 100000 crime has come to taiwan on 
the heels of affluence 
yeh a 32yearold accountant turned to run when the men 
stopped him they shot him once in the back and once in the head 
took his 25 million taiwan dollars and fled on a motorcycle parked 
outside 
such brutal crimes are becoming common wealthy businessmen hire 
guards and use bulletproof cars 
taiwan is not safe anymore said rebecca yen a 28yearold 
employee of a trading company most of my friends plan to 
emigrate 
increased violence stems from a getrichquick mentality on this 
island of 20 million people abetted by guns smuggled from mainland 
china officials say 
police said a record 5839 cases of violent crime were reported 
last year and they confiscated 9770 firearms more than the total 
of the previous five years robberies increased 39 percent and 
kidnappings 53 percent from 1988 they said 
violent crime has jeopardized our social stability said jaw 
shaukong a popular legislator who wore a bulletproof vest in his 
december election campaign we dont feel as secure as before 
president lee tenghui acknowledged increasing crime has had a 
grave impact on social stability and the peoples confidence in the 
nation 
onethird of entrepreneurs responding to an economics ministry 
survey said they had been targets of harassment or extortion by 
gangsters 
last year taiwans richest shipping company executive paid 
nearly 2 million ransom for his kidnapped 32yearold son who was 
released unharmed police later arrested three suspects and 
retrieved the money 
many of the 145 kidnappings reported last year ended tragically 
captors killed several victims after ransom was paid 
four masked men armed with israelimade uzi machine guns shot up 
ho cheng securities in changhwa central taiwan in march 
apparently because the company did not pay 12 million in 
extortion money 
i dont think we can do any business when our lives and 
property are unprotected said kao chingyuan a taiwan business 
leader it may be safer to move our business abroad 
emigration appears to be growing along with the crime statistics 
thanks to soaring crime our business doubled last year 
said cc tai of domini international consulting corp which helps 
people emigrate to australia new zealand and canada 
tai estimated that about 40000 taiwanese left in 1989 up from 
30000 in 1988 
luxury cars seen as invitations to kidnapping and robbery no 
longer are in demand 
eric fang assistant sales manager of the largest mercedesbenz 
agency said his company sold only 290 cars in december down from 
the 1988 monthly average of 650 and predicted a drop in sales of 
15 percent for 1990 
many businessmen have postponed purchases because they do not 
want to drive the dangerous cars he said 
authorities report a dramatic increase in smuggled guns from 
china police said they seized 687 chinesemade shotguns last year 
up from 57 in 1988 
official statistics say smuggled chinese guns were used in 91 
killings in 1987 including those of four policemen 
premier lee huan has proclaimed 1990 anticrime year and 
proposed that gun possession now punishable by 10 years in prison 
be made a capital crime 
thousands of inexpensive guns are believed to be in the hands of 
gangsters some legislators say the only way to stop the influx 
from the mainland is for the government to hold direct talks with 
beijing 
the ruling nationalists fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to the communists and still refuse to negotiate directly 
with the beijing government 
lin chiacheng a sociology professor at soochow university 
believes one reason for the crime wave is the widened gap between 
the rich and the poor 
taiwans exportled economic boom has made its per capita gross 
national product the fourth highest in asia but good fortune has 
not been shared equally the income of the top 20 percent is nearly 
five times that of the bottom 20 percent 
people also seem more inclined to seek quick riches than to work 
for a better life stock speculation has been the favored tactic 
but many have turned to crime 
traditional values have faded lin said fewer people 
believe in hard work and saving most envy those who have gotten 
wealthy fast from speculating and some think it is all right to 
get money from those rich people

art came to life at the paradiso 
nightclub as this years amsterdam tattoo convention got under way 
with the only inhibition in evidence a growing concern about aids 
swarms of male and female tattoobearers some halfnaked to 
show off their intricate body art clustered around tattoo artists 
creating firebreathing dragons and indian chiefs on their living 
canvases 
the convention drew tattooers tattoowearers camerabearing 
voyeurs and the justcurious from around the world with one samoan 
pricking his customer with traditional parallel line motifs from 
his south pacific homeland 
the convention which opened monday is the third organized in 
the last decade in this tourist mecca by the 55member dutch union 
of tattooers whose president henk schiffmacher runs the 
amsterdam tattoo museum 
usually tattoo enthusiasts can only get together in small 
groups this is mainly a social event said schiffmacher whose 
tattoos poured out of his modest tshirt 
by contrast 47yearold isobel varley of hertfordshire 
england posed topless with jack yount jr 63 of crystal springs 
fla to give onlookers a better view of their scenic torsos

forms of jewelry like nose rings 
yount who wears silver horns through his nose runs silver 
anchor enterprises specializing in exotic body jewelry and 
piercing by appointment according to his business card 
but taking centerstage were tattoos designs made by puncturing 
the skin with a needle and inserting indelible pigment 
despite the number of people who opted to get tattoos in the 
dozens of booths at the convention the sound was of conversation 
and cameras clicking not gasps of pain 
its a matter of meditating to bear the pain said 
schiffmacher 38 an increased awareness of aids was apparent among 
the practitioners and devotees of the sometimes bloody art painted 
with needles 
containers of sterilized needles at each tattoo artists booth 
evinced the amsterdam health departments toughened safety 
requirements since the last show three years ago 
every tattooist was required to wear gloves and use a freshly 
sterilized needle on each new client convention organizers 
provided sterilization facilities 
the safety precautions are stricter than ever said

conducting regular checks at the convention

syria long portrayed as the ogre in 
lebanon and the godfather of terrorist groups is making a 
highprofile effort to free american hostages and to improve its 
relations with the west 
the syrians clearly played a key role in securing the release of 
us hostage robert polhill on sunday 39 months after he was 
kidnapped in lebanon by shiite moslem militants 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa syrias point man in the 
campaign to free the westerners held in lebanon said im sure 
his release will pave the way for the release of the rest of the 
hostages 
seventeen westerners seven of them americans remain in 
captivity most of them held by shiite extremists in lebanon 
sharaa staked his reputation on the tugofwar between the us 
government and the iranianbacked shiites that led to polhills 
release 
when the kidnappers postponed the release because washington 
would not send a senior envoy to negotiate sharaa said the hostage 
would appear sunday 
polhill was turned over to us ambassador edward djerejian as 
scheduled 
syrias actions are part of a foreign policy strategy to move 
back into the arab mainstream after years of radical isolation and 
to seek better economic ties with the west 
syrias relationship with its traditional backer the soviet 
union is changing as moscow pursues detente and reforms at home 
leaving it little choice but to trim its sails to the winds of 
moderation 
the syrians clearly hope to improve their image in the west by 
being seen as the saviors of the hostages 
in return syria hopes to be taken off the us list of states 
that washington says sponsor terrorism and to reap the political 
and economic benefits from western countries who have shunned 
damascus in recent years 
countries on that list are denied us aid and credit 
diplomats said that getting off the us terror list would 
provide a muchneeded tonic for syrias beleaguered economy and 
provide political respectability to president hafez assads 
government in western eyes 
damascus would like to purchase everything from hightech 
computers to wheat from the united states at lessthancommercial 
rates 
improved relations would also ensure that syrias voice is heard 
at any ussponsored middle east peace talks 
toward that end assad reestablished ties with egypt in december 
to end a lengthy rift over cairos 1979 peace treaty with israel 
the united states and syria have already reached agreement on 
trying to bring peace to lebanon with both supporting the accord 
reached by lebanese parliamentarians in taif saudi arabia in 
october 
the accord which outlines a gradual withdrawal of syrias 
40000 troops from lebanon still gives damascus an important role 
in the affairs of its warshattered neighbor 
it is that influence that allowed syria to play the role of 
mediator between iran and the united states on the hostage issue 
arab news reports have said that assad hinged a state visit to 
tehran on hostage releases 
syria was irans main arab ally during irans 198088 war with 
iraq syrias main rival in the arab world 
iran depends on syria for access for its revolutionary guards to 
lebanon the only place outside the islamic republic where the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis shiite revolution has taken hold 
syria is the dominant military power in lebanon its troops are 
deployed in threequarters of the country 
so far it has not overtly used that muscle to force the shiite 
militants to hand over hostages apparently seeking to avoid an 
open confrontation with irans proxies that could ignite a wider 
conflict in lebanon 
the syrians have played a role in securing the release of 
hostages in the past because of their ties with tehran 
but their influence has increased since hashemi rafsanjani 
leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists who also seek improved 
ties with the west became irans president in july 
rafsanjanis power struggle with tehrans antiwestern radicals 
has been mirrored in a rift among the lebanese shiites and it was 
syrias ability to exploit that which apparently played an 
important part in polhills release 
there has been little american goodwill toward syria in the last 
few years 
washington recalled its ambassador to damascus in 1986 after 
britain broke relations with syria accusing syrian intelligence of 
sponsoring a plot to smuggle a bomb aboard an israeli airliner in 
london 
assad eventually expelled the palestinian group led by terrorist 
mastermind abu nidal which was linked to the abortive bombing and 
other attacks 
washington recently pressured assad to expel ahmed jibril 
leader of the damascusbased popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
western intelligence agencies list the group as the prime 
suspect in the bombing of a pan am jetliner over scotland in 1988 
that killed 270 people 
assad said he would act if positive proof of involvement in the 
pan am bombing was provided 
maybe the united states would overlook jibrils presence if 
syria helps get the hostages out a western diplomat speculated

dean kahler has only to look down to remember that day a rifle 
bullet made him a paraplegic and put him in a wheelchair for life 
i know why im sitting in it kahler said ill never 
really forget kent state 
kahler then a 20yearold freshman from canton ohio had 
worked nearly a year in a steel mill to help pay for school when 
rifle fire crackled over the shouts of his fellow students he fell 
to the ground to take cover he felt a sensation like a bee sting 
it was a bullet ripping into his spinal cord 
kahler a conscientious objector was the most seriously injured 
of the nine persons wounded he finished school seven years later 
then built a career in state government working for the secretary 
of state and attorney general he was elected an athens county 
commissioner in 1984 and reelected four years later 
kahler divorced in 1984 married a counselor he met in a pub 
last august he frequently drives the 340mile round trip to kent 
state for sports and alumni events he is a guest lecturer for a 
regularly offered course that examines the kent state shootings and 
their aftermath 
kent state is not something i carry around as a burden he 
said just because i had one bad day at kent doesnt mean the 
whole university should be condemned to me whats more 
important is the county budget and my family and the rest of my 
life 
but for sarah and martin scheuer much of their life died in a 
13second volley of gunfire 
it ruined our lives said scheuer now 79 and suffering from 
parkinsons disease 
as the seasons come and go so do may 4 wedding anniversaries 
unmarked uncelebrated nor can mrs scheuer bear the fragrance of 
springtime lilacs 
id like to bring them all inside i love them all so much 
sandy told her mother when mrs scheuer visited her apartment two 
days before she died those were the last words her mother ever 
heard her speak 
i try not to look at them said mrs scheuer it just 
makes me feel sad

that craggy silverhaired enigmatic sleuth 
played by john thaw is coming back to pbs mystery for another 
go at solving brainy murders in the academic confines of oxford 
england 
inspector morse an oxfordshire detective with a passion for 
puzzles returns for a third season on thursday may 3 
this is the 10th year for mystery which is hosted by diana 
rigg and presents such characters as john mortimers rumpole of 
the bailey agatha christies hercule poirot pd james adam 
dalgliesh and arthur conan doyles sherlock holmes 
the inspector morse series opens with the twopart mystery 
the settling of the sun in which morse and sgt lewis kevin 
whately of the thames valley police solve a revenge killing 
involving a group of foreign students attending summer school at 
oxford 
created by colin dexter the character of morse is harder to pin 
down than the crimes he compulsively tackles morse is a detective 
who leaps to conclusions very often the wrong ones but always is 
put back on the right path with the help of plodding sgt lewis 
hes a bachelor while lewis has a young family said thaw 
an english actor who was on a brief visit to this country at the 
end of the day lewis is anxious to get home when hes off the 
clock morse would work a 24hour day morse doesnt treat him too 
kindly he thinks he should put being a detective first its not a 
buddybuddy relationship 
the relationships not like holmes and watson where watson 
will come up with something that will change the whole case morse 
leaps from one theory to another and comes to the wrong conclusion 
at first lewis could come up with something obvious that gets him 
back on track 
morse lives alone and apart from police work is devoted to 
music crossword puzzles and drinking beer thaw calls him a sad 
man in a lot of ways 
the englishmade series funded by mobil is filmed in oxford 
around the colleges and the thames river its done entirely on 
location with no studio work later this year the show will film 
in australia where morse gets sent on a case 
most of the murders are committed by someone whos a friend 
thaw said there are no gangs or criminals mostly just 
oldfashioned murders that sherlock holmes was solving at the turn 
of the century 
were beginning to get out of the colleges he said i 
thought it was silly to have all the murders at oxford university 
i said i didnt want my daughter to go to oxford if they had that 
many murders 
the series is based on the novels by dexter who also was a 
leading creator of crossword puzzles he named his detective whose 
first name never is mentioned after sir jeremy morse chairman of 
lloyds bank and a friend whos also a crossword addict 
the episodes all are from dexters novels or from stories he has

aside from ketchupsplattered death 
threats this town that serves as the setting for the slightly 
surreal twin peaks tv series could hardly be more ordinary 
nothing could be further from snoqualmies real life than the 
hot new television series in which teenage drug dealers 
obsessivecompulsive housewives satanic cultists and others figure 
in the murder of a cocainecrazed homecoming queen 
i think you can describe this better as mayberry the quiet 
town in the old andy griffith show said baldwin galloway 
opening smokey joes tavern for the day its a pretty hohum 
town 
snoqualmie pronounced snowkwalmee a logging and tourist town 
of about 1500 residents 30 miles east of seattle in the foothills 
of the cascade mountains was the location for filming twin 
peaks and some locals got jobs as extras 
local reaction to the abc series has been mixed 
i love it the whole thing all the weird people the straight 
people and all said janine simmons tending the cash register at 
big edds drivein 
i dont know any weird people and ive been here 26 years 
she said were just having a lot of fun with it 
everyone just kind of laughs about it said rita lessard 
48 helping to arrange a display case at daves jewelry 
i havent talked with anyone that thinks its just 
wonderful she said i cant believe its getting good ratings 
the acting is horrid 
jean priestman 43 director of good neighbor child care at the 
methodist community church was undecided 
at first i thought it was a murder mystery then somebody told 
me it was a comedy she said 
in real life police are trying to identify the source of death 
threats against town council members who support weyerhaeuser co 
plans for a 2000home development 
investigators said the worst threat was last month against 
council member colleen johnson 
draped over her car was a bedsheet with threats like wear 
your vest a reference to the bulletproof vest she wears when 
working as a reserve police officer also on the sheet was a sketch 
of mount si with ketchup dripping from it and a trail of ketchup 
led from the car to her front door 
in general however its a sleepy little town said barbara 
harkey assistant principal at mount si high school 
ed lamb 48 a barber and lifelong resident who charges 8 for 
adults 7 for youngsters under 12 and seniors and 350 for beard 
trims said the first sign of notoriety for the town was a 
supermarket tabloid article that suggested it was infested with 
chain sawdueling maniacs the article was illustrated with a 
photograph of neighboring north bend 
lamb a volunteer firefighter for 28 years and others said they 
had never heard of anyone running amok with a chain saw 
before long however a sign outside big edds said please 
check your chainsaws in before entering on one side and twin 
peaks burger 285 little leaguers welcome on the other 
next door at valley saw amp lawn center the sign said buy 
your duelin chainsaws here 
aside from chain saw jokes residents say little has changed or 
is likely to change 
bookings have remained steady at the salish lodge near the top 
of the 268foot snoqualmie falls a 91room establishment that 
appears as a trysting place and scene of low intrigue in the 
series said general manager loy helmly 
there are no plans to use twin peaks in a marketing 
campaign said assistant manager stan kott 
we are thinking about having thursday night parties to watch 
the show kott said but thats fairly lowkey something more

dominating the dial is a key element 
of the sandinista game plan for postrevolutionary nicaragua 
the sandinistas have gutted the staterun radio network rather 
than turn the stations over to the conservative government that 
takes over wednesday 
they have also broken up their governmentowned network of 16 
advertising and publicity firms 
for the most part the radio stations and the publicity firms 
are now in the hands of sandinista loyalists 
party loyalists have also been given licenses for the first 
private television since the 1979 revolution 
members of the united national opposition transition team and 
the prerevolutionary owners of the radio stations are indignant 
so is nicaraguas only opposition paper la prensa which is 
published by presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro la prensa 
says the sandinistas are trying to leave intact their enormous 
propaganda apparatus 
when the sandinistas were the state they believed in state 
ownership and firm control of the mass media the 17station radio 
network and the chain of advertising firms were assembled from 
confiscated companies 
under sandinista rule nicaragua has had only two tv stations 
both of which are staterun and are to be turned over to the new 
administration 
the sandinistas also censored the media closing la prensa 
often sometimes for months at a time 
sandinista dominance of the media appeared to begin easing a bit 
last year when prior censorship ended the sandinistas also gave 
the opposition a bit of television time during the campaign 
after they lost the feb 25 election the sandinistas lifted the 
ban on private television and began moving to ensure themselves a 
firm grip on the public eye and ear 
they are trying to dominate the dial said frank arana a 
member of the uno transition team for media matters 
one of the new tv licenses went to the vehemently prosandinista 
publishers of the newspaper el nuevo diario which now sports a 
graphic of a television set on its masthead 
end tv18 in your home soon the legend on the tiny screen 
says 
another channel 4 will be run by a top sandinista official 
tourism minister herty lewites who said he also plans to start an 
airline 
meanwhile a new transmission tower has sprouted at what used to 
be the sandinista campaign headquarters the home of a new 
sandinista radio station radio ya radio now 
once radio ya begins broadcasting the party or party loyalists 
will control choice frequencies ranging from 600 to 840 on the am 
dial 
the uno transition team only learned last week that the 
staterun radio network had been dismantled arana said 
we were morally deceived he said but not surprised 
nicaragua has been rife with rumors and reports that state 
property was mysteriously evaporating in the wake of defeat 
the sandinistas insist they will hand over the machinery of the 
state intact but uno officials say that they wont know precisely 
what they are inheriting until mrs chamorro takes office wednesday 
uno doesnt even know whether there is enough money in the 
treasury to meet the state payroll at the end of the month mrs 
chamorros top economic adviser francisco mayorga said monday 
in the case of the radio network sandinista officials told the 
uno transition team that some of the radio stations were turned 
over to individuals and others to municipal officials 
barricada the sandinista partys official newspaper said the 
idea was to put the stations in the hands of people concerned 
with promoting culture and ethical values and morals that benefit 
the great majority and to ensure the continuation of 
participative radio and guarantee communication for ordinary 
people 
arana said the uno team hasnt been able to confirm who the new 
owners of the radio stations are but plans to investigate 
they were state property they cant just give them away 
arana said in an interview monday 
arana said the sandinista loyalists who worked for the state 
advertising and publicity firms are the new owners 
its not an isolated case things like this are happening in a 
lot of the ministries he said 
the sandinistas confiscated 66 privately owned radio stations 
after the revolution took over the government station la voz de 
nicaragua and turned ousted dictator anastasio somozas station 
into the sandinista partys radio sandino 
some of the stations were stripped of their equipment others 
were renamed many simply vanished only 17 were left when the 
network was dismantled after the election 
the prerevolutionary owners want their stations or what is 
left of them back said broadcaster mariano valle whose family 
lost 11 stations and plans legal action to claim its stations 
like the government tv stations la voz de nicaragua appears 
intact arana said

a winter of discontent has turned into a dry 
spring for new york republicans seeking a credible candidate to 
challenge democratic gov mario cuomo 
no major gop figure has been willing to step forward to take on 
cuomos expected reelection bid the new york democrat is widely 
viewed as a potential 1992 presidential contender should he survive 
the 1990 state election 
im not a kamikaze sen alfonse damato said last august as 
he became the first of many republicans to keep their hats out of 
the ring 
housing secretary jack kemp the former buffaloarea congressman 
who once quarterbacked the buffalo bills officially moved to 
maryland 
state assembly minority leader clarence rappleyea put on an 
im not running for governor campaignstyle button following a 
published report that he might be interested 
rudolph giuliani the former federal prosecutor who narrowly 
lost the race for mayor of new york city last year told party 
leaders to look elsewhere 
the 1986 republican candidate westchester county executive 
andrew orourke said he would need a frontal lobotomy before 
hed run again he suffered the worst defeat in modern new york 
gubernatorial elections 
its not that cuomo is invulnerable this is the third straight 
year of budget deficits for new york the second straight year of 
1 billion tax increases and the sixth straight year cuomo has been 
unable to deliver a budget by the april 1 start of the fiscal year 
at the end of march wall street dropped new yorks credit 
rating to its lowest level ever only louisiana and massachusetts 
were in worse shape 
proclaiming him loser of the week time magazine said 
cuomo is only one polluted harbor away from becoming the next 
michael dukakis 
it didnt matter new york republicans still couldnt find a 
candidate 
this is depressing me president bush said recently of the 
situation while admitting cuomo was a formidable political 
opponent the president said new york republicans should find a 
strong opponent for him 
shortly thereafter white house chief of staff john sununu 
telephoned former new york rep guy molinari to encourage the newly 
elected staten island borough president to challenge cuomo 
molinari said he was too busy with his new job 
meanwhile in neighboring massachusetts connecticut and 
vermont incumbent democratic govs dukakis william oneill and 
madeleine kunin all have decided against seeking reelection they 
also were facing severe state fiscal problems 
no such luck for new york republicans 
this is no time to be quitting as governor cuomo said 
earlier this month referring to new yorks fiscal problems and his 
reelection plans 
with the state gop nominating convention scheduled for the end 
of may the only announced republican candidate is littleknown

evan galbraith a former us ambassador to france who is 
chairman of the moethennessy champagne and cognac company had

this year was supposed to be different for republicans with the 
help of jonathan bush the presidents brother and other major new 
york republicans j patrick barrett was elected state gop chairman 
last june 
barrett a millionaire former chairman of the avis car rental 
company vowed to revitalize the party have a strong candidate for 
governor by the start of this year and build a multimilliondollar

last week the bipartisan state board of elections unanimously 
voted to investigate whether the state republican committee had 
intentionally filed an incomplete campaign finance report in 
january the filing failed to list the gop committees unpaid bills 
of more than 365000 that debt has since grown to about 750000 
according to party officials 
a recent gop fundraising event brought in about 115000 a 
third of what had been expected shortly thereafter barrett fired 
three state committee employees or onequarter of his entire staff 
meanwhile cuomos campaign bank account has grown to more than 
7 million and a recent statewide poll had the governors 
jobapproval rating at 62 percent the poll was commissioned by new

after concluding an aid agreement with the 
peruvian military to curb narcotics trafficking the bush 
administration is about to complete similar pacts with colombia and 
bolivia us officials say 
the 35 million aid package with peru was announced over the 
weekend in lima and will involve the peruvian military in the 
antidrug effort for the first time 
negotiations with the three andean countries have taken place 
since shortly after president bush announced his antidrug strategy 
last september and disclosed his intention to increase military 
cooperation with each country 
consistent with earlier announcements the colombian program 
will be 403 million and bolivias will be 337 million the us 
officials who insisted on anonymity said the signings of the 
agreements are imminent 
the united states will provide the peruvian military with 
training and refurbishing of aircraft some aid also will be given 
to the peruvian navy contrary to some reports there will be no 
us involvement in the construction of a military base but 
assistance will be offered in selecting a site for a new base the 
officials said 
the agreement signifies a renewal of us cooperation with the 
peruvian military which has had close ties with the soviet 
military for many years 
in contrast to bolivia where there is no significant 
insurgency the us programs in peru and colombia have a 
counterinsurgency component to them in addition to their principal 
goal of curbing narcotics flows 
in a letter earlier this month to rep dante fascell dfla 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee the state 
departments top aide for congressional relations janet mullins 
said 
while the ultimate purpose of the military assistance 
including equipment and training is to combat narcotics 
trafficking and production it is inevitable that counternarcotics 
activities will at times require counterinsurgency efforts to 
regain government control over certain areas 
among the principal backers of the coca leaf growers in the 
upper huallaga valley of peru are the shining path guerrillas the 
powerful leftist movement that seeks to bring about a 
workerpeasant state the valley is the source of the raw material 
for about half the worlds cocaine 
some members of congress including sen john kerry dmass 
have expressed concern that a us role in support of 
counterinsurgency operations in peru could get the united states 
involved in a civil war 
in response to those allegations state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler said monday that us military personnel will not 
participate in operations 
no additional defense department personnel will be stationed 
permanently in peru she said there will be rotating teams of 
defense personnel visiting peru during the next several months to 
conduct training particularly in connection with the new equipment 
agreed to by the government of peru 
ms tutwiler said that at any given time there will be between 
10 and 15 personnel working on various projects on temporary duty 
in peru

despite their apparent help in liberating 
american hostage robert polhill iran and syria will remain on the 
state departments list of countries that sponsor terrorism us 
officials say 
meanwhile in a series of messages passed to tehran by 
intermediaries the bush administration has notified iran it cannot 
expect an improvement in relations until all seven americans held 
in lebanon by proiranian militants are freed the officials said 
monday 
remaining on the terrorism list means iran and syria will 
continue to be deprived of us backing for international bank 
loans and sophisticated american technology 
the departments annual terrorism report is due to be released 
next monday it was finished two weeks ago before polhill was 
freed by the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
even so the report could have been revised but a us official 
said speaking monday on condition of anonymity we are not 
calling it back from the printers 
six countries in all are on the list besides iran and syria 
they are libya south yemen cuba and north korea the last change 
was the removal of iraq in 1984 
getting off the list requires a renunciation of terrorism and 
six months of good behavior among other tests the officials said 
iran and syria had not qualified 
president bush on monday called president hafez assad of syria 
to thank him for assisting in the release of polhill whose 39 
months of captivity in lebanon ended on sunday 
syria informed the united states that its ally iran also 
helped no details were provided to support the claim 
the administration in messages passed by switzerland algeria 
japan and other governments has informed iran over the last 
several months that release of the hostages would improve relations 
with washington us officials said 
iran in the meantime has said through intermediaries that it 
would like to improve relations and said a second hostage might be 
set free according to the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the exchanges were described by one official as 
intermittent continuing through the days before polhills 
release the us reply the official said was that all the 
hostages must be freed before the united states would renew ties 
with tehran 
the carter administration suspended relations in april 1980 
while 52 americans were held hostage in the us embassy in tehran 
iran is believed to have considerable influence with militants 
holding the seven americans in lebanon 
i hope the polhill release means something for the future and 
they got our message said a us official 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii said our 
hostages should be released unconditionally safely and 
immediately and this barbaric practice should end 
he made the statement in response to iranian demands that the 
united states exert influence on a christian group in lebanon to 
release iranian captives and on israel to free a proiranian shiite 
cleric abdul karim obeid seized last summer in lebanon 
we are not going to deal and were not going to negotiate 
baker said at a news conference we remain hopeful we will 
continue to call on the world community to do what they can to 
obtain the release of all hostages 
at the same time baker said we do not support 
hostagetaking i dont think hostagetaking serves any useful 
purpose 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that only the 
unconditional release of all american hostages would open the 
door towards better relations with iran 
he pointed to what he said were encouraging remarks by syrian 
officials and to a tehran times editorial saying all hostages ought 
to be freed 
but he also said the united states had no solid evidence that 
the release of polhill would necessarily lead to freedom for the 
other americans 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler when asked if 
officials had reason to expect another american would be set free 
said no we do not

federal drug policy chief william bennett is 
rejecting suggestions by the nations mayors for direct antidrug 
aid to their cities and for more emphasis on education and 
treatment 
bennett told mayors gathered for a conference on drugs and crime 
monday that it is too soon to redirect spending on drug enforcement 
and interdiction efforts to domestic prevention and treatment 
his remarks drew a blast from a frequent critic boston mayor 
raymond l flynn as wellintentioned but off the mark 
the choice for our young people cannot be either poverty or 
selling drugs said flynn a democrat an essential alternative 
has to be jobs and education as long as the white house continues 
to feel that the answer is in law enforcement alone at the local 
level the war will never be won 
bennett director of drug policy in the bush administration 
repeated the administrations opposition to sending federal 
antidrug money directly to cities rather than through the states 
many mayors contend the money isnt reaching them and want 
federal aid that bypasses the states but bennett said direct aid 
would create a confusing and disorderly hodgepodge and might 
slow the distribution of aid even more 
mayor bill harris of lincoln neb a democratic candidate for 
governor suggested a greater portion of federal antidrug money be 
spent on prevention efforts 
i think not yet bennett replied i wouldnt shift 
resources from interdiction yet 
the mayor of bogota colombia andres pastrana told his us 
counterparts that the war on drugs has brought havoc and bloodshed 
to his country 
he said colombia should respond to invitations for 
pleabargaining from colombian drug leaders known as 
extraditables who have offered to give up production and 
submit to colombian law 
if we continue to pursue the wild west model thousands of 
colombians and thousands of americans will die pastrana said 
the bogota mayor who himself was kidnapped and held for eight 
days in 1988 by drug kingpins said he supports proposals for 
finding a way to permit pleabargaining not now allowed in his 
country 
we have to decide which is best to gradually eliminate the 
production commercialization and sale of narcotics and the wealth 
they generate or to have the picture of a colombian national 
rotting in a miami prison pastrana said 
washington mayor marion barry awaiting trial on cocaine 
possession and perjury charges made brief mention of his own 
problem in welcoming the group 
he thanked the mayors for your sincere and deep honest 
prayers during my difficult time 
and believe me they have been answered barry said i 
feel better im back here in good spirits and high selfesteem 
clearer vision and glad to see a number of you 
barry later said he didnt feel uncomfortable addressing a 
conference on drugs despite his arrest and subsequent treatment 
for substance abuse at two clinics 
you assume a person is innocent until proven guilty and 
thats my attitude about all of this he said it will come out 
in the court im still the mayor

space shuttle discovery stood ready 
once again weather willing to ferry the hubble space telescope 
into orbit tuesday to seek answers to two questions how old is the 
universe and how big 
at the kennedy space center on monday officials expressed 
confidence the liftoff scheduled for 831 am edt will occur 
but there was little of the excitement of two weeks ago when 
hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families only to see 
the launch scrubbed with four minutes to go in the countdown 
here we are once again said william lenoir head of the 
national aeronautics and space administrations space flight 
program we think once again we are ready 
the unstable weather during launch preparations on monday was 
more of a concern than tuesdays nasa delayed by an hour the 
rollback of the service structure which had protected the shuttle 
from the elements 
loading of more than a half million gallons of hazardous fuel 
began at 1211 am tuesday as scheduled 
for tuesday there was the prospect of an hours delay for early 
morning fog but little else to worry about 
the crew of five commanded by loren shriver spent the day 
making last minute changes in flight plans undergoing equipment 
checks and relaxing one member steven hawley had a special 
reason for wanting the mission to begin on tuesday 
hawley holds the record among shuttle astronauts for climbing 
into the shuttle cockpit dressed for flight only to have the 
liftoff delayed on his first flight hawley underwent three 
scrubs on his second it was six times the aborted countdown on 
april 10 was his 10th 
since then another change has come to this seaside launch area 
for the first time since january 1986 and only the second time 
ever there was a shuttle on pads a and b in complex 39 
then too one of the shuttles was columbia the other was the 
challenger which exploded 73 seconds after launch because of a leak 
in its right booster rocket this time columbia is scheduled to 
make its 10th flight in midmay with another scientific payload 
the astro observatory 
for now it was discovery the shuttle on pad b that commanded 
attention 
the 15 billion hubble telescope the finest ever made is 
expected to give us a new set of eyes and ears said lenoir 
i cant say what we are going to learn but i will be astounded 
if we dont learn many new things 
lennard fisk the head of nasas science activities said 
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what 
the hubble will be able to accomplish 
the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better 
resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than any groundbased 
telescope and onehalf billion times more sensitivity than the 
human eye 
we are going to have the ability to observe the most distant 
objects in the universe and therefore among the earliest and 
therefore probe the secrets of creation he said we are ready 
to begin that new era in astronomy that hubble will usher in 
during the first launch attempt nasa and its contractors set up 
two huge tents at the press site and had experts on hand to 
describe their work on various aspects of the telescope the tents 
came down after the scrub the astronomers left and only a small 
cadre of experts was about 
the attempt was in the week before easter and many of the 
scientists had planned vacations around the event a milestone in 
astronomical research 
today i bring you only good news nasa test director al 
sofge said monday the launch vehicle is in good shape the 
hubble space telescope is in good shape the flight crew is ready 
and the weather looks good so at this point everything is 
go 
discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles the highest a 
shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper 
orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere hawley will guide 
the shuttles 50foot long crane as it lifts the 24250pound 
telescope out of the cargo bay and drops it overboard on the second 
day of the fiveday mission

budgetcutting pressures on capitol hill are 
making it more important for farmers to get a bigger income slice 
from the marketplace agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
for example he said a new spending package announced last week 
by rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee would hold spending on farm income support under federal 
commodity programs to 98 billion in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 
an administration budget plan sent to congress in january called 
for 102 billion a reduction of 15 billion from the increase 
that normally would occur if annual baseline spending trends 
were followed 
yeutter told a meeting monday of the national association of 
agricultural journalists that the administration and he in 
particular had come in for severe partisan criticism for the 
proposed 15 billion spending reduction 
the budget figures by panetta will be even harder for the house 
agriculture committee to reckon with because those amount to a 19 
billion cut from the baseline he said 
we now have a much different situation in farm legislation 
than we did a few days ago yeutter said 
however the situation also depends on whose baseline is being 
used the current usda baseline is 117 billion which was based 
on crop indications last fall thus a 15 billion reduction would 
be required to needed to lower fiscal 1991 spending to the 102 
billion cited by yeutter as the bush proposal 
the panetta figure of 98 billion was derived from a 
congressional budget office baseline of 106 billion computed as 
of february 
under that computation the panetta budget reduction would be 
only 800 million not the 19 billion yeutter said 
regardless of whose figures are used farm commodity programs 
are in for some more paring and yeutter made the point that it 
will be even more urgent for the united states to seek a favorable 
conclusion to the ongoing uruguay round negotiations under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade he said the gatt talks 
scheduled to conclude at the end of this year are aimed a 
liberalizing world trade 
the us position on agricultural trade calls for the gradual 
elimination of all tradedistorting policies and subsidies over a 
period of years 
yeutter said there is a feeling in some us agricultural 
circles that the gatt talks are being overemphasized and that 
farmers would be better off relying on congress to write generous 
price and income support provisions in the new farm bill 
but there will not be a lucrative price package in the farm 
bill yeutter said therefore farmers will have to generate more 
of their income from the marketplace 
were simply not going to have the flow of federal tax dollars 
into agriculture in the coming year that weve had in the past 
he said 
yeutter said a twoprice dairy plan approved last week by a 
house agriculture subcommittee has some very negative features 
and would put a heavier cost burden on consumers 
members of the house wheat soybeans and feed grains 
subcommittee also faced grim financial reality last week when 
panetta announced the budget figures 
the lawmakers plans for price supports would cost 16 billion 
more over the fiveyear life of the bill than the budget would 
allow committee staff said 
sections of the farm bill dealing with those commodities were 
put on hold until this thursday while the lawmakers find places to 
cut

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 149000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices for delivery next month under a longterm grain 
supply agreement 
christopher e goldthwaite acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said monday the wheat 
was sold by two private companies which will receive subsidies 
under the departments export enhancement program or eep

unions current eep allocation only wheat has been approved for 
sale to the soviets under the price subsidy program

than 32 million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and more than 
131 million tons of corn plus soybeans and soybean meal all of 
the wheat was sold under eep arrangements 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 149000 tons are equal to nearly 55 million bushels

the parents of a newborn who received the 
heart of her braindead twin brother may be able to take their 
daughter home within weeks 
alison paige whisman believed to be the first recipient of a 
heart from an infant twin wriggled on her hospital bed in pink 
booties monday as timothy and paula whisman watched a sonogram of 
their dead sons heart beating inside her 
she acts normal and is quite well said dr randall l 
caldwell id say her prognosis is good but all patients that 
have had a heart transplant you have to watch 
the baby called paige by her parents may be able to leave the 
riley hospital for children in 10 days to two weeks caldwell said 
her growth could be delayed some by the drugs she has to take 
said caldwell but she already has gained almost a pound from the 4 
pounds 13 ounces she weighed at birth 14 days ago 
their daughters progress is uplifting to the parents whose 
ordeal after their twins birth april 10 was a roller coaster 
ride and it was all downhill for about four days whisman said 
four weeks premature paige was born a minute before her 
brother tyler joseph and appeared normal tyler asphyxiated in 
the womb just before birth for unknown reasons 
the next morning paiges coloring changed tipping off doctors 
that she had a fatal heart defect while one child lay ill and the 
other brain dead on a lifesupport system mrs whisman wondered 
whether tylers heart could be transplanted into paige 
because the twins were not identical the chances of an organ 
match were uncertain the whismans who are roman catholics had 
their babies baptized during easter week as they waited for test 
results on their children 
on good friday whisman remembered he drove 20 miles home to 
cicero to work on the couples tax return and called back to the 
hospital to talk to his wife honey honey tylers heart is 
compatible he recalled her saying 
the next day tylers heart was transplanted into paige his 
liver was later transplanted into a 3monthold girl in wisconsin 
whisman said 
we needed a reason to let people know that tyler was here 
said whisman they said he was dead at birth but he lived long 
enough to help two children 
now the couple married less than three years say they are 
going to have to buy clothing for a girl although tylers gender 
was determined in the womb doctors did not know whether his twin 
would be a boy or a girl said mrs whisman 
so everything we have is either yellow or blue she said 
the whismans also look forward to the day when theyll be able 
to tell paige about her brother were very happy little tyler 
will be remembered said whisman she deserves to know about 
her brother

soviet economists participating in a unique 
conference with their us counterparts took an even gloomier view 
of their countrys economy than western experts according to the 
events chairman 
the range of opinion for the soviet group was somewhere 
between pessimism and depression as far as the prospects for 
turnaround for the soviet economy said nicholas eberstadt an 
american enterprise institute scholar who was conference chairman 
the soviet analysts offered grim pictures of their countrys 
standard of living the size of its economy relative to other world 
powers and the burden its military places on the overall economy 
eberstadt said 
and he said at least one irony emerged from the fourday 
meeting soviet officials chiding the central intelligence agency 
for being taken in by soviet propaganda that overstated the 
countrys economic performance 
it was the sense of the group that the old official soviet 
estimates are not plausible he said 
the meeting was the first at which highlevel soviet economists 
have held frank exchanges with their us counterparts 
the conference report reinforced a downbeat view of the soviet 
economy released last week by the cia in congressional testimony 
agency deputy director for intelligence john helgerson called the 
economys 1989 performance abysmal and cited price increases 
and shortages of consumer goods 
although comparisons between market and nonmarket economies are 
difficult at best soviet economist victor belkin estimated his 
countrys gross national product is only 14 to 28 percent that of 
the united states that would rank it as low as eighth in the 
world behind the united states japan west germany france great 
britain italy and perhaps even india 
official estimates by the cia have ranked the soviet economy 
second after the united states putting it at about half the us 
gross national product of 53 trillion 
another soviet analyst vladimir tikhonov said his countrys 
agricultural statistics substantially overstate soviet food output 
meat production is barely half the officially reported figure he 
said grain output in 1988 was less than 140 million tons rather 
than the 195 million officially reported 
oleg bogomolov another conference participant put soviet 
military spending at 20 to 25 percent of gnp roughly 200 billion 
rubles a year that compares with the 77 billion rubles officially 
reported the cia estimate has been 15 percent 
the soviet level of military burden is more or less what north 
koreas is which means that it is a highly militarized society on 
a war footing eberstadt said 
another soviet researcher yuri dykhanov said the living 
standard of soviet citizens averages about 20 percent that of the 
united states the cia puts the figure at onethird the us level 
the idea that the soviet living standard might be as much as 
onethird that of the us standard struck the soviet group as 
utterly fanciful eberstadt said 
the soviet union is beginning new research in cooperation with 
austria and west germany aimed at finding better more accurate 
measures for its economy he said

the internal republican party debate over 
abortion is heating up with formation of a grassroots drive to 
eliminate the strong antiabortion plank from the party platform 
ann stone a conservative activist said monday that republicans 
for choice has recruited more than 200 gop officeholders as part of 
its 3 million drive to elect prochoice delegates to the 1992 
convention 
our party will face defeat in the 1990 congressional and 
gubernatorial elections said a prospectus mailed by the group to 
republicans around the country president bushs reelection 
could even be endangered 
stone who described herself as prochoice and prolife 
said she had no expectation that the man expected to dominate the 
1992 convention president bush will change his position 
our party is a big tent and george bush and all of us sit 
under it she said 
if the drive fails to get the convention to put prochoice 
language in the 1992 platform stone said she would try to drop 
abortion from the document 
the 1988 platform said that the unborn child has a fundamental 
individual right to life which cannot be infringed we therefore 
reaffirm our support for a human life amendment to the 
constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the 
fourteenth amendments protections apply to unborn children we 
oppose the use of public funds for organizations which advocate or 
support abortion 
but in the 1989 elections held months after the supreme court 
gave states far greater leeway to place restrictions on abortion 
republicans lost races for governor of virginia and new jersey 
contests in which the gop candidates were attacked for their 
antiabortion views 
stone who said she personally opposes abortion contended that 
the party would suffer far greater losses this year and in 1992 
unless it changes its position 
the 1988 republican national platform included a righttolife 
plank that we believe is not representative of a majority of 
republicans or most americans said the groups prospectus 
the document went on to cite the 1989 elections as proof that 
this position on abortion is dangerous politically and will cost 
us the votes of many traditional republicans as well as the vote of 
a majority of young voters 18 to 35 
the three goals cited were to fight to change the platform 
elect prochoice republicans as delegates and to fight efforts 
within the republican national committee or within state republican 
committees to force our party to oppose the option of legal 
abortion 
leslie goodman a spokeswoman for the republican national 
committee said we certainly would advocate people getting out 
there and working both sides of the issue we think there is a 
dialogue that needs to take place 
but she declined to speculate on whether the platform might be 
changed 
i cant even look that far ahead she said 
the group claims more than 200 recruits for its advisory board 
including reps tom campbell of california nancy johnson of 
connecticut and jim kolbe of arizona 
stone has her own directmail fundraising firm and has long been 
active on behalf of conservative candidates and causes 
she said her views on abortion had never been known because no 
one ever asked me 
she said she didnt oppose the partys shift to an antiabortion 
position at the 1980 convention because that was what the nominee 
ronald reagan wanted 
i voted for him and i worked hard for him she said

the government and home builders and groups of 
the handicapped are split over whether proposed guidelines 
guaranteeing disabled people access to new apartments would price 
many of them out of housing 
a task force formed by the national coordinating council on 
spinal cord injury and the national association of home builders 
said monday that the guidelines would put new apartment rents out 
of reach of many low and mediumincome people including the 
handicapped 
if design guidelines result in significant increases in the 
cost of housing then we have defeated the purpose of the fair 
housing amendments act of 1988 and created another barrier to 
accessibility said r jack powell president of the spinal 
injury group and executive director of the paralyzed veterans of 
america 
but gordon mansfield assistant hud secretary for fair housing 
and a former paralyzed veterans official contended in an interview 
that the guidelines are within congress intent and would add only 
1 percent to apartment rents 
housing and urban development secretary jack kemp has 
instructed us to pay attention to affordability and probably 
what we are proposing is less than the home builders said 
mansfield a paraplegic from a spinal cord injury suffered in the 
vietnam war 
bonnie milstein cochairman of the housing task force of the 
consortium for citizens with disabilities agreed she said the 
task force on handicap accessibility set up by the home builders 
and spinal injury group is basing its estimates on expenditures not 
required by the fair housing amendments 
congressional amendments to the fair housing act require hud to 
insure that disabled people have easy access to new multifamily 
apartments first occupied after next march 13 
the guidelines involve such things as the width of doors and 
halls the size of bathrooms and walkin pantries and the grading 
and ramping of steeply sloped sites 
the home builders and spinal cord council contended that the 
proposed guidelines will increase significantly the cost of 
apartment construction further slowing an already depressed 
multifamily industry and exacerbating the affordability crisis 
currently confronting millions of low and moderateincome 
households 
powell told a news conference at national association of home 
builders headquarters that the cost of meeting the proposed 
guidelines would range from 1300 to 3700 for walkup units and 
from 3200 to 4250 for mid to highrise apartments 
that cost he said will be passed on to consumers resulting in 
monthly rent increases of 13 to 37 for walkup units and of 32 
to 43 for mid or highrise units 
but mansfield said the hud guidelines would increase the cost of 
a 50000 apartment by just 1 percent or 500 which both hud and 
the handicap accessibility task force agree is within the cost that 
congress intended 
in addition to the disagreement over the effects of the new law 
the uncertainty over the guidelines has severely disrupted the 
multifamily construction industry said kent w colton executive 
vice president of the home builders 
he said the industry finished 1989 with only 373000 building 
starts down nearly 50 percent from 1985 and the lowest level since 
1975 
mansfield said the draft guidelines are being considered by the 
office of management and budget which much approve many government 
regulations before they take effect 
we would like to see the guidelines as soon as possible he 
said 
the home builders group is a federation of more than 800 
construction associations with more than 157000 members the 
coordinating council is composed of 17 organizations associated 
with spinal cord injuries of which the largest is the paralyzed 
veterans of america 
the consortium includes in its membership united cerebral palsy 
the american foundation for the blind and the easter seal society 
all three organizations supported the fair housing amendments

a collection of political havenots is out to 
accomplish collectively what its members couldnt do individually 
defeat the powers of congressional incumbency 
our country is suffering from an imperial permanent congress 
it is a congress that cannot solve the problems we have 
complained paul jurgens a decatur ill republican who ran 
unsuccessfully for the house in 1988 
he was one of more than three dozen past and current 
congressional challengers who gathered monday on capitol hill to 
call for a political housecleaning 
our federally elected officials have so rigged the process 
that they are impossible to unseat said harold coker a 
chattanooga tenn republican and losing candidate in 1988 
that complaint was the central theme at a meeting of the 
coalition to end the permanent congress a grassroots organization 
formed out of frustration with the 1988 elections in which 985 
percent of house incumbents won reelection 
coalition members from at least 18 states advocated a long list 
of reform proposals among them were a ban on taxpayerpaid mass 
mailings by members of congress prohibiting lawmakers from 
accepting honoraria or speaking fees eliminating political action 
committees which contribute mostly to campaigns of incumbents and 
imposing a 12year limit on how long members can serve in the house 
and senate 
lionel kunst a kansas democrat who helped found the group 
urged coalition members to return to their states and vigorously 
push the issue of congressional reform among voters 
this thing is hot right now we can make a greater impact 
said kunst 
the group has met about a half dozen times in other cities since 
its first gathering last year in kansas city mo 
the coalitions latest assault on incumbency came as the senate 
prepared to consider legislation to overhaul the system of 
financing congressional campaigns but kunst denounced the 
legislation as pablum and said it would do little for 
challengers

fear of racial violence has swept anew through 
perus 60000member japanese community since alberto fujimori the 
son of immigrants stunned the nation by rocketing from unknown to 
presidential frontrunner 
people of asian descent including the large chinese community 
have increasingly been threatened insulted in public and denied 
entry to restaurants since fujimoris surprisingly strong finish in 
the april 8 vote 
for many its a nightmare relived 
fifty years ago just before the outbreak of world war ii in the 
pacific juan iida watched mobs loot the homes and businesses of 
japanese peruvians 
it was the worst experience of my life said iida the 
77yearold founder of the japaneselanguage daily newspaper peru 
shimpo i dont even want to think about it happening again 
antijapanese fever peaked with a recent statement by sen 
enrique chirinos soto a spokesman for rival candidate mario vargas 
llosa he said peru is not ready to have as president a 
firstgeneration peruvian 
vargas llosa dismissed the spokesman and decried the racial 
incidents people in other circles including outgoing president 
alan garcia and limas roman catholic archbishop have also spoken 
out against the hatred 
fujimori an agronomist born of japanese parents won nearly 30 
percent of the vote in the april 8 balloting to 32 percent for 
vargas llosa forcing a runoff backed by leftofcenter voters 
the political independent is expected to prevail over the 
conservative novelist in voting expected in early june 
fujimori is as peruvian as i am and as you are vargas llosa 
shouted at supporters who chanted antijapanese slogans outside his 
home the night after the election even so some critics have 
accused members of his centerright democratic front coalition of 
deliberately fanning the fires of racism to cut into fujimoris 
support 
it was a primitive response by frustrated people said 
amelia morimoto hayashi of the japanese peruvian cultural center 
however in the long run it may be vargas llosa who suffers if 
race becomes an important issue in the campaign according to some 
analysts 
eightyfive percent of perus population is indian and mestizo 
another 5 percent is black 
in addition vargas llosa is viewed by many as part of the white 
caste that has traditionally ruled this andean country from coastal 
lima an urbane man he lived and wrote for 16 years in europe 
before returning to peru in 1974 critics accuse him of being out 
of touch with peruvian reality 
the final stretch of the campaign revealed the racist and 
class character of vargas llosas entourage said fernando 
rospigliosi a columnist for the independent news magazine caretas 
indeed rospigliosi said fujimoris success so far has stemmed 
in great measure from deeply rooted antiwhite prejudices the 
high vote obtained by fujimori can be explained in part in my 
opinion by the racial factor 
fujimoris own reaction has varied with the moment 
sometimes he has joked some people fear that during my 
government they will have to eat with chopsticks he said soon 
after the elections 
later he blamed the racial outbursts on certain discontented 
groups that are making use of whatever weapons available to create 
problems 
fujimoris own campaign may actually have helped bring the 
racism to the surface 
throughout the race he played on peruvians stereotype of 
orientals as hardworking and honest he has repeatedly 
referred to himself as el chinito the little chinaman 
many voters thus came to view him as a foreigner and this 
worked largely in his favor public opinion polls show that voters 
regard foreigners as less corrupt and more efficient than peruvians 
racism has long played a part in perus history perus 
television stars and news announcers are generally white as are 
people in most advertisements the winner of the miss peru pageant 
invariably is white 
the maoist guerrilla known as the shining path is to some extent 
an outgrowth of antiwhite sentiment among the quechuaspeaking 
indians of perus highlands 
most japanese peruvians are the children of preworld war ii 
immigrants who came to work on coastal plantations most later 
moved to cities and many started their own businesses 
on may 13 1940 dozens of their stores and homes were looted by 
mobs driven by antijapanese war propaganda most businesses that 
survived the looting were seized later by the government 
more than 1400 japanese peruvians were deported to camps in the 
united states where other japanese americans were detained 
after the war most japanese peruvians had to start over with 
nothing many spent the next four decades just trying to 
integrate to become peruvian so it wouldnt happen again ms 
morimoto says 
most japanese peruvians have been successful many own large 
businesses and factories others are doctors lawyers and 
engineers 
but the memories remain 
what i fear most is that mr fujimori will not make a good 
government which is a very difficult task in peru today said 
61yearold gerardo maruy retiring president of the japanese 
peruvian association 
the same people who thought him a miracle worker said 
maruy will be the first to turn against him and against us

i yam what i yam says popeye the sailor 
man but the peaceloving quakers dont like his brawling ways and 
object to the use of the cartoon character in ads for quaker oats 
not only that toot toot but olive oyl is too submissive say 
members of the religious society of friends better known as the 
quakers a longtime champion of womens rights 
popeye began popping up last year in tv commercials and in 
comics inserted in instant oatmeal packages dispatching his 
nemesis bluto with a swift swing of an oversized forearm 
i eats me oatmeal and im stronger than steel im popeye the 
quaker man he sings to an adoring olive oyl 
elizabeth foley spokeswoman for the philadelphia yearly 
meeting the biggest quaker group in the east said monday they 
had popeye resolving dispute and conflict through violence this is 
completely obnoxious and offensive 
we are an organization of pacifists we have a peace testimony 
that is more than 300 years old she said to portray us as a 
church that beats up on other people is not ok 
quaker oats co which has no connection with the religious 
group apologized and said it deleted the phrase popeye the 
quaker man from commercials which ran through the oatmeal 
season september through march 
references to popeye the quaker man will be taken out in 
future printings of the comics in oatmeal packages the 
chicagobased company said 
obviously we looked at it as a humorous way in which to 
promote the product and certainly never intended to create any 
controversy said company spokesman ron bottrell 
however he said quaker oats hasnt decided whether to drop 
popeye as a spokesman 
in chester county near philadelphia quaker children at the 
willistown monthly meeting first day school suggested an 
alternative plot 
they have popeye and bluto coming together and saying our 
fights have never resolved anything lets try something new 
lets work together for the betterment of all foley said and 
they build a homeless shelter 
paul hendricks who edits the popeye strip for king features 
syndicate said the concept of bluto and popeye working together 
isnt too farfetched 
i think itd fly as long its not saccharine sweet itd be 
ok hendricks said basically popeyes a nice guy he just 
beats up on bad guys

whereabouts were unknown even to university officials

impossible as it sounds a food scientist says 
hes invented just what the worlds been waiting for ice cream 
thats good for you 
not only does this stuff contain almost no fat it might 
actually lower the bodys cholesterol level instead of raising it 
the secret ingredient is a fluffy white powder made from that 
darling of the food conscious oat bran its principal inventor 
george e inglett of the us department of agricultures research 
labs in peoria ill calls it oatrim 
if his predictions are correct in two or three years it will be 
an ingredient in all sorts of otherwise highfat foods including 
mayonnaise cheese spreads salad dressings and margarine 
it has a double whammy inglett said it will replace 
animal fat such as cream in desserts and it acts in the body to 
lower blood cholesterol 
to be successful oatrim will have to compete against other fat 
substitutes that have been under development longer and it will 
have to overcome doubts that have arisen about the powers of oat 
bran to lower cholesterol 
the first of the substitutes called simplesse was approved by 
the food and drug administration last month it is made from egg 
whites and milk protein others made by kraft and procter amp 
gamble are also under consideration by the fda 
whether oat bran actually lowers blood cholesterol was called 
into question by a study conducted last year at brigham and womens 
hospital in boston doctors concluded that cholesterol levels fall 
when people eat lots of oat bran but only because they are too 
full to eat highfat foods that raise cholesterol 
oatrim is produced when enzymes are used to remove watersoluble 
fiber from oat bran or oat flour when mixed with water it takes 
on the consistency of cream cheese but has almost no taste 
inglett unveiled his product monday at a meeting of the american 
chemical society he handed out samples of english muffins covered 
with an oatrim cheese substitute it was sweet and bland with a 
mild taste of cheddar cheese 
while he did not show off oatrim ice cream he said that in 
taste surveys people rate it between ice milk and ice cream when 
whipped up by a softserve machine tasters describe it as 
delicious excellent wonderful and marvelous he said 
in one respect it is clearly different four ounces of fancy 
premium ice cream contain about 300 calories 22 grams of fat and 
85 milligrams of cholesterol oatrim ice cream has 135 calories 
virtually no fat and four milligrams of cholesterol 
no studies have been done to see what effect the product has on 
peoples cholesterol however dr rosemary k newman of montana 
state university tested it on chicks and found that it lowered 
their cholesterol levels 18 percent 
it certainly was effective in chicks she said im 
excited about it as a food for people 
oatrim cannot be used as a fat substitute in baked goods such 
as cookies because it loses its fatlike consistency when heated 
inglett said oatrim powder could also be stirred into powdered 
breakfast drinks to provide the same amount of oat bran fiber as a 
bowl of oatmeal 
instead of eating your oatmeal he said theres no reason 
why you cant drink it in the morning and then youre off to 
work

cuba says there are no plans for pope john 
paul ii to visit the communist caribbean island nation in december 
contradicting a weekend announcement by the vatican 
papal spokesman joaquin navarro said sunday as the pope wound up 
a trip to czechoslovakia that the polishborn pontiff would visit 
cuba in december before christmas though not date has been set 
but the official cuban news agency prensa latina on monday 
quoted the foreign ministry as saying there is no such plan for a 
papal visit the dispatch was monitored in mexico city 
the vatican last year accepted an invitation to visit from cuban 
leader fidel castro in march while on a visit to brazil castro 
said a visit by the pope was practically agreed upon 
however he also criticized the catholic church in cuba at that 
time saying it should dedicate itself to the people instead of 
assuming an antirevolutionary position 
the pope encouraged the toppling of unpopular communist regimes 
in eastern europe and is now warning that regions newly freed 
peoples to be wary of what he calls the spiritually impoverished 
materialism of the capitalist west 
castro has staunchly defended his brand of communism and the 
improved living standards it has meant for cubans refusing to 
embrace free market reforms encouraged by mikhail s gorbachev

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
denounced the alleged us kidnapping of a mexican doctor to face 
charges in the slaying of a narcotics agent declaring you do 
not uphold the law with illegal acts 
the mexican president delivered his attack on us actions below 
the border at mondays annual luncheon of the associated press in 
century city the luncheon followed the news cooperatives annual 
meeting 
the meeting and luncheon attended by publishers and editors 
representing the aps 1486 newspaper members were the openingday 
events at the 104th annual convention of the american newspaper 
publishers association 
salinas who arrived under heavy guard pointed to mexican 
arrests and convictions of 28 defendants in the 1985 slaying of 
us drug agent enrique camarena as proof that mexico needs no help 
in apprehending the guilty 
dr humberto alvarez machain who was brought to el paso texas 
on april 3 from guadalajara mexico is one of 18 people under 
indictment in the camarena murder 
a federal judge in los angeles has demanded an explanation of 
how alvarez came to the united states if the doctor was kidnapped 
salinas said the incident could undermine the international 
drugfighting effort 
this runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who 
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem 
much larger than the one we are trying to combat salinas said 
the mexican government has complained about the arrest of the 
gynecologist alleging the us drug enforcement administration 
offered money for the kidnapping and may have been in on the actual 
plot 
alvarez is alleged to have been present when camarena was 
tortured and murdered at a guadalajara house prosecutors allege 
that the doctor gave camarena drugs to revive him for additional 
torturing before he was killed 
the battle against narcotics traffickers requires 
unprecedented international cooperation salinas said 
but that cooperation in order to be effective and real has 
to be accomplished with the strictest international respect and no 
unilateral action against the law and rights of other nations he 
said it is not with arbitrary acts by the pursuers that we are 
going to combat the illegality of the narcotics traffickers 
us attorney general dick thornburgh has called for an 
investigation into the doctors arrest 
dea officials have denied allegations by alvarez lawyer robert 
k steinberg of los angeles that his client was kidnapped by 
bounty hunters who were paid as much as 100000 
the ap annual meeting included a report to the membership by 
william j keating chairman of the aps board of directors and 
louis d boccardi president and general manager of the ap keating 
is chairman and publisher of the cincinnati enquirer 
boccardi said that ap technology is advancing to meet the needs 
of its growing membership now at a record level 
aps electronic darkroom which will replace the current photo 
reception system is on schedule and meeting preproduction testing 
goals boccardi said 
fullscale installation of the ap leaf darkroom is to begin in 
september after summer fieldtesting an installation schedule is 
to be announced in june he said 
boccardi compared the new technology for electronic handling of 
photos to the computer terminal revolution in handling words he 
said it will mark a major step forward for newspapers 
we will train your staff and aps service reliability will 
stand behind the ap leaf darkroom it is the right step at the 
right time boccardi said 
he noted that darkrooms from sources other than ap could be used 
with the ap leaf which will fully conform to anpa standards 
other technological advancements are imminent boccardi added 
by july 1 the ap expects to complete the conversion of its 
entire highspeed system to deliver ap and supplemental copy to 
members at 9000 words a minute boccardi said 
a customized stocks service that allows members to localize 
market table pages is in print in a dozen member newspapers and 
the installation schedule for selectstocks will be accelerated 
through the rest of the year he said 
boccardi touched on the plight of terry anderson aps chief 
middle east correspondent who was taken hostage in lebanon five 
years ago last month 
we continue to search for an end to his ordeal and pray that 
recent optimistic comments will lead to his release boccardi 
said 
also at the meeting on monday david j whichard ii of the 
greenville nc daily reflector was elected to the board of 
directors of the associated press and five incumbents were 
reelected 
they were james k batten chairman and chief executive officer 
of knightridder inc based in miami j stewart bryan iii

shares on the tokyo stock exchange made up some of 
their early losses but ended lower tuesday while the dollar edged 
up against the japanese yen 
the dollar finished trading at 15815 yen up 060 yen from 
mondays 15755yen close it opened at 15788 yen and ranged 
between 15785 yen and 15815 yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average which was down 33366 points 
at the end of the morning session narrowed its loss to 17769 
points or 059 percent in the afternoon ending the day at 
2950138 
on monday the index lost 15637 points 
the nikkei index began recovering in the afternoon as market 
players began buying issues of suzuki motor co following a report 
that the company has invented a new substance to detect the aids 
virus said kazuhiro nomura a trader with new japan securities co 
there was little incentive to sell in the afternoon he 
added 
toshiyuki nishiguchi a trader with daiwa securities co 
attributed the morning decline to an upswing in japanese government 
bond yields as well as the markets waitandsee mood ahead of a 
week of holidays that starts apr 28 for most japanese companies 
the price of the benchmark no 119 10year japanese government 
bond fell to 8601 tuesday morning from 8617 monday that raised 
the yield to 7365 percent from 733 percent 
nishiguchi said the nikkei fell as much as about 340 points 
within one hour during the morning when arbitrageurs sold spot 
issues in an attempt to take profits from price gaps between the 
spot and the futures markets 
but after that the index stopped falling any further partly 
because there was no marketaffecting news to move in either 
direction after a series of sellings nishiguchi said 
other traders said the the yens weakness against the dollar and 
a decline on the new york stock market overnight depressed the 
nikkei 
in currency dealings the dollaryen rate was moving narrowly 
after the higher opening which followed overnight gains by the 
dollar on overseas markets said minori takeuchi a dealer with 
chemical bank in tokyo 
the yen also weakened in tandem with the west german mark 
against the dollar she said but the dollar failed to rise 
further because many investors are inclined to sell it around the 
158yen line she said 
many players sold marks against the dollar following mondays 
announcement by west germany that salaries and pensions denominated 
in east german marks would be converted to western marks at a 
oneforone rate takeuchi said the plan was more generous than 
west germany had indicated previously and has aroused concern about 
the possibility of higher inflation in germany

a seriously ill elizabeth taylor 
battled pneumonia at her hospital her breathing assisted by a 
ventilator doctors say 
hospital officials described her condition late monday as 
stabilizing after a lung biopsy to determine the cause of the 
pneumonia analysis of the tissue sample was expected to take until 
thursday said her spokeswoman chen sam 
the 58yearold actress who won bestactress oscars for 
butterfield 8 and whos afraid of virginia woolf has been 
hospitalized more than two weeks she was in the intensive care 
unit at st johns hospital and health center 
she is seriously ill her doctors said in a statement 
after surgery her breathing is now being assisted by a 
ventilator her condition is presently stabilizing and her 
physicians are pleased with her progress 
another spokewoman for the actress lisa del favaro said miss 
taylors family was at her bedside she did not identify the family 
members 
miss taylor entered daniel freeman marina hospital on april 9 
with a persistent fever and sinus infection doctors said her 
condition worsened and she was transferred april 16 to st johns 
and moved into intensive care on friday 
it is serious but they are really pleased with her progress 
shes not well shes not on her deathbed or anything ms sam 
said late monday 
while it is unusual to put a pneumonia patient on a ventilator 
it does not mean that person is near death said dr john g 
mohler a university of southern california lung disease expert who 
emphasized he had no direct knowledge of miss taylors condition 
doctors may put a patient on a ventilator simply to restore 
oxygen in the blood to proper levels if pneumoniarelated breathing 
difficulties have reduced those levels mohler said 
it may be that because she is such a prominent person they 
are taking a conservative course he added 
miss taylor has been plagued with health problems for years 
particularly back troubles from filming of national velvet in 
1945 when she fell off a horse 
in 1983 she acknowledged a 35year addiction to sleeping pills 
and painkillers miss taylor has been treated for alcohol and drug 
abuse at the betty ford clinic 
during a nearly fatal bout with pneumonia in 1961 miss taylor 
underwent a tracheotomy an incision into her windpipe to help her 
breathe she appeared at the 1961 academy awards with a bandage 
over her scar as she accepted the butterfield 8 oscar

a muledrawn wagon carried the rev ralph david 
abernathy to his final resting place as his colleagues praised him 
for shouldering the burden of the civil rights movement for the 
past two decades 
the famous and the humble crowded shouldertoshoulder into a 
church monday for the fourhour service for the martin luther king 
jrs chief lieutenant and closest friend abernathy died of a 
heart attack april 17 at age 64 
state rep tyrone brooks said abernathy was nailed to the 
cross in his efforts to hold kings coalition together after the 
civil rights leaders assassination in 1968 
the assassination of ralph david abernathy began on april 5 
1968 brooks said he was crucified for 22 years 
afterward two mules pulling a wooden wagon bearing abernathys 
casket set out from west hunter street baptist church where 
abernathy was pastor for lincoln cemetery 
kings body was carried to its resting place by a muledrawn 
wagon in 1968 at the suggestion of abernathy who considered it 
symbolic of humility family members said abernathy wanted the same 
for himself 
groups of people some with children and pets lined sidewalks 
as the wagon inched along amid 150 marchers including abernathys 
sons kwame and state rep ralph david abernathy iii and civil 
rights associates andrew young and jesse jackson 
more than 3000 people were on the cemetery grounds waiting to 
file through a chapel there to touch the casket and lay flowers 
beside it before it was placed in a mausoleum 
at the chapel mourners cheered as one of abernathys daughters 
donzaleigh abernathy bosley told them her fathers last words 
were im alive im alive im alive forevermore 
some of abernathys colleagues who had branded him a judas 
months ago for writing of kings alleged marital infidelity in his 
memoirs were themselves rebuked during the funeral 
brooks said the civil rights movement should be proud instead of 
embarrassed by abernathys autobiography and the walls came 
tumbling down 
brooks a student activist during the 1960s stood in the pulpit 
above abernathys rosecovered coffin and waved a copy of the book 
he urged the crowd of 2500 to read it 
it was not a mistake brooks said it is the truth all 
636 pages 
among those present were kings widow coretta scott king and 
three of her children benjamin hooks head of the naacp us rep 
john lewis dga robert kennedy jr and health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan 
jackson said abernathys accomplishments far outweigh any 
disagreement that came as a result of his memoirs 
one cannot judge a player by one exceptional play nor can 
a player be judged by an error jackson said ralph abernathy 
is in the hall of fame we must pay homage and thanks 
ralph david abernathy iii his voice breaking with emotion 
compared his father to the bibles david saying he slew the 
goliath of racism 
i am the son of a giant slayer he said

derrick bell harvard law schools first 
black tenured professor is threatening to take a leave of absence 
without pay until a black woman is added to the faculty 
bell who first taught at what is considered the nations 
premier law school in 1969 was expected to announce his leave 
today said keith boykin a spokesman for the student coalition for 
civil rights 
students at the law school have been staging protests demanding 
more minority faculty members harvard law has five black 
professors three of them tenured out of a faculty of more than 
60 bell said monday 
i cannot in good conscience continue in a role that limits 
rather than expands faculty diversity he said in a statement for 
release today i cannot continue to urge students to take risks 
for what they believe if i do not practice my own precepts 
prior to the noon rally at which bell was to make his 
announcement he and the law school administration were to hold 
talks over the hiring of a black woman bell said harvard has only 
five female law professors none black 
bell and the student coalition are urging the school hire regina 
austin a black woman who is a visiting professor at harvard 
austin has been offered a permanent post at the university of 
michigan boykin said 
bell is a former member of the student nonviolent coordinating 
committee a civil rights group he first taught at the law school 
in 1969 but left in 1980 to become dean of the university of oregon 
law school 
bell returned to harvard in 1986 as the law schools only 
tenured black professor 
last may during student sitins to protest what they called a 
lack of diversity on the faculty some students pushed to have bell 
named dean of the law school 
bell put the number of minority students at the school at 400 
with fewer than 200 of those black harvard law school has about 
1500 students 
the students have been urging greater diversity i guess its 
been happening in many other places around the country he said 
monday 
thus far there has not been very much in the way of positive 
response to demands given the administration a couple of months

an agreement that would provide dependents of 
migrant workers with government health care in mexico has been 
signed by the mexican government and the united farm workers 
the pact was signed by ufw president cesar chavez and ricardo 
garcia sainz director general of the mexican social security 
institute in the presence of mexican president carlos salinas de 
gortari 
salinas was in los angeles on monday to speak at the annual 
associated press luncheon 
it has not been possible for the union to protect members 
families in mexico with the unions medical plan here chavez 
said now with this pact they are able to get universal medical 
care at a very reasonable price 
chavez said he had worked on the proposal for 17 years and 
believes at least 100000 dependents of migrant workers will be 
covered by the mexican government in the first year of the 
agreement 
the worker the spouse the children and workers parents or 
grandparents in their absence will be covered chavez said each 
worker will pay between 160 to 200 a year to help defray the 
health care costs in mexico he said 
the services will include primary health care specialists 
surgery hospitalization dental and vision care obstetrics 
medication xray and other diagnostic tests 
this places on us the responsibility to respond with work 
with determination with the full recognition that the wellbeing 
of their families rests on our shoulders and that we must always 
watch over it garcia said 
with the protection which the social security will give to 
their families wherever they may live the quality of life will be 
enhanced and great opportunities for development will be opened 
he said 
chavez said the agreement will be extremely beneficial to 
thousands of workers who legally cross the border into the united 
states for work daily and who are not covered in mexico 
i think this will be a good thing if it works said migrant 
worker ramon perez who has a wife and two children in morelia 
mexico about 200 miles northwest of mexico city 
right now we send them money any chance we can so they can 
buy food and clothes and for medical care said perez who was 
among 50 ufw workers who witnessed the signing of the agreement in 
a hotel conference room

veterinarians undertook an emergency 
caesarean section on a 36yearold asian elephant but the 
266pound calf was removed dead 
officials at the burnet park zoo said monday they werent sure 
why the calf a male died 
the position of the calfs head had prevented the mother babe 
from delivering naturally making the csection necessary 
until the fetus came out of the uterus it was a coin toss 
said zoo director dave raboy who gave the goahead for the 
fourhour operation monday by a medical team from cornell 
university and zoos around the country 
the 7700pound babe would have been been the oldest firsttime 
elephant mother to give birth in a north american zoo she went 
into labor wednesday 
it was the third csection tried on an asian elephant and only 
one of the operations was successful said zoo spokeswoman yvette 
pelletreau 
in preparation for surgery burnet park had gathered two 
kingsize mattresses a oneton chain hoist to lift the calf and 
two fiveton chain hoists to lift babe 
the zoo world followed babes pregnancy because of the rarity of 
captive births by asian elephants an endangered species that 
numbers fewer than 45000 in the wild there have been just 62 
births in captivity

yellowstone national park after thousands of gallons of fuel leaked 
from underground tanks 
the order monday came on the day that began what the churchs 
spiritual leader says is a 12year dark cycle of global danger 
and catastrophe from which the shelters are to protect 750 
followers 
the order requested by the state friday bars the church

nomura said 
but trading was thin with first section volume estimated at 480 
million shares up from 330 million the previous day 
toshiyuki nishiguchi a trader with daiwa securities co 
attributed the indexs early decline to a rise in japanese 
government bond yields as well as the markets waitandsee mood

mark against the dollar after west germanys announcement monday 
that salaries and pensions denominated in east german marks would 
be converted to west german marks at a 1for1 rate in the planned 
monetary unification dealers said 
but the dollar did not rise quickly as many investors sold the 
currency for profittaking at around 158 yen said hisashi 
matsuda a dealer with daiwa bank 
he said some investors bought dollars based on news of growing 
oil shortages in lithuania caused by a soviet economic embargo but 
most market participants were more interested in eastwest german 
developments the dollar is considered a safe investment refuge in 
times of economic or political uncertainty 
the mark is still attractive to many investors because of 
expectations of higher west german interest rates in the near 
future dealers said

premier li peng the first chinese head of 
government to visit moscow in 26 years met today with mikhail s 
gorbachev after stressing that both countries have the right to 
tailor reforms to their own needs 
lis fourday trip is meant to promote good relations and ease 
border tensions at a time when both countries longtime rivals for 
leadership of the communist world are confronted with serious 
domestic problems 
on monday the 61yearold premier noted in a speech at a 
kremlin dinner given in his honor that the soviet union and china 
share a 4300milelong border 
both are socialist countries and conduct reform and 
perestroika in accordance with the realities of their countries 
peng said in remarks reported by tass the official soviet news 
agency 
he went on to tell the dignitaries gathered in the grand kremlin 
palace that his country was committed to developing friendly ties 
with the soviet union despite differences 
the reality in china and the soviet union are different and 
both sides have dissimilar views on a number of questions he 
acknowledged 
peng did not identify the areas of disagreement but western 
diplomats in beijing said china has stressed it will never again be 
the docile soviet ally it was in the 1950s and they noted that 
chinas suspicions of soviet aims have grown with gorbachevs 
reform policies 
the ideological hardliners who now rule china reportedly blame 
gorbachev for the fall of communist regimes in eastern europe and 
see perestroika gorbachevs reform program as leading to the 
demise of socialism 
li was expected to hold at least two rounds of talks with 
gorbachev who went to china in may it was the first visit by a 
soviet leader in three decades 
tass said on this trip the two delegations would sign an 
agreement on cooperation through the year 2000 in nuclear energy 
space exploration wood processing agriculture and metallurgy 
gorbachevs historic visit to china was overshadowed by 
studentled prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing which ended 
weeks later when li and other chinese leaders sent in troops to 
crush the movement 
in moscow gorbachev now is contending with the crisis in 
lithuania which declared independence march 11 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences in 
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969 in 1972 china restored 
relations with the united states in part because thenleader mao 
tsetung saw the soviet union as chinas most serious military 
threat 
the last chinese premier to visit moscow was lis foster father 
chouenlai who met soviet leader leonid brezhnev in 1964

east germanys health minister says his 
country will contribute 36 million to an israeli foundation that 
provides psychological counseling for holocaust survivors 
the announcement came monday as east germany ended two days of 
remembrance for the six million jews killed by nazis during world 
war ii 
we remember in this moment that six million jews were murdered 
in germanys name health minister juergen kleditzsch said in an 
address to nearly 400 people in east berlins synagogue rykestrasse 
the uniqueness of the murder of the jews which defies 
comparison or settling of accounts poses an obligation for the 
politics of our country he said his government would contibute 
36 million toward the establishment of an east german committee 
of israels amcha foundation which provides counseling for 
holocaust survivors 
for decades communist east german governments refused to accept 
responsibility for the holocaust saying communists fought against 
the nazi regime and had themselves been victims of nazi persecution 
but on april 12 the countrys first freely elected parliament 
said the state was prepared to make reparations to holocaust 
victims and urged the establishment of diplomatic ties with israel 
west germany has apologized for nazi atrocities and paid about 
497 billion in reparations to jews 
israel has demanded that east germany likewise accept moral 
responsibility for the holocaust and agree to pay reparations 
before diplomatic relations can be established 
holocaust remembrance day began sunday when jews around the 
world gathered to mourn the death of the six million

five astronauts boarded discovery 
today for a second try at sending the hubble space telescope into 
orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to 
the beginning of time 
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of 
what the hubble will be able to accomplish said lennard fisk 
head of nasa science activities 
air force forecasters said there was a 90 percent chance the 
weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the 
scheduled time of 831 am edt 
more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen were pumped into the space ships fuel tanks after midnight 
the astronauts wearing bright orange flight suits climbed into 
the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the kennedy space 
center 
the 15 billion telescope nasas costliest cargo will give 
astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have said 
william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
its going to change our perspective altogether i cant say 
what were going to learn but ill be astounded if we dont learn 
many new things 
discovery was aiming for an altitude of 380 miles the highest a 
shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper 
orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere it is the 35th 
shuttle mission 
columbia which journeys into space next month with the astro 
observatory sat on a launch pad 16 miles from discovery only the 
second time both pads have been occupied the first was in 1986 
just before the challenger explosion 
hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983 
delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident the 
latest postponement occurred april 10 when discoverys launch was 
scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit 
on the shuttle 
the mood at the kennedy space center was considerably less 
festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of 
astronomers gathered with their families 
the day after launch mission specialist steven a hawley will 
use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the 24250pound telescope 
into space veteran spacewalkers bruce mccandless ii and kathryn 
sullivan will assist if a problem develops 
discovery will follow hubble from 40 miles away for two days 
until after its lens cap is opened exposing the finely polished 
945inch mirror to starlight 
hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by 
satellite for a month or more after liftoff however nasa said it 
will release its first image an open star cluster in the 
constellation carina a week after launch 
in addition to the 15 billion cost of hubble 500 million has 
been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software 
to operate the instrument the european space agency contributed 
250 million for 15 percent of the viewing time 
nasa estimates it will cost 200 million a year to operate and 
maintain the telescope in space 
during its 15year working lifetime the telescope will provide 
astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more 
sensitivity than groundbased observatories as a result they will 
be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been 
traveling toward earth for 14 billion years 
astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created 15 
billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery 
surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars hubble also is 
expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end 
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble 
who discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding his 
work gave rise to the big bang theory that the universe was created 
by a tremendous explosion 
in addition to hubble discovery carries a human skull filled 
with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts 
receive it is the skulls third trip into space 
the shuttle is to end its fiveday mission with a landing at 
edwards air force base calif

president mikhail s gorbachev has ordered special 
flights this year for moslems who want to travel to saudi arabia 
for the annual pilgrimage to mecca a government spokesman said 
mondays announcement was the latest move by the soviet 
leadership to placate the countrys 50 million moslems a group 
that has become increasingly strident as it grows in size 
the soviet union has no diplomatic relations with saudi arabia 
but foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has been asked to 
contact the saudi government make final arrangments for the flights 
and visas said presidential spokesman arkady maslennikov 
speaking at a briefing for foreign journalists on monday 
maslennikov said gorbachev had asked aeroflot the soviet carrier 
to arrange special flights from moscow kazan baku tashkent and 
other cities in soviet central asia for the moslem pilgrims 
millions of moslems from around the world make the hajj 
pilgrimage to mecca during the annual rites that take place in late 
june and early july 
however only a handful of soviet moslems have been allowed to 
make the hajj in past years usually specially selected worshipers 
and not on direct flights to the oilrich kingdom 
there have been outbreaks of violence between moslems and 
christians in the soviet union most notably in territorial 
disputes between the republics of armenia and azerbaijan militant 
azerbaijanis have rioted along the nearly 500mile border with 
iran demanding reunification with their ethnic brethren in 
northern iran 
since the 1979 revolution in iran soviet officials have 
expressed concern about islamic fundamentalism creeping across the 
border however in 1989 the kremlin agreed to foster contacts 
between religious leaders in the soviet union and those in iran 
maslennikov said diplomatic relations between the soviet union 
and saudi arabia were not necessary for the special arrangement 
but if diplomatic relations are established in the future i 
would consider it to be of mutual benefit to both sides 
saudi arabia and moscow had full diplomatic relations until 
1938 when dictator josef stalin closed his embassy in a 
costcutting move several attempts during the 1980s to 
reestablish ties faltered over what saudia arabia called a 
belligerent attitude toward soviet moslems

presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro will also take over as defense minister when she assumes 
power on wednesday according to her familys newspaper 
the paper la prensa said the move would calm the spirits 
of both the ledership of mrs chamorros coalition and the 
sandinista armys high command which would find it very 
difficult to swallow the naming of another person 
questions have persisted about whether the sandinistas who 
dominated the countrys political life for a decade until their 
defeat in feb 25 elections are truly willing to forgo control of 
the military and security forces 
on monday the sandinista front said in a statement that defense 
minister humberto ortega had quit the partys ninemember 
directorate 
that left open the possibility that the brother of outgoing 
president daniel ortega might be allowed to remain army chief 
the sandinista statement said that all other officers in the 
sandinista peoples army and the interior ministry which controls 
security forces had quit leadership posts in the party 
a march 23 agreement between mrs chamorros advisers and the 
sandinistas banned military officers from holding posts in 
political parties at the same time the incoming administration 
agreed to respect the professional status of the sandinista 
army 
the idea was to prevent the sandinistas from keeping control of 
the military the contra rebels who have been fighting the 
sandinistas for nine years have resisted demobilizing unless the 
army is purged of sandinista functionaries 
leaders of the usbacked rebels have agreed to heed mrs 
chamorros call and disband by june 10 but there is some dissent 
in the ranks 
many contras have expressed fear that the presidentelect will 
not have firm authority over the army that the latest changes will 
not remove the army from sandinista control some contras want 
their officers to replace sandinista officers which could lead to 
conflict with stillmilitant sandinistas 
an estimated 9000 contras are inside nicaragua and are expected 
to move into ceasefire zones where they are to turn in their 
weapons under un supervision 
in mondays report la prensa listed the makeup of mrs 
chamorros cabinet which it said was chosen on sunday during a 
daylong closed meeting of the leadership of the presidentelects 
united national opposition coalition uno 
the newspaper said the ministers would include enrique dreyfus 
the former president of the superior council of private enterprise 
as foreign minister antonio lacayo the presidentelects 
soninlaw and close aide as presidential minister and carlos 
hurtado as interior minister 
others listed were francisco rosales as labor minister silvio 
de franco finance jaime cuadra agriculture gilberto cuadra 
construction and transport sofonias cisneros education ernesto 
salmeron health silviano matamoros social welfare and francisco 
mayorga central bank president 
an official announcement of cabinet positions was expected later 
today 
that cabinet will inherit an economy in shambles that was hurt 
over the years by a nowended us embargo and ineffectual 
sandinista policies inflation last year was 1800 percent and the 
foreign debt is 7 billion 
further complicating the task is the absence of consensus on how 
to approach such problems among leaders of uno a coalition of 14 
parties spanning the political spectrum and generally united only 
in their preelection desire to topple the sandinistas 
the sandinistas who received 40 percent of the vote in the 
february elections are still the countrys biggest single 
political party 
nicaragua has been ruled by autocratic and oppressive 
governments much of the time since it gained independence in 1821 
today outgoing president daniel ortega said of political 
changes in nicaragua i am happy because we are forging a 
democratic process that was not previously known in nicaragua 
but in an interview with nbc he said leaving office was tough 
it does hurt not so much for me but for my party 
there are some people who believe we gave up too much but 
it seems to me that only time will tell if what i have done as 
president was correct ortega said

millions of ravenous mormon crickets so big 
and barbedlegged that they stick in the craw of predator birds 
have invaded nevada in the worst infestation since the 1930s 
worrying ranchers and farmers 
the federal government has joined the battle to protect the 
regions alfalfa but had to postpone the start of aerial spraying 
monday because of rain 
i got my own guy out there killing crickets because i dont 
want to wait for the government to help said eldon crawford a 
rancher near golconda whose fields sit below canyons thick with the 
insects which can grow to the size of a mouse 
ive had them for the past three years but this is the worst 
i dont know how strong theyre going to get theyre just babies 
now 
the insects cover some 700000 acres in five counties of 
northcentral nevada in the worst infestation since the 30s with 
crickets counted at 100 per square foot in the worst areas near 
winnemucca said dick rowe coordinator for the nevada department 
of agricultures plant industry program 
rowe said the crickets are about three quarters of an inch long 
but will grow up to two inches within the next month as they start 
a hungry march across nevada eating everything in sight 
they havent damaged any cropland yet he said but the 
federal government is putting on another crew to poison them within 
a couple of days right now things are looking good but it can 
very easily get out of hand pretty quick 
several dry winters and a lack of natural predators the 
crickets get caught in the craw of gulls and other birds created 
perfect conditions for the infestation experts said 
the juicespitting insects which can bite humans if disturbed 
got their name from an infestation in utah in the 1800s legend has 
it gulls from salt lake city ate the crickets to save the area from 
destruction 
for the past couple of weeks the state agriculture department 
has spread poison bran bait near hatching sites at the mouths of 
canyons near winnemucca 160 miles from reno 
martin larraneta department district chief said ground and 
aerial poisoning should control the crickets 
the idea is to stop them before they get to the farms and come 
into town he said i dont think itll get that bad 
george nash head of the federal animal and plant health 
inspection service plant disease and quarantine operation 
estimated it would cost 15 per acre for control measures 
farmers and ranchers will pay half the cost on private land the 
us government which controls most of the affected land will 
pick up the tab on public property

a photograph of the late singer john 
lennon showing him nude and in a fetal position was pulled from an 
art exhibit by museum trustees who said it clashed with the shows 
theme 
the portrait taken in 1980 by photographer annie leibovitz 
shows the exbeatle next to his wife yoko ono who is fully 
clothed trustees at the cityowned muckenthaler cultural center 
decided to remove it from an exhibit that opened saturday 
beverly gunter chairwoman of the centers board of trustees 
said monday the trustees decided the work was not appropriate to 
the exhibits theme heroes heroines idols and icons 
it doesnt express hero it expresses antihero gunter 
said to me to fit the hero show something about the work 
should be somehow a character strength 
the contemporary arts center in cincinnati and its director 
dennis barrie have been indicted on misdemeanor obscenity charges 
for an exhibit there of photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
that include homoerotic images and naked children 
i realize it might raise some questions but it has nothing to 
do with the mapplethorpe issues gunter said monday i was just 
trying to think of the appropriateness of the show it only had to 
do with a question on content of the show and my criterion was the 
theme 
norman lloyd the shows curator said he wanted to include the 
lennon photograph because it illustrated an argument by the late 
philosopher joseph campbell that the process of maturing is itself 
a heroic act 
it shows john lennon in a very vulnerable position lloyd 
said its basically that he hasnt grown up its a very elegant 
photograph and shows that struggle people have of breaking away 
a portrait of the late artist keith haring nude but covered 
with body paint that matches the background was included in the 
show 
the muckenthaler show includes artwork by 25 artists including 
thomas hart benton andy warhol and jasper johns 
fullerton is a city of 110000 people about 25 miles southeast 
of los angeles in affluent orange county

orders to us factories for durable goods 
jumped 67 percent in march the sharpest increase in two years 
the government said today 
the commerce department reported that orders for durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last at least three years 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 1288 billion in march following a 
23 percent upward bounce in february 
it was the largest increase in orders since a 74 percent gain 
in december 1988 and it continued for a second month the rebound 
from januarys 105 percent decline the steepest drop ever 
recorded 
the department said most of the boost was due to increased 
orders for transportation equipment saying that excluding 
transportation the advance was only 20 percent 
the increase in transportation equipment in march of 210 
percent to 362 billion was mostly attributable to aircraft and 
parts although motor vehicles and parts also had a significant 
increase it said 
the gain in transportation orders was the sharpest since a 221 
percent advance in december 1988 
the closely watched nondefense capital goods sector often a 
barometer of business investment plans jumped 149 percent to 
414 billion after diving 61 percent in february 
sharp drops in airplane and automobile orders were responsible 
for the record decline in january the department reported 
aircraft orders continued to slide in february but a resumption 
in autobuilding helped pushed total orders up the department 
counts car orders and production as the same 
the auto industry had laid off more than 90000 workers during 
january to ease bloated inventories most of those workers returned 
to production lines in february 
the january report had been viewed as another sign of weakness 
in the manufacturing sector of the economy that sector has been 
particularly affected by highinterest polices of the federal 
reserve since many of the bigticket items are financed by 
loans 
but the march report shows that most of that loss has been 
regained 
new orders for defense capital goods a highly volatile 
category fell 45 percent to 73 billion after gaining 184 
percent in february excluding defense orders rose 75 percent 
orders for primary metals were up 70 percent to 117 billion 
nonelectrical machinery orders rose 16 percent to 227 
billion while orders for electrical machinery gained 11 percent to 
201 billion 
shipments of durable goods were up 15 percent to 125 billion 
while unfilled orders rose 08 percent to 4967 billion

hundreds of thousands of armenians flocked to a 
hillside memorial in yerevan today to mark the killing of more than 
a million of their people 75 years ago under ottoman turkish rule 
residents said 
meanwhile in jerusalems old city 300 armenians marched to mark 
the anniversary about 15 million armenians were killed between 
1915 and 1923 citizens of the soviet republic say 
beginning at dawn today armenians marched toward the memorial 
in yerevan the republics capital waiting up to three hours to 
lay flowers near its eternal flame said raffi hovannisian of the 
armenian assembly of america 
black flags and redorangeandblue armenian national flags flew 
from many of the citys buildings he said from yerevan 
these people are looking into the past at the genocide seeing 
in some respect that its been repeated in sumgait and baku and 
elsewhere and yet still looking into the future hovannisian 
said theres a combination of grief and commitment 
scores of armenians died in ethnic attacks in the azerbaijani 
cities of sumgait two years ago and baku this winter sporadic 
fighting continues between armenians and azerbaijanis in the 
disputed territory of nagornokarabakh 
about 3 million armenians live in the soviet republic and 15 
million live abroad hovannisian said as many as 2 million were 
expected to participate in memorial processions and ceremonies 
in jerusalem marchers carried wreathes and candles as they 
walked from the walled armenian quarter to the communitys nearby 
cemetery armenian church patriarch torkum manoogian wearing a 
black hood and a crimson robe led the procession 
dozens of teenage marchers wore shirts emblazoned with the 
words april 24 1915 and many carried posters with slogans 
such as end turkish occupation of armenia and struggle is 
born with every armenian 
about 7000 armenians live in israel the occupied west bank and 
the communitys walled quarter in jerusalems old city 
the campaign to exterminate the armenians began late in the 19th 
century under ottoman sultan abd alhamid ii it was stepped up in 
1915 when the armenians were accused of helping russian invaders 
during world war i 
the turkish government has a different account of the armenian 
deaths turkish officials maintain that between 300000 and 600000 
armenians died most of famine or disease during forced deportation 
to syria and iraq 
the issue dormant for decades was resurrected in the 1970s 
when armenian extremists began more than a decade of attacks 
against turkish diplomats abroad saying they were avenging the 
massacre of their ancestors

clubwielding police broke up a 
demonstration today by several hundred anticommunist protesters 
who blocked a downtown square for the third straight day 
the demonstrators mostly young people erected barricades from 
wooden advertising panels and vowed to remain in university square 
until the government of interim president ion iliescu resigned 
some 400 steelhelmeted paramilitary police moved into the 
square at 5 am to disperse about 200 protesters and began 
beating them with clubs several demonstrators were injured 
witnesses said 
it marked one of the few times since last decembers bloody 
overthrow of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu that romanias 
interim leadership has used force against anticommunist 
demonstrators 
the demonstrators have occupied the square in varying numbers 
since sunday and blocked traffic in the city center the square was 
the scene of heavy fighting during the revolution that led to 
ceausescus execution 
the protesters contend that iliescu and other former members of 
the discredited communist party hold too much influence in the 
countrys interim government romania will hold parliamentary 
elections on may 20 the first free multiparty elections in more 
than 40 years 
after the police action protesters began to reassemble on the 
square and by midafternoon about 3500 people had gathered and 
began erecting the barricades again on the square outside the 
intercontinental hotel 
the demonstrators chanted various slogans including down with 
communism and down with assassins 
we came here to put communism down a 73yearold man who 
declined to be identified shouted at the major commanding the 
police who ringed the square at the end of a treelined boulevard 
meanwhile iliescu branded the protesters as thugs who were 
inciting people to violence and hatred he spoke at todays 
session of the provisional council for national unity the 
countrys makeshift parliament 
with such violent groups of thugs we cannot find the road to 
democracy and impose a new civilization said iliescu 60 a 
former communist party secretary who was demoted to lesser jobs 
after falling into disfavor with ceausescu 
iliescus remarks prompted shouts of shame shame shame 
from some members of the council who said he was resorting to the 
same kind of terminology used by ceausescu to describe opponents 
you made a terrible mistake mr iliescu said ion lup 
deputy secretary general of the peasant party 
nica leon president of the liberal democratic party and a 
member of the ruling council said the protesters want the 
former communists toppled from the leadership 
in his speech iliescu appealed to leaders of the more than 70 
political parties that have emerged since december to assume 
responsibility and respect public order 
iliescu is head of the national salvation front and its 
candidate for president in the may 20 elections the fronts 
leading members are former communists who now described themselves 
as reformers 
the front which claims some 800000 members is widely seen as 
the leading contender in the elections drawing support from 
industrial workers and former communist party members 
opposition parties accuse the front of advocating 
neocommunism or communism with a human face saying its 
leaders are following the policies of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev

president mobutu sese seko today 
announced plans to lift a 20yearold ban on opposition parties 
following weeks of pressure from all sectors of society and western 
supporters 
mobutu said his popular movement for the revolution since 1970 
the only official party no longer would hold special status 
initially three parties would be allowed mobutu said 
he also said the countrys constitution will be rewritten and a 
transition government set up to run the country until elections can 
be held the new government would be in place by april 24 1991 he 
said 
mobutu made the announcement in a speech to the nation which 
was carried by the official zairean news agency 
in recent weeks mobutu had been battered by a wave of 
unprecedented criticism the culmination of his own campaign to 
gauge popular opinion the countrys roman catholic bishops 
compared his rule to a monarchy 
in january mobutu began a tour of zaire which is as large as 
the united states east of the mississippi seeking public comment 
on his rule 
thousands of replies came from business groups churches 
unions students and individuals many bitterly criticized the 
government and mobutu accusing the president and his cronies of 
corruption and monopolizing power 
mobutu did not reply directly to the criticisms in his speech 
but promised the will of the majority will be respected we will 
proceed together on the changes wanted by the majority 
mobutu a 59yearold former journalist and army sergeant has 
ruled the former belgian congo since nov 24 1965 he renamed the 
country and made it almost into an image of himself 
although the popular movement became the only legal party in 
1970 in the years after he took power mobutu dissolved parliament 
and virtually eliminated opposition parties 
like most african presidents mobutu asserted oneparty rule was 
the only way to avoid tribal conflict in the countrys first five 
years of independence more than 100000 people died in fighting 
attributed to ethnic or regional conflicts 
all zaire citizens were made members of mobutus party were 
told to renounce their christian names for african ones and men 
were required to replace westernstyle ties with a highnecked 
jacket 
under a policy of authenicity mobutu himself changed his 
name from joseph desire mobutu to mobutu sese seko translated as 
the all powerful warrior who 
mobutu also nationalized key industries and replaced foreigners 
with zaireans at their helm production collapsed along with much 
of countrys infrastructure mobutu was accused of plundering 
zaires wealth his critics say he amassed several billion dollars 
twice he needed major western military intervention to put down 
rebellions international organizations and opposition leaders said 
he brutally repressed any opposition 
but the united states and other western governments supported 
mobutu who opposed the expansion of marxism in the region zaire 
has been a conduit of us aid to anticommunist guerrillas in 
angola zaires southern neighbor 
mobutus critics in the us congress however have said that 
under better eastwest relations the us no longer needs to 
cultivate mobutu

hundreds of policemen deserted their 
posts or stayed home today after antimonarchist mobs beat to death 
six of their colleagues in daylong rioting government sources said 
at least three police stations in the capital were seen to be 
empty almost none of the capitals 4000 policemen were walking 
the streets 
a few armed policemen entered deserted police stations late 
today but allowed no one to enter a 10hour curfew restricting 
people to their homes began at 7 pm and some policemen in jeeps 
and trucks patrolled the city 
mondays violence was the worst since april 6 when police 
opened fire on prodemocracy demonstrators and threatened the 
fledgling prodemocracy movement in this himalayan kingdom 
until this month king birendra had exercised virtually absolute 
power 
five civilians were killed by police gunfire in mondays unrest 
and according to the stateowned rashtriya samachar samiti news 
agency 15 policemen were missing only one policeman had been 
found by late today 
the mobs accused police of condoning and sometimes joining an 
underground promonarchist group blamed for a wave of crime since a 
new government headed by prodemocracy forces took office last week 
two policemen captured early monday were beaten for more than 
six hours before they died four more policemen were dragged from a 
police station and lynched by hundreds of people 
the crowds also set afire the zonal commissioners office which 
houses a police station today two policemen in riot gear stood 
guard outside the charred building 
they were the only policemen seen on foot during an hourlong 
tour of katmandu 
there are no policemen anywhere in the city said a taxi 
driver who said he had been driving the streets for six hours 
even traffic policemen are absent today 
one government source said the policemen were either 
unofficially withdrawn or are too scared to come out senior 
police officials could not be located for comment 
but shops opened and streets were clogged with traffic today 
after a tenhour curfew clamped on monday night was lifted at 6 
am there were no reports of violence 
the tremendous amount of confidence the people have in this 
government is compensating for the absence of police said home 
minister yog prasad upadhyay this is apparent from the fact that 
the country is peaceful 
prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai met with king birendra 
today to discuss the situation officials said no details of the 
meeting were available 
a scheduled meeting of the cabinet was postponed officials said 
on condition of anonymity there had been indications a shakeup in 
the top ranks of the police force might be forthcoming after the 
cabinet meeting 
bhattarai and his government a coalition of democrats 
communists royalists and independents took office last thursday 
after an eightweek campaign against the previous regime which was 
subservient to the king 
king birendra caved in to the campaign on april 8 two days 
after police shot and killed 200 demonstrators as they marched on 
the palace according to witnesses the government said 10 people 
were killed and 107 wounded in all of nepal on that day but two 
days later birendra lifted a 29year ban on political parties 
within 24 hours of the new government taking office the capital 
of 250000 people was faced with a rash of arson mugging and 
looting which residents blamed on a rightwing promonarchist 
group called mandale 
the mandale an abbreviated form of nepal vidyarthi mandal or 
nepal students group went underground in 1979 after birendra 
officially banned the group because of its violent tendencies

freed american hostage robert 
polhill spent most of his captivity in the same room as two fellow 
hostages and probably in the same building as other western 
captives us officials said today 
some details of polhills captivity emerged as a special team of 
us investigators began questioning him today about what he knows 
of other captives in lebanon and the shiite moslem militants who 
hold them 
the 55yearold business professor was reunited with his two 
sons today for the first time in more than three years they shared 
a lunch of spare ribs serenaded by a german accordionist the 
officials said 
polhill a new yorker has been staying in a vip suite at the 
us air force hospital in wiesbaden with his wife feryal his 
sons stephen 26 and brian 23 arrived this morning from the 
united states 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said polhill 
was held in the same room with american educators jesse turner 42 
of boise idaho and alann steen 51 a boston native all three 
were seized on jan 24 1987 from the american university in 
beirut campus where they had taught 
indianborn us resident mitheleshwar singh who was also 
kidnapped from the campus with the three professors shared the 
room until his release on oct 3 1988 the officials said 
theres a possibility he polhill was held in the same 
building with other hostages one us official said were 
fairly certain of that 
the official said he did not know which of the 17 westerners 
still in captivity might have also been held in the building seven 
americans are among those held 
we know from various sources where the hostages have been 
held the us official said explaining that they were moved 
regularly 
elsewhere there were indications a second hostage might soon be 
freed though us officials said they had no information on 
that 
and a london newspaper the independent reported that several 
dozen shiite prisoners held in southern lebanon by an 
israelibacked militia would be released in the next few days as 
part of a deal that won polhills release sources close to the 
militia said monday its leader would decide today whether to free 
some of the groups estimated 300 prisoners to mark the end of the 
islamic ramadan fast 
according to the latest information that we have received from 
lebanon maybe after a few days another hostage will be released 
irans foreign mnister ali akbar velayati told cnn in an 
interview monday 
he did not specify the nationality of the hostage who might be 
released 
hussein musawi a leading proiranian shiite moslem cleric in 
lebanon also said another of the 17 remaining western hostages 
might be freed soon musawi is thought to have influence over the 
group that held polhill 
the possibility of another release is in the cards but i 
dont know when how of for what he told the communistrun voice 
of the people radio in lebanon 
such a step polhills release has to have a reciprocation 
it is not feasible that all releases would be made as goodwill 
gestures musawi said 
tehran state radio in iran said polhills release might be a 
prelude to the release of other hostages but that washington and 
other western governments must show goodwill 
at the base hospital doctors said polhill appeared to be in 
good shape for a man who had been in captivity for more than three 
years but he was malnourished mildly dehydrated and quite tired 
polhills diabetes which he has had for 25 years is well 
under control the hospital said in a statement today 
the hospitals medical director col dr kenneth r koskinen 
said polhill suffered muscle wasting in captivity he added 
that polhill was eating four meals a day to combat his malnutrition 
and emptying our kitchen 
he added however he is intellectually very sharp has a 
great sense of humor and considering his ordeal has a reasonably 
positive mental status 
polhill an avid sports fan has asked a lot of questions about 
the world series and super bowl us officials said during his 
captivity he had only sporadic reading material 
asked whether polhill ever felt there was a moment he would be 
killed one us official said my understanding is that he never 
felt that 
polhill will spend several more days at wiesbaden before 
returning to the united states koskinen said 
polhill frail and weary carefully stepped out of a us air 
force helicopter at the american military hospital in wiesbaden on 
monday to a tumultous welcome from medical personnel soldiers and 
civilians 
a us official denied any deals were made for polhills release 
and said the united states had no information that a second hostage 
might soon be freed the official also said he was unaware of any 
payments from iran or syria to the kidnappers to win his release 
in a monday editorial the tehran times a paper close to 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran appealed for the release of 
another us hostage 
in lebanon a prosyrian militia leader said today he was 
working for the speedy release of two kidnapped swiss red cross 
workers 
mustafa saad leader of the leftist sunni moslem popular 
liberation army that controls the southern port of sidon told 
reporters were in contact with several parties concerned to 
ensure the speedy release of the swiss captives 
the two swiss emmanuel christen 33 and elio erriquez 24 
were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen oct 6 police and other 
security sources blamed palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
whose movement has denied the charge 
however the group admits holding four belgians seized in 
november 1987 aboard a yacht in the eastern mediterranean 
beiruts alliwa newspaper said today in an unattributed report 
the belgians would be released next week in a deal with their 
government to free convicted palestinian terrorist said nasser 
nasser believed to be a member of abu nidals faction is 
imprisoned in belgium for a 1980 grenade attack on a synagogue a

west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere today set july 2 as 
the target date for the economic monetary and social union of 
their countries 
while early july has frequently been mentioned as a goal this 
was the first bilateral announcement of a specific date 
the announcement read by west german government spokesman 
dieter vogel came as de maiziere met with kohl in his first visit 
to bonn as east germanys prime minister 
delegations from east and west germany will meet in east berlin 
on wednesday to begin negotiations on monetary union the bonn 
government announced earlier monetary union is a major step toward 
uniting the two german states 
the talks will cover bonns proposal monday to allow a 11 
exchange rate on wages salaries and pensions 
the 11 rate also would apply to savings accounts of up to 4000 
marks or about 2300 said kohl spokesman dieter vogel savings 
over that amount would be traded at two east german marks for every 
west german mark there had been reports west germany was 
considering the poorer rate for most savings 
the east german government had demanded the 11 rate to protect 
workers from higher living costs in a unified germany and the loss 
of huge subsidies that existed in the former socialist system 
east german politicians applauded the wage concession but 
criticized the limit on savings accounts 
west german opposition parties said the plan would cost 
billions erode the west german mark and lead to inflation west 
german stocks plunged to their lowest level of the year after the 
announcement 
west german finance minister theo waigel said his country will 
spend 35 billion to 58 billion over the next two years on 
unification 
many west germans who vote in national elections on dec 2 are 
worried they will bear the brunt of absorbing the crumbling east 
german economy 
the west german proposal is an important contribution to 
ending the disagreements between the nations east german 
government spokesman mathias gehler said 
but wolfgang ullmann vice president of east germanys 
parliament said if this is the final decision there should be 
sharp protest because a large part of savings will not be 
considered here 
meanwhile in east berlin monday east germany sent tons of its 
own money to the trashburner to make room in its treasury for the 
crisp new west german currency it hopes will bring prosperity 
soldiers stuffed sacks filled with old outofcirculation east 
german currency taking up space in the main treasury in east berlin 
the marks were carted off to the incinerator on monday so the 
government will have room for the new currency expected to begin 
officially circulating in the country by july 2 
the east german mark will not be needed with the introduction 
of the monetary union said the east german treasurys chief 
cashier horst boettcher 
in another step toward a single germany government sources in 
bonn said monday the four world war ii allies the soviet union 
united states france and britain will meet with the two germanys 
for talks may 5 on international aspects of german unification

the us territory of guam and its officials 
may not be sued for allegedly violating a muchused federal civil 
rights law the supreme court ruled today 
the justices by a 62 vote threw out part of a lawsuit filed 
by six guam residents who said police punched kicked and 
threatened them to get them to confess to drugrelated crimes 
writing for the court today justice harry a blackmun said 
congress was most concerned about the ku klux klans influence and 
race relations in southern states when it passed the 1871 law 
the law allows those who prove government actions or policies 
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages 
our review of the laws history uncovers no sign that 
congress was thinking of the territories when it enacted the 
statute blackmun said 
the six residents who sued guam and various officials are 
palauan natives of the island of palau they have their own 
culture language and physical characteristics 
their lawsuit alleged that racial bias sparked police brutality 
a federal appeals court dismissed the residents claims against 
the guam government the guam police department and the individual 
defendants in their official capacities 
todays decision upheld the appeals court ruling and 
effectively reduces the amount of money the palauans may recover if 
they eventually win their lawsuit 
the palauans had sought 100 million in damages 
the case is ngiraingas vs sanchez 881281

president bush will use his emergency 
authority to provide 26 million in medical aid to nicaragua as a 
show of support for new president violeta chamorro when she is 
inaugurated wednesday congressional and administration sources 
said today 
bushs request for 300 million in economic aid to nicaragua 
including money needed for spring planting of crops and for fuel 
is snarled by unrelated disputes on capitol hill and is unlikely to 
be approved in time for wednesdays swearingin ceremony 
the medical aid will provide a visible gesture that can be 
announced by vice president dan quayle when he attends the ceremony 
in managua mrs chamorro was elected overwhelming in february 
elections to replace president daniel ortega of the leftist 
sandinista party 
the medical assistance would be the first us aid to the 
central american country in nine years since president reagan cut 
off aid shortly after taking office in 1981 
mrs chamorro will take control of a country that is among the 
most impoverished in the hemisphere and has been battered by a 
decade of civil war and us trade sanctions 
officials of the new government say they face a difficult 
challenge in meeting the expectations of the electorate for peace 
and a better standard of living 
bush is seeking 300 million as a first installment of aid for 
the country along with 500 million for panama which also is 
suffering economic ills but the aid package a version of which 
has been passed by the house is being held up in the senate by a 
dispute over unrelated childcare legislation 
the medical aid is being provided under a littleused section of 
the foreign assistance law that permits the president to use up to

the interior department is proposing a new 
offshore oil leasing strategy it hopes will overcome congressional 
opposition to oil development and open the way for more drilling 
department officials said today 
the proposal was expected soon to be presented to president bush 
as part of a new fiveyear offshore oil leasing plan beginning in 
1992 
the revised proposal is aimed at breaking the political deadlock 
over expanded offshore drilling since president reagan opened the 
entire 14 billionacre outer continental shelf for potential 
development prompting outcries from environmentalists and many 
congressmen 
the new approach will be a lot more restrictive and lease 
sales will go a lot slower than in the past said barry 
williamson director of the departments minerals management 
service it will be a 180 degree change of what weve seen 
were taking a paring knife and were going to narrow and hold 
the process of offering leases down well do away to a large 
degree with the large areawide leasing concept williamson said 
in an interview 
the policies of the 1980s as they relate to offshore leasing 
are not working into the 1990s said interior spokesman steve 
goldstein he called the new approach much more realistic and 
said interior secretary manuel lujan hopes it will open the way for 
more offshore oil development 
the policy change was first reported in todays edition of the 
new york times 
williamson said that instead of considering vast expanses of 
offshore areas for oil development the department would draw 
boxes around areas that would be offlimits because of 
environmental concerns it would also single out areas where 
development should be pushed because of indications the prospects 
of finding oil would be good 
because the new concept would be more restrictive it may ease 
congressional opposition to the overall leasing effort interior 
officials said they said the areas that would be considered prime 
for development have yet to be determined nor how many acres would 
be considered for drilling 
only a small portion of the countrys outer continental shelf is 
used for oil and gas exploration mostly in the gulf of mexico 
congressional action has blocked development in vast areas along 
the atlantic and pacific coasts and off alaska 
bush is expected soon to announce his decision on whether to 
proceed with oil leases in three of the most controversial areas 
off the western coast of southern florida and off the california 
coast environmentalists and local citizen groups have strongly 
opposed drilling in the three areas 
officials said the new fiveyear plan would not be considered by 
the president until after his decision on the california and 
florida leases 
under interiors new approach the initial step of any leasing 
process would be to determine whether oil drilling or ship traffic 
would harm marine life and those areas would be withdrawn from 
consideration 
only areas where there is strong geological evidence of a 
potential oil strike would be put up for leases the plan also 
would share revenues from the leasing with coastal communities near 
the drilling sites in hopes of easing local opposition officials 
said 
the outer continental shelf a submerged ridge of land begins 
three miles offshore the petroleum industry has for years pushed 
for offshore development but efforts repeatedly have been blocked 
in most areas except in the gulf coast because of local opposition 
and freezes on lease sales imposed by congress

the kgb has reinforced its units on the lithuanian 
border and increased patrols offshore an official said today less 
than a week after the kremlin cut oil and gas to the baltic 
republic 
also today a fivemember delegation dispatched from lithuanias 
capital vilnius to meet with soviet representatives in moscow 
failed to win an audience one representative said 
a soviet government spokesman meanwhile warned that any us 
sanctions imposed on moscow because of its economic embargo of 
lithuania could end up hurting the breakaway republic 
moscow imposed the embargo on lithuania for refusing to rescind 
laws meant to bolster its march 11 declaration of independence the 
republic was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
kgb lt anatoly parakhin chief of the secret polices border 
guard indicated tighter security along the lithuanian frontiers 
was justified by fears weapons might be brought into the republic 
the tass news agency said 
since soviet president mikhail s gorbachev imposed the blockade 
on the republic lithuanian prime minister kazimeira prunskiene has 
been seeking supplies of petroleum from other countries 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev warned that 
any us sanctions imposed on the soviet union over lithuania could 
raise false hopes in lithuania and have negative consequences 
on the international scene 
such types of actions could play into the hands of 
unrealistic ultranationalistic feelings and they could hurt the 
interests of lithuania itself perfiliev said without elaborating 
perfiliev spoke before president bush announced today what were 
expected to be economic penalties against moscow 
on monday prunskiene said lithuania might have to sell some of 
its gold reserves to buy the fuel needed to reopen stalled 
industrial operations 
the soviet economic embargo forced the lithuanians to close 
their only oil refinery monday and try to raise cash to buy fuel 
from abroad 
the refinery at mazheikiai had been operating on reserves 
dispatcher lidiya cheblakova said from the refinery 
cheblakova said that with production stopped the refinerys 
2000 workers were now idle the mood is tense worrisome she 
said 
soviet officials shut off the oil pipeline feeding the plant 
from the russian city of polotsk last week and curtailed natural 
gas supplies and shipments of other products 
it was the toughest move taken in gorbachevs effort to make the 
republic of 38 million people rescind the laws seeking to promote 
lithuanias independence decree 
the refinery produced gasoline for the republic as well as for 
estonia latvia and byelorussia processing about 12 million tons 
of petroleum products a year of which lithuania used one quarter 
lithuania has virtually no foreign currency to buy oil but mrs 
prunskiene said monday that the republic might cash in gold 
reserves it has in france she told reporters in moscow however 
that the idea had not been approved yet according to interfax a 
news service of radio moscow 
lithuania needs about 55 million worth of oil a month 
the bank of france said last month that it would return the gold 
in its vaults to lithuania if the french government recognizes the 
independent state lithuania transferred gold now worth about 28 
million to france as a precaution in the years before world war ii 
mrs prunskiene told reporters in sweden on monday that she 
opened an account at a swedish bank to deposit foreign donations 
for lithuania 
in vilnius the lithuanian capital some bus routes were cut and 
the main thoroughfare gedimina street was practically devoid of 
vehicles as lithuanians struggled with gasoline rationing that 
limits them to about eight gallons a month for private cars 
the lithuanian government has urged all citizens to begin 
conserving everything 
a group of western journalists who had been allowed to visit 
vilnius returned to moscow on monday virtually all foreign 
correspondents were expelled from lithuania on april 1 but about 
20 to 25 moscowbased western journalists returned friday on a trip 
sponsored by the soviet foreign ministry lithuanias small 
communist party faction loyal to moscow apparently was behind the 
special trip hoping to win coverage of its party congress on 
saturday

the supreme court in a ruling that could 
affect millions of dollars in movie industry profits said today 
distributors of the alfred hitchcock thriller rear window must 
share with a literary agent earnings from the films rerelease 
the 63 ruling was a defeat for actor jimmy stewart and 
hitchcocks heirs some film producers claimed it could limit 
availability of movie classics 
stewart hitchcocks heirs and others sought to prevent literary 
agent sheldon abend from receiving a share of profits from rear 
windows rerelease in 1983 
abend paid chase manhattan bank 650 in 1971 for the copyright 
to the short story on which rear window was based 
he sued in federal court seeking a share of the more than 12 
million in revenue that the film has generated since 1983 when the 
1954 classic was released again in theaters and for the first time 
on rented video casettes and over cable television 
rear window is based on a short story it had to be 
murder by cornell woolrich that was first published in 1942 in 
dime detective magazine 
the motion picture starring stewart and grace kelly and 
directed by hitchcock had many elements not contained in the 
original short story 
woolrich sold the movie rights to his story in 1945 for 9250 
when he died in 1968 his property including the copyright to his 
story was left to a trust administered by chase manhattan 
abend said the rerelease of rear window infringed on his 
copyright and he also said the film distributors interfered with 
his plans to contract with home box office cable tv for a new play 
and tv version of the story 
the supreme court today upheld a federal appeals court ruling in 
abends favor the case now goes back to a lower court to determine 
how much money abend will receive 
the justices reached their decision by interpreting federal 
copyright law 
before 1976 a 1909 law permitted a copyright to be renewed for 
28 years after the initial 28year copyright period ended 
the law was amended in 1976 to provide for copyright protection 
for the life of the author plus 50 years but only to works 
copyrighted after jan 1 1978 
the high court said abend is entitled to copyright renewal 
protection even though woolrich died before the short story 
copyright was renewed 
the law is aimed at giving an author a second chance to make a 
profit on a creative work and to leave the money to ones heirs 
or executors in case the author dies before the copyright is 
renewed justice sandra day oconnor wrote for the court 
todays ruling does not let abend block distribution of rear 
window 
nonetheless some of the nations leading motion picture 
producing companies who supported the appeal by stewart and 
hitchcocks heirs said a victory for abend could mean that 
thousands of films based on books plays and short stories might 
have to be withdrawn from distribution more likely it means they 
could have to share profits from the films with copyright holders 
oconnor was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy dissenting were 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices john paul stevens 
and antonin scalia 
the case is stewart vs abend 882102

more than 32 years after an 11yearold boy 
was sodomized and hanged the victims cousin has been sentenced to 
life in prison for the murder 
were very relieved that its over mildred ruff the 
victims mother said after mondays sentencing of richard ruff 
may god have mercy on his soul 
ruff 53 was convicted on march 23 of firstdegree felony 
murder for the death of 11yearold william ruff jr 
william ruff was killed on aug 31 1957 and was found the next 
day hanging from a tree in a wooded area near his home in the 
albany suburb of colonie 
prosecutors said the conviction concludes the longest homicide 
investigation in new york state history 
ruff maintained his innocence during the sentencing i just 
never sodomized nobody i never killed anybody he said 
and thats the truth 
albany county court judge thomas keegan ordered the sentence to 
run consecutively with a 4 to 12year stretch ruff is serving for 
sexually abusing two young daughters of a woman he lived with in 
rensselaer county 
keegan turned down a motion by public defender joseph mccoy to 
dismiss the conviction on the grounds of insufficient evidence 
mccoy said his office would appeal 
were elated that the judge gave the maximum sentence chief 
assistant district attorney daniel s dwyer said outside the 
courtroom dwyer said he would write a letter urging that the state 
parole board keep ruff in state prison when he becomes eligible for 
parole in 22 years 
this mans shadow should never be cast in society he said 
ruff was not even considered a suspect in the killing until two 
years ago in 1988 christopher ruff a brother of the victim who 
is now an albany county sheriffs deputy noticed a police bulletin 
indicating his cousin was wanted in connection with a child 
sexabuse case in rensselaer county 
police found ruff in florida and questioned him for both the 
william ruff case and the rensselaer county sexual abuse case 
before he was brought back to albany 
dwyer based much of his case on statements ruff made to police 
in florida in which he confessed killing his cousin 
this defendant summarily executed this boy dwyer said

the supreme court ruling today in the case of 
an arkansas mass murderer allowed states to execute convicted 
murderers even if no appeals court reviews the validity of their 
convictions or death sentences 
by a 72 vote the justices threw out an appeal filed for but 
not by r gene simmons sentenced to death for killing 16 
relatives and acquaintances in 1987 
the court said such an appeal cannot be filed by a fellow death 
row inmate 
simmons says he wants to be executed and refuses to appeal his 
murder convictions or death sentence 
lawyers for arkansas death row inmate jonas h whitmore argued 
that state appeals courts must review all death sentences even 
when not asked to do so by the condemned murderer 
writing for the court today chief justice william h rehnquist 
said whitmore lacks the proper legal standing to mount a challenge 
in simmons behalf 
the court rejected arguments by whitmores lawyers that the 
uniqueness of the death penalty and societys interest in its 
proper imposition justifies some kind of relaxed legalstanding 
standard 
the short answer to this suggestion is that the requirement of 
a case or controversy is not merely a traditional rule or 
practice but rather is imposed directly by the constitution 
rehnquist said 
it is not for this court to employ untethered notions of what 
might be good public policy to expand our jurisdiction in an 
appealing case he said 
justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan who oppose 
capital punishment under all circumstances dissented 
writing for the two marshall said the court today allows a 
state to execute a man even though no appellate court has reviewed 
the validity of his conviction or sentence 
the court does not address the constitutional claim presented 
by whitmore whether a state must provide appellate review in a 
capital case despite the defendants desire to waive such review 
marshall said rather it decides whitmore does not have the 
standing to raise that issue before this court 
in other action today the court 
said in a ruling that could affect millions of dollars in 
movie industry profits that distributors of the alfred hitchcock 
thriller rear window must share with a literary agent earnings 
from the films rerelease 
the 63 ruling was a defeat for actor jimmy stewart and 
hitchcocks heirs some film producers claimed it could limit 
availability of movie classics 
ruled that the us territory of guam and its officials may 
not be sued for allegedly violating a muchused federal civil 
rights law 
the justices by a 62 vote threw out part of a lawsuit filed 
by six guam residents who said police punched kicked and 
threatened them to get them to confess to drugrelated crime 
the law allows those who prove government actions or policies 
violated their constitutional rights to collect monetary damages 
in what prosecutors called a murderous rampage in the little 
town of russellville simmons gunned down his wife three sons 
four daughters a soninlaw a daughterinlaw four grandchildren 
and two acquaintances within a few days of christmas 1987 
simmons 49 refused to appeal his convictions and death 
sentence saying he wanted to die by lethal injection as quickly as 
possible 
three days before simmons was to die march 16 1989 whitmore 
sought to challenge the states death penalty law in simmons 
behalf 
on the eve of the execution the nations highest court 
postponed simmons death to study whitmores argument that the 
constitution requires state appeals courts to review all death 
sentences even when the convicted defendant asks to die 
by ruling that whitmore lacked the legal standing to appeal in 
simmons behalf the court cleared the way for arkansas authorities 
to execute simmons without the validity of his conviction or 
sentence ever being reviewed by an appeals court 
after rejecting whitmores standing to press the appeal in his 
individual capacity the court rejected his attempt to press it as 
a next friend of simmons 
the legal concept of next friend is employed by the courts 
when prison inmates are incapable usually because of mental 
incompetence to appeal in their own behalf 
we hold that whitmore having failed to establish that simmons 
is unable to proceed on his own behalf does not have standing to 
proceed as next friend of ronald gene simmons rehnquist said 
the deathappeal case is whitmore vs arkansas 887146

saudi financier adnan khashoggi may have paid 
too much when he bought 38 paintings from imelda marcos for 65 
million an art expert testified 
ian glenn kennedy a senior vice president at christies auction 
house testified monday at the fraud trial of mrs marcos and 
khashoggi that 26 of the paintings had a combined value in 1986 of 
17 million to 27 million 
khashoggi has said he paid mrs marcos 65 million for the 
paintings as a favor because she and her late husband former 
philippine president ferdinand marcos needed money twentysix of 
the paintings were seized in 1987 in france at the urging of the 
united states 
the financier said he did not have the paintings appraised and 
acknowledges paying more than they were worth he said in an

peter w williams explained the process through which the marcoses 
acquired the crown building on fifth avenue in 1981 for 51 million 
williams said the deal was conducted through a series of banks 
and corporations in the united states switzerland the netherlands 
antilles panama and the philippines

four manhattan buildings with money embezzled from the philippine 
treasury

fourteen prominent ethnic 
albanians including the former communist party leader of troubled 
kosovo province were acquitted today on charges of inciting 
antigovernment protests 
it was considered the biggest political trial in this balkan 
nation in four decades the trial had been widely criticized by 
yugoslav and western human rights groups 
chief judge ismet emra acquitted azem vlasi kosovos former 
communist party chief and the 13 other defendants he cited a lack 
of evidence 
public prosecutor spasoje zamfirovic indicated he would demand a 
retrial the official tanjug news agency reported 
thousands of ethnic albanians chanting azem azem 
celebrated the acquittals as riot police stood by 
police also patrolled other major towns in the province to 
prevent ethnic clashes between albanians and serbs no major 
incidents were reported although some vlasi supporters reportedly 
threw stones at police 
serbs who represent a minority in kosovo received the verdict 
with disappointment belgrade radio reported 
ethnic albanians have been seeking more autonomy for kosovo 
which is part of the yugoslav republic of serbia 
vlasis acquittal was seen as a defeat for serbias hardline 
communist president slobodan milosevic a key advocate of holding 
the trial 
the government had originally accused vlasi and the other 
defendants of counterrevolutionary activities for instigating 
a wave of protests by ethnic albanians last winter 
the indictment charged that the protests eventually led to an 
armed insurrection that resulted in many deaths 
last week the charges against the 14 defendants were modified 
to remove the threat of the death penalty 
vlasi who was arrested in march 1989 was released after the 
sentence was announced 
this is a victory for justice in yugoslavia a tearful vlasi

here are brief sketches of the five 
discovery crew members 
air force col loren j shriver is making his second trip into 
space as commander of discovery on its mission to deploy the 15 
billion hubble space telescope 
shriver heads a crew of space veterans on the flight the last 
time the national aeronautics and space administration flew a crew 
of shuttle veterans was on the first postchallenger flight in the 
fall of 1988 
as commander shriver is responsible for guiding the shuttle 
back to the telescope should a problem occur after it is put in 
orbit other crew members then would spacewalk to fix the telescope 
the 45yearold astronaut first flew into space as pilot of 
nasas first secret shuttle mission for the pentagon that january 
1985 flight lasted three days 
the excitement surrounding the longawaited mission continued to 
mount as the launch day neared shriver said in a recent interview 
at the johnson space center 
this is a major milestone he said 
i think theyre scientists using hubble going to make some 
discoveries and answer some questions weve got now and probably 
raise a lot more than we know about right now 
shriver was born in jefferson iowa and grew up in paton iowa 
where his parents still live he graduated from paton consolidated 
high school 
he graduated from the air force academy with a bachelors degree 
in aeronautical engineering he earned a masters degree in 
astronautical engineering from purdue university 
he attended the air force test pilot school at edwards air force 
base calif and worked on development test and evaluation of the 
f15 fighter aircraft in 1978 he was selected for astronaut 
training 
he and his wife susan have four children

marine col charles f bolden jr pilot of discovery says he 
is awed at the prospect of helping deploy a telescope so important 
to scientists and the study of the universe 
theres a lot of sentimental attachment to this thing for 
me bolden a veteran of one previous shuttle mission said in a 
recent interview 
bolden noted that although the five discovery astronauts 
actually will put the hubble space telescope in orbit thousands of 
people have worked on the project 
i cant even begin to imagine how good were going to feel 
when its deployed 
bolden a vietnam combat veteran insists he has no unique 
skills over other nasa pilots that earned him a seat on the 
celebrated flight 
im just lucky and thankful to be here bolden said 
from my standpoint theres nothing special that i bring other 
than my own unique personality and the ability not to be quite as 
serious as you could possibly get on a flight of this magnitude 
bolden 43 was born in columbia sc where he graduated from 
ca johnson high school 
he received a bachelors degree in electrical science from the 
us naval academy and a masters in systems management from the 
university of southern california he also is a graduate of the 
navys test pilot school at patuxent river md 
while in southeast asia bolden flew more than 100 missions as 
an a6 attack plane pilot 
bolden was selected for astronaut training in 1980 he was a 
pilot on his first trip into space a january 1986 mission that 
was the last shuttle to fly before challenger exploded shortly 
after liftoff 
he and his wife alexis have two children

mission specialist steven a hawley will use discoverys 50foot 
robot arm to hoist the hubble space telescope out of the cargo bay 
and place it in space 
as an astrophysicist hawley has a special interest in the 
telescope he even went to graduate school with some of the 
scientists who will use hubble once it is in orbit 
its unquestionably a major step the 38yearold astronaut 
said 
its not unfair i think to speculate that the kind of things 
the hubble telescope may see will be revolutionary in terms of what 
we know about the universe 
we know a lot now we think he said there are some very 
important questions however that just have been beyond our grasp 
because scientists have not been able to see distant areas 
clearly 
hawley one of three mission specialists on discovery also is 
the flight engineer the crew member who sits on the flight deck 
during ascent and landing to assist the commander and pilot 
hawley first flew on a sevenday mission in 1984 in which three 
satellites were deployed his current crew member charles bolden 
also was on board hawleys second mission a january 1986 flight 
that was the last to fly before the challenger explosion 
he was born in ottawa kan and grew up in salina kan where 
he graduated from salina high school 
hawley received a bachelors degree in physics and astronomy 
from the university of kansas and a doctorate in astronomy and 
astrophysics from the university of california 
before he was selected for astronaut training in 1978 hawley 
was a postdoctoral research associate in chile 
he is married to the former eileen keegan

the social security administration has 
rejected a proposal that it collect income taxes on many social 
security benefits paid to children claimed as dependents by their 
parents 
the agency rejected the proposal made by the inspector general 
of the health and human services department as antifamily and 
contrary to president bushs goal of a kindler gentler america 
inspector general richard kusserow recommended in an audit 
released tuesday that the taxes be paid by most of the 334000 
middle and upperincome families whose children how receive 
taxfree benefits 
even as the children were receiving the taxfree benefits about 
45 million retirees and disabled beneficiaries and their spouses 
at the same income levels were paying income taxes on as much as 
onehalf of their social security benefits 
kusserows report was based on a study of benefits and taxes in 
1986 he called the present social security policy inequitable 
and said it will cost the government more than 1 billion in lost 
revenues over the next five years 
children pay no income tax on their social security benefits 
unless their income exceeds 25000 a year 
in a memo included in the report social security commissioner 
gwendolyn king rejected the proposal saying she was concerned 
about how it would be perceived by congress and the public 
congress did not intend for childrens benefits to be taxable 
income to anyone other than the children who receive them she said 
also she said taxing the benefits of children claimed as 
dependents by parents could be considered antifamily and taxing 
disabled childrens benefits could appear harsh and contrary to a 
kinder gentler america

jubilant astronomers saw decades of 
work take wing tuesday as the hubble space telescope was boosted 
high above earth to launch a great adventure for mankind 
charles robert odell a rice university space physicist who has 
worked 19 years on hubble said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard 
the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a 
child ive been with the program since it was a concept 
there is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and 
five of my friends thrust into orbit he said 
colin norman a physics and astronomy professor at johns hopkins 
university and academic affairs director of the space telescope 
science institute there called the launch the perfect start to a 
great adventure for mankind 
it was incredibly beautiful the power of the launch was 
awesome and the telescope has an awesome power norman said 
discoverys liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended 
seven years of delays the 15 billion telescope originally was 
scheduled for launch in 1983 but remained grounded by technical 
problems and the challenger explosion 
two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the 
kennedy space center the launch was scrubbed four minutes before 
liftoff only a few dozen of them returned tuesday but they were 
just as excited 
there were times when we were deeply depressed there were 
times when we were elated about hubbles progress said william 
h jeffreys a university of texas astronomer and hubbles 
astrometry project leader jeffreys said this is one of those 
times when we are thrilled beyond belief 
ed weiler nasa program scientist for hubble said watching the 
liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle 
launch and the launch of the hst it really gets to you

crews today controlled a fire that 
burned two train tank cars of crude oil at the site of a derailment 
and turned their attention to the threat of an oil and chemical 
spill to drinking water 
everything looks super said don grafton chief of the 
worthington volunteer fire department it looks like we have it 
licked 
except for intermittent flames firefighters had brought the 
blaze under control with foam fire retardant grafton said 
the two cars exploded into flames late monday night and 15 
officials and firefighters monitoring the derailment narrowly 
escaped injury authorities said 
the explosion came a full day after 29 cars of a 97car buffalo 
amp pittsburgh railroad freight train plunged into a ravine along 
buffalo creek 
the popular fishing creek in this rural community about 45 miles 
northeast of pittsburgh is a tributary of the allegheny river the 
source of drinking water for several pittsburgharea communities 
about 100000 gallons of oil leaked from four railcars and up to 
10000 gallons of sodium hydroxide a caustic chemical used to 
clean drains leaked from one car said john bell the railroads 
general manager he said some of the oil and a small amount of the 
chemical spilled into the creek 
booms were set up to skim globs of oil from the water surface 
twelve of the derailed cars carried crude oil said don grafton 
chief of the worthington volunteer fire department 
in addition to the two brought under control today he said the 
oil burned off from five cars and one containing more than 26000 
gallons of crude oil had been close enough to be in danger of 
exploding grafton said 
work crews planned to wait until the hot cars cooled before 
beginning the tedious task of cleaning up the site grafton said 
firefighters will pump out crude oil left in tanker cars to prevent 
more fires and explosions he said 
an advisory recommending that elderly residents young children 
and people with respiratory problems stay indoors was lifted 
shortly before noon said betsy mallison spokeswoman for the state 
department of environmental resources the advisory was issued 
monday because of sulfur dioxide emissions from burning coal 
about 50 people evacuated from their homes may be allowed to 
return today if the situation remains stable grafton said 
firefighters had hoped to avoid an explosion by cooling the tank 
cars with water but they stopped spraying at the request of state 
department of environmental resources officials who feared that a 
dike built to contain the runoff would overflow 
firefighters and officials retreated just before the tankers 
burst into flames allegheny county fire marshal john kaus said 
we just started to come off the hillside and we heard a loud 
hissing and then a rumble kaus said the tankers exploded 
moments apart he said 
the only thing we saw in front of us in back of us on top 
of us was fire i never want to go through it again the only 
thing i could attribute it to was like walking through hell kaus 
said if it had happened five to 10 minutes earlier we would 
have lost 15 to 20 men 
two carloads of smoldering coal were moved to a field about 150 
yards from the track bell said the coal was spread on the ground 
and sprayed with water to cool it 
about 200 people had been evacuated late sunday but most were 
allowed to return home monday

there were more than 15 million refugees last 
year despite the easing of international tension the us 
committee for refugees said tuesday 
the number of refugees worldwide has increased by 50 percent 
in the last five years from 10 million in 1985 to 15 million in 
1989 robert p winter director of the private group said in a 
statement 
that does not take into account at least that many more 
persons who have fled their homes for the same reasons as refugees 
but who remain within the boundaries of their countries 
the committee had estimated the total number of refugees at 144 
million the previous year 
the opening of the border between east germany and west germany 
brought a large westward flow at the end of 1989 however the 
committee said its numbers didnt include 720000 ethnic germans 
who went to west germany from eastern europe three times as many 
as the year before 
the committee says its annual report contains the most 
comprehensive statistics available 
precise figures cannot be obtained in many remote areas 
however the number of refugees in sudan are estimated at from 2 
million to 32 million 
most of the 1989 increase came in africa 
malawi one of the worlds poorest countries shelters 812000 
refugees from mozambique which is even poorer the refugees have 
fled civil war in mozambique and their numbers were increasing as 
1989 ended 
another 80000 fled civil war in sudan and 40000 left angola 
for namibia hundreds of thousands have been displaced within burma 
during 40 years of civil war the committee said 
more than a million refugees come from each of four areas 
afghanistan mozambique ethiopia and israel 
despite the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan the biggest 
single source of refugees the report said 59 million afghans 
remained outside their homeland most are in pakistan and iran 
between 1975 and 1988 the united states accepted the largest 
number of refugees 1249608 or one for every 199 americans 
canada was second with 252225 but the proportion was larger 
one for every 104 canadians sweden australia and denmark also 
took proportionally larger numbers than the united states

orders for bigticket durable goods in march 
posted their best showing in more than a year but analysts gave 
the government report a subdued review 
its pretty much in line with what we have been seeing all 
quarter said michael k evans of evans economics inc in 
washington 
the economy is picking up clearly theres no sign of a 
recession on the other hand its not a boom either 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last more than three years jumped 67 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 1288 billion it was the largest increase 
since a 74 percent gain in december 1988 
however analysts noted that most of the growth was consigned to 
the aircraft industry excluding the transportation category 
orders rose 2 percent 
its not nearly as good as the 67 percent would suggest 
because most of it was just a turnaround in aircraft orders 
evans said 
aircraft orders had declined for two consecutive months 
im not going to denegrate this number said robert g 
dederick chief economist at the northern trust co in chicago 
but at the same time youre talking about a durable goods 
sector thats still in the same sort of sideways drift that its 
been in for a number of months 
economist thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd 
pa noted that orders rose in all categories a sign that 
economic growth will be more positive for the remainder of 1990 
this definitely supports that we are coming out of the 
economic slowdown runiewicz said 
another bright spot in the march report was a 149 percent jump 
to 414 billion in the closely watched nondefense capital goods 
orders that sector often is a leading indicator of future business 
investment plans 
the march report was the second monthly rebound from januarys 
record 105 percent decline brought about by sharp drops in 
aircraft and automobile orders 
aircraft orders continued to fall in february but a resumption 
in automobile orders helped push overall orders up 23 percent 
however that was weaker than the 33 percent gain originally 
reported last month 
but transportation orders advanced 21 percent in march mostly 
because of aircraft orders although demand for automobiles also 
rose significantly the commerce department said it was the 
largest transportation gain since a 221 percent increase in 
december 1988 
smaller increases were posted elsewhere primary metals up 7 
percent to 117 billion nonelectrical machinery up 16 percent 
to 227 billion and electrical machinery up 11 percent to 201 
billion 
the oftenvolatile defense orders fell 45 percent to 73 
billion after rising 184 percent in february 
excluding defense however orders rose 75 percent the largest 
increase since an 83 percent jump in september 1980 
shipments of durable goods were up 15 percent to 125 billion 
while unfilled orders rose 08 percent to 4967 billion

a man in a business suit opened fire today in the 
food court of a suburban shopping mall killing one man and 
wounding at least three other people authorities said 
james calvin brady 32 of atlanta was charged with one count of 
murder and three counts of aggravated assault dekalb county public 
safety director thomas brown said 
as officers led brady away he muttered you dont know what 
all these people have done to me brown said 
he said police had not established a motive for the attack 
we dont believe it was directed toward the individuals who 
were shot we think it was directed toward people in general 
brown said 
todd smith assistant manager of a deli at perimeter mall said 
he looked up when he thought he heard a balloon pop about 1130 
am and saw a man in a suit firing off about four rounds 
it appears to be random he said adding that the diners in 
the area panicked everybody just dispersed he threw the gun 
in the trash can and then he walked off 
one man wounded in the chest was taken to northside hospital 
where he died about 1 hours after the shooting hospital 
spokeswoman carol king said his identity was not released 
three more victims two women and a man were taken to 
shallowford hospital hospital spokeswoman cathy mcafee said the 
man in his 20s suffered a leg wound that was not lifethreatening 
and was listed in stable but critical condition 
the two women were in stable condition one in her 50s had a 
pelvic wound and the other in her 70s suffered an abdominal 
wound she said 
there was some confusion over the number of people shot police 
at first said four then five but hospital officials said only 
four people were taken to the two hospitals 
the food court was not crowded said willie edwards a delivery 
driver for a mens store in the mall this was like prelunch 
hour it really hadnt got as crowded as it could have been he 
said 
mary jo cullinan manager of brentanos bookstore said she and 
four customers heard the gunfire 
i suddenly heard six shots fired she said we ran into 
the back of the store we came out when we couldnt hear anything 
two of the customers asked to leave out the back door because they 
didnt want to go back out into the mall understandably

democrats have decided against nominating 
anyone to oppose republican sen john w warner the decision 
blocks a democratic bid by a lyndon h larouche jr supporter the 
state democratic chairman said tuesday 
the party chairman paul goldman said he had reports on about 
1500 of the 1800 delegates elected at mass meetings around the 
state saturday and monday 
about 90 percent of the people have been elected for no 
candidate goldman said slightly less than 10 percent were 
uncommitted and four delegates supported former us rep joseph 
fisher who has not decided whether to run 
nancy spannaus a follower of larouche received no support for 
her bid for the democratic nomination goldman said 
this is an unprecedented repudiation of political extremism 
he said im really proud of the democratic party all across the 
state 
to block mrs spannaus candidacy the democratic state central 
committee agreed that the party convention would be canceled if 
more than 50 percent of the democrats attending the mass meetings 
did not want a candidate 
the committee still could select a nominee by a twothirds vote 
before the june 12 filing deadline 
i dont know what will happen goldman said maybe a 
candidate will come forward maybe one wont 
he declined to say whether the committee would support fisher 
im not going to prejudge anything goldman said 
mrs spannaus has said she may run as an independent 
she has described herself as a democrat but goldman said he did 
not think she would confuse voters 
with warner 63 wellfinanced and heavily favored for 
reelection to a third term gov l douglas wilder said in january 
he would rather his fellow democrats nominate no one than a weak 
candidate 
bu goldman said democrats would continue to criticize warners 
record in washington 
we still have a case to be made against warner he said 
were just looking for somebody to make the case

a lawyer who won acquittal for a defendant in 
the 1976 assassination of former chilean ambassador orlando 
letelier said tuesday he wants to represent another man charged in 
the killing 
new york attorney paul goldberger appeared in us district 
court with jose dionisio suarez esquivel a cuban exile arrested 
april 11 in the car bombing that killed letelier 
suarez had been a fugitive since his 1978 indictment ed sussman 
was appointed by the court to represent suarez who was arrested in 
st peterburg fla 
suarezs family and friends will decide whether to retain 
goldberger who earlier represented guillermo novo sampol novo 
indicted for conspiracy killing a foreign official and five other 
charges was acquitted in the letelier case eight years ago 
assistant us attorney eric marcy said goldbergers entry into 
the case would present a serious conflict of interest because novo 
is a potential government witness against suarez 
goldberger said he doubted prosecutors would call novo who he 
said did not intend to cooperate with the government raising the 
conflict issue might be a way to get us out of the case 
goldberger said in a brief interview outside the courtroom 
us district court judge aubrey robinson said he would address 
the question of conflict of interest if goldberger is hired 
suarez is accused of murdering a foreign official and four other 
charges in the death of letelier chiles ambassador to washington 
from 1970 to 1973 under the marxist government of salvador allende 
also indicted were the two top officials in chiles intelligence 
service during the military rule of gen augusto pinochet the 
chilean courts have refused to extradite the two former officials

president bush said today he will not impose 
sanctions on the soviet union in response to the kremlins 
crackdown in lithuania saying such steps at this time could 
backfire 
im concerned that we not inadvertently do something that 
compels the soviet union to take action that would set back the 
whole case of freedom around the world bush said after a meeting 
with congressional leaders 
bush told a group of agricultural writers that while he was not 
ready to announce penalties at this time against the soviet union 
if there were anything done it would be on the economic 
side 
bush also said he would not consider imposing a grain embargo on 
the soviet union in response to its actions in lithuania 
administration officials said bush who appeared a day ago to be 
on the brink of imposing economic penalties decided to wait after 
reports from moscow that us sanctions could wind up making the 
situation worse in lithuania 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush 
decided to hold off on any sanctions at this time after 
consultations with leaders of at least 20 countries 
there was a confluence of voices particularly from allies 
in western europe against strong us steps against moscow 
fitzwater said 
he cited concerns of soviet countermoves not only against 
lithuania and other baltic states but in poland and other fragile 
new eastern european democracies 
still fitzwater said bush still retains the right to impose 
economic sanctions to protest soviet tactics in lithuania and 
might do so at any time 
im not going to give up trying to get the soviet union and 
the lithuanians into a dialogue bush said 
i would encourage the soviet union and the lithuanians to go 
forward right now with dialogue he said lets hope they can 
start talking this results in a great deal of potential for the 
freedom that we seek for the lithuanians 
therein lies the answer bush said 
i will let the american people know and the congress know 
when i decide to take certain action and the decision has not been 
made he added 
administration officials had said earlier that bush was near a 
decision on a package of economic penalties but participants at 
todays congressional meeting said the president voiced repeated 
concerns over soviet retaliation against lithuania should the 
united states step up its pressure on moscow 
sen claiborne pell dri said bush told congressional leaders 
he was not prepared to announce sanctions at this time because 
the action could precipitate an escalation we dont want to see 
that happen 
pell speaking to reporters on the white house driveway after 
the hourlong session said that there emerged from the session a 
general feeling of support for the president 
rep dante fascell dfla chairman of the house foreign 
affairs committee suggested one factor in bushs hesitancy to act 
could be because that us allies in western europe are not 
willing to consider stiff economic sanctions 
fascell said he told bush that a better response would be to 
postpone the may 30june 3 superpower summit that would send a 
message all around the world fascell said he said the president 
did not respond to the suggestion 
house speaker thomas foley dwash gave bush a vote of 
confidence following the white house meeting 
i think the president is proceeding carefully and think that 
is the appropriate course foley told reporters i am not at 
all critical of the president i think hes approaching it 
appropriately 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said that bush indicated he wanted 
to consult with members of congress on the situation and added 
i dont think any decisions were arrived at 
bentsen called the crisis in lithuania a situation where a 
great deal of discretion would be given to the president 
a report from moscow quoting soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
vadim p perfiliev suggesting that us sanctions could wind up 
backfiring and hurting lithuania may have been a factor in bushs 
decision an administration official said 
the measures under consideration included delaying or 
withholding a variety of planned trade investment and other 
economic concessions that the united states had been prepared to 
grant the soviet union said officials who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
the would in effect put a hold on ussoviet trade 
liberalization talks which were scheduled to get under way today 
in paris 
the kremlin says sanctions could hurt both lithuania and the 
overall international situation 
perfiliev said that moscows dispute with lithuania was a 
problem which is purely an internal affair and any actions which 
could pull the sides in the argument even further apart could have 
negative consequences not only for the soviet union but for the 
international situation

seven years late the hubble space 
telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of 
others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning 
of time 
less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle 
discovery on tuesday the 15 billion telescope sent its first 
test radio signal at the sign of life applause and cheers erupted 
in mission control in houston 
as near as we can tell everything looks perfect said 
astronaut steve hawley from the shuttle hawleys job on wednesday 
will be to drop the telescope overboard for a 15year stay in space 
discovery trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue 
sky carried the silvercolored telescope to an orbit 380 miles 
above earth higher by 70 miles than any previous shuttle there 
the hubble will stay to search for yetunseen wonders of creation 
with instruments that can look 14 billion years backward in time 
our window on the universe nasa launch commentator george 
diller exulted as the discovery rose off its seaside launch pad 
its a beautiful day to have hubble space telescope in orbit 
instead of here on earth like its been for so many years said 
nasa administrator richard truly hubbles in its element and im 
delighted 
the telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983 but technical 
problems and the challenger accident delayed its deployment it 
suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was 
stopped at the fourminutestogo point because of a faulty 
hydraulic unit on the shuttle 
while it remained on earth the telescope cost 7 million a 
month to exercise and keep in readiness in its first day in space 
that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the 
goddard space flight center in maryland 
on hand to watch the discovery launching was a contingent of 
scientists who have hailed the hubble as the greatest advance in 
astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 
400 years ago 
truly referred to the earlyday astronomer when he was asked 
about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working 
station 
somebody the other day said who remembers the day that 
galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars said 
truly a former shuttle astronaut it doesnt matter what day we 
launch hubble it matters that we do it right 
the telescope is 43 feet long and 14 feet in diameter about the 
size of a railroad tank car when it flies free it will receive 
electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two 
winglike solar arrays that extend outward on each side 
it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who 
theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away 
a galaxy is the faster it is traveling that gave support to the 
theory that a massive explosion the big bang created the 
universe 10 to 20 billion years ago 
the hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major 
questions how old is the universe how big is it 
the telescope has two mirrors one 945 inches in diameter the 
other 12 inches two of the instruments are cameras two are 
spectrometers and one is a photometer in addition the fine 
pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise 
measurement of distances 
on wednesday hawley is to grapple the 12ton telescope with 
the shuttles mechanical arm lift it out of the cargo bay point 
it and after a long checkout drop it overboard to orbit on its 
own 
in the cargo bay the telescope receives electrical power from 
the shuttle but the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out 
and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are 
extended to receive light from the sun 
should the solar panels not deploy mission specialists bruce 
mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be standing by partially 
dressed in space suits ready to go into the open cargo bay to 
unfurl the arrays manually 
discoverys launch was not without its problems 
with 31 seconds left in the countdown the computer that runs 
the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and 
stopped the launch process the problem was overcome and the 
shuttle lifted off at 834 am edt about three minutes late 
the shuttle is scheduled to land sunday at 949 am edt at 
edwards air force base in california 
on the way uphill as commander loren j shriver put it the 
shuttles windshield was splattered with several flecks of 
things he said the windshield was streaked by the debris and 
that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off 
during the climb to orbit 
the astronauts also had problems with their uhf radio circuit 
and one of the ships small rear thrusters was inoperative neither 
problem was considered serious

bowing to weeks of pressure president 
mobutu sese seko said tuesday he had lifted a 20year ban on 
opposition parties and would let a multiparty government replace 
his in a year 
thousands of zaireans chanting singing and waving branches 
poured into downtown kinshasa the capital and blocked the streets 
to cheer the presidents decision 
mobutu absolute ruler since taking power nov 24 1965 
announced in a nationally broadcast speech that he was setting up a 
transitional government to rule until free elections could be held 
no election date was set 
i am taking leave of the popular movement for the revolution 
mpr said mobutu 59 he said he would no longer be head of the 
party that supplanted the government in 1970 but would remain as 
president at the request of the people of zaire 
mobutu said three parties will be allowed at first his popular 
movement for the revolution which under zaires law was the 
countrys government no longer will hold any special status he 
said 
mobutu said one leading opposition figure etienne tshisekedi 
was released from detention tuesday and his union for democracy and 
social progess party legalized he did not say which of several 
other opposition groups whose leaders are in exile would be 
selected as the third legal party 
he said the constitution will be rewritten and a transitional 
government established until elections are held the elections will 
produce a new government by april 24 1991 he said 
in recent weeks mobutu had been battered by a wave of 
unprecedented criticism 
he began a tour of the nation in january seeking public comment 
on his rule thousands of replies were sent in from business 
groups churches unions students and individuals many bitterly 
critized the government and mobutu himself accusing the president 
and his cronies of corruption and monopolizing power 
the countrys roman catholic bishops compared mobutus rule to a 
monarchy 
mobutu did not reply directly to the criticisms but promised 
the will of the majority will be respected we will proceed 
together on the changes wanted by the majority 
the former journalist and army sergeant has ruled the former 
belgian congo since nov 24 1965 he renamed the country and ran 
it almost as a personal fiefdom 
like most african presidents mobutu has asserted oneparty rule 
was the only way to avoid tribalism in the countrys first five 
years of independence more than 100000 people died in fighting 
attributed to ethnic or regional conflicts 
since 1970 every citizen of zaire has been automatically 
registered as a member of the official party opposition groups 
were brutally repressed and mobutu claimed 9999 percent of the 
vote in presidential elections 
he renamed the country zaire and ordered zaireans to replace 
their christian names with african names men were required to 
replace westernstyle suits and neckties with highnecked jackets 
as part of mobutus campaign to replace european influences he 
ordered that people address each other as citizen rather than 
sir or madame 
mobutu himself changed his name from joseph desire mobutu to 
mobutu sese seko translated as the all powerful warrior who 
 
perhaps most symbolic about mobutus announcement tuesday was 
his declaration that westernstyle suits would no longer be banned 
and people could again call each other sir or madame 
after taking power mobutu nationalized key industries 
including copper production and replaced expatriate advisers and 
experts with zaireans 
production collapsed along with much of countrys 
infrastructure mobutu was accused of using his plan to plunder the 
countrys wealth his critics say he amassed several billion 
dollars 
twice he needed major western military intervention to put down 
revolts and international organizations and opposition leaders 
said he brutally repressed any opposition 
but the united states and other western governments supported 
mobutu who was committed to opposing the expansion of marxism in 
the region zaire has been a conduit of us aid to antimarxist 
guerrillas in angola zaires southern neighbor 
critics of mobutu in the us congress say the radical decline 
in eastwest tensions has made cultivation of mobutu unnecessary

later this week a command radioed 
from earth will open the lens cap on the hubble space telescope and 
allow the first light from space to strike its mirror 
if telescopes have a mostimportant moment that will be it it 
will mean that hubble flying free 380 miles above the world has 
opened its eyes to the heavens and is ready to make discoveries not 
yet imagined 
nasa is so concerned about that lens cap opening it is keeping 
the shuttle discovery in the neighborhood just in case astronauts 
bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be suited up ready to 
walk in space to open the cap formally called an aperture door 
by hand 
opening that door is step 65 in a sequence nasa laid out to 
activate and check out the 15 billion telescope and its five 
instruments before the shuttle pulls away and leaves the hubble to 
its own devices 
the instruments themselves mounted behind the telescopes 945 
inch mirror were warmed up tuesday soon after the shuttle lifted 
into a sunny florida sky their ability to communicate with the 
ground was checked onebyone 
one of the instruments the widefield and planetary camera 
operates in two modes as its name implies in the widefield mode 
the camera can photograph a giant galaxy 60 million light years 
from earth how far is that light travels 5900000000000 miles 
in one year 
with this instrument astronomers plan to look into crowded 
centers of galaxies and search for diskshaped formations of gas 
and dust around young stars where new planetary systems may be 
forming if they discover a star like our sun and planets like our 
earth they may be on the trail of other life in the universe 
in its planetary mode the camera can photograph entire 
hemispheres of any planet in our solar system in a single exposure 
scientists will be able to take photographs of neptune as sharp and 
detailed as those taken by the two voyager spacecraft when each was 
only five days away 
a second instrument is the faintobject camera provided by the 
european space agency it is designed to detect distant objects and 
extends the reach of the telescope to the greatest possible 
distance 
this camera will photograph stars seven times farther away than 
any before it many stars and galaxies that are considered faint 
by present standards will be almost blazing light sources to the 
faintobject camera says a nasa brochure 
a third instrument the faintobject spectrograph will analyze 
the light from individual stars and nebulae in our galaxy and those 
nearby and provide data to deduce their physical and chemical 
properties it will investigate more distant galaxies and study 
light from quasars and whole galaxies 
the spectrograph also will be used to study erupting stars 
supernova and determine the rate at which the expansion of the 
universe has been slowing over billions of years 
its conclusions will help settle a scientific argument over 
nothing less than the likely fate of the universe if the 
deceleration rate is small then the universe will continue to 
expand forever if it is as fast as some scientists maintain then 
the expansion will come to a halt eventually and the universe will 
begin to contract 
a fourth instrument the goddard high resolution spectrograph 
sees only ultraviolet light to examine physical and chemical 
conditions in objects it looks at it will be able to observe trace 
substances in interstellar space that cant be detected any other 
way when the telescope is tracking a bright comet the 
spectrograph will search for evidence that comets were formed from 
interstellar matter and it will measure temperatures of explosion 
in the upper atmospheres of red dwarf stars 
the simplest instrument on the hubble containing no moving 
parts is the highspeed photometer a light meter that measures 
the intensity wavelength and other properties of light it will 
measure the structure and ongoing physical processes in interacting 
binary stars including those that may contain black holes 
with this instrument astronomers will study many of the exotic 
phenomena in the ring systems of saturn jupiter and uranus and 
also will determine the diameters of stars 
there is effectively a sixth instrument on the hubble fine 
guidance sensors that point the telescope with precision from 
washington claim scientists the sensors could spot a dime in the 
window of the world trade center in manhattan and hold it steady 
in sight for 24 hours

chancellor helmut kohl and east german 
prime minister lothar de maiziere on tuesday named july 2 as the 
day for economic and social union of the two germanys a west 
german spokesman said 
union in those areas will bring the divided nation a long way 
toward full unification after more than four decades of separation 
following the horror of the nazi dictatorship and defeat in world 
war ii 
the issue of political union or holding an election to form a 
single government remains to be worked out 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze joined by their colleagues from 
britain france and the two german states are scheduled to meet in 
bonn on may 5 
there they will try to resolve difficult international aspects 
of unification including germanys future military stance 
while early july has frequently been mentioned as a goal for 
economic monetary and social union meaning the coordination of 
social benefits such as unemployment and old age pensions 
tuesdays statement was the first confirmation of a specific target 
date 
delegations from both germanys are to meet in east berlin on 
wednesday to negotiate over how to best introduce the powerhouse 
west german mark into east germanys battered economy 
the basis of the talks will be bonns proposal for monetary 
union which calls for a basic 11 exchange rate of east german 
marks for west marks for wages salaries and pensions in east 
germany 
the announcements made by west german government spokesman 
dieter vogel followed three hours of private talks between kohl 
and de maiziere de maiziere was visiting bonn for the first time 
as east germanys prime minister 
vogel said kohl and de maiziere spoke in a friendly atmosphere 
de maiziere talking to reporters after the meeting was asked 
whether he had accepted the west german governments latest 
proposal for monetary union 
there was nothing for me to accept the chancellor presented 
the governments suggestions and well negotiate about them de 
maiziere said 
he said hammering out a monetary union would require many 
talks and negotiations 
the west german monetary union proposal announced monday 
represented a surprising concession to east german demands east 
germans had feared that the exchange rate would be one west german 
mark for two east german marks a rate that was initially proposed 
by west germanys central bank 
the 11 rate will be limited however in the case of savings to 
2300 per person this angered east germans 
initial steps also were taken tuesday toward a political union 
between the two countries kohl assigned a working group to put 
together a proposal for conducting the first allgerman elections 
government spokesman hans klein announced 
the group will include representatives from all parties in the 
coalition the conservative christian democratic union the 
christian social union and the centrist free democrat party 
kohls conservative christian democratic union favors holding 
the first allgerman elections at the end of 1991 after west 
germanys national elections in december 1990 
the free democrats however want an allgerman election in 
early 1991 skipping the west german national elections this year 
in another development east german foreign minister markus 
meckel arrived in bonn for a meeting with his west german 
counterpart hansdietrich genscher 
the talks focused on the merging of germany within the framework 
of a united europe and the socalled two plus four talks on may 
5 between the two germanys the united states the soviet union 
britain and france 
one of the main stumbling blocks is the military status of a 
united germany the united states has insisted that germany be a 
member of nato while the soviets have demanded that a united 
germany be neutral

a preliminary investigation indicates 
arson caused the fire that killed the wife of a solidarity 
journalist who investigated the secret police a prosecutor told 
polish television 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki established a commission to 
monitor the investigation into the fire that broke out sunday in 
the suburban warsaw apartment of jerzy jachowicz an editor at the 
daily gazeta wyborcza and his wife maria 
mrs jachowicz 49 died after awaking to find the hallway in 
flames and jumping from a thirdfloor window authorities said 
jachowicz escaped serious injury the couples 14yearold 
daughter was hospitalized after jumping with her mother 
deputy general prosecutor aleksander herzog told state 
television monday that investigators have concluded with a 
probability close to certainty that the cause of the fire was 
criminal arson 
he said the fire appeared to have been started by a petroleum 
product 
on the prime ministers commission with herzog are top officials 
of the interior and justice ministries 
jachowicz has written numerous articles about the interior 
ministry long used by the communist authorities to repress dissent 
in poland and widely distrusted 
steps have been taken by the solidarity government to make the 
ministry adjust to postcommunist poland earlier this month the 
parliament voted to restructure the ministry and disband the secret 
police 
the interior ministry is still headed by gen czeslaw kiszczak 
a former communist who was retained by the new government

natos top military commander said 
tuesday negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear arms in europe 
could begin soon after the expected signing this year of an accord 
slashing tanks troops and other nonnuclear forces 
us gen john galvin the supreme allied commander in europe 
also indicated he still supports a new generation of shortrange 
nuclear missiles but he acknowledged the difficulty in deploying 
them in europe 
in my opinion there is not unanimous political acceptance at 
this time of the missile in europe galvin said in an interview 
at the headquarters of the north atlantic treaty organization 
with declining eastwest tensions the bush administration said 
last week it was postponing development of the weapon a more 
powerful version of the aging lance surfacetosurface missile 
the weapon has become increasingly unpopular in west germany 
where most of the missiles would be based 
galvin said he believes the new weapon would be an excellent 
way to support the mission of nuclear deterrence and nuclear 
defense 
but i would have to say in all objectivity that one weapon 
doesnt make or break an alliance he said if the question is 
can i carry out my mission without the followontolance the 
answer is yes 
the lance was introduced in 1972 and military analysts have 
said it will become obsolete in 1995 its maximum range is about 75 
miles 
its replacement would be designed to hit a target more than 250 
miles away just under the limits of the 1987 intermediaterange 
nuclear forces treaty 
galvin predicted that eastwest negotiations to pare battlefield 
nuclear weapons in europe would begin sooner rather than later 
president bush and other nato leaders agreed last spring that 
bargaining on nuclear arms would not occur until implementation had 
begun of a treaty on reducing tanks artillery troops and other 
conventional forces in europe 
the question becomes what does implementation actually mean 
that probably leaves room for some negotiating as to when it 
would begin galvin said 
he predicted that bargaining could begin very soon after they 
signed a conventional arms treaty 
negotiators for the 16 nato nations and the seven warsaw pact 
countries are pressing at talks in vienna to try to wrap up a 
conventional arms accord by the end of the year possibly in the 
fall 
galvin ruled out a further reduction in the number of soviet and 
american troops stationed in europe in the current round of vienna 
talks 
moscow and washington have agreed to equal ceilings of 195000 
soldiers stationed outside their national territory in central 
europe the united states would maintain an additional 30000 
soldiers outside that zone in britain and southern europe 
there is no other program galvin said it doesnt mean 
that i dont think that sometime in the future we might be in a 
different situation but right now 195000 is it 
he also said he doubted that france would return to natos 
integrated military command despite recent calls from britain for 
it to become a full participant in the alliance 
france has said with great definition that it will not rejoin

us businesses may find they are unable to 
sell american goods in europe if they dont adopt the metric 
system the chairman of a house subcommittee said tuesday 
within the next three or four years the european community 
will have a unified economy larger than our own with unified 
product standards based on metric said rep tim valentine 
dnc chairman of the house science subcommittee on science 
research and technology 
us manufacturers who cannot produce metric goods may then 
find the european door closed to their products 
japanese importers valentine said are already rejecting 
american wood products not measured in metric wood has been a 
major issue in recent us trade negotiations with japan which 
prefers to import lumber and do its own manufacturing 
president bush after his most recent talks on trade with 
japanese leaders repeated support for us conversion to metric 
standards valentine said 
however the congressman questioned whether bush has supported 
his words with action 
j dexter peach assistant comptroller general testified that a 
general accounting office study found little preparedness for a 
1988 law requiring government agencies to be using the metric 
system as much as possible by the end of september 1991 
the department of commerce as the lead agency has not 
demonstrated a real commitment to guiding it and making it happen 
nor have the other federal agencies demonstrated a serious 
commitment to make the transition peach said 
he said the gao study requested by the science committee found 
only two government agencies that have prepared transition plans 
the department of defense and the general services administration 
which does household tasks for many other agencies 
six other agencies have completed guidelines but 27 including 
13 of the 14 major federal departments told peach that more than 
threequarters of the transition work remains to be done

the general accounting office recommended 
tuesday that spending on new homeports be suspended until the navy 
can justify the program in light of changing world conditions and 
cuts in defense spending 
martin m ferber director of the gaos national security and 
international affairs division told a house armed services 
subcommittee that the navy still is relying on a 1982 analysis to 
justify the strategic homeports in six gulf coast cities and in 
staten island ny and everett wash 
we believe it is even more important to revisit that analysis 
now because of the changing worldwide threat declines in the size 
of the navy and budgetary pressures ferber said 
the navy is no longer planning a 600ship fleet he said 
the current fleet is less than 550 ships and further reductions 
are likely 
according to the gao the investigative arm of congress the 
navy had obligations of 488 million for the homeports as of march 
and had spent a total of 2987 million 
of the estimated 799 million cost of developing the eight 
homeports 6247 million already has been appropriated by congress 
and an additional 257 million had been requested for fiscal 1991 
in addition to the 799 million in federal outlays for the 
program the gao said state and local governments have contributed 
1987 million an additional 1736 million in federal funds is 
slated for projects at the new homeports because of recommendations 
of the base closure commission 
the costs of construction and operating the new homeports will 
exceed 1 billion while the cost of not proceeding with the 
homeports has been estimated by the navy as 636 million ferber 
said however some of these sunk costs may be recoverable 
through alternative uses of the facilities built 
jacqueline schafer assistant secretary of the navy for 
installations and environment said the navy believes the new 
homeports are still a valid military objective because they are 
needed to maintain naval forces in a state of readiness during 
peacetime

legislation to ban new billboards along 
federal highways and to empower localities to remove existing signs 
was introduced in the senate on tuesday 
the visual pollution control act of 1990 would place a 
moratorium on construction of new billboards on interstate and 
federal primary highways would call for an accurate count of 
existing billboards and would allow states cities and towns to 
decide whether to remove existing roadway advertising along those 
highways 
billboards all too frequently constitute a blight on a 
community said sen john chafee rri author of the visual 
pollution control act of 1990 he said they have a tremendous 
impact on neighborhoods and therefore neighborhoods should have the 
ability to regulate them 
the legislation cosponsored by sens claiborne pell dri 
lloyd bentson dtexas and mark hatfield rore among others 
would amend the 1965 highway beautification act although that law 
was originally designed to control billboards chafee said the it 
has become so watereddown that the only people who support it 
are the billboard industry 
chafees bill drew the endorsement of houston mayor kathy 
whitmire president of the national conference of mayors and 
alberta tinsleywilliams a county commissioner from detroit 
in houston work on interstate 610 has been delayed because the 
state has refused to buy a billboard which is in the way the sign 
is valued at 19042 by the state and 288000 by the company which 
owns it 
tinsley williams said that in detroits poor largely black 
neighborhoods 60 percent of the billboard advertising is for 
cigarettes or alcohol we want it out of the faces of our 
children she said 
an investigation in north carolina found that 500 billboards 
still stood a year after their permits had been revoked 
according to scenic america a group supporting the bill the 
typical billboard in 1965 was 15 feet tall and 300 square feet 
today the typical billboard stands 50 feet tall usually on 
platforms and is 672 square feet 
chafee acknowledged that overcoming the opposition of the 
advertising lobby will require a concerted effort and he said he 
did not expect his bill to pass this year 
the outdoor advertising association branded the bill 
unconstitutional saying it would violate the fifth amendment by 
allowing states to take down billboards after five years without 
compensating the owner 
according to a federal highway administration survey there are 
394000 billboards on federal and interstate highways across the 
country compared to 11 million in 1965

exxon has balked at providing additional money 
to assess the longterm damage from the exxon valdez oil spill in 
alaska federal officials said tuesday 
the trustees have requested that exxon fund the remaining 20 
million of 1989 costs but so far exxon has declined to respond 
to that request alan raul told the house subcommittee on water 
power and offshore energy resources 
raul general counsel of the agriculture department is a member 
of the interagency trustee council trying to determine the 
environmental damages caused by the massive spill trustees said 
the first year of studies has cost 354 million more than twice 
the amount provided by exxon 
additional damage assessment studies this year could cost 30 
million according to an internal trustee council document made 
public by the house interior and insular affairs subcommittee 
cm harrison executive vice president of exxon co usa told 
the subcommittee that exxon doesnt plan to make further payments 
for damage assessments 
the process has not worked as exxon anticipated harrison 
said in prepared remarks adding that exxon has not had access to 
data collected as part of the assessment process 
exxon agreed shortly after the march 24 1989 spill in alaskas 
prince william sound to provide 15 million for longterm damage 
assessments interior secretary manuel lujan at the time 
characterized the payment as a first step with additional money to 
be sought from the oil company if needed 
the minutes of a march meeting of the trustee council quoted 
justice department officals as advising the council it should not 
expect further money from exxon according to a transcript 
released by the subcommittee 
the costs of damage assessment will be borne by the federal 
government although some of the money likely will be recovered as 
part of the damages sought in a civil suit expected to be filed 
against exxon 
the oil company has spent more than 1 billion to clean up the 
spill which contaminated miles of alaska coastline the justice 
department is pursuing criminal charges against exxon that could 
lead to fines and penalties of more than 600 million 
meanwhile several environmental groups called the federal 
damage assessement process inadequate and said that money shortages 
are causing the trustees to curtail some studies essential to 
determining overall damage to wildlife and natural resources 
the trustees decided at their march meeting not to proceed with 
24 of the 63 damage assessment studies 
the lawyers and not the scientists have driven the assessment 
process said erik olson of the national wildlife federation 
he contended that some of the studies were halted because they 
were too expensive and likely would not produce large payoffs in 
damage recovery as a result of the eventual civil suit against 
exxon 
apparently decisions on which studies to continue are based 
at least in part on financial considerations said robert adler 
a lawyer for the natural resources defense council 
members of the trustee council are officials of the agriculture 
and commerce departments and the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration

solidarity cannot survive unless it makes 
a clean break with the government it created a prominent union 
activist warned tuesday as the labor federations congress neared 
its conclusion 
during the sixday congress delegates have sharply differed 
over what the unions role should be in a postcommunist poland 
whether it should remain actively involved in national politics or 
return to its trade union roots defending workers interests 
the union finds itself losing support among workers because of 
harsh austerity measures introduced by the solidarityled 
government under prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki a former union 
adviser 
the congress was scheduled to end tuesday but organizers said 
it might stretch into wednesday as debates continued on proposals 
for the unions draft constitution and program 
andrzej slowik a solidarity leader from the textile center of 
lodz said the labor movement must limit itself to purely union 
issues and cease trying to protect the government 
during the congress slowik has emerged as the chief rival to 
union leader lech walesa who has advocated a mixed role for the 
union combining politics with trade union issues 
his views appear to be gaining support among the 487 delegates 
even though he finished a distant second to walesa in saturdays 
election for the union chairmanship 
slowik has said it is clear that walesa intends to use the union 
chairmanship as a stepping stone to the presidency of poland 
the sooner walesa leaves us and goes to belvedere the 
presidential palace the bigger the chances to save solidarity 
slowik told the associated press in an interview tuesday 
otherwise solidarity may end its existence at the moment of the 
fall of the mazowiecki government 
walesa has waffled on whether he intends to launch a bid for the 
presidency now held by former communist party leader wojciech 
jaruzelski 
slowik said the union risks losing support if it remains too 
closely linked to the mazowiecki governments economic shock 
therapy program the reforms are aimed at reviving polands 
crisisridden economy and introducing capitalism 
the government has reduced inflation but nearly 300000 people 
or 2 percent of the workforce have lost their jobs so far this 
year as unprofitable stateowned enterprises are forced to close 
during the six days of the congress several more hundred 
unemployed were added in lodz he said 
mazowieckis solidarityled coalition was installed as a result 
of a political compromise struck by walesa in august to give poland 
the east blocs first noncommunistled government 
but recent opinion polls have shown that solidaritys popularity 
is falling as the union is being blamed for unpopular government 
economic measures which have hit hard at industrial workers the 
unions traditional base of support 
slowik said the union is suffering from sagging membership 
because of its leaderships decision to take care of the 
mazowiecki government instead of protecting the workers and its 
continued involvement in grand politics 
since regaining its legal status a year ago solidarity has 
recovered only 22 million of the 10 million members it claimed 
before the december 1981 martial law crackdown that forced the 
union underground for seven years 
slowik said he generally agrees with the governments reforms 
but wants solidarity to do more to protect workers from its 
effects including providing more job retraining programs and 
fighting for alternative factory costsaving steps to avert layoffs 
solidarity leaders close to walesa argue that the 10 million 
membership figure was exaggerated they attribute the membership 
decline to the emergence of many new political parties and 
associations during the past year 
on monday delegates to the congress endorsed a middle road 
passing up the opportunity to either remove the union totally from 
politics or immediately form a political party they approved a 
program plank that gives the union the option to eventually create 
its own political party and support candidates for parliament 
the union cannot leave politics totally but it should become 
more like a trade union especially in the present economic 
situation said delegate andrzej kunkiel from wroclawek in 
western poland 
solidarity which emerged as the east blocs first independent 
trade union during a 1980 strike wave held its only previous 
congress in the fall of 1981 just months before the military 
crackdown

attempt less than 24 hours after their coup was crushed 
a statement broadcast by official radio omdurman said 28 
officers including three retired generals and a brigadier were 
executed by firing squad after a summary courtmartial 
military tribunals continued to work a colonel was acquitted 
but the trial of other officers alleged to be involved in the coup 
was still going on 
lt gen omar hassan elbashirs ruling junta which took power 
in its own coup last june 30 said the coup attempt crushed monday

courtmartial after their arrest monday and that 20 officers and 
civilians arrested after the march incident also were on trial 
the statement did not specify how many suspects remained 
awaiting trial 
on monday elbashir said the abortive coup was masterminded by 
the alliance in coalition with the outlaws 
the alliance was possibly a reference to political parties 
disbanded by elbashir after his junta took control of the country 
june 30 
the government has often used the term outlaws to refer to 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army which has been waging a 
sevenyear insurgency seeking autonomy and greater economic reforms 
for the countrys three southern provinces 
the government statement tuesday also did not make clear why 
col hassan abdalla atta a pilot was acquitted there were 
reports he was granted clemency in exchange for testifying against 
the others 
death by firing squad has been implemented and the trials are 
still going on for the rest of the participants said the 
statement read on radio omdurman and distributed by the sudan news 
agency 
the executed officers included the two retired senior officers 
accused of leading the alleged plot they and the others were 
charged with high treason and mutiny against the legitimate 
government the official statement said 
the alleged coup leaders were identified as retired maj gen 
abdulkadir alkadaru and brigadier mohammed osman hamid karrar 
other retired flag officers reported executed were retired gens 
khalid alzain ali a pilot and osman idris balol 
in addition four colonels one retired and five lieutenant 
colonels two of whom were retired went before the firing squad 
a member of elbashirs 15officer military council brigadier 
osman ahmed alhassan promised a fair but prompt trial to anyone 
involved in the abortive coup attempt he spoke in an interview 
published tuesday in the newspaper alsudan alhadith 
mohamed khogali salihein the information minister insisted the 
alleged plotters were persuaded to surrender with no bloodshed or 
casualties 
but informed sources in khartoum on monday reported limited 
gunfire exchanges when the plotters tried to take over khartoum 
international airport and radio omdurman the official government 
station 
a third group of officers who tried to enter the downtown 
headquarters of the armed forces general command shot a guard in 
the hand before they were overpowered the sources said that group 
apparently was searching for elbashir 
the coup attempt started around midnight sunday the government 
closed the airport cut communications with the outside and blocked 
bridges for several hours 
by 7 am monday life was back to normal in the capital 
on tuesday radio omdurman broadcast a stream of telegrams in 
support of elbashir a progovernment demonstration was announced

china agreed tuesday to provide credits to the 
soviet union to pay for the import of chinese consumer goods the 
official soviet news agency tass said 
the announcement came on the second day of premier li pengs 
visit here the first by a chinese head of government in 26 years 
the soviet union suffers from a chronic shortage of basic 
consumer goods ranging from toothpaste to matches and has 
increasingly turned to foreigners for help 
tass did not say what goods china would provide or give the 
monetary value of the deal 
for its part the soviet union will extend a credit to china for 
building a nuclear power station in china tass said the news 
agency also did not say how much that deal was worth or where the 
plant would be built 
the agreements on the credits were signed by soviet external 
economic relations minister konstantin katushev and chinese deputy 
foreign trade minister li lanqin tass said 
li met tuesday with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who 
visited china last may 
lis fourday trip is intended to ease border tensions and 
improve relations between the longtime rivals for leadership of the 
communist world 
a good and interesting meeting thats how it was assessed by 
the participants soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim 
perfiliev told a moscow briefing 
perfiliev said the leaders discussed further military cutbacks 
on the sovietchinese border and plans for strengthening economic 
ties 
tass said li and soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov signed an 
agreement on cooperation through the year 2000 that covers fuel 
and power metallurgy transport communications agriculture 
electronics forestry and environmental protection coooperation 
also is planned in health and space exploration 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and his chinese 
counterpart qian qichen signed an agreement on mututal reduction 
of armed forces and military confidencebuilding measures along the 
two countries border the two countries have been negotiating the 
troop reductions for several years 
tuesdays agreement said soviet and chinese armed forces would 
be kept to a minimum corresponding to normal goodneighborly 
relations 
in their meeting gorbachev and li agreed that there is no 
single model for realizing socialist ideas each country has its 
own history own specifics own starting level of development and 
its impossible not to consider it tass said 
that theme was also evident monday when li made a speech 
emphasizing that his country and the soviet union have the right to 
tailor reforms to their own needs 
both are socialist countries and conduct reform and 
perestroika in accordance with the realities of their countries 
peng said in remarks reported by tass 
western diplomats in beijing said china has stressed it would 
never be a docile soviet ally as in the 1950s 
the ideological hardliners who now rule china reportedly blame 
gorbachev for the fall of communist parties in eastern europe and 
consider perestroika gorbachevs program of political and 
economic reform as a threat to socialism 
china and the soviet union split over ideological differences in 
1960 and fought a brief border war in 1969 in 1972 china restored 
relations with the united states in part because thenleader mao 
tsetung saw the soviet union as chinas most serious military 
threat

the state department responding to an 
overture from albanias hardline marxist government said tuesday 
it is ready to pursue discussions with that country on 
normalizing diplomatic relations 
in a speech last week albanian president ramiz alia had 
expressed interest in establishing relations with both the united 
states and the soviet union 
the united states and albania have had no diplomatic ties since 
1939 albania is one of a handful of countries with which the 
united states does not have such ties 
since alia came to office in 1985 he has slowly attempted to 
end the isolationist policies imposed by his predecessor enver 
hoxha albania broke relations with the soviet union in 1961 
because hoxha felt that moscow was deviating from marxist ideology 
after noting alias expression of interest in restoring ties 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said as the 
united states has stated in the past our door is open to the 
resumption of diplomatic relations and we are ready to pursue 
discussions toward this end 
alias speech last week followed a sixmonth period in which 
albanian officials had been sending out feelers through third 
parties expressing interest in broader contacts with the united 
states a state department official said 
the third parties included foreign diplomats and albanian 
americans who visited albania the officials were unable to cite 
any direct discussions between us and albanian officials 
another sign of the more flexible albanian attitude was its 
decision to permit rep joseph p kennedy dmass to visit 
kennedys office said tuesday he expects to visit there in the 
first week of june 
the albanian overtures to the united states apparently began 
after other communist regimes in east europe collapsed unlike 
those other governments however albania has never been an east 
bloc member instead pursuing a policy of selfsufficiency 
in his speech last week alia noted the wide gap that has 
existed between albania and the superpowers and said that we meet 
friendship with friendship 
he said that as a result of recent international developments 
the problem of the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with 
the united states of america and the soviet union is on the 
agenda 
lia also expressed interest in joining the socalled helsinki 
process the 35nation conclave that meets to discuss issues 
related to european security and cooperation albania is the only 
european country that is not a member of the helsinki group 
a state department report on human rights conditions worldwide 
released in february described albania as a marxistleninist 
dictatorship where the 33 million residents are permitted only 
very limited political and civil rights 
in her statement ms tutwiler said that diplomatic relations do 
not constitute an endorsement of the policies of a given government 
establishment of diplomatic relations would create the 
opportunity for dialogue through which we would be able to 
communicate our concerns and encourage respect for human rights in 
albania she said

daniel ortega because of her powerful symbolic value she was the 
one person on whom all sectors of the loose opposition coalition 
could agree 
she showed mettle if not political sophistication throughout a 
tough campaign she stumped the country despite a broken knee 
invariably dressed in white mrs chamorro was lifted onto 
platforms at rallies in her wheelchair one political analyst 
described her as a virgin mary figure in his postmortem of her 
feb 25 landslide victory 
mrs chamorro the youngest daughter of a provincial landowning 
family never envisioned herself in a political role she was 
raised to be a wife and mother a role she gladly embraced after 
marrying chamorro 
he was my first love my first boyfriend said mrs 
chamorro who visits his grave every week 
chamorro publisher of the daily newspaper la prensa was also 
one of the most prominent opponents of the somoza family 
dictatorship mrs chamorro stayed in the background 
chamorro was assassinated in january 1978 presumably on orders 
from dictator anastasio somoza when somoza was ousted the 
following year mrs chamorro was a member of the first ruling 
junta 
she quit after nine months later saying the leftist sandinistas 
betrayed her husbands democratic ideals 
she enjoys the comparison to another political widow who led a 
movement that ousted an entrenched government corazon aquino of 
the philippines 
like many nicaraguan families the chamorros were divided by the 
revolution 
daughter claudia and son carlos fernando publisher of the 
sandinista party newspaper barricada are dedicated sandinistas 
another son pedro joaquin chamorro jr was a leader of the 
usbacked contras and daughter cristiana is the editor of la 
prensa an opposition newspaper during sandinista rule 
in many ways family is still the center of mrs chamorros 
life she relies for political advice and counsel on a tight inner 
circle that includes pedro joaquin jr and cristianas husband 
antonio lacayo 
she has taken very little direct hand in transferofpower 
negotiations with the sandinistas and is known for preferring to 
discuss her grandchildren while aides huddle over policy 
but the prominence of her family advisers has created divisions 
within the united national opposition the 14party coalition she 
led to victory one of mrs chamorros greatest problems as 
president may be navigating the political thicket of warring 
interests within uno 
other challenges that might daunt even the most skilled 
politician await her she must rebuild a shattered economy and 
contend with the sandinistas in their new role as a solid 
opposition force 
after years of war revolution and poverty nicaragua is like a 
divided family mrs chamorro may lack political sophistication 
but she understands divided families 
when ortega came to visit her after his election defeat he was 
not at all sure how she would receive him after the bitter campaign 
papito come here i love you mrs chamorro exclaimed 
hugging her defeated opponent 
her mission she says is to reconcile the nation to bring it 
peace and one of the first steps toward this goal she said this 
week will be the declaration of a general amnesty 
peace reconciliation and pardon will be the parameters of my 
government she said 
i pardon my husbands killers

a dispute has flared up over the rights to a 
videotape showing the execution of nicolae and elena ceausescu 
pitting the head of romanian television against a french tv network 
that broadcast the footage 
the 90minute tape aired sunday by the private tf1 network 
depicted the secret trial execution and burial of the romanian 
communist dictator and his wife dec 25 at a military base outside 
bucharest 
the network claims a sundaynight record 10 million people 
watched the broadcast the ceausescus final hours 
tf1 says it paid 9000 to an unidentified romanian for the tape 
after an austrian network rejected it network officials called the 
price cheap and billed the broadcast sunday as a world 
exclusive 
but razvan theodorescu head of staterun free romanian 
television said monday that tf1 had purchased an illegal copy of 
the tape undercutting a deal being negotiated with a french sales 
agent over world rights to the film 
the rights to this cassette belong to the romanian 
government theodorescu said in bucharest before leaving on a 
trip to paris its immoral to want to make money with a historic 
document reflecting the drama lived through by the romanian 
people 
he said tf1 was duped into buying a pirate cassette and 
accused those who sold it of criminal behavior 
patrick le lay presidentdirector general of tf1 denied that 
any illegal act was committed 
what was proposed to us was the uncut cassette of the trial 
and we havent pirated anybody he said monday 
the tape shows ceausescu weeping and his wife screaming for 
mercy as guards tied their hands shortly before their execution 
the camera focused on elena ceausescu lying in a stream of blood 
after a firing squad gunned down the couple 
extracts of the tape first aired in december but the long 
version broadcast by tf1 showed for the first time the full trial 
of the couple by the secret militarycivilian tribunal that 
sentenced them to death 
the showtrial atmosphere and the brutal graphic images of the 
execution drew criticism in the french media 
the conservative daily le figaro called it a political trial 
that bears no relation to justice it would doubtless have been 
better to kill the ceausescus right away than to put on this 
macabre farce 
the tf1 broadcast scooped free romanian television which aired 
the footage later sunday to mark the fourmonth anniversary of the 
revolution that ended ceausescus 25year rule 
the french network billed its version as the complete 
definitive account of the couples final hours 
but theodorescu claimed after arriving in paris late monday that 
a more complete tape contains additional debate among the tribunal 
members over charges that the ceausescus committed genocide against 
the romanian people 
the romanian government will continue distribution negotiations 
over the longer tape with french agent jeanloup sulitzer 
theodorescu said earnings will go toward technological 
improvements in romanian television

the house approved a nonbinding resolution 
tuesday asserting that a united jerusalem is the capital of israel 
a position at odds with official us policy 
the 378 to 34 vote with six members voting present came 
despite arguments that such a statement by congress would cause 
resentment among arab states and complicate bush administration 
efforts to achieve a mideast peace 
the resolution was identical to one approved march 22 by the 
senate senate minority leader bob dole rkan later complained 
that the move had damaged peace efforts and said he regretted his 
support for it 
jerusalem regarded as a holy city by christians moslems and 
jews has since the 1967 arabisraeli war been under israeli 
control and unfettered access to all holy sites is allowed 
us policy holds that jerusalems status must be determined 
through negotiations among all parties and does not recognize it as 
the israeli capital 
rep eliot engel dny and the chief house sponsor of the 
resolution said he acted because president bush had called into 
question jerusalems status by linking predominantly arab east 
jerusalem to the occupied west bank in a statement about israeli 
settlements 
jerusalem is the heart and soul of israel engel said during 
a brief debate on the resolution if the israelis are willing to 
take risks for peace they need to know the united states will 
stand by them not pull the rug out from under them 
but rep david obey dwis said any attempt by congress to 
give formal institutional support to israels claim that jerusalem 
is its capital would unnecessarily inflame an already hostile 
situation 
for america to play a constructive role we need to have good 
relations with a number of parties in the middle east not just 
one we must be credible to all parties not just one 
obey said the nonbinding resolution was nothing more than an 
institutional press release 
rep david bonior dmich said congress should be discussing 
the likud partys efforts to provide aid for settling jews in the 
christian sector of jerusalem while lying lying about the 
action lawmakers should be debating the wisdom of approving 400 
million in us loan guarantees to house new israeli settlers he 
said 
the resolution is an affront to the arab community the 
christian community and the greek orthodox community we should 
be seeking to bring the parties together instead of polarizing the 
situation bonior said 
similar comments by dole last week touched off a dispute among 
republicans with a group of house gop leaders criticizing the 
senator for not supporting israel strongly enough 
in beirut a group calling itself islamic jihad 
movementjerusalem threatened to launch attacks against americans 
worldwide unless the senate reverses its action 
the american senate should reverse its decision in 10 days or 
else every american inside and outside moslem countries will be a 
target of terrorism and revenge the group said in a statement 
delivered to a beirut newspaper

sen bob kerrey dneb said tuesday that 
there will be a farm crisis in two years if government support for 
agriculture isnt increased 
president bush however disagreed 
there are many things i respect about senator kerrey bush 
said sometimes we have a philosophical difference of opinion i 
have a different view on this 
kerrey has introduced legislation being used by the senate 
agriculture committee to prepare its commodities section of the 
1990 farm bill he made his comments to the national association of 
agricultural journalists bush addressed the group later in the day 
farm economy kerrey said has improved considerably since the 
early 1980s however he said the recovery was fragile and that 12 
billion is needed annually over the fiveyear life of the farm bill 
to assure stability 
if you dont provide this level of funding in two years you 
are going to see this recovery vanish kerrey said 
the budget the administration sent to congress in january calls 
for 102 billion to be spent on commodity programs in the next 
fiscal year the crops protected by those subsidies are the big 
money crops wheat corn cotton soybeans and rice 
kerrey said that failed farming operations brought on by 
insufficient government support would cost more taxpayer money in 
the long run than the annual 12 billion hes advocating 
he criticized agriculture secretary clayton yeutter as an 
advocate for the free market instead of the farmer 
yeutter who has a family farm in kerreys home state said farm 
income need not be dependent on the government 
theres a market out there said yeutter who appeared with 
bush all of us are concerned about farm income 
yeutter said it was impossible to predict the agricultural 
economic situation in the united states beyond the next fiscal year 
because the outcome of international trade talks the uruguay 
round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt are 
not complete 
the bush administration has been working through gatt to open 
the international marketplace by removing subsidies which yeutter 
and other officials say distort prices

for an hour tuesday the supreme court 
grappled with an important libel law issue contained in a former 
high school wrestling coachs 15yearold lawsuit against an ohio 
newspaper 
the court is being asked to decide whether the constitutions 
freespeech protections immunize all expressions of opinion as 
opposed to assertions of fact from libel lawsuits 
first however the justices may have to tell judges nationwide 
how to distinguish fact from opinion 
the factopinion distinction is important courts traditionally 
have barred libel suits over expressions of opinion even though the 
high court never has said explicitly that such protection is 
constitutionally required 
the justices spent much of tuesdays argument session trying to 
figure out whether to put a fact or opinion tag on a 1975 
sports column that accused michael milkovich of lying under oath 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices antonin scalia 
and anthony m kennedy asked the most questions all three seemed 
to consider the suedover statement an assertion of fact 
questions from justices john paul stevens sandra day oconnor 
and byron r white were more difficult to characterize justices 
william j brennan thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun asked 
no questions 
the suedover column was written by ted diadiun and appeared in 
the news herald of lake county published by the lorain journal co 
milkovich was coaching maple heights high schools wrestling 
team at a 1974 home meet against mentor high school when a melee 
involving both teams and spectators erupted several wrestlers were 
hospitalized 
diadiun who was at the meet wrote several articles criticizing 
milkovichs conduct 
in a jan 8 1975 column diadiun accused the coach and h don 
scott then superintendent of the maple heights public schools of 
lying to a judge who overturned disciplinary measures against the 
maple heights team 
during extensive litigation milkovich won two preliminary 
rounds before the ohio supreme court in a 1984 decision the state 
court ruled that diadiuns statements about milkovich were reported 
as fact not opinion 
but in ruling on scotts related libel suit two years later the 
ohio supreme court reversed its 1984 ruling and said diadiuns 
statements were expressions of his opinion 
in an unusual move the ohio court used its aug 6 1986 
decision in scotts case to doom as well milkovichs suit against 
the newspaper and diadiun 
holding up a 1975 headline that said milkovich beat the law 
with the big lie milkovich attorney brent english of cleveland 
told the justices this is quintessentially an assertion of 
fact 
but richard panza of lorain ohio argued for the newspaper and 
diadiun that when people read sports columns they expect to read 
opinion 
gusts of laughter filled the courtroom after justice kennedy 
responded i gave up reading sports columns because theres 
nothing but legal news in them 
panzas most persistent interrogator was justice scalia who at 
one point asked him doesnt it trouble you that peoples 
reputations can be destroyed this way 
panza said yes it does trouble me he then quickly added 
that the column at issue was not libelous 
diadiun 42 and now an editor with the cleveland plain dealer 
watched the session from the courtrooms press section 
milkovich 68 and recovering from triple bypass heart surgery 
did not attend in a recent interview he told the new york times 
he was too weak to make the trip from his maple heights home 
a decision is expected by july 
the case is milkovich vs lorain journal co 89645

thousands of anticommunist 
demonstrators regrouped in a main bucharest square hours after 
being dispersed by riot police tuesday to demand the resignation of 
interim president ion iliescu 
about 3500 demonstrators waved their fists and cheered as one 
speaker equated the national salvation front iliescus party 
with the soviet kgb many shouted down with communism 
it was the third day of nearly constant protest against iliescu 
and the front which are linked in the minds of many romanians with 
past communist excesses 
iliescu was appointed interim president in the wake of the 
bloody december revolution that overthrew dictator nicolae 
ceausescu he served under ceausescu but fell out of favor and was 
demoted to lesser jobs in the communist party 
his communist past and that of other front officials makes them 
suspect in the eyes of those romanians who claim the front has been 
infiltrated by marxists paying only lip service to democracy 
in a morning session of parliament nica leon president of the 
liberal democratic party and a member of the governing council of 
national unity said the protesters rejected what they considered 
the communist elite still leading the country 
those people want the former communists toppled from the 
leadership he told the council the council in which the front 
shares power with opposition groups is acting as a makeshift 
parliament until elections scheduled for may 20 
iliescu described the protesters as thugs that drew 
protests from opposing legislators who noted that ceausescu used 
such language to label his political opponents 
the demonstrations at university square began sunday and lasted 
uninterrupted until tuesday at dawn when clubwielding helmeted 
riot police forcibly dispersed about 200 protesters who had 
remained in the square 
protesters began reassembling during the morning and continued 
their rally into tuesday evening 
it was the first time since ceausescus overthrow that police 
force was used to break up an anticommunist street protest 
the demonstration was the chief topic during a session of the 
interim parliament that continued into the evening and was 
broadcast live by state television 
the inspector general of police identified only as gen 
diamandescu said nobody was beaten during tuesdays police 
intervention but three policemen were hospitalized after being 
injured by demonstrators 
that assertion was disputed both by legislators and by 
demonstrators who said in interviews that they had been beaten 
this morning the policemen came and clubbed us into the 
ground silviu galniceanu a 23yearold photographer told the 
associated press 
in a related development ion ratiu the presidential candidate 
of the national peasants party in the may 20 elections said his 
life had been threatened by a mob instigated by the front 
ratiu a romanian millionaire who returned from decades of 
british selfexile this year said he had to be spirited out of a 
police station in buzau about 120 miles northeast of bucharest in 
a milk van after an angry crowd threatened to storm the station 
i thought well be lucky if we get away with our lives 
said ratiu 72 he said he planned to take a personal physician 
along on future campaign trips because of fears of similar threats 
the fervently anticommunist national peasant party claims about 
600000 members making them the chief rivals of the front which 
asserts it has 800000 followers

the senate agriculture committee voted tuesday 
to extend government programs for wool mohair and honey for five 
years with virtually no changes 
the wool and mohair title of the 1990 farm bill is 
essentially a fiveyear extension of the program for wool in the 
1985 farm bill said sen patrick leahy dvt 
the measure 
authorizes loans purchases and payments by the agriculture 
department to help the wool and mohair industry 
sets a payment rate that would be the difference between the 
national average of all domestic wool receipts and the price the 
government predetermined that producers should get each producers 
payment from the government would be calculated by applying this 
rate to net proceeds for wool sold the preceding year 
the honey section of the farm bill also would be little changed 
from current policies 
the price support for honey has dropped an average 5 percent 
each year for five years under the new legislation support prices 
would be frozen at 5686 cents a pound through 1995 
loan repayment rates would be unchanged

senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
told his divided panel tuesday that president bush wasnt yet 
serious enough about cutting the deficit to warrant a white house 
budget summit 
summitry simply doesnt make sense unless all sides are 
serious said sasser dtenn as his committee began work on its 
version of the 12 trillion fiscal 1991 spending plan 
at this point at least the administration isnt serious 
about it 
sasser presented the committee with a series of budget options 
cutting the deficit up to 50 billion in the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 the pentagon would account for up to 20 billion of that 
savings a level conservatives appear unwilling to accept 
the congress is not going to adopt those numbers said sen 
phil gramm rtexas 
he and most other republicans led by sen pete v domenici of 
new mexico the senior republican on the panel made clear the gop 
wont support the democrats budget 
domenici said he hoped the committee would act quickly so talks 
with the white house could begin 
we are not going to be obstructionist on this side domenici 
said 
the spectre of a summer white house summit was raised on the 
senate floor tuesday as the two parties settled a dispute that was 
holding up action on the child care and central american aid bills 
senate republicans backed off a threat to force a vote on bushs 
capital gains tax cut as part of the child care bill in exchange 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine assured minority leader 
bob dole of kansas that the tax cut would be part of any summit on 
the big issues 
if such discussions do occur i would urge that any and all 
matters be put on the table mitchell said 
white house budget director richard darman has been agitating 
for a budget summit apparently in part because of a deteriorating 
economic picture 
darman last week criticized the plan passed by the house budget 
committee as inadequate because it relied on the administrations 
own faulty economic projections 
hes getting nervous in the service sen ernest f 
hollings dsc said tuesday of darmans maneuvering away from 
his own position 
hollings described the senate committee as all over the lot 
in its efforts to draft a budget with several democrats 
including himself proposing their own plans 
sasser expressed confidence a consensus would emerge on a plan 
with about 40 billion in deficit reduction enough to satisfy the 
requirements of the grammrudman budget law he declined to say 
what he thought would make up the package 
the house could begin debate as early as wednesday on its budget 
the house plan envisions about 2955 billion in military 
spending next year more than 3 billion more than sasser is 
proposing bush asked for about 303 billion 
sasser like the house and bush is proposing about 14 billion 
in new taxes next year while bush says the capital gains cut would 
raise a big chunk of his revenue the democrats arent saying which 
taxes they would raise

condemned murderers who waive their right to 
appeal and say they want to die may be executed even if no appeals 
court reviews their cases the supreme court ruled tuesday 
the decision will let arkansas authorities execute a man who 
killed 16 relatives and acquaintances during a 1987 rampage no 
state appeals court has reviewed the validity of his convictions or 
sentence 
by a 72 vote the justices ruled that only convicted mass 
murderer r gene simmons and not fellow death row inmate jonas 
whitmore has the legal standing to challenge simmons death 
sentence 
whitmore mounted his challenge even though simmons prefers death 
to end the torture and suffering in me whitmore had asked the 
justices to rule that state appeals courts must review all death 
sentences even when not asked to do so by the condemned murderer 
in fact many states provide automatic appellate review in 
capital cases regardless of the defendants wishes but whitmore 
trying to stand in for simmons had argued that such review is 
constitutionally required 
the court did not address the constitutional issue ruling 
instead that whitmore cannot make such an argument in simmons 
behalf 
whitmore having failed to establish that simmons is 
mentally unable to proceed on his own behalf does not have the 
legal standing to proceed chief justice william h rehnquist 
wrote for the court 
in other decisions the court 
ruled 63 in case that could affect millions of dollars in 
movie industry profits that distributors of the alfred hitchcock 
thriller rear window must share with a literary agent earnings 
from the 1954 films rerelease 
ruled 62 that the us territory of guam and its officials may 
not be sued for allegedly violating a muchused federal civil 
rights law 
the decision in the death penalty case lifted a stay the 
justices had imposed on the eve of simmons scheduled execution 
last year arkansas officials will be free to schedule a new 
execution date as soon as they officially receive word of the 
courts ruling 25 days from tuesday 
justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan who oppose 
capital punishment in all circumstances dissented from tuesdays 
ruling 
the court needlessly abdicates its grave responsibility to 
ensure that no person is wrongly executed marshall wrote for the 
two 
simmons 49 killed his wife three sons four daughters a 
soninlaw a daughterinlaw and four grandchildren at his home 
near dover ark he killed two acquaintances in the nearby town of 
russellville the victims all slain in the days surrounding 
christmas 1987 were shot or strangled 
he consistently has refused to appeal his convictions and death 
sentence 
we are free to execute mr simmons as long as he wishes to be 
executed james lee a spokesman for state attorney general steve 
clark said after learning of tuesdays ruling 
the sister of simmons slain wife becky said she was relieved 
by the decision 
all i can say is i know he wants to die and its now one 
chapter i know will be closed said viola oshields of fort 
payne ala its been a most long very hard three years 
mrs oshields said she wont tell her mother 81yearold maye 
novak of briggsdale colo about the ruling until a new execution 
date is set 
she has not been well since all this happened and maybe this 
will relieve some of the stress and pain shes gone through mrs

five grade school youngsters wearing crisp 
white uniforms bowed stiffly before members of a house 
appropriations subcommittee tuesday and recited four daily 
affirmations from their lessons in discipline lessons that 
committee members applauded 
i am smart because i always learn something good everyday i 
am perfect because i never make mistakes knowingly i like myself 
because i always take action to make things happen i am happy that 
i am me the children said 
the youngsters from washingtons amidon elementary school gave a 
brief demonstration of what they have been learning in a joy of 
discipline program at their school offered by jhoon rhee who 
describes himself as the father of tae kwon do a korean style of 
unarmed combat in the united states 
rhee interspersed his testimony before the subcommittee on 
labor health and human services education and related agencies 
with the demonstrations he said he wants to help restore the 
forgotten good old american custom of respect as well as 
classroom discipline and motivation by getting schools to offer 
attitude classes 
i sincerely believe that the first thing we should teach our 
children is the purpose of life and the second the way to reach 
that purpose and the third how to enjoy the process rhee said 
also performing was rhees star pupil marvin white who 
demonstrated his skills of breaking boards without the benefits of 
arms and with only one leg 
the subcommittee room exploded into applause with various 
congressmen offering words of praise 
master rhee youre good for this country said subcommittee 
chairman william natcher dky 
rep silvio conte rmass added youre helping to instill 
confidence in youngsters thats something thats really needed 
rhee who has instructed members of congress in martial arts for 
25 years said his program was developed through trial and error 
and is saturated with the philosophies and strategies of tae kwon 
do 
the children learn to pay undivided attention to the 
teacher love and respect the teacher and are taught to separate 
license an act approved by the animal instinct from freedom 
an act approved by a conscience he said 
rhee who became an american citizen in 1973 suggested that 
american schools teach the attitude class an hour a day 
children are taught selfdiscipline and selfrespect which are 
the foundations for all learning our children must be taught to 
respect their parents teachers elders peers and evertying in the 
universe he said 
the house subcommittee hearing was one of a series on the 
proposed budgets for the labor health and human services and 
education departments for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the 
proposed education department budget is 246 billion up from 
241 billion in the current year

pedro mahumane walked through a crowd on a 
busy square tuesday and for once failed to draw stares from the 
people around him 
people see me they know i am a foreigner said the 
28yearold mozambican today we are all foreigners 
mahumane was among an estimated 1500 africans vietnamese 
arabs and germans who marched through the east german capital to 
protest what they say is a surge in racism spawned by the push to 
unification 
east germany is home to 800000 socalled guest workers 
most of them vietnamese mozambicans or cubans sent by their 
countries years ago 
many were sent as part of agreements made between their 
governments and the former stalinist regime that was toppled in 
october some were promised skilled jobs but now work as laborers 
german newspapers have reported that as east german enterprises 
begin to feel the effects of the free market they have begun 
laying off foreigners before germans 
some foreigners say that although they always have been stared 
at or withstood racial comments the hostility has heightened since 
east germans embraced unification with west germany 
we feel german unity has led to an upsurge in racism said 
ginga eichler an east berlin activist and rally organizer it 
has become a purely german process with no thought given to the 
other people who live here 
she said east germans fearing widespread unemployment have 
vented their frustrations on darkskinned foreigners a hefty loss 
of jobs is expected in east germany as governmentcreated jobs and 
obsolete factories are phased out by a free market 
a group of skinheads shouting neonazi slogans and racial and 
antihomosexual epithets rampaged friday night through the citys 
main square alexander place at least 10 people were injured in 
beatings 
on tuesday the crowd gathered on the square and marched a few 
blocks to the stately redbrick city council building of old 
berlin 
speakers from political parties and activist organizations 
demanded more protection for foreigners living in east germany 
hundreds of foreigners listened although the largest group in the 
crowd was made up of germans 
many foreigners are afraid to take part in demonstrations 
ms eichler said they played very little role in the 
revolution 
germany was divided into communist east and capitalist west 
following the 1945 defeat of adolf hitlers nazi regime in world 
war ii the hardline communist regime of erich honecker in east 
germany was forced out last october by mass demonstrations and the 
rush toward unification began 
east germans were pleased when west germany said on monday it 
would trade most of the worthless east german marks at a 11 rate 
for west german marks as the first step of the unification process 
although detailed discussions still have to be held foreigners 
fear that they may not be given the same favorable trade on their 
east german marks 
i work hard as hard as anybody but i will face economic 
hardship said pham son 32 a computer engineer sent by the 
communist government in vietnam to east germany in 1982 
he said he has been the target of racial comments from east 
german youths unemployment now is here so there is social 
conflict 
ingeburg kleine a nurse in a hospital ward for foreigners said 
many are afraid to speak out 
many speak no german she said as she marched with the 
crowd the educated ones have it not so bad but the workers live 
together and must live in small flats 
she said clerks in stores sometimes will refuse to sell 
particularly scarce items to foreigners occasionally removing the 
items from their baskets when they try to pay 
justino chana 29 was sent to east germany from mozambique in 
1981 and has worked in a slaughterhouse since then 
it is very difficult to live here sometimes he said

most of the 48 young women who tried out for 
the canadian forces infantry last year simply ran out of gas 
and were unable to make it through the grueling training the 
general in charge of the program said tuesday 
its not strength its a question of stamina and endurance 
brig gen dan munro told a pentagonsponsored conference on 
womens issues 
only one women graduated from the infantry school while two 
others are still in training he said 
most of those young women simply ran out of gas munro said 
describing the effect of the 10week basic course topped by 16 
weeks of infantry training that ends with a 10day drill offering 
recruits little sleep amid constant maneuvers 
but canadas military which was ordered last year to open all 
units to women has had far more success integrating women into 
combatrelated jobs in the navy air force and other army units 
such as artillery or the signal corps munro said 
in 1987 the general said canadas defense minister announced 
plans to evaluate combat units in which women would serve with men 
last year however canadas human rights tribunal acting on 
several complaints of discrimination ordered that the tests be 
stopped and that women be integrated into all areas of the nations 
forces except submarines 
munro is the director of canadas office for the combat related 
employment of women he spoke to the annual meeting of the defense 
advisory committee on women in the services which advises the 
defense department on issues relating to women and the military 
the panel is holding its annual conference the week after the 
army announced it had rejected the groups proposal that the 
service undertake a fouryear study of placing women in all 
combatrelated fields 
the recommendation is similar to legislation submitted by rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo 
by us law women are barred from serving on combat ships and 
planes in the navy the air force and the marines but it is army 
policy that bars women from serving in the combatrelated fields 
such as infantry armor and some artillery units 
munro told the panel that canadas female sailors serving on 
board destroyers are happy and their commanding officers report 
satisfaction in their performance the navy is moving toward a 
complete integration of women into the fleet in a positive way and 
at a pace faster than ever had been foreseen 
the air force had moved more swiftly to open more slots to 
women and in the last three years the number of female pilots has 
doubled now two women are flying fighter jets he said 
the general said that even though no one knows what will happen 
in combat we train for war all the time and we in canada have 
no intention of withdrawing women from combat units simply on the 
basis of their sex 
mistakes were made in the recruiting process when women who 
didnt understand the rigors of infantry life were recruited as 
well as women who didnt have the proper physical training he said 
there are 86000 members of the canadian armed forces and about 
10 percent are women the general said

the national commission on aids on tuesday 
called on president bush to coordinate the federal governments 
response to the epidemic and remove restrictions on use of federal 
aids education and prevention funds 
the commission also urged support for federal housing aid and 
support for legislation that would bar discrimination against 
people with aids and would pump money into areas hard hit by the 
epidemic 
all across the country there is a cry for leadership from the 
federal government and partnership between different levels of 
government the commission said in its second report to the 
president 
the commission which also delivered its report to leaders of 
congress has had nine days of hearings in washington and los 
angeles and four working sessions in boston and st paul minn 
since it began its work last august 
panel members also spent time in new york city newark and 
jersey city nj and in rural georgia visiting drug treatment 
centers homeless shelters and other places where people with aids 
can be found including subway tunnels in new york city 
nowhere was it more evident that the care of human life must 
be a priority for our government than in the streets of new york 
city where an estimated 10000 homeless people may have aids or 
aidsrelated diseases the fivepage report said 
but the commission found desperate need for care in california 
as well in some areas of that state there are six to 
eightweek waits for outpatient services the report said 
across the country the commission also heard tales of health 
care denied unless it required acute hospitalization the panel 
said 
commissioners also found that restrictions on the use of federal 
education and prevention funds were prolonging the aids epidemic 
restrictive language in regulations governing use of the funds 
was preventing states and communities from putting out effective 
messages about such things as use of condoms as a safety precaution 
and bleach to clean needles commissioners said 
dr june osborn commission chairwoman said the federal 
government needs some sort of flexible and responsive mechanism 
to coordinate the actions of the different federal departments and 
agencies that provide services for people with aids 
the president can be most helpful in creating such a 
coordinating body to provide focus at the top osborn said 
the commission urged house support for a senatepassed bill 
titled americans with disabilities act which would protect people 
with aids from discrimination and the panel called on states and 
local governments to pass antidiscrimination laws the 
administration also supports the legislation 
panel members also urged passage of a measure that would provide 
600 million to areas that have been hardest hit by the aids 
epidemic and said more federal funds are needed to provide housing 
for people with the disease 
the commissioners praised bush for his march 29 speech in which 
he said compassion not discrimination was needed in the fight 
against aids the panel called it important and historic 
now the presidents commitment needs translation into 
action the commission said 
the 15member commission includes five people appointed by the 
house five appointed by the senate and two by the president the 
secretaries of health and human services defense and veterans 
affairs are nonvoting members

two salvadoran human rights workers were 
honored on capitol hill tuesday for their efforts in promoting 
peace in their wartorn country 
the people especially the peasants have suffered senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said at a ceremony at 
which bishop medardo gomez and maria julia hernandez received the 
oscar romero award 
sen mark hatfield rore said the two were willing to 
sacrifice in order to preserve the dignity of the individual 
the senators made their comments amid growing congressional 
efforts to use us financial aid as a way of ending the war 
between the usbacked salvadoran government and leftist rebels 
some 70000 people have been killed over the last decade 
mitchell said the negotiations now underway between the two 
parties offer hope that the war may end soon 
we must persuade ourselves that a military solution is not the 
path to protecting peace and establishing democracy said ms 
hernandez 
hernandez is director of tutela legal the catholic archbishops 
legal aid office the group conducts investigations of human rights 
in el salvador 
gomez of the lutheran salvadoran synod has been a staunch 
advocate of peace in his country in 1983 he was captured and 
tortured but later released he said he planned to use the award 
to create a foundation to keep alive the christian faith 
gomez and hernandez are recipients of the 10000 oscar romero 
award sponsored by the rothko chapel in houston founded by john 
and dominique de menil 
mrs de menil a frenchborn heiress to the schlumberger 
conglomerate that developed oil drilling named the romero awards 
after a roman catholic archbishop who was murdered in san salvador 
a decade ago 
on capitol hill meanwhile there have been proposals to tie 
future us military aid to improvements in the governments human 
rights record sen christopher dodd dconn has proposed for 
instance withholding an anticipated 90 million in military aid 
this fiscal 1990 and using the escrow funds as leverage to 
encourage negotiations 
some lawmakers are awaiting a report into the slaying of six 
jesuit priests last november a congressional task force has 
investigated the deaths and is expected to release its findings

deals with japan and other foreign partners to 
absorb cost overruns of the 8 billion superconducting super 
collider could kill the project the chairman of the senate energy 
committee warned on tuesday 
the way to get this thing in political trouble is to give away 
the cream of the technology sen j bennett johnston dla 
said of the highenergy physics particle accelerator that president 
bush wants to build near dallas 
johnston made the remarks as house leaders postponed until next 
week action on a bill that would cap federal spending on what would 
be the worlds largest and most powerful accelerator at 5 billion 
and require foreign partners texas or private money to cover any 
cost above that level 
the bill by rep robert roe dnj chairman of the house 
science committee is a response to opponents in congress who claim 
the 1 billion a year the government anticipates spending on the 
collider when construction gets into full swing will squeeze out 
other worthy science endeavors 
the project essentially involves building two circular 
underground tunnels 54 miles around to accelerate beams of protons 
in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light and then make 
them collide 
through the collisions scientists hope to find previously 
unobservable subatomic particles that could provide clues on how 
the cosmos was created 
rep joe barton rtexas in whose district the project would be 
located said that roes bill over opposition from the bush 
administration would limit foreign participation in any aspect of 
the project to 50 percent 
johnston quoted senior officials in the energy department as 
telling him that because of the limit the administration is 
looking at contracting with japan to supply the 10000 supermagnets 
for the project 
i would hate for us to give away the most valuable thing in 
the project the supermagnets and let somebody else develop the 
manufacturing technology he said thats what we did with the 
auto industry 
meanwhile northern lawmakers opposed to the project said they 
would offer amendments when roes bill comes before the house floor 
to increase the foreign funding share from 20 percent to 25 percent 
and require annual reviews by congressional auditors of spending 
and changes in cost estimates 
rep dennis eckart dohio said the audits would provide an 
objective independent assessment to back up our claims that 
the project will be plagued by continuing cost overruns and should 
be scuttled 
this is an incremental process eckart said as a trial 
lawyer i know i have to have an arsenal of evidence to refute the 
claims of opponents clearly last year they had more evidence than 
we had 
the administration said tuesday it would support changes in the 
bill to require the successful testing of 10 prototype magnets 
before allowing construction of the tunnels to begin 
in a statement of policy the white house budget office also 
said it wants deleted from the bill a provision that would refund 
to texas if the project is canceled in the future the 1 
billion it has pledged toward its costs 
sen wendell ford dky who as chairman of the senate energy 
panels subcommittee on research has backed the project warned its 
supporters against trying to defuse opposition by spreading 
contracts for its components around the nation 
if this becomes just another big public works project you 
could be on dangerous ground he said funding then becomes a 
question of how much does your state get and how much does my state 
get

a member of the gang that carried out 
britains great train robbery of 1963 was shot to death by a young 
assailant who fled on a bicycle police in this seaside resort said 
tuesday 
investigators believe the slaying of charles wilson 58 may 
have been drugrelated said a marbella police spokesman who asked 
not to be identified 
a young man in a track suit opened fire monday afternoon on 
wilson after calling at the door of the britons apartment in this 
costa del sol resort the spokesman said 
neighbors told police they spotted the suspect fleeing on a 
yellow bicycle shortly after hearing gunshots coming from wilsons 
apartment the spokesman said 
wilson was pronounced dead on arrival at the marbella clinic 
another police spokesman in the resort favored by european 
vacationers said the motive for the shooting was not immediately 
clear but that investigators believed it may have been related to 
drug trafficking 
wilson and 14 other members of a gang took part in what has been 
called the great train robbery on aug 8 1963 when they held 
up the glasgow to london mail train near aylesbury 40 miles 
northwest of london 
they stole 26 million pounds then worth 72 million at the 
time it was the biggest robbery in britain 
police recovered less than 966000 but wilson and most of the 
other gang members were captured and jailed wilson was sentenced 
to 30 years in prison in 1964 and released in 1978 
costa del sol on spains mediterranean coast has been a haven 
for suspected british criminals but in recent months the spanish 
government has sent a number of suspects back to britain 
wilson had lived in marbella for several years he was suspected 
of links to gangs that every year smuggle thousands of pounds of 
hashish from north africa through spain to northern europe police

the watchdogs charged with policing federal 
programs for fraud and abuse often farm out work to private shops 
leaving government oversight of a wide array of contractors in the 
hands of fellow contractors 
the governments inspectors general in reports to congress and 
in public statements attribute the hiring of private auditors and 
other contractors to severe staff shortages and they say most of 
the outside work is satisfactory 
but critics inside and outside the government say having private 
firms monitor private firms creates a weak link in government 
oversight of millions if not billions of dollars in contracts 
for programs ranging from running nuclear plants to job training to 
medicare 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act and from 
congressional investigators and other sources and information from 
recent interviews show that a handful of accounting firms led or 
heavily staffed by former government auditors get the bulk of the 
bigmoney contracts from the inspectors general 
a review by the labor departments inspector general said that 
in most cases it would be cheaper to hire a government worker 
most of the governments inspectors general use private firms 
working under contract to some degree and a handful have even used 
them to target other contractors for audits or possible prosecution 
in at least two cases both at the department of energy a 
private firm has been asked to review procurement to determine 
whether contracts the department awarded were wasteful or paid 
contractors too much 
for the most part the work is good but the standards are not 
always being met said a top aide to one inspector general 
its clear that having some of these audits was worse than having 
no audit at all it creates an impression of integrity that may not 
be there said the aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
inspectors general were added governmentwide in the 1980s in 
part because of congressional efforts to improve oversight as the 
reagan administration pushed to cut government payrolls and have 
more work performed by private contractors 
however inspectors general also faced staffing limitations 
leading them to turn to private firms to help police the growing 
number of private firms involved in government work 
one firm that does audits for several inspectors general also 
has provided three of five lecturers for a course in which 
contractors are taught to rebut government audits the firm 
leonard g birnbaum amp co recently ended its relationship with the 
seminar after congressional investigators brought it to the 
attention of the energy department 
several companies that receive energy department funding have 
sent employees to past seminars but a department official said he 
did not believe birnbaums role posed a possible conflict 
i dont see it has any relationship with anything they do for 
us said gordon harvey energys assistant inspector general for 
audits they must be able to certify under the rules that there 
are no conflicts 
a recent review by a department panel however supported 
findings of a senate subcommittee that several contractors who 
certified they had no potential conflicts had also submitted 
documents listing work for firms that could pose conflicts 
in a letter to subcommittee chairman sen david pryor dark 
the department said the review panel perceives a significant 
danger of a contractor being called upon to analyze its own or a 
former clients work product 
and energy is the only department to require written disclosure 
other agencies rely on a contractors word 
often inspectors general use specialized outside help for 
detailed chores the ig at the department of housing and urban 
development for example uses private appraisers to assess the 
value of properties involved in larger contract audits and the 
postal services inspector general has hired hypnotists to help 
witnesses recall events 
but several agencies whose inspectors general rely heavily on 
contractors have them perform not only routine audits but also 
policy and strategy development raising the issue of whether the 
contracted work is inherently governmental general accounting 
office and office of management and budget guidelines frown on 
using contractors for work meeting that standard but the 
definition is interpreted differently within the government 
the labor department inspector general has agreements with 27 
contractors and has awarded more than 18 million in contracts in 
the past two years according to records provided to a 
congressional subcommittee 
among the tasks labors ig has assigned contractors were 
compiling a target list of contractors for audits and recommending 
cases for prosecution under wage and hour laws 
the energy department ig has contracts with a halfdozen private 
firms and has spent 17 million on such contracts since january 
1988 according to department figures 
other agencies whose inspectors general have contracted out more 
than 2 million and as much as 8 million in work in the past two 
years include the departments of agriculture education and health 
and human services the agency for international development and 
the environmental protection agency 
some examples of work inspectors general have authorized private 
companies to perform 
energy this year asked a contractor to review contracts to 
determine if the department was paying contractors too much 
labor hired a private firm to determine if an employee 
compensation program was being administered as congress intended 
labors ig also paid a contractor to oversee two other contractors 
providing related work 
the justice department ig hired a contractor for tasks 
including legislative research preparation of proposed policies 
and procedures and developing suggested audit procedures 
the energy departments harvey in comments echoed by 
representatives of other inspectors general said the government 
auditors review the contractors reports and that firms staffed 
with former government auditors offer vital experience to 
shortstaffed ig offices 
we do not have enough inhouse resources to meet the audit 
needs he said

the nations newspaper publishers on tuesday 
watched videotaped interviews with americans who say they dont 
read newspapers very much then debated how to change that 
an advertising consultant advised the publishers to adopt a more 
local focus suggesting that international issues such as the push 
for independence in lithuania dont sell advertising 
a publisher countered that newspapers still reach a larger 
audience than any other news medium 
the comments were made during a panel discussion at the american 
newspaper publishers association 104th annual convention the 
discussion moderated by jeff greenfield of abc news was called 
ozzie and harriet are gone who do you think youre writing 
for 
virginia dodge fielder vice president of research for 
knightridder inc expressed industry frustration in trying to 
pinpoint the cause of declining readership 
i wish people hated us more she said i wish they 
expressed more dissatisfaction because if they did wed know how to 
tackle it what the public is saying is not i hate you but i 
dont need you youre a great electric company but i live in an 
allgas house 
the session opened with videotaped interviews in which subjects 
were asked if they read a newspaper 
i dont have time was a common response several said that 
tv news was easier one man said he felt less connected to his 
local newspaper since big business had taken it over the comment 
echoed a message emphasized by laurel cutler vice chairman of 
fcbleber katz partners and vice president of consumer affairs for 
the chrysler corp 
the only specialized thing about a newspaper is its 
locality she told the audience localness is what you have to 
sell thats why usa today is a very peculiar animal i guess its 
the local newspaper for people on airlines 
frank a daniels jr president and publisher of the news amp 
observer of raleigh nc interjected that a newspaper 
traditionally has been a smorgasbord you have something in there 
for everybody 
but ms cutler warned against newspapers trying to be all 
things to all people and suggested specialization was more 
appealing to advertisers 
the more generalized the more all things to all people the 
less we care about you she said 
daniels suggested that newspapers might have to follow the lead 
of american express which created different categories of cards 
for different income brackets he noted that a newspaper 
subscription is costly and perhaps different price brackets for 
different incomes would encourage more readership 
how do we create a platinum card newspaper he asked 
greenfield suggested that the puzzle of declining readership may 
not be complex 
is it possible that the reason people read newspapers so 
devotedly in 1940 is there was nothing else to inform them he 
asked and maybe this age of newspapers is like the buggy whip 
manufacturers in 1910 
publishers and editors on the panel disagreed 
one thing you may be overlooking is how adaptable newspapers 
are said c shelby coffey iii editor and executive vice 
president of the los angeles times 
he noted that the times has numerous regional bureaus to keep 
the paper local but has inaugurated a new world report section 
to emphasize global developments 
research at the times shows that international news is of 
great interest to readers he said 
coffey and gerald garcia editor and publisher of the knoxville 
tenn journal also urged development of a multiethnic reporting 
force to keep up with interests of a diverse reading audience 
coffey called it the polycultural newsroom 
consultant ronald brown president of banks brown inc of san 
francisco noted that the interests of that citys chineseamericn 
population are underrepresented in its newspapers 
all panelists agreed that improved education would improve 
readership of newspapers

an enzyme in the human body normally breaks down milk sugar 
lactose in dairy products but blacks asians and american 
indians tend to have a low level of this enzyme said george 
somkuti of the departments agricultural research service 
one solution is to add something to dairy products that does the 
work of the human bodys natural enzyme 
somkuti said researchers have developed a new source of the 
enzyme that is better than those now being used as additives 
because of its foodgrade nature 
the new source is an altered form of an organism streptococcus 
thermophilus which produces an enzyme that breaks down lactose in 
dairy products he said the food and drug administration has 
approved s thermophilus as a natural agent for making products 
such as cheese and yogurt 
somkuti said the altered bacteriums benefit is that it wont 
grow when added to milk however it splits lactose into two simple 
sugars glucose and galactose he said 
the new technique which is being patented by the usda agency 
could help people with lactose intolerance enjoy dairy products and 
thereby boost sales by milk producers officials said 
somkuti works at the usda agencys eastern regional research 
center in philadelphia pa the announcement was issued in 
washington by the agency

the environmental protection agency is 
considering whether to impose a mandatory recycling requirement for 
major users of chloroflourocarbons or cfcs the agency said 
tuesday 
the chemical which is widely used as a refrigerant and as an 
industrial solvent is a principal cause of stratospheric ozone 
depletion and will be phased out over the coming decade in many 
countries including the united states 
but the epa said it was considering regulatory action aimed at 
getting users to recycle the chemical instead of letting it 
routinely into the air during maintenance and installation 
such releases have been common when mechanics work on automobile 
air conditioners or during repairs or installation of commercial or 
home air conditioners 
the epa said among the proposals that it was considering for 
possible rulemaking is a mandatory cfc recycling program that would 
be imposed on major users of the chemical nationwide another 
option would be a depositrefund system where users of cfcs would 
return cannisters of the chemical for a refund instead of venting 
the chemical the agency said 
many cfc users already have announced plans to shift to cfc 
recycling programs several of the major automakers for example 
have said within the next year they plan to provide dealers with 
equipment that would recycle cfcs used in automobile air 
conditioners 
the commercial air conditioning industry also has said it is 
developing recycling programs for the chemical

revolution visited the new york philharmonic on tuesday for the 
first time since being named music director of the 
conductorkilling ensemble 
his fiveyear contract was announced two weeks ago it starts in 
the fall of 1992 
i dont hear the word hero very much the 62yearold 
music director of the gewandhaus orchestra of leipzig told 
reporters i did my deal only to avoid confrontation that brings 
blood to our streets in leipzig we were lucky that everybody felt 
it shouldnt be a confrontation and it didnt happen 
masur held meetings between east german police and people 
pressing for change after those meetings talks were held and 
bloodshed avoided some said that only masurs international 
standing as conductor of the gewandhaus made the meetings possible 
masur said he would remain involved in the politics of leipzig 
but his main concern masur said is the gewandhaus orchestra 
which he will lead through the 199394 season east germany 
smaller than massachusetts has 91 professional orchestras all 
statesupported before the revolution 
the opening of the wall brings lots of very positive points 
he said at the moment everybody is a little bit frightened i 
dont think it will be very easy to keep it all going i believe 
that money from the government will be given but it will not be 
enough 
he said that when he first conducted the new york philharmonic 
in 1981 hed heard its reputation as a conductor killer 
after a while i discovered they are wonderful human beings 
he said 
as for changes he intends at the philharmonic masur mentioned 
closer cooperation with the juilliard school which is next door in 
lincoln center he also wants to start a childrens choir organize 
longer rehearsals for difficult works and shorter for familiar ones 
im not one of those who is promising everything before the 
election and then not doing it later masur said i only can 
promise you one thing i will do this as honest as i did everything 
in my life 
asked how he feels about the philharmonic engaging him instead 
of an american masur said that he has helped many young american 
conductors who were attempting to establish reputations in europe 
this question comes to my heart my successor should be american

jewish settlers tuesday accused the state 
department of interfering in their efforts to retain control of a 
housing complex in the christian quarter of jerusalems old city 
were disappointed with the interference of the state 
department in something which is both an internal israeli matter 
and is also under judicial discussion said rabbi jonathan blass 
a spokesman for the neot david settlement 
his statement came a day after state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler called the settlers move into the christian area 
an insensitive and provocative action 
she also said the israeli governments funding of the settlement 
is deeply disturbing 
the israeli housing ministry acknowledged last weekend that it 
put up 18 million toward the purchase of neot davids lease 
the movement of the 150 jews into the complex near the venerated 
church of the holy sepulcher on april 11 set off demonstrations by 
christian clerics and palestinians 
the fourbuilding complex is owned by the greek orthodox church 
which took the settlers to court and won an eviction order the 
settlers have appealed and a hearing is scheduled thursday before 
the supreme court 
the us complaint about neot david was relayed to israeli prime 
minister yitzhak shamir by us ambassador william brown in a 
meeting monday 
the united states opposes the establishment of settlements on 
israelioccupied land saying it is an obstacle to peace 
shamir later said the government gave the settlers funding as 
part of a general government housing program 
the case at hand is one of an ordinary commercial real estate 
transaction shamir said in a statement 
the government he said does not assist and would even have 
prevented any action constituting an affront to places sacred to 
any of the religions or holy sites 
but he also added that every jew has the right to live in 
jerusalem 
israel captured the old city from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war and annexed it israel captured the west bank and gaza strip in 
the same war and continues to occupy the territories home to 17 
million palestinians more than 140 jewish settlements have been 
built in the occupied lands 
in the west bank on tuesday a jewish settlement leader suffered 
a head cut when he was stoned by palestinians youths 
the victim rabbi moshe levinger said stones were thrown at him 
near the beit romano settler enclave in the heart of hebron he 
said he put his hand on his gun and the stonethrowers fled 
i did not fire because i didnt see exactly who threw the 
stones levinger said 
levinger currently is on trial for manslaughter for allegedly 
shooting to death an arab shoe salesman after he was stoned in 
hebron on sept 30 1988 
also tuesday eight masked palestinians armed with axes and 
knives stabbed a gaza strip taxi driver to death arab reports 
said they said the victim was suspected of collaborating with 
israel 
he was identified as nabil mohammed aloush 35 of the jabaliya 
refugee camp 
his death raised to 209 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the 28monthold uprising against israeli rule 
most were suspected of collaborating with israel 
in addition 676 palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians and 43 israelis have died in the violence

cuba began jamming the us governments radio 
marti broadcasts between 6 am and noon on tuesday said a 
spokeswoman for the voice of america which runs the service 
voa spokeswoman beth knisley said the agency deplores the action 
taken against radio marti which began broadcasting five years ago 
the jamming denies the cuban people access to uncensored news and 
information she said 
she quoted a cuban government statement as saying that the 
jamming was a new step toward a definitive solution of the 
problem she said the broadcast operation can still be heard on 
shortwave radios 
until this month cuba had not interfered with radio marti 
except for a humming sound that impaired the quality of the 
broadcasts 
cuba started jamming the station during the predawn hours last 
week and then shifted the interference on tuesday to the 
postsunrise period when the audience is much greater 
the actions appear to be related to the advent of tv marti the 
televised version of radio marti tv marti tests began last month 
during the early morning hours and have been jammed consistently by 
cuban transmitters 
there have been some reports however that tv marti has been 
seen in most of the islands 14 provinces 
at a news conference three weeks ago president fidel castro 
suggested that the tv marti tests could provoke a crackdown on 
radio marti 
castro said it is unacceptable for the united states to transmit 
radio programming unilaterally to cuba one possible solution he 
said is for the two countries to reach an agreement governing 
mutual broadcast rights 
the united states has defended both radio and tv marti on 
grounds that the cuban people have not had access to objective news 
since castro assumed power 31 years ago 
castro has called tv marti a gross instrument of subversion 
that violates national sovereignty and international law the bush 
administration has said the station is consistent with 
international law

eleven lawmakers asked the pentagon on tuesday 
to reinstate craig fields as head of the defense departments 
hightechnology research and development agency 
firing and silencing such a key player in the us 
competitiveness debate is at best shortsighted at worst a major 
breach of our future economic security the bipartisan group said 
in a letter to deputy defense secretary donald atwood 
fields had been head of the defense advanced research projects 
agency for a year until he was transferred friday the agency 
darpa provides money to private industry to develop 
hightechnology goods with military uses 
supporters of fields contend he was removed because he advocated 
spending money on socalled dualuse technologies technology 
that has civilian as well as military applications 
the agency has a 12 billion budget about half of which goes 
to dualuse technologies said rep mel levine dcalif at a news 
conference to announce the drive to reinstate fields 
darpafunded projects include super computers artificial 
intelligence software semiconductor manufacturing technology and 
biotechnology levine whose home state is a hightechnology 
center is cochairman of the congressional hightechnology caucus 
levine is also chairman of rebuild america a publicpolicy 
group that promotes hightechnology industries levine said he is 
drafting legislation that would put darpa under control of the 
commerce department and require that funds be spent only on 
dualuse technology except in special cases 
although darpa is in the pentagon it is one of the few 
government programs developing civilian technologies 
the administration is divided over the role of government in 
helping private industry conservatives arge that such funding 
would interfere with the free market place and that private 
industry should fund such research 
among those disagreeing with that conservative stance are sen 
john heinz rpa who signed the letter 
other countries are engaged in national economic strategies to 
advance their own commercial interests through government 
cooperation and financial support on the technological level 
said heinz darpa is the only strategy that we have in the entire 
federal government 
why am i here as a republican because i do not want george 
bush to go down in history as the president who presided over the 
economic decline of the united states of america because he and 
members of his administration were blind 
another republican who signed the letter and helping lead the 
drive to reinstate fields is rep don ritter of pennsylvania who 
is chairman of the congressional technology and policy task force 
as well as ranking member of the commerce and competitiveness 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
other signers are house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
reps les aucoin dore norman mineta dcalif edward markey 
dmass nicholas mavroules dmass marcy kaptur dohio and 
helen d bentley rmd and sen albert gore jr dtenn 
chairman of the senate commerce subcommittee on science technology 
and space 
at the pentagon a statement was released saying that victor 
reis the deputy director of darpa has been named acting director 
pending the appointment of a new director 
the statement also said that fields would begin serving in his 
new post on may 6 in which he is responsible for evaluating and 
recommending actions to streamline the large and complex research 
and development laboratory infrastructure of the defense 
department

the coming of high definition television wont 
reduce demand for american movies and television programs overseas 
a report to congress said tuesday 
the general accounting office said however that a single 
standard for overtheair transmission was necesssary to make us 
broadcasters and television manufacturers competitive with japanese 
and european satellite transmission of the new technology 
high definition television or hdtv offers a wider and sharper 
television picture than traditional television by increasing the 
number of horizontal lines that make up the picture 
television systems worldwide use different production formats 
and transmission standards because efforts to agree on a standard 
have been unsuccessful similarly there has been no agreement on 
standards for high definition television 
international broadcasters met last year but declined to adopt 
the standard developed by the japanese the socalled 112560 
standard 1125 lines per picture renewed 60 times per second 
current us television pictures use 525 lines per picture renewed 
30 times per second 
the absence of such a standard will not negatively affect the 
us entertainment industrys ability to successfully market its 
movies and television programs said the gao the congressional 
investigative arm 
the gao said representatives of the us entertainment industry 
were confident there would be no impact on international marketing 
because they sell their programs primarily on content rather than 
picture quality 
the us industry the largest producer worldwide of theater and 
television programs is likely to continue to produce movies and 
television programs using 35mm film the report said 
according to motion picture and television industry officials 
film is the highest quality production format currently available 
with about 2000 lines of resolution as a result it converts well 
to all current television standards and according to motion 
picture industry officials will also convert well to hdtv 
standards the report said 
however an overtheair transmission standard is needed to 
allow us broadcasters and television manunfacturers the 
opportunity to participate in hdtv gao found 
the lack of a transmission standard could be a competitive 
disadvantage with cable and satellite companies for american 
broadcasters who are constrained by regulatory and technical 
limitations of overtheair transmission the report said 
us exports of movie and television programs now contribute 
about 1 billion a year to the nations balance of payments

the kremlin reinforced kgb border guards in 
lithuania on tuesday and lithuanias president accused the united 
states of selling out his rebellious baltic republic in its 
confrontation with the soviet government 
the soviet news agency tass reported a gunfire attack monday 
night on a soviet army barracks in vilnius lithuanias capital 
but said no one was hurt 
president bush said in washington he will not impose sanctions 
on the soviet union at this time over its crackdown on lithuania 
he said he feared sanctions might prompt moscow to take action 
that would set back the whole case of freedom around the world 
the soviets have cut off oil drastically curtailed natural gas 
and curbed other supplies to lithuania in trying to force the 
republic to halt its sixweekold drive for independence 
earlier soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev 
warned that us sanctions could have negative consequences 
perfiliev did not state directly that the soviet union might 
retaliate but said any actions taken which could pull apart the 
sides of the argument of course could have negative consequences 
not only for the soviet union but for the international situation 
after bushs announcement president vytautas landsbergis of 
lithuania issued an angry statement from vilnius 
can the freedom of one group of people be sold for the freedom 
of another what then is the idea of freedom itself he said 
this is another munich 
he was referring to the 1938 munich pact in which france and 
britain allowed nazi germany to take control of czechoslovakia the 
treaty was widely viewed as caving in to adolf hitler the pact 
became a symbol of appeasement 
tass and soviet tvs nightly newscast reported bushs 
announcement 
tass also quoted soviet army maj alexei kirichenko as saying a 
shot was fired at an open window at about 10 pm when soldiers 
were already inside the barracks it said the bullet smashed a 
window on the opposite wall and that ballistics experts believe a 
combat weapon and not a hunting rifle was used 
the agency also reported from vilnius that the lithuanian 
parliament on tuesday set up a commission to prepare 
antiblockade measures and named prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene as commission chief 
president mikhail s gorbachevs advisers refused on tuesday to 
receive a fivemember lithuanian delegation sent to moscow to 
discuss the plight of the republic after a week of enduring the 
kremlin economic blockade 
lithuania hopes to make up for some of the supplies moscow has 
cut with imports from abroad but the kgbs announcement that it 
was adding personnel and equipment to guard the republics border 
appeared designed as a warning against such a step 
lt anatoly parakhin of the kgb whose forces are responsible 
for soviet borders did not specify in a moscow briefing what the 
secret police were looking for but indicated weapons were on the 
list 
control has been established over possible contacts between 
soviet and foreign ships in territorial waters and within the 
borders of the economic zone of the ussr to avert the transfer 
of weapons and ammunition to lithuania tass quoted parakhin as 
saying 
the movement through the border of all cargo and means of 
transportation is being most carefully controlled 
all coastal fishing ships without exception are being 
inspected by border details 
he said the steppedup control was justified by an april 12 
incident in which 240000 rounds of hunting ammunition were found 
aboard the soviet ship marat kozlov tass said it was sailing to 
lithuania from west germany 
the increased border patrols were in line with a march 21 
kremlin statement calling for increased security on the lithuanian 
section of the soviet border 
moscow began tightening its economic vise last week after 
lithuania refused to rescind laws bolstering its march 11 
declaration of independence 
mrs prunskiene returned to moscow from scandinavia on monday on 
a trip to seek foreign support especially oil 
v mosolov an official of the state supplies committee in 
moscow told the news agency that railroad tanker cars needed to 
transport imported oil in lithuania belong to the soviet railways 
ministry and not the republic he seemed to imply the republic 
would not be allowed to use ministry facilities

as simple as that said vlok he said police would continue to 
watch and note the activities of political parties as part of their 
duties

president jacques delors of the european 
commission said tuesday he hoped to reach an agreement with the 
united states by the end of july on the longdisputed issue of 
subsidies to farmers 
the commission is the joint executive of the 12 countries in the 
european common market which has taken the position that it is 
unrealistic to talk about ending subsidies 
president bush has adopted the position of the reagan 
administration that subsidies should be phased out by the year 2000 
europe and the united states both spend billions on these 
subsidies every year 
if we leave on the side the war over principle its possible 
in a pragmatic approach to find a solution which reduces on both

commandos of the french secret service twice broke 
into nuclear power plants in 1987 in one case leaving behind two 
fake bombs as proof of lax security a newspaper reported tuesday 
le canard enchaine a satirical weekly known for its 
investigative reporting ran a photocopy of a letter apparently 
written by the state power companys security chief reporting to 
his superior about the second raid 
according to the letter two secret service agents carried out 
an undetected mock sabotage raid in october 1987 on the nuclear 
plant at bugey near lyon they climbed over an electrified fence 
placed two dummy bombs inside a cooling tower then set up a rocket 
launcher outside the letter said 
the other raid was conducted in march 1987 on the nuclear plant 
at nogentsurseine near paris with agents gaining access to the 
control room the newspaper said 
the paper also published a photocopy of a letter apparently 
from an interior ministry official informing officials in charge 
of the nuclear industry that a former member of the red brigades 
the italian terrorist group had been employed as a cleaner at a 
french nuclear plant 
there was no immediate official response to the weeklys report 
last week after le canard enchaine published a less detailed 
article on the same subject electric company official lucien 
bertron said a test raid was conducted at bugey in 198586 and 
described other parts of the report as pure fantasy

a man accused of setting a booby trap that killed 
a burglary suspect in a crimeplagued warehouse is getting plenty 
of sympathy from a public fed up with crime supporters said 
tuesday 
i think we are getting demoralized here and generally losing 
control of our community said tj scranton a onetime 
schoolteacher weve reached a place where the police cant 
handle it 
scranton is one of more than 100 people who have voiced support 
for handyman philip connaghan through letters to newspapers and 
calls to radio talk shows connaghan is accused in the april 14 
death of michael mccomb 19 who was killed by a blast from a 
12gauge shotgun propped inside a warehouse 
connaghan 46 of suburban arvada was released monday on 5000 
bond after he was arrested for investigation of firstdegree 
murder denver district attorney norm early has said he will decide 
by thursday whether to file charges 
connaghan has denied knowledge of the booby trap which is 
illegal under city ordinances 
the warehouse has been burglarized eight times since 1987 each 
time the burglars have targeted connaghans valuable shop tools 
the warehouse also has housed vehicle parts pickup camper shells 
and acetylene torches 
last july connaghan told police he lost more than 7000 in 
tools during a burglary 
the case has triggered overwhelming public support for connaghan 
among residents who are fed up with crime said kris olinger 
news director at koaam radio an alltalk and news station 
they can empathize with what phillip connaghan is going 
through in terms of being burglarized she said 
by a 91 margin callers are saying connaghan should not be 
charged olinger said 
in addition the station has aired comments from an undetermined 
number of callers who said he should be able to protect his 
business and livelihood and especially if he couldnt get any help 
from the police she said 
on sunday letters to the editor in denvers two newspapers were 
primarily in favor of property protection a dozen letters appeared 
in both papers with only one opposing the use of booby traps 
one reader wrote it seems that michael mccomb got a taste of 
oldfashioned american justice 
among those who are opposed to booby traps and threatening 
property protection devices are public safety officials who might 
have to break into buildings to assist in emergencies 
i am confident that the emotions of the community would be 
very different if a fireman or policeman had been killed by a booby 
trap while performing his duties one writer to a newspaper said 
connaghans case hit close to home for scranton 46 a music 
teacher whose denver home was damaged by a fire set by burglars 
scranton has taken his frustration one step further by 
proposing a revision in colorados socalled make my day law to 
include property protection 
the law nicknamed after a line from a clint eastwood movie 
allows homeowners to use deadly force to defend themselves in 
lifethreatening situations 
scranton said he is starting a petition drive to change the law 
to allow homeowners to set up what he calls lifethreatening 
security devices to protect property

the union representing 14000 united airlines 
flight attendants ratified a new contract tuesday that is dependent 
upon success of a 438 billion employee buyout of the airline the 
union announced 
the ratification vote by mail ballot is one of the steps 
required before the employee buyout is completed 
the united takeover announced earlier this month calls for 
71000 employees to give 2 billion in concessions over five years 
flight attendants pilots and machinist union members all are 
involved in the deal which has not yet received financing 
contracts with the air line pilots association and the 
international association of machinists have yet to be ratified 
the employee stock ownership plan is to include allocated shares 
for each flight attendant after one year of service and a union 
representative on the united airlines board of directors the union 
said 
the contract eliminates a program designed to prevent flight 
attendants from being overweight according to the announcement 
throughout the airline industry flight attendants have been 
subject to weight programs tied to appearance not performance 
the union said in a statement 
the flight attendants current contract remains in effect until 
the buyout is completed negotiations for a new contract have been 
going on since september 1987 flight attendants rejected a 
tentative contract in november 1987 
susan bianchisand union president noted that flight 
attendants formerly called skygirls or stewardesses and 
stewards have worked on airplanes since 1930 
sixty years later the united flight attendants can now pride 
themselves on being new aviation pioneers as they take the bold 
steps toward owning their airline said ms bianchisand 
union members flying with united make up about half of the 
unions membership with the remainder working for 17 other 
airlines

six siblings living as refugees for more 
than four years in the italian embassy in albania have refused an 
albanian offer to emigrate saying they do not trust the 
government a diplomat reported tuesday 
the popa family members two brothers and four sisters aged 52 
to 65 walked into the italian embassy in the capital tirana on 
dec 12 1985 and demanded asylum they told diplomats they had 
been confined almost 20 years to kules a village west of tirana 
because a brother had defected to the west 
it was the first known case of albanians seeking shelter in a 
western embassy 
on monday the official albanian news agency said the six were 
free to emigrate after they received albanian passports and visas 
albania is a hardline stalinist state that has been loosening some 
of its controls in recent months 
but the siblings have rejected those terms apparently fearful 
of what could happen after they leave the safety of the embassy to 
apply for the passports and visas 
the problem lies in the formalities requested by the albanian 
government which directly concern the popa brothers said paolo 
de nicolo first secretary of the italian embassy in tirana they 
would have to spend one or two days outside the mission under 
albanian sovereignty 
he said the siblings have also refused to apply for standard 
emigration visas 
this they refuse to do de nicolo said they consider 
themselves political refugees eager to leave the country at once 
de nicolo said italy and albania were continuing to work on an 
acceptable solution to the standoff

a group calling itself islamic jihad 
movementjerusalem said tuesday it would launch attacks against 
americans unless the us senate reverses a motion endorsing a 
united jerusalem as israels capital 
the group made the threat in an arabiclanguage typewritten 
statement delivered to beiruts annahar newspaper 
the american senate should reverse its decision in 10 days or 
else every american inside and outside moslem countries will be a 
target of terrorism and revenge said the statement 
the us senate on a voice vote passed a motion march 22 
endorsing a united jerusalem as the capital of israel 
the motion is nonbinding and is opposed by the bush 
administration which does not recognize jerusalem as israels 
capital 
the communique said the us move has encouraged the zionists 
and made them capture a building belonging to greek orthodox 
palestinians as a step which will be followed by others 
some 150 jews occupied a 72room building complex in the heart 
of the arab christian quarter of old jerusalem earlier this month 
the greek orthodox church has filed a lawsuit against the new 
settlement claiming the four buildings it occupies are owned by 
the church and were illegally sold by a former tenant 
the united states has denounced the settlement as well as the 
use of us aid money to finance it 
no details were available on islamic jihad movementjerusalem 
a group calling itself islamic jihadbeit almaqdis or islamic 
holy warjerusalem claimed responsibility for a bus attack in 
egypt in february that killed nine israelis 
but the leader of islamic jihadbeit almaqdis assad bayoud 
altammimi told the associated press in amman that his group was 
not responsible for the latest threat 
im not aware of it at all and have not heard of such a 
movement he said 
hours after the statement was released in beirut the us house 
of representatives approved a nonbinding resolution identical to 
the senate measure recognizing a united jerusalem as israels 
capital 
the 378to34 vote came despite arguments the move would stir 
resentment among arab states and complicate administration efforts 
to achieve peace 
senate minority leader robert dole rkansas complained after a 
trip to the middle east this month that the senate move damaged 
peace efforts and said he regretted supporting it 
jerusalem is regarded as a holy city by christians moslems and 
jews israel annexed arab east jerusalem after the 1967 
arabisraeli war and declared the united city as its eternal 
capital 
but us policy holds that jerusalems status must be determined 
through negotiations among all parties the us embassy to israel 
is in tel aviv

the us census bureau under heavy criticism for 
missing millions of people when it mailed forms to john and jane q 
public on tuesday was preparing an army of counters to hit the 
streets and find more 
across the country census workers enumerators in census 
lingo were handed cardboard briefcases and told to have their no 
2 pencils ready for the mammoth job they face when they begin 
knocking on doors thursday they began three days of training on 
monday 
dont take anyone with you and dont talk to anyone about 
census results except your crew leader cozella brown cautioned 
her crew of seven at a training session tuesday 
if residents refuse to answer tell them youre coming 
back she said 
persistence might be whats called for given that just 63 
percent of us households had returned census forms mailed to 
their homes as of tuesday said rudolph brewington a spokesman at 
census bureau headquarters in suitland md 
the 1990 response rate compares with 75 percent of us 
households mailing in forms in 1980 and falls short of the census 
bureaus own prediction that 70 percent would drop their census 
forms in the mailbox this year 
at its peak in the next several weeks the census bureau 
estimates 330000 enumerators 5000 in chicago alone will be 
knocking on the doors of the previously uncounted 
critics say that even with the large number of enumerators hired 
for this phase of the census called nonresponse followup 
many americans may still fall through the cracks 
how many enumerators are bilingual they dont take that 
into account said maurice sone midwest census coordinator for 
the mexicanamerican legal defense and education fund 
enthusiasm to participate is there said sone the biggest 
problem weve had is people who didnt get the forms there is 
a real danger of undercount 
brewington said however that a greater percentage of hispanics 
have responded to the census than of any other population group 
this is a great surprise he said hispanics are leading 
and closely behind hispanics are blacks 
the people who are really not responding are suburban white 
households he said 
workers were told at miss browns session that residents wont 
have an easy time avoiding the census should an enumerator fail to 
get a response after three attempts miss brown herself will make 
three tries if she fails her boss then will try three more times 
be friendly yet firm a workbook urges census workers 
even so miss browns field supervisor leobie jackson conceded 
some people will remain uncounted 
there are 100 reasons why people might not want to send their 
forms in jackson said i can see very easily that there could 
be an undercount we try to enumerate every person thats all we 
can do

floridas agriculture commissioner announced 
tuesday the state will begin aerial pesticide spraying to combat an 
infestation of mediterranean fruit flies 
a malathion compound will be sprayed by helicopter beginning 
thursday in a mostly residential 16squaremile area commissioner 
doyle conner said at a news conference 
the spraying will continue for four weeks followed by the 
release of millions of sterile medflies over a 75day period to 
break the breeding cycle fruit quarantine boundaries have not yet 
been established 
six of the cropdestroying pests have been discovered near miami 
international airport including two on tuesday 
conner said the eradication program has proven successful and is 
the best approach despite environmental concerns raised over 
similar sprayings in california 
consumer activists and local governments in southern california 
have protested the repeated spraying of malathionlaced syrup on 
suburban neighborhoods the medfly has spread from suburban back 
yards to orange and grapefruit groves in some of the regions 
richest farmland 
those who advocate deviating from accepted scientific 
procedures you run into the grave risk of getting into the 
predicament california is in conner said we dont want to 
stay in this program a day longer than necessary 
bobby mckown executive vice president of florida citrus mutual 
in lakeland said monday the 12000member growers organization 
supports immediate action to control and eradicate the medflies 
so they dont expand beyond residential areas 
medflies considered one of the worlds most serious 
agricultural pests are about half the size of houseflies they do 
not sting and pose no threat to humans but the larvae hatching 
inside more than 250 varieties of fruits and vegetables can turn it 
to inedible mush 
conner said the 24 ounces of malathion to be sprayed per acre 
with a syrupy insect food bait posed no health risk but an 
environmentalist blasted the announcement 
the bad thing about using these kinds of chemicals is that 
they wipe out all the insects in an area the good and the bad 
said lee emerson vice president of the environment group friends 
of the oleta river 
its not the kind of balanced environmentally sensitive 
approach we should be taking these days he said 
the zone to be sprayed covers suburban miami springs virginia 
gardens part of hialeah and unincorporated areas northwest of 
downtown miami the latest fly was found tuesday in virginia 
gardens 
the florida medfly advisory group which includes medfly experts 
from the us department of agriculture expanded the area of 
intensive trapping monday from 81 to 106 square miles and beefed up 
the inspection staff 
traps were set in fruit trees by state agricultural inspectors 
around dade county following the discovery april 16 of a lone male 
medfly near the airport two more males were found last weekend in 
sourorange trees in miami springs and hialeah and one female in a 
calamondin tree in miami springs 
some 60000 gallons of malathion in a stronger concentration 
about 31 ounces per acre are used annually throughout florida for 
mosquito control 
the last medfly infestation in south florida was in 1987 when 
five males were found in hialeah the last major outbreak to affect 
floridas commercial groves spread across 28 counties in 1956

franjo tudjman said tuesday he was 
confident his centerright croatian democratic union party would 
emerge with a majority from croatias first free elections in 50 
years 
preliminary results of sundays elections showed the party 
leading in races for 111 of the 196 seats in two chambers of the 
threehouse parliament 
i am confident that the cdu will win more than 60 percent of 
parliamentary seats after the second round of the vote to be 
held in two weeks tudjman told journalists at a news conference 
with about 70 percent counted of the nearly 28 million votes 
cast the governing reform communist party renamed the party for 
democratic reform led in races for 50 seats and the centrist 
coalition for national accord 14 
in about 20 of the 111 constituencies in which the cdu led 
however a combination of communists and their leftwing allies 
who are certain to field joint candidates in the runoffs were 
actually ahead in total number of votes 
no results were available for the remaining constituencies nor 
in mondays voting for the third house of parliament the 160seat 
labor chamber 
the third house is a remnant of yugoslavias communiststyle 
constitution 
tudjman said that once his party assumes power its first tasks 
will be to prepare a new westernstyle demoncratic constitution 
for croatia and to discuss yugoslavias future with other states in 
the federation 
he told journalists yugoslavia could continue to exist only if 
it becomes a loose alliance of semiindependent states 
tudjmans party waged a campaign based largely on national 
sentiments ranged against the cdu were serbs who comprise about 
10 percent of croatias 48 million people 
the cdu has been accused in serbia yugoslavias largest 
communistruled state of being fascist and separatist 
serbia and croatia the secondlargest state have been rivals 
since they united in yugoslavia in the aftermath of world war i 
yugoslavia is currently a loose federation slovenia and croatia 
now have held yugoslavias first postworld war ii multiparty 
elections macedonia and the republic of bosnia and herzegovina 
plan similar elections later this year communistruled montenegro 
and serbia have not legalized opposition parties 
tudjman said his party would strive to enlist other democratic 
forces in forming croatias new government he left open the 
possibility of inviting representatives of the serbian community to 
serve in the administration 
a cdu government will stop the extraction of croatias 
wealth by belgrade tudjman said 
belgrade serves as both federal capital and serbias capital 
croatia says serbia unfairly dominates federal authorities 
tudjman said his partys economic program would be one based 
on a market economy in which no ideology will be allowed to 
interfere ever again 
he said private and joint stock companies would receive support 
but his party would not allow wholesale privatization of state 
firms

the independent beirut newspaper annahar 
said tuesday that proiranian kidnappers will not free any more 
us hostages unless israel releases arab prisoners 
it said the shiite moslem militants also expect the release of 
15 radicals from a kuwaiti prison for bombing the us and french 
embassies in kuwait in 1983 before another goodwill gesture is 
made and more captives are freed 
sundays release of robert polhill 55 of new york after 39 
months in captivity raised hopes another western hostage could be 
freed 
polhill and fellow us educators jesse turner of boise idaho 
and alann steen of boston were abducted in beirut on jan 24 1987 
by a group known as islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
freedom for the kuwaiti prisoners has been the key demand of 
another organization known as islamic jihad or holy war which 
holds american hostages terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped on march 16 1985 and educator sutherland 
58 of fort collins colo on june 9 1985 
five other americans four britons two west germans two swiss 
an italian and an irishman are also missing and believed held in 
lebanon 
the united states refuses to pressure kuwait on the hostage 
issue 
annahar said polhills release was of a humanitarian nature 
and not related to any secret deal with washington 
the israelibacked south lebanon army militia reportedly 
released four prisoners tuesday to mark the moslem holiday of eid 
alfitr sources in south lebanon said but they denied it was part 
of a deal to free western hostages 
israel television said the four were from south lebanon and were 
not involved in guerrilla attacks 
israel also plans to free prisoners for the holiday but israeli 
officials insisted this had nothing to do with demands for 
goodwill gestures 
even so such gestures could be read as a positive sign by 
radical groups holding the hostages 
sources close to the 2500member sla speaking on condition of 
anonymity said sla commander antoine lahad will free perhaps 12 
prisoners from the 300 lebanese shiites and palestinians held in 
khiam prison in south lebanon 
the sources said such releases are traditional during the 
holiday they denied lahad would free up to 40 prisoners as

christian militia chieftain samir geagea 
imposed a sea blockade on gen michel aouns forces in the latest 
escalation of their 3monthold power struggle police said tuesday 
the rival christian forces also exchanged heavy artillery and 
mortar fire tuesday striking residential areas of east beirut and 
towns throughout the christian enclave 
police said one person was killed and four wounded in earlier 
shelling but there were no reports of casualties from the latest 
fighting at least 894 people have been killed and 2399 wounded 
since jan 30 when the two sides began their fight for control of 
lebanons christian enclave 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said geageas boats began the blockade monday and were 
preventing even fishing boats from sailing off the threemile 
stretch of coast held by aouns troops 
security sources said the lebanese forces have one gunboat one 
patrol boat and about 20 speedboats fitted ith machine guns and 
rocket launchers 
aoun is reported to have two crippled gunboats hidden somewhere 
near dbaye a coastal village north of beirut which is the only 
outlet to the sea for his forces 
the lebanese forces blockade was clearly aimed at preventing 
aoun from shipping in ammunition and weapons through dbaye 
on monday the lebanese forces boats intercepted a passenger 
boat and refused to let it dock at a makeshift port operated by 
aouns troops near dbaye the police spokeman said 
a militia communique said the boat was not carrying any 
passengers it did not say how many crewmen were on board or give 
the boats registry 
the militia boats also intercepted an unidentified motor launch 
that had left the dbaye area and was heading north the police 
spokesman said 
he said the two vessels were escorted by the militia boats to 
the port of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
geageas 6000strong militia which has a reserve force of 
30000 men controls the northern and southern edges to aouns 
narrow enclave and holds most of the christian enclaves 
28milelong coastline 
the lebanese forces have used howitzers and rocket launchers to 
fire on vessels approaching aouns territory 
the 310squaremile christian enclave about onetenth of 
lebanon is ringed on its landward sides by syrian troops and their 
moslem militia allies 
aoun with some 19000 troops moved against geagea in january 
in a bid to crush his only serious challenger for control of the 
christian enclave 
but geageas militia held on and the rival armies have fought 
each other to an inconclusive standstill in the bloodiest clash 
between christian rivals since lebanons civil war erupted in 1975 
aoun refuses to recognize president elias hrawi a maronite 
catholic or accept an arab leaguebrokered peace treaty that hrawi 
is supposed to implement aoun contends the treaty legitimizes the 
occupation of lebanon by 40000 syrian soldiers 
geagea has recognized the syrianbacked hrawi

newspaper publishers may be close to winning 
a 6yearold guerilla war with the bell telecommunications 
companies over who can transmit electronic information in the 
future a publisher said tuesday 
robert m johnson publisher president and chief executive 
officer of newsday inc of melville ny reported that congress 
is likely to pass a bill soon setting a telecommunications public 
policy 
we think we are in as strong a position as weve ever been 
said johnson who has testified in congress on behalf of the 
american newspaper publishers association his report was given at 
a luncheon of the anpas 104th annual convention at the century 
plaza hotel 
johnson said the bell companies have set aside a 25 million 
war chest to fight for the right to publish information on its 
electronic circuits he said bell seeks to launch an electronic 
yellow pages which would compete directly with newspaper 
advertising 
such actions would violate a 1984 federal court decision that 
set out the principle of diversity in dividing atampt into separate 
companies he said 
citing antitrust laws us district judge harold greene held 
that those who control telecommunication lines should not also 
control the information that goes over those lines johnson said 
for the next six years we were engaged in guerilla war he 
said recounting how bell companies lobbied for exceptions and in 
some cases they just violated the consent decree 
johnson said that in the past year a task force of the anpa has 
worked with congress to see if we can come up with a legislative 
solution 
the result of those long negotiations was a new draft bill 
he said it is from our point of view the best piece of 
legislation weve seen emerge from congress to protect the 
diversity principle 
however the bill has not yet been passed and a court appeal of 
the original federal order has sent that back to greene for 
reconsideration johnson said 
the outcome will determine whether the newspaper industry is 
going to face a whole new group of competitors in the electronic 
information services he said

animal research supporters marked the 
35th anniversary of the salk polio vaccine tuesday by wheeling an 
iron lung to a rally by opponents of animal experimentation 
the iron lung was once used to treat patients of the disease 
which was finally conquered by a vaccine developed from animal 
research 
the machine stood in the midst of an angry confrontation at the 
university of californiaberkeley where hundreds of signwielding 
scientists and students on both sides of the issue clashed 
at least 28 protesters were arrested 
the rally included a rowdy march around the campus to mark world 
laboratory animal liberation week about 250 of the animalresearch 
opponents chanted during the burning in effigy of an anonymous 
researcher with a bloodred dollar sign on its white jacket 
the protesters vegetarians against vivisection purplehaired 
punks wearing chains veterinarians humanities professors and 
students holding pictures of mutilated monkeys confronted a row 
of police in riot gear at a 14 million animal research facility 
under construction 
some tossed stink bombs at police while others knocked down a 
chainlink fence shortly afterward a halfdozen protesters 
chained themselves to the fence of a psychology building where 
other research is conducted several windows were broken 
stop the testing and torture some signs read 
vivisection the sacrifice of creatures we regard as inferior 
beings differs little from concentration camps or slave traders 
read another 
the protesters claiming ucberkeley researchers use and destroy 
80000 animals a year passed out leaflets accusing five professors 
of irresponsibility negligence and cruelty 
one of those cited dr charles s nicoll of the department of 
integrative biology strongly defended animal research 
no question about it nicoll said a small percentage of 
animal research is pretty horrid pretty gruesome but these 
animals are anesthetized theyre not treated without care and 
concern its not very nice to take a healthy animal and cause it 
to have brain damage but it is a less nice thing to do to not try 
to help the 500000 humans who suffer brain injuries every year 
unless we do animal research on things like brain damage we 
will never be able to help braininjured humans recover he said 
nicoll said scientists learn a lot from research on animals 
most of which causes the subjects no discomfort 
researcher sharon russell a physiologist said the protesters 
mean well but are misguided 
we love animals and we dont want to torture them and see them 
mistreated and we dont allow that russell said there are 
firm rules about research methods i feel good about my work 
she noted how animal research led to development of the salk 
polio vaccine saving millions of children from what was an 
epidemic in the 1950s 
but dr elliot katz a san rafael veterinarian and member of in 
defense of animals said researchers then had fewer alternatives 
we have other ways of testing the effectiveness and safety of 
vaccines now he said 
also tuesday 27 protesters in maryland were arrested during a 
midday demonstration by about 300 opponents of animal research at 
the national institutes of health authorities said charges 
included trespassing assault on a police officer and resisting 
arrest 
after speeches criticizing the institutes role in animal 
experimentation the group marched to the veterinary resources 
branch nih security officers formed a line around the building 
and protesters were warned that anyone crossing police lines would 
be arrested

us sen malcolm wallop confirmed tuesday 
the air force wants to cancel deployment of mx missiles on rail 
cars and slow midgetman missile production but said the proposal 
will not prevail 
this is something that was forwarded to secretary of defense 
dick cheney and will not be approved wallop rwyo a member of 
the senate armed services committee said in a telephone interview 
the air force suggested the cuts after cheney requested the 
armed services develop defense priorities within the constraints of 
the 1992 budget wallop said 
it was produced by an air force staff person over the easter 
break wallop said these are selections of the air forces 
priority they will not be the priority of the bush administration 
or the secretary of defense 
the los angeles times reported tuesday the air force also wants 
to cut its b2 stealth bomber force in half to meet the budget 
constraints the times citing unidentified pentagon sources said 
the air force wants cheney to shift the us nuclear arsenal from 
land missiles to bombers and submarines 
the air force recommended a fleet of 65 b2 stealth bombers 
rather than the 132 radarevading planes originally sought the 
newspaper reported 
if approved the cutback of landbased missiles would be a break 
with bush administration policy to modernize all the nuclear 
arsenal 
wallop did not name the soure of the recommendations but the 
times said air force secretary donald b rice sent them to cheney 
on friday 
defense officials also said cheney and top pentagon advisers 
would resist 
cheney has argued that the united states must respond to the 
soviet unions modernization of its weapons 
but cheney also has told the military that budgets for 
longrange nuclear weapons will fall by 3 percent to 5 percent 
annually over the next five years 
once source told the times that ending the mx railgarrison 
peacekeeper program and going slow with midgetman production 
could save as much as 15 billion 
cheney is expected to tell congressional committees on thursday 
that he will recommend b2 bomber production but will adopt the 
air forces proposal to reduce their numbers 
the air force said the 10warhead mx missiles should be based in 
silos built to house older missiles rather than ride the nations 
rail system on special cars construction of the railgarrison 
project is scheduled to begin this june and be operational by june 
1992 
the singlewarhead midgetman missile would not go into full 
production before the end of the century the proposed force of 500 
midgetman missiles would replace the mx in silos scattered across 
wyoming and nebraska 
the midgetman originally was to be ferried across the western 
united states on trucks 
the air force also would cancel a request for more than 2 
billion that cheney proposed to spend on rail cars for the mx the 
times said 
pentagon sources said the air force recently urged cheney to 
approve production of five to 10 b2s a year for at least the next 
five years such a plan would keep annual spending on the b2 
program below 8 billion 
that would affect growth plans by the planes manufacturer 
northrop corp which hopes to increase annual b2 production to 30 
aircraft by 1995 
officials said the air forces plans for slowed nuclear missile 
modernization resembles a package of proposals advanced by sen sam 
nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services committee

burning crude oil from derailed railroad 
tank cars was extinguished tuesday and environmental officials 
tried to contain a goopy mixture of chemicals and oil that spilled 
into an allegheny river tributary 
fires began after 29 cars of a 97car freight train owned by 
buffalo amp pittsburgh railroad inc derailed sunday in a steep 
ravine 45 miles north of pittsburgh two tank cars carrying crude 
oil exploded late monday and workers barely escaped injury 
a major assault was launched tuesday morning after flames 
had died down sufficiently for foam retardant to suffocate two 
fires burning at the site along buffalo creek a popular trout 
stream said don grafton fire chief of the worthington volunteer 
fire department in armstrong county 
everything really looks super it looks like we have it 
licked grafton said 
investigators from the federal railroad administration and 
national transportation safety board did not know what caused the 
derailment which forced the evacuation of 200 people 
janet burke one of some 50 people still out of their homes 
tuesday said she her husband and 17yearold son were home sunday 
night when the house started to shake 
they said run just as fast as you can run she said 
you could see the train going down the tracks there were sparks 
everywhere and then there was an explosion the whole woods were 
on fire 
mrs burke said she saw the vinyl siding on her home begin to 
melt and she had no idea tuesday if her home was still intact 
the cars were in our yard the railroad cars were that 
close she said it was such a scary thing 
the crash released an undetermined quantity of crude oil and 
sodium hydroxide a caustic chemical used to clean drains into the 
creek which joins the allegheny 10 to 15 miles downstream the 
allegheny supplies drinking water to several communities in the 
pittsburgh area 
crews were able to remove 21 tanker cars monday but the 
remaining cars were either on fire or too close to the flames to 
move firefighters sprayed the tankers with water to keep them 
cool but stopped later that day when state environmental officials 
discovered 30000 to 50000 gallons of the waterandoil mixture 
was spilling over makeshift dikes and into the creek 
shortly after they stopped the spraying the two tank cars 
exploded 
the only thing we saw in front of us back of us on top of 
us was fire said john kaus fire marshal in neighboring 
allegheny county and deputy coordinator of its emergency management 
agency it was like walking through hell 
sodium hydroxide also leaked into the stream from the saturated 
ground killing thousands of fish state fish commission officials 
said 
theres too many to count said emil svetahor a commission 
official this will be a longterm recovery 
railroad vice president john bell said 15000 gallons of the 
chemical was unaccounted for 
we believe a substantial amount of that is still in the ground 
or has been picked up by booms he said but we know some of it 
got in the creek 
crews worked tuesday to remove the remaining eight cars from the 
site kaus said four of the cars contained a total 55000 gallons 
of crude oil 
the oilchemical mixture was floating along the surface in 
clumps not like a sheen said betsy mallison spokeswoman for 
the state department of environmental resources 
however much of the oil from sundays crash burned she said 
communities along the allegheny braced tuesday for possible 
problems to their water supplies when the mixture passes their 
water intakes 
fifty craigsville residents stayed with friends and family or at 
the worthington fire hall while waiting for an evacuation order to 
be lifted

right mentality

newspaper publishers must move rapidly to 
recycle newsprint to prevent the government from moving in and 
imposing regulations the chairman of a publishers task force said 
tuesday 
frank a bennack jr president and chief executive officer of 
the hearst corp new york offered a report on recycling in his 
role as chairman of the american newspaper publishers association 
newsprint resource task force 
in an address to the anpas 104th annual convention bennack 
painted a grim picture of vanishing landfills to absorb the 
nations increasing output of solid waste 
he said publishers have resolved to double the amount of 
recycled newsprint used in the coming year reaching a total of 46 
million tons 
aggressive movement on recycling will prevent government 
intervention he said 
we believe efforts to control newsprint can mean efforts to 
control the press he said the prospect of dealing with a 
regulated newsprint industry calls up an array of terrifying 
unknowns 
bennack said that at least two states have already mandated that 
newspapers use recycled newsprint but he insisted such official 
orders will be unnecessary if publishers act on the recycling issue 
voluntarily 
he said 35 percent of newspapers currently are recycled and 
publishers aim to bring that up to 50 percent 
our goal must be reached if newspapers are to deal with the 
irrevocable closing of landfills he said 
bennack said the nation had 18000 landfills available in 1979 
today only 6500 remain and that figure will diminish to 4200 by 
1995 he said 
in 15 to 20 years the last existing landfills will be 
closed he said but this society will be producing thousands 
of tons of solid waste 
bennack stressed that although newspapers are among the most 
visible recyclable items they make up only 8 percent of solid 
waste going into landfills he said newspapers already are the 
second largest recycled material in the country

the former communist party 
chief of troubled kosovo province and 13 other prominent ethnic 
albanians were acquitted tuesday of inciting antigovernment 
protests 
this is a victory for justice in yugoslavia said the 
tearyeyed exparty leader azem vlasi as he embraced his wife 
the sixmonth political trial was yugoslavias biggest in 
decades 
chief judge ismet emra ruled lack of evidence public prosecutor 
spasoje zamfirovic indicated he would ask a retrial tanjug news 
agency reported 
belgrade radio said thousands of ethnic albanians celebrated the 
43yearold vlasis release chanting azem azem and singing 
nationalist songs while minority serbs in the province were 
shocked by the outcome of the trial 
the acquittal was seen as a setback for serbian leader slobodan 
milosevic who pushed for holding the trial and for strongarm 
policies in kosovo which is part of the serbian republic 
politicians and the news media in yugoslavias western republics 
of slovenia and croatia denounced it as a show trial staged by 
the serbian leadership to intimidate albanians in kosovo human 
rights groups also criticized the trial vlasi was arrested in 
march 1989 
heavy riot police forces patrolled major towns in kosovo late 
tuesday fearing street celebrations could trigger intercommunal 
clashes the only incidents reported however was some minor 
stonethrowing involving vlasi supporters and police 
a state of emergency imposed in kosovo in march 1989 was lifted 
this month after kosovos police force came entirely under serbian 
control 
the 14 defendants were originally accused of 
counterrevolutionary activities for allegedly instigating a wave 
of protests by ethnic albanians in winter 1989 according to the 
indictment the protests culminated in an armed insurrection in 
kosovo that left numerous people dead 
last week the charges were modified to remove the threat of 
capital punishment 
kosovo where ethnic albanians are a 90 percent majority has 
been rocked more than a year by violent protests over 
constitutional amendments in serbia that gave yugoslavias largest 
republic almost complete control over the province at least 60 
people died in protests the past year 
kosovo previously enjoyed broad autonomy the amendments were 
said to be needed to protect slavs in kosovo from alleged 
harassment by ethnic albanians 
during the trial vlasi denied charges he instigated the unrest 
and claimed the trial was staged by milosevic his political 
archrival

department would not comment on any patient 
during questioning police said brady talked of god and about a 
mechanical device inside him that controls his actions 
hes suffering from hallucinations he was probably having one

dekalb public safety director thomas brown said the gunman 
muttered you dont know what all these people have done to me

president bush will invoke emergency authority 
to send 26 million in medical aid to nicaragua in time for the 
presidential inauguration wednesday of violeta chamorro 
congressional and administration sources said 
the move was timed to give vice president dan quayle the chance 
to deliver good news when he represents bush at the swearingin 
ceremony in managua the sources said quayle also will report 
progress toward sending previously promised food and other aid for 
the new government the sources said 
bushs request for 300 million to begin economic recovery in 
nicaragua part of an 870 million aid request that also includes 
panama had been stalled on capitol hill by a dispute over 
unrelated legislation that snarl was resolved late tuesday but it 
remained unlikely the full aid package would be approved 
immediately 
failure to approve the full aid package by chamorros 
inauguration should not be seen as an embarrassment said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash 
it is a matter of procedures here he told reporters we 
have procedures that obviously have to go forward and i think 
eventually that aid package will be voted 
the administration aid request for nicaragua is designed to help 
that country now among the poorest in the hemisphere recover 
from a decade of civil war and us trade sanctions it includes 
money to meet immediate needs for planting of crops and for fuel 
officials of the new government acknowledge they face a thorny 
challenge in meeting the expectations of the electorate for a 
better standard of living 
mrs chamorro was elected overwhelmingly in february elections 
to replace president daniel ortega of the leftist sandinista party 
her coalition was supported by the united states 
the medical assistance would be the first direct us aid to the 
central american country in nine years since president reagan cut 
off aid shortly after taking office in 1981 
bush is seeking 300 million as a first installment of aid for 
the country along with 500 million for panama but the aid 
package a version of which has been passed by the house had been 
held up in the senate by a dispute over childcare legislation 
the dispute was settled late tuesday and the senate 
appropriations committee approved the money measure with the full 
300 million for nicaragua and 420 million for panama the same 
amounts previously approved by the house 
the panel voted 1514 against an effort by chairman robert c 
byrd dwva and sen patrick leahy dvt to cut the panama aid 
to 300 million and use the money saved to help us businesses 
compete in eastern europe 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
expected the money measure to be on the senate floor wednesday but 
could not predict how long it would take to complete action 
the senate committees version of the bill totaling about 34 
billion also included domestic spending for programs like disaster 
relief the census bureau food stamps and head start and it 
included 10 million for use if the united states wants to 
establish an embassy in lithuania 
the measure was nearly 1 billion more expensive than the house 
version but also included larger cuts in pentagon spending to pay 
for the increase 
bush made the urgency of the supplemental money bill the top 
item on his agenda when he met with congressional leaders at the 
white house on tuesday participants said house minority leader 
robert michel rill said bush sought to turn up the heat on 
mitchell to schedule action on the measure 
later speaking to a group visiting the white house bush asked 
if you have any spare time please call your friendly senator and 
tell them to get going and get this legislation passed because we 
are a symbol up here for these countries in our own neighborhood 
the stopgap medical aid is being provided under a littleused 
section of the foreign assistance law that permits the president to 
use up to 10 million a year for any emergency purposes so 
long as congress is notified the administration began making those 
notifications late monday the sources said

the soviet union said tuesday that 
economic problems will not be solved by rigid central control but 
by encouraging market forces and guaranteeing social justice 
soviet deputy foreign minister ernest y obminsky told a special 
un session on economic coperation that each country bears the 
major responsibility for its own development 
his speech on the second day of a sixday session on helping 
sick third world economies was considered a major statement 
reflecting moscows new views on liberalizing the soviet economy 
and coordinating foreign aid with market reforms in recipient 
nations 
like speakers from industrialized and developing nations 
obminsky struck a balance between the need for poor nations to 
undertake economic restructuring and for betteroff nations to help 
them where they need it in debt relief commodity prices 
inflation and trade 
because of the soviet unions own economic woes moscow is less 
enthusiastic about pouring money into poor leftist third world 
nations where the aid may be mismanaged under rigid central 
control 
but obminsky reaffirmed the soviet unions longstanding and 
continuing commitment to helping less fortunate nations 
he said that despite difficulties faced by the soviet economy 
the government continues to provide major third world aid 
but he said awareness is growing that economic objectives may be 
achieved most efficiently not through rigid centralization but 
rather through encouraging market mechanisms managed by economic 
methods while ensuring adequate social guarantees for the 
population and equality of all forms of property 
in the soviet union he said the government is developing a new 
package of laws to speed transition from a statecontrolled economy 
to a regulated market economy 
he said soviet plans include reform of the financial system and 
the pricing system establishment of commodity exhanges and 
eventually stock exchanges 
on monday industrialized nations called upon the developing 
world to bear the primary responsibility for galvanizing their own 
stagnating economies but said the west stands ready to deliver 
major aid to market systems 
also at the united nations on tuesday 
pakistani foreign minister sahabzada yaqubkhan accused india 
of using massive and indiscriminate force to suppress moslem 
secessionists in kashmir and asked india to stop it his statement 
came on the eve of a meeting with indian foreign minister inder k 
gujar to discuss the turmoil in kashmir claimed by both nations 
india is overwhelmingly hindu 
the united states canada the european community and others 
urged the ethiopian government and rebels to observe an immediate 
ceasefire to ensure distribution of food and prevent mass 
starvation famine threatens an estimated 45 million ethiopians in 
northern wollo tigre and eritrea donor nations have committed 
food aid but civil war prevents supplies from reaching the people

saudi arabias top religious body 
announced tuesday that the crescent moon heralding a new moslem 
month had not been sighted and the month of ramadan fasting would 
continue until thursday 
the decision by saudi arabias ruling clerics has strong 
influence in the moslem world because of the prestigious place the 
kingdom holds as home to the religions holiest shrines in mecca 
and medina 
the delay means most of the worlds estimated 1 billion moslems 
will end their monthlong dawntodusk fast on thursday rather than 
wednesday as was expected 
islamic months end when a crescent moon can be sighted by eye 
the months can last 29 or 30 days 
the fast month of ramadan commemorates the time when islamic 
tradition holds that the angel gabriel gave the moslem holy book 
the koran to the prophet mohammed more than 14 centuries ago 
in some countries such as iran and egypt ramadan started a day 
later and can be expected to end thursday or friday

the exxon corp pipeline that leaked 
567000 gallons of heating oil into a busy waterway between new 
york and new jersey had cracked a long time before the spill state 
officials said tuesday 
the report contradicted exxons contention that recent damage 
caused the underwater pipe to burst and foul the arthur kill 
waterway on jan 1 however exxon issued a statement tuesday 
saying the report confirmed its conclusions that the pipe had been 
damaged and was not corroded 
the statecommissioned study conducted by battelle co of 
columbus ohio concluded that the pipe suffered a 10foot dent a 
substantial period of time before the final leak occurred 
the damaged pipe didnt rupture earlier because oil was pumped 
through it at a relatively low pressure between exxon facilities in 
bayonne and elizabeth the study said 
exxons statement said the pipeline was pressuretested four 
times a year the last time on dec 18 1989 
this type of rigorous test would have detected a small leak in 
the line the statement said 
an exxon spokesman said the company would have no further 
comment

the man who built a bomb that maimed a 
5yearold girl at a k mart store a year ago committed suicide 
within 36 hours of the blast authorities said tuesday 
david l swinford 19 shot himself in the head as he sat in a 
car on a rural road on april 19 1989 a few hours after having 
discussed the bombing with his mother and stepfather said charles 
petersen resident agent in charge of the us bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms in indianapolis 
swinford who graduated from high school in 1988 was working at 
a restaurant at the time of the bombing petersen said 
following disagreements his parents had asked him to move out 
of the home he added 
petersen said authorities knew of no motive for the bombing 
swinford of rural noblesville was identified as a possible 
suspect within days of the april 17 1989 bombing but 
investigators only recently developed conclusive evidence that he 
built the device petersen said 
petersen said swinfords stepfather david whitesell contacted 
authorities shortly after the suicide and suggested his stepson may 
have been responsible for the blast that took off part of the left 
hand of erin bower of indianapolis 
erin now 6 picked up the pumptype toothpaste dispenser in 
which the pipe bomb had been concealed she now wears an artificial 
hand and was scheduled this month for a cornea transplant in her 
left eye also damaged in the explosion 
her father kevin bower released a statement tuesday saying 
if this individual was in fact responsible maureen and i feel 
sorry for him and for the circumstances which must have been 
present to lead to such an act 
we would like to get all of this behind us and focus on what 
lies ahead 
petersen said there was no evidence about whether swinford 
actually placed the bomb on the shelf 
he may have had an accomplice he said 
tests on a screwdriver and knife recovered from swinfords car 
determined that they were used in making the bomb petersen said 
he described the bomb as a very inventive device that was 
filled with explosive black powder and bbs 
swinford knew about bombmaking and electrical wiring from 
building crude firecracker devices with friends and from working 
with his stepfather in electronic installation petersen said 
certainly he did not expect to hurt a young girl petersen 
said of swinford 
k mart officials learned of swinfords involvement recently from 
atf agents said spokeswoman leslie kota at k mart headquarters in 
troy mich 
it is obviously a very unfortunate set of circumstances all 
the way around it compounds the tragedy for both families she 
said 
kota said company officials had not decided what would happen to 
the 20000 reward k mart offered for information leading to the 
arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing 
separate rewards totaling 30000 also had been offered

gen humberto ortega one of the 
leaders of the sandinista revolution will remain as commander of 
the nicaraguan army after presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro is sworn in wednesday a source in the incoming government 
said tuesday 
there are some extremists who want the sandinistas wiped out 
in one fell swoop the source close to mrs chamorro said 
describing some factions in the united national opposition that 
cant be he ortega will be eased out but not for a while 
the plan calls for keeping gen ortega as commander in chief of 
the army and mrs chamorro as defense minister said the source 
who refused to be identified by name 
the retention of gen ortega president daniel ortegas brother 
as army commander was likely to heighten divisions inside mrs 
chamorros coalition and make it more difficult for her to persuade 
the usbacked contra rebels to disarm 
the contras and members of the chamorro coalition have demanded 
the army be purged of sandinista loyalists 
it is unacceptable that members representative of the fsln 
sandinista front remain in highlevel posts in the army interior 
ministry and other government structures unos political council 
said in a statement tuesday the council has frequently been at 
odds with the circle of chamorro advisers putting her government 
together 
that statement continued if the executive were to take a 
decision opposite to the previous statement the political council 
will not support such a decision nor accept responsibility for the 
consequences 
according to the source gen ortega will remain in charge of 
the army but answer to mrs chamorro who as both defense minister 
and president will be supreme commander of the armed forces 
mrs chamorro will keep the defense ministry post until an 
appropriate person can be found to take over the source said 
that jibed with a leak in la prensa the chamorro family 
newspaper which said monday that mrs chamorro would take the 
defense post 
gen ortega was one of the most prominent members of the 
sandinista partys national directorate until he quit monday in 
accordance with an agreement to depoliticize the armed forces 
the nineman directorate which included both ortega brothers 
had not changed its membership since the sandinistas overthrew 
dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
all officers in the sandinista peoples army and the security 
forces resigned leadership positions in the sandinista front 
presumably making them eligible to stay on after mrs chamorro 
takes over

on this month 15 years ago phnom penh fell to 
khmer rouge troops thirteen days later saigon surrendered to 
north vietnamese forces the vietnam war was over 
but as an abc news special coming up thursday reminds us the 
khmer rouges takeover of cambodia marked the beginning of a 
murderous fouryear reign of terror in which an estimated one 
million cambodians were killed 
the vietnamese drove the khmer rouge out but fighting 
continues guerrillas from a coalition of two noncommunist groups 
and the communist khmer rouge are battling those of cambodias 
government 
reported by peter jennings abcs special from the killing 
fields examines if the united states in supporting that 
antigovernment alliance might be helping the khmer rouge come 
back 
jennings anchorman of the toprated world news tonight 
spent a week in january traveling to cambodia and vietnam for the 
special 
he also flew to beijing for an interview with the nominal head 
of the antigovernment coalition prince norodom sihanouk the 
former cambodian ruler whose overthrow in 1970 by americanbacked 
forces was followed five years later by the khmer rouge takeover 
i found him to be sad in some cases very defensive on other 
issues the anchorman said when i asked him about the 
conventional wisdom that hes a puppet of the khmer rouge he 
became extremely defensive he said hes in charge 
jennings vietnam trip was his first since 1965 when he was on 
his first tour as anchorman of abcs weeknight newscasts he was a 
veritable kid then as anchors go sent for two months to cover the 
early part of the long us military involvement in vietnam 
his dossier now is full of foreigncorrespondent credits but on 
his first time in vietnam he candidly says he didnt really know 
much about the subject and was more than a dilettante than 
anything else 
still his return to vietnam contained its share of deja vu 
experiences softened by time and nature 
when he flew from bangkok over cambodia and vietnam to what now 
is ho chi minh city jenning said he found that from the air the 
only visible remnants of the war are the craters left by b52 
bombings 
theyre all over the place some filled with water some 
planted with rice he said 
he also took a drive that would have been a suicide run during 
the war motoring up route one from ho chi minh city to phnom penh 
passing through the socalled parrots beak area 30 miles west of 
vietnams capital 
a battleground during the war its quiet now he said and 
you can walk around there day and night without fear not so 
the socalled liberated zones of the cambodian guerrillas near 
the thai border 
all the fighting is being done on the western side of the 
country said jennings whose cambodian travels took him to khmer 
rougecontrolled refugee camps and two contested border towns 
sisophon and batdambang 
he shook his head when asked if any cambodian with whom he spoke 
in phnom penh mentioned the 1984 movie that dramatized the bloody 
nightmare of the khmer rouuge takeover the killing fields 
no theyd been through the real ones he said were 
fortunate however in the fact that a great many americans saw the 
movie 
that may give many viewers a base of knowledge for 
understanding thursdays special he said i think people know

a good read morley safer who helped cover the vietnam war for 
cbs has a new book out flashbacks which he wrote after 
returning to vietnam last year for 60 minutes 
the book is wellwritten with sharp insights and moments of 
humor and irony safer is compassionate for those who fought and 
suffered in the war regardless of whose side they were on not so 
for those in the halls of power during the war he particularly

the two major us spanishlanguage 
television networks are americanizing their programming with lively 
new shows in a battle for increasing hispanic viewership and 
advertising dollars 
telemundo and univision officials say the push for new programs 
many patterned after popular englishlanguage shows coincides with 
a surge in spanish television viewers in major markets 
particularly los angeles 
the programming is a fresh alternative to the timehonored 
mainstays of spanish television melodramatic soap operas or 
novelas shootemup mexican movies and sunday variety shows 
this year alone univision has introduced fama y fortuna fame 
and fortune a lifestyles of the rich and famous clone 
cita con el amor a date with love a hispanic version of 
the dating game and cristina a talkshow takeoff of oprah 
winfrey 
the network also began airing a talk show featuring hispanic 
comedian paul rodriguez in march 
telemundo has countered with a mtvproduced rock video program 
in spanish and a variety of new game shows uno nunca sabe one 
never knows a candid camerastyle game show adivinelo 
con senas guess it with signs a charades game show featuring 
two teams of celebrities and la feria de la alegria the fair of 
happiness a variety and game show featuring an assortment of 
contests and entertainment 
the push comes at a crucial time particularly for cashstrapped 
univision which in february was unable to make interest payments 
of about 10 million due on 270 million in junk bonds it had 
issued 
hallmark cards inc which owns 635 percent of univision 
earlier this year had offered to pay 131 million for the bonds it 
said at least 90 percent of each issue must be tendered before it 
would be obligated to buy any of the securities and that univision 
was authorized to file for bankruptcy if the tender offer was not 
successful 
hallmark announced on april 17 that it was dropping that 
requirement of the offer and had accepted 2519 million of the 
bonds for payment averting the possibility of bankruptcy 
a recent los angeles arbitron survey showed spanish television 
viewership jumped 52 percent in february from the same month the 
previous year according to maureen schultz audience research 
manager for kmex univisions los angeles affiliate 
hispanics now make up about 285 percent of los angelesarea 
residents and hispanic households account for about 214 percent 
of all los angelesarea households with televisions according to 
research figures from both networks 
nationwide there now are more than 20 million hispanics 
accounting for nearly 10 percent of the countrys total population 
network officials said 
our 1990 programming lineup coupled with the rapidly growing 
hispanic population which is increasing five times more rapidly 
than the general population will make advertisers stand up and 
take note said rosita peru a univision vice president and 
programming director 
along with new network programs local affiliates have beefed up 
news coverage in an attempt to attract new viewers and develop 
viewer loyalty for national and international news coverage 
univision depends on its own correspondents and telemundo 
contracts with cnn for specially prepared spanish programming 
an especially competitive news war has erupted in los angeles 
where univision affiliate kmex goes headtohead with telemundo 
affiliate kvea 
it really is very competitive said kvea spokesman martin 
quiroz thats what makes it fun and what forces us to do 
better 
both stations have new general managers and news directors 
news sets the stations whole image said kmex general 
manager emilio nicolas jr 
univision officials hope a new multimedia service launched in 
late march which telemundo is not involved with will help more 
advertisers reach the spanishspeaking market by magazine 
television and telephone 
whittle communications of knoxville tenn said 90 percent of 
the 10 million advertising time and space for one year had been 
sold when the new service was started 
whittle has predicted the new service will reach an estimated 
500000 hispanic magazine readers and nearly 90 percent of hispanic 
homes with televisions sponsors include american airlines procter 
amp gamble atampt and kinney shoes

bill totten says he is proof that foreigners can 
crack the japanese market with the same formula that works 
elsewhere hard work and concern for customers 
but the computer software executive says those who succeed 
generally keep quiet not wanting to invite competition 
totten in contrast has been contributing articles to major 
newspapers and magazines overseas and appearing on japanese 
television to challenge the commonly held belief that japan is a 
closed market 
my experience has been that this has been a very open 
country contends the american who has lived in tokyo 21 years 
and speaks japanese 
far from encountering any trade barriers he says ive found 
it easier to do this business in japan than to do it in my own 
country or for a japanese to do it here 
he is president of one of japans largest software firms kk 
ashisuto which reported sales of more than 59 million in 1989 and 
claims a 50 percent share of the independent software market 
go talk to cocacola who sells 70 percent of the soft drinks 
sold here in japan and find out what bad things they say about 
japan go talk to du pont and ask what their complaints are schick 
sells 70 percent of the razors sold in the country do they 
badmouth the japanese he said in an interview 
totten arrived in 1969 as the representative for a us software 
company but after its headquarters rebuffed his attempts to sell 
packaged software to the japanese he quit and started his own firm 
with two japanese partners in 1972 
totten says he never studied much about doing business with the 
japanese but he has sweated to make all his products usable in the 
japanese language and adapted them to japanese tastes 
the 6foot4 american puts in 12 hours at work most days and 
calls on hundreds of customers a year 
last fall tottens firm plunged into the market for personal 
computer software with five packages at 60 each a fraction of the 
cost of competing brands more than 160000 packages have been 
sold and all five types are on the bestseller lists 
totten who so far has been mainly distributing americanmade 
software after adapting it for the japanese market says he fears 
that the us software industry may be beginning to lose its edge 
ashisuto revenues dependence on imports from the united states 
fell from 99 percent in 1988 to 95 percent last year and is 
expected to decline to 80 percent this year he says 
totten says american firms have refused to spend time adapting 
or marketing their products in japan and are getting pushed out by 
a new generation of highquality japanese products 
us and japanese government negotiators have been busy in 
recent months in talks on opening japans market wider to american 
supercomputers satellites and forest products and on changing 
deepseated business practices 
japan has promised among other things to make it easier to 
open large stores in japan spend more on public works pressure 
corporate groups to reduce the emphasis on personal ties in making 
purchasing decisions and try to solve soaring land costs 
to totten however such trade frictions only reflect two 
silly governments fighting with each other he says private 
citizens should become involved before the two countries are at 
each others throats 
i consider both countries my country i love the united states 
and i love japan he says 
on one hand he adds i would not want to see the us lose 
its software industry out of ignorance or silly mistakes and im 
trying to talk to my friends in the industry that weve got to 
correct things 
on the other i have two children who speak only japanese i 
want the japanese economy to remain a healthy economy for my 
children

communist symbols are vanishing from 
eastern europe but austria is keeping its hammer and sickle which 
had nothing to do with communism in the first place 
because neighboring nations in what used to be called the soviet 
bloc have been stripping wheat sheaves red stars and other 
communist symbols from their coats of arms the question also arose 
in austria 
in 1919 austrian legislators met in vienna to create a republic 
from the ruins of the austrohungarian empire they adopted a coat 
of arms in which the austrian eagle expressed commitment to the 
common man by holding a hammer for workers and a sickle for 
farmers in its claws 
in 1945 parliament voted to add broken shackles dangling from 
the eagles legs symbolize release from nazi domination 
the debate about what to do now has been spirited both in 
parliament and outside 
popular sentiment appears to be against removing the implements 
from the eagles claws of 24 letters from readers printed by the 
masscirculation tabloid kurier in march only five were in favor 
josef riegler one of the five said even during my first 
visits abroad after world war ii i was often asked whether the 
soviet occupiers had forced us to include the hammer and sickle in 
our state emblem i heard similar questions later from visitors to 
vienna 
some of those opposed to change expressed anger at what they 
considered an attempt by politicans to magnify a small issue 
others like brigitte michalko were defiant those who 
considered us communists up to now because of our coat of arms can 
continue to do so as far as i care she wrote 
the broken chains added in 1945 added to the existing confusion 
some saw them as an echo of the communist manifesto which exhorts 
the proletariat to rise because you have nothing to lose but your 
chains 
in february the rightleaning freedom party began efforts in 
parliament to discard at least the hammer and sickle 
they are symbols for contempt of humanity death camps and 
suppression the partys resolution declared if they remained on 
the national emblem it said austria would be the only 
noncommunist country in europe whose state symbol symbolizes 
communism 
although the measure received wide publicity it initially was 
considered more symbolic than serious the freedom party has only 
18 members in the 183seat chamber and few people thought the 
motion would receive the necessary twothirds vote 
the issue gained extra weight when a group of legislators from 
the austrian peoples party partner with the socialists in the 
governing coalition presented a similar motion 
sides were taken the peoples party split on the issue and the 
socialists opposed any change 
felix ermacora a sponsor of the peoples party motion said in 
an interview that changing the emblem could avoid 
misunderstandings abroad 
there is the occasional misconception when people look at our 
coat of arms on our passports for instance and see the hammer and 
sickle he said 
peoples party spokesman anton wressnig said the action by 
ermacoras group was independent changing the emblem is not an 
official concern of the party he said in a telephone interview 
and described the issue as relatively unimportant 
heinz fischer a senior socialist party official said if we 
didnt change it in 1956 and 1968 there is no no need to do it 
now 
soviet invasions crushed an antstalinist uprising in hungary in 
1956 and a reform movement in czechoslovakia in 1968

the tide of democracy sweeping eastern 
europe is being felt in black africa but oneparty rule still 
predominates and three of the major states have publicly committed 
themselves to it 
tanzania has had only one party for 26 years and said this month 
the policy will not change kenya did the same and zimbabwes 
leader robert mugabe declared his intention to install oneparty 
rule 
if we have many political parties we will have chaos as 
different tribes rush to form theirs president daniel arap moi 
of kenya told trainee teachers at laikipia in central kenya 
tribal inclinations and consciousness is still paramount in the 
minds of many kenyans 
for now i say no to the multiparty system at least until we 
are cohesive enough as a nation he said 
kenya has 40 tribes in a population of 22 million ethnic 
feuding is common in parliament at public rallies and in the press 
moi a 66yearold a former teacher from the minority kalenjin 
tribe inherited the oneparty system in 1978 from the late 
president jomo kenyatta the nations founder kenyatta had banned 
opposition parties nine years earlier 
kenyatta created a de facto oneparty state by locking up his 
political opponents moi made it constitutional in 1982 
the presidents statement was his first on the subject since 
some other african states began considering more liberalized 
political systems this year 
he spoke after weeks of debate in nairobi newspapers about 
whether kenya should restore the style of democracy bequeathed to 
kenyatta when he led the former british colony to independence in 
1963 
writers supporting the status quo argued that kenya had 
prospered under the current system without tribal strife they 
said a return to the old order might cause ethnic violence and 
drive away tourists and investors 
those who wanted change said kenyans were politically mature 
enough for competition that recent reforms in eastern europe 
should be used as an example and that a parliamentary opposition 
would help check official corruption mismanagement and nepotism 
neighboring tanzania a nation of 100 tribes also was a british 
colony until independence in 1961 under julius nyerere 
unlike its wealthy capitalist cousin tanzania followed 
socialism based on eastern european models both nyerere and ali 
hassan mwinyi who succeeded him as president in 1985 have 
admitted the policies were flawed 
mwinyi 65 has adopted radical economic reforms prescribed by 
western lenders but has rejected suggestions that they be 
accompanied by political change 
while a multiparty system would be suitable for europeans it 
might not be the same with tanzania mwinyi told reporters in dar 
es salaam 
what africans want is a fair return for their sweat through a 
new international economic order this cannot be solved by the 
creation of 100 parties which can bring chaos instead of 
progress 
he said tanzanians had voted consistently for a single party as 
a way to guarantee national unity he did not mention a statement 
nyerere made in february that multiparty democracy now may be 
possible 
nyerere still chairman of the ruling chama cha mapinduzi party 
remains a powerful political figure five years after he resigned as 
president 
only a few of the 50 member nations of the organization of 
african unity have westernstyle democracies 
zimbabwe is one but president robert mugabe declared after an 
overwhelming victory in recent national elections that he will 
transform the former british colony of rhodesia into a oneparty 
state 
mugabe who led zimbabwe to independence 10 years ago said the 
elections were a mandate from the 48 million registered voters to 
get rid of the opposition 
his opponents accused mugabe 66 of seeking a dictatorship 
they noted that only 54 percent of the electorate voted and 
opposition parties got 20 percent of the votes although they won 
only three of the 150 parliament seats 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire said this week he would lift 
a 20yearold ban on opposition parties and his popular movement 
for the revolution since 1970 the only official party no longer 
would have special status 
he said the constitution of the former belgian colony would be 
rewritten and an interim government would be installed by april 24 
1991 to prepare for elections 
benin a former french colony is pledged to eliminate oneparty 
rule gabon is debating the question and there is pressure in the 
ivory coast for a freer political order 
cameroon and niger scenes of recent political upheavals have 
rejected multiparty politics 
significant signals of change are coming from unlikely quarters 
ethiopia and mozambique have abandoned their hardline marxist 
ideologies and the marxist leaders of angola have committed 
themselves to peace talks with usbacked guerrillas that if 
fruitful could lead to open elections

plea deal friday after more than three years at the center of a 
highly publicized and contentious assault on wall street crime that 
began in 1986 
milken 43 had staunchly maintained his innocence but reversed 
course in the face of a threatened new government indictment 
replacing the 98 fraud and racketeering counts brought in march 
1989 sources have said the plea includes no insider trading or 
racketeering charges 
in an arrangement unusual for a major figure in the wall street 
fraud crackdown milken will not be required to provide 
investigators with information to build cases against other figures 
as part of the plea bargain sources said 
rather he will be questioned by federal officials after 
sentencing an individual familiar with the deal confirmed monday 
that arrangement would reduce the governments leverage by making 
it impossible for prosecutors to recommend a stiffer prison term if 
milken does not cooperate 
however the government still could control his prison 
conditions or parole date if investigators were unsatisifed with 
his help if he refused to testify under immunity before a grand 
jury milken could face contempt charges 
while the nature of milkens future cooperation remains unclear 
observers said the government was likely to seek details about 
extensive and possibly unlawful links with the nations savings and 
loans 
milken controlled a complex network of thrifts and corporate 
clients that bought and sold each others bonds financed deals and 
made investments together thrifts were among drexels largest junk 
bond customers 
the securities and exchange commission the house banking 
committee and the resolution trust corp which is charged with 
rescuing the nations thrifts are examining savings and loan 
failures expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions 
sec enforcement director william mclucas declined to comment on 
the reported milken settlement he did say the commission has 
formed a unit on thrift and banking that is examining compliance 
with securities laws 
asked what area milken is most likely to be questioned about 
john c coffee jr a securities law professor at columbia 
university said i think it would chiefly be the savings and 
loan people because the government would love to get the sampls 
the government isnt likely to get much useful information 
because of the terms of the deal coffee said 
he suggested the government may have agreed to the cosmetic 
cooperation in order to obtain the plea and save face following a 
series of light sentences in related wall street cases milken is 
expected to receive about five years in prison although he faces 
up to 28 years 
i think the government wants to offset these rather equivocal 
pyrrhic victories with a final round that shows this was a true 
crime coffee said 
he said the government may have been willing to trade away 
milkens assistance in nabbing other drexel and wall street figures 
in exchange for his guilty plea because theyre rosencrantz and 
guildenstern off in the wings and hes hamlet 
the plea deal leaves unresolved charges against former drexel 
trader bruce newberg who was named in the original 98count 
indictment and cases against individuals who were expected to be 
named in a new indictment

the valdez oil spill returns to haunt exxon corp 
wednesday when shareholders vote on a six resolutions calling for 
americas largest oil company to be more sensitive to the 
environment 
the company whose public image has been blackened by the 
alaskan spill and numerous other accidents in the last year 
opposes all the proposals saying it already has taken steps to 
increase awareness and responsiveness 
not so said anne chapman a shareholder in denver who wants the 
company to report annually on its environmental performance 
i dont think theyve learned much at all and i hope that at 
the shareholders meeting that it will come home to them that there 
are people who really care mrs chapman said from her home in 
denver 
wednesdays meeting in houston is the first chance shareholders 
have had to present valdezrelated proposals although the spill 
dominated last years fourhour meeting attended by some 2000 
shareholders and another 250 demonstrators outside 
that meeting was held less than one month after the exxon valdez 
ran aground in prince william sound spilling 11 million gallons of 
crude in the nations worst oil spill 
altruism isnt the only factor motivating the shareholder 
proposals 
reducing toxic chemical emissions is in the best interests of 
exxon management and exxon shareholders not only from an 
environmental and community relations standpoint but from the 
financial and legal liability that toxic and pollutionrelated 
incidents could bring to the company and its shareholders says 
one proposal 
another resolution calls on exxon to create an environmental 
affairs committee of directors to show the companys highlevel 
concern in hopes of reducing any corporate liability 
other proposals would have exxon 
hold to its pledge to clean up prince william sound and show 
real leadership in dealing with the damage 
follow the valdez principles established by a coalition of 
institutional investors setting out corporate environmental goals 
and policies 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions 
exxon rejects the resolutions as duplicative and unnecessary 
the corporations longstanding policy is to adhere to all 
environmental health and safety laws and regulations that are 
applicable to its business exxon says in its proxy statement 
there also are four proposals involving shareholders rights or 
doing business in south africa or northern ireland 
generally i would like them to be responsible for their 
actions and to know there are shareholders who care more about 
integrity and responsibility than total profit said mrs 
chapman who wants exxon to report annually on all measurable 
hazardous emissions and include a hazardous risk assessment 
profit is important but it is not the beall and endall 
she said 
most of the proposals come from individuals however state 
pension funds from california massachusetts and new york city 
recently sought assurances from exxon that company would protect 
its earnings by taking steps to prevent another disaster like the 
valdez spill the funds holdings account for slightly more than 1 
percent of exxons outstanding shares 
the company on monday said net earnings for the first three 
months of this year fell 293 percent to 181 billion or 141 a 
share the decline reflected a big onetime gain from an 
accounting change in the first quarter of 1989 revenues rose 203 
percent to 267 billion from 222 billion 
exxons profit dropped 34 percent to 35 billion for all of 
1989 because of the 2 billion it spent on the valdez spill 
some environmentalists have accused exxon of meeting in houston 
in search of friendly ground and hoping to avoid some of last 
years demonstrators 
exxon officials deny that pointing out that exxons domestic 
subsidiary is based in houston and the city is home to many 
employees and shareholders previous meetings in houston drew 1300 
in 1986 and about 1200 in 1981 
criticism of exxon has continued since last years meeting 
especially after the company cut back cleanup efforts during the 
winter 
exxon also has been indicted on two felony charges and three 
misdemeanors stemming from the valdez spill has further blackened 
its image through numerous smaller spills and other accidents 
including a refinery explosion announced it was moving its 
headquarters from new york city to a dallas suburb and been the 
focus of numerous media reports of low morale in the executive 
suite

president bushs chief economic adviser 
says a peace dividend will help automakers and other 
manufacturers meet the high costs of cleanair legislation 
although they wont see the money directly 
michael j boskin chairman of the council of economic advisers 
said the administration is trying to quash some proposed cleanair 
requirements such as a severe clampdown on auto tailpipe 
emissions that it thinks would hurt the economy more than clear 
the air 
even so he said costs of pending cleanair legislation will 
top 20 billion a year nationally 
there will be job losses because of this bill and there will 
be some economic dislocation boskin said monday in an address to 
the economic club of detroit 
but the economy as a whole will be healthy he predicted 
while were keeping a wary eye on inflation to make sure we 
dont let the genie out of the bottle we do believe inflation 
will abate as we move forward in the next several months boskin 
said we also believe that over the course of the year it is 
likely that interest rates will abate 
interest rates would have eased sooner except for the dramatic 
changes in eastern europe and demand for capital to rebuild the 
former communist bloc countries boskin said 
the relaxing of political tension has let the administration 
budget for a reduction in military spending of 2 percent a year or 
a total of 10 percent over the next five years boskin said 
the top priority for those funds will be cutting the federal 
deficit he said 
the administration considers that the best way in the long run 
to help automakers and other manufacturers faced with big spending 
to meet pollution controls and improve productivity he said 
its a lot easier to do that if interest rates and the cost of 
capital are down boskin said a substantial reduction in the 
budget deficit will help accomplish that make it much more 
affordable for american industry to retool and upgrade and enhance 
its productivity

united airlines is counting on a wellknown 
chicago commodity political clout to help it fend off 
archrival american airlines in a battle for nonstop jet service 
from chicago to tokyo 
the us department of transportation is scheduled to start 
hearings today to pick six new ustojapan air routes 
on monday united boasted that its bid was supported by five 
state governors two state congressional delegations and the 
nebraska legislature all in the interest of better service for 
their constituents 
american countered that endorsements from politicians should not 
be important the dallasbased carrier says it should be awarded 
the route to preserve and nurture competition in the airline 
industry 
the contested route is between washingtons dulles international 
airport and tokyo with a stop at chicagos ohare international 
airport 
united said in a statement that its supporters had written to 
john j mathias a transportation department administrative law 
judge 
mathias will conduct hearings expected to result by oct 1 in 
the selection of six new us gateways for nonstop flights to 
japan 
a gateway is a departure point for a nonstop flight chicago 
would be the us gateway for the contested flight 
american has applied for a total of six different routes linking 
us and japanese cities said barry clark manager of americans 
international route strategy 
united spokesman joe hopkins said united is concentrating on 
only one route the tussle amounts to an allout effort by the 
hometown carrier to block american which recently pulled ahead of 
united as the nations biggest airline 
were putting all of our efforts into this one hopkins said 
united is based near chicago in elk grove village 
american a subsidiary of dallasbased amr corp exceeded 
united in sales and market share last year to become the biggest 
us carrier 
american has made ohare the hub for its extensive european 
connections and the airline has been advertising aggressively here 
in the past year trying to make a splash while the management of 
united was caught up in a battle for control of the carriers 
parent ual corp 
uals board recently agreed to sell the company to its employees 
for about 44 billion financing for the sale hasnt been arranged 
yet though 
united already is the leading transpacific carrier among us 
airlines which clark cited as a good reason for the government to 
award the chicagotokyo route to american 
in a situation like this clark said the dot should be 
looking for the maximum increase in competition which does not 
in our view support giving additional route authority in japan to 
the carrier that is already the biggest carrier between the united 
states and the far east 
as for uniteds political connections we obviously hope its 
not that terribly important clark said 
northwest airlines and japan air lines already fly between 
chicago and tokyo the airline officials said the proposed route 
would add another carrier and a washington connection 
supporting united are illinois gov james r thompson indiana 
gov evan bayh kentucky gov wallace g wilkinson nebraska gov 
kay a orr and virginia gov l douglas wilder 
other politicians backing uniteds bid include chicago mayor 
richard m daley the 24member illinois congressional delegation 
indianapolis mayor william h hudnut iii the nebraska legislature 
and the 12member virginia congressional delegation

martin shugrue jokes that he packed a magical irish 
shillelagh to help him conjure profits from eastern airlines 
he also brought a wealth of experience and a large dose of 
optimism as he began working toward the goal of bringing eastern 
out of bankruptcy protection 
he may need both wits and wizardry to turn around easterns 
chronic losses and embittered labor relations in the wake of a 
strike by unions that nearly grounded the carrier last year 
i believe eastern can achieve a financial turnaround 
shugrue who was appointed last week by us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland to take control of the miamibased carrier said 
monday the bedrock upon which a viable and profitable company 
can be built is already in place here 
shugrue would not dismiss the possibility that eastern might be 
sold eventually 
the immediate objective is to restore this airline to 
viability from there you obviously investigate other 
alternatives he said adding that several parties have already 
made initial inquiries about the carrier 
but he added i did not come here to liquidate this airline 
the man who replaced texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo at 
easterns helm previously served as president of easterns sister 
continental airlines a post he resigned under pressure in february 
1989 
shugrue described as holding the hottest seat in corporate 
america by one eastern official declined to give a timetable 
for a reorganization plan or a labor agreement with pilots or 
striking machinists 
he urged quick government approval of the proposed sale of 
easterns latin american routes to american airlines but he said 
he would review all other agreements including those involving 
computer reservation systems and a 285 million asset transfer 
settlement recently agreed to by texas air 
easterns chief labor negotiator thomas matthews resigned on 
saturday and will be replaced by alan c gibson a 25year eastern 
employee shugrue announced the resignation of eastern president 
phil bakes was announced on friday 
i dont expect any other imminent changes said shugrue 
talks have begun with machinists union leaders who have 
expressed a desire for a quick backtowork settlement but shugrue 
admitted that integrating strikers into the 18000employee work 
force may be impossible at current operation levels 
eastern has signed a backtowork pact with flight attendants 
and is negotiating with the air line pilots association both 
unions ended their sympathy walkouts in november 
eastern filed for chapter 11 protection five days after the 
strike began march 4 1989 
eastern spokesman robin matell said a new promotion aimed at 
business travelers should begin at the end of the month eastern 
which expects to lose 330 million this year has been operating 
between 65 percent and 70 percent capacity on its flights 
shugrue said he forsees eastern remaining close to its present 
size and retaining its atlanta hub any relocation of company 
headquarters from miami to atlanta is a lowpriority concern at 
this time he said

the united auto workers union says general motors 
corps plans to close a michigan truck plant and move its products 
to a new jersey plant now making cars is a game of musical 
chairs 
gm said monday it would close its pontiac west truck plant in 
1993 threatening the jobs of the plants 2300 workers 
uaw officials said they would work to find a vehicle for the 
plant north of detroit to keep its employees on the job 
its hard to see how greater efficiency and high worker morale 
can result from gms continuing game of musical chairs with the 
lives of our members and their families said stephen p yokich 
vice president in charge of the uaws gm department 
the giant automaker said it was moving production of its 
strucks called chevrolet blazer and gmc jimmy sportutility 
vehicles to its linden nj plant gms most popular car the 
chevrolet twodoor corsica and fourdoor beretta now are made 
there 
corsica and beretta production will be consolidated at 
wilmington del where they also are assembled now some tooling 
will be added later to gms car plant in lansing to enable it to 
make one of the two cars gm spokeswoman kari hulsey said 
corsica and beretta sales are third behind the honda accord and 
ford taurus through march 31 of this year 
the linden plant will be shut down for about six months to 
retool for a redesigned struck hulsey said she didnt know if the 
blazer and jimmy names would be retained 
hulsey said the linden plant has about 25 million square feet 
of assembly space and the pontiac factory had about 18 million 
auto industry observers have speculated that although 
sportutility sales are running flat this year the market segment 
will grow as the number of fourdoor versions of the vehicles 
increases 
pontiac west will continue operating as usual while the linden 
plant along with gms moraine ohio and shreveport la plants 
are prepared for production of the redesigned truck she said 
moraine and shreveport now make strucks 
the cost of renovating the plants for the new truck was not 
available hulsey said employment at the linden plant was recently 
cut in half by the elimination of one of two shifts leaving it 
with about 1800 hourly and 300 salaried employees hulsey said 
when truck production reaches full steam in linden hulsey said 
gm plans to return to two shifts with a total of about 2500 hourly 
workers 
guy messina shop chairman of uaw local 595 in linden praised 
the announcement of increased employment we have produced 
employment and security for our members and thats what its all 
about he said 
when the shift is complete it will leave the city of pontiac 
with one plant making fullsize pickups as recently as 1987 gm 
operated four assembly plants making three kinds of trucks and a 
car in pontiac about 25 miles north of detroit 
pontiac mayor wallace holland was in meetings and was 
unavailable for comment said a woman who answered his office phone 
the current contract between gm and the uaw allows the 
shuttering of a plant only when sales of its products slump but 
the pontiac west plant will close after the current agreement 
expires sept 14 so it doesnt fall under the restriction 
since 1987 when the current gmuaw contract became effective 
the automaker has closed or announced plans to close five plants in 
as many states putting more than 14000 people out of work 
chrysler corp closed a plant in detroit in february and plans 
to close one in missouri later this year affecting about 5600 
workers 
ford motor co has closed no plants during the current uaw 
contract

a texaco attorney says he would have challenged 
the qualifications of a judge that approved an 11 billion judgment 
against texaco if hed known the judge had worked for the opponent 
a few months earlier 
texas lawyer a legal trade publication reported monday that 
retired state district judge solomon casseb jr was paid 25000 by 
one of pennzoil cos law firms for work on a case unrelated to the 
1985 fight between pennzoil and texaco inc 
the payment which casseb received while working in a private 
practice was not disclosed to either side during the trial 
casseb awarded pennzoil 111 billion during an appeal texaco 
and pennzoil later settled the case out of court for 3 billion 
legal experts quoted by texas lawyer said the payment to casseb 
should have been disclosed although it did not violate ethical 
canons 
surely there must be a judge who could be appointed to 
complete this case who had not just finished a very substantial 
relationship with one of the lead counsel on the other side 
texaco attorney richard miller said monday by telephone from his 
houston office 
william barnett managing partner for pennzoils law firm baker 
amp botts told the associated press none of the attorneys working on 
the case were aware of the payment barnett said the payment on 
feb 14 1985 was made on behalf of a client in another case 
theres no way anyone could have forecast casseb would be 
appointed to the texacopennzoil case barnett said from houston 
casseb a retired judge and attorney in san antonio did not 
grant an interview to texas lawyer and did not return telephone 
calls from the associated press 
pennzoil sued texaco in 1984 claiming it illegally interfered 
in a planned merger between pennzoil and getty oil co when texaco 
itself acquired getty 
eight weeks into the trial judge anthony jp harris stepped 
down citing poor health on oct 22 1985 administrative judge 
thomas stovall appointed casseb to take over the case 
casseb had served as a judge until 1968 when he returned to 
private practice texas lawyer said he qualified as a retired 
judge agreeing to sit as a visiting judge anywhere in texas in 
may 1985 
in november 1985 a jury awarded pennzoil 1053 billion and 
casseb approved the verdict with interest the total judgment was 
111 billion 
an appeals court later reduced the punitive damages and in 1987 
when texaco lost attempts to avoid posting 10 billion bond the 
company filed for federal bankruptcy court protection 
in december 1987 texaco and pennzoil agreed to settle the case 
for 3 billion

bat industries plc says it will press ahead with 
its massive asset sales program even though sir james goldsmith has 
dropped his hostile 22 billion takeover bid for the british 
conglomerate 
bat drew up the restructuring plan hoping to boost its stock 
price and fight off the anglofrench financiers allpaper bid of 
878 pence a share or the equivalent of 1431 
the plan calls for bat to sell its retailing and paper 
businesses including saks fifth avenue and the justsold marshall 
fields in order to concentrate on tobacco and financial 
services it also includes the repurchase by the company of up to 
10 percent of its stock 
goldsmiths withdrawal announced after the stock market closed 
monday and blamed on regulatory frustrations involving bats us 
insurance subsidiary was expected to depress bats share price 
the shares fell 24 pence or around 39 cents to 700 pence or 
1141 on londons stock exchange at midday today the news of the 
withdrawal came after mondays close 
its obviously going to be a little bit unsettled in the 
shortterm said jack jones an analyst with the brokerage ubs 
philips and drew 
but kishore bangor an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
in london said investors would turn their attention to bats 
fundamentals and the stock would look relatively cheap 
the offer by goldsmiths hoylake investments ltd would have 
been the worlds secondlargest takeover after kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp cos 25 billion purchase of rjr nabisco inc completed 
early last year 
hoylake launched the offer in july then suspended it in 
september while it sought regulatory approval 
two weeks ago californias insurance regulators decided to bar 
a change of control of bats farmers insurance group inc of los 
angeles the offer needed approval from the commissioners of a 
total of nine states where farmers operates 
hoylake abandoned its bid because of delays caused by the us 
regulatory process said a london source close to the company 
we have always felt we could achieve a favorable position but 
it could take quite a while said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity we didnt feel it was in the best 
interests of the shareholders given the uncertainties 
hoylake had planned to sell farmers for 45 billion to the 
french insurance group axamidi assurances axamidi announced in 
paris monday that it has dropped its bid 
bat chairman patrick sheehy welcomed hoylakes withdrawal in a 
statement shareholders gave overwhelming support to our 
reshaping proposals last october he said referring to a 
shareholder vote backing the restructuring plan 
todays overdue decision by hoylake does not alter our resolve 
to see that program through to its completion and to continue to 
maximize value for our shareholders 
last week bat announced the sale of its us retailer marshall 
fields to dayton hudson corp for 104 billion the company also 
has put saks fifth avenue on the auction block 
goldsmith and other shareholders have complained that bats 
stock price does not reflect its value because it is dragged down 
by the slower growth of the tobacco businesses which include brown 
amp williamson in the united states 
goldsmith and his hoylake partners who included british 
merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian businessman kerry 
packer had wanted to unbundle bat by selling off all its 
nontobacco operations 
in its statement monday hoylake said the directors of hoylake 
wish bat and its unbundled offspring great success within their new 
structures

general motors corp must continue to defend a 
nationwide suit by some owners seeking damages for defects in 
diesel engines after their warranties expired the us supreme 
court decided 
the court refused monday to review a 4th us circuit court of 
appeals ruling that consumers can be protected beyond time limits 
set by the manufacturer by an implied warranty that a product 
is fit for its ordinary purpose 
gm lawyers charged that the lower courts august 1989 ruling 
will have intolerable consequences for manufacturers of consumer 
products throughout the united states 
gm and the motor vehicle manufacturers association said the 
ruling could trigger a wave of lawsuits by anyone who suffered 
repair costs at any time and could extend to all consumer 
transactions 
lawyers for consumers said gms arguments were exaggerated 
the supreme court let stand the appeals courts ruling that gm 
must defend against a suit by 600000 owners of 198185 cars and 
trucks with 57liter diesel engines who made claims for defects 
after their warranties expired 
gms warranties covered the engines for two years or 24000 
miles for 198182 models and three years or 50000 miles for 
198385 models 
lawyers for the vehicle owners charge gm knew but didnt 
disclose that its diesel engines would fail prematurely

wages salaries and other benefits paid to 
american workers shot up 55 percent over the past year the 
largest jump in six years the government reported today 
the labor department attributed much of the increase in its 
employment cost index one of the best measures of wage inflation 
to the continued soaring cost of health insurance and other 
benefits 
health insurance alone increased 121 percent for the year 
ending in march following the 134 percent rise registered for the 
12month period ending in march 1989 
the 55 percent rise in overall employment costs was the largest 
12month surge since march 1984 when wages benefits and salaries 
increased by 59 percent the government said a year ago 
employment costs had gone up 48 percent for the same period 
economists have been concerned that tight labor markets are 
pushing labor costs higher and worsening the nations inflation 
problems last month the nations already relatively low 
unemployment rate fell a notch to 52 percent 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co called the 
report a big negative on the inflation outlook 
it shows that we have a rock hard high employment cost lump 
facing american business that is being passed on at the retail 
level sinai said 
todays report showed that wages and salaries rose 42 percent 
over the year ending in march the same as the increase from a year 
earlier while benefit costs jumped 72 percent compared with a 
54 percent rise a year before 
the jump in benefit costs was blamed on higher health insurance 
and an increase in social security taxes up from 751 percent to 
765 percent 
workers in the service sector of the economy fared slightly 
better than the manufacturing sector in pay gains service 
industries saw wages and salaries go up by 42 percent in the past 
12 months compared to a 40 percent rise for the manufacturing 
sector 
the gain reflects the fact that service industries have been 
more affected by shortages of workers in the past year 
however there was a wide split in pay gains in the services 
category at the low end wages in food stores and banking rose 
just 28 percent while wages at hospitals and health care clinics 
shot up 63 percent 
nonunion workers continued on a sixyear pattern of gaining 
better wage and salary advances than their union counterparts over 
the past 12 months wages and salaries rose 44 percent for 
nonunion workers while increasing 34 percent for union workers 
with benefits included compensation costs rose 54 percent for 
nonunion workers while increasing 43 percent for those in unions 
state and local government workers gained 56 percent increases 
in wages and salaries over the past year compared with the 47 
percent increases gained a year ago health services workers 
received the highest increases 67 percent 
private industry workers in the northeast fared the best in 
terms of wage and salary gains workers in that region saw their 
wages and salaries increase by 54 percent compared with a 35 
percent rise for workers in the midwest and a 34 percent gain for 
those in the west southern workers enjoyed gains of 43 percent

contracts settled through collective 
bargaining in the first three months of 1990 gave workers average 
annual wage increases of 33 percent over the life of the pacts 
the government reported today 
the last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated 
usually in 1987 or 1988 average wage gains were smaller averaging 
22 percent over the contract term the labor department said 
part of the gains reflect wage increases where there had been 
cuts or freezes in previous agreements such as in the steel 
industry the department said 
in addition wage gains were larger than pay raises negotiated 
in previous agreements particularly in petroleum refining and food 
stores the government said 
for the 12month period ending in march settlements that were 
reached provided wage adjustments averaging 34 percent a year over 
the contract life compared with 23 percent when the same parties 
previously bargained 
the average annual wage gains over the contract life has been 
increasing since the low of 17 percent for a 12month period 
which occurred for the year ending in september 1986 
the collective bargaining report like the labor departments 
broader employment cost index that also was released today showed 
workers in the fastgrowing service sector winning larger wage 
gains than manufacturing workers service workers received an 
average annual gain of 34 percent over the contract life while 
manufacturing workers received an average boost of 32 percent 
the average construction worker received gains of 38 percent a 
year over the life of the contract the report said 
the labor department said the 74 collective bargaining 
agreements it analyzed covered about 318000 workers the 
government tracks agreements covering bargaining units with at 
least 1000 workers 
the government said 186 such agreements covering about 590000 
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations 
during the apriljune 1990 period with many of those jobs in the 
construction industry 
in addition there are about 695000 workers under 111 contracts 
that had expired or been reopened but not renegotiated or 
ratified prior to the end of march more than half those workers 
are railroad employees

dow chemical co reported tuesday that its 
firstquarter profit fell 38 percent over a year ago as rising 
material costs and sagging prices of some products offset an 
increase in sales

share in 1989 
quarterly sales rose 9 percent to 490 billion from 449 
billion 
chief executive officer frank popoff attributed the lower profit 
partly to a drop prices in some ethylenebased products and to 
higher feedstock costs 
but he remained optimistic about the rest of the year 
as we enter the second quarter feedstock costs are declining 
and prices for several largevolume products are increasing 
popoff said in a statement our valueadded businesses continue 
to show sales and earnings growth and provide a solid profit base

monsanto co reported tuesday that its 
firstquarter profit fell 13 percent from last year because of soft 
conditions in the automotive industry and a seasonal slowdown in 
agriculture 
for the quarter ended march 31 the chemical and agricultural 
products giant had a profit of 194 million or 295 a share down 
from a record 222 million or 324 a share earnings in 1989 
sales for the quarter were flat 228 billion compared with 
last years 226 billion 
chairman richard mahoney said despite the fact that earnings 
were below those of last years record first quarter were 
confident about the prospects for the rest of the year we expect 
to make 1990 another record year for monsanto 
monsanto produces a wide variety of chemicals including 
compounds that are used in automobile dashboards windshields and 
tires the company also manufactures pesticides and animal feed 
supplements 
mahoney said earnings from agricultural chemicals fell in the 
first quarter because farmers were either waiting to buy some 
chemicals in bulk or were choosing lowerpriced formulations 
monsantos chemical segment had slightly lower operating 
profits but considering that the automotive industry was soft 
mahoney said the segment performed well 
we think the worst is behind us in these auto markets he 
said 
monsantos drug subsidiary gd searle showed a 4 million 
profit compared with an 8 million loss in the first quarter of 
1989 and the nutrasweet co which is also owned by monsanto had 
slightly lower profits because of the cost of introducing its new 
frozen dairy dessert simple pleasures

the chairman of the senate budget committee 
said today that congress must craft its own 1991 budget because the 
bush administration isnt giving it serious attention 
sen james sasser dtenn told the committee that he hoped to 
draft a 12 trillion budget by having members consider at least 
three alternatives with deficit reduction ranging from 50 billion 
down to 37 billion 
sen pete domenici of new mexico the senior republican on the 
panel promised to cooperate but said he didnt think sassers 
strategy would work 
the missing link is the president of the united states he 
said 
but sasser said at this point at least the administration 
isnt serious about the budget 
i have very severe doubts that negotiations with the white 
house are the way to go he said 
before todays meeting sasser had worked for weeks without 
success to find a consensus among the 10 republicans and 13 
democrats on the committee for a deficitreduction plan 
domenici contended today that having congress adopt a budget on 
its own almost certainly supported only by the majority democrats 
dooms the resolution to either a partisan piece of paper or an 
inoperative document 
two of the panels democrats sens ernest hollings of south 
carolina and charles robb of virginia also appear unhappy saying 
deeper cuts are needed their defections would leave sasser one 
vote shy of being able to send a measure to the full senate 
despite this sasser expressed confidence that the committee 
would eventually approve a budget perhaps by weeks end 
i cant believe that members of the majority will want to sit 
around and let grammrudman necessitate cuts which is what would 
occur unless we go about our business here he said 
the grammrudman deficitreduction law sets a target of a 64 
billion shortfall for fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 under 
current projections that would mean that at least 37 billion in 
savings must be found if they are not the law automatically 
triggers spending cuts in many government programs 
white house budget director richard darman said last week that 
because of the economys poor recent performance the amount of 
deficitreduction needed to satisfy grammrudman now ranges from 
45 billion to 57 billion or more 
all of sassers proposals would shift some of the money bush 
wants to spend on defense to domestic programs 
sasser favors limiting next years defense spending to 292 
billion 15 billion below the amount needed to stay even with 
inflation and 4 billion below spending this year bush has 
proposed 304 billion for the military 
the plans sasser put forward provide defense expenditures 
ranging from 287 billion to 292 billion they each rely on 139 
billion in new tax receipts the same amount bush has requested 
they vary in the amount of savings that would come from domestic 
program cuts and new fees from 83 billion to 161 billion 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee proposed last week that defense spending be limited to 
about 297 billion 
last thursday the house budget committee approved a budget that 
would hold military spending to 295 billion that 
democraticwritten spending plan approved on a strict partyline 
vote could go to the house floor by wednesday

year the data gave support to the idea of a strong economy one of 
the bond markets current fears

the city council has unanimously rejected a 
proposed 20centsapack cigarette tax in this city where tobacco 
giant philip morris companies inc is the largest private employer 
i felt it was not appropriate for the city of richmond to do 
this because tobacco has been a major industry since the citys 
beginning said mayor geline b williams who introduced the 
proposal that effectively killed the tax 
the tax which was defeated monday night would have raised 32 
million it was one of several proposals in city manager robert c 
bobbs proposed 199091 budget aimed at shifting the tax burden 
from property owners to consumers 
twentynine localities in the state impose a cigarette tax but 
richmond was viewed by cigarette manufacturers as a place where 
they needed to prevail 
new yorkbased philip morris employs 11000 people at a 
cigarette manufacturing plant here 
tobacco industry representatives argued that the tax would 
generate far less revenue than predicted because consumers would 
leave the city to buy cigarettes elsewhere 
bill daunhauer of the bakery confectionary and tobacco workers 
international union aflcio said tobacco company employees give 
more than 1 million a year to the local united way campaign 
exclusive of corporate gifts 
it would seem an injustice to these workers for the city to 
pass any legislation that may cost them their livelihood he said 
anne morrow donley executive director of the virginia group to 
alleviate smoking in public said the nonsmoking majority of 
richmonders have to subsidize the industry through increased 
insurance rates and tax rates 
until the tobacco industry is willing or required to make 
reparations for the harm their products cause it makes sense to 
require those who use the product to bear the cost of it to 
society she said 
the council directed bobb to find a way other than the cigarette 
tax to raise the money

here are excerpts from a statement made by 
exdrexel burnham lambert inc financier michael milken in 
manhattan federal court tuesday when he pleaded guilty to six 
felonies in the biggest securities fraud settlement against an 
individual in history 
i was the founder and head of the high yield and convertible 
securities department at drexel in pioneering the creation of new 
instruments for the financing of companies most of which did not 
have access to the capital markets because they did not have 
investmentgrade ratings and in making markets in such securities 
we operated under unique highly demanding and intensely 
competitive conditions but i do not cite these conditions as an 
excuse for not conforming to all of the laws that governed our 
highly regulated business i am here today because in connection 
with some transactions i transgressed certain of the laws and 
regulations that govern our industry i was wrong in doing so and 
knew that at the time and i am pleading guilty to these offenses 
one of the accounts we did business with was the ivan boesky 
organization which also did business with many other firms drexel 
did some financings for and trading with the boesky firm but 
drexels business with the boesky organization never approached one 
percent of the business of our department he traded in stocks i 
traded primarily in bonds or their equivalent but because he was 
a major factor in the securities markets he had the potential to 
become a more significant account we were not social friends and 
had little in common the relationship started as an arms length 
and correct one unfortunately however certain of our 
transactions involved reciprocal accommodations some of which 
violated the law 
because of the tremendous amount of publicity that has 
surrounded this case i wish to make clear that my plea is an 
acceptance of personal responsibility for my own failings and 
actions and not a reflection on the underlying soundness and 
integrity of the segment of the capital markets in which we 
specialized and which provided capital that enabled hundreds of 
companies to survive expand and flourish our business was in no 
way dependent on these practices nor did they comprise a 
fundamental part of our business and i regret them very much 
this investigation and proceeding are now in their fourth 
year this long period has been extremely painful and difficult for 
my family and friends as well as myself i realize that by my acts 
i have hurt those who are closest to me i am truly sorry i thank 
the court for permitting me to add this apology and for its 
fairness in handling this complex case

lower interest rates the bond market gained despite a government 
report showing a strongerthanexpected 67 percent rise in durable 
goods orders in march

junkbond pioneer michael milkens cathartic 
guilty plea to securities fraud today provoked reactions ranging 
from sympathy by defense lawyers to scornful snubs on wall street 
where many say his prolonged bout with the law helped taint the 
integrity of the financial markets 
the milken case was like a cleansing process that should 
restore investor confidence said john eric smith a floor 
official at the new york stock exchange when word broke of 
milkens tearful admission to six felony counts in a packed 
manhattan federal court 
the 43yearold former head bond trader for nowbankrupt drexel 
burnham lambert which revolutionized the securities industry with 
the use of highyield junk bonds that financed the takeover 
boom of the 1980s had insisted he was innocent for more than three 
years before changing his mind 
most of the counts to which he pleaded guilty were related to 
drexels relationship with speculator ivan boesky the convicted 
felon who provided much of the information for prosecutions of wall 
street corruption in recent years 
it was boeskys revelations about insider trading and other 
crimes that helped humble drexel and eventually drive it into 
bankruptcy court earlier this year putting 10000 people out of 
work 
milken faces a maximum 28 year prison term and must forfeit 600 
million in fines and restitution to defrauded investors but it 
will still leave him one of the nations wealthiest individuals 
i dont think well have to pass the hat for the guy you know 
what i mean said a middleaged nyse worker queried in lower 
manhattans financial district he declined to identify himself by 
name 
lawyers familiar with the milken case speculated the hardest 
thing for him to do was stand up in open court and admit he was a 
felon after insisting he was innocent for so long 
i think it was a fairly tragic and humbling proceeding for 
milken said theodore wells a lawyer who has represented other 
white collar defendants in fallout from the boeskydrexel scandal 
hopefully people will remember all of the good that he did for 
the financial markets and not focus exclusively on these apparent 
aberrations 
some said the charges in the plea agreement drastically fewer 
and less serious than the 98count racketeeringfraud indictment 
milken faced had he not pleaded guilty did not mean the government 
had let him off easily many believe milken will have to do some 
prison time 
whether its six counts or 26 counts it doesnt make a 
difference in the end and the message is the same said paul 
fischer a securities law attorney in washington and former 
securities and exchange lawyer who helped develop the investigation 
that eventually led to prosecutions of boesky drexel and milken 
six felony counts are six felony counts the exposure he has 
is still 28 years said ira l sorkin a former sec administrator 
in new york who now is in private practice 
its silly to play the game of who got the better deal 
sorkin said the fact of the matter is mr milken is a convicted 
felon federal prison minimum or maximum is not a very pleasant 
place

hitachi ltd is believed to be the first 
japanese company operating a research lab at an american university 
now that it has opened a biotechnology center at the university of 
california here 
hitachi officials said monday they hope the 165 million 
laboratory called plumwood house because of its plum color will 
allow the company to advance in areas like neuroscience and 
biochemistry where it has traditionally been weak 
hitachi has been devoting research in recent years to 
biotechnology but we are not advanced in this area said hiroshi 
sumiyama who heads the lab 
thats why the company decided to locate the facility in the 
united states which is more advanced in biotechnology research 
uci gave us the opportunity to do this he said 
uci leased 1 acres to hitachi for 40 years in return uci 
researchers can use 15000 of the 40000squarefoot building 
called plumwood house 
the university is getting great laboratory space at no expense 
to the taxpayers said john wasmuth one of three uci researchers 
assigned to the lab 
the lab will be used by 60 hitachi and uci researchers 
state officials noted the venture will benefit both the 
university and hitachi while any discoveries by lab researchers 
will go to uci 
its not going to succeed if the general public does not 
benefit before hitachi said allan melkesian director of the 
state office of foreign investment there is going to be a lot of 
scrutiny as there ought to be it is a sensitive area 
foreign investment on college campuses is not new a consortium 
of german companies built a computer science building at the 
university of california berkeley campus and a japanese 
pharmaceutical company is constructing a lab at the uc san diego 
campus 
four us corporations including texas instruments have 
established laboratories at japanese institutions 
another japanese electronics giant nec corp plans to open an 
artificial intelligence laboratory in princeton nj next month 
nec is spending 75 million for the project and company officials 
say they intend to recruit researchers from princeton university 
joint ventures between japanese companies and american 
universities are likely to grow according to richard king a los 
angelesbased international trade consultant 
i think we will find many more of these kinds of ventures 
where the japanese want to tie in with research and development and 
hightechnology endeavors and the universities welcome that 
because its a privatepublic sector relationship where benefits 
accrue to both sides king said

stock prices fell today for the fifthstraight 
session as a late round of computertriggered selling wiped out 
initial gains 
the market advanced on the opening boosted by rising bond 
prices stocks appeared to mirror the seesawing of the credit 
market for much of the session and struggled to hold on to gains 
once bonds came under pressure 
government bonds yielding close to 9 percent proved an 
attractive alternative to equities but some analysts noted that 
with a substantial amount of cash on the sidelines investors were 
not forced to sell stocks to buy bonds 
trading was moderate 
alfred e goldman a vice president at ag edwards amp sons inc 
in st louis called the markets performance a little 
disappointing because it tried to go up both the generals and the 
troops 
he was encouraged that although bond prices fell they were down 
only fractionally and the market seemed to be stabilizing 
stocks recently have been taking their cue from bond prices 
which fall when interst rates rise higher interest rates lower 
stock valuations and make corporate borrowing more expensive

junk bond giant michael milken tearfully pleaded 
guilty today to six criminal charges and agreed to pay 600 million 
to settle the biggest wall street fraud case ever against an 
individual 
i realize by my acts i have hurt those who are closest to me 
i am truly sorry milken said breaking down and crying as he 
read a statement in court 
included were guilty pleas for aiding speculator ivan boesky in 
several securities law violations for aiding another trader in 
filing false income tax returns and for conspiring to violate 
securities laws 
milken did not plead to any charges of insider trading or 
racketeering which were the most serious in the governments 
original broad indictment of him 
sentencing was set for oct 1 milken faces a possible maximum 
total of up to 28 years in prison 
milken 43 entered his guilty plea at 1242 pm before us 
district judge kimba wood in a courtroom packed with about 250 
people in lower manhattan 
the move capped the stunning decline of the former head of 
drexel burnham lambert incs highyield bond department who 
gained notoriety for engineering financing for some of the biggest 
corporate takeovers of the 1980s and then for allegations of 
widespread wrongdoing 
milken was the main target of the governments lengthy 
investigation of wall street crime that resulted in more than 30 
convictions and he was the last to fall 
milken was linked to a large insider trading network headed by 
boesky who paid 100 million and was sentenced to three years in 
prison in exchange for providing information against milken drexel 
and others 
after three years of rumors and press leaks the justice 
department in march 1989 indicted milken his brother lowell and 
former drexel trader bruce newberg on an unprecedented 98 counts of 
fraud and racketeering 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under the plea deal all charges were dropped against lowell 
milken a lawyer and key aide to his brother at drexel the case 
against newberg was not resolved 
after the hearing lowell milken issued a statement repeating 
his claim of innocence and calling it one of the saddest and most 
frustrating days of my life 
the pain inflicted on our families cannot be undone i am 
proud of my brother and nothing that has happened here today has 
changed that the statement read 
michael milken pleaded guilty to counts of conspiracy aiding 
and abetting failure to meet federal securities disclosure 
regulations securities fraud aiding and abetting a regulated 
brokerdealer to violate securities reporting requirements mail 
fraud and assisting in filing a false tax return 
the first five counts carry a maximum five years each in prison 
and the tax count has a maximum three year setnence for a possible 
total of 28 years 
milken agreed to pay 200 million in penalties to the government 
and 400 million to set up a fund for reimbursing investors 
defrauded by his actions 
we believe that this prosecution and the fact that mr milken 
has admitted to guilt will send the right message to the financial 
community assistant us attorney john k carroll told the 
court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
richard breeden chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission told a news conference in washington mr milken has 
been portrayed as wrongly accused and as having simply devoted 
himself to the financing of small or emerging business despite the 
efforts to mold public opinion mr milkens admissions today 
demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of 
manipulation fraud and deceit 
milken wearing a blue suit white shirt and blue polkadot tie 
read a lengthy statement detailing the crimes that he pleaded 
guilty to he summarized his work as head of drexels highyield 
bond department which helped reshape corporate america by 
pioneering the wide use of its socalled junk bonds to raise 
money for small companies and finance corporate takeovers 
the original indictment had charged the defendants with illegal 
securities trading stock manipulation and other fraudulent 
activity some in connection with a series of corporate mergers and 
acquisitions 
milken had pleaded innocent and repeatedly said he would fight 
the charges at trial but reversed his position after months of 
negotiations between the government and his attorneys 
he had faced a much longer prison term and possible forfeiture 
of his wealth said to be more than 1 billion under the original 
charges 
the plea deal was reached friday after the us attorneys 
office said it would bring a broader indictment as it had been 
threatening to do for nearly a year if milken did not settle 
milken told the court he violated the law in doing business with 
boesky in 1984 when boesky acquired more than 10 percent of the 
stock of fischbach corp a takeover target at the time 
as part of his dealings milken told boesky that drexel would 
cover any losses boesky suffered in trading the stock in violation 
of federal disclosure requirements 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
milken also admitted to securities fraud in an arrangement with 
boesky involving the sale of mca inc stock by drexel client golden 
nugget inc in the fall of 1984 
in the taxrelated count milken said he helped drexel client 
david solomon head of solomon asset management engage in illegal 
trading and create fictitious losses for tax purposes 
milken broke down as he finished his statement his attorney 
arthur liman placed his hand on his back for support as milken 
finished reading 
milken is required to answer questions about the governments 
continuing insider trading and savings and loan investigations but 
he does not have to provide specific information to help develop 
other fraud cases 
he will not be questioned until after sentencing limiting the 
governments control over the impact of his cooperation 
after his indictment milken set aside about 700 million to 
guarantee payment in the event of conviction it was unclear 
whether that money would be used to pay the new penalties 
milken the son of an accountant is widely regarded as the 
nations most important financial figure since jp morgan 
dominated the banking and securities industries in the early 1900s 
milken is credited with reshaping american finance in the 1980s 
through junk bonds used to provide billions of dollars in capital 
to small and mediumsized companies and to finance hostile 
corporate takeovers 
junk bonds grew from an obscure form of debt to a 200 billion 
market almost entirely because of milken who controlled a wide 
network of buyers and sellers and wielded enormous power 
under an agreement with drexel milken was paid more than 11 
billion from 198387 including 550 million in 1987 alone 
milken drexel and others were accused by the securities and 
exchange commission in september 1988 with sweeping civil insider 
trading charges 
drexel settled its case last year by pleading guilty to six 
felonies and agreeing to pay 650 million in fines and restitution 
drexel was required to sever ties with milken who quit last june 
after 19 years at drexel 
drexel itself collapsed and is liquidating after its parent 
company defaulted on debt payments and filed for bankruptcy court 
protection in february

four major corporations and a computer software 
company said tuesday they formed an alliance to develop software 
that will allow them to better manage corporate knowledge or 
the skills and knowhow of their employees 
the five companies digital equipment corp ford motor co 
texas instruments inc u s west inc and carnegie group inc a 
pittsburghbased software company said they contributed 10 
million to the initiative which they began in 1988 but did not 
announce at the time 
the alliance called the initiative for managing knowledge 
assets is aimed at developing a nextgeneration software that will 
capture the skills and knowledge of a companys employees and make 
it available to others through a computer system 
the ability to manage these assets just as companies manage 
their capital or financial assets is one of the most important 
ways in which companies can retain a competitive advantage in our 
increasingly competitive world said ted smith technical 
director of u s west advanced technologies inc a division of the

the group calls the computer technique it intends to develop 
knowledge processing 
the five companies said they will use the software they develop 
in their own operations and sell products based on it smith 
invited other companies to join the nonprofit group 
smith said the companies hope the software they develop will 
help them bring products to market faster and improve customer

development of the software it said 
the group said it will use concepts developed in artificial 
intelligence research such as expert systems programs but that 
the software will not be an artificial intelligence application per 
se 
artificial intelligence is a type of software than attempts to 
mimic the way humans think expert systems programs attempt to 
capture the knowledge of a human expert such as an engineer or 
doctor and make it available through a programming technique 
called inference in which conclusions are drawn about a problem or 
question through a series of logic questions such as ifthen 
clauses 
the companies said they decided to form the group after they 
found nothing on the market to provide the type of computer program 
they need

for testing by this fall 
michael l schneider a computer analyst at the research firm 
gartner group inc said the alliance represents the first time a 
group of endusers of computer services has decided to set the 
standards for a new computer technology at its infancy 
currently he said expertsystems programs are not 
standardized under the software the group intends to develop it

michael milken the billionaire financier who 
reshaped wall street in the 1980s but fell in its biggest scandal 
pleaded guilty tuesday to breaking federal securities and tax laws 
and agreed to pay a record 600 million in penalties 
milken 43 broke down and sobbed before the packed manhattan 
courtroom as he finished a lengthy statement outlining his crimes 
which included illegal trading with stock speculator ivan boesky 
and others from 198486 
i realize by my acts i have hurt those who are closest to me 
i am truly sorry milken said he had to be supported by his 
attorney and his voice cracked when he pleaded guilty your 
honor 
milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison at his scheduled oct 
1 sentencing before us district judge kimba wood although legal 
experts expect a term of around five years 
the plea marked a stunning victory in the governments crackdown 
on wall street crime that has included more than 30 convictions and 
targeted milken and his former employer drexel burnham lambert 
inc from its outset in 1986 
milken widely is regarded as the most important american 
financier since jp morgan jr in the early 1900s and he came to 
symbolize the bounty and excesses of a booming wall street his 
personal fortune is said to exceed 1 billion 
milken pioneered the use of highyield debt securities known as 
junk bonds that gave small companies access to billions of dollars 
in capital and also made possible the wave of hostile corporate 
takeovers that characterized the dogeatdog 1980s 
but his downfall began after he was linked to an insider trading 
network by boesky who received a threeyear prison term and was 
fined 100 million in november 1986 to settle his own case 
milken was indicted on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering in 
march 1989 but vigorously maintained his innocence he reversed 
course last week and agreed to the plea bargain avoiding a long 
costly trial and the prospect of a much stiffer prison term 
richard breeden chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission said in washington that milkens admissions 
demonstrate that he stood at the center of a network of 
manipulation fraud and deceit 
milken pleaded guilty to conspiracy securities fraud mail 
fraud helping others violate federal securities regulations and 
assisting in the filing of a false tax return 
far less severe than the original indictment the counts do not 
involve rackteering or unlawful securities trading based on inside 
information the racketeering charge carried a minimum 20year 
prison term and possible forfeiture of milkens wealth 
the charges are a far cry from the lurid irresponsible and 
prejudicial accusations against michael that have been made by 
anonymous sources to the press for the past 3 years milken 
attorney arthur liman said after the plea 
it is michaels hope that history will see his violations 
in context and judge him not just on the basis of his lapses but on 
the basis of the contributions that he made to the economy and to 
the american people he said 
under the settlement milken agreed to pay 200 million in fines 
to the justice department and to 400 million for a civil fund for 
reimbursing investors defrauded by his actions the penalties are 
the largest against an individual in us history 
the government dropped all charges against milkens brother 
lowell who was named in the indictment the status of former 
drexel trader bruce newberg also part of the original case was 
not yet resolved 
milken also is required to cooperate with the government after 
his sentencing the deal settles civil sec charges and bars milken 
permanently from the securities industry 
we believe that this prosecution and the fact that mr milken 
has admitted to guilt will send the right message to the financial 
community assistant us attorney john k carroll told the court 
carroll said that after sentencing is completed the public 
should conclude that justice has been done 
milken wearing a blue suit white shirt and blue polkadot tie 
was composed as he described the work of drexels beverly hills 
califbased junk bond department and his unlawful actions he 
broke down in discussing his personal struggle during the fouryear 
investigation 
in addition to conspiracy milken admitted to 
violating federal disclosure requirements by failing to record 
a deal compensating boesky for trading losses in fischbach corp in 
1984 boesky had acquired more than 10 percent of the takeover 
target on milkens recommendation and milken promised to to cover 
any trading losses 
securities fraud involving the sale of mca inc stock by drexel 
client golden nugget inc in the fall of 1984 milken said he 
arranged illegal trades to cover losses by boesky who agreed to 
buy blocks of mca stock to mask sales of large positions and create 
the appearance of market demand 
violating federal net capital standards by forcing drexel to 
buy more than 1 million shares in helmerich amp payne corp in early 
1985 from boeskys firm which agreed to buy back the stock at a 
later date the transactions were not recorded on the books of 
boeskys seemala corp 
milken said he was not involved in buying the stock but learned 
of it later and approved the deal 
illegal securities trading with drexel client david solomon 
head of solomon asset management to recoup some commissions paid 
by drexel to a fund managed by solomon in 1985 and 1986 
creating shortterm capital losses through a series of bond 
transactions in american adventure inc and patient technology inc 
to benefit solomons personal income tax liability 
milken said his plea was an admission of personal responsibility 
and not a reflection of the underlying soundness and integrity of 
the capital markets in which we specialized 
our business was in no way dependent on these practices he 
said nor did they comprise a fundamental part of our business 
and i regret them very much 
junk bonds grew from an obscure form of debt to a 200 billion 
market almost entirely because of milken who controlled a wide 
network of buyers and sellers and wielded enormous power 
the market virtually dried up last fall because of problems 
involving several large defaults and milkens departure from the 
scene 
drexel settled related civil and criminal charges last year by 
pleading guilty to six felonies and agreeing to pay 650 million in 
fines and restitution milken quit drexel last june after 19 years 
to form his own consulting firm 
drexel itself collapsed and has been liquidating since its 
parent company defaulted on debt payments and filed for bankruptcy 
court protection in february

mobil corp on tuesday reported a 7 percent decline in net 
income in the first quarter mainly reflecting lower petrochemical 
earnings while texaco incs net income plummeted 774 percent and 
shell oil co posted a 44 percent decline 
but chevron corp said its firstquarter net income jumped 51 
percent while phillips petroleum co reported a 363 percent 
increase 
nearly all the companies said they benefitted from higher prices 
of crude oil and natural gas during the quarter in many cases the 
declines in net income were due to special accounting features 
while actual proceeds from oil and gas rose 
mobil the nations secondlargest oil company said its 
earnings slipped to 400 million or 94 cents a share from 429 
million or 104 a share in the first quarter of 1989 
new yorkbased mobil said its chemical division had sharply 
lower earnings reflecting a worldwide drop in petrochemical prices 
from record levels a year earlier earnings from petroleum 
operations rose sharply on the other hand mainly due to higher 
crude and gas prices 
firstquarter revenue rose 64 percent to 149 billion from 
140 billion 
texaco which ranks third behind exxon corp and mobil said its 
net income fell to 328 million or 115 a share from 145 
billion or 591 a share in the first quarter of 1989 however 
results for the yearearlier quarter included a onetime net gain 
of 119 billion resulting mainly from the sale of texaco canada 
inc 
excluding the restructuring gain texacos firstquarter net 
income rose 238 percent to 328 million from 265 million 
texacos steady performance in the first quarter showed strong 
exploration and production earnings reflecting the higher crude 
oil and natural gas prices prevailing during the period james w 
kinnear texacos president and chief executive said however 
there has been a weakening in these prices in the second quarter 
firstquarter revenue declined 47 percent to 916 billion from 
961 billion 
fourthranked chevron credited its strong earnings performance 
to a worldwide increase in the production of oil and gas net 
income for the quarter jumped to 473 million or 133 a share 
from 313 million or 91 cents a share a year earlier 
chevrons firstquarter revenue rose 208 percent to 93 
billion from 77 billion 
we were able to produce natural gas at record levels 
reflecting in part the development of gulf of mexico properties 
purchased from tenneco in 1988 said chief executive officer ken 
derr 
the outlook for the second quarter remains unclear because of 
continued volatility in crude prices derr said chevron based in 
san francisco also is working on finalizing several sales of 
assets that could yield significant net gains this year 
shell the sixthlargest us oil company with headquarters in 
houston is wholly owned by the royal dutchshell group of 
companies a britishdutch enterprise it does not report pershare 
earnings 
shell said the drop in its firstquarter earnings to 203 
million from 362 million was largely due to a 70 million 
insurance settlement gained in the yearearlier quarter 
revenue increased 115 percent to 58 billion from 52 billion 
phillips ranked eleventh said its net income jumped to 259 
million or 106 a share from 190 million or 78 cents a share 
earnings in the first quarter of this year include a net gain of 
148 million from an accounting change and other onetime features

an hour before the closing bell computertriggered sell 
programs kicked in and took the stock market down given how 
light the volume is the market couldnt recover from that little 
straw said dennis jarrett chief market analyst at kidder

higher interest rates lower stock valuations and make corporate 
borrowing more expensive 
alfred e goldman a vice president at ag edwards amp sons inc 
in st louis called the markets performance a little 
disappointing because it tried to go up both the generals and the

with plenty of cash on the sidelines investors so far have not 
had to dump blocks of stocks in order to buy bonds but there is 
concern that the selling of stocks could accelerate if yields go 
higher 
government bonds yielding close to 9 percent proved an 
attractive alternative to equities its a portfolio decision 
jarrett said and it could have an impact on our market

ames department stores inc maintained 
silence on its financial woes tuesday refusing comment on a report 
that it has hired a bankruptcy specialist to prepare a court filing 
to protect ames from creditors 
william roberts an ames spokesman said the rocky hillbased 
retailer would not comment on a report in the hartford courant that 
said ames has hired michael cook a bankruptcy specialist at a 
prominent new york law firm to begin the paperwork for a filing 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act 
the filing would allow ames to continue operating while trying 
to work out a plan to repay its debts 
analysts said bringing in cook indicates how deep the retailers 
fortunes have sunk since it acquired the zayre discount chain in 
late 1988 
when you have a severe stomach ache you go out and get 
yourself the best gastric man you can and at this point theyre 
looking for someone to get them out of this pickle barrel said 
alan millstein publisher of the fashion network report a monthly 
newsletter for retailers and manufacturers 
jeffrey branman managing director for financo inc a new york 
investment bank that specializes in retail industry transactions 
said hiring a bankruptcy specialist could signal an irreversible 
slide toward chapter 11 
its a terrible sign because it means people are preparing for 
it said branman once you start heading down the slippery 
slope its hard to avoid chapter 11 
ames bought 392 zayre discount stores in late 1988 hoping to 
solve their problems and convert them into a format similar to the 
successful one used for ames 
instead ames has been suffering from major losses and cash flow 
shortages since then and has been trying to negotiate new 
financing with its bankers since announcing two weeks ago it would 
post a loss of about 228 million for the fiscal year that ended 
jan 27 
ames officials have maintained a strict silence for the last two 
weeks on the companys financial problems and continued that 
stance tuesday 
all i can tell you is were having discussions that are 
continuing with our bankers said roberts 
roberts also refused comment on reports that some manufacturers 
have suspended shipments to ames because they fear they will not be 
paid 
the gitano group inc a new yorkbased manufacturer of jeans 
and sportswear confirmed tuesday that it had stopped shipments to 
ames about three weeks ago when it became concerned about reports 
of the companys cash flow problems 
weve taken some proactive steps to reduce our exposure with 
ames gitano president haim dabah said we have stopped 
shipping goods until the dust clears 
another supplier pepsicola co the soft drink division of 
pepsico inc denied earlier reports that it has refused to 
deliver to ames unless it is paid in cash 
tod mackenzie a spokesman for pepsicola said tuesday that the 
company is still making regular deliveries to ames its business 
as usual with ames he said 
retail analysts said ames made a number of mistakes in the zayre 
acquisition problems that were intensified by a sluggish retail 
environment in the northeast where many of the stores are located 
sales at the zayre stores have plummeted in recent months 
causing a major cash shortage for ames 
the courant reported that amess discussions with its bankers 
have deteriorated leaving the company little choice but to seek 
refuge in bankruptcy court 
roberts however insisted that the talks are continuing 
according to the courant 20 institutions that own about 100 
million of amess bonds have formed a committee hired a financial 
adviser and proposed that they meet with the companys investment 
bankers to begin negotiating a repayment plan or debt restructuring 
the courant also reported that citibank the lead bank in a 
group of 20 that has granted 900 million of credit to ames has 
hired keen realty consultants of long island ny to begin 
evaluating the value of leases ames holds on its 680 discount 
department stores the retailer operates stores in 20 states and 
washington 
analysts said ames still has a chance to avoid bankruptcy if 
some agreement can be reached in the next few days for the 
companys banks to provide cash to the retailer

firstquarter earnings at sears roebuck and co 
plunged nearly 59 percent because of higherthannormal catastrophe 
claims for allstate insurance group and a loss in the sears 
merchandise group the company said tuesday 
sears reported firstquarter net income of 1063 million or 31 
cents per share compared with 2577 million or 70 cents per 
share in the same period a year earlier 
revenue rose 37 percent fo 1261 billion from 1216 billion 
in 1989 with all business groups reporting record revenue 
sears merchandise group lost 374 million in the first quarter 
of 1990 compared with income of 338 million for the same period 
last year despite a 13 percent increase in revenue 
although lower merchandising results were expected pressure 
on gross margins as well as higher selling costs resulted in an 
unsatisfactory performance said sears chairman edward a brennan 
in a news release 
the revenue increase was offset by rising payroll costs added 
spokesman douglas a fairweather 
allstate reported firstquarter income of 1932 million 
compared with 2439 million in the first quarter of 1989 
those losses were mostly due to the earthquake in california 
and the freezes in late 1989 in the southwest and the southeast 
fairweather said 
with events like that you cant really get a totally accurate 
handle on your costs immediately he said in the case of a 
freeze you have to wait for a thaw to assess damages and the thaw 
came in the first quarter of this year 
the dean witter financial services group had firstquarter 
income of 607 million up 62 percent from last year that 
increase was sparked by a 76 percent jump in income from discover 
card operations to 354 million 
the coldwell banker real estate group reported a loss of 335 
million compared with a loss of 162 million loss in the first 
three months of last year

precious metal futures prices fell tuesday reflecting a general 
lack of investor interest in gold and silver in the face of rising 
interest rates 
on other commodity markets copper futures rose sharply grains 
and soybeans retreated energy futures were mixed and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
gold futures settled 3 to 310 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 37590 a troy 
ounce silver was 10 cents lower across the board with may at about 
5 a troy ounce 
platinum futures fell 650 across the board on the new york 
mercantile exchange where the contract for july delivery settled 
at 48780 a troy ounce 
the retreat followed a strong rally monday in the platinum 
market which was linked to speculation that south african 
political activist nelson mandela was preparing to take a more 
militant stance against apartheid posing a threat of possible 
platinum supply disruptions 
the mandela rumors were discounted tuesday and as platinum 
futures fell the gold and silver markets followed said william 
oneill research director with elders futures inc in new york 
the gold and silver markets kept tumbling though even after 
platinum selling dwindled oneill said the weak tone reflected the 
outlook for higher interest rates which tends to discourage 
investor demand for precious metals 
government bonds yields of close to 9 percent are a major 
negative for the precious metals oneill said 
some of the optimism about rates that existed a few weeks ago 
is completely by the boards now he said nurturing a bearish 
attitude that is steadily weighing on and eroding the precious 
metals 
copper futures climbed strongly on the commodity exchange amid a 
resurgence of buying interest by copper users on indications of 
tight supplies of the metal available for delivery against the 
april contract which expires thursday 
further buying was inspired by a report that officials of 
chiles codelco copper company had lowered their estimate for 1990 
production from the countrys stateowned copper mines to 12 
million to 125 million tons from an earlier estimate of 129 
million tons 
copper futures settled 18 cents to 49 cents higher with april 
at 124 a pound 
grain and soybean futures prices fell substantially on the 
chicago board of trade led by a technically inspired selloff in 
the soybean market analysts said 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 5 cents lower with may at 
367 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with may at 276 
a bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with may at 157 a 
bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 7 cents lower with may at 598 
a bushel 
oil futures finished mixed on the new york mercantile exchange 
ahead of the american petroleum institutes weekly stocks report 
the report released after the close showed an expected increase 
in us refinery activity a fairly large 12millionbarrel 
increase in us crude oil stocks a 926000barrel drop in 
gasoline stocks and a 752000barrel decline in heating oil stocks 
the build in crude stocks extends a pattern of oversupply that 
has been linked to overproduction by the opec nations but the 
higher refinery activity is a seasonal factor that may offset the 
market impact of the rise in oil stocks 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 14 
cents higher with june at 19 a barrel heating oil was 47 cent 
lower to 30 cent higher with may at 5265 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 15 cent to 85 cent higher with may at 6439 cents a 
gallon 
cattle futures fell sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange 
amid weaker cash markets for cattle and beef pork futures ended 
mixed on profit taking after mondays strong gains 
live cattle settled 35 cent to 95 cent lower with june at 
7307 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 75 cent lower 
with april at 8385 cents a pound live hogs were 28 cent lower to 
12 cent higher with june at 6182 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 65 cent lower to 50 cent higher with may at 6440

michael milkens future cooperation with 
federal investigators is expected to yield valuable information for 
other cases the head of the securities and exchange commission 
said tuesday 
but richard breeden declined to specify the particular areas in 
which investigators would seek information from the financier who 
hours earlier pleaded guilty to tax and securities law crimes as 
part of a plea bargain with the government 
this case clearly does involve some significant 
ramifications breeden told a news conference we do expect 
that the testimony and cooperation that we will receive will be 
valuable in the context of other ongoing proceedings and 
proceedings that may be commenced 
milken former head of the highyield junk bond operation of 
drexel burnham lambert inc also agreed to cooperate with 
investigators under the plea bargain that settled the wideranging 
criminal indictment against he and his brother lowell 
the deal also settles civil charges brought by the sec which 
barred both milkens permanently from the securities business 
michael milken will pay fines and restitution totaling 600 
million including 400 million to a civil fund for reimbursing 
investors defrauded by his actions and faces up to 28 years 
imprisonment 
breeden said that under milkens agreement the financier might 
have to take the witness stand in other proceedings that might stem 
from his cooperation with prosecutors 
there has been speculation that one area of interest would be 
the thrift industry where a number of troubled institutions were 
clients of milken and drexel breeden was asked whether the 
governments probe would extend to milkens dealings with the 
thrifts but said he could not specify how investigators would use 
the information milken provided 
he said both the sec and justice department expected much of the 
information generated by their investigations of the milkens would 
prove useful 
but i would not be willing speculate on which specific 
cases or what area of the financial market they might involve 
breeden said 
in its civil case the sec in september 1988 accused milken his 
brother lowell and several others of a scheme that included 
allegations of insider trading securities fraud and other 
violations 
among other allegations the sec charged that milken and drexel 
had a secret arrangement with ivan boesky the convicted stock 
speculator who linked them to his insider trading network 
mr milken has been portrayed as wrongly accused and as 
having simply devoted himself to the financing of small or emerging 
business breeden said noting the public relations campaigns 
milken and drexel had waged in fighting the governments charges 
despite the efforts to mold public opinion mr milkens 
admissions today demonstrate that he stood at the center of a 
network of manipulation fraud and deceit said breeden 
the key question is always does the penalty fit the crime 
said breeden in this case we are extremely pleased with the 
result were extremely pleased with an admission of six felonies 
and the potential here that the perpetrator of these crimes will 
face up to 28 years in prison we think thats a good settlement 
he said if the case had gone to trial it would have taken years 
before victims saw any compensation 
breeden also noted that milken faces up to 28 years in prison 
and contrary to some reports the government will not recommend 
concurrent sentences

the united steelworkers of america said 
tuesday it opposed carl icahns proposal to break up usx corps 
steel and energy assets 
the icahn proposal would represent in our view another 
erroneous step away from usxs traditional corporate purpose the 
union said in a statement 
the uswa believes that such a step is not in the longterm 
interest ofthe employees or shareholders of usx 
icahn usxs largest shareholder has proposed spinning off the 
companys steel business saying two separate companies will be 
worth more than one to shareholders the plan will be put to a 
nonbinding vote of stockholders at the companys annual meeting 
may 7 in findlay ohio 
the unions statement was approved april 18 by 46 union local 
presidents representing 18000 members employed by usx it was 
reviewed by the securities and exchange commission before being 
released 
the icahn proposal in our view would continue the usxs 
steady surrender of its interest in steel production creating a 
weaker steel company which would be far more susceptible to 
cyclical downturns in the economy and less able to modernize and 
profit substantially during upturns the statement said

here are the six federal securities and tax law 
violations outlined in financier michael milkens guilty plea in 
us district court on tuesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
conspiracy 
the government said milken former stock speculator ivan f 
boesky drexel client david solomon of solomon asset management and 
others conspired to violated federal tax and securities laws 
the conspiracy involved transactions detailed in the five other 
counts including illegal stock trades hidden from federal 
regulators secret records kept separate from drexels official 
books tax evasion and federal securities rules violations 
the government said milken and the others profited from 
transactions while investors were cheated 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aiding and abetting the filing of false documents with the 
securities and exchange commission 
the government said the violation was designed to help boesky by 
concealing his stock holdings in fischbach corp a construction 
business that was the subject of a takeover attempt by pennsylvania 
engineering corp 
milken admitted that he failed to record a deal compensating 
boesky for trading losses in fischbach from april 1984 to february 
1985 boesky had acquired more than 10 percent of fischbach on 
milkens recommendation and milken promised to to cover any trading 
losses 
the government said boesky lost several million dollars buying 
fischbach stock which drexel more than made up for under the 
secret arrangement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
securities fraud 
milken admitted to arranging a secret purchase by boesky of mca 
corp stock held by drexel client golden nugget inc from march to 
november 1984 
golden nugget a las vegasbased casino operator had purchased 
99 million in mca stock during a planned takeover of the 
entertainment giant the government said milken induced boesky to 
buy about 875000 shares of mca stock to try to hide from the 
market that golden nugget was dumping its position 
the move was designed to prop up the price of mca stock which 
would have fallen if word of the large sales by golden nugget 
became public boeskys illegal purchases created the false 
appearance of wide market demand 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aiding and abetting the violation of sec reporting requirements 
for brokerdealers 
the government said drexel in 1985 bought about 1 million shares 
of helmerich amp payne corp stock worth more than 20 million from 
boesky and agreed to hold the stock for boesky who in turn 
promised to to make up any losses suffered by drexel drexel later 
sold some of the stock back to boesky 
the deal allowed boesky to cheat on his taxes free up cash to 
buy more stock and overstate the amount of net capital in his 
seemala corp the government said by failing to report the stock 
sales milken helped boesky violate federal laws the government 
said

finsbury group ltd a drexelorganized international investment

drexels junk bond department in beverly hills calif paid 
fees to salesmen who marketed the finsbury shares and solomon then 
funneled money back to the junk bond department by setting up deals 
between drexel and solomons clients

provide cash that could go back to drexel but solomons clients 
were kept in the dark about the arrangement the arrangement 
involved transactions from 1984 to 1986 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
aiding and abetting the filing of a false tax return 
milken admitted setting up prearranged trades that allowed 
solomon to claim shortterm capital losses and reduce his 1985 tax 
liability

milken would pay back solomon for his losses the following year 
milken in 1986 let solomon acquire a limited partnership interest 
that solomon sold for a profit that was higher than the earlier 
bogus losses the government said

while friends and family watched michael 
milkens voice stumbled and cracked as one of the financial worlds 
most prominent figures confronted his own words guilty 
it was a stunning and poignant moment of truth even for veteran 
visitors to manhattan federal court where towering figures ranging 
from john mitchell to leona helmsley have been digested and spit 
out as felons 
its a tragedy to see historys greatest financier so 
humbled said theodore wells a prominent defense attorney and 
one of many milken supporters who witnessed his admission that he 
broke the law 
i believe there was an injustice done said lorraine spurge 
a longtime milken colleague at drexel burnham lambert incs junk 
bond department in beverly hills calif who works at his new 
consulting firm i believe he is a very brave man 
the atmosphere was hushed and solemn spectators sat on the edge 
of the benches straining to hear milken sobbingly plead guilty to 
six charges securities and tax law violations 
about 250 reporters sketch artists lawyers and friends waited 
for more than an hour in the hallway and then crammed into the us 
district court in lower manhattan 
it was the same courtroom in which milken flanked by his 
attorneys arthur liman and martin flumenbaum pleaded innocent to 
a 98count racketeering and fraud indictment on march 29 1989 
then milken promised to fight what he called spurious 
allegations through the criminal justice system on tuesday he did 
the opposite 
the 43yearold son of an accountant entered the courtroom from 
a rear door and answered in a firm voice judge kimba woods 
questions about whether he understood he was giving up his 
constitutional right to a jury trial 
it was later when milken ended his 10minute statement to the 
court with an apology that he broke down in sobs 
this investigation and proceeding are now in their fourth 
year he said choking on the words this long period has been 
extremely painful and difficult for my family and friends as well 
as myself 
liman placed his hand on milkens back to support the fallen 
financier milken then slumped into a chair and took a few minutes 
to compose himself sipping water from a plastic foam cup 
he stood again and wood asked mr milken how do you plead 
to the charges guilty or not guilty 
milkens voice cracked on the first word guilty your honor 
after being charged with 98 counts and four years of being 
harassed its very difficult for anyone to stand that kind of 
situation martin klein a bankruptcy attorney and milken friend 
said later 
the only levity occurred when wood asked assistant us attorney 
john carroll whether the 600 million milken agreed to pay covered 
the cost of the governments investigation 
if you see my w2 form it does by a long shot carroll 
said prompting some laughter 
milkens arrival and departure from the courthouse were 
chronicled by a throng of photographers and camera crews lining the 
courthouses steps 
milken with wife lori on his arm appeared dazed as he 
stepped out of his black car several marshals helped the couple 
through the crush shoving away photographers who surged forward 
other family members in court were milkens mother his 
fatherinlaw and his brother lowell who was cleared of all 
wrongdoing as part of the plea deal 
on the courthouse steps one young man who said he worked in the 
financial sector but declined to give his name said he was a milken 
fan hes a financial wizard he said he just got greedy

usx corp said tuesday its firstquarter profit fell 40 percent 
from results that included onetime gains a year ago while 
bethlehem steel corp reported its earnings for the quarter tumbled 
671 percent 
usx a pittsburghbased oil and steel giant said it earned 176 
million or 66 cents per share in the latest three months compared 
with 296 million or 109 per share a year earlier 
its sales rose 44 percent to 47 billion from 45 billion a 
year earlier 
reults for the first quarter of 1989 included favorable special 
items of 197 million in operating income and a 74 million pretax 
gain from asset disposals the company said 
excluding these 1989 special items income before tax improved 
by 71 million from the first quarter of last year chairman 
charles corry said in a statement 
he said the companys marathon oil subsidiary had a strong 
quarter while the companys steel operations improved as the 
quarter progressed 
our steel order book has been stronger than anticipated since 
the end of february he said 
corry said firstquarter results demonstrate the success of a 
restructuring program that began a decade ago 
the energy and steel combination that has emerged has 
permitted the company to perform well under widely varying business 
conditions steel earned more operating income than energy in 
1988 and in 1989 the reverse was true he said 
carl icahn usxs largest shareholder wants to spin off the 
companys steel business saying two separate companies will be 
worth more than one 
the plan will be put to a nonbinding vote of usx stockholders 
at the companys may 7 annual meeting in findlay ohio 
usxs operating income for the first quarter was 354 million 
compared with 514 million in the first quarter of 1989 
usxs energy segment reported operating income of 237 million 
on sales of 33 billion in the first quarter that compared with 
operating income of 388 million on sales of 28 billion in the 
same period last year 
usxs steel segment reported firstquarter operating income of 
60 million on sales of 13 billion in the first quarter of last 
year the segment posted operating income of 99 million on sales 
of 15 billion 
the declines in steel operating income and sales were primarily 
attributed to lower steel prices and the effects of the sale of 
lorain works in ohio to a 50 percentowned joint venture in the 
second quarter of last year usx said 
bethlehem steel said slumping steel markets and higher operating 
costs resulted in the decline in its profit 
the bethlehem pabased company said it had net income of 213 
million or 20 cents per share in the quarter down from 647 
million or 78 cents a share a year ago 
net sales fell to 122 billion from 140 billion last year 
steel shipments were 19 percent lower than a year ago and raw 
steel production dropped to 70 percent of capacity from 82 percent 
income from basic steel operations was 29 million this past 
quarter compared with 137 million for the same period last year 
steel demand was particularly strong in early 1989 and the 
lower shipments in the first quarter of 1990 resulted from weaker 
demand primarily from the construction and automotive markets 
reduced shipments of semifinished steel to other steel producers 
and competitive pressures in the structural products market 
chairman walter f williams said in a statement 
increased costs were attributable to modernization and repair 
projects at the sparrows point plant and blast furnace 
interruptions at burns harbor the company said 
a new contract with the united steelworkers of america that 
began june 1 1989 boosted employment costs the company said

to relax restrictions on the sale of computers and other hightech 
items to eastern europe 
at a time when an already impatient germany is reunifying 
merging europes greatest industrial power with the nation that had 
the closest ties to the soviets we must reconsider the structure 
of our export control system said rep sam gejdenson dconn 
chairman of the house subcommittee on international economic policy 
and trade 
the measure which now goes to the house foreign affairs 
committee would allow the sale of many items but it would draw a 
clear line between munitions and other technologies 
it would also clarify the role of the defense department and it 
would increase penalties for willful violation of the act

two northeast senators said tuesday they would 
sponsor a bipartisan bill combining nine major housing programs 
into a single grant that would be distributed to states and cities 
sens alfonse damato rny and chris dodd dconn said 
they were offering their proposal as a way to speed up 
rehabilitation and construction of subsidized housing and give 
local governments more control 
their proposal ran into a cool reception from housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp 
kemps spokeswoman mary brunette said the idea was kind of 
at odds with our approach she said giving the money directly to 
local governments comes as hud is seeking greater federal oversight 
over local public housing authorities 
their proposal would combine money from nine categorical hud 
programs into a new housing grant action program the consolidated 
programs include the 202 elderly and handicapped housing program 
the scandalplagued moderate rehabilitation program public and 
indian housing programs and the housing development action grant 
program 
they program would not provide increased federal money but would 
continue them at current levels totaling 71 billion the money 
would be distributed by formula with 70 percent to local 
governments and 30 percent to states

times mirror corp said tuesday its 
firstquarter profit fell 33 percent largely because of an 
advertising slowdown that hit its northeastern newspapers consumer 
magazines and broadcast tv operations 
for the quarter ending april 1 times mirrors earnings fell to 
46 million or 36 cents per share down from 688 million or 53 
cents per share a year earlier 
revenues rose 33 percent to 8752 million from 8469 million 
but times mirror said its slide in earnings was partially 
attributable to higher promotional costs and higher circulation 
that pushed up operating costs at the los angeles times 
although our professional publishing and cable television 
operations achieved solid earnings growth during the quarter their 
performance only partially offset the marked deterioration in our 
newspaper publishing segment said robert f erburu times 
mirrors chairman and chief executive 
ad volume was slow at the northeastern newspapers with newsday 
and new york newsday suffering from a depressed new york economy 
times mirror said the 1990 first quarter also had one less sunday 
than the yearearlier period which reduced revenues 
despite increased revenues at the los angeles times a surge in 
circulation increased operating costs contributing to a 38 percent 
decline in operating profit from newspapers 
times mirror said its companywide circulation as reported to 
the audit bureau of circulations but not yet verified rose 41 
percent for the daily papers and 32 percent on sunday over the 
past six months 
at the los angeles times daily circulation during the same 
period rose by 81 percent to 1210077 with sunday circulation up 
57 percent to 1504540 the company said publisher david 
laventhol estimated half the increase was from former readers of 
the nowclosed herald examiner 
new york newsday grew by 116 percent to 217514 daily 
circulation during the six months and the hartford conn courant 
reported a 22 percent rise to 230358 the company said 
although consumer magazines also were affected by the 
advertising slowdown the book magazine and other publishing 
segment still had a 136 percent increase in quarterly revenues and 
217 percent growth in operating profit due to gains by the legal 
publishing flight information and training businesses

bond prices finished mixed tuesday as 
shortterm issues declined while longerterm issues were unchanged 
to slightly higher 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond edged up 132 point 
or 31 cents for every 1000 in face value its yield which falls 
when prices rise slipped to 895 percent from 896 percent late 
monday 
through monday the 30year bond had plunged more than 41 per 
1000 over seven trading days in response to signs of increasing 
inflation a stronger economy and worries about upcoming bond 
issues including the treasurys quarterly refunding auction set 
for next month 
higher inflation and an economic upturn could prompt the federal 
reserve to keep interest rates high higher rates erode the value 
of fixedreturn investments such as bonds 
analysts said bond prices recovered tuesday morning but later 
were driven lower by unconfirmed rumors that the fed planned to 
tighten interest rates in the near future 
jay goldinger a principal of capital insight inc in beverly 
hills calif described the market as very jittery 
behind every buyer they think theres the ghost of another 
seller he said 
the government reported tuesday that orders to us factories 
for du part of a personal 
vendetta within the commission staff 
stello in two confirmation appearances before the senate armed 
services committee last fall strongly denied that he acted 
improperly he asserted that nuclear safety was his primary concern 
in 24 years as a regulator 
the armed services committee had been set to recommend stellos 
confirmation in january but balked upon learning that he was the 
focus of an investigation by david williams the inspector general 
of the nuclear regulatory commission 
williams is investigating allegations that stello and other 
officials pursued a vendetta against roger fortuna a commission 
official in charge of investigating wrongdoing at nuclear plants 
the allegation was that stello felt fortuna was too hard on the 
industry 
the results of the williams probe have not been made public but 
in his letter to bush stello noted that the armed services 
committee planned to hold up further consideration of his 
nomination until it reviewed the results of williams investigation 
my experience over this past year has lead me to the 
conclusion that final action by the senate on my nomination will 
not take place in the foreseeable future he wrote 
stello also wrote that aspects of my personal health also 
played a role in his decision he suffered serious injuries in a 
skiiing accident in january 
this accident has given me an opportunity to more sharply 
focus on those matters which i consider of significant personal 
importance he wrote without elaborating 
stello said he believed it was important that bush find someone 
who can quickly be confirmed in the job of weapons chief in order 
that work under way to resuscitate the aging bombproduction 
complex not be hindered by political bickering 
in my view it is in the interest of our country for you to 
identify another nominee for this critical position he wrote 
energy secretary james d watkins had no immediate comment on 
stellos decision to withdraw said catherine kaliniak a 
department spokeswoman 
last fall watkins told the armed services committee at the 
outset of stellos confirmation hearings that he could find no 
other qualified individual willing to take the job which he called 
one of the toughest jobs in government 
olson said he could not comment on whether watkins had found a 
nominee to replace stello

santa fe pacific corp said tuesday it plans to 
spin off its energy and real estate subsidiaries to shareholders by 
the end of the year leaving the company focused on its railroad 
operations 
the company plans to sell its stake of over 80 percent in santa 
fe energy resources and santa fe realty co in the third quarter of 
this year orval adam vice president and chief financial officer 
said at the companys annual shareholder meeting 
weve been trying to separate those companies so shareholders 
would have the benefit of separate management and separate 
investment possibilities adam said 
weve had a gas and oil exploration company a real estate 
company and a railroad when you invest in a company you like to 
know what youre investing in if you want to invest in real 
estate your money should go into real estate 
the spinoffs are contingent on the company refinancing a 780 
million paymentinkind debenture and a ruling from the internal 
revenue service that the spinoffs constitute a taxfree dividend 
the company said 
santa fe pacific will continue to operate the atchison topeka 
and santa fe railway 
the spinoffs are unrelated to recent poor performance by the 
railroad which announced monday it would lay off 850 workers 
nationwide due to downturns in shipments of automobiles and grain 
adam said 
the last couple of months here have not been up to snuff and 
were looking toward making some expense cuts adam said 
but the spinoff has been a longerterm objective in our 
restructuring poor performance in one month or a couple of months 
wont affect that 
santa fe pacific realty a san franciscobased developer holds 
about 2 million acres of developed and undeveloped land in 13 
states adam said 
the company holds 107 million square feet of developed 
industrial office and retail space has 18 million square feet 
under construction he said it plans to develop nearly 27 million 
square feet in the next five years he added 
santa fe energy resources based in houston is an independent 
oil and gas company it had reserves of 251 million barrels of oil 
equivalent at the end of 1989 adam said daily production in 1989 
averaged more than 50000 barrels of oil and almost 82 million 
cubic feet of natural gas he said 
following the spinoffs santa fe pacific will continue to own 
and operate the railway and santa fe pacific minerals corp and 
will retain its 44 percent interest in santa fe pacific pipeline 
partners adam said 
after the stockholders meeting richard d foley chairman of 
the american employees stock ownership association announced the 
filing of a shareholder suit against the company 
the suit seeks recovery of fees and costs arising from a proxy 
fight in 1988 protesting the companys shareholder rights plan the 
fight resulted in a revision of the plan that would allow fully 
financed offers if they receive approval from 80 percent of the 
shareholders 
jerome f donohoe of santa fe pacifics legal department said 
the company had rejected a request from foley for about 600000 in 
fees and costs

a universal press syndicate owner said tuesday he 
insisted the dallas morning news take all of his companys features 
that had been appearing in the rival dallas times herald 
old harry s truman said the buck stops here ups 
coowner john mcmeel testified in harris county district court 
ill take the heat the buck stops here 
mcmeel testified at the trial over the times heralds 33 
million antitrust lawsuit against the morning news the times 
herald said the ups deal with the morning news unfairly turned over 
to its larger competitor features and comics that included 
doonesbury dear abby and erma bombeck 
mcmeel said he made his request as ups was negotiating a joint 
television venture with the morning news and its parent company 
ah belo corp 
although morning news editor burl osborne for years had been 
inquiring about the availability of two ups comics doonesbury and 
the far side which were appearing in the times herald mcmeel 
said he would consider the joint venture only if the newspaper took 
all 26 features 
i had to make it very plain mcmeel said i was not going 
to just take two features out of the dallas times herald i just 
wasnt going to do it this television opportunity was a project 
we had been waiting for i said everything had to get out so we can 
evaluate the whole package 
the times herald is seeking 33 million in actual damages plus 
unspecified punitive damages in the trial which is in its fourth 
week the case is expected to go to the jury next week 
the times herald contends the comics transfer was a deliberate 
move by the morning news and belo to build a monopoly in dallas and 
drive the times herald out of business the morning news and belo 
have denied any wrongdoing 
the joint venture known as universal belo is producing 
television programs based on characters appearing in comic strips 
syndicated by kansas citybased ups 
in his second day of testimony mcmeel said competing syndicates 
already were involved in television programming and the joint 
venture was a matter of survival 
mcmeel said he also feared a hostile environment at the 
times herald if ups canceled only doonesbury and the far side 
asked if the loss of the features could help close the newspaper 
he replied absolutely not 
mcmeel said the times herald was not given a chance to bid on 
the television project because the venture was breaking new ground 
the objective was to create an entity and you dont bid on an 
entity he said this was something new 
under cross examination by times herald attorney wayne fisher 
mcmeel said he could not enter a television deal with belo while 
ups features remained in the times herald 
belo corp was not going to be enthusiastic about superstars 
being created across the street at the dallas times herald he 
said 
fisher tried to show that at the time the joint venture 
discussions took place the features remained under contract with 
the times herald he also alleged that osborne proposed the 
transfer but mcmeel disputed that contention

a federal bankruptcy judge named an examiner to 
probe some of the tangled affairs of general development corp 
which has admitted overpricing homes and deceiving buyers about 
their value 
the examiner is kathleen durdin a certified public accountant 
and a vice president of peterson and company a tampa managment 
consulting firm 
david bird assistant us trustee for the southern district of 
florida told us bankruptcy judge a jay cristol on tuesday that 
the gdc creditors committee settled on durdin after interviewing 
11 applicants monday 
general development filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy april 6 
claiming a severe cash shortage after failing to secure 60 million 
in shortterm credit 
the miamibased developer and its two top executives pleaded 
guilty last month in federal court to mailfraud conspiracy for 
overpricing thousands of homes and lying to the buyers 
last week cristol approved a plan that allows gdc to receive 
105 million in temporary financing for six weeks while it 
arranges permanent financing general development already owes 175 
million to the eight banks who guaranteed the interim financing 
in making the appointment official cristol said ms durdin 
was not to take over the management or the creditors committee 
of gdc but was to work with the courtappointed officials to bring 
about a reorganization 
cristol also said he has recommended that us district judge

despite a lastminute attempt by 
opponents to buy more time the pennsylvania house on tuesday sent 
gov robert p casey a bill that would enact the nations toughest 
curbs against hostile takeovers 
after a brief debate the house approved the bill 18317 the 
senate gave its final backing to the measure monday 
casey has said he would sign the bill administration spokesman 
john taylor said the governor has 10 days to act on it 
supporters of the measure praised its protections for workers 
and said it would help business thrive in pennsylvania 
rep marvin e miller jr said the bill would serve as the 
fundamental basis for economic development for the future 
by passing this were sending a loud and clear message that 
people cant make simple quick chop shops out of our 
corporations he said 
the republican lawmaker represents the city of lancaster whose 
leading employer was the target of a takeover attempt that spawned 
the bill the belzberg family of canada last year tried to take 
over armstrong world industries inc a floor and tile manufacturer 
under the bill a raider who tried to sell shares within 18 
months of a takeover bid would be forced to give up shortterm 
profits the bill also would deny raiders voting rights until a 
majority of a corporations stockholders approved 
passage came easily despite gloomy warnings the bill would make 
pennsylvania less competitive with other states and would protect 
bad managers 
this is bad for labor in pennsylvania bad for pennsylvania 
business and bad for the state of pennsylvania said rep robert 
godshall this would strip any basic and fundamental rights of 
stockholders 
the bill also would allow management to weigh the interests of 
employees customers or the community rather than just 
shareholders when considering takeover bids 
if corporate ownership changes hands labor contracts would have 
to be honored and severance would be paid to laid off workers up 
to 90 days after the law takes effect corporations would be able 
to exempt themselves from the legislation 
members of the investment community including the chairman of 
the securities and exchange commission have criticized the bill 
saying it would entrench management and deny shareholders rights 
with the junk bond market in shambles and takeovers on the wane 
some critics have argued that the legislation is overkill 
but supporters including state business and labor interests 
argue it will protect jobs and communities while giving 
shareholders longterm stability 
william titelman lawyer for the belzberg family predicted the 
bill would scare investors from putting money into pennsylvania 
corporations 
i think its a very sad day a dangerous day because we are 
now confronted with a bill that has been properly perceived by 
investors across the country and even overseas as a piece of 
legislation which tells them that pennsylvania is not a good place 
to invest titelman said

the charitable foundations michael milken and 
his brother endowed with hundreds of millions of dollars will carry 
on and the notoriety of his wall street fraud case probably will 
generate even more demands for help their director said 
skeptics question the motives for the milkens philanthropy 
which became more highprofile after the government revealed its 
investigation of him for alleged racketeering and other crimes 
but friends and beneficiaries of milkens largesse say his 
charity work began long before the probe and was performed with an 
intensity mirroring his deal making particularly when children 
were involved 
some people make snide remarks and say hes just trying to 
atone said melba f coleman the principal of 102nd street 
school in watts i say look at the record he didnt just start 
this when he was indicted 
milken taught math at the elementary school for a day recently 
bringing along pop star michael jackson as a treat for the children 
in the economically depressed area 
milken brought in fruit vegetables and calculators to 
illustrate his lessons and had to be dragged away from the students 
at the end of the day said mrs coleman he called back to 
volunteer again even before shed written him a thankyou note she 
added 
i tell the kids you need to dream big you need role 
models mrs coleman said im sure he made a difference for 
them 
jules lesner the director of the foundations of the milken 
families said their operations will be unaffected by milkens 
guilty plea tuesday to six felonies 
publicity about those pleas and the 600 million in fines and 
restitution milken agreed to pay will mean just an increase in 
the number of requests lesner said more people are aware 
were here and what we do 
milken and his brother lowell have established four foundations 
in all with endowments that now total nearly 400 million 
operating out of offices not far from milkens home in the san 
fernando valley they fund educational programs and awards to 
educators health care cancer and epilepsy research child care 
museums job retraining sports programs 
a jewish community center in the west san fernando valley was 
built with millions of dollars in foundation money children at the 
los angeles zoo can enter a cave to learn about pallid bats and 
ringtail cats and a desert area to study sidewinders and gila 
monsters thanks to a 1 million donation 
another 1 million went toward the museum of tolerance the 
jewish holocaust education facility under construction at the simon 
wiesenthal center in west los angeles 
his involvement with our charity goes back many years to at 
least 1983 said rabbi marvin hier of the wiesenthal center 
whenever we asked him to do something it was always a 
personal involvement never just sending a check 
when michael milken would speak to you about charitable 
projects he would make it sound as if you were the most important 
person in the world and you were the only person he was concerned 
with at that moment hier said 
even in charity milkens activities were questioned rep john 
d dingell dmich who heads the house subcommittee on oversight 
and investigations asked the california attorney generals office 
to determine if milken illegally benefited from the foundations 
trades or assets after a ninemonth probe investigators reported 
last august that he had not 
richard riordan a friend of milkens who is a lawyer and fellow 
philanthropist said milken genuinely loves dealing with children 
especially minority children 
his attitude is sort of an underdog its a bit of the jewish 
culture the underdog culture the ethic that they have to give to 
others but theres something very special about him anything he 
does hes handson riordan said 
riordan said he expects milken to continue his charitable work 
from behind bars if he goes to prison 
at the 102nd street school mrs coleman said some teachers had 
gone out of their way to make sure she heard their criticism of 
milken accusing him of selfpromotion for his visit 
the children felt differently she said 
today some of them seemed kind of sad she said they 
were saying will he come back will he have to go to jail

harsco corps board of directors on 
tuesday rejected a washington investment groups suggestion that it 
sell its defense divisions and borrow 300 million for a special 
dividend 
the 11member board met privately and late in the day issued a 
copy of a letter sent to frank carlucci vice president of the 
carlyle group which had called for the steps 
the letter said the board has considered and rejected such 
strategies before but said carlucci could meet with harsco 
representatives to discuss the matter further carlucci was defense 
secretary late in the reagan administration 
calls to harsco and carlyle for comment on the letter went 
unanswered late in the day 
before the directors meeting harscos president and chief 
executive told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company 
was not considering any offers to sell its defense divisions in 
york pa or marysville ohio 
i want to state emphatically that no part of the defense group 
has been sold and that we are not now engaged in discussions to 
sell any part of the defense group malcolm w gambill told 
shareholders 
harscos defense group also includes bmywheeled vehicles in 
marysville and tactical truck corp a joint venture with general 
motors ttc has won a us government contract to develop new 
25ton and 5ton trucks which harsco expects will be produced at 
marysville fifteen prototypes are being tested by the army 
gambill said the company feels it has a considerable potential 
for international sales of its current military truck produced at 
marysville and intends to boost daily production to 40 a day the 
company now makes 30 trucks a day 
since 1988 harsco has cut 393 percent of the workforce 1019 
salaried and wage employees at the york plant but gambill told 
stockholders the cost cutting and improvements made over an 
unprofitable military earthmoving vehicle known as ace will 
return the york division to a nominally profitable operation in the 
near future 
problems with the ace vehicle cut 1989 earnings from 256 a 
share to 43 cents a share the defense group lost 444 million in 
1988 and 719 million in 1989 
we now know what it takes to efficiently build this vehicle 
said gambill adding that harsco is negotiating with an 
international customer for a large order of the vehicles 
by a 5710 margin stockholders rejected a proposal by the new 
york state teachers retirement system to withdraw from an 
investment in heckett south africa ltd which it coowns with 
south african iron and steel industrial corp ltd 
harsco said in a statement that it feels it was influentual in 
eliminating racebased wage and salary discrepancies at hsa and 
helping it adopt nondiscriminatory policies on housing loans 
educational assistance job training and company restaurants the 
company said the proposal would result in abandoning black 
employees rather than benefiting them
