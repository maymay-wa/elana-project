it was a nightmare come true wednesday afternoon 
a crowded classroom at the university of montreal engineering 
building and a rifleman in hunting clothes picking out his victims 
before firing 
by the time the gunman killed himself he had shot 14 women to 
death and wounded 12 others six women were shot to death in the 
first classroom he entered and a seventh in another room then the 
man prowled the halls killing three women in the cafeteria and 
four more women in the corridor of the third floor where he then 
shot himself 
witnesses described the scene in the first classroom at the 
beginning of the massacre 
i was doing a presentation in front of the class and suddenly 
a guy came in with what i think was a semiautomatic rifle 
engineering student eric chavarie said 
he told us to stop everything 
and then when we looked at him we thought it was a joke but 
he fired a shot in the air and separated us into two groups the 
guys in one corner and the girls in another corner 
when that was done he asked the guys to leave he left the 
girls in there 
we got outside in the hallway and for a couple of minutes he 
stayed in there and after when we got out he leveled his gun at a 
group of people who were there and he shot three or four shots 
pierre robert 25 a student in the classroom said he told 
the guys to move to one side and the girls to the other nobody 
moved we thought it was a joke it was our last hour of the term 
we practically laughed 
i thought it was a blank said robert who was close to a 
classropm wall at which the gunman fired i didnt see anything 
on the wall but it made a very loud noise 
when he came in he was really calm but after the first shot 
his voice became nervous 
professor yvon bouchard who taught the mechanical engineering 
course was sitting at his desk listening to the student 
presentation when the gunman entered 
i didnt see him walk in when i saw him he was two or three 
feet from the students presenting their project bouchard said 
then he asked all the men to go one one side of the room and 
the women on the other 
nobody moved we thought it was a joke 
it doesnt make sense 
student luc gauthier 24 left the classroom about 5 pm 
the gunman entered carrying an object that looked like a rifle 
in a trash bag 
i went to the bathroom and when i came back people were 
running out screaming theres a crazy guy in there hes shot 
people gauthier said 
i went to get my things and saw there was blood in front of 
the photocopy machine 
someone told me the first person he shot when he came out of 
the classroom was a girl in front of the photocopy machine 
francois bordeleau a student who ran from the first to the 
second floor said he dragged people by the collar to keep them 
from going downstairs to see the gunman 
student vanthona ouy 22 tore the sleeve on his coat as he fled 
the building 
i saw death up close and i shook i dropped everything and 
ran he said 
student serge bacon said i was in the stairwell and someone 
came up the stairs shouting watch out watch out hes coming i 
thought he was joking 
yannick lacoste a student who had just left the school library 
when she heard about five consecutive gunshots in the hallways 
said people were yelling someone is firing and students were 
running through the halls 
i hurried to the door i was very nervous you dont know if 
the shots are aimed at you

a truck bomb containing a halfton of 
dynamite exploded outside secret police headquarters during the 
morning rush hour wednesday killing at least 35 people and 
wounding hundreds 
the bomb presumably the work of drug gangs was the most 
powerful to strike the capital since colombias cocaine traffickers 
began a wave of terror after the government declared war on them 16 
weeks ago president virgilio barco told colombians they face an 
escalation in drugrelated violence 
late wednesday three bombs exploded in medellin the hub of a 
major cocainetrafficking cartel a police spokesman told the 
associated press by telephone from the city he said they went off 
at an electronics shop a morman temple and an evangelical church 
without injuring anyone 
police also deactivated a car bomb a block from the offices of 
dozens of judges in bogota on wednesday afternoon the national 
police said 
barco said late wednesday in a nationally televised speech that 
drug traffickers had begun a new wave of terrorism intended to stop 
extradition of suspects to the united states and to destroy 
colombian democracy 
we must not we will not ever fall before the drug 
traffickers barco said in the speech broadcast by radio and 
television from tokyo where he was on a state visit the stable 
democracy that we have built with great effort and defended for 
more than a century is in danger 
the bogota blast which tore open a crater 20 feet deep and 
destroyed or heavily damaged a score of buildings occurred less 
than 24 hours after government investigators said a bomb caused the 
crash of a colombian jetliner last month that killed 107 people 
no one claimed responsibility directly for wednesdays 
explosion but gen faruk yanine bogota police chief said it was 
undoubtedly the work of drug traffickers 
a statement from the socalled extraditables delivered to 
newspapers and radio stations in medellin said we will stop the 
war only when the senate understands the people must be our judge 
the reference was to a bill that would permit a national 
referendum on extraditing drug trafficking suspects wanted in the 
united states the house of representatives approved it tuesday 
night 
barcos government opposes the measure contending the drug 
barons would step up terrorism before a referendum to frighten 
voters into rejecting extradition 
in his comments barco blamed traffickers for the bombing of the 
jetliner last month for tuesdays assassination of a judge in 
medellin and for the bombing of the secret police headquarters he 
said the three attacks represent a vile assault by the 
traffickers 
these incidents show that what these criminals are capable of 
as they make sure that the referendum results are in their favor 
barco said who was scheduled to return from japan on friday 
in their statement the extraditables said the president 
should not fear what the congress decides because the congress is 
the voice of the people and the voice of the people is the voice 
of god 
minister of government carlos lemos simmonds told reporters 
after the bombing the slaughter that we warned of when the house 
approved extradition in the plebiscite has started he is acting 
president while barco is on the state visit 
the bogota bomb went off at 730 am in an area crowded with 
people bound for work on foot and in cars 
so powerful was the explosion that it broke windows in a 
building across the street from the us embassy seven miles away 
caracol quoted sources with explosives experts at the scene as 
saying the truck was packed with 1100 pounds of dynamite 
reports on the number of dead and wounded varied and rescuers 
were pulling bodies from the rubble of buildings hours after the 
blast 
health minister eduardo diaz said in an interview with caracol 
that at least 35 people were killed 250 seriously wounded and 750 
treated for cuts abrasions shock and shock unconfirmed reports 
gave higher death tolls 
however the television news program 24 hours reported the 
death toll rose to 40 late wednesday police said they were unable 
to confirm that report 
the explosion blew the facade off the secret police headquarters 
and destroyed virtually all its walls and windows also heavily 
damaged were an office building for federal judges across the 
street and the national transit police headquarters a block away 
half a dozen stores across the street from secret police 
headquarters were reduced to smoking rubble and about 60 cars were 
destroyed 
visa renewal is one function of the secret police or department 
of administrative security many foreigners usually are there on 
any given weekday but it was not known whether foreigners were 
among the dead and wounded 
this is a busy season because many foreigners go home for 
christmas and cannot do so without reports of clean police records 
minutes after the explosion detectives at secret police 
headquarters scrambled up ladders and from the remains of cells 
pulled two stunned prisoners awaiting extradition to the united 
states the prisoners were taken away in an armored vehicle 
lemos said on caracol the bombing illustrated the futility of 
trying to negotiate with the drug gangs he said the government 
would not lessen its resolve to crush them 
in their statement about the second bomb in bogota the national 
police said the device was hidden in a subcompact renault parked in 
front of a government building where dozens of judges have their 
offices the police did not say how much dynamite was in the car 
barco began the war on traffickers hours after they assassinated 
a leading presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan on aug 
16 during a campaign speech in bogota 
he also reinstated extradition of suspects to the united states 
which was suspended by supreme court rulings in 1987 and 1988 nine 
have been sent to the united states the past three months 
an avianca airlines passenger jet exploded in the air nov 27 
and all 107 people aboard were killed the government tuesday said 
a bomb caused the explosion 
not counting the plane crash victims or the victims of 
wednesdays truck bomb 29 people have been killed and 238 wounded 
by 201 bombs since galans assassination

japans defense budget already judged the third 
largest in the world will continue to grow even as the superpowers 
talk about cutting back on military spending officials say 
in a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relations 
like those occurring in europe japan has at best cool relations 
with the soviet union as the two countries are deadlocked over an 
old territorial dispute and the united states is pressing tokyo to 
increase its budgetary support for us forces based in japan 
japans military budget always controversial in light of a 
constitution that bans war has grown steadily through the 1980s to 
increase the countrys ability to fend off soviet attack 
it is separate from superpower arms reductions from that 
point of view so our own efforts for improving our selfdefense 
are not expected to change at the moment foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe told a news conference tuesday 
he was asked if the outcome of the superpower summit in malta 
which gave new impetus to arms negotiations between the united 
states and soviet union would reduce japans military spending 
the united states is starting to plan for defense cuts and us 
defense secretary dick cheney says the soviets have reduced 
military spending 
japanese newspapers reported today that seiki nishihiro vice 
minister of the defense agency had cautioned the public against 
thinking that the superpower summit could result in a cutback in 
this countrys defense budget 
and an anonymous foreign ministry official was quoted in the 
yomiuri shimbun daily as saying the asian situation is 
completely different from that of europe and still remains 
unstable japan needs to develop a minimum defense strength for 
deterrence 
last week the asahi shimbun newspaper reported that the defense 
budget would grow a hefty 6 percent in the fiscal year that begins 
in april to about 278 billion or roughly 1 percent of gross 
national product 
the us defense budget is more than 10 times as large and 
consumes 6 percent of gross national product 
japans defense spending has grown rapidly in dollar terms due 
to the yens almost doubling in value since 1985 and now is judged 
thirdbiggest in the world or slightly ahead of britain france and 
west germany 
much of the defense buildup took place in close coordination 
with the united states which by treaty is obliged to help defend 
japan the two countries navies and air forces collaborate on 
defense planning and the japanese have been building up potent air 
and antisubmarine forces 
unlike central europe with its fairly clear divide between two 
superpower camps on the ground the far east is a vast area in 
which control of the sea is a more important factor and there are 
more contenders the soviets china the usjapan alliance and 
powerful smaller countries like vietnam and the koreas 
the asian countries however have bitter memories of japanese 
invasions and have protested tokyos increases in military 
spending 
after world war ii us occupation authorities imposed a 
constutition that bans the use of military force and the armed 
forces have an ambiguous status their existence is justified as 
strictly for selfdefense and japan has not acquired hardware that 
would enable distant military adventures such as longrange 
bombers or aircraft carriers 
but some americans have called for japan to increase defense 
efforts even more to relieve the us military outlay 
president bush recently signed a bill calling on japan to pay 
all the costs of the roughly 50000 us troops stationed in japan 
japan now pays about 45 percent of the support or about 28 
billion a year 
the japanese government has not yet commented on the new call 
from washington

asked who inspired him the most cela said i was inspired by 
all spanish authors before me literature is part of a culture 
he said he best enjoyed reading medieval spanish poets he also 
mentioned the late ernest hemingway as an influence 
hemingway was my friend we went to a lot of bullfights 
together he was a great author and a great friend cela said

crop failure in civil warplagued ethiopia 
threatens up to four million people with a famine worse than the 
mass starvation of five years ago the 24nation organization for 
economic cooperation and development says 
the situation in the coming months risks being more serious 
than in 198485 when 1 million ethiopians starved to death said 
joe wheeler president of the parisbased organizations committee 
for aid and development 
food shortages stemming from crop failure are aggravated by 
difficulties in distributing emergency aid across combat zones in 
northern ethiopia wheeler said tuesday after the committees 
annual meeting on world development aid 
the committee called on the world community to help get aid 
through to hardtoreach regions 
wheeler said several regions controlled by forces opposed to 
ethiopias government are no longer producing enough food to feed 
their populations 
the marxist government must overcome its traditional reluctance 
to open up contact to rebelheld areas if the civilian population 
is to have any chance of surviving 1990 wheeler said 
its often possible to persuade governments to permit certain 
actions for humanitarian reasons he said its essential to 
get food across the lines wheeler said similar problems had been 
overcome in neighboring sudan 
the organization for economic cooperation and developments 
members include all nato nations japan and neutral countries such 
as austria finland and switzerland

as the nations governors try to meet a 
selfimposed deadline for developing national education goals 
leaders of education groups are moving to have some impact on the 
finished product 
keith geiger president of the national education association 
proposed tuesday that federally financed preschool programs for 
poor youngsters integrate nutrition prenatal care and health 
screening 
early childhood education should be the primary focus of the 
nation geiger said in an interview two days before thursdays 
meeting of the education task force of the national governors 
association 
and while preschool was included in its recommendations a 
second education group the council of the great city schools said 
the first priority should be to improve urban schools 
the council said 304 percent of all poor children in the united 
states are enrolled in only 50 urban school systems and the teacher 
shortage in urban schools is 2 times greater than the national 
average 
geiger and council leaders president larry zenke and director 
samuel husk will present their ideas on national performance 
goals for education at the task force meeting the governors group 
has been working since the idea was approved in september at the 
education summit between governors and president bush 
all 50 governors will convene in late february to put on the 
finishing touches 
in a dec 1 letter to the task force cochairmen geiger 
suggested the goals be both ambitious and specific ambitious 
enough to demonstrate that americas leaders understand the depth 
of the problems schools face specific enough to enable americans 
to hold government accountable 
husk said the councils board of directors decided in early 
november to strongly recommend that national goals contain specific 
targets outcomes and measures from each area interim goals to be 
met along the way program and funding strategies at all levels and 
plans for incentives and accountability 
the council of the great city schools is an organization of 45 
urban school districts that concentrates on the concerns of city 
schools 
urban educators have proven their ability to improve our 
schools with limited resources however the time has come for 
governments businesses and our communities to provide the monetary 
resources to support efforts to fulfill our commitment to quality 
education for all children husk said 
no child should be allowed to fall through the cracks 
geiger said every child should arrive at school physically 
intellectually emotionally and socially able to learn 
head start has been touted as the most successful preschool 
program financed by the federal government about 1300 head start 
programs operate around the country providing education and health 
and nutrition services to about 20 percent of the impoverished 
preschoolers who are eligible 
bush recently signed a law to increase spending for the head 
start program this fiscal year by 147 million to 16 billion 
but the nea estimated about 63 billion is needed to serve all 
eligible children ages 3 through 5 
both the nea and council offered similar proposals they want 
incorporated into the national performance goals for example both 
called for safe disciplined and drugfree schools the council 
also suggested there should be specific steps to be taken by 
distillers tobacco and firearms manufacturers to reduce youth 
access to their products 
the groups also called for a reduction in the dropout rate 
the nea proposed providing a fully qualified teacher for every 
classroom with salaries and benefits competitive with other fields 
that require comparable skills preparation and responsibility 
the council suggested the goals target specific number or 
percentages of teachers needed by 2000 to better reflect the racial 
characteristics of students

a relatively high level of cash income is 
expected to put more farmers in the 1990 market for new machinery 
and other capital improvements agriculture department analysts say 
net cash income is expected to be in the range of 52 billion to 
54 billion this year down from a record 599 billion in 1988 
because of higher production expenses and lower government payments 
in 1990 according to projections announced at the departments 
recent outlook conference net cash income the difference between 
cash gross income and cash expenses may be in the range of 52 
billion to 57 billion 
stan g daberkow of the departments economic research service 
said that with 1990 net cash income looking brighter and interest 
rates to remain near current levels capital spending next year 
could rise 4 percent to 5 percent 
prospects for increased planted acreage and an aging farm 
machinery stock may also positively influence capital spending by 
farmers he said 
a sevenyear slump for the farm machinery industry ended in 1986 
unit sales of new farm tractors and other large pieces of farm 
equipment increased in 1987 and 1988 and are likely to show further 
gains in 1989 and 1990 daberkow said sales of new 
over40horsepower tractors may reach 64000 units up from an 
estimated 62000 in 1989 
daberkow said combines did not substantially rebound until this 
year because some farmers had to postpone capital spending because 
of the 1988 drought even so selfpropelled combine sales which 
are closely related to harvest prospects began to rise 
significantly from 1988 levels by april of this year 
the retooling of us agriculture is long overdue between 1980 
and 1986 he said capital expenditures dropped by nearly 60 
percent 
rising real interest rates declining commodity prices 
curtailed agricultural exports reluctance to take on additional 
debt falling land values reduced planted cropland and a binge of 
capital spending in the 1970s led to very conservative levels of 
capital spending in the 1980s daberkow said 
tractors and other farm machinery usually make up about 60 
percent of all capital expenditures with buildings and land 
improvements accounting for 25 percent to 30 percent and cars and 
trucks the remainder 
sales of large new tractors were one of the hardest hit 
categories during the early and mid1980s with the number of units 
sold plummeting 75 percent 
daberkow said farmers may spend between 118 billion and 121 
billion next year on total agricultural supplies or inputs which 
would be down 1 percent to 2 percent from this year that would be 
due in part to lower feed costs

the agriculture department says china has been 
authorized to buy an additional 1 million metric tons of us wheat 
at subsidized prices 
acting undersecretary john b campbell said tuesday that the 
wheat will be available to china under the departments export 
enhancement program or eep a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and 
is equal to 367 bushels of wheat 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the subsidies have averaged from around 10 per ton to more 
than 40 per ton of wheat or in the range of 27 cents to about 
110 per bushel 
campbell said 10000 tons remained in the previous eep 
allocation for china announced feb 27 that allocation was for 2 
million tons 
china was the largest foreign buyer of us wheat in the 198889 
wheat marketing year that ended may 31 with orders for nearly 81 
million tons all of it under the eep program sales for 198990 
total about 47 million tons most of it without subsidies 
china is also the worlds largest wheat producer this year with 
an output estimated at 91 million tons that compares with the 
soviet unions harvest of 89 million tons this year and the us 
production of about 56 million tons

imports of lambs and sheep rose sharply this 
year and are expected to continue rising in 1990 according to 
agriculture department livestock analysts 
imports during the first eight months of 1989 totaled 106676

two liberal voter registration groups that 
took money from charles j keating a central figure in the savings 
and loan scandal have seen contributions dry up officials of the 
organizations say 
sen alan cranston dcalif one of five senators under 
investigation by the senate ethics committee played a role in 
soliciting money from keating for both groups said murray flander 
his spokesman 
one group the forum institute will suspend operations jan 1 
because the links to keating have prompted so much turmoil william 
jeffress the groups lawyer said tuesday 
given all the proceedings given the involvement of cranston 
and keating the board thinks its best they suspend operations on 
jan 1 jeffress said 
the other group the center for participation in democracy 
based in los angeles is not actively soliciting resources 
according to cruz reynoso chairman of the board the centers 
future will be discussed at the next board meeting reynoso said 
reynoso a former california supreme court justice and also a 
member of the forum institutes board said the bad publicity 
surrounding keating has made it very difficult to raise money 
meanwhile the new york times reported today that federal law 
enforcement authorities are investigating whether both groups 
violated their taxexempt status by instructing employees to 
register more democrats than republicans 
cranston denied that in an interview with the times saying 
voter registration drives were carefully done in accordance with 
legal requirements 
keating a phoenix millionaire who headed the american 
continental corp and its subsidiary the lincoln savings and loan 
association contributed 325000 over two years to the institute 
jeffress said 
keating also gave 400000 to the center a group set up by 
cranstons son kim with his fathers help to register new voters 
in western states 
the lincoln failure the subject of numerous federal and state 
investigations is expected to cost taxpayers 25 billion the 
largest single thrift collapse 
the forum institute was created in 1981 by robert stein a 
philanthropist and paid consultant to the democratic party until 
october cranston and stein frequently worked in tandem to raise 
money for voter registration an issue in which both men were 
interested flander said 
flander said cranston who has a personal passion for 
registering new voters traveled around the country raising money 
for his cause including money from keating 
as far as alan is concerned this is a good cause flander 
said adding that cranston first met keating either in 1985 or 1986 
cranston sought money from keating for the forum institute the 
center for participation in democracy and usa votes a project of 
steins company new dimension resources inc flander said 
new dimension paid for more than a dozen trips for cranston to 
travel around the country raising money for voter registration 
drives in 1988 according to cranstons financial disclosure forms 
stein refused in two telephone conversations to answer any 
questions about his involvement with cranston or keating he said 
he wanted the controversy to subside before he talked about his 
projects 
the nonprofit taxexempt forum institute is an organization 
that gives grants to groups that encourage voter participation 
and public education according to records filed by with the 
internal revenue service 
the forum institute raised 21 million in 1988 about 300000 
more than the previous year the groups irs records show among 
the grants the institute handed out were a total of roughly 
305000 in 1987 and 1988 to the center for participation in 
democracy 
the forum institute also gave about 800000 to the organizing 
institute of pacific grove calif a group that trained registrars 
for the center 
other forum grants went for a variety of projects ranging from 
clear air to youth activities 
cranston along with sens dennis deconcini dariz donald 
riegle dmich john glenn dohio and john mccain rariz are 
under investigation by the senate ethics committee for accepting 
campaign contributions from keating while at the same time 
intervening with federal regulators seeking to curb lincolns 
lending practices the senators have denied they did anything 
illegal

barbara bush giving a plug for the salvation 
army as several local shopping malls shut it out this holiday 
season said all shopping centers should welcome the annual bell 
ringers 
it just wouldnt be christmas without that bell ringing the 
first lady said tuesday as she dropped 10 into the salvation army 
kettle inside the entrance to the upscale mazza gallerie mall 
she decided to lend her support when she read a newspaper story 
about a large number of local shopping malls that are excluding the 
annual solicitation on the grounds that they bar all groups from 
soliciting 
i am a great fan of the salvation army so i wanted to come 
out and tell you what great work i think you do mrs bush told 
salvation army volunteer evelyn barnes and col jack waters 
commander of the regional salvation army division 
waters said about a third of the shopping malls in the 
washington metropolitan area bar the annual holiday solicitation by 
the bell ringers about double the rate of refusals in other parts 
of the country 
he said more than 125000 people came to the local salvation 
army for assistance last year and this year already has seen more 
requests 
mrs bush said all shopping malls should allow the salvation 
army to set up its kettles during the christmas season asked what 
message she would give to those who refuse she said she had none 
but wanted only to praise the ones that do cooperate 
im saying this mall is a great mall she told reporters 
i cant possibly think of christmas without the salvation 
army i cant think of disasters without the salvation army she 
said referring to the organizations work for victims of natural 
disasters i cant think of the needy without the salvation 
army 
the organization said that last year it raised 600000 in its 
kettles throughout the capital region and about 10000 of that 
will be lost due to malls that are barring the kettles this year 
after stopping at the salvation army kettle mrs bush did some 
christmas shopping in neimanmarcus department store 
she bought toys and clothes for her grandchildren said her

the soviet union will continue supporting the 
promoscow leader of afghanistan despite president bushs 
insistence at the malta summit that president najibullahs ouster 
would hasten settlement of the war in that country according to 
us officials 
bush described najibullah as unacceptable to usbacked 
moslem guerrillas but soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
he was a national figure who was gaining popularity in the country 
the officials said tuesday 
bush and gorbachev were unable to break new ground at their 
superpower summit to end the conflict between government and moslem 
forces in afghanistan even though the last soviet troops departed 
in february 
the dispute which surfaced in an exchange between bush and 
gorbachev on the soviet cruise ship maxim gorky on sunday stood in 
sharp contrast to the mostly positive results of the shipboard 
meeting 
a parallel disagreement over central america was disclosed by 
bush and gorbachev at a windup news conference sunday 
i cant say there are no differences between us bush told 
reporters without making any direct reference to the war in 
afghanistan 
he stressed their differences over soviet arms supplies to 
leftist rebels in el salvador bush insists antiaircraft missiles 
and other weapons were being delivered by cuba and nicaragua but 
gorbachev said he did not know how the arms got to the farabundo 
marti national liberation front that is at war with the salvadoran 
government us officials told the associated press at the summit 
meeting 
regional conflicts have proved to be the most resistant to 
ussoviet reconciliation by contrast bush and gorbachev set as 
targets arms control accords to limit nuclear conventional and 
chemical weapons 
sibghatullah mojaddedi the head of the usbacked afghan 
resistance met with bush at the white house before the malta 
summit and said he wanted highaltitude antiaircraft weapons to 
use against soviet bombers 
he also expressed hope that bush would tell gorbachev to drop 
soviet support for the puppet regime and the communist 
government in the afghan capital of kabul 
unfortunately the free world thinks that the russians have 
withdrawn completely from afghanistan mojaddedi said still 
the russians are bombing our people the mujahedeen from their own 
territory 
the soviet red army rolled into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
back a marxist government against moslem guerrillas in a war that 
had broken out a year earlier 
the last of the soviet troops were withdrawn in february but 
us intelligence sources claim moscow has increased us aid to 
najibullahs government to 300 million to 400 million a month 
secretary of state james a baker iii at his meeting in jackson 
hole wyo in september with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze complained about the arms shipments 
the soviets responded that the united states by sending the 
guerrillas a reported 500 million in arms annually via pakistan 
was violating the geneva accords signed last year that secured the 
red army withdrawal from afghanistan 
us humanitarian aid to the rebels and refugees in afghanistan 
and pakistan amounts to 130 million a year us officials decline 
to acknowledge on the record that any american arms are being sent 
to the insurgents 
at the summit bush told gorbachev the marxist president must 
relinquish power before there could be a political settlement of 
the war the president told gorbachev that najibullah has to 
go said the us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in another troubled area the middle east the summit talks 
produced no apparent discord 
us officials said gorbachev appealed for a warmer american 
stance toward yasser arafat the chairman of the palestine 
liberation organization and said he had gone out on a limb to 
seek peace with israel 
bush urged gorbachev to understand israels concerns over the 
plo although the two leaders reached no agreement bush concluded 
the soviets were making a positive contribution to efforts to 
resolve the arabisraeli dispute and the war in lebanon

national and state officials of both major 
political parties deny a study groups charge that they pumped 
money exempt from federal regulation into last years presidential 
campaign 
in a report issued tuesday the center for responsive politics 
said republican and democratic parties in nine battleground states 
received 285 million in socalled soft money donations not 
covered by federal limits 
included in the total were contributions of more than 75 
million from the democratic national committee and more than 2 
million from the republican national committee 
anyone can see there was wholesale erosion of our campaign 
finance laws during last years presidential campaign said ellen 
miller executive director of the center a bipartisan group that 
studies campaign finance 
but the parties say the center is taking a onesided view of 
campaign spending 
leslie goodman spokeswoman for the republican national 
committee said the report really ignores the fact that we 
operate on two levels under federal laws and under state laws 
ginny terzano a spokeswoman for the democratic national 
committee said they sort of want to federalize the process 
which is not going to be realistic when you put money into state 
parties thats a state issue and the state has to deal with that 
and they dont want federal involvement 
texas democratic chairman bob slagle contacted in dallas said 
those folks in washington dc are looking through the wrong 
end of the telescope and i dont know if a microscope would help 
slagle said the democratic party in texas which has not been 
carried by a democratic presidential candidate since 1976 is more 
interested in protecting its state and local candidates from a 
republican sweep than in promoting a presidential candidate 
slagles republican counterpart fred meyer said his party uses 
contributions that are exempt from federal limits for research 
recruitment and training of candidates and for administrative 
functions 
but ms miller said the group found obvious patterns of 
questionable soft money giving no wonder voters have so little 
confidence in our politicians when they are sabotaging our laws 
like this 
ms miller said the group concluded soft money was used toward 
the presidential race because 11 individuals and eight businesses 
each contributed more than 100000 in the nine states and 42 
percent of the money came from outofstate sources including the 
two national political parties also much of the money was given 
in key presidential states and about a third of the money was given 
in the last four weeks 
although corporations and labor unions are barred from 
contributing directly to campaigns for federal office and 
individual contributions are limited they may make unlimited 
contributions in most states for state and local campaigns party 
building and voter drives 
this is called soft money and is not supposed to be used in 
campaigns for federal office the center wants such contributions 
brought under federal control 
the study covered 7098 contributions by individuals 
corporations unincorporated businesses trade associations and the 
democratic and republican national committees to state parties in 
california colorado florida illinois missouri pennsylvania 
north carolina texas and washington 
individuals gave 92 million to republican state parties and 
18 million to democratic state parties corporations gave nearly 
65 million almost of a third of it to the republican parties 
soft money contributions to republican parties from all sources 
came to 167 million and to 118 million for democratic parties 
according to the study republicans received more than democrats in 
all states except texas and pennsylvania 
california had the largest infusion of soft money 58 million 
to the republican party and 44 million to the democrats 
other state totals were florida 47 million illinois 44 
million texas 32 million colorado 21 million missouri 
15 million washington just under 1 million pennsylvania 
883000 and north carolina 345286 
the bottom line is we do not go above the law or federal 
election commission regulations when we are putting money into 
states for various races ms terzano said we put our money 
into the state and we use it and the money is directed according 
to fec regulations

top managers of federal agencies believe tens 
of billions of tax dollars are jeopardized by waste fraud and 
shoddy practices according to an inventory of highrisk 
programs compiled by the office of management and budget 
the list is a departmentbydepartment blueprint of costly flaws 
in the way the federal government conducts the peoples business 
it was made public tuesday by sen john glenn dohio chairman of 
the senate governmental affairs committee 
he noted that warnings about the department of housing and urban 
development went unheeded until flaws grew into an estimated 6 
billion crisis and praised budget director richard darman for 
trying to identify programs which could become our next huds 
hes really bringing some of these things to light so that 
well know if there are any more of those hud situations out 
there glenn said 
omb confirmed it gave the list to glenn spokeswoman barbara 
clay said the administration plans to work closely with glenn to 
develop management systems and internal controls sufficient to 
deal with the high risks identified on the list 
the list detailed problems with more than 70 programs among 
them 
the department of defense pays for goods it doesnt receive and 
cant account for or adequately trace 565 billion worth of 
government property thats in the hands of government contractors 
theres a 585 billion difference between the amount of money 
the social security administration records say has been received 
from workers and the amount indicated by internal revenue service 
records 
at the patent and trademark office 189 million documents are 
missing or misfiled 
glenn has been holding a series of hearings on government 
efficiency 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm told 
glenns committee last month that inadequate financial controls 
resulted in the loss of 4 billion at the department of veterans 
affairs more than 10 billion in military sales and loans to 
foreign governments and 12 billion dollars at the commodity credit 
corp 
all of the major agencies have serious problems comptroller 
general charles boucher told the committee unfortunately time 
and time again we find situations where agencies and auditors have 
identified problems yet the corrective actions taken if any are 
ineffective and the problems remain uncorrected for years 
in october darman told the committee the list of risky areas 
was being put together with the intention of devoting significant 
attention to correcting these vulnerabilities over time 
i have instructed omb budget staff to give priority to 
providing resources to needed corrections darman testified 
he also said the problems encountered at hud are not unique 
darman said he asked federal managers to report weaknesses that 
might lead to waste and fraud and their reports showed hud 
wasnt the worst it was in the middle of the pack which leads one 
to worry about any number of other big problems out there 
the 27page list covers the wellpublicized problems at hud and 
at the energy departments nuclear plants and highlights numerous 
others 
the list criticizes the financial controls set up for the 
superfund environmental cleanup program the environmental 
protection agency doesnt log some accounts receivable until 
payments come in and the epas inspector general found 8 million 
of such accounts in one regional office the report said 
the treasury department reported the irs has failed to collect 
more than 63 billion worth of delinquent taxes 
the list also noted department of veterans affairs compensation 
and pension programs have made 53 million in overpayments benefit 
decisions have not always been appropriate or correct the 
document said

the chairman of the house banking committee 
says hearings that led to the resignation of savings and loan 
regulator m danny wall are just the beginning of his 
investigation of the sampl crisis 
wall resigned just two weeks after the committee completed 50 
hours of hearings focusing on the regulators handling of lincoln 
savings and loan association of irvine calif 
lincoln is expected to become the nations biggest sampl failure 
expected to cost taxpayers more than 2 billion 
this is just the beginning rep henry gonzalez dtexas 
said in a telephone interview tuesday from his home in san antonio 
we started with lincoln because its the prototype of 
everything that went wrong 
gonzalez said he may conduct more hearings on lincoln and the 
panel later would explore other sampl failures including silverado 
banking savings and loan association in denver colo 
the silverado case is politically sensitive because president 
bushs son neil bush served on silverados board of directors 
gonzalez said the committee will concentrate on the 
constitutional question of how in 1988 walls agency without 
specific congressional authorization was able to commit the 
government to spending 40 billion on sampl rescues the panel also 
will explore whether the fbi should have more vigorously pursued 
shady sampl executives 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater avoided questions about 
whether the president or his top aides wanted wall to quit 
he resigned and it will be accepted he said 
under legislation enacted in august the director of the thrift 
office serves a fiveyear term and must be confirmed by the senate 
which returns from holiday recess next month 
according to an industry source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity treasury officials who oversee walls agency favor 
appointing an experienced regulator to succeed wall early 
speculation is centered on several officials who have worked for 
either the federal reserve system or the federal deposit insurance 
corp 
neither wall nor his immediate predecessor edwin gray had 
regulatory experience wall had served as staff director of the 
senate banking committee under sen jake garn rutah gray was a 
former public relations executive and press secretary to ronald 
reagans 1980 campaign 
rep jim leach riowa a member of the house banking committee 
said the new thrift regulator has to be able to stand up to 
powerful interests within the industry on capitol hill and 
frankly within the administration hes got to be able to 
inspire public confidence 
you need someone who does not come out of the political 
environment as wall did rather you need a tough experienced 
regulator who has a long history in banking regulation and knows 
the ins and outs of the industry said rep charles schumer 
dny also a banking panel member 
wall in a news conference announcing his resignation monday 
defended his record and said gonzalez resorted to corruption of 
the truth and abandonment of our historical devotion to fair play 
gonzalez dismissed walls complaint tuesday 
down here in texas we know that when a skunk is frightened 
and retreating that is when he is spraying the hardest 
the committee chairman also rejected complaints his intense 
criticism of wall had made it all but impossible for the 
administration to find someone else willing step into the cross 
fire 
watergate didnt deter people from running for the 
presidency he said 
meanwhile us district court judge stanley sporkin in 
washington was preparing to hear arguments thursday in a lawsuit 
challenging the federal takeover of lincoln 
among the witnesses subpoenaed are charles h keating jr 
chairman of american continental corp lincolns parent company 
leonard bickwit an attorney for american continental declined 
tuesday to indicate whether keating would testify or assert his 
fifth amendment right against selfincrimination 
keating is the subject of a federal grand jury probe in los 
angeles and the target of a 11 billion federal fraud and 
racketeering suit 
among the 11 individual defendants in the fraud suit is 
keatings brother william j keating a former twoterm republican 
member of congress who is chief executive officer of the detroit 
newspaper agency and chairman of the board of directors of the 
associated press 
william keating is not accused of fraud or racketeering but is 
named in three of 15 counts and is accused of negligence and breach 
of fiduciary duty 
william keating who served on the american continental board 
has said he attended only two board meetings his lawyer chester 
kamin has said he was seeking to have william keatings name 
removed from the governments suit 
william keating on tuesday declined to comment on the suit 
saying as long as this matter is in litigation im not really 
able to discuss that

federal health officials say laboratory 
findings that very high doses of the antiaids drug azt cause 
tumors in aging laboratory rodents should cause little concern for 
people with aids 
dr james mason the top health official at the department of 
health and human services said that while the results are 
significant they do not show azt causes cancer in humans 
the public health service still strongly recommends that aids 
patients continue their zidovudine azt therapy under 
consultation with their physicians mason said tuesday 
dan hoth director of the aids division at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases noted in the study 
conducted by the maker of azt burroughs wellcome co the rodents 
received much higher doses of azt for a much longer time than aids 
patients do 
we know that azt prolongs life in humans with aids he 
said when you compare that known benefit of azt to the 
theoretical risk of tumors the only right thing to do is to 
continue using azt 
azt is the only drug approved by the food and drug 
administration that attacks the aids virus directly it was 
approved in march 1987 
more than 40000 aids patients take azt in the united states no 
one is known to have recovered from aids 
burroughs wellcome co sent notice to physicians informing them 
of the studys findings that some of the rats and mice that 
received very high doses of azt for most of their normal life spans 
developed vaginal tumors at the end of their lives 
the results the company said are of limited predictive value 
for humans 
though the results raise the possibility of a carcinogenic 
potential in general they should not be interpreted as applying 
only to the vagina or to women said company spokeswoman kathy 
bartlett 
the company said in its study that high doses of azt were given 
to 360 female rats and mice for about 22 months almost their 
entire normal life span the test rodents were divided into three 
groups and each given different doses of the drug 
of the 120 receiving the highest dose seven developed cancerous 
vaginal tumors and two had benign vaginal tumors burroughs 
wellcome said one benign tumor was found in the group receiving 
the middle dose while no treatmentrelated tumors were seen at the 
lowest dose the company said 
the company said no treatmentrelated tumors were observed in an 
equal number of male rodents 
tumors in rodents were observed on laboratory examination 
toward the end of their lifespan and only in animals which had 
received very high doses of zidovudine said the company based 
in research triangle park nc 
burroughs wellcomes studies were part of routine tests that are 
carried out on new drugs and take about three years to conduct the 
company said

from engaging mikhail gorbachev in the stormy 
med to taking egyptian president hosni mubarak to the ballpark or 
picking up the phone for a chat with the pope president bushs 
brand of diplomacy is personal and nonstop 
bush has traveled to 14 countries as president and according 
to white house statisticians he has held 105 separate oneonone 
meetings with presidents prime ministers and kings 
just home from his meeting with the soviet leader at malta and 
with nato allies in brussels bush is getting ready to embark on 
yet another foreign trip a meeting next week with french 
president francois mitterrand on the caribbean island of st martin 
true to bushs whirlwind style hell squeeze that trip into one 
day leaving washington early in the morning and returning late at 
night 
those leaders bush cant get around to meeting this year hell 
just have to phone or meet next year 
so far on the 1990 calendar theres a drug summit in latin 
america in february an expected trip to australia and one to 
africa being considered a 23nation summit in vienna to sign an 
arms treaty has been proposed by bush and at some point theres 
bound to be a moscow summit 
bush conducts diplomacy like he plays golf he rushes from one 
event to the next when he isnt personally entertaining them hes 
reaching out to touch world leaders by phone 
in the days before his waterlogged summit with gorbachev bush 
met with british prime minister margaret thatcher and canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney and called the other 13 nato allies 
by phone according to press spokesman bob hall he also called the 
leaders of japan korea and israel to discuss the summit 
to discuss the issue of us hostages being held in lebanon 
bush made a transatlantic phone call to pope john paul ii last 
summer bush met the pope during a visit to italy in may 
bush works quickly to try to establish a personal rapport with 
world leaders he took mrs thatcher for a ride in a golf cart 
escorted mitterrand through the woods and over the rocks at his 
oceanfront home in maine and took a somewhat bewildered mubarak by 
presidential helicopter to a baltimore orioles baseball game 
he has invited mrs thatcher prince charles and mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari to the presidential retreat at 
camp david md 
he persuaded danish prime minister poul schlueter and his wife 
to visit him in kennebunkport maine on their honeymoon visit to 
the united states 
and he showed off the smithsonians air and space museum to 
jordans king hussein 
he has used the personal touch much more than most past 
presidents said deputy press secretary alixe glen 
even though the summit with gorbachev was curtailed and 
logistics disrupted by a fierce storm the two met long enough for 
secretary of state james a baker iii to declare theres a 
potential for real chemistry here between these two leaders 
of his meeting with gorbachev bush said the emotional part 
of it is hard to describe for me because im not the most 
articulate emotionalist but i just cant have asked for a better 
ambiance a better feel from the meetings even though the 
differences are acute in some areas 
gennadi gerasimov the soviet spokesman paid bush an indirect 
compliment suggesting he was far better prepared than former 
president reagan gerasimov joked that bush had left his thick 
reference book somewhere else i guess on another ship 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution who 
specializes in the presidency said bushs ability to establish 
personal relationships with world leaders turns out to be 
extremely useful 
the agenda of the world is involving the american president 
very deeply and probably will for the rest of bushs term hess 
said 
anyway hess added even though bush claimed he wanted to be the 
education president what he really wanted to be all along was 
the internationalaffairs president

the number of reported cases of a sometimes 
fatal blood disorder linked to the nutritional supplement 
ltryptophan is up to 720 federal health officials say 
while the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
continues to investigate cases reported by state health 
departments the food and drug administration is testing samples of 
the substance and making sure it remains off store shelves and 
stopped in us ports 
as of tuesday 720 cases from 48 states the district of 
columbia and puerto rico had been reported to the cdc one death 
has been reported and others are being investigated 
only alaska and south dakota have reported no cases 
the cdc has established a link between the nutritional 
supplement and eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome which is marked by 
severe muscle and joint pain swelling of the arms and legs skin 
rash and sometimes fever 
ltryptophan an amino acid is found naturally in many foods 
some people take supplements of ltryptophan to treat 
sleeplessness depression premenstrual syndrome stress and other 
problems 
the food and drug administration said it has been detaining all 
ltryptophan shipments including bulk supplies of the supplement 
at us ports as a followup to its nov 17 request for a 
nationwide recall of ltryptophan tablets capsules and caplets 
the investigation has not established whether ltryptophan 
itself or some contaminant introduced during manufacture or 
distribution is causing the syndrome the fda said it has collected 
several hundred products and has begun to analyze them for possible 
evidence of chemical or microbial contamination 
fda investigators recently visited ltryptophan manufacturing 
plants in japan a leading supplier of the supplement to us 
manufacturers japanese officials have been cooperating with 
american investigators the fda said 
the cdcs initial analysis of data on 85 cases shows most of 
those who developed the syndrome were women taking between 1 and 2 
grams per day of ltryptophan the fda said the daily intake of 
the supplement ranged from 150 milligrams to 18 grams

a native of thomaston conn and a former seattle resident ms 
casolo has represented christian educational seminars in el 
salvador for nearly five years the san antoniobased organization

fighting a 10yearold war against a succession of usbacked 
governments and last month turned the capital into a combat zone 
with their largest offensive ever 
ms casolo says she knows nothing of the more than 20000 rounds 
of assault rifle ammunition explosives and detonator caps police 
say they found buried behind her house on nov 25 she rented the 
house three months ago she says and has been traveling much of 
the time since then 
members of the military and the rightist administration of 
president alfredo cristiani have accused clergy and church workers 
of sympathizing with and even aiding the rebels 
during last months offensive six jesuit priests were murdered 
during a nighttime curfew by men said by a witness to have been in 
uniform elements connected to the military are widely believed to 
be responsible 
former us attorney general ramsey clark who came to help in 
ms casolos defense says deportation is probably the easiest way 
out for her but ms casolo says she wants to face the charges 
the accusations against me are false she told reporters 
tuesday this is a first step and the rest will be decided by the 
long judicial process here

help with the trial he said he believed her chances for acquittal 
were good

mistake and vowed to continue his efforts to win her release

despite a country in chaos east german 
leaders have managed to make more diplomatic breakthroughs with 
west germany in the last two days than in the last two decades 
a planned summit the establishment of a hard currency fund for 
tourists and agreements on trade transportation and the 
environment all have defied the turbulence at the top 
the accomplishments testify both to the stubborn resolve of 
those communists still in power to keep the country working and to 
west germanys decision to act quickly while east germany is 
overwhelmed by events 
two east german communist leaderships have fallen in less than 
two months so one might expect the wheels of government and 
diplomacy to have slowed 
but in east germanys case the tumult has actually accelerated 
an orderly effort to close gaps and work together on projects of 
mutual interest 
under the terms of an agreement reached between the two germanys 
on tuesday west german chancellor helmut kohl will visit east 
germany on dec 19 
kohl will meet communist premier hans modrow in dresden rather 
than in the capital of east berlin to avoid de facto recognition 
of the sovereignty of east germany 
the west german leaders refusal to travel to east berlin was a 
condition that erich honecker who led east germany for 18 years 
until his midoctober ouster found unacceptable 
kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters met with modrow on 
tuesday in talks that made progress in a broad array of issues 
concerning both states 
seiters and modrow issued a joint account of their talks 
describing them as productive and businesslike and ticking off an 
impressive list of accomplishments 
the thorniest issue settled was providing east german tourists 
with convertible currency for trips to the west 
west germany has traditionally offered 100mark gifts about 
54 of welcome money to east german arrivals once each year 
because east germany only would convert the equivalent of 8 a day 
for travelers 
seiters announced that the west german budget for welcome money 
next year 405 million was being handed over to east berlin to 
contribute to a hardcurrency pool for tourists 
modrow explained that under the agreement east german adults 
will be entitled to receive up to 108 per year in hard currency 
and parents can receive another 100 west german marks for each 
child under 14 
east germany in turn has agreed to drop a mandatory exchange 
rule that required west germans visiting the communist state to 
convert to east german marks at an unfavorable rate at least 
1350 for each day they were in the country 
west germans also will no longer need visas to enter east 
germany after jan 1 when the new currency exchange system also 
takes effect 
the governments further agreed to study transit improvements 
between their states and bonn promised to help east germany upgrade 
its outmoded and overwhelmed telephone network 
agreements were reached on joint efforts to improve 
environmental protection in east germany one of europes most 
polluted nations expanded rail links between the countries also is 
to be explored 
modrow also said east germany would boost its trade with west 
germany by 162 million next year 
kohl told reporters in brussels belgium on monday that he 
planned to follow through on his intent to visit east germany 
before christmas despite the resignation sunday of communist party 
chief egon krenz the full party politburo and the 163member 
central committee 
i will meet with premier modrow and whoever is elected party 
leader at the special congress he said at a press conference 
following the gathering of nato leaders 
a special party congress is set for dec 1517 at which a new 
leadership is to be named in the interim a 25person panel is 
running party affairs and modrow as government leader is empowered 
to handle diplomatic affairs 
the communists face widespread opposition both from grassroots 
movements that want a share of power and from several small parties 
that used to vote with the communists as a bloc but now are 
exercising relative independence 
kohl has unveiled a 10point plan for improving ties with east 
germany that aims at eventual reunification and he drew some 
support for the endeavor from president bush at the nato meeting 
west germany may be intensifying its contacts with east germany 
in the absence of a clear party leadership in belief that the 
government structure which includes 11 noncommunist ministers is 
more capable than the communist hierarchy of entering into 
agreements that the public will support 
modrow is a member of the communist party but has long 
advocated democratic changes and enjoys more support among east 
germans than any other party figure

while changes in the earths climate threaten 
to encourage the spread of diseases like rabies the changes may 
also damage the human bodys ability to fight them health 
officials are warning 
a conference on global atmospheric change and public health 
was told tuesday that potential problems stem both from the 
increase in ultraviolet radiation as the protective ozone layer in 
the stratosphere is damaged and from climate warming which many 
scientists believe is occurring in a socalled greenhouse effect 
ultraviolet radiation already known to cause skin cancer also 
has a major effect in reducing the response of the human immune 
system said dr raymond daynes of the university of utah 
at the same time the immune system damage is being threatened 
warming of the climate could lead to the spread of diseases 
currently limited by the climate said dr robert e shope of the

more land in nevada would be protected from 
development timber harvesting and mineral exploration under 
legislation that has been signed into law by president bush 
the measure signed tuesday creates 733400 acres of protected 
wilderness in nevada and opens another 24 million acres to 
multiple use under the management of the agriculture department 
the legislation puts a total of 2 percent of the states land 
under wilderness protection preventing development and such uses 
as timber harvesting mineral exploration or intrusion by campers 
in vehicles 
however the legislation protects existing grazing rights for 
ranchers on the wilderness land and lowlevel military flights

declared a state of national emergency throughout the philippines 
mrs aquino issued the proclamation on the sixth day of the most 
serious armed bid to topple her nearly 4yearold government 
upon my directive appropriate emergency measures shall 
henceforth be strictly carried out by the duly authorized head of

aquino had turned down recommendations from some cabinet members 
that she declare a state of emergency to cope with the military 
uprising

continued to hold manilas financial district and another 400 held 
a military base on cebu island

the link between faith and politics is being tested as the 
threat of ecclesiastical sanctions hangs over roman catholic 
officials targeted in a special appeal by the nations bishops to 
restrict legalized abortion 
a california legislator banned from communion for advocating 
abortion rights held a narrow lead in a special election tuesday 
but catholic politicians everywhere are feeling the heat of an 
aggressive church hierarchy that has banned dissent on abortion 
among its 53million members 
im not as interested in getting reelected as i am getting 
into heaven said state sen john amari of birmingham ala 
some catholic lawmakers noting the struggles of their 
predecessors such as al smith and john f kennedy against 
historical prejudices that they were surrogates for the vatican 
say the bishops are out of line 
the church has control over my moral life it doesnt have 
control over my political life said assembly speakerelect 
joseph doria in new jersey 
with the us supreme court opening the way for the states to 
impose restrictions on abortion in its ruling in a missouri case 
the bishops last month plunged into the debate by calling abortion 
the fundamental human rights issue 
they also said catholic legislators have a special moral 
responsibility to work to curtail abortion 
the bishops did not take a stand on whether penalties should be 
imposed but several catholic leaders said the church should 
discuss the possibility and action has been taken in some dioceses 
lucy killea who clung to a 1500vote lead today in a special 
election for the california senate was barred by san diego bishop 
leo t maher from receiving communion because of her abortion 
rights commercials 
the bishop had an incredible impact on this race said 
killeas gop opponent assemblywoman carol bentley in one 
letter he created an instant international celebrity and a 
martyr 
montanas bishops have asked catholic politicians not to 
publicly contradict the church on abortion and two officials who 
spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet 
in providence ri the diocesan newspaper told politicians 
they had to sign a declaration supporting a constitutional 
amendment against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday 
greetings 
many catholic politicians are wondering if the sword of church 
sanctions would fall on their heads 
people have been waiting to see if the church is going to come 
along with a sledgehammer to get catholic politicians in line 
said j alan davitt a lobbyist for the catholic church in albany 
ny 
as have many leaders of the abortion rights movement the 
bishops said the supreme court ruling permitting legislative action 
strips the credibility of the im personally opposed but 
reasoning 
philadelphia archbishop anthony j bevilacqua said neither 
politicians nor the public can have a double conscience on 
abortion 
but many catholic politicians still adhere to the policy 
articulated in 1984 by new york gov mario cuomo in defense of vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro that public morality is a 
matter of prudential political judgment 
i personally oppose abortion but before i commit to anything 
im going to do a survey said state rep edward sandoval of new 
mexico 
some said the bishops hardline stand will influence the public 
policy debate on abortion 
a lot of my constituents are catholics they are influenced by 
what the bishops say as they should be and as i should be said 
state sen mike egan of atlanta 
but many predicted the prelates stand would backfire 
its a complete misreading of america and our representative 
form of government said state rep margarita prentiss a seattle 
democrat and abortion rights advocate representatives are not 
elected to represent their religious faith they are elected to 
represent their constituents 
but the prelates were unanimous in their defense of the right of 
the church to enter into the debate and even for individual 
bishops to administer sanctions 
the question of churchstate relationship and separation is a 
long and complex one it is noxious to apply that principle if the 
intent is to isolate the church from public discussion in regard to 
public policy said archbishop john r roach of the archdiocese 
of st paul and minneapolis 
some politicians agreed 
when we talk about the first amendment we forget the first 
part free exercise of religion said state senate president pro 
tempore david roberti of california with the catholic church 
people generally emphasize the separation of church and state and 
not the free exercise of religion there is the right of even 
bishops and clergy to have free speech

a rocketry scientist convicted of 
trying to ship sophisticated us missile technology to egypt has 
been sentenced to 46 months in prison 
abdelkader helmy 41 also was fined 358690 and ordered to 
forfeit about a halfmillion dollars all part of what prosecutors 
said were 1 million in payments dispensed to helmy by egyptian 
intelligence operatives via swiss banks 
this is not a cloakanddagger espionage case us district 
judge raul ramirez said at tuesdays sentencing this was a case 
to put it bluntly of greed he thought he would make a lot of 
money and thought he would make a favor befall the sovereign nation 
of egypt 
ramirez also credited helmy for the 18 months he spent in jail 
awaiting trial 
the egyptianborn us citizen pleaded guilty in june to one 
count of illegally exporting about 420 pounds of a carbonbased 
material used in the construction of nose cones rocket nozzles and 
other weaponsrelated machinery eleven counts including money 
laundering and conspiracy were dropped in return for the plea and 
his promise to cooperate with prosecutors 
i would like you to consider me as a human being helmy told 
the judge and human beings make mistakes the united states is 
my country and i never intended to hurt it 
the material called carboncarbon had been developed in the 
united states it has a low visibility to radar and is heat 
resistant it is used extensively in stealth aircraft missiles and 
rockets 
carboncarbon is on the federal governments restricted list 
and its export requires a special license 
an associate of helmys 47yearold james huffman of lexington 
ohio was sentenced to 41 months in prison and fined 7500 
ramirez said huffman who worked as a representative of the 
hollisterbased teledyne corp reportedly used his expertise as a 
20year veteran marketing specialist to help helmy in the exporting 
scheme 
ramirez characterized the export scheme as a large complex 
intricate conspiracy developed by the egyptians with financial 
backing from iraq to get sensitive weaponsgrade rocket materials 
he said that had the conspiracy succeeded and the technology and 
materials reached the middle east egypt and iraq had planned to 
split the fruits of the scheme 
an attorney for helmy marcus s topel had claimed his client 
was recruited by egypts thendefense minister lt gen 
abdelhalim abughazala 
us prosectors said two egyptian nationals also have been 
charged in the case they are ahmed hussam aldin khairat an 
egyptian army officer who allegedly supervised the export scheme 
from a headquarters in austria and fuad algamal an egyptian 
colonel both are fugitives 
the federal grand jury indictment also linked two other 
egyptians to the plot assistant military attache abd elrahin 
elgohary and egyptian col mohamed abdalla mohamed both men who 
had been based in washington dc claimed diplomatic immunity and 
were not charged 
helmy was a top propulsion scientist at aerojet general corp 
near sacramento 
helmy and huffman were arrested in 1988 after us customs 
agents seized a load of carbon material and other goods from an 
aircraft waiting to take off for egypt from baltimorewashington

the soviet union has warned west germany not to 
take advantage of the political upheaval in the east bloc by 
pushing too quickly for reunification with east germany 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany met with 
mikhail s gorbachev and with his soviet counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze on tuesday to discuss a topic that was once 
considered taboo between east and west 
afterward the official tass news agency quoted shevardnadze as 
recalling the soviets experience with a strong germany during 
world war ii it said he told genscher that propaganda about a 
federation of the two germanys can only exacerbate turmoil in the 
current circumstances 
an attempt to use difficulties in the reconstruction process 
in socialist countries for onesided selfish goals without taking 
into account the longterm general european interests can threaten 
the accumulated positive developments stability and peace on the 
continent shevardnadze said 
at the weekend superpower summit in malta gorbachev cautioned 
president bush that a swift push toward reunification could create 
tensions 
genscher told a news conference he assured gorbachev that both 
germanys will keep in mind their responsibility for the security 
of the whole of europe 
shevardnadze told genscher the current developments touch on 
deeprooted interests of the soviet union the countries of the 
warsaw pact and finally all europeans 
the soviet people well remember history and the tragic lesson 
of the second world war he said 
gorbachev in recent weeks has tempered his previous clear 
opposition to reunification of west with east germany where public 
unrest has toppled two governments in six weeks and acclerated 
reform to a breakneck pace 
west german chancellor helmut kohl recently outlined a detailed 
plan for reunification 
while objecting to any immediate call for reunification 
gorbachev has indicated a willingness to let history decide 
tass said monday that despite the acuteness of the problem 
the soviet union is prepared to discuss it in the spirit of new 
thinking presupposing respect for the stand of the other 
but according to tass shevardnadzes side of the discussion 
that resulted was strongly worded he said some of the 10 points in 
kohls reunification plan sounded like orders to east germany 
demanding irreversible changes in its political and economic 
system 
a separate tass report on gorbachevs comment to genscher was 
far milder gorbachev said that under the present circumstances of 
rapid change in europe and improving relations between east and 
west it is especially important to support international 
stability and to strengthen security tass reported 
this suggests selfrestraint responsibility and deliberation 
in actions from all states and loyal cooperation on the basis of 
generally accepted principles tass added paraphrasing gorbachev 
genscher told reporters that he assured gorbachev there is 
not going to be a separate german course 
he said german rapprochement will occur only within general 
european rapprochement and we will do everything to create 
stable cooperative structures to ensure the security of europe 
genscher refused to discuss gorbachevs response 
tass also said that genscher and shevardnadze shared their 
desires to reach agreements on the reduction of strategic offensive 
weapons and conventional armed forces and on a ban on chemical 
weapons

an eightyear study of 10000 mormons 
suggests that people who exercise regularly and dont smoke live 
longer healthier lives 
dr james enstrom who studied the habits of religiously active 
mormons in california said his research shows those who follow the 
churchs teachings against using tobacco and who exercise and get 
seven to eight hours sleep a night are far healthier than people in 
the general white population 
we knew from previous studies of mormon death records that 
this population has an unusually low cancer mortality rate that is 
only partially explained by their lack of smoking said enstrom 
of the university of california los angeles the current study 
allowed us to follow a large group of active mormons over a long 
period of time and to examine subgroups adhering to specific health 
habits 
the study examined three general health habits never smoking 
cigarettes regular physical exercise and regular sleep 
the males involved in the study were all high priests the 
highest lay position in the church of jesus christ of latterday 
saints the women were wives of high priests 
that particular group was selected enstrom said because its 
members would be more likely than other mormons to strictly adhere 
to church doctrine banning alcohol tobacco and caffeine use 
the study found that middleage high priests who didnt smoke 
and who exercised and slept well had 34 percent the rate of cancer 
mortality as middledaged white men in the united states the high 
priests also had only 14 percent the rate of cardiovascular disease 
mortality and 22 percent the rate of overall mortality enstrom said 
middleage wives of high priests who followed the same health 
habits had only a 55 percent rate of cancer death compared to 
middleaged white women enstrom said they had a 34 percent rate 
of cardiovascular disease mortality and a 47 percent rate of 
overall mortality 
further a 25yearold high priest can expect to live to age 85 
compared with a life expectancy of 74 for 25yearold white males 
enstrom said 
a 25yearold high priest wife has a life expectancy of 86 
years compared with 80 for other white 25yearold females 
enstrom said 
the results of the survey conducted at the ucla school of 
public health were to be published in the december issue of the 
journal of the national cancer institute

a teenager charged in the slaying of actress 
rebecca schaeffer was ordered to stand trial for murder after 
testimony from witnesses that included chilling graphic accounts 
of her killing 
municipal judge david horwitz ordered the trial after a daylong 
preliminary hearing tuesday into the death of the young woman who 
starred in the old television series my sister sam 
robert john bardo 19 of tucson ariz appeared groggy as he 
came and went from the courtroom public defender stephen galindo 
said he believed his client was on medication 
the judge upheld a special circumstances charge lying in wait 
that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty if bardo 
is convicted of firstdegree murder bardo will be arraigned dec 
11 
prosecutors allege bardo was the gunman who walked up to miss 
schaeffers apartment house on july 18 and opened fire when she 
came to the door the 21yearold actress was struck once in the 
chest and died 
among the witnesses was miss schaeffers nextdoor neighbor 
actress lynne marta who revealed that the intercoms in the 
apartment house were broken when miss schaeffer responded to the 
door buzzer by opening the security door 
she said the young woman could not have talked to the person at 
the door to find out who was there 
i heard her pass my door ms marta said in what seemed 
like a second there was a blast that sounded like a cannon the 
door shook the wall shook and the cat went up in the air i fell 
down on the floor 
asked what happened next the witness in tears said i heard 
rebeccas first scream i got to the phone and dialed 911 
rebecca was moaning and wailing by the time i got to the door 
i opened the little window hatch in the door and there was a 
smell i will never forget as long as i live it was the smell of 
gunfire and it was quiet except for this little moaning 
ms marta said she stepped into the hallway and called miss 
schaeffers name but no response came she said she stayed there 
until paramedics arrived 
other witnesses told how bardo spent three hours before the 
attack clutching miss schaeffers picture to his chest and stalking 
her neighborhood in search of her apartment 
bardo had gotten her address from a private detective agency a 
witness said 
in quick succession five witnesses identified bardo as the 
young man who stalked miss schaeffer and was seen running away from 
her house moments after gunshots and a scream shattered the calm of 
the quiet neighborhood about 1030 am

scientists say they have detected a bloodcell 
defect in people with parkinsons disease a link that could help 
identify victims before symptoms appear 
such timely identification could open the door for earlier 
treatment of the disease that afflicts 400000 americans 
the findings published tuesday in the annals of neurology are 
the product of federally funded research by dr william davis 
parker jr dr sally j boyson and janice k parks of the 
university of colorado health sciences center 
parkinsons is a neurological condition characterized by 
gradually worsening tremors muscle rigidity and weakness 
symptoms blamed on the disappearance of key brain cells 
the scientists reported finding what appears to be an enzyme 
deficiency inside blood cells of parkinsons patients suggesting 
the disease affects more than just the brain cells it kills 
in normal cells the enzyme is used to neutralize socalled free 
radicals the byproducts of oxidation free radicals have been 
shown in previous research to be capable of killing the same 
brain cells destroyed in parkinsons disease 
scientists cautioned that the new conclusions offer no immediate 
help for people with parkinsons 
but the rewards of nailing down the origins of parkinsons would 
be enormous 
it sounds really exciting to me said dr stanley fahn of 
new yorks columbiapresbyterian medical center 
weve got to be cautious added fahn who last month 
coauthored the results of nationwide trials on the promising 
antiparkinsons drug deprenyl 
it certainly is a new direction no one has ever found a 
defect like this before he said

up to four more active ice volcanoes on 
neptunes moon triton were discovered in snapshots taken by voyager 
2 which found the planet itself is swept by 1500 mph winds the 
fastest yet seen in the solar system 
because the spacecraft photographed at least two and possibly 
five of the geyserlike volcanoes erupting on only a portion of 
triton chances are that there are a dozen of these things going 
off globally at any time said torrence johnson a planetary 
scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
confirmation of the first active volcano was announced oct 2 
after scientists analyzed photos voyager 2 snapped during its aug 
2425 flight past neptune and triton 
detection of more such volcanoes which spew nitrogen ice and 
gas 5 miles high and 90 miles downwind was announced tuesday 
during a news conference at the american geophysical unions fall 
meeting 
triton is only the third world in the solar system known to have 
active volcanism the others are earth and jupiters moon io which 
has sulfurspewing volcanoes scientists suspect there are 
volcanoes on cloudshrouded venus 
neptunes jetstream winds push frozen clouds of natural gas 
past the north edge of the planets earthsize hurricanelike 
great dark spot at nearly 1500 mph voyager project scientist 
edward stone told reporters thats about the speed of sound in 
neptunes atmosphere 
these are the fastest weve observed easily exceeding the 
previous record winds of 1100 mph in saturns jet stream stone 
said these almost may be supersonic winds a wind which is 
mach 1 
the speed of sound on earth is about 700 mph depending on 
temperature and altitude its much faster on planets with colder 
atmospheres containing gases lighter than those in earths air 
the clouds racing in neptunes winds could be seen in a movie 
made by computer from still photographs taken by voyager also 
shown at tuesdays news conference was another computer movie 
clearly showing two of the dark volcanic plumes on triton 
neptunes largest moon and the coldest known object in the solar 
system 
the plumes rise like columns each forming a cloud that drifts 
back and forth as it is blown downwind a shadow cast by one cloud 
also is visible 
the movie also shows what scientists suspect are two or three 
more plumes johnson said 
when voyager swept past triton early aug 25 scientists saw 
streaks on dark material deposited on the moons surface by what 
they believed were active nitrogenice volcanoes 
the national aeronautics and space administration announced it 
was sure there was one active volcano after conducting stereoscopic 
analysis of the photos 
but the images were so fuzzy you had to take our word for 
it johnson said 
so nasa used a computer to overlap still photos taken from 
different angles and replay them in sequence repeatedly the 
resulting movie revealed additional volcanic plumes 
the causes of tritons nitrogen ice volcanoes and neptunes high 
winds are mysterious 
stone described one theory on the volcanoes darker material 
settles on the moons surface then is covered by transparent 
nitrogen ice sunlight penetrates the ice and warms the darker 
material beneath but the heat cannot escape through the ice so 
some of the buried ice melts into gas causing pressure to build 
until the gas erupts upward through cracks carrying ice and dark 
material with it 
neptune gets 900 times less sunlight than earth scientists are 
perplexed about how the internal heat left over from neptunes 
formation is enough to drive 700mph winds in the great dark spot 
not to mention the 1500mph jet stream winds blowing between 15 
and 20 degrees south latitude stone said 
part of the explanation may be that the flow of fluid gases in 
the planets atmosphere may be so smooth that little energy is 
needed to power high winds he said 
voyager 2s neptunetriton exploration capped a 12year mission 
in which it flew past jupiter saturn and uranus the spacecraft 
discovered six moons at neptune bringing the total to eight and 
found several rings of debris orbiting the planet which is 30 
times farther from the sun than earth

a woman dubbed robin hud for her claims she 
purchased cars and housing for the needy with stolen federal 
housing money has pleaded innocent to embezzlement charges 
former escrow agent marilyn harrell pleaded innocent in us 
district court tuesday to charges she embezzled millions of dollars 
from the federal department of housing and urban development 
her attorney public defender anthony gallagher said the 
innocent pleas mean a total denial of all allegations in the 
indictment he refused to comment further 
harrell 46 did not make any statement during or after her 
arraignment she remains free on her own recognizance pending a 
trial next month 
she is accused of embezzling 56 million from hud making false 
statements to the federal government and making false statements in 
connection with a loan application she is one of a dozen escrow 
agents suspected of keeping more than 10 million they were 
supposed to transfer to hud 
us attorney general dick thornburgh has said the case 
represents perhaps the largest single theft of government funds 
ever charged against an individual 
harrell testified before congress last summer during six months 
of hearings into allegations of fraud mismanagement and political 
favoritism at hud during the reagan administration 
she admitted stealing millions and buying 20 homes and nearly 40 
automobiles for the needy before anyone noticed earning her the 
robin hud nickname 
several top officials in huds washington field office to which 
harrell reported were fired because of her case and other 
allegations of mismanagement 
two weeks after harrell testified hud seized her house in 
temple hills a maryland suburb of washington the agency also 
confiscated several other properties harrell said she purchased 
with hud money to help charities and homeless families harrell is 
living with her mother in fort washington also a washington suburb 
as an escrow agent harrell collected money from the sales of 
property that had been foreclosed on by the federal housing 
administration the properties originally had been purchased with 
hudguaranteed loans 
agents such as harrell earn small commissions for handling the 
foreclosures and turn over sales proceeds to the government 
harrell told congress that in 1985 she used sales proceeds to cover 
a 37000 shortfall in her business 
she said that when several months passed without an inquiry from 
hud she concluded the department was so poorly run that it was 
unable to track the millions of dollars in payments due from escrow 
agents

two missiles were fired at the 
home of the spanish ambassador causing some damage but no 
injuries police said it was the fourth attack against spanish 
targets in six weeks 
two windows of the 18thcentury building at the hagues stately 
embassy row were shattered by what appeared to be rocketpropelled 
grenades according to police spokesman nico laterveer 
but the grenades apparently failed to explode said laterveer 
adding that the damage to the residences interior was minimal 
he did not know whether ambassador manuel maria sassot canadas was 
present at the time of the attack 
the residence is about 25 yards from the spanish embassy 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility 
earlier reports indicated heavier damage an explosion heard at 
the time of the attack was believed to have been caused by the 
firing mechanism of the grenades laterveer said 
dutch army explosives experts were carefully searching a gray 
mazda van parked in front of the building from which the missiles 
could have been fired laterveer said 
immediately after the explosion a small fire broke out in 
that car laterveer told reporters here 
minutes after the incident police cordoned off the area near 
the american and british embassies 
on oct 24 a bomb destroyed the car of the spanish consul in 
rotterdam three days later two blasts damaged the trade mission 
and the labor bureau here one person was slightly injured in the 
latter incident 
last month the basque terrorist organization eta claimed 
responsibility for those attacks a statement in a spanish 
newspaper said they were in retaliation for the netherlands 1980 
refusal to grant entry to three eta members who were subsequently 
jailed in spain 
but today laterveer said that that claim had been assigned a 
low priority by dutch police noting that the eta seldom ventured 
outside spain 
we have no idea who the perpetrators are laterveer said

a volcano that inspired the legend of the 
lost civilization of atlantis triggered summer frost crop failure 
and famine a half a world away scientists said 
the link enabled nasa scientists to date one of the most 
powerful volcanic eruptions in recorded history 
ancient chinese annals tell how the climate was disrupted about 
3600 years ago after what scientists now know was the eruption of 
santorini volcano which destroyed much of the aegean island of 
thera near what became greece 
the eruption was dated to 1600 bc give or take 30 years by 
researchers headed by astronomer kevin pang of the national 
aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
pang presented the findings tuesday during an american geophysical 
union meeting 
not only are we able to get a date for this eruption if 
people agree on the same century thats pretty good but we now 
actually have eyewitness accounts of what happened to the weather 
thousands of miles away in china after the therasantorini 
eruption pang said 
nasa said effects of santorinis blast were felt around the 
world and theras destruction is believed to be the source of 
platos story of atlantis which tells of an island civilization 
submerged by the sea after being shaken by earthquakes 
recent archaeological studies suggest that atlantis may have 
been minoan centers on crete destroyed by tidal waves from the 
therasantorini eruption pang said 
us geological survey volcanologist bob tilling called pangs 
study kind of neat he has another line of evidence linking 
climatic effects to that eruption we need to get a better idea 
of how often these large eruptions take place and whether there is 
any pattern to them that gives us a much better basis to forecast 
possible future eruptions 
pang said santorinis eruption packed the punch of 2 million 
hiroshima atomic bombs going off at the same time santorini was 
roughly 100 times more powerful than krakatau indonesia 1883 
mount st helens is a little bitty volcano compared with this 
pang and nasa called the therasantorini explosion the most 
powerful volcano eruption in recorded history tilling said he was 
unsure of the latest estimates but it is clearly one of the 
largest 
the volcano spewed sunlightblocking debris and acid aerosols 
chilling earths climate to cause disturbances noted in historical 
accounts of the reign of king jie the last king of the xia 
dynasty which is chinas earliest recorded dynasty 
at the time of king jie the sun was dimmed the annals say 
three suns appeared due to ice crystals in the atmosphere 
refracting the suns image winter and summer came 
irregularly frosts formed in the sixth month july on the 
chinese calendar the five cereals withered therefore 
famine occurred there was heavy rainfall and communities were 
destroyed 
cold wet summers also were observed following massive eruptions 
of indonesias tambora in 1815 icelands laki in 1783 and another 
iceland volcano in 208 bc pang said 
after finding references to santorinis climatic effects in the 
xia dynasty histories pang and his colleagues dated those 
references using shang dynasty oracle bones genealogies 
inscribed on tortoise shells and ox shoulder blades and western 
zhou royal genealogies 
the genealogies previously were dated by linking astronomical 
events to the reigns of certain kings in one case pang found a 
historical account of a day that dawned twice that must have been 
april 21 899 bc when dawn was interrupted by a solar eclipse 
pang said previous studies used volcanocaused excesses of 
sulfuric acid in ice cores from greenland to estimate thera erupted 
happened between 1670 bc and 1620 bc compared with his date 
range of 1630 bc to 1570 bc stunted growth rings in irish oak 
trees and north american pines put it between 1613 bc and 1631 
bc 
some date it as late as the 14th century bc and some date it 
as early as the 18th century bc he said now all the methods 
are converging on the late 17th century bc 
pang conducted the study with physicist santosh srivastava and 
computer scientist robert keston of jet propulsion laboratory and 
hunghsiang chou an asian languages professor at the university of 
california los angeles

the state attorney general plans to turn 
documents over to the us justice department for its investigation 
of whether georgia racially discriminates in the way it elects 
judges 
attorney general michael bowers decision came tuesday a day 
after a threejudge federal panel in savannah released a decision 
ordering a federal review of 48 judgeships for racial 
discrimination 
bowers has until jan 1 to submit information to federal 
officials who then would have 60 days to file objections to any of 
the judgeships 
six of the states 137 superior court judges are black the 
states population is almost 30 percent black 
the panel consisting of two us district court judges and one 
federal appeals judge said superior court judges may complete 
their terms but may not seek reelection until the state obtains 
clearance of their posts 
the panel also said the state may not fill five new judgeships 
created this year until the justice department approves them 
all 53 of the judgeships are scheduled to be filled by state 
elections in 1990 
at an atlanta news conference bowers said he would comply with 
the federal order but he wasnt ruling out the possibility of a 
state appeal to the us supreme court 
the federal court ruling came in a lawsuit filed by the american 
civil liberties union state rep tyrone brooks a fulton county 
democrat and others who contend the states judicial election laws 
are discriminatory 
laughlin mcdonald an aclu attorney handling the case said he 
was surprised the state did not maintain its hardline defense 
im glad they are going to submit the information to the 
justice department mcdonald said they should have done it a 
long time ago 
the lawsuit contends 48 judgeships created since nov 1 1964 
violated the 1965 voting rights act because they were not 
precleared by the justice department as the law requires the 
justice department did clear 29 other judgeships finding no 
discrimination 
superior court judges are elected circuitwide by majority vote 
to designated seats the circuit sometimes covers several counties 
brooks wants judges to be elected in district elections but 
bowers said such a practice would be the antithesis of 
representative government because judges hear cases from all over a 
circuit not just an elected district

pope john paul ii says the ecological crisis 
is becoming a threat to world peace and can only be solved by 
overcoming greed consumerism and indifference to life 
in his annual message for the roman catholic churchs world day 
of peace the pope said tuesday that the destruction of the 
environment is actually a moral issue 
the pope said he wasnt asking that the modern world return to a 
paradise lost but for moderation discipline and the spirit of 
sacrifice 
threats to world peace he said come not only from the arms 
race regional conflicts and social injustice but also the 
plundering of natural resources and by a progressive decline in the 
quality of life 
the sense of precariousness and insecurity that such a 
situation engenders is a seabed for collective selfishness 
disregard for others and dishonesty john paul said in the 
message which is sent to world leaders 
the pope chooses a different topic each year for the new years 
message and used it to present some of his widest views to date on 
the environment last year he examined threats to peace from 
ethnic disputes 
john paul spared neither industrialized nor developing societies 
from criticism 
it is manifestly unjust that a privileged few should continue 
to accumulate excess goods squandering available resources while 
masses of people are living in conditions of misery at the very 
lowest level of subsistence the pope said 
but he said countries in the process of industrialization are 
not morally free to repeat the errors made in the past by others 
and recklessly continue to damage the environment through 
industrial pollutants radical deforestration or unlimited 
exploitation of nonrenewable resources 
john paul did not name any individual country at a news 
conference to present the message a vatican official monsignor 
jorge maria mejia noted that the church in italy the philippines 
brazil and indonesia has spoken out against destruction of forests 
the pope condemned genetic manipulation the unscrupulous 
development of new forms of plant and animal life and 
unacceptable experimentation on the origins of human life 
he lamented that laboratory tests continue on new offensive 
weapons capable of altering the balance of nature despite 
international agreements prohibiting chemical bacteriological and 
biological warfare 
the seriousness of the ecological crisis he said lays bare 
the depth of mans moral crisis if an appreciation of the value of 
the human person and of human life is lacking we will also lose 
interest in others and the earth itself

the wakeup call everybody had been 
waiting for finally came hundreds of foreigners grabbed their 
luggage walked out of their hotels and boarded buses today to 
escape the crossfire of a coup attempt 
we were just dying to get out we were afraid that if they 
the rebels became desperate they would get us said michelle 
nadela 21 of reno texas 
a truce between mutinous soldiers who held manilas makati 
financial district where many hotels catering to foreigners are 
located allowed hundreds to finally flee what had become the heart 
of the 5dayold revolt 
when the ceasefire went into effect they were told to pack 
their bags and board government buses 
it was slick it was a superb operation said crosby nash 
58 of centreville md 
throughout the morning buses ferried hundreds of guests from 
the hotels to a dutyfree shopping center 20 minutes away next to 
the international airport about 300 people immediately hopped 
aboard the first available flights out of the country 
among the people shuttled from the financial district by the 
department of tourism including residents of makati apartments 
were at least 241 americans natives of more than 40 other 
countries including japan britain israel and even peru were 
among the 1800 people rescued 
officials said at least four foreigners remained in the area 
the evacuees were happy to have left behind some harrowing 
experiences 
briton danny chevin said he heard gunfire and saw tracers 
tuesday night coming from the roof of the intercontinental hotel 
just above the room where he was staying 
i thought that if they government troops started firing 
back it would come right at our windows said chevin of london 
chevin said he recorded the firefight on videotape and other 
guests also went away with makati mementos 
marion auspitz of new york for example picked up a bullet 
found next door to her room in the manila peninsula 
and fanny dickins a british resident of hong kong took a 
picture with a rebel leader before boarding the evacuation bus from 
the intercontinental 
i found them all sympathetic they were very nice and 
extremely polite all of them she said of the rebels 
indeed many of the foreigners had nothing but praise for the 
mutineers who occupied the hotels 
they were being very professional about everything they 
didnt want to hurt us said chevin 
they did not treat us at any time as hostages added ron 
kay 39 of atlanta 
thomas adkins of san diego said rebels even served a breakfast 
of bacon and eggs to some of the nikko manila garden hotel guests 
saturday morning 
the manila garden was the first hotel evacuated with the 
management using the public address system at dawn to inform guests 
of the impending move 
the intercontinental came next followed by the peninsula where 
guests had slept in the lobby guests at the hotels said 
electricity telephone and water service all had deteriorated by 
early wednesday 
at the dutyfree center the united states and several other 
countries set up reception desks and the government provided 
assistance for transportation and hotel bookings 
it feels good said kay as he nursed a cold san miguel beer 
next to a reception desk set up by the us embassy im happy to

president lee tenghui today promised more 
democratic reforms after the ruling nationalist partys setback in 
taiwans first multiparty elections acknowledging a decline in his 
partys credibility 
the nationalists suffered their worst losses in 40 years in 
power in saturdays balloting the party lost several key local 
county executive posts and garnered 58 percent of the total vote 
down from 70 percent in 1986 
it was a setback for our party as far as our original goal was 
concerned said lee who also chairs the nationalist party 
the decision made by the voters was not a coincidence lee 
told the partys decisionmaking central standing committee it 
indicates the various reform measures undertaken by the government 
in recent years had failed to meet the publics expectations 
opposition supporters meanwhile ended four days of massive 
demonstrations against alleged vote fraud after a recounting of 
ballots began at the heavily guarded tainan district court in 
southern taiwan 
during the election and raucous campaign the opposition party 
accused the nationalists of widespread vote buying and ballot box 
stuffing 
lee said the government had failed to solve such problems as 
worsening crime social morale and the authorities declining 
credibility 
we must learn our lesson from the setback we must not 
hesitate any more lee said we are more sure of our way and 
will take faster and more positive steps toward various political 
and other reforms 
lee has pushed for the retirement of hundreds of elderly members 
who dominate the legislature they were elected on the chinese 
mainland before the nationalists fled taiwan in 1949 and were 
frozen in office to support the nationalists claim to be the sole 
legitimate ruler of all of china 
few have accepted handsome government pensions and filed for 
retirement 
earlier in tainan about 2000 noisy protesters occupied a 
section of a freeway and stopped traffic for an hour as recounts 
were stalled by the slow transportation of ballot boxes from eight 
villages police and witnesses said 
huang chincheng chief prosecutor of the tainan district court 
said the count would take three days because the process was going 
to be monitored by campaign officers of both the opposition and 
nationalist candidates for the county executive post 
the nationalist candidate was initially declared the winner 
on tuesday about 10000 opposition supporters screaming for a 
recount clashed with police who cordoned off a square next to 
county government offices several were injured 
opposition democratic progressive party chairman huang 
hsinchieh went to tainan and asked for a recount the government 
initially refused fearing all other losing candidates would follow 
suit

a beleaguered president corazon 
aquino declared a state of national emergency today and pleaded 
with fellow filipinos to defy the hundreds of mutinous soldiers who 
want to kill me 
the declaration came after a ceasefire between rebel and 
loyalist troops enabled about 1800 foreigners hundreds of them 
americans to be evacuated from manilas financial district scene 
of heavy fighting since saturday 
the rebels angered at us military support for mrs aquino 
had on tuesday threatened to prevent some americans from leaving 
today they issued a veiled threat against those who remain in the 
country 
after the evacuation rebel and military representatives then 
opened talks for a peaceful settlement of the crisis 
mrs aquino had previously vowed not to negotiate demanding 
that the rebels surrender or die she had also overruled 
recommendations from cabinet members two days ago to declare a 
state of emergency 
you my beloved countrymen i depend on you the obviously 
strained and fatigued mrs aquino said on natonal television before 
declaring the emergency she appealed for a show of people 
power in the streets on friday similar to the 1986 demonstrations 
that helped put her in office 
the plea came five days after thousands of mutineers launched 
the strongest attempt yet to topple mrs aquinos administration 
which has been widely criticized as indecisive and inept 
it was unclear what specific powers mrs aquino would be able to 
wield under the emergency declaration press secretary adolfo 
azcuna said the government planned to take over utilities and 
transport but not the media 
sen john osmena said most of the 23 senators endorsed the move 
and he expected congress to grant mrs aquino sweeping powers 
but opposition rep salvador britannico said it would discourage 
foreign investment and tourism the opposition believes that it 
is a first steptoward the declaration of martial law 
cabinet officials said the declaration was not tantamount to 
martial law and that there would be no curtailment of civil 
liberties 
this is not martial law said labor secretary franklin 
drilon theres no curfew theres no suspension of the writ of 
habeas corpus congress will continue we will continue to enjoy 
our rights it only empowers government to check those who may not 
be delivering basic services 
the announcement came as estimated 400 rebel soldiers continued 
to hold the makati financial district and a similar number of 
mutineers held an air base on cebu island about 350 miles south of 
manila 
opposition sources claim the rebels also have the support of 
other units that have not moved overtly against the government 
the insurrection the sixth in mrs aquinos nearly 4yearold 
government has claimed the lives of at least 77 people and left 
more than 540 wounded 
on national television tonight the president attempted to 
rekindle the nowdormant people power that toppled ferdinand 
marcos and propelled her into office with a plea for people to take 
to the streets on friday 
she said the rebels wanted to dismantle democracy and return the 
nation to the dark days of martial law which marcos imposed from 
1972 until 1981 
i am telling you now that i put so much at stake for 
democracy the president said speaking extemporaneously 
i have lost my husband it is very clear that these people 
want to kill me want to eliminate me so that they can rule our 
land she said 
mrs aquinos husband sen benigno aquino jr was slain in 
1983 moments after returning from the united states to challenge 
marcos for leadership 
the rebels have demanded that she resign in favor of a coalition 
to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government the 
have accused her of ignoring corruption refusing to intiate social 
and economic reforms and failing to crush the communist insurgency 
early today buses began transporting foreigners trapped in 
hotels and condominiums in makati which the insurgents seized on 
saturday 
us embassy and philippine authorities said at least 241 
americans were among the foreigners taken out safely 
during the evacuation military chief of staff gen renato de 
villa designated brig gen arturo enrile superintendent of the 
philippine military academy to negotiate with the rebels in the 
financial district 
sporadic sniping resumed however when the evacuation was 
completed 
more than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and a 
shopping area near the airport where evacuees were taken until 
arrangements could be made for them to leave the country 
it was slick said crosby nash 58 of centreville md of 
the evacuation he had been stranded at the manila garden hotel 
it was a superb operation i think theres certainly relief 
a rebel officer had said trapped americans might not go free 
because in a gesture of support for mrs aquino whose term 
expires in june 1992 us warplanes providing air cover for 
loyalist forces early in the revolt 
but a statement issued today said the insurgents executive 
committee decided late tuesday to free all the americans because 
these american tourists are not our enemy 
later today however a statement issued in the name of a rebel 
leader brig gen edgardo abenina declared the insurgents were in 
a state of war 
we advise the us government to prepare a plan for the 
evacuation of its nationals as the impotent aquino administration 
may not be able to ensure their safety said the statement 
distributed to news organizations 
we appeal to the american people to exert pressure on the 
united states government to refrain from pursuing any policy or 
action which may trigger a new philippineamerican war

the attorney for a florida woman who lost a rape 
case because the jury said she asked for it says the woman is 
vindicated now that her accused attacker has been sentenced to life 
in prison in georgia 
but attorney alexander siegel said steven lamar lord who 
pleaded guilty tuesday to raping and kidnapping a decatur woman 
was trying a foolish ploy when he told the judge his plea would 
prevent the victim from reliving her trauma in court 
thats like attila the hun saying he was sorry for trampling a 
few thousand extra people siegel said in a telephone interview 
from his fort lauderdale home 
superior court judge hilton fuller of dekalb county sentenced 
lord 26 to life in prison for the rape and a concurrent 20year 
sentence for kidnapping the woman at a 24hour banking machine in 
decatur in georgia those sentenced to life are eligible to be 
considered for parole after seven years 
court records show that lord had reportedly told the victim 
its your fault youre wearing a skirt 
lords attorney public defender bill hankins told fuller that 
lord regrets very much what has happened to her 
lord was acquitted of rape in october in fort lauderdale fla 
at that time the jury foreman roy diamond said jurors believed 
the woman accusing him who was wearing a white lace miniskirt 
without underwear when she was attacked had asked for it 
although diamond later said he meant she asked for sex and not 
rape the acquittal sparked a national controversy 
other jurors then said they were swayed by the womans calm 
demeanor in court compared with the emotional testimony of the 
24yearold decatur woman who testified in the florida trial that 
lord raped her at knifepoint 
when the georgia woman testified my heart sank said juror 
dean medeiros but when the other one testified she didnt 
appear to be shaken up basically we didnt believe her story 
betty grant president of the georgia chapter of the national 
organization for women said tuesday night she was delighted 
that lord was finally sentenced 
theres no remorseful awareness here i hope his sentence 
sticks because we know rape offenders do repeat the crime she 
said 
siegel contended that lords guilty plea came because he heard 
the decatur womans testimony before his hearing in georgia 
he knew he didnt stand a chance the attorney said 
siegel said he had not been able to reach his client with the 
news of lords plea because her phone was out of order he said 
though that she would be very relieved

the evangelist who introduced jim bakker 
to jessica hahn was charged along with a former ptl minister with 
lying to a special grand jury 
the federal grand jury on tuesday charged evangelist john wesley 
fletcher with one count of perjury for his testimony about how 
bakker was introduced to ms hahn 
according to the indictment on sept 24 1987 he denied taking 
miss hahn to a clearwater beach fla hotel to have sex with 
bakker but the indictment said on sept 20 1988 he testified 
that he agreed when bakker asked him get me a woman 
sam johnson a former minister at ptls heritage village church 
was charged with 12 counts of perjury for his testimony before the 
special grand jury johnsons testimony focused on a 10000 loan 
he made to former ptl executive vice president richard dortch that 
later went to ms hahn 
the payment was made nov 1 1984 before the former church 
secretary received 265000 in ptl funds in exchange for her 
silence about her 1980 sexual encounter with bakker in a florida 
motel room 
we dont expect any further ptlrelated indictments from this 
grand jury said assistant us attorney jerry miller who 
prosecuted bakker he wouldnt elaborate 
the indictments were issued about three hours after dortch 
bakkers former second in command at ptl testified to the federal 
grand jury 
dortch who pleaded guilty in august to fraud and conspiracy for 
his role in the ptl affair had no comment as he left the 
courthouse 
late tuesday dortchs attorneys filed a motion asking us 
district judge robert potter to reduce dortchs sentence because of 
his cooperation with prosecutors 
dortch was sentenced to eight years in prison and fined 
200000 his plea agreement enables the former assemblies of god 
official to remain free until federal authorities no longer require 
his cooperation 
according to prosecutors dortch had one of his assistants 
deliver 10000 in an envelope to former ptl board member aimee 
cortese who handed over the money to miss hahn during a meeting at 
a church in new york city in november 1984 
during his two appearances before the special ptl grand jury 
johnson said dortch had asked him for a 10000 loan but johnson 
told the panel he could not remember where he got the money 
according to the indictment 
johnson could not be reached for comment tuesday his secretary 
pam jewett said he was taping a christmas tv special in the 
mountains 
fletchers number wasnt listed in the durham telephone 
directory so attempts to reach him were unsuccessful 
bakker is serving a 45year term in a federal prison in 
minnesota after being convicted oct 5 of fraud and conspiracy 
bakker is appealing the conviction but a panel of the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals refused to free bakker on bond while the 
appeal was prepared 
bakker was accused of bilking followers who sent him 158 
million for partnerships in the ministry entitling them to annual 
lodging guarantees prosecutors said bakker diverted 37 million 
in ptl money to buy expensive homes cars jewelry and vacations

and fox urine public works director ralph dannenberg said tuesday 
the commercial product has an odor very much like a skunks and 
can last on cloth and carpeting for weeks if not months 
dannenberg said the mixture is extremely potent in an enclosed 
area he said 
you cant even smell it going on the trees but once you bring 
it inside a heated room it does start to stink he said we 
sprayed it on a bush and brought it in the office to test it out 
and got the thing back outside in a hurry 
since the spraying began the city has had no reports of tree 
thefts from parks during the christmas season he said 
a company in fort collins colo rocky mountain wildlife 
services said this week that it has begun marketing such a spray 
to cemeteries cities ski areas landscape companies and private

several stores were destroyed and police appealed for anyone in 
the area with picks and shovels to help search through rubble for 
survivors cries for help could be heard beneath some of the ruins

window 
the owner of a hardware store cried out in agony when he saw the 
bodies of his wife and daughter brought out of the rubble only his 
little girls patent leather shoes were visible beneath the bloody 
sheet covering her 
no one claimed responsibility for the attack but suspicion fell 
on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nations citys 
in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected 
traffickers to the united states 
the explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government 
said a bomb placed aboard a colombian airliner had caused it to 
crash shortly after takeoff from bogota last month killing all 107

have been responsibile for that bomb

blast occurred at 730 am after the headquarters had opened for 
the day 
an hour later firefighters still were trying to control fires 
amid the remains of stores and columns of smoke rose over the 
downtown area 
the colombian radio networks rcn and caracol were reporting from 
the scene of the bombing and quoted police officials there on the 
number of fatalities 
in a live broadcast interview with caracol health minister 
eduardo diaz said about 1000 people had been treated hospitals for 
bomb blast injuries 
the police department known as the das is where many 
foreigners usually line up at this time of year to get 
authorization to leave the country for christmas vacations 
however it was not known immediately if any foreigners were among 
the victims of the explosion the foreigners must get clearance 
from th das which determines whether they face any criminal 
charges in colombia 
the building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit 
and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to 
work 
the goverment of president virgilio barco declared war on the 
nations cocaine cartels after sen luis carlos galan a leading 
presidential candidate and antidrug crusader was assassinated on 
aug 18 as part of the crackdown the government has been

us military support for forces loyal to 
philippines president corazon aquino could bring on a civil war 
said the son of that countrys former leader 
if the american government brings in firepower to support the 
aquino government america will be at war with us ferdinand 
marcos jr told columnist cindy adams in an interview published 
today in the new york post 
the united states provided air cover last friday for the 
philippine military against mutinous soldiers 
the logical extreme if pushed to the limits is america lands 
forces and involves itself in our battle let there be no mistake 
america will find itself at war with the philippines he said in 
new york 
this is our fight marcos said the man in the street has 
intense resentment towards us airplanes overflying him it could 
push what is now still considered an uprising into fullscale civil 
war 
if america comes in to mediate ok but if america tries to 
intervene between one group and another and remember the rebels 
are loyal to the united states our country will kill the 
americans and each other and violence will escalate he said 
mutinereers last week launched the strongest attempt yet to 
topple mrs aquinos administration which has been widely 
criticized as indecisive and inept mrs aquino took over after 
ferdinand marcos was ousted in 1986 
although the bush administration has defended aquino as the 
philippines democratically elected leader the son of the late 
marcos insisted on abcs good morning america today that the 
antiaquino faction could be described as proamerican its been 
quite ironic that the united states has used its military might 
against them he said 
it was a dangerous precedent to begin with which i think was 
a serious mistake in judgment on americas part marcos said 
it will be evident in years to come the wave of 
antiamericanism that has derived from that move may be felt for 
years to come he said

construction is expected to begin next 
year on an ecumenical center to house nuns now living in a 
controversial convent outside the auschwitz concentration camp 
american jewish leaders said today 
robert k lifton president of the american jewish congress and 
henry siegman its executive director said their discussions this 
week with roman catholic primate cardinal jozef glemp and the 
krakow archbishop cardinal franciszek macharski showed a firm 
commitment to complete the center 
the decision to proceed was irreversible siegman said at a 
news conference held at the offices of prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki after the delegation met with mazowiecki 
the group said it has designated a polish citizen to act as its 
permanent representative to maintain relations between poland and 
the jewish community in the united states they said he would be 
the first permanent link between american jews and poles in 
poland since the outbreak of world war ii 
the delegation agreed with the roman catholic church leaders to 
help formulate programs that will educate catholics about jews on 
the local parish level 
lifton said the delegation from the new yorkbased american 
jewish congress delegation came to poland to acquaint itself with 
the dramatic political changes in the country under its new 
solidarityled government and to talk about relations between jews 
and polish catholics 
besides meeting mazowiecki glemp and macharski they had talks 
with solidarity leader lech walesa and finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz 
polishjewish relations were strained this year when the roman 
catholic church indicated it would renege on a 1987 promise to move 
the convent housing 14 carmelite nuns from just outside the 
auschwitz fence to the proposed ecumenical center for prayer and 
education 
a small group of american jews led by rabbi avi weiss entered 
the convent grounds as a protest and were removed by construction 
workers a subsequent sermon by glemp was viewed by many jews as 
containing antisemitic language 
but in recent months a vatican statement upholding the agreement 
to move the nuns and conciliatory talks between glemp and jewish 
leaders in london appear to have repaired most of the damage from 
the incidents lifton stressed the need to improve future relations 
instead of dwelling on past injuries 
lifton and siegman were critical of weiss and siegman said his 
actions had caused terrible damages to all of the objectives 
close to the american jewish community and the state of israel not 
to mention the local jewish community 
they said it was important for poles to understand that weiss 
was acting only on his own account and was not representing any 
important segment of the american jewish community 
in a democratic society people at the margin can never be 
controlled in what they say or do all you can do is make sure they 
remain at the margins said siegman 
the jewish leaders gave the new solidarity government high marks 
for its commitment to fight antisemitism in poland where only a 
few thousand jews remain from a prewar community of about 35 
million and its efforts to democratize polish society and address 
its economic problems 
polands new leaders are clear about their desire to relegate 
antisemitism to the margins of polish society said siegman 
we have to recognize the mistakes of the past and the harm 
and pain they have caused learn from them and then move 
forward said lifton

it was more painful than she expected but the 
woman who gave up part of her liver for her baby girl in the 
nations first living donor liver transplant says she would do it 
again 
i feel real good teresa smith said tuesday during her first 
public appearance since she and her daughter alyssa underwent 
surgery nov 27 
i dont feel like a first she said i feel like any 
parent who is looking out for the best interests of her child 
there was a little more pain than i expected added mrs 
smith 29 but this was our best option for alyssa 
alyssa suffered from biliary atresia an oftenfatal congenital 
liver disorder 
alyssa remained in serious but stable condition at university of 
chicago hospitals she still has a lot of hurdles to cross but 
the piece of liver transplanted from her mother has shown no signs 
of rejection said dr peter whitington director of pediatric 
services at the hospital 
mrs smith told reporters shed seen her 21monthold daughter 
several times since the weekend when she had recovered enough to 
visit alyssa for the first time since the operation 
much of their time together has been spent sharing books and 
getting alyssa to play with her toys said the fourthgrade teacher 
from schertz texas near san antonio 
mrs smith will be discharged before the weekend said 
whitington 
there is a 50 percent chance alyssa will be released in time for 
christmas although she will have to remain near the hospital for a 
time he said 
the liver is still not functioning perfectly whitington 
said right now shes a little yellow but all other functions 
have pretty much fallen into place 
another pioneering transplant patient a woman who was given a 
heart liver and kidney has been upgraded to serious condition and 
taken off a ventilator three days after her historic surgery 
doctors said cindy martin 26 of archbald pa was responding 
well following the 21hour operation that began saturday at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital in pittsburgh 
the next living donor transplant candidate probably will arrive 
in chicago in january whitington said and as many as eight of the 
operations could be performed through february 
the second child scheduled for the procedure probably will not 
have the operation sixteenmonthold sarina jones of millington 
tenn near memphis who arrived at the hospital friday is too ill 
to be a good candidate for the operation whitington said 
she is every bit as malnourished as an ethiopian refugee he 
said shes a worse physical candidate than she was when 
doctors first examined her last friday 
if she recovers doctors probably will use a cadaver liver if 
one becomes available whitington said

a judge ordered five dallas and tulsa 
lawyers to jail because they refused to testify about the source of 
fees they received in a 1987 drug case but a federal appeals court 
temporarily halted the order 
a hearing before the 10th us circuit court of appeals is 
scheduled for dec 13 
the lawyers refused to testify tuesday before a federal grand 
jury about fees they received for defending methamphetamine makers 
convicted on drug charges in federal court in muskogee 
us district judge james o ellison ordered the lawyers jailed 
for contempt hours later after an emergency session the us 
circuit court in denver stayed the contempt citations and ordered 
the men freed on their own recognizance until an appeal could be 
heard 
the men claim fee information is a privileged communication 
between attorney and client ellison disagreed 
the attorneyclient privilege shields only those 
communications made for the purpose of securing legal advice 
ellison wrote in the court order matters involving the payment 
of fees and the identity of clients are not generally privileged 
the federal government is investigating dallas nightclub owner 
james coltharps alleged connection to the methamphetamine lab in 
beggs about 30 miles south of tulsa federal prosecutors allege 
coltharp may have paid the attorneys fees for the convicted lab 
crew 
the lawyers are stanley monroe and john echols of tulsa and 
scott anderson james walker and tex mcconathy of dallas none is 
accused of any impropriety and none is the target of the grand jury 
inquiry us attorney tony m graham said 
in his court order ellison said the fact that the men are not 
the target of the investigation means they cannot claim protection 
under the fifth amendment 
nothing in the circumstances before this court demonstrates 
that compliance with the subpoenas as to the payment of fees 
would in any way convey the substance of any confidential 
communication ellison wrote

the fate of a hispanic policeman accused of 
manslaughter in the shooting of a black motorcyclist was in the 
hands of the jury today almost 11 months after the killing sparked 
three days of race riots 
the multiethnic jury two blacks one hispanic and three 
nonhispanic whites began deliberations today after almost seven 
weeks of jury selection and testimony closely followed by the 
citys residents 
deliberations began at 950 am after the jury received 
lastminute instructions from dade county circuit judge joseph 
farina 
colombianborn officer william lozano 31 faces two counts of 
manslaughter in the deaths of the motorcyclist clement lloyd 23 
and his passenger allan blanchard 24 
police and community relations officials have geared up for 
possible renewed rioting if lozano is acquitted however they said 
the presence of two blacks on the jury along with extensive live 
broadcasts of testimony and arguments may have defused tensions 
in neighborhoods that have exploded four times this decade after 
police violence against blacks 
during final arguments prosecutors said lozano had no excuse 
for shooting lloyd as the bike sped up an overtown street while 
fleeing a squad car 
its real hard to believe a police officer could do something 
so stupid chief assistant state attorney john hogan said that 
this man on january 16th intentionally pulled the trigger and 
wiped out two human beings 
defense attorney roy black countered by accusing the state of 
trying to make lozano a scapegoat to ease racial tensions 
hes sort of like a pawn caught up in forces beyond his 
control black said 
black said defense testimony showed lozano was about to be run 
down by the motorcycle when he fired 
this man discharged his gun for one reason only because he 
thought he was going to be run over because he thought he was 
going to be killed 
if convicted lozano could be sentenced to a maximum 30 years on 
each manslaughter count 
jurors heard from almost 60 witnesses after testimony began nov 
15 the trial opened oct 23 but it took more than three weeks to 
seat a jury 
the shooting occurred on martin luther kings birthday as miami 
began a week of celebration leading up to the super bowl 
within an hour after the shooting a mob gathered at the scene 
in the predominantly black overtown neighborhood and began pelting 
officers with rocks and bottles 
by the time the violence ended three days later one looter had 
been shot to death 11 people were wounded by gunfire and 13 
buildings were burned down in the overtown and liberty city 
neighborhoods 
it was the fourth such riot in miami in the 1980s the first 
occurred in 1980 after an allwhite jury in tampa acquitted a group 
of metrodade policemen accused of beating black insurance 
executive arthur mcduffie to death 
in 1982 a riot broke out when miami officer luis alvarez 
entered an overtown video arcade and shot and killed nevell 
johnson who was black two years later violence broke out again 
when alvarez was acquitted by an allwhite jury

five businessmen say they are establishing 
a 6 million college scholarship fund for graduates of the 
200student winona cotter high school a private roman catholic 
school 
we wanted to motivate students to try to use more of the 
potential we think they all have said one of the businessmen 
robert kierlin a cotter graduate and president of winonas 
fastenal corp 
one of my pet theories as ive gotten older is that no one 
performs to 100 percent of their ability kierlin said it 
would be really great if some of the cotter students got a better 
chance to go to a little bit better college than they might 
otherwise aspire to 
the businessmen also are giving 2 million for construction of 
an indoor athletic facility for the school in southeastern 
minnesota the gifts come one year after they gave more than 5 
million for teachers salaries and other expenses 
the latest gift means that all current and future cotter 
students could receive money for part or all of their college 
expenses 
the scholarship fund was in part a reaction to a teachers 
observation that many of her students worked after school said 
kierlin who with four fastenal founders arranged for the gift from 
the proceeds of a recent stock sale 
we believe in the work ethic too but not necessarily during 
the school year kierlin said 
fastenal sells threaded fasteners and other industrial and 
construction supplies in the midwest 
this years 39 seniors will share about 50000 but subsequent 
larger classes will share about 125000 
educators and philanthropy watchers said the gifts would be 
remarkable for us colleges and is unheard of for a high school 
eight million dollars is extraordinary astounding said 
charles pinto high school consultant for the archdiocese of 
chicago which runs the largest private school system in the 
country and the nations seventh largest school system of any kind 
but whats important is that the money is not being given just 
to the school but to students pinto said

city council has approved legislation to protect 
the health and safety of more than 12000 city workers who use 
video display terminals 
the bill is the toughest vdt law in the nation and the first law 
of its kind in a major city according to the new york city video 
display terminal coalition of labor unions and occupational safety 
and health groups 
the bill approved tuesday mandates that vdt operators at city 
agencies be given a 15minute break whenever they are required to 
work at a terminal for more than two consecutive hours 
under the law vdt workers with certain medical conditions 
including pregnancy would be allowed to obtain transfers some 
studies have suggested prolonged vdt exposure increases risk of 
miscarriage 
the bill also mandates that lighting and furniture be adjusted 
to prevent eye strain and repetitive strain injury to hands and 
other parts of the body affected by prolonged vdt use 
we hope new york citys legislation will set a national 
precedent for protecting these workers not only from repetitive 
strain injuries but from eye strain headaches blurred vision 
and for pregnant women from hazards that may lead to 
miscarriage said diane stein coordinator of the vdt coalition

a unmanned module docked with the mir space 
station today bringing the cosmonauts a space motorcycle that 
will allow them to work outside the station in greater safety and 
comfort 
problems with a guidance system had prevented the 40ton kvant 2 
module from docking as scheduled on saturday but the tass dispatch 
announcing todays docking did not say how that difficulty had been 
overcome 
one of two panels of a solar battery on board the kvant 2 would 
not open shortly after takeoff but tass said scientists solved 
that problem later 
the space motorcycle looks like a floating armchair and was 
designed for use in repairing satellites and rescuing cosmonauts in 
distress 
the module also carries a shower and sink and an incubator in 
which quail eggs are to be hatched to study the effects of 
weightlessness on heredity 
cosmonauts alexander s viktorenko 42 and alexander a 
serebrov 45 the latest mir crew have been aboard the space

a roman catholic lay missionary accused of 
involvement with salvadoran guerrillas is back in the united states 
after spending the weekend in custody 
scott wright 38 of san antonio was released monday by 
authorities in san salvador on the condition that he leave the 
country he arrived in san antonio on tuesday 
wright said he was taken into custody with a spanish priest and 
three salvadoran lay workers last friday when uniformed police came 
to the parish hall where they were working 
they searched for two hours they found nothing but some 
papers and a few religious relics he said no one ever told us 
why it was being searched or why we were being detained 
he and the priest were separated from the salvadorans 
even handcuffed blindfolded and made to stand like that for 
hours i believe we received preferential treatment he said with 
a wry smile 
wright who spent most of the last three years in el salvador 
said the salvadoran government is increasing reprisals against 
church workers because they witnessed the effects of recent bombing 
in the capital city on civilians and because officials insist they 
are aiding the enemy 
the government basically has accused these parishes of 
collaborating with the guerrillas i think thats a false 
accusation wright said the church has opened its doors to 
refugees it has treated the wounded its continued to feed the 
people the children that is its mission

the glamour is fading from the computer industry 
at the close of the 1980s tarnishing one of the most remarkable 
success stories of american business 
the computer industry has behaved more like the auto or steel 
businesses this year with numerous layoffs and other job 
reductions while sales continue to rise the singledigit growth 
is a comedown for an industry that was accustomed to bounding gains 
early in the decade 
the latest evidence came tuesday when international business 
machines corp the worlds biggest computer company announced it 
would cut 10000 us jobs without layoffs because of slow growth 
in its home market 
ibm and independent analysts cite several reasons including an 
economic slowdown and sluggish capital spending by american 
companies 
but one of the biggest factors is that computer makers have 
worked their way out of sales they have made machines so cheap and 
powerful that customers no longer need to shell out millions of 
dollars to get a job done they can get by with spending a tenth or 
a hundredth as much 
there are some winners in this transformation the makers of 
personal computers and engineering workstations such as compaq 
computer corp apple computer inc and sun microsystems inc 
the losers are companies that get most of their profit from 
bigger costlier computers including ibm digital equipment corp 
unisys corp control data corp amdahl corp bull hn information 
systems inc wang laboratories inc and prime computer inc 
all those companies have cut jobs this year through layoffs or 
voluntary resignations and retirements their machines cant match 
personal computers for the combination of low price and high speed 
personal computers wont take over entirely big mainframe 
computers remain irreplaceable for jobs such as controlling access 
to vast reservoirs of data and handling complex computing jobs that 
cant be split up among several smaller machines minicomputers 
which lie between mainframes and personal computers also have a 
valuable role in many corporations 
but more and more personal computers are doing jobs that once 
were the exclusive reserve of bigger machines 
the little guys are just creeping up everywhere and theyre 
stealing their way into niches all over the place said doug 
crook a dataquest inc analyst 
all this is good for customers but bad for traditional computer 
makers ibm is a major factor in the personal computer market but 
makes very thin profit margins in that business in contrast to its 
fat profits from its dominant market position in mainframe 
computers 
digital equipment is in a similar bind this year it introduced 
a speedy computer workstation to compete with companies like sun 
microsystems the machine is so fast it threatens to cannibalize 
digitals own sales of its breadandbutter vax largecomputer line 
the danger to mainframes and minicomputers was obscured early in 
the decade by the industrys overall growth with expansion 
slowing the threat from personal computers is clearly delineated 
ibm said tuesday its business was stronger in europe and asia 
than in the united states one reason may be that personal 
computers are not as popular abroad once pcs catch on abroad they 
may sap strength from those markets for bigger computers as they 
did in this country said don bellomy an international data corp 
analyst 
bellomys company is projecting an 8 percent increase in us 
sales of computers next year about even with 7 percent this year 
but far less than the 30 percent a year in 1982 through 1984 
international data projects the strongest growth in pcs and 
workstations 11 percent and the weakest in mainframes up less 
than 1 percent 
cahners publishing co which publishes several trade magazines 
is more pessimistic it projects overall computer industry growth 
of 27 percent this year and less than 2 percent in 1990 
the scope of the difficulties is reflected in job figures 
according to the bureau of labor statistics computer industry 
employment in september was just under 420000 while that is about 
the same as the last few years it is down sharply from 471000 in 
september 1984 the industrys last boom year 
in its announcement tuesday ibm said that in addition to 
cutting 10000 jobs through retirement and separation incentives 
it would buy back 4 billion of its own stock 
it also said it would set aside 23 billion from its pretax 
profit to pay for the job cuts and related steps

the supreme court was urged today to permit 
the withdrawal of lifesustaining treatment from a missouri woman 
described as an unconscious shell but a state lawyer said the 
womans parents have no constitutional right to order such action 
william colby a lawyer representing the parents of nancy 
cruzan said if the permanently unconscious woman was lucid for a 
moment and could come before this court she would ask that a 
tube in her stomach providing food and water be removed 
her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in 
this case colby said she would choose liberty 
but assistant attorney general robert l presson of missouri 
said the parents have no constitutional right to precipitate their 
daughters death 
in this extraordinary situation the decision should be made 
by a judicial body presson said referring to a state court 
ruling that the feeding tubes must be retained 
solicitor general kenneth starr the bush administrations top 
courtroom lawyer supported presson 
starr urged the court to give states wide latitude that 
reflects reasonably the wishes of their citizens in this highly 
sensitive and deeply vexing situation 
there is no constitutional right to choose to die in such cases 
that overrides a states determination to require continued food 
and water for unconscious patients starr said 
the justices preparing for their first righttodie 
decision asked extensive questions of the lawyers 
justice sandra day oconnor asked whether a lower court that 
required the lifesupport treatment for ms cruzan decided the case 
based on the best interests of the patient 
i have been concerned because its not clear what standard 
the lower court set she said 
justice anthony m kennedy told colby you presume there is a 
liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence of the 
patients wishes 
in his presentation to the justices colby said of ms cruzan 
she is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers for the 
rest of her life 
ms cruzan 32 has been in what doctors call a persistent 
vegetative state for almost seven years her parents joe and joyce 
cruzan are asing the court to let them order removal of a 
surgically implanted tube providing her with food and water 
the missouri supreme court ruled doctors may not remove the tube 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a jan 11 1983 car 
crash she lies in a hospital bed her body rigid her hands and 
feet constricted and bent into claw shapes doctors say she cannot 
experience thoughts or emotions and that her condition is 
irreversible 
but ms cruzan can breathe on her own and has periods when her 
eyes are open and move randomly 
the surgically implanted tube could keep her alive for 30 years 
or more doctors say without it she would soon die of starvation 
or dehydration 
joe cruzan a sheetmetal worker allowed doctors to implant the 
tube four weeks after his daughters accident he said he was told 
he could have it removed after a year if there were no improvement 
in her condition 
the righttodie issue captured national headlines in 1976 when 
the new jersey supreme court allowed the family of karen ann 
quinlan to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe ms 
quinlan in a similar comalike state continued to be fed through 
a tube and lived for nine more years 
american courts since generally have permitted removal of 
lifesustaining treatment for such patients relying on a 1986 
american medical association opinion that artificially supplied 
nutrition and hydration are medical treatments 
the ama estimates 70 percent of americans at some time will be 
involved in a decision about whether to provide lifesustaining 
medical care for themselves or family members 
fortyone states including missouri have socalled living will 
laws that allow people to preauthorize the termination of 
lifesustaining treatment but missouris livingwill law which 
does not allow for removal of feeding tubes was not in effect when 
ms cruzan was injured 
her parents said she had told them she would not want to be kept 
alive by artificial means if ever rendered incompetent 
the missouri supreme court said such statements fall well short 
of the clear and convincing evidence needed to prove her real 
intent 
we choose to err on the side of life respecting the rights of 
incompetent persons who may wish to live despite a severely 
diminished quality of life the state court said 
even if the justices decide there is no constitutional right to 
die or that it cannot be exercised by a parent or guardian of an 
incompetent person states will remain free to let doctors remove 
lifesustaining treatment from certain patients 
but such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more 
difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment 
the bush administration argues in a friendofthecourt 
brief that even a competent adult does not have an unlimited right 
to refuse food and water justice department lawyers said states 
have always prohibited attempted suicide and noted some make it a 
crime to help a suicide 
the government said that even if a right to die exists it does 
not extend to an incompetent person and does not outweigh the 
states profound interest in preserving human life 
antiabortion groups also expressed support for the missouri 
court decision it limits the privacy right that undergirds the 
supreme courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion 
religious groups are split over the issue 
the us catholic conference and others say a victory for the 
cruzans could jeopardize the rights of the elderly or people with 
severe handicaps 
the evangelical lutheran church of america and others argue that 
families should be free of unwarranted state intrusion when making 
such decisions 
the case is cruzan vs missouri department of health 881503

the communist leadership will soon 
present a new government that meets opposition demands for more 
noncommunist members the nations top opposition leader said 
today 
vaclav havel said at a news conference that communist premier 
ladislav adamec will present a list of names for the cabinet to 
leaders of the prodemocracy movement for approval before the list 
is made public 
he refused to disclose any details of the intense negotiations 
to include more noncommunists as demanded by the nations 
prodemocracy movement 
adamec told the staterun news agency ctk that he had accepted 
from civic forum the leading opposition group a list of possible 
cabinet candidates 
he said he will consult with other official political parties on 
thursday then meet again with civic forum probably on friday and 
give them his proposals 
it was not known whether either side had set special conditions 
for the opposition to approve the cabinet 
the agreement on the new government represents the latest of 
several dramatic concessions the communists have made in the last 
two months in the face of the growing prodemocracy movement these 
include a loosening of travel restrictions the resignation of the 
communist leadership of milos jakes and the end of the communists 
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power 
havel spoke after holding his first talks with communist party 
chief karel urbanek who he said agreed with the oppositions 
position that young able people and experts who are not 
discredited should be brought into the government 
after his 75minute meeting with urbanek havel and other 
opposition leaders met briefly with adamec who is trying to form a 
new cabinet after a coalition government he named sunday ran into 
fierce popular resistance 
the opposition spurned that government because it brought in 
just five noncommunists and left communists in control of all key 
ministries 
the opposition has threatened a general strike on monday if a 
new federal government is not named by sunday 
havel said adamec will consult thursday with representatives of 
other increasingly independent official parties on forming a new 
government 
the opposition will then learn the names of the new cabinet 
friday 
both the government and the opposition have refused to disclose 
details of their negotiations opposition sources said the talks 
envisage some form of powersharing before the free elections the 
opposition wants held by july 
havel who only a month ago was a banned playwright reviled in 
the official press said urbanek admitted during their 
unprecedented meeting that his communist party faces deeply 
rooted mistrust and must change 
but urbanek told the opposition he has trouble convincing some 
regional party leaders of this havel said havel said urbanek 
requested a second meeting thursday with cameras from staterun 
television present 
the opposition leader did not say whether such a session would 
take place or whether it would be carried live on television 
urbanek also assured the opposition that the partys unpopular 
paramilitary force the peoples militia has been completely 
disarmed by the army and will probably be incorporated into the 
armed forces 
urbanek also admitted that the czechoslovak secret police has 
lost all its purpose for internal matters havel said he did not 
elaborate 
as the talks between urbanek and havel broke up the communist 
party chief could be heard telling actor milan knazko an 
opposition leader in slovakia the most important thing now is to 
calm peoples emotions so that we dont have a food rationing 
system tomorrow 
this appeared to be a reference to the possibility of economic 
chaos if the political crisis is not resolved soon 
the opposition scored a victory tuesday when a parliamentary 
commission named jakes and former prague communist boss miroslav 
stepan as politically responsible for a police crackdown on 
peaceful students nov 17 
the commission recommended that both men be stripped of their 
last political posts as parliamentary deputies 
but the staterun news agency ctk quoted jakes as saying today 
i fully reject political responsibility for the events of nov 
17 1989 because the political decision was not to act against the 
participants of the demonstration any other statement is not true 
and is guided by political ambitions 
that crackdown spurred a week of enormous unrest that culminated 
in the ouster of jakes and some of his allies 
the naming of politicians and police held responsible for the 
crackdown was a chief demand of the striking students who started 
czechoslovakias massive prodemocracy movement rolling just two 
weeks ago 
also on tuesday a cabinet was named to rule the czech region of 
the country that left communists in the minority for the first time 
since 1948 
this could serve as a model for a new federal government to 
replace the 21member federal cabinet named on sunday that 
government brought in just five noncommunists and left communists 
in control of all key ministries 
the opposition has threatened a general strike on monday if a 
new federal government is not named by the weekend

attorney general dick thornburgh overruled a 
staff recommendation when he ordered a preliminary inquiry into 
allegations of wrongdoing against former housing secretary samuel 
r pierce jr a spokesman said today 
the justice departments public integrity section recommended 
against considering whether an independent counsel should 
investigate the allegations of political favoritism and perjury 
against pierce said spokesman david runkel 
that decision was reversed by the attorney general after his 
further personal review said runkel confirming an account in 
the washington post 
runkel dismissed suggestions that thornburgh ordered the 
additional inquiry to avoid charges from congress that he had 
scuttled an investigation of a man with whom he sat in president 
reagans cabinet 
he was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further 
investigation the spokesman said he wasnt convinced by the 
public integrity sections point of view 
thornburghs decision made last saturday triggered a 60day 
preliminary inquiry to determine if he should seek court 
appointment of an independent counsel formerly known as a special 
prosecutor to conduct a full criminal investigation 
democratic congressmen alleged last month that pierce awarded 
department of housing and urban development grants on the basis of 
political favoritism and lied under oath during congressional 
hearings last spring 
they cited testimony pierce gave to the house government 
operations employment and housing subcommittee that he did not have 
handson involvement in the award of hud grants to politically 
connected developers 
the 19 lawmakers all members of the house judiciary committee 
triggered procedures under the independent counsel law by 
forwarding their allegations to thornburgh 
in response to the lawmakers request thornburgh disclosed 
monday that he had ordered the preliminary inquiry 
pierce has denied any wrongdoing but twice refused to give 
additional testimony to the house subcommittee citing his 
constitutional right against selfincrimination 
pierces lawyers have contended that the lawmakers had not 
provided the justice department with any specific and credible 
evidence that their client committed a crime 
the public integrity section applying that standard as outlined 
in the independent counsel law apparently agreed with that view 
earlier this week pierces lawyers expressed confidence that 
the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an 
independent counsel

the miami herald on the malta summit 
president bushs summation of his malta meeting with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev was right on the mark i 
couldnt have asked he said for a better result from this 
nonsummit summit nor could anyone 
their eight hours of talks did not resolve all the issues that 
separate the united states and the soviet union nobody expected 
them to 
it was hoped though that the malta talks would establish a 
tone for future relations between the two leaders articulate some 
generalized expectations and set forth specific areas on which 
substantive formal agreements might be signed at their summit in 
washington next june 
all three objectives were met in full

orange county calif register on chinese student visas 
president bushs decision to veto a bill that would guarantee 
visa extensions to 60000 chinese students in the united states was 
a betrayal of our deepest values 
the chinese student leaders who pleaded publicy with president 
bush to sign this bill took a risk few americans would 
understand since the violent crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in tienanmen square the chinese government has monitored 
news reports worldwide to identify dissenters 
leaders of the tienanmen square demonstrations still in china 
are now being punished for their presumption the luckiest have 
only been run out of school and face a life of slave labor many 
have been arrested and tortured some have been shot 
the chinese immigration act passed overwhelmingly by congress 
would have given the chinese students nothing but time no money 
no special benefits just a fouryear visa extension 
perhaps during that time the freedom movement in china would 
make enough progress that it would be safe to return 
the president said the bill was unnecessary because he plans to 
offer the same provisions through administrative rather than 
legislative means the state department and the administration 
claim they werent influenced by the fact but the chinese 
government was livid about the bill and threatened to cancel 
studentexchange programs 
by caving in to beijings whims the administration sends a 
message that the united states is so eager to restore relations on 
cozy premassacre terms that it will hold hostage these brave 
students who represent the best hope that democracy may someday be 
possible in mainland china 
president bush has demonstrated that his sympathies lie more 
with chinas dictators than with her freedom fighters he 
deserves our scorn

philadelphia daily news on the auto industry 
in case youve been wondering why the american automobile 
industry has gone over the edge despite the best efforts of great 
businessmen like lee iacocca the washington post 
pinpointed the reason 
its not the american autoworker maligned over the past several 
years as overpaid unproductive and all kinds of other slanders 
nope american autoworkers are making cars so well there are lines 
forming for them all over japan where automobile quality is almost 
a cult 
the trouble is somewhere else altogether the trouble starts 
with the very same people whining about unfair competition and 
about those allegedly lax american workers the trouble is the 
imbeciles who run american automobile companies the guys who beg 
government bailouts and mourn the passing of the tailfin 
toyota nissan honda and mitsubishi all have plants here those 
plants are full of american workers making cars 
back home in japan people actually want those cars many of 
them actually prefer those cars so there are plans to ship at 
least 163000 cars to japan annually in a couple of years us 
workers are making japanese cars to ship to japanese buyers 
that doesnt sound like the problem is us workers 
sounds like the problem is us managers too bad we cant 
export them to japan

its good to see that older workers are getting some of the 
respect they deserve from employers 
a survey released by the american association of retired 
persons shows that employers have raised their opinion of older 
workers since the last aarp survey was taken four years ago 
they were particularly impressed with the work ethic displayed 
by older workers their ability to handle pressure situations and 
the experience they bring to the job 
older workers are often some of the most pleasant and useful 
employees to be found in businesses its good to see that firms

argus leader sioux falls sd on postal delivery service 
anytime the us postal service surveys customers or takes other 
steps supposedly designed to improve service we cant help but 
fear that service is about to get worse or that another rate hike 
is coming 
well the us postal service is at it again and were worried 
more than a year ago the postal service started what sioux 
falls postmaster thomas skolak has described in letters as a major 
review of customers needs for postal products and services 
no rate hike is involved but delivery service is likely to 
change 
beginning next spring some letters that may have reached their 
destination in two days may take three days meanwhile letters 
that are only supposed to take one day or two days to deliver 
should meet deadlines with greater regularity 
consider us cynical if you want but were still uneasy the 
use of a survey smacks of a ploy to justify reduced delivery 
standards

police today confirmed the 
arrest of five suspected members of a rightist group that had 
planned bombings and other terrorist acts 
human rights activists expressed concern that the arrests might 
be part of an attempt to divert attention from recent allegations 
of death squads within the ranks of the national police force 
max coleman of the human rights commission a private group led 
by antiapartheid activists said the government might try to 
convey the impression that fanatical rightwingers rather than 
elements of the security forces were the main culprits in a series 
of unsolved attacks on government opponents 
police said the five men were arrested tuesday in the 
johannesburg area and that they ranged in age from 28 to 40 police 
refused to disclose their names saying that could jeopardize the 
prospects for further arrests 
they said a large quantity of weapons ammunition and explosives 
was seized during the investigation 
a police statement said the men were being held for questioning 
about various bombings and other terrorists acts involving a 
rightwing group but gave no further details 
local newspapers quoted unidentified police sources as saying 
the men apparently belonged to a group that had broken away from 
the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement 
s the pearshaped stringed instrument to promote arabic 
music around the world and to bridge a culture gap but he 
believes that one of his biggest tasks in life is to instill a love 
of arabic music among youngsters who have been seduced by western 
rock and disco music and preserve a rich artistic heritage 
its a shame he said in an interview we have such great 
music but the younger generations never heed it 
bashir a native of mosul in northern iraq said that for arabs 
to neglect their traditional music is to ignore an important aspect 
of their cultural identity 
music is part of the cultural identity of any people its not 
something you can borrow from others he said music is not 
just entertainment its a source of spiritual and moral 
uplifting 
bashir 59 believes arabic music is now in a state of crisis 
which he attributes to cultural backwardness 
as director of musical affairs at the culture ministry in 
baghdad he has devoted 16 years to promoting arabic music as part 
of iraqs educational system and culture 
bashire established a ballet and music school for children to 
study and learn to play instruments and the iraqi institute of 
melody studies for teenagers 
three years ago he formed the albayariq ensemble a 28member 
youth group to develop young peoples interest in authentic arabic 
music and to help preserve centuriesold songs that have begun to 
disappear because of the ugly thrust of modern music it is led 
by his youngest son omer 20 
its not just a source of pride but an investment in our 
cultural future bashir said if we dont encourage young 
people to play these instruments our traditional music will die 
and these instruments will only be found in museums 
albayariq brings together the oud qanun santur and joza all 
stringed instrumemnts as well as the tablah a small drum and the 
riqq a frame drum with jingles akin to a tambourine 
the oud is a sixstringed instrument shaped like a lute bashir 
believes the oud originated in iraq the instrument has been seen 
on stone carvings dating back 2000 years from arabia the oud 
made its way to europe possibly in the moorish conquest of spain 
and from it evolved the lute 
the qanun is a zitherlike instrument the violinlike joza has 
only one string that gives a strong high pitch it is played 
resting on the leg rather than nestling under the chin the santure 
is something like a qanun but its strings are played with sticks 
rather than a bow 
the instruments used by the ensemble are specially made for the 
group by elderly craftsmen in a workshop set up by bashir 
the ensemble has performed in several foreign countries 
including france and all over the arab world in paris the 
youngsters performed at the arab world institute to standing 
ovations 
now weve built a solid base i hope these kids will stick to 
their instruments pioneering the way for others to follow 
bashir said 
arabic music has largely been ignored in the west because of its 
complex melodies and ornamental flourishes that make it difficult 
to grasp but artists such as bashir are increasingly bridging the 
cultural gap 
critics hail him as a creative and supreme master of his 
instrument whose music springs from the authentic tradition of 
arabian music foreign critics say bashir is notable for being able 
to project the emotions of arabic music often lost to the 
occidential ear to nonarabs 
he stretches the understanding of music to the limit one 
european critic wrote to listen to him takes as much 
intellectual energy and attention as listening to the discourse of 
a sage 
his playing is rooted in classical arab forms but is largely 
improvisational some critics have found it resembles progressive 
jazz in many ways 
bashir has elevated the oud to solo instrument status after 
centuries of having been used to accompany arab singers for one 
thing he added six more strings pairing them with the others to 
produce a fuller sound and melodic flexibility 
he discovered his gift for music when he was 6 years old while 
listening to his mother singing lullabies to his younger brothers 
she also played several traditional instruments 
she was my first idol she breathed the love of music into 
me he said 
his father made ouds and bashirs brother also plays the 
instrument 
in his ministry office crowded with musical instruments 
records and tapes he spends two to three hours a day playing no 
one is allowed to interrupt him 
all telephone calls and appointments have to be put off when 
alistath the master is playing until he finishes his solo 
performance in his office said his secretary nizar jawad who 
is also a lyricist and musician

a former university of minnesota 
administrator was sentenced today to 18 months in state prison for 
stealing 186000 from the universitys office of minority and 
special student affairs 
luther darville was convicted last month of three felony counts 
of theft by swindle 
he said all the missing money was doled out to needy athletes 
and other students on instructions from his superiors who 
testified they had no knowledge of the payments 
hennepin county district judge patrick fitzgerald sentenced him 
to 18 months in prison on one count 15 months on the second count 
and one year and one day on the third count to run concurrently 
said the judges law clerk john conley darville will get credit 
for time already served nearly four months conley said 
in addition fitzgerald sentenced darville to six months at the 
county workhouse for contempt of court to be served after the 
prison sentence 
the position of trust that mr darville had at the university 
of minnesota was violated he said the offenses were committed 
with a high degree of planning over an extended and lengthy period 
of time 
prosecutor pete connors had sought a minimum sentence of 54 
months saying darville had deceived the very students he was 
supposed to be counseling and had made false allegations against 
his colleagues 
defense attorney james lawton argued for leniency noting that 
darville has no previous criminal record and will be deported to 
his native bahamas

seattle postintelligencer on the exxon valdez captain 
attorneys for joseph j hazelwood skipper of the illfated 
exxon valdez have come up with a criminal defense that is well 
interesting 
as a result of the tanker running aground march 24 in alaskas 
prince william sound spilling nearly 11 million gallons of oil 
the captain faces three felony and three misdemeanor charges in 
anchorage 
heres his attorneys pitch because hazelwood radioed in to the 
coast guard that his tanker was leaking oil he had incriminated 
himself presumably without aid of counsel or having been advised 
of his miranda rights 
dont like that one try this one 
because of state and federal laws that grant immunity to people 
who report oil spills the fact that hazelwood radioed the coast 
guard that the tanker had run aground and was leaking some oil 
made him an oilspill reporter and therefore subject to immunity 
hazelwood a whistleblower on whom himself

the clarionledger jackson miss on garbage disposal and 
racketeers 
do americans want to depend on racketeers to take care of their 
garbage 
thats another element of the problem of solid waste disposal 
that must be considered as landfills are being exhausted and the 
volume of refuse mounts 
public hearings last month in philadelphia revealed the east 
coast crime families that have long dominated the wastedisposal 
industry in new york and new jersey through intimidation and murder 
already have branched out into pennsylvania they are expected to 
look next at the midwest and possibly the south 
the threat is more alarming because it comes at a time when the 
nation is approaching a crisis on solid waste disposal the risk to 
public safety is becoming increasingly clear particularly as mob 
muscle can be applied to achieve monopoly control of the industry 
profits in the industry can be enormous waste disposal is not a 
field in which many businessmen are interested 
states are fighting back through laws requiring background 
investigations of waste haulers and landfill operations in an 
effort to block mob control however a cooperative interregional 
response may be needed as will some federal assistance 
the gangster threat only further underlines the fact that an 
effective overall response to the solid waste problem must be 
implemented and soon public health is at stake and if a crunch 
comes the public must avoid the additional threat of being at the 
mercy of the mob

grants pass ore daily courier on tv news recreations 
why all the fuss about television networks using dramatic 
recreations of news events 
in july abc news touched off a furor by broadcasting a 
dramatization with actors of american diplomat felix blochs 
supposed exchange of documents with a soviet citizen critics said 
the sequence blurred the line between reality and dramatics a line 
that television news should regard as holy 
these folks take television news too seriously 
they applauded nbcs decision to join abc in promising not 
to use such dramatizations their criticism turned to cbs which 
steadfastly refuses to change more power to cbs whose defiant 
stance proclaims what the socalled critics refuse to admit that 
television news is entertainment pure and simple 
television spreads the image not the word better than any 
other medium and some images will never die 
the boob tube can be incredibly amusing transporting us from 
berlin to las vegas taking us from zsa zsa gabor to president 
bush moving us from laughter to tears 
while abc and nbc continue their impossible quest for a news 
program beyond the boundaries of entertainment the rest of us can 
turn to cbs where television news is lauded for what it really is 
a nightly halfhour of informative escapism

researchers at the pittsburgh cancer institute 
will conduct a fiveyear study of the rate at which some people who 
receive transplanted organs develop cancer 
in the process the 5 million study funded by the national 
cancer institute may provide clues to the relationship between 
cancer and viruses and the way in which the body combats those 
diseases one official said tuesday 
it has broad implications for better understanding of 
mechanisms that lead to the development of cancer said dr 
theresa whiteside director of the institutes immunologic 
monitoring and diagnostic laboratory and a professor of pathology 
at the university of pittsburgh 
about 400 adults and children who have received transplants will 
be recruited to participate in the study 
whiteside said one of the most significant aspects of the study 
is that researchers will be able to study a large group of people 
some of whom they know will develop cancer 
it will build on observations made in 1975 by pittsburgh liver 
transplant pioneer dr thomas starzl who discovered when he was at 
the university of colorado that 2 to 3 percent of all transplant 
recipients developed cancer 
the most common malignancies diagnosed among those patients were 
lymph node cancer liver cancer and kaposis sarcoma a skin cancer 
also common among aids patients 
starzl along with dr israel penn also found that the risk of 
cancer after a transplant increased to 10 percent for patients 
whose pretransplant tests showed they did not have antibodies to 
the epstein barr virus which causes mononucleosis 
about 80 percent of those patients become infected with the 
virus after transplantation and researchers believe there is some 
correlation between that and the development of cancer 
particularly in the lymph nodes 
researchers also will try to determine why liver transplant 
recipients whose previous liver was removed because of cancer often 
develop the cancer again with the new organ 
in such patients the cancer does not show up in other parts of 
the body 
we are not even sure if it is the same cancer that returns to 
the new liver or a new cancer that arises in the liver nothing is 
known about this she said 
the return of cancer whiteside said must have something to do 
with a persons immune system after transplantation or the immune 
defenses within the liver itself 
transplant patients get drugs to suppress their bodys natural 
defenses after surgery to prevent rejection of the new organs and 
the drugs also make the patients susceptible to other infections

a federal jury today convicted a 24yearold 
man of operating a 2 millionaweek cocainedistribution network 
in the nations capital a verdict that mandates life imprisonment 
rayful edmond iii was found guilty of all seven counts against 
him after more than four days of deliberations that capped a 
12week trial ten codefendants were convicted of related charges 
during the 20 minutes that the verdicts were read the 11 
defendants stood impassively before us district judge charles 
richey occasionally glancing down at the floor or shaking their 
heads slowly as the guilty verdicts mounted the jury returned an 
innocent verdict on only one of the 23 counts in the indictment 
edmond of washington stood stoically throughout the 
proceeding his hands folded in front of him and a serious 
expression on his face 
the charges against him included conspiracy to violate narcotics 
laws employing persons under 18 to possess and distribute cocaine 
traveling across state lines to sell drugs and using a telephone to 
set up illegal drug deals 
convictions on those counts satisfy a definition of a continuing 
criminal enterprise a crime which carries a mandatory life 
sentence 
edmonds codefendants who include an aunt a sister a brother 
and several close friends were found guilty of assisting him 
prosecutors said at the trial that the drug ring accounted for up 
to 30 percent of the district of columbias cocaine market 
richey did not immediately set a sentencing date 
the verdicts ended a complex courtroom drama in which 
prosecutors depicted edmond as the head of a vast and deadly drug 
network that took in 2 million a week 
the trial was unusual from the outset when the judge ruled that 
the names of jurors would be kept secret even from himself and 
lawyers to protect them from possible reprisals 
the home of one witness mother was firebombed during the trial 
an informant was shot after being accidentally exposed by the 
prosecution the trial was conducted in a courtroom with a 
bulletproof plastic shield 1 inches thick and further protection 
was provided by a metal detector set up for the trial outside the 
courtroom in which the case was argued 
at its peak last summer prosecutors said edmond and his 
cohorts moved up to 440 pounds of cocaine per week into washington 
the city has experienced more than 400 homicides this year most of 
them attributed by police to drug activities 
edmond was described by prosecutors as a flashy entrepreneur who 
lavished expensive gifts including luxury automobiles on 
friends family members and loyal lieutenants in his organization 
edmonds lawyers said the government had not proved its case 
against him 
in closing arguments last thursday defense attorney james 
robinson challenged the credibility of prosecution witnesses 
saying evidence against some of the codefendants did not point to 
edmond as the leader of a drug enterprise 
there was a lot of testimony from a lot of people who got 
caught dealing drugs robinson said the problem was making 
a connection between that activity and rayful edmond iii 
edmond is charged with additional crimes including three 
counts of firstdegree murder and conspiracy counts and is 
expected to face two more trials

seven months before new hampshire cast the 
ninth and deciding vote to ratify the us constitution in 1788 
the governor had 400 copies printed so voting delegates could read 
it 
all were thought to have been lost until michael munroe 
president of the newbury historical society found one last spring 
in papers in the vault in the old town hall the vault was filled 
with papers from the legislature that the town had given to the 
historical society 
state archivist frank mevers confirmed the document was one of 
the copies printed by john melcher at the direction of gov john 
sullivan 
were 100 percent sure this document was printed in december 
of 1787 mevers said the types of paper the handwriting ink 
and print all convinced him of the documents authenticity 
whether new hampshire would ratify the constitution was in doubt 
in the months before the vote supporters called federalists said 
a strong government was needed to provide stability and pull the 
country out of economic recession 
opponents said the constitution would lay the groundwork for the 
kind of tyrannical central government they had fought in the 
revolution 
after months of proconstitution lobbying federalists won 
ratification with a 5747 vote in concord on june 21 1788 
mevers said the documents value isnt certain and the only way 
to determine that would be by auction but munroe said the 
historical society in the town of about 1000 residents plans to 
keep it 
wed like to have it displayed he said wed like to be 
able to have people see it but we dont have the facility to do 
that 
he said its possible the society could loan the document to the 
state historical society museum

some faculty members at massachusetts institute of 
technology are upset that a physicist who publicly supported 
researchers claims of achieving cold fusion may win tenure a 
newspaper reported today 
at mit where millions of dollars have been spent on research 
into conventional fusion as a potential energy source many 
scientists challenged a report of cold fusion energy but peter l 
hagelstein defended it 
cold fusion was envisioned as a source of limitless energy last 
spring when utah researcher b stanley pons and martin fleischmann 
of great britain said their experiment fused hydrogen atoms without 
the high temperatures believed necessary for such a reaction 
at a news conference april 14 hagelstein theorized that a 
previously unknown nuclear phenomenon was involved in cold fusion 
and mit filed for a patent on potential applications of his ideas 
but other mit physicists scoffed at the idea and chemists said 
hagelstein did not understand that a chemical rather than 
physical reaction might have occurred other laboratories were 
unable to reproduce the utah results 
the boston globe said it was told by unidentified sources at mit 
that tenure for hagelstein 34 has support in his department of 
electrical engineering but that the way he got mit into the cold 
fusion controversy has become an issue 
critics said it was not so much his theory as the way it was 
presented through the news media rather than submitting it to 
review by scientists the globe said

riot police arrested four leftist radicals 
wednesday for throwing firebombs to protest the expansion of 
tokyos international airport officials said 
protesters hurled firebombs and bricks at riot police from four 
50foot towers erected at the site by the demonstrators police 
eventually overpowered them with water cannons 
riot police lowered steel cages over the towers to prevent them 
from hurling more projectiles 
about 200 radical opponents of the airport rallied nearby to 
protest the police action but did not clash with them the official 
said 
seven radicals have been arrested since monday when about 5000 
riot police began to remove one of 10 huts built illegally on the 
site of the planned second runway of the new tokyo international 
airport 40 miles northeast of tokyo the chiba prefectural police 
said 
eight farmers own land on or near the planned expansion site 
refusing to yield it for construction of additional runways to ease 
congestion 
the airport handled 1724 million passengers in 1988 4 million 
more than it was originally designed for the airport authority 
said 
fortyeight airlines from 37 countries use the 25 billion 
airport which opened in 1978 with just one runway 
by next year the government plans to build two more runways 
one of 8250 feet and another of 10560 feet 
antigovernment radicals have been supporting the farmers in 
their battle to keep their land from being taken from them for the 
new runways 
on monday transport minister takami eto became the first 
government official to apologize for the states failure to consult 
adequately with farmers when the airport first was planned 23 years 
ago

the palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip has taken a heavy toll 
in the past two years 
casualties on both sides have mounted as the intefadeh 
arabic for uprising drags on without political solution 
more than 820 people have died according to a tally kept by the 
associated press 
they include 626 palestinians killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians and 154 palestinians slain by fellow arabs most on 
suspicion of collaboration with israel fortythree israelis have 
died in the violence including 11 soldiers 
the palestinian fatalities include 132 children says the israel 
information center for human rights in the occupied territories 
thousands have been wounded 
according to the un relief and works agency which oversees 
relief programs for palestinian refugees nearly 40000 
palestinians have suffered injuries ranging from tear gas 
inhalation to beatings and gunshot wounds the army puts the 
palestinian injury total at 8926 
the army spokesmans office says 2438 israelis have been 
wounded including 1635 soldiers 
sixty palestinians have been deported and about 40000 jailed in 
the past two years there are 9142 in prison now including 1562 
administrative detainees held without charge or trial 
both sides have lost economically too 
nahum lev chief economist at bank hapoalim estimated israels 
economic growth in 1989 was reduced by about onehalf percent 
about 200 million because of business disruptions and trade 
losses stemming from the uprising 
the toll in the first year was about 600 million israeli 
economists estimated 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the size of the gross 
national product has shrunk by at least 25 percent from about 15 
billion in 1987 to about 1125 billion now awartani estimated 
gnp is a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy 
people are suffering said hisham awartani a leading 
palestinian economist im not optimistic about 1990 either 
lev believes the impact on israel is decreasing because the 
economy has more or less adjusted to new realities 
he noted for example that many companies are hiring israelis 
to replace palestinians who often missed work because of strikes 
or other uprisingrelated problems 
the israeli workers are more expensive but they produce more 
so output is rising lev said 
in the west bank and gaza strip agriculture construction and 
service industries are suffering awartani said the only bright 
spot is industry 
hundreds of factories have sprung up he said some are 
cottage industries but many are real factories employing 20 or 30 
people 
the palestinian factories are finding a ready market because of 
the uprising boycott of israelimade goods but awartani said the 
fledgling industries will have to worry about quality and price 
competition if they are going to survive

president bush ruled out at the malta summit a 
proposal from soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to restrict the 
superpowers navies including removing nuclear weapons from 
surface warships the white house said today 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush told gorbachev 
it was unacceptable to us because the united states is a naval 
power we depend upon the seas for contact with all of our allies 
and with other continents of the world 
the soviet union is a landbased power but the navy is 
crucial to us in terms of maintaining all of our commitments around 
the world maintaining open sea lanes and commercial lanes around 
the world he said 
it simply is so key and vital to our basic role in world 
military affairs as well as commercial affairs that we cannot 
consider that the spokesman said adding that i dont detect 
any flexibility at this point on the issue 
gorbachev expressed concern at the weekend summit that his 
country was surrounded by us naval power and even gave bush a 
kgbproduced map of us installations to hammer home the point 
he would like to see reductions in the naval forces said 
fitzwater 
he gave us the chart the map we made some jokes that wed 
fill in the blanks and that was about it the white house 
spokesman added 
the white house also announced today that bush is delegating 
deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger to coordinate 
us support to eastern europe including the recently passed 938 
million in aid for poland and hungary 
bush met in the oval office today with former italian prime 
minister bettino craxi 
craxi prime minister from 1983 to 1987 as head of the italian 
socialist party said after the meeting that the malta summit gave 
a further impulse to the changes taking place in europe 
craxi was also visiting congressional leaders and receiving an 
honorary degree from catholic university 
the white house denied on tuesday that there was any difference 
in attitudes toward the soviets between bush and vice president dan 
quayle who said in a newspaper interview that the soviets were a 
totalitarian government that had not changed much in foreign 
policy 
bush in his first public comments since returning to the white 
house from europe on monday told a gop fundraising dinner tuesday 
night that the united states should help spur democratic changes 
inside the soviet union and eastern europe despite persistent 
differences over soviet aid to leftist governments in latin america 
i look at malta as a hopeful step in a new relationship 
bush said 
he told the crowd of 600 at a 1000aplate dinner for the 
republican congressional campaign committee we have some 
differences obviously with past performance of the soviet and 
regrettably im afraid in the future 
but were going to keep on working this i was up front 
about the destabilizing flow of arms into the region from nations 
that are receiving soviet support 
he acknowledged when you go to a meeting of this nature 
theres trepidation people wonder how its going to come out 
we have an administration that is very closely aligned but i 
think it probably not possible for people to speak literally with 
one voice said national security adviser brent scowcroft adding 
there was no difference in the substance of their views 
quayle told knightridder editors and reporters tuesday that 
theres no good guy bad guy strategy between himself and bush 
some conservatives have expressed unhappiness over the summit 
saying that bush gave the soviets economic concessions without 
securing a commitment to keep moscowmade weapons out of central 
america 
at the summit bush endorsed giving moscow observer status at 
the worlds leading economic regulatory body and proposed june as a 
target date for completing a trade agreement granting the soviet 
union mostfavorednation status which would result in an easing 
of trade barriers

all foreign citizens trapped by rebel fighting 
in manila hotels including some 280 americans have been bused to 
safety the white house said today 
the us embassy is working to help these individuals with 
their travel plans said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he said the evacuations were completed without incident all 
americans were reported safe and we have no reports of injuries 
he said 
im very encouraged about that president bush said earlier 
when asked if all the americans were safe 
in manila today president corazon aquino declared a state of 
national emergency but it was unclear what additional powers her 
government would wield with the declaration 
fitzwater declined to comment on the emergency declaration 
other than to say we will take a look at it and see if we have 
any concerns 
state department spokesman mark dillon said earlier today that 
us officials were trying to determine what the emergency 
declaration specifically means 
were still getting reports on what the state of emergency 
declaration includes dillon said adding that there had not been 
any additional requests for american assistance 
on tuesday us embassy and philippine authorities said 164 
americans were out safely and that the evacuation appeared 
complete 
consular officers met 30 buses at a reception center established 
at a shopping center near the airport some 2000 foreigners were 
trapped for four days in hotels by the military coup attempt that 
had killed at least 77 people 
the us response to the drama was decidedly low key tuesday as 
the administration sought to avoid language that could further 
inflame tensions 
the administration suggested the plight of the trapped 
foreigners was not so much a hostage taking as it was the product 
of the ongoing military revolt against mrs aquino 
to us officials the most disquieting aspect of the situation 
were statements by some rebels that the americans might not be 
released to punish the bush administration for its support for the 
aquino government 
state department spokesman richard boucher said there was no 
indication that americans had been singled out for mistreatment 
capt albert yen one of the insurgents reflected the 
sentiments of rebel hardliners when he said the intention is 
not to release americans 
us meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of our 
assault so we hold them liable yen said it is the 
responsibility of the us government if we take their nationals 
hostage 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said tuesday mrs 
aquino had not requested additional us military support

we must remember that the rebellion is not against the 
government or the democratic process alone this is a struggle 
waged against the very people who had installed this leadership 
when we established democracy in our country the people too are 
the intended victim although the government is prepared to deal 
with this fierce strategy decisively our people must join us in 
giving the enemy the final blow 
they just want to grab power they do not think whether they 
will inflict suffering on the filipino people how many innocent 
civilians were killed they did not think that lives of filipinos 
matter the constant preoccupation is finding ways wherein they can 
rule and have power 
we still remember what martial law was like those people we 
suspect are involved in what is happening now to our country these 
same peole believe they are the only ones who have power during 
martial law we didnt have a duly ratified constitution we didnt 
have press freedom during those times when somebody wrote or said 
something against the government they were arrested and sometimes 
even killed 
i am telling you now that i have put so much at stake for 
democracy i have lost my husband in 1983 he was killed many of 
us suffered and until now we have put our lives at stake 
you know what happened last friday when rockets were fired at 
malacanang what did these people want it is very clear that these 
people want to kill me to eliminate me so that they can rule our 
land what they have forgotten is that power is not theirs to take 
they cannot just grab power by killing people they have to 
understnd that power belongs to you my beloved countrymen why did 
i become president that was because you believed in me and in 
spite of all of the coup attempts you have stuck by me and i know 
that i owe my being president to you 
i did not think of being president i just wanted to serve you 
i just wanted to restore democracy i want to respect your rights 
i am only asking you to help me you are my only source of strength 
to continue our reforms in government i also depend on you to see 
for yourself what these people are doing to us 
show our enemies that we the filipino people love our coutnry 
we do not want these killings we reject these people whose only 
concern is their own interest you my beloved countrymen i depend 
on you

testing service to reschedule a graduate test cancel an english 
proficiency test and wipe out the test scores of nearly 3000 
students 
ets spokesman ray nicosia said it was uncertain if the cheating 
announced wednesday was the largestscale breach of standardized 
test security ever but such cases have rarely extended beyond a 
single class school or test center 
nicosia said ets based in princeton nj had received about 
50 letters from indian students and test center supervisors 
indicating that students had been able to buy copies of the 
standardized tests before the administration dates 
ets said it had learned that test materials had been improperly 
obtained in advance by students for the oct 28 test of english as 
a foreign language this prompted cancellation of exams at five 
centers in the bangalore area affecting 620 students according to

the language exam taken annually by 500000 students worldwide 
including 21500 indian students is designed to evaluate english 
proficiency in students whose native language is not english it is 
used for admission by 3000 north american colleges and 
universities 
an investigation also found students were able to buy copies of 
the graduate record examination before taking last months test 
the test is taken primarily by college students to enter 
graduate school most of the approximately 14000 indian students 
who take the gre each year are trying to gain admittance to us 
graduate schools 
ets which administers standardized tests in 170 countries said 
it had canceled the scores of 2744 of 4280 test takers for the 
gre administered oct 14 at 17 of 27 indian test centers

dirt floor of a unsupplied tent wednesday talking to relatives 
and neighbors about her home of 25 years that was destroyed by the 
israeli army overnight 
in mrs shukris case as for many of the 244 families whose 
homes have been demolished by israel in the twoyear palestinian 
uprising the sins of a son were behind her troubles 
her youngest son 26yearold ahmed is accused of trying to 
force a crowded israeli bus over a cliff in september police say 
shukri also confessed to murdering an israeli coworker at a tel 
aviv construction site and led police to the body 
israeli military officials maintain demolishing or sealing 
houses is necessary to deter violence international human rights 
groups call it collective punishment that violates conventions on 
the treatment of refugees 
mrs shukri a 55yearold widow says it is unfair and 
ineffective as a deterrent 
i told them he doesnt own anything in the house its my 
house but they didnt care she said 
we lost everything we lost our house what else do we have to 
lose she asked 
the shukri family pitched the tent next to the ruins of the 
sixroom twostory house they built in 1964 living in the house 
with mrs shukri were her three daughters two older sons and their 
pregnant wives and two granddaughters 
ahmed shukri also lived there until his arrest in the bus 
attack which was thwarted by passengers after shukri had stabbed 
the driver 
his eldest brother mahmoud says his only regret is that ahmed 
did not succeed in plunging the bus off the tel avivjerusalem 
highway 
i think he did the right thing said the 31yearold 
blacksmith if he had succeeded in what he planned to do and died 
a martyr it would have been better 
mahmoud said he hates the israelis who have occupied this west 
bank town of 25000 since the 1967 middle east war he valued his 
familys lost home at 120000 
the family says they will spend their days in the undonated 
tent furnished with a battered sofa from their house during the 
winter they plan to sleep in neighbors homes where some of their 
other furniture is stored 
mrs shukri said she doesnt have the money to rent a house or 
rebuild but she added she accepted the loss 
if we need a state this is the price even if we have to give 
all our houses for palestine she said 
the army demolished two other homes of suspected palestinian 
attackers wednesday both in the gaza strips jebaliya refugee 
camp one home in gaza was sealed raising the numbers of sealed 
houses to 117 since the start of the uprising against israeli rule 
on dec 8 1987

the strain of a sixday coup attempt 
showed upon the face of corazon aquino as she appealed wednesday 
for her people to stand behind her in the gravest crisis faced by 
her 3year administration 
mrs aquino made the appeal in her first nationally televised 
appearance since sunday when she told military mutineers to 
surrender or die 
but on wednesday it was a different cory aquino gone was 
the steely uncompromising firmness that marked not only the sunday 
speech but other addresses she has delivered during five previous 
coup attempts 
this time her eyes were swollen and her face was drawn she 
stared plaintively into the camera like a woman who had been 
betrayed 
i did not think of being president mrs aquino said i 
just wanted to serve you i just wanted to restore democracy i 
want to respect your rights i am only asking you to help me 
in previous crises mrs aquino delivered speeches in the crisp 
monotone of a teacher lecturing an errant pupil she prefers to 
make speeches in english an official language in the philippines 
on wednesday however she spoke in tagalog a native language 
better understood by ordinary filipinos her choice of words and 
the manner of speaking exuded more desperation than confidence 
i am telling you now that i have put so much at stake for 
democracy she said raising her arms slightly i lost my 
husband many of us suffered and until now we have put our 
lives at stake 
mrs aquinos husband benigno aquino jr was slain in 1983 as 
he stepped from a jet after arriving in manila from the united 
states to challenge the late president ferdinand marcos for 
leadership of the country 
ordinarily mrs aquino reads speeches carefully crafted by her 
staff this time she appeared tobe speaking extemporaneuosly and 
from the heart 
why did i become president mrs aquino asked that was 
because you believed in me and in spite of all of the coup 
attempts you have stuck by me and i know that i owe my being 
president to you

the white house today defended its decision to 
name a panamanian as acting administrator of the panama canal 
against criticism that it disrupts the treaty rules for eventually 
transferring control of the waterway to panama 
we think this was the correct course of action white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said in replying to charges by members 
of the political opposition in panama 
the treaties require that a panamanian take charge as 
administrator of the canal on jan 1 1990 for the first time in 
the 75year history of the waterway the treaties also stipulate 
that it is up to the government of panama to nominate a canal 
administrator then for the us president to appoint him subject 
to senate confirmation 
but the united states refuses to recognize the government put in 
power by gen manuel antonio noriega and has spurned its choice 
for the post on a permanent basis 
fitzwater said the us decision to name an acting administrator 
reflects the political realities of the situation and allows 
uninterrupted compliance with the treaty and continued 
operation of the canal without introducing a new political figure 
in here that would result in political turmoil 
bush announced tuesday he has asked the canals deputy 
administrator fernando manfredo to take over as acting 
administrator 
i have accepted because i consider it the only responsible 
option under the circumstances manfredo said in a written 
statement in panama 
opposition leaders warned that bushs action creates an 
irregular situation not foreseen in the treaties 
we warn the united states that because of its irregularity 
this situation disrupts the orderly process of nationalization of 
the canal that we panamanians claim as an irreversible process 
said the statement from former opposition presidential candidate 
guillermo endara and his vice presidential running mates ricardo 
arias and guillermo ford 
the man recommended by the panamanian government for the job 
tomas altamiranoduque directorpresident of panamas biggest 
newspaper and a former lawmaker for the democratic revolutionary 
party published a letter in his newspaper last month saying 
manfredo would be guilty of treason if he accepted the position 
manfredo commerce minister under the late panamanian leader 
omar torrijos said in his statement i am confident that when 
emotions are cooled down all will agree that i did the right 
thing 
there was no official government comment 
the white house said a permanent appointment would be made at 
such time as a legitimate panamanian government exists and proposes 
its candidate for administrator in accordance with the procedures 
set forth in the treaty and applicable law 
as this step demonstrates the us is committed to meeting 
the requirements of the panama canal treaty even under current 
circumstances in which no legitimate government authority exists in 
panama white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement 
manfredo would succeed dennis mcauliffe a former commander of 
us military forces in panama who has been administrator of the 
canal commission for a decade 
the treaty also requires that an american be named deputy 
administrator in 1990 the white house said that decision will be 
made later by the board of directors of the canal commission 
the transfer of power to panama will be completed at the end of 
the century when panama assumes full control of the canal 
bush announced last week he is banning panamanianflag vessels 
from entering us ports after jan 31 it is the latest step to 
bring economic pressure on the central american nation to force the 
ouster of noriega wanted in the united states on drug racketeering 
charges

the new interim head of state and that he will serve until 
parliament elects a permanant president 
his announcement came shortly after the official media said egon 
krenz the former communist party chief had resigned as head of 
state 
the staterun news agency adn announced it had indications that 
people were storming army installations and it appealed for the 
prodemocracy movement to remain calm during the political crisis 
in the last few hours there have been growing indications of 
stormings of facilities and installations of the national peoples 
army the government said in a statement distributed by adn 
it did not specify where the assaults were taking place or say 
how many people were involved the government called for calm and 
restraint 
on tuesday angry citizens began surrounding and in some cases 
forcing their way into buildings housing the secret police in an 
effort to stop the destruction of documents needed in prosecutions 
of former communist officials 
the liberal democrats were long allied with the communist party 
but have since said that they will no longer run in a communistled 
bloc 
gerlach has been spearheading drives for reforms in east germany 
and has been taking on an increasingly prominent role since the 
ouster of hardline communist party leader erich honecker on oct 
18 
the political makeup of east germany which was founded in 1949 
is being shaped by the prodemocracy movement on a daybyday basis 
the country is now run by a 25member committee of communists 
who took over when the communist leadership resigned sunday a 
special party congress will decide on a new party leadership friday 
a noncommunist has never before held the post of president in 
east germany under previous communist governments the post had 
been largely ceremonial but it was unclear whether it would have a 
more important role in the current turmoil shaking the country 
reflecting the political crisis in the country gerlach said he was 
not happy about taking on the new duties 
also today the defense council which commands the armed 
forces resigned krenz who had led the council came to power on 
oct 18 but he was unpopular because of his ties to the previous 
leadership he has now lost all his posts 
he resigned as communist party chief on sunday along with the 
ruling politburo and the entire policymaking central commitee 
the embattled communists who had planned to hold the emergency 
congress on dec 15 will now hold it friday and totally revamp the 
party structure 
reform began in east germany after honecker was forced out 
following 18 years in power since then a popular uprising and 
exodus of thousands of people to the west have forced the communist 
government to open east germanys borders and the berlin wall to 
allow citizens to travel freely 
the communist party also has given up its guaranteed monopoly on 
power 
the swift and wholly unexpected changes have left what many 
people in this country regard as a dangerous power vaccuum in east 
germany 
the official adn news agency said the emergency communist party 
congress on friday will propose a radical reformation of the 
party into a modern socialist party committed to democratic 
socialism 
there already has been widespread talk of renaming the communist 
party while the leadership itself has warned it faces a possible 
breakup 
the congress must make a final break with the stalinist 
system and put the party on an even footing with other political 
forces adn said it said the communists want to elect a leadership 
that will be able to guarantee its full authority as a party with 
equal rights in the reform of society 
no reason was given today for krenzs resignation as president 
the announcement came three days after he quit as communist party 
chief because his ties to former party leaders made him 
unacceptable to the reform movement 
krenz has been virtually without power since stepping down as 
communist party general secretary on sunday 
his ties with past leaders had made him the target of growing 
criticism within the party and among opposition groups he was 
president since oct 24

theres always a warm and boisterous crowd 
upstairs at the crossroads bar but walk in on thursday nights 
gang and youll be stunned by the lively silence 
clinking beer mugs darts hitting a board and an occasional fist 
on the table are the only sounds the banter is carried on with 
fluttering hands and a tap on the wrist by the dozens of deaf and 
hearing impaired who make this back bay neighborhood bar their own 
once a week 
deaf is a small world laurie szynal of fall river said 
through a signing interpreter where else do you go to meet deaf 
people and socialize 
the thursday night gang at crossroads has grown from a few 
friends a few years ago to capacity crowds of 150 to 300 people 
from all over new england who gather each thursday in the 
comfortable collegiate atmosphere for conversation and camaraderie 
visitors to the city also stop by including students from 
gallaudet university in washington dc the nations only 
university for the hearing impaired 
the regulars say its their only alternative to deaf clubs 
which cater to older crowds with bingo games and bridge 
one cold thursday night in november patrons gathered with an 
interpreter around the end of the bar and told how important the 
gathering is to the young deaf community its a time when everyone 
in the bar speaks their language 
brent jolley one of the groups founder now works behind the 
bar on thursday giving signers an advantage any thirsty soul who 
ever called to a barkeep can appreciate 
i can take an order across the room and by the time you get to 
the bar i can have it ready jolley said 
when sabrina dennison a 21yearold from portsmouth nh 
tells her hearing friends shes going to a boston bar they think 
of getting all dolled up to dance and flirt 
thats not the point here she said its to meet old 
friends and deaf people i just dress anyway i feel 
the group comes from all walks of life ron harrison works with 
the mentally retarded szynal is a graduate of newbury college in 
brookline who is interested in fashion design jolley works for the 
legislature charlie mokotoff teaches at northeastern university in 
boston dennison is an actress 
hearing people are welcome and if someone knows how to sign 
they can ususally join any of the highly visible conversations 
its special here because the deaf and the hearing and the 
hearing impaired all have a chance to mix harrison said 
the jukebox occasionally kicks on when a hearing person drops in 
a quarter around the room the conversation goes on uninterrupted 
some hearing people who unwittingly stumble upon the group 
however find it hard to understand deaf culture said joe 
cardillo who is deaf 
some take offense for example when the deaf pound a table or 
stamp on the floor sending out vibrations to get the attention of 
another deaf person 
hearing can call you and get your attention hearing thinks 
the pounding is a stupid thing to do cardillo said its my 
way i have to do it that way to get peoples attention 
many hearing people learning to sign at nearby universities stop 
by to find patient conversation partners and maybe even learn a 
few deaf jokes 
you learn better here talking to deaf people because its more 
natural said peter hawker of medford who learned to sign to 
communicate with his deaf brother after they see youre someone 
learning to sign these guys will turn around shake your hand and 
invite you in 
sign languages special syntax gives the deaf their own brand of 
humor and a repertoire of jokes not easily related to the hearing 
world 
but the deaf have an advantage in a pastime as old as barrooms 
eavesdropping 
sure mokotoff said jumping up on a chair and looking 
across the room want to know what theyre saying at that table 
over there

on drug traffickers who have repeatedly bombed the nations cities 
in an effort to stop the government from extraditing suspected 
traffickers to the united states 
the explosion occurred less than 24 hours after the government 
said a bomb placed aboard a colombian airliner had caused it to 
crash shortly after takeoff from bogota last month killing all 107

whether they face any criminal charges in colombia 
the building is near a plaza that is normally filled with fruit 
and candy vendors in the morning and scores of people walking to 
work 
the goverment of president virgilio barco declared war on the

a proposal to sell the albany county airport 
to private bidders has been set back by the federal aviation 
administration but proponents insist the deal is not dead 
the negotiations to sell or lease the airport were viewed as the 
possible beginning of a trend toward privatization of the nations 
municipal airports 
james j coyne the democratic county executive who initiated 
the proposal to sell the airport said today that he felt misled by 
the reagan and bush administrations after being told of the faas 
disapproval 
heres an administration that has been very much a proponent 
at least verbally concerning privatization coyne said 
i feel we were misled by that administration 
albanys airport and others run by cities and local governments 
are increasingly beset with crowding and flight delays because 
terminal expansion has failed to keep up with the growth in airline 
travel the last big airport to open was dallasfort worths 15 
years ago 
backers of private ownership say the profit motive would force 
corporate operators to do a better job running airports than 
governments do opponents contend private owners would raise the 
fees they charge airlines thus driving up ticket prices 
the proposal is not dead coyne said he will work with 
executives of british american development corp of latham ny 
and lockheed air terminal inc of burbank calif as well as the 
local bus authority to explore ways to privatize the airport 
without running into trouble with the faa 
i still feel the private sector is the best way to go said 
coyne 
faa officials ruled earlier this week that airport revenue had 
to be put back into the airport rather than used for profits or to 
repay debt raised to buy the airport 
british american executives said the ruling was a setback but 
not a death blow to their bid 
i think it has tremendous impact not only on the albany county 
airport but to every airport around the country said peter 
cornell president of british american 
if that stands up it is sending a signal all around the 
country that we are not working toward privatization but toward 
nationalization of airports cornell said local governments 
will just step away from running these airports and the federal 
government will have to step in i dont think that was the 
intent 
one solution cornell said would be to break the airport up 
into segments using revenues from operations not regulated by the 
faa such as parking and car rentals for profit and debt service 
while operating the airline segments separately under faa 
regulations 
british american and lockheed had combined to offer to buy the 
airport for 30 million and run it for a profit county officials 
hoped to use the money to avoid raising taxes while financing 
county operations

for the opposition the 18day 
popular revolt that has brought their compatriots a heady dose of 
freedom has been a harrowing round of endless meetings to make sure 
the uprising stays on course 
vaclav havel the oppositions bestknown leader looked 
exhausted wednesday when he announced that a new government would 
be formed with opposition approval later this week 
bustling around the oppositions new headquarters in a central 
prague gallery grabbing sandwiches and coffee the activists are 
growing more weary with each day that brings them a real say in 
czechoslovakias politics 
dissidents who once spent hours talking to reporters in their 
apartments bustled in and out of a tactical session pausing only 
to smile and refusing to answer questions 
stanislaw milota a film director banned from his profession for 
years organized the oppositions own cameras to transmit havels 
news conference 
it will be good when this war is over he sighed the rings 
under his eyes dark from lack of sleep 
we are tired people here said a weary john bok almost 
frantic in his appeal for calm we have been sleeping only one 
and a half hours so be patient please 
in the 18 astounding days that have propelled the charter 77 
dissidents who make up the core of civic forum from isolation to 
daily negotiations with the communists tactics have changed almost 
hourly 
at its founding meeting nov 19 civic forum simply demanded the 
ouster of five hardline communists associated with the crackdown 
after 1968 two men linked to nov 17 police brutality and an 
investigation into that crackdown threatening a general strike if 
those demands were not met 
when more than 100000 people turned out in prague to support 
them the next day the opposition found itself suddenly wielding 
surprising force 
on nov 21 there was a first meeting with communist premier 
ladislav adamec at two marathon sessions nov 24 and nov 26 the 
communist party ousted the leaders who had pursued hardline 
policies for 21 years 
on nov 28 the day after the hugely successful general strike 
adamec relinquished the communists 41year hold on power voted 
out of the constitution the next day in parliament 
all the time the opposition was changing tactics formulating 
new demands intended to ensure that this time czechoslovakia gets 
real democracy and not the communistled reforms crushed by a 
warsaw pact invasion in 1968 
within days of civic forums formation havel and other 
dissidents who spent years in jail and isolation from society had 
assembled a team of economists lawyers and other advisers many of 
them experts who spent years in the wilderness after the crackdown 
on the 1968 prague spring 
changing roles swiftly from dissident playwright to political 
negotiator havel has closeted himself with these advisers to 
hammer out tactics 
as the protest spread to workers more representatives from the 
factories were admitted to these sessions and addressed opposition 
rallies 
the composition of delegations visiting adamec and other 
officials also has changed to reflect new strands in the movement 
bringing in slovak representatives students young people and 
artists 
its really funny said an opposition activist who did not 
want to be identified everybody wants to meet with us now to 
prove how democratic they are and how they always favored reform 
the higher the stakes the more the opposition has taken on the 
attributes of any political organization dealing with a public avid 
for news leaks are constantly sought and rarely given leading 
figures who spoke publicly on any point days ago have clammed up 
please understand that we cannot answer any of the questions 
you want to ask us said spokesman jiri dienstbier after havel 
announced a new government would be formed this week these are 
crazy times really crazy 
another problem some activists face is that they still have jobs 
amid their opposition activity 
dienstbier and fellow dissident petr uhl for instance swap 
shifts as stokers at the same factory their fellow workers cant 
make up for them all the time 
last week i had the wives of coworkers sending me notes as 
we held our meetings offering to work extra dienstbier said 
with a chuckle 
the success of what is halfjokingly known as the velvet 
revolution for its smoothness depends on the ability of the 
opposition to keep the ball rolling 
on tuesday constitutional lawyers who had a blueprint for a 
new democratic constitution ready for months presented it on 
behalf of civic forum to parliament 
by wednesday the opposition had new demands to remove the 
federal and czech regional public prosecutors 
keeping the pressure up in this way involves the help of legions 
of young people working as guards and secretaries and running 
errands 
they bustle around the new opposition headquarters hurriedly 
relocated tuesday to a downtown club from the nearby laterna magika 
theater 
there is almost no time to keep up with events absorbing 
everyday life economist vaclav klaus a leading adviser to civic 
forum pounced on a pile of newspapers lying around the offices 
wednesday 
i havent seen the newspapers for days he said smiling as 
he plunged into another closeddoor meeting

american workers made modest productivity 
gains in the third quarter but the lackluster manufacturing sector 
posted its lowest output gain in three years and continued to slow 
the overall economy the government said wednesday 
and for the first time this year the quartertoquarter hourly 
wage gains made by workers outpaced the the growth in consumer 
inflation the labor department said 
the department said overall productivity in the nonfarm sector 
of the economy increased at a revised annual rate of 25 percent in 
the julyseptember period more than double the anemic 11 percent 
annualrate gain in the second quarter 
but in manufacturing a sector weakened by slumping auto sales 
and other problems productivity increased at a revised annual rate 
of just 1 percent after improving at an annual rate of 37 percent 
in the apriljune period 
the poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 12 
percent and hours worked increased a weak 02 percent reflecting 
slackened demand for goods the increase in output was the smallest 
since a slight decline in the second quarter of 1986 
because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a 
significant increase in wages unit labor costs a key determinant 
of future price inflation rose at at an annual rate of 49 percent 
after decreasing by 1 percent in the second quarter it was the 
largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982 recession the 
department said 
that increase will likely translate into either higher prices 
for consumers for manufactured goods or lower profits for producers 
or both and also makes it more difficult for us manufacturers 
to compete in overseas markets 
were getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing and 
with the weak productivity numbers that pushes up costs the 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm 
kathleen stephansen senior economist for donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette echoed the sentiments of most analysts in saying it was 
unlikely the manufacturing sector would rebound until interest 
rates drop further which she said could come soon if november 
employment data due friday showed continued economic weakness 
the overall 25 percent annualrate productivity gain in the 
nonfarm sector came as output rose at a rate of 37 percent in the 
julyseptember period while hours worked grew at a much slower 
annual rate of 13 percent 
for the overall nonfarm sector the data on unit labor costs 
was more encouraging costs per good produced rose at a revised 
annual rate of 28 percent in the third quarter after rising at a 
rapid 45 percent rate in the apriljune period 
the government said hourly compensation in the nonfarm sector 
grew at an annual rate of 53 percent in the julyseptember period 
an increase that translated into a real earnings gain of 28 
percent an hour when inflation is taken into account 
the hourly compensation for manufacturing workers increased at 
an annual rate of 59 percent after inflation is factored into 
that improvement manufacturing workers received a real hourly 
earnings boost of 35 percent at an annual rate in the third 
quarter 
for both the overall economy and the manufacturing sector it was 
the first time this year that workers enjoyed an increase in real 
hourly earnings wage gains minus the erosion of buying power 
caused by inflation

attorney general dick thornburgh overruled 
staff prosecutors in ordering a preliminary inquiry into 
allegations of political favoritism and perjury by former housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr thornburghs spokesman said 
wednesday 
thornburgh reversed the recommendation from the justice 
departments public integrity section that there was an 
insufficient basis to conduct a preliminary inquiry of the 
allegations against pierce said spokesman david runkel 
the 60day inquiry thornburgh ordered will determine whether he 
should seek court appointment of an independent counsel to conduct 
a full criminal investigation of the former housing secretary 
runkel dismissed suggestions that thornburgh had ordered the 
preliminary inquiry to deflect charges from democrats in congress 
that he was scuttling an investigation of a fellow republican and 
former cabinet colleague in the reagan administration 
he was concerned that the issues reviewed needed further 
investigation runkel said he wasnt convinced by the public 
integrity sections point of view 
the allegations that pierce awarded department of housing and 
urban development grants on the basis of political favoritism and 
lied under oath during congressional hearings last spring were made 
last month by 19 house democrats 
the lawmakers cited testimony that pierce gave to the house 
government operations employment and housing subcommittee that he 
had not had hands on involvement in the award of hud grants to 
politically connected developers 
the independent counsel process was triggered when the 19 
democrats members of the house judiciary committee forwarded 
their allegations to thornburgh on nov 2 
in accordance with that procedure thornburgh disclosed monday 
his decision to conduct the preliminary inquiry 
pierce has denied any wrongdoing but has twice refused to give 
additional testimony to the house subcommittee citing his 
constitutional right against selfincrimination 
pierces lawyers have contended that the lawmakers did not 
provide the justice department with any specific and credible 
evidence that their client had committed a crime 
the public integrity section applying that standard as outlined 
in the independent counsel law apparently agreed with that view 
earlier this week pierces lawyers expressed confidence that 
the preliminary inquiry would not result in the appointment of an 
independent counsel

under irresistible pressure from the 
rankandfile to cleanse itself east germanys communist party is 
moving at top speed against the previously ironclad taboos of the 
stalin era 
the latest indication came wednesday when the official party 
newspaper urged a full investigation into the deaths of thousands 
of german communists killed in josef stalins purges in the 1930s 
and 1940s 
on tuesday night east berlin saw its firstever concert and the 
opening of an exhibition commemorating victims of the soviet 
dictators repression 
an emergency party congress friday is expected to recast the 
communists internal structure with the aim of building a 
democratically run party 
such a move would respond to calls in several east german 
newspapers wednesday for abolition of stalinist structures in 
the party including such instruments of uncompromising rule from 
the top as the central committee and politburo 
why do we need a politburo if we want to turn the sed east 
german communist party into a democratic party asked the 
official party newspaper neues deutschland 
new party structures must prevent corruption abuse of 
official position or arrogance of power berliner zeitung 
newspaper said 
before the special classical concert in east berlins opera 
author christoph hein told the audience today a swamp of 
incredible dimensions is emerging it will stop instilling fear 
when it is reclaimed 
introducing beethovens ninth symphony one speaker read a list 
of victims of stalinist repression in east germany and paid tribute 
to those killed during purges in the soviet union 
neues deutschland commenting on the death of thousands of 
german communists in siberian labor camps between the world wars 
said we have been silent too long about the fate of most of 
them and it asked how the official blind eye toward this sorry 
chapter could be justified 
east german party officials have already demanded access to 
soviet files allegedly listing the victims 
heinz vosske head of the partys central archives suggested 
that a plaque commemorating communists killed in stalins time be 
put up in east berlin 
several leading intellectuals have been officially 
rehabilitated including the philosopher ernst bloch and physicist 
robert havemann a longtime dissident 
the party was also considering the rehabilitation of two 
journalists sacked for dissent in 1953 including a former chief 
editor of neues deutschland 
new culture minister dietmar keller a communist recently said 
the country is open for a range of opinions and the party will no 
longer censor artists 
at his first news conference he appealed to exiled east german 
cultural figures to resume ties with their native country despite 
the long shadows of history 
officials have already announced that films banned in the 1960s 
for questioning stalinist policies will be be shown some of them 
for the first time

iran said wednesday that 900 suspected 
drug smugglers face the gallows in a yearold narcotics crackdown 
in which more than 1000 men and women already have been executed 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in cyprus 
quoted a senior official as saying that 14000 people including 
569 afghans had been arrested since march for major drug offenses 
nine hundred of these are liable for the death penalty said 
kiyumars abu directorgeneral of the islamic revolutionary 
committees antinarcotics division 
irans antidrug campaign could eventually dam up what has 
become a major narcotics pipeline into western europe and the 
united states 
human rights organizations have condemned the large number of 
executions in the ruthless crackdown begun a year ago 
but a campaign that cuts the volume of heroin flooding into the 
west could help president hashemi rafsanjanis efforts to end 
irans isolation and restore relations with the west 
it also would coincide with the us war on drugs and possibly 
help foster a dialogue betwen tehran and washington which severed 
relations with iran in 1979 
an antinarcotics law passed jan 21 stipulates the death 
penalty for anyone found with even small amounts of heroin or 
opium the base for heroin 
iranian authorities have hanged in a single day as many as 80 
people convicted of smuggling by irans nonjury islamic courts 
the bodies are often left dangling from makeshift gallows or 
overhead road bridges for the day as a warning 
the news agency quoted abu as saying authorities had broken up 
more than 140 smuggling gangs since march and seized more than 21 
tons of narcotics scores of the heavily armed smugglers have been 
killed in battles with security forces it said 
more than 41000 addicts have been arrested and sent to labor 
camps for rehabilitation abu said adding that 10000 had remained 
off drugs 
officials have estimated iran has 1 million addicts but the 
total is believed to be double that because addiction has soared 
since the 1979 islamic revolution and during the eightyear 
iraniraq war 
the iranians are trying to coordinate their crackdown with 
neighoring pakistan and afghanistan where much of the heroin 
opium and hashish originates and with turkey 
interior minister abdullah nouri signed an accord with pakistan 
last month to work together on antinarcotics operations along the 
border 
earlier this year prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan 
declared war on the countrys 40 drug mafias 
but drug barons in pakistan are deeply entrenched and western 
drug enforcement officials say the lucrative smuggling operations 
involve military and government officials 
stopping smuggling from neighboring afghanistan to the northeast 
is even more of a problem because of the civil war in that nation 
moslem guerrillas fighting afghanistans sovietbacked government 
reportedly help bankroll their campaign by smuggling opium 
iran afghanistan and pakistan have largely replaced southeast 
asia as the key producer of heroin following a us crackdown in 
the east in the past decade 
a recent us state department report on narcotics said that 
opium production and heroin trafficking are deeply entrenched 
in iran afghanistan and pakistan 
it said that between 200 and 400 tons of opium were produced in 
iran in 1987 800 tons in afghanistan and more than 200 tons in 
pakistan 
the opium often is refined into heroin in secret laboratories in 
iran and smuggled into turkey by truck 
other shipments are carried by mule trains through the mountains 
of kurdistan which occupies southeastern turkey northwestern iran 
and northern iraq kurdish guerrillas are said to help and use 
their profits to buy weapons for their separatist campaigns against 
iran iraq and turkey 
nouri has assigned tens of thousands of security forces backed 
by helicopter gunships to hunt down the drug smugglers 
the smugglers are armed with machine guns rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers and antiaircraft weapons and there have been 
scores of pitched battles along the rugged eastern borders over the 
last year

while the supreme court weighs its first 
righttodie decision the veterans affairs department is 
drafting guidelines for dealing with those issues in its 276 
medical centers and nursing homes 
the va currently follows the state laws such as the missouri law 
at the center of the case being reviewed by the high court but the 
department has determined that a statebystate approach is 
unworkable when both patients and doctors may transfer from 
facility to facility nationwide 
the issue has become especially critical to the va because it 
operates the nations largest medical system and because of the age 
of its clientele nearly half the 27 million veterans in this 
country are older than 54 
unlike 32yearold nancy cruzan who other than her brain injury 
was a healthy individual va patients often are old terminally or 
critically ill 
va actually began addressing such issues before 1983 when it 
implemented a donotresuscitate policy on certain terminally 
ill patients 
dr dorthy rasinski the va physician and attorney in charge of 
the ethics committee drafting the latest proposed guidelines says 
there is no conflict between the federal government arguing to 
uphold the missouri law while the va is adopting nationwide 
regulations 
but there do appear to be some superficial inconsistencies 
she acknowledged in an interview from her office at the long beach 
calif va medical center where she is assistant chief of staff 
for education 
on determining what a comatose patient would have wanted the va 
is leaning toward putting the next of kin next in line along with 
the physicians in making the decisions whether to withdraw 
lifesustaining equipment she said 
in the cruzan case ms cruzans parents argued she had told 
them that she would not want artificial means if ever rendered 
incompetent the missouri supreme court said such statements fall 
well short of the clear and convincing evidence needed to prove 
her real intent 
rasinski said that the va guidelines would not be so strict as 
to require a clear and convincing proof which she interprets 
as largely relying on written evidence 
we would want something more than the unilateral recollection 
of a single conversation she said nurses physicians families 
and friends would provide such evidence she said 
the va realizes there are situations where the family member is 
not in the best position to make the decision she said and there 
are times when the physician has rejected a family members 
recommendation that lifesupport be withdrawn 
she noted that in many cases a patients wishes may be better 
understood by someone else such as in the case of aids patients 
who have been alienated from their families because of 
homosexuality also she said family members may be motivated by 
the desire to collect survivors benefits 
but rasinski says the centerpiece of the va policy will be the 
execution of a livingwill document known as a durable power of 
attorney in which patients specify their representatives and 
their wishes beforehand 
at the long beach hospital incoming patients are informed of 
the california state law that provides for such living wills 
the american legion a major veterans service organization has 
not addressed the issue

a roman catholic assemblywomans opponent today conceded she 
narrowly won a special california state senate election that 
attracted national attention after she was denied communion because 
of her abortionrights ads 
in north dakota voters rejected all eight proposals on their 
ballot 
with all 536 of the san diego county precincts reporting 
fourterm democratic assemblywoman lucy killea led her republican 
opponent freshman assemblywoman carol bentley by 1528 votes 
although 2500 to 3000 absentee ballots remained to be counted 
this afternoon bentley said at a news conference that she did not 
think they would make a difference 
without those ballots the totals were 60012 or 51 percent 
for killea to bentleys 58484 votes or 49 percent 
killea declined to say if bishop leo t mahers communion ban 
played a key role in the race 
theres no way of really judging that she said i dont 
know how you would figure it out other than get somebody to do some 
polling and im not going to do that 
bentley said the communion ban and abortion issue were decisive 
in the heavily republican district 
what this says is that my opponents whole strategy was to 
focus this race on abortion so people wouldnt be looking at her 
liberal voting record in the state legislature she said the 
bishop had an incredible impact on this race in one letter he 
created an instant international celebrity and a martyr 
kate michelman executive director in washington dc of the 
national abortion rights action league called killeas win a 
stunning victory 
the bishop shot himself in the foot said michelman who was 
rasied as a catholic this is not the role for religion they 
should not be getting involved in politics the voters there 
really rose up against what the bishop was trying to do 
in northern california a fouryear legal battle to boost 
hispanic representation on watsonsville city council ended with 
hispanics losing three of four seats they had sought the election 
was the first under a districtvote system council candidates 
previously were elected at large 
in deciding the most questions on a north dakota ballot since 
1919 voters soundly defeated proposals to raise the gasoline tax 
income tax and sales tax 
with all precincts reporting the closest margin was on the 
proposal to raise the 5 percent sales tax by 1 percent it lost 53 
percent to 47 percent 
gov george sinner pondered budget cuts and a special 
legislative session today after the proposed tax increases were 
defeated 
ive done my best to explain what we thought was at stake 
said the democratic governor who had campaigned for the tax 
increases now i have to do the best i can to make it work 
tax opponents led by bismarck businessman kent french 
celebrated 
its people power the people of north dakota have spoken 
tonight he said 
more than 60 percent of voters also defeated a mandatory seat 
belt law a measure to legalize video gambling machines and a 
proposed health and sex education curriculum in public schools the 
seventh measure a proposal to allow north dakota legislators to 
join the state public employees retirement system lost by 88 
percent the unofficial totals showed 
and a constitutional amendment calling for reorganization of the 
executive branch of state government lost by 7129 percent 
more than 230000 north dakotans 48 percent of eligible voters 
thronged to the polls robert valeu deputy secretary of state 
said the turnout topped the record of 212000 in a special ballot 
in july 1939 that rejected a tax increase and liquor sales in 
stores 
in san diego countys state senate race killea is the first 
us public official to be denied communion by the roman catholic 
church because of her support for abortion rights 
killea has said she will not change her stance on abortion 
the special election was held to replace the incumbent who was 
made a municipal judge 
watsonvilles election was originally scheduled for nov 7 but 
was postponed after the oct 17 earthquake which demolished more 
than 300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of san 
francisco 
housing and development which were big issues before the quake 
took on even greater importance afterward

novelist regine deforges plagiarized the classic 
gone with the wind for her bestseller the blue bicycle a 
court ruled wednesday ordering her and her publisher to pay 
margaret mitchells heirs 333000 in damages and interest 
the american trust co bank which holds the world rights to 
gone with the wind had sought 833000 from ms deforges and 
her publisher editions ramsay 
ramsay president franck spengler said the company and ms 
deforges would appeal the novelist was in west germany and 
unavailable for comment he said 
we feel were innocent spengler said in an interview 
the books are both great novels but they are very different 
and so are their heroines by nature lea is an optimist and 
scarlett is more anglosaxon harddriving determined and 
powerhungry 
lets put it this way the blue bicycle is a historical 
novel smattered with psychology and emotion while gone with the 
wind is a pyschological novel cloaked with history he said 
in a judgment issued by judge nicole antoine the court 
concluded the blue bicycle constituted an illicit 
reproduction of gone with the wind 
based on a comparative study of the two works it is clear 
that what regine deforges borrowed from margaret mitchells work 
and incorporated into the blue bicycle is perfectly identifiable 
and relates to the most important elements of ms mitchells 
novel the statement said 
the court said ms deforges copied the general intrigue plot 
development and narrative progression the physical and 
psychological characteristics of the major figures the 
relationships between the characters several secondary characters 
a large number of characteristic situations the composition and 
expression of numerous scenes and key dramatic moments of gone 
with the wind 
there are similarities the blue bicycle which has sold 
millions of copies since it was published in 1983 as the first part 
of a trilogy is set during the nazi occupation of france 
its heroine lea delmas is the beautiful headstrong daughter 
of a southern vintner like scarlett ohara her carefree youth is 
interrupted by the horrors of war 
the opening scenes of garden parties pretty dresses and 
breathless suitors are reminiscent of the american south and 
france like the united states in the civil war is divided 
provichy petainists condemn charles de gaulles freedom fighters 
collaborators and militia men hunt down jews and resistance 
lea sides with the underground roaming the bordelais 
countryside on her blue bicycle carrying secret messages 
like scarlett lea wants the one man she cannot have laurent 
dargilat has married the sweet fragile and morally upright 
camille who bears an uncanny resemblance to melanie 
deforges frenchstyle rhett butler francois tavernier is a 
swarthy cigarsmoking rogue who miraculously turns up whenever lea 
needs him 
the case has been long and complicated because there are few 
precedents french law forbids plagiarism but it does allow 
pastiche a centuriesold literary form defined as a humorous 
takeoff or remake of a recognizable original text 
ms mitchells heirs saw nothing funny about the blue 
bicycle despite ms deforges repeated assertions that her novel 
was meant as a pastiche 
i know what plagiarism is and its a very bad thing ms 
degorges said when the case went to court two years ago from the 
beginning the blue bicycle was intended to be a pastiche i never 
said it was supposed to be anything else 
the court rejected her argument saying the differences between 
the two works were undeniably secondary and inoperative given the 
extent of their similarities

the national transportation safety board today 
blamed the crew of a montana rail link freight train for failing to 
secure the brakes before a crash and chemical explosion that forced 
evacuation of 2000 people in subfreezing helena last winter 
the board also cited as contributing to the accident the 
decision of an engineer to rearrange the trains locomotives while 
leaving the cars unattended on a mountain grade the effects of the 
cold that reached a windchill factor of minus70 degrees at the 
time of the feb 2 crash and inadequate training by the railroad 
management 
the board voting 40 issued several recommendations to the 
railroad to burlington northern railroad which owned the tracks 
the federal railraod administration the association of american 
railroads and the city of helena 
the independent safety board determines probable cause of 
accidents and makes recommendations for improving safety but has no 
statutory or police authority 
cars from the train which had been making its way up a long 
mountain grade en route to spokane wash coasted backwards nine 
miles into helena and hit another train and a propane tank flames 
from the propane explosion ignited one of the derailed cars which 
contained highly flammable chemical 
the ntsb noted that the release of hazardous materials 
contributed to the severity of the 448 am crash in which no one 
was killed or seriously injured damage was estimated at 6 
million not including several private homes that suffered broken 
windows and other damage 
board investigators said the crew of the train failed to 
properly secure train brakes after disconnecting cars so they could 
rearrange engines that were helping the train up the long grade 
toward the continental divide 
the decision to move the engines was made after the heater and 
then the engine failed in the lead locomotive

egypt has agreed to secretary of state james 
a bakers proposals for a direct dialogue between israel and 
palestinian representatives provided certain conditions are met 
the state department said today 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called the egyptian 
reply a step forward for the peace process she raised the 
possibility of a meeting among the israeli and egyptian foreign 
ministers and the us secretary of state early next year to work 
on additional steps 
however it appeared there were still roadblocks to the start of 
any direct talks among all the parties 
egypt has been working as the intermediary between the plo and 
baker in the effort to get a dialogue under way its response 
follows weeks of contacts between egyptian and us officials 
ms tutwiler indicated that egypt as israel had done earlier 
set forth certain conditions that must be met if it is to continue 
participating in the peace process 
one such condition based on statements over the weekend by 
palestine liberation organization representatives is that the plo 
participate in selecting the palestinian delegation for the 
dialogue with israel 
earlier israel had accepted the baker plan on the condition 
that no plo representative take part israel also is demanding that 
the talks be limited to prime minister yithak shamirs plan for 
elections in the occupied territories the plo favors a dialogue 
only if it deals with broader issues 
in israel an adviser to foreign minister moshe arens said 
israel was waiting to see the egyptian response in writing ms 
tutwiler said baker telephoned arens this morning to brief him on 
the response 
we have now received from the government of egypt a positive 
response to secretary bakers fivepoint framework ms tutwiler 
said 
we will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to 
a trilateral meeting in washington as part of a process for 
launching an israelipalestinian dialogue she said 
the key element in a fivepoint baker plan accepts israels view 
that israeli representatives will take part in the dialogue on the 
basis of shamirs election proposal 
under that proposal the palestinians would elect 
representatives to open negotiations with israel on limited 
selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip 
the baker plan also makes a concession to the palestinian side 
in stating that palestinian representatives at the talks would be 
free to raise issues that relate to their opinions on how to make 
the elections and the negotiating process succeed 
this raises the possibility although not explicitly of a more 
open agenda in the talks than that favored by the israelis who 
want to avoid discussion of points which are of high priority to 
the plo such as the establishment of a palestinian state

an american explorer said wednesday he has 
found ancient stone tablets in perus highland jungle that may 
prove the area was the site of king solomons legendary gold mines 
we have found something that is going to revolutionize the 
archaeological interpretation of perus ancient civilizations 
said gene savoy an explorer and historian 
savoy 62 is a member of the new york explorers club and is 
credited with discovering 40 lost cities in perus remote tropical 
rain forests in three decades of work 
he said in an interview the tablets contain the first writing 
found from the ancient civilizations of the andes and that the 
inscriptions are similar to phoenician and semitic hieroglyphs 
perus precolombian cultures which culminated with the incas 
were not known to have written languages 
savoy said he found three tablets each weighing several tons 
and measuring about 5 by 10 feet in august in a cave near gran 
vilaya the immense ruins of the chachapoyas indian civilization 
that he discovered in 1985 
the gran vilaya ruins are 400 miles north of lima and 9000 feet 
above sea level in a fogshrouded region of the andes that 
peruvians call the jungles eyebrow 
savoy displayed photos of the tablets which he said remain in 
the cave and sketches of rubbings taken from the stones he 
pointed out the similarities between the stylized inscriptions and 
samples of phoenician hieroglyphs 
the hieroglyphs on the tablets are similar to those used in king 
solomons time and include one identical to the symbol that always 
appeared on the ships he sent to the legendary land of ophir which 
the bible described as the source of his gold savoy said 
when i first heard about the possible contact between egypt 
and israel and the americas nobody was more skeptical than i 
was he said i thought it was absolutely ridiculous theyve 
been talking about this crazy stuff for years 
but now weve got stone tablets and this cannot be denied 
savoy who has written books on his explorations in peru said 
he has studied his findings since early september and is preparing 
to publish them 
the tablets were not brought here from another country like 
egypt this is a chachapoyas form of hieroglyphic writing he 
said referring to the indian empire that once dominated the jungle 
region 
were talking about something very old its possible the 
andean cultures are much older than we realize perhaps older 
than what we know as the old world savoy said 
savoy said he has found ancient stone roads leading down from 
the misty heights of gran vilaya to the river tributaries that feed 
into the amazon 
he said the chachapoyas could have used the amazon as a 
highway to the sea and there is no reason the egyptians or hebrews 
couldnt have used the amazon in reverse 
this is controversial of course he said but its all 
there for the doubters to see 
savoy was decorated by the peruvian senate last week for his 
contributions to peru he lived from 1957 to 1970 in peru and now 
resides in reno nev where he directs the andean explorers 
foundation 
in 1964 in what has been regarded as his most important 
discovery he located vilcabamba the last inca city 
he discovered gran vilaya in 1985 which he says was the capital 
of the chachapoyas culture the civilization reached its zenith 
between 800 and 1000 ad and later was conquered by the incas

vice president dan quayle has a strange 
attitude toward the soviet union and appeared to be standing still 
in a fastmoving world a foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday 
gennady i gerasimov reacting to a quayle interview in the 
washington post on tuesday said the vice president resisted 
adapting to the changes taking place in the soviet union 
in the interview quayle said youre still dealing with a 
totalitarian government that wants to create instability in 
other nations i dont think theyve changed much in foreign 
policy quayle was quoted as saying 
gerasimov said the malta summit meeting between president bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had improved relations to 
a qualitatively new level 
quayle gerasimov said considers it to be a mistake to treat 
the meeting as a sign of change in soviet foreign policy 
gerasimov said that despite the rapid changes taking place in 
eastern europe and the soviet union quayle remains devoted to 
his own beliefs 
a politician if he is a realistically minded one has to 
assess changes in the world to react to the new challenges of the 
time gerasimov said 
the remarks by the vice president compared to other speeches 
by the american president the american secretary of state the 
presidents assistant on national security and others sounded 
strange gerasimov said 
he compared quayle to kozma prutkov a character in russian 
literature who was stubbornly resistant to change like kozma 
prutkov this noble knight is in the same position sitting on a 
stone while the world is changing

president bush on wednesday announced the 
formation of a task force designed to find ways to overcome what he 
called a crisis in hispanic education 
bush told education secretary lauro f cavazos the panel should 
try to come up with recommendations to reduce a historically high 
hispanic school dropout rate promote adult literacy and send more 
hispanics to college 
in a memo to cavazos released by the white house bush said 
hispanic americans are especially undereducated 
as hispanics become the largest minority group in the united 
states early in the next century it becomes more and more 
important to overcome the crisis in hispanic education he said 
bush said that between 9 percent and 11 percent of hispanic 
students drop out of high school each year the highest dropout 
rate of any major ethnic or racial group among hispanics over age 
25 an alarming 52 percent have not completed high school 
compared to 21 percent of nonhispancis bush said

house republican leader bob michel said 
wednesday that television reporting on congress takes second 
place to reporting on the president and few newspapers provide 
detailed reporting of house and senate proceedings 
michel spoke at a national press club luncheon during a 
symposium on the press and a divided government sponsored by 
the gerald r ford library and the national press foundation 
former president ford also discussed the subject of press 
coverage of a government in which republicans control the white 
house and democrats dominate in congress 
i dont think its hard ford said all you have to do is 
be fair 
michel said to oversimplify the issue for the sake of debate 
lets say television with its emphasis on the personal has become 
the major presidential news medium and print with its ability to 
describe complex issues has become the major congressional medium 
for tv evening news with its mass audience television 
reporting on congress takes second place to reporting on the 
president he said 
the only time network television gives the congress a detailed 
look is when scandal erupts or if some committee is holding 
hearings on some currently hot topic michel said the rest of 
the time we could just as well be on the moon so far as the mass 
audience is concerned 
the illinois republican told his audience print journalism 
offers a bit more opportunity to go into detail but how many 
american newspapers give congress indepth coverage not many 
aggressive press coverage of strongly held clashing values in 
a divided government would be good for america michel said 
but we dont have that kind of coverage the press in general 
does a good job reporting on the foibles and the gaffes and the 
slips of a president but it doesnt provide a mass audience with 
the underlying realities of democratic control of the house 
michel said that recently he and rep mickey edwards rokla 
held a news conference on the issue of house reform and added 
after we spoke the first question and most of the rest 
concerned a thenprominent house scandal only one major newspaper 
reported our proposals for reform 
im not saying scandals shouldnt be covered michel said 
all im saying is that the dull workaday routine of the house 
that affects 200 million americans deserves equal time 
so today i offer the networks and the majority of our nations 
newspapers a challenge prove that im wrong

the leading spokesman for palestinians was 
barred wednesday from entering the west bank and gaza strip and 
israeli defense minister yitzhak rabin said the arab uprising might 
last another two years 
troops opened fire in the west bank town of nablus to disperse 
demonstrators wounding eight palestinians hospital officials 
said six arabs were shot by troops in stonethrowing clashes in 
gaza they said 
the army imposed a curfew that will confine gazas 750000 
residents to their homes beginning thursday to head off possible 
protests friday when the uprising enters its third year a similar 
curfew was expected for the west bank 
soldiers also demolished three houses of palestinians suspected 
in attacks on israeli soldiers and civilians 
palestinian spokesman faisal husseini who lives in the arab 
sector of jerusalem annexed by israel was banned by the army from 
entering the occupied territories for six months he accused 
authorities of trying to increase tension among palestinians in the 
occupied territories 
the army orders said the travel ban against husseini 49 was 
taken for the sake of ensuring public peace the defense of the 
area and the establishment of public order

against the authorities against the army the official who 
insisted on anonymity gave no details 
husseini a proplo activist was released from prison in 
january after being held for 18 months without charge or trial but 
he has since been invited to several meetings by israeli officials 
seeking his views on peace prospects 
husseini said in an interview that the army action was not 
warranted 
he noted that his trips to the occupied territories have largely 
dealt with settling disputes among various palestinian factions 
apparently the occupiers are looking for more fights among the 
people possibly to justify their staying there husseini said 
in jerusalem rabin told a parliament debate on the uprising 
that while the army has not succeeded in quelling the revolt he 
believed israel eventually would convince palestinian activists 
they can gain nothing by violence 
i am convinced that we mustnt under any circumstances give in 
to violence and must use every path to show those that deal in 
violence they will pay a heavy and painful price he said 
however rabin also said in remarks to soldiers that were 
broadcast on israel radio that the rebellion may last another 
year or two 
at least 626 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers 
or civilians in the rebellion 155 palestinians have been slain by 
fellow arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israel and 
43 israelis have died 
in nablus six protest marches involving hundreds of people 
erupted during a twohour relaxation by the army of a curfew that 
has been imposed since friday palestinian reporters said 
the protesters waved outlawed palestinian flags and chanted they 
would avenge the deaths of four members of a gang called the black 
panthers who were killed by soldiers on friday arab witnesses said 
eight people were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers in 
the citys old market or casbah and the nearby balata refugee 
camp hospital officials said one victim was a 14yearold boy 
shot in the back the officials said 
the army confirmed two injuries 
six palestinians were shot and wounded in stonethrowing clashes 
with israeli troops in the gaza strip hospitals reported 
also in gaza on wednesday several hundred israeli settlers 
staged demonstrations protesting the israeli decision to begin 
admitting 5800 palestinians from egypt the palestinians ended up 
on the egyptian side of the border when israel returned the sinai 
to egypt under the 1979 camp david peace accords 
datya hershkowitz a spokeswoman for the settlers accused 
israel of admitting people trained as terrorists during their 
years in egypt and described it as a birthday present for the 
uprising 
the first to be admitted were five men and several sons who 
will build houses and then bring the rest of their families

the abortion issue increasingly is being felt by catholic 
politicians straddling the divide between constituent and 
conscience as they struggle to mind their church and uphold their 
oaths of office 
when i made this decision i knew the church wasnt going to 
stand up and applaud said new york assemblyman herman farrell 
who first took a stand in favor of legalized abortions in 1974 
im surprised that it took them so long to bring some of this 
stuff up 
some of this stuff includes a california legislator being 
refused communion banishment from a rhode island church newspaper 
for politicians who wont take an antiabortion oath a statement 
from the bishops conference last month that for catholics there is 
no choice 
but the crackdown is a relief for many catholic lawmakers who 
resent colleagues who dissent from the churchs teaching on 
abortion 
if prominent catholic politicians in congress were to 
support the prolife cause it would certainly prevail said us 
rep henry hyde rill 
they should have done this a long time ago said state rep 
ed bybee of hawaii 
leaders of the 53 millionmember church last month declared no 
catholic can responsibly take a prochoice stand and said 
catholic legislators have a special moral responsibility to work 
for legislation limiting legalized abortion this came soon after 
the supreme court gave legislatures greater authority in regulating 
abortions 
in a special california state senate election tuesday lucy 
killea won a narrow victory despite being barred by san diego 
bishop leo t maher from receiving communion because of her 
prochoice campaign commercials 
her opponent freshman assemblywoman carol bentley conceded 
wednesday she had been defeated by 1528 votes although 2500 to 
3000 absentee ballots remained to be counted bentley said she 
didnt think they would make a difference 
its a stunning victory a real upset and its on the issue 
of abortion that she won said kate michelman executive director 
of the national abortion rights action league 
the bishop shot himself in the foot michelman said this 
is not the role for religion they should not be getting involved 
in politics 
montanas bishops have asked catholic politicians not to 
publicly contradict the church on abortion and two officials who 
spoke at an abortion rights rally have been called on the carpet 
and in providence ri the diocesan newspaper told politicians 
they had to sign a pledge supporting a constitutional amendment 
against abortion if they wanted to advertise holiday greetings 
my religion will not interfere with what i perceive to be my 
role in government said state sen vincent fumo of philadelphia 
i did not take the oath as an ambassador for the catholic 
church 
utah state rep frank pignaelli of salt lake city said the 
churchs position that no abortions are justifiable puts officials 
in a nowin situation 
what position does a catholic take if a bill comes up that 
prohibits abortion except if the mothers life is threatened and 
you vote for it you are perceived as taking a proabortion stance 
catholic legislators have one hell of a decision before them he 
said 
minnesota state sen gene waldorf expressed skepticism over the 
attacks on the bishops stand 
i never heard anything about separation of church and state 
when the bishops were talking about the poor and the hungry its 
only when they talk about abortion waldorf said 
still many politicans said the bishops strategy will backfire 
if they rely on sanctions 
i think they will be very effective in keeping catholic 
legislators away from the communion rail as political strategists 
they leave a great deal to be desired said idaho state sen mike 
blackbird 
ecclesiastical sanctions have been used sparingly by the church 
and with mixed results when sister mary agnes mansour took over as 
head of the michigan department of social services detroit 
cardinal edmund casimir szoka wanted her to resign or publicly 
oppose abortion she quit her religious order but new york 
assemblyman john dearie changed his vote on medicaid funding of 
abortions earlier this year after being told in 1986 that he would 
no longer be able to speak at parish events hed attended since he 
was a child while he supported public funding of abortions 
while the bishops are united in their belief the church has a 
role in the public policy debate over abortion they are divided on 
the value of sanctions 
for me taking into account constitutional tradition the best 
approach is one of persuasion one has to wonder if such 
penalties in the long run would not be counterproductive said 
bishop john darcy of ft wayne ind 
in san diego killeas opponent bentley said the bishops 
communion ban had an incredible impact on this race in one 
letter he created an instant international celebrity and a 
martyr

a nuclear power plant worker says he feels 
vindicated by a ruling that a utility discriminated against him by 
firing him after he voiced safety concerns about the project 
the labor department ordered arizona public service co to 
rehire william david simmons and give him back pay the utility 
operates and partly owns the palo verde nuclear generating station 
50 miles west of phoenix 
simmons 33 was fired oct 12 after being accused of cheating 
on a training test required by palo verde however the labor 
department said the utility couldnt substantiate the allegations 
simmons did not cheat on the exam and has been subjected to 
discrimination by the employer the department wrote in a nov 7 
letter to the utility and to simmons attorney stephen kohn 
kohn said simmons earned about 100000 a year as a 
radioactivewaste technician simmons hasnt been rehired and 
remains unemployed kohn told the associated press on wednesday 
simmons who had worked at palo verde since 1982 said the 
finding was a relief 
they attempted to destroy me and my lifestyle and now i feel 
vindicated he saidive never been known as a liar or a 
cheater this feels good i can tell you that 
don andrews a palo verde spokesman said wednesday he couldnt 
comment on the labor department ruling because it was a personnel 
matter and any actions of the case are still in progress 
andrews declined to say whether the ruling would be appealed 
however kohn said the utility had appealed it and a jan 9 
hearing on the matter has been scheduled before a department of 
labor judge in washington 
a federal nuclear regulatory commission spokesman said the 
agency was aware of the case and would ask aps for its account of 
the incident 
according to the labor department investigators report simmons 
was disliked by management for complaining to plant operators and 
regulators about his safety concerns 
complaints included potential problems with sodium hydroxide 
that reportedly was leaking into the surrounding water table and 
that employees werent qualified to use respirators 
simmons originally was faulted because he didnt attend required 
training classes but the labor department said plant managers 
never scheduled simmons to attend the classes 
eventually simmons was required to take the exams without 
attending the training classes investigator william whitfield 
reported during one of those exams palo verde officials said four 
instructors watched simmons look at small yellow notes 
however the utility was unable to prove that simmons had used 
the notes for a test considered to be so easy that no one could 
think of a reason for cheating whitfield wrote 
simmons acknowledged he brought study notes into the exam with 
him but said he didnt use them

the contras have no alternative but to 
stay together as a fighting force despite a regional peace accord 
requiring the nicaraguan rebels to disband this week the white 
house said wednesday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said nicaraguas 
leftist government has failed to live up to terms of the pact under 
which the contras were to be voluntarily repatriated 
under the agreement signed in august by the presidents of 
honduras costa rica nicaragua el salvador and guatemala the 
contras were to have disbanded by tuesday while the nicaraguan 
government was to make democratic reforms and promote safe 
conditions for them to return home 
the contras do not intend to demobilize because the conditions 
do not exist in nicaragua for them to return contra spokesman 
bosco matamoros said in a telephone interview on wednesday 
fitzwater said they will continue to receive nonlethal 
assistance from the united states under a bipartisan congressional 
agreement that granted them a total of 47 million to last until 
february when nicaragua is to hold national elections 
although the united states has cut off military aid the contras 
have continued skirmishing with government troops with the 
fighting going on even before nicaragua announced early last month 
that it was ending a 19monthold informal ceasefire 
the peace plan signed by the five presidents in august at tela 
honduras called for demobilization of the contras by dec 5 
coupled with democratic reforms by ortegas leftist government 
the agreement also said nicaragua would strengthen its internal 
conditions for national reconciliation which include elections 
scheduled for feb 25 and would encourage repatriation of the 
rebels 
however fitzwater told reporters the circumstances there do 
not fulfill the conditions of demobilization as set forth in the 
tela accords 
nicaragua was to provide the conditions that would be 
conducive for voluntary repatriation they have not met those 
obligations the sandinistas have broken the ceasefire have 
sought to undermine the election process by harassing the 
opposition 
fitzwater also said nicaragua had denied entry to observer teams 
and congressional delegations that wanted to monitor election 
preparations while nicaragua welcomed the observer mission headed 
by former president carter the sandinistas have not looked kindly 
on some other wouldbe observers 
reps sonny montgomery dmiss j roy rowland dga dana 
rohrabacher rcalif and chuck douglas rnh were denied visas 
last week they were representing a 20member commission named by 
president bush to observe election preparations but the sandinista 
government said the group would not be admitted because it was not 
independent 
in view of this situation the contras have no alternative 
fitzwater told reporters 
ceasefire negotiations were suspended nov 21 after the contras 
refused to go along with a sandinista demand for a partial 
withdrawal of rebel forces to base camps in honduras 
the contras declined to go beyond a pledge not to infiltrate 
more troops from base camps in honduras 
the sandinistas contend 2300 contras have infiltrated from 
honduras into nicaragua over recent weeks 
their operation from base camps along the honduran border where 
some 6000 rebels are encamped has been a bone of contention 
between honduras and nicaragua 
the contras blamed the sandinistas for suspension of the talks 
saying the rebels were willing to continue efforts to work out an 
agreement matamoros underscored that offer on wednesday 
but sandinista representatives maintained it was the consensus 
of all sides involved in the talks that were held in washington 
that negotiations were at an impasse

lithuanias parliament wednesday fell nine votes 
short of changing the republics constitution to legalize multiple 
political parties the first threat to the communist partys 
constitutionally guaranteed supremacy in the soviet union 
the 2191 vote was shy of the 228 needed for the twothirds 
majority but 84 deputies were absent and 30 abstained the 
parliament will vote again on the issue thursday said eduardas 
potashinskas an activist who watched a live television feed of the 
session in the lithuanian capital of vilnius 
also on wednesday the armenian legislature failed to draw a 
quorum large enough to consider a similar constitutional change 
said activist karen shakhbazyan in yerevan 
in moscow green photocopied cards appeared wednesday in subway 
stations and main streets calling for a twohour general strike 
monday to ask the congress of peoples deputies to rescind the same 
provision in the national constitution 
human rights activist andrei d sakharov and five fellow members 
of the soviet legislature signed the appeal 
article 6 which became part of the basic law of the soviet 
union with the constitution drawn up by leonid i brezhnev in 1977 
makes the communist party the leading and guiding force of soviet 
society eliminating it would help reduce the partys grip on on 
all spheres of life 
czechoslovakia east germany poland and hungary recently 
dropped similar provisions in their constitutions granting special 
status to their communist parties 
democracy is impossible with the kind of government with a 
constitution that sets the inequality of parties and the 
inequality of people who are their members lithuanian deputy 
albertas laurinchukas told his fellow deputies according to 
potashinskas 
sakharov and his fellow deputies are calling for the general 
strike monday to pressure the national congress into rescinding 
article 6 and voting on draft laws on land property and business 
enterprises congress starts its second semiannual session tuesday 
the government newspaper izvestia refused to publish the 
deputies call for the general strike said sakharovs wife yelena 
bonner 
it is of great importance that article 6 of the constitution 
be abandoned sakharov was quoted as saying by the soviet news 
bulletin interfax we cannot afford to bob in the wake of changes 
that are taking place in eastern europe 
in czechoslovakia the parliamentary action was preceded by a 
similar symbolic strike czechoslovak strike organizers publicized 
their plan through massive demonstrations wall posters and direct 
organizing at factories 
there has been little publicity in the soviet union on 
sakharovs suggestion thus far so the izvestia publication would 
have been invaluable 
still bonner said the whole country already knows about this 
appeal 
she said documents calling for the strike were distributed at a 
conference in moscow on dec 2 attended by representatives of 
voters clubs from 60 cities around the soviet union the appeal 
also was announced at the conference of russias front she said 
shakhbazyan said he had seen no publicity on sakharovs strike 
call in yerevan located 1100 miles south of moscow 
sakharov was quoted by interfax as saying that dropping the 
provision from the soviet constitution is extremely important in 
checking the crisis of confidence in the country 
he said that if the laws on property land and business 
enterprises are not considered at this session of the congress 
they cannot be approved until the next session six months away at 
the least he said the constitutional provisions standing in the 
way of certain reforms should be changed 
the supreme soviet working legislature is supposed to hammer out 
new laws but its parent body the larger congress must approve 
any changes in the constitution the congress meets just twice a 
year 
the supreme soviet voted last month to place consideration of 
article 6 on the congressional agenda but the proposal failed by a 
narrow margin 
the congress is the centerpiece of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs political reforms its 2250 deputies were elected in 
march in the countrys first competitive elections in more than 70 
years

nonviolent measures said yan jiaqi chairman of the front for a 
democratic china 
the front is an umbrella organization of the chinese democracy 
movement that has been criticized by chinese students and residents 
in the united states as lacking focus

work its a very important meeting yan said 
subjects on the agenda included how to separate personal 
finances from money donated since the student uprising was crushed 
by chinese authorities in baijings tiananmen square in june 
wuer kaixi one of the student leaders in tiananmen square now 
on a oneyear fellowship at harvard has in particular been

allegedly confusing his personal finances with the fronts finances 
representatives from chinese communities around the world were 
to report in an effort to lay out a specific program for the 
groups longterm operation

the justice department froze 618 million 
that a man accused of being a leading colombian drug trafficker 
kept in five nations by tracing financial records seized in a raid 
attorney general dick thornburgh said wednesday 
authorities froze bank accounts kept for jose gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha in this country luxembourg switzerland austria and britain 
after drug enforcement administration agents followed a paper trail 
left by the records thornburgh said 
the financial and property records were seized by colombian 
police during an october raid of a home owned by rodriguezs nephew 
and turned over to dea thornburgh said 
rodriguez one of the three leaders of colombias medellin drug 
cartel is among the 12 colombian drug traffickers most wanted by 
the justice department 
he faces drugtrafficking conspiracy and racketeering charges 
in florida and new york 
while mr rodriguez gocha remains at large he has been shorn 
of substantial assets provided by the illegal activiites with which 
he is charged thornburgh said 
this is not laundered money this is part of gachas personal 
financial net and we have taken that 618 million from gacha and 
his family as part of his personal assets said dea administrator 
jack lawn 
lawn said the records showed that rodriguez had given 81 
million to be invested on his behalf by mauricio vives a colombian 
associate who is at large 
dea was able to trace all but 20 million which was transferred 
into banks in panama lawn said 
vives had invested rodriguezs money in certificates of 
deposits highyield stocks and other financial instruments that 
were kept on deposit in the banks lawn said 
what we were dealing with is a highly sophisticated 
moneymoving operation thornburgh said these were not funds 
that were being laundered they had found a home 
the operation was first disclosed nov 7 in congressional 
testimony by terrence m burke the acting deputy dea 
administrator at the time burke declined to dislose the name of 
the drug figure whose assets were frozen 
lawn said the records seized from the home of alfonso rodriguez 
munoz may enable dea to trace the assets of other cartel figures 
the attorney general credited unprecedented international 
cooperation by colombia and the other nations that helped dea 
quickly trace the funds and freeze bank accounts kept for rodriguez 
containing certificates of deposit stocks and other financial 
instruments 
the timeliness of the asset information provided by the 
government of colombia its completeness and the speed of 
transmittal were examplary thornburgh said 
swift and decisive action not bureaucratic delay was the 
order of the day thornburgh said 
the attorney general declined to identify any of the banks where 
rodriguez kept his money but thornburgh said none of the financial 
institutions was under investigation 
authorities in luxembourg froze 10 accounts containing 394 
million and obtained another 2 million that had been stashed over 
the border in west german banks 
also frozen were accounts containing 103 million in 
switzerland 59 million in austria 42 million in britain and 
2 million in this country thornburgh said 
the justice department has initiated forfeiture proceedings for 
the money kept in the us accounts justice department spokesman 
david runkel said he expected some the 2 million will be shared 
with the colombian government the rest will go into the us 
treasury 
it was not clear how much of the money in foreign banks would be 
forfeited the justice department said the laws of the four other 
nations would determine how authorities in those nations would 
dispose of the money

who could predict that little boys would go crazy 
over teenage mutant ninja turtles or that little girls would fall 
in love with cabbage patch dolls 
mark kellerman gets paid to try 
as senior toy buyer for one of the nations largest retail 
variety franchisers kellerman spends hours figuring out what toys 
will be hits with kids and which ones will end up gathering dust 
under the bed 
his decisions based on visits to toy shows scrutiny of 
manufacturers advertising spending and playing with the toys 
himself help determine financial success for ben franklin variety 
stores where toys are big business 
ben franklin founded in the 1920s operates 1300 stores 
nationwide 
how can a 41yearold balding bearded businessman know what 
kids want 
youve got to be a child thats never really grown up youve 
got to love the product youve got to love to play with it 
kellerman said wednesday in an interview from his office in 
suburban carol stream 
he also relies on advice from his son who was 12 when kellerman 
started in the business four years ago and now has inside 
information on what older kids want 
but kellerman is the first to admit that getting inside the 
mercurial mind of a child isnt easy 
why is ninja turtle popular and master of the universe no one 
wants anymore he said 
i will see probably 100 new toy lines each year which ones 
will sell which ones wont is probably anybodys guess 
hits this christmas include thimblesized vehicles called micro 
machines nintendo video games and barbie whose popularity is 
grounded in tradition kellerman said 
toys based on television or comicbook cartoon characters like 
the ninja turtles and ghostbusters action figures are frequently 
big hits 
those based on movie characters like batman often enjoy big 
but shortlived success he said 
kellerman said he looks for toys that will have more longterm 
appeal 
due to the nature of the manufacturing business products are 
promoted to buyers long before they go on store shelves the 
american international toy fair in new york where buyers go to get 
ideas for what their stores will offer at christmas is held months 
earlier in february 
thats the hardest part of the job looking at an item in 
march and trying to decide what a 7year old will want in seven 
months kellerman said 
in the toy business demand ends rather abruptly he said 
take cabbage patch dolls 
five years ago they were the status symbol of the sandbox set 
stores couldnt keep them in stock but they became passe as their 
owners aged and financial problems plagued the manufacturer coleco 
industries kellerman said 
but hasbro inc took over the cabbage patch license and is 
spending millions of dollars to revive them he said predicting 
cabbage patch will make a comback next year 
toy manufacturers love that kind of talk and depend heavily on 
buyers like kellerman 
buyer reaction is critical not only in terms of placing 
orders but their input can change a product they might make a 
suggestion that could determine the success of a product said 
jody levin spokeswoman for toy manufacturers of america the 
industry trade group in new york 
buyers are the first link with consumers she said 
kellerman is one businessman who takes his work home he has 
several toys of his own include a collection of radiocontrolled 
vehicles 
theres some great concepts great engineering on some of 
these things he said

left and rightwing politicians battled 
wednesday over whether to ban two songs by pop stars about the 
palestinian uprising from staterun radio and television 
rightwing members of the broadcast authoritys administrative 
committee pushed through a ban of a kid alone by chava 
alberstein and the flood can come after us by nurit galron 
arguing the songs were plolike and could damage the morale of 
the state 
but after the 42 vote tuesday the ban was delayed for two 
weeks pending an appeal by leftleaning members of the committee 
said vered lyon spokeswoman for education minister yitzhak navon 
the broadcast authority is part of the education ministry 
shlomo kor deputy chairman of the administrative committee is 
leading the fight for a ban this is not just music these are 
political views he said 
these songs are against our nation why do we have to 
broadcast them added kor a member of prime minister yitzhaks 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
aharon harel chairman of the committee said the effort to ban 
the songs marches the broadcast authority into the dark ages 
harel is like navon a member of the leftleaning labor party 
ms lyon said navon planned to hold a hearing on the songs in 
two weeks and would bring the issuebefore the full broadcast 
authority or the parliament 
ms galron vowed to fight the ban saying she believed it was 
part of an effort to keep information about the uprising from the 
public 
in the beginning they tried to cover our eyes now they are 
trying to gag us she told the daily maariv 
in the flood can come after us already banned on israels 
armed forces radio ms galron accuses israelis of indifference to 
the violence in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
no dont tell me about a little girl who lost an eye 
it only makes me feel bad 
i dont like hearing about people oppressed or tortured 
i dont care what is happening in the territories 
we will make love and live our lives tel aviv is life 
ms alberstein was overseas and unavailable for comment her 
song a kid alone is a modern version of a traditional song 
describing the oppression of the jewish people 
alberstein sings the almost 1000yearold song in the original 
aramaic language and then adds in hebrew 
how long will the wave of violence continue 
chasing and chased beating and beaten 
when will this madness stop

nearly a year after a bomb blew apart pan am 
flight 103 over scotland and killed 270 people little has been 
done to improve airport security worldwide according to a report 
published wednesday 
paul wilkinson the author of the report and an expert on 
international terrorism said obsolete security measures cannot 
detect modern plastic explosives used by terrorists 
we are way behind in taking the necessary measures that will 
help to prevent this kind of tragedy happening again said 
wilkinson a professor at scotlands university of st andrews 
another lockerbie could happen tomorrow he said at a news 
conference 
flight 103 exploded over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 
all 259 people aboard the new yorkbound flight and 11 on the 
ground were killed 
investigators have said a bomb containing powerful plastic 
explosives was concealed in a radiocassette player packed in a 
suitcase in the boeing 747s forward hold 
the flight originated in frankfurt and passengers and baggage 
transferred to a larger plane at londons heathrow airport 
a department of transport spokesman declined to comment on the 
specific allegations in the report but said since lockerbie we 
have taken a large number of security measures relating to both 
aircraft and airports 
the spokesman who by custom was not identified said the 
measures include tightened security involving the handling of cabin 
and hold baggage and cargo on us airlines operating here and 
tightened security and pass requirements at all airports 
wilkinsons report said airlines airports and governments all 
are responsible for improving airport security 
it said more people have been killed in airport and airplane 
bombings in the past five years than in hijackings over the past 50 
years 1059 compared with 638 
many passengers do not apparently realize that aviation 
terrorism acts now vie with technical failure and pilot error as 
major causes of fatalities in civil aviation the report said 
in the poor countries of africa and asia security is no more 
than cosmetic with airports often lacking equipment and trained 
staff wilkinson said 
even in wealthy countries such as the united states airports 
are full of major security loopholes he said passengers are 
poorly screened if at all and not all baggage is accompanied by 
passengers he said 
he said sophisticated machines capable of detecting colorless 
odorless plastic explosives are being tested in the united states 
and should be refined and installed at airports without delay 
wilkinson said the continuing lack of preventive measures was 
demonstrated on sept 19 when a uta french airliner exploded over 
nigers tenere desert killing all 171 people on board 
the disaster had all the hallmarks of an african lockerbie 
he said wilkinson said intelligence and police agencies have 
failed to coordinate counterterrorism strategies sometimes because 
of rivalries 
this has become all too evident in the welter of international 
confusion and recrimination over the international hunt for the 
lockerbie bombers he said 
scottish and west german police have denied published reports of 
poor cooperation in their hunt for the bombers 
wilkinson said one major lesson from the lockerbie crash is the 
need to stay one step ahead of terrorists 
when terrorists find it harder to plant bombs on aircraft they 
are likely to turn to other tactics such as shooting them down with 
surfacetoair missiles he said 
in an age of terrorism when aviation will continue to be an 
attractive target of high publicity value to the terrorist we can 
never afford to relax our vigilance

president elias hrawi was quoted 
wednesday as saying he would give gen michel aoun the rebellious 
army commander he fired two weeks to leave the presidential palace 
peacefully 
leaders of the nationalist front a loose alliance of 
syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions called for a general 
strike thursday to protest aouns attempts to partition lebanon 
hrawi a maronite catholic like the general said moslem army 
units under gen emile lahoud the new commander were preparing a 
plan to invade the christian enclave where aoun is entrenched and 
dislodge him if necessary 
soldiers loyal to aoun fought syrianbacked moslem militias 
wednesday for a second day in beirut and hills above the city 
police reported one person killed and three wounded 
the independent newspaper annahar quoted hrawi as saying in an 
interview im giving goodwill mediators a week or two to produce 
fruitful results 
but he stressed that he will not compromise regarding unity of 
the legal authorities 
the presidential palace in baabda has become a symbol that 
should not be given away to anyone hrawi said 
he said i and the government will soon rule from baabda an 
eastern suburb 
in another interview published by the kuwaiti daily alqabas 
hrawi was quoted as saying i prefer to reach the baabda palace 
carrying an olive branch but otherwise it will be by the canon 
both interviews were conducted at an army barracks in ablah in 
syriancontrolled east lebanon where hrawi has set up temporary 
headquarters pending a settlement with aoun 
aoun commands 20000 soldiers deployed in the 310squaremile 
christian enclave north and east of beirut lahoud has won the 
allegiance of the 22000 moslem soldiers based in regions policed 
by syria 
syria maintains 40000 soldiers in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league peacekeeping mandate the syrians who control 70 percent of 
lebanese territory fought a sixmonth war with aouns troops 
earlier this year 
aoun named head of an interim military cabinet last year has 
rejected a peace plan approved by lebananese parliament members in 
october he says it should have set a specific timetable for 
withdrawal of syrian forces and has refused to yield the 
presidential palace 
the parliamentary accord cleared the way for election of rene 
mouawad as president who was killed by a bomb after 17 days and 
replaced by hrawi 
the syrianbacked hrawi in a statement distributed by his 
office said wednesday he was against partition and determined to 
achieve national reconciliation 
we are determined to reunify the nation he said 
i have instructed the new army commander gen emile lahoud 
to prepare himself for entering east beirut hrawi said 
in another development three people were killed and five 
wounded tuesday when a masked man opened random fire with an 
automatic rifle at pedestrians in the palestinian refugee camp of 
ein elhilweh in south lebanon police said the attacker escaped

the finnish exchange student who was 
moved to a new family in a different town to get him away from his 
american girlfriend is back with her in the town he considers home 
but at the cost of his sponsorship 
i really do like these people here theyre so friendly 
people iiro lehtinen said wednesday 
the education foundation for foreign study transferred lehtinen 
18 of kiriviem finland from his host family and school in 
farmington to south portland maine on nov 11 
the foundation said he was spending too much time with his 
girlfriend kelly lapointe and not enough with his host family 
i really like her very much shes i cant find the 
words said lehtinen 
on tuesday after much media attention and protests by the 
teenagers parents friends and the finnish embassy the 
foundation released him from the program so he could return to 
farmington 
lehtinen said he will remain in farmington for the rest of the 
school year with lou and rod waldron who offered to take him in 
ive never seen iiro smile so much in my life lapointe 17 
said wednesday she and her parents drove to south portland to pick 
lehtinen up tuesday night we were going to go in the morning 
but he said come now 
im glad its over and im glad hes coming home he considers 
farmington his american home she said 
their forced separation had led to a walkout by about 100 
farmington high school pupils about onethird of the student body 
and angered the couples parents 
it was a very big headache and im not sure exactly why 
said meg holliday the foundations eastern regional director in 
cambridge mass 
lehtinens parents likely will be reimbursed for the money they 
gave the foundation to pay for his expenses holliday said the 
financial details have not been worked out lehtinen will get 
another type of visa under the waldrons sponsorship 
holliday said lehtinen was taken off the program after officials 
spoke with his parents in finland and agreed that his goals had 
become incompatible with the programs 
lehtinens father had lobbied the education foundations offices 
in finland in an effort to get his son returned to farmington 
lehtinen said his father architecht kimmo lehtinen hopes to 
visit him in farmington just down the street from the lapointe 
house sometime before christmas 
state rep william tsiros said he got the good news late tuesday 
from holliday 
tsiros said an attache at the finnish embassy in washington had 
been angered when she learned about the transfer earlier 
she said she was going to call the education foundation 
officials and was very irate at the whole situation tsiros said 
i dont know what she said but it worked i got the call from 
meg holliday a few hours later 
the relationship between lapointe and lehtinen began in 
september foundation officials said lehtinen was not told to break 
up with lapointe but only to cool the relationship enough so he 
could spend more time with his host family 
susan jackson the foundations regional coordinator in berwick 
maine said many aspects of an exchange experience including the 
students temporary adoption by an american family were 
overlooked as the story of thwarted young love took on a life of 
its own 
i feel confident that the foundation made the right decision 
but unfortunately that has become secondary in the eyes of the 
press to the marketability of a love story she said 
according to jackson and holliday lehtinens original host 
parents in farmington mike and diane crowley would not see much 
of him for days at a time they said he would leave early in the 
morning for school and return late at night more like a boarder 
than a temporary family member 
the families are volunteers and they expect and perhaps 
deserve some interaction with the student they are harboring 
holliday said

the supreme court entered the wrenching 
right to die controversy wednesday as lawyers clashed over 
whether to permit the withdrawal of lifesustaining nutrition from 
a 32yearold comatose missouri woman 
william colby a lawyer for the parents of nancy cruzan told 
the justices that if the woman were lucid for a moment and could 
come before this court she would choose liberty and ask for 
removal of the feeding tube but he said the woman will never 
recover 
assistant attorney general robert presson of missouri countered 
that ms cruzans parents have no right to precipitate their 
daughters death particularly without clear and convincing 
evidence she would choose to die 
letting her die goes against the states interest in 
preventing suicide he said 
the hourlong argument over legal doctrine came in the first 
right to die case the court has agreed to decide no ruling is 
expected for several months 
the justices who recently have been reluctant to expand 
individual rights gave no clear signals on the likely outcome of 
the case as they peppered the lawyers with questions 
the womans parents joe and joyce cruzan attended the 
hourlong argument session with another daughter and two 
granddaughters and he later said it certainly was a very 
painful thing to sit through 
the parents want the high court to overturn a missouri supreme 
court ruling that bars removal of the feeding tube that is keeping 
their daughter alive the state court dismissed statements ms 
cruzan was said to have made about not wanting to remain alive in a 
vegetative condition 
an estimated 10000 people in this country are being kept alive 
in a similar manner 
colby said a surgically implanted tube bringing food and water 
into the womans stomach should be removed 
ms cruzan is an unconscious shell in a roomful of strangers 
for the rest of her life he said all thought and ability to 
react with the world around her is gone she will never recover 
he said if ms cruzan was lucid for a moment and could come 
before this court she would ask for removal of the feeding tube 
her liberty interest is as important as her right to life in 
this case the lawyer said she would choose liberty 
however justice anthony m kennedy told colby you presume 
there is a liberty to die without clear and convincing evidence 
of the patients wishes 
on the other hand justice sandra day oconnor asked missouris 
assistant attorney general whether he thought the missouri supreme 
court which barred removal of the feeding tube based its ruling 
on the best interests of the patient 
i have been concerned because its not clear to me what 
standard the missouri supreme court set she said 
justice antonin scalia said if the court were to decide there is 
a right for parents to decide between life and death for an 
incompetent offspring wouldnt that lead inevitably to a right 
for the state to decide as well 
solicitor general kenneth starr the bush administrations top 
courtroom lawyer argued that states should be given wide 
latitude to develop approaches that reflect reasonably the values 
of the people in this highly sensitive and deeply vexing 
situation 
a high court ruling is expected by july even if the justices 
decide there is no constitutional right to die or that it cannot 
be exercised by a parent or guardian of an incompetent person 
states will remain free to let doctors remove lifesustaining 
treatment from certain patients 
but such a ruling might prompt lower courts to make it more 
difficult for physicians and family members to terminate treatment 
ms cruzan suffered severe brain damage in a car crash nearly 
seven years ago and is in what doctors call a permanent vegetative 
condition 
her body is rigid her hands and feet constricted and bent into 
claw shapes she can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are 
open and move randomly 
doctors say she could live for 30 years or more in her current 
condition unless the feeding tube is removed 
the righttodie issue attracted national attention in 1976 when 
the new jersey supreme court allowed the family of karen ann 
quinlan to order removal of a respirator helping her breathe ms 
quinlan in a similar comalike state continued to be fed through 
a tube and lived for nine more years 
american courts since generally have permitted removal of 
lifesustaining treatment for such patients 
the american medical association estimates 70 percent of 
americans at some time will be involved in a decision about whether 
to provide lifesustaining medical care for themselves or family 
members 
fortyone states including missouri have living will laws 
that allow people to preauthorize the termination of 
lifesustaining treatment missouris livingwill law which does 
not allow for removal of feeding tubes was not in effect when ms 
cruzan was injured

sen alan cranston on wednesday called on fbi 
director william sessions to look for a government source for a 
news story saying the bureau is investigating a voter registration 
group operated by the senators son 
it makes my blood boil to see attempts to smear my son and 
drag him into the mud the california democrat said in a 
statement released at his office he also urged an investigation of 
a republicanfinanced voter registration group 
leaks must not be tolerated among those who are responsible 
for law enforcement cranston said leaks undermine our legal 
system 
cranstons statement came in response to a published report that 
federal law enforcement authorities were investigating the center 
for participation in democracy operated by cranstons son kim 
the investigation is aimed at determining whether the tax exempt 
group sought to register more democrats than republicans according 
to the report which appeared in wednesday editions of the new york 
times 
cranston said in his statement that his son has the highest 
ethical standards i have ever known in anyone 
i know personally from kim of the exquisite pains he took to 
ensure that registration drives he was associated with were legal 
proper and bipartisan said cranston 
cranston and four other senators already were under fire for 
intervening with federal regulators on behalf of lincoln savings 
and loan of california while receiving substantial campaign 
contributions from charles keating jr who headed the institution 
keating also contributed to kim cranstons voter group 
fred reagan a spokesman for the fbi in los angeles refused to 
comment on whether the bureau is conducting such an investigation 
but documents released by the house banking committee which 
conducted hearings into the failure of lincoln sampl show that 
california officials turned over to the fbi material relating to 
the voter registration groups 
richard newsom an examiner for the california department of 
savings and loan provided the fbi office in santa ana calif 
with copies of documents such as state forms declaring the center 
for participation in democracy a charitable trust 
meantime rob giannangeli a spokesman for the internal revenue 
service in los angeles also said he could not comment on whether 
there was an investigation of the voter registration groups 
if in fact the fbi is investigating the center for 
participation in democracy i suggest that it not limit is 
investigations to groups alleged to be seeking to register 
potential democratic voters and that it look into 
republicaninspired registration groups as well cranston said 
i also suggest the press likewise make its investigations 
evenhanded and bipartisan he added 
he called for an investigation to determine what motivated joe 
rodgers who was chairman of the reaganbush campaign in 1984 to 
found americans for responsible government which in 1985 became 
vote america he described the group as a republicansupported 
nonpartisan voter registration organization 
how much money did he raise for vote america or related 
registration efforts and from whom cranston asked 
he also called for an inquiry into any connection between 
republicaninspired registration drives and conservative groups 
such as the moral majority the american coalition for traditional 
values the american christian voice foundation the american 
defense foundation and the responsible government for america 
foundation 
cranston said his voterregistration efforts were motivated by 
a simple principle the health indeed the very future of our 
democracy depends on the fullest possible voter participation by 
all segments of our population

jury deliberations began wednesday in the 
manslaughter trial of a hispanic policeman accused of firing on a 
motorcycle and killing two black men setting off three days of 
racial violence 
rumors swept the city that officer william lozano had been found 
innocent or was about to be found innocent court officials said 
dade countys highestranking state judge went on live television 
to deny them 
the jury which got the case after almost seven weeks of 
hearings and testimony adjourned for the day at 6 pm after 
deliberating for nine hours deliberations were to resume thursday 
lozano 31 faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of 
motorcycle driver clement lloyd 23 and his passenger allan 
blanchard 24 
the rumors caused some downtown office workers to leave work 
early court officials said 
in the unusual live television appearance dade chief circuit 
judge gerald wetherington called for calm 
there is no reason for concern on the part of anybody in the 
community wetherington said there is no indication there will 
be any verdict tonight 
the judge revealed that the trial judge circuit judge joseph 
farina may seal any verdict and delay announcing it for an 
undetermined time 
innocent verdicts for police officers accused of killing miami 
blacks have touched off violence twice before in this decade 
but mayor xavier suarez and other officials expressed hope that 
the presence of two blacks on lozanos jury would demonstrate the 
process was fair whatever the verdict 
prosecutors say lozano fired unnecessarily when lloyd on his 
motorcycle fled a police car after a traffic violation lozano said 
he fired in selfdefense when lloyd tried to run him down 
deliberations were delayed for almost an hour after prosecutors 
discovered a typographical error in jury instructions given tuesday 
the written copy in the jurys hands omitted the word or 
between two prosecution theories that lozano committed an 
intentional act or was guilty of culpable neglgence the written 
copy made it appear prosecutors had to prove both not just one 
said chief assistant state attorney john hogan 
the judge over the objections of defense attorneys roy black 
and mark seiden agreed to insert the word in the jurys written 
instructions then denied seidens motion for a mistrial the judge 
said the defense had the option of appeal in case of a conviction 
the courtroom was sealed so the jurors could deliberate there 
because the extensive evidence would not fit in the small jury 
chamber

general assembly to spare the sponsors the embarrassment of losing 
a vote on the resolution 
assembly president joseph garba of nigeria urged on tuesday that 
the resolution be withdrawn and the arab delegations met wednesday 
morning and agreed to respond positively to the appeal the 
arabs announced

appeared to have more than enough support in the 159nation 
assembly

the peace corps is heading to eastern europe for 
the first time to help hungary cope with rapid changes that are 
creating a need for volunteer teachers the agencys director said

countries including yugoslavia and czechoslovakia for instruction 
on everything from health care to business administration director 
paul d coverdell said

the communist premier agreed 
wednesday to name a new cabinet including members suggested by a 
popular opposition that rejects the current government he said he 
would quit unless the crisis is resolved 
opposition leader vaclav havel said premier ladislav adamec 
agreed to deliver a list of ministers friday the two had a long 
tough negotiating session tuesday and a brief meeting wednesday 
adamec confronted by mass disapproval when he chose a new 
government dec 3 said on television after havels news conference 
he would resign if the political crisis continued the opposition 
has threatened a general strike monday if he does not have a new 
government 
ctk the official news agency said adamec accepted a list of 
possible candidates from civic forum the noncommunist opposition 
group havel leads and would consult with other official political 
parties 
it quoted him as saying he probably would meet with civic forum 
again friday adamec said on television he had talked with civic 
forum and other groups but i dont know if we will reach 
agreement as far as changes are concerned 
his television address indicated there had been tough bargaining 
with the opposition he said it was difficult to persuade 
professionals favored by the opposition to join the cabinet in a 
fluid political situation where the public mood changes from day 
to day and hour to hour 
unless the situation calms and the government wins public 
confidence adamec said he would have no choice but to step down 
if the government does not have these conditions i cannot 
take any responsibility for what happens he said in this 
case there is only one honest solution for me to ask the 
president of the republic to let me resign 
i feel sorry that in the event i resign as premier i wont 
be able to help the society to overcome the crisis he added he 
did not give a time frame for deciding whether to stay in office 
a ctk dispatch said the politburo of the slovak republics 
communist party resigned in advance of a special slovak party 
congress scheduled for dec 17 the czech republic 
czechoslovakias other region has a new government with a 
noncommunist majority 
havel said communist party chief karel urbanek who held a 
75minute meeting with him wednesday agreed with the opposition 
that young able people and experts who are not discredited 
should be brought into the government 
opposition leaders want such an interim government to create 
the legal base for parliamentary democracy and hold free elections 
in july 
czechoslovakia has moved rapidly toward democracy since brutal 
police repression of a student demonstration nov 17 started a mass 
prodemocracy movement and antigovernment protests 
in two weeks the communists have relinquished their 41year 
monopoly on power reversed 21 years of hardline policy on the 
prague spring reforms of 1968 by condemning the sovietled invasion 
that crushed them and said free elections are likely next year 
adamec named a new cabinet last sunday but included only five 
noncommunists and left communists in charge of key ministries 
at his news conference havel refused to disclose details of his 
negotiations with adamec opposition sources said some form of 
power sharing was envisioned but whether that would lead to a 
government led by noncommunists as in poland was not clear 
on tuesday the first government with a noncommunist majority 
chosen in czechoslovakia in 41 years was named to lead the czech 
regional administration communists retained the leadership and 
deputy leadership of the government along with the interior 
ministry and key economic posts 
jiri dienstbier civic forum spokesman called the new czech 
government a step in the right direction 
in washington the state department said the latest developments 
give reformers in the communist party a chance to demonstrate 
statesmanship by working with civic forum and the czechoslovakian 
people to lay the foundation for political reform and a transition 
to true democracy 
the urbanekhavel meeting was the first between the communist 
party chief and the opposition leader who only a month ago was a 
banned dissident playwright reviled in the official press havel 
said urbanek admitted his party faces deeply rooted mistrust 
and must change 
urbanek also assured the opposition the party paramilitary 
force the peoples militia had been disarmed by the army and 
probably would be absorbed into the armed forces 
the opposition also wants the secret police disbanded havel 
said urbanek acknowledged the secret police has lost all its 
purpose for internal matters but whether it would be dissolved 
was not clear 
as the session ended urbanek was heard telling actor milan 
knazko the opposition leader in slovakia the most important 
thing now is to calm peoples emotions so that we dont have a food 
rationing system tomorrow 
that indicated the communists want to resolve the political 
crisis before it affects the economy and supplies of consumer 
goods which are fairly plentiful compared with the rest of eastern 
europe 
on tuesday the opposition won another victory when a 
parliamentary commission investigating the brutality nov 17 named 
ousted party chief milos jakes and former prague party boss 
miroslav stepan as politically responsible for it 
naming those responsible was among the main opposition demands 
on wednesday the opposition also demanded new public prosecutors 
be chosen for both the federal system and czech region

third world loan losses at big new york banks 
and souring real estate markets in the northeast and arizona pushed 
commercial banking into the red last summer for the first time in 
more than two years the government said wednesday 
the nations 12824 banks lost 744 million in the 
julyseptember quarter off sharply from 7 billion in profits in 
the second quarter and 73 billion in the first three months of 
the year the federal deposit insurance corp said 
for the first nine months banks earned 137 billion almost 5 
billion less than same period of 1988 
the thirdquarter loss was the first negative quarter since 
banks lost 106 billion in the apriljune period of 1987 that 
loss was also caused by large banks writing off developing country 
debt 
meanwhile fdic chairman l william seidman issued a new and 
more pessimistic assessment of prospects for the insurance fund 
backing bank deposits up to 100000 per account drawing criticism 
from congress 
he said the fund will shrink between 250 million and 500 
million this year to about 138 billion posting the second loss 
in its history the fund declined by about 4 billion in 1988 when 
bank failures hit a postdepression record of 221 this year bank 
failures should top 200 but miss breaking last years record he 
said 
in september seidman had predicted his fund would break even or 
post a slight loss rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the 
house banking subcommittee on financial institutions said the new 
estimate shows the fdic should be more aggressively regulating 
commercial banks 
annunzio likened seidman to outgoing savings and loan regulator 
m danny wall who endured grueling criticism from congress for 
underestimating the scope of the sampl crisis 
bill seidman should have spent more time doing his job at the 
fdic instead of running around the country telling everyone what a 
bad job danny wall was doing annunzio said in a prepared 
statement 
fdic spokesman alan whitney said annunzios charge was simply 
not true adding that seidmans only public criticism of wall has 
been for the sampl regulators decision to shift the supervision of 
lincoln savings and loan association irvine calif from regional 
examiners in san francisco to examiners in washington 
economist robert litan of the brooking institution a washington 
think tank said if banks unrecognized losses are taken into 
account the fdic probably has reserves closer to 9 billion than to 
13 billion 
seidman has disputed that assessment but litan noted hes 
moving closer to reality 
the fdic chairman said he revised his assessment of the 
insurance fund because of growing bank losses on real estate loans 
for commercial development and condo projects he urged banks to 
exercise more caution in the area 
although bank profits overall likely will bounce back in the 
final three months of 1989 the number of sour real estate loans 
will continue to rise he predicted 
i dont want to scrooge up christmas but im afraid the 
fourth quarter will show a continuation of the real estate trends 
we see here seidman said 
over the last 12 months real estate loan growth has accounted 
for nearly twothirds of all bank asset growth and now comprises 
almost onefourth of all commercial bank assets 
delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour 
loans nationally he said in the northeast the percentage of 
delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year he said 
the states with the highest percentage of bad real estate loans 
at the end of the third quarter were arizona 1228 percent texas 
1053 percent alaska 1040 percent oklahoma 607 percent 
louisiana 581 percent massachussets 476 percent new mexico 
424 percent connecticut 385 percent new york 378 percent and 
new hampshire 369 percent 
however the problems in the oilproducing states have been 
longstanding and are improving markets in the northeast continue 
to deteriorate 
the concentration of thirdquarter losses shows the influence of 
writedowns for developing country debt five of the nations 10 
largest banks accounted for 53 billion loss 
banks in four states loss money new york 57 billion 
arizona 333 million texas 219 million and louisiana 7 
million banks in 46 states puerto rico and the district of 
columbia reported earnings 
private analysts predicted that several other large banks most 
notably citicorp could add to third world debt loss reserves in 
the next few quarters they said banks real estate portfolios 
would continue to deteriorate and that bank loans for leveraged 
buyout deals would begin to show up as losses 
the real estate problem is serious and is dragging what were 
once considered rather pristine regional banks down into the muck 
with texas institutions said economist paul getman of the wefa 
group a bala cynwyd pa forecasting firm

mudar badran the new prime minister 
announced a cabinet on wednesday that does not include the 
fundamentalist moslem brotherhood movement the largest bloc in 
parliament 
badran named the 23member cabinet after three days of arguments 
with brotherhood leaders who demanded they be assigned six key 
portfolios including that of education which is of particular 
importance in the arab world 
instead badran 55 serving as prime minister for a third time 
since 1976 chose six moderate islamists with no ties to the 
brotherhood islamists are independent very religious and advocate 
islamic influence in society but do not follow a particular party 
islamists were assigned the ministries of agriculture justice 
religious affairs planning and health a sixth was made state 
minister for parliamentary affairs 
the brotherhood said it should have onefourth of the cabinet 
posts because its candidates won 25 seats last month in jordans 
first parliamentary elections in 22 years independent islamists 
won nine seats in the 80member chamber 
badran kept the defense portfolio for himself and chose marwan 
kassem and salem massade deputy prime ministers for foreign 
affairs and interior respectively 
other appointments included youssef mubayideen as justice 
minister mohammed hamdan for education and ziad fareez to head the 
industry and trade ministry and ibrahim izzeddine as information 
minister 
abdul munem abu zant a leading brotherhood deputy told the 
associated press we have a strong presence in parliament and we 
have the right to dictate our condition on the shape of the 
government 
other brotherhood sources said the group had sought the 
education works social development labor higher education and 
information portfolios 
that would have given the group which advocates stricter 
islamic laws control over the direction of future generations 
in the westernoriented country a political analyst commented 
the most important ministry for the islamic line is the 
education ministry to safeguard this generation and the future ones 
from the diminishing islamic ideologies and social behavior in view 
of pluralism of nonislamic thought and ideologies abu zant said 
by law the new cabinet has to appear before parliament for a 
vote of confidence within 30 days if approved by a simple majority 
of 41 votes the government will be installed if not king hussein 
will have to name a new prime minister 
in all there are 13 new faces in the government ten served in 
previous governments and six held posts in the outgoing cabinet of 
zeid bin shaker 
shaker resigned monday in accordance with the constitution 
which requires the cabinet that oversaw legislative elections bow 
out once parliament is installed 
badrans government includes six members of palestinian origin 
down from seven in the previous 24member cabinet of zeid bin 
shaker

unmarried girls under age 18 would have to 
get parental permission before obtaining an abortion in michigan 
under a bill passed wednesday by the house despite the governors 
promise to veto it 
before passing the measure by a 6539 vote lawmakers rejected 
nearly 50 amendments including one to require boys to take some 
responsibility for preventing teenage pregnancy by wearing condoms 
the senate which already has passed a similar measure is 
expected to take up the legislation before it breaks for the 
holidays next week 
that sets up a promised veto by gov james blanchard who has 
pledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights 
william kandler a spokesman for blanchard said the governor 
wouldnt change his mind despite a survey by the detroit news that 
suggests michigan residents favor a parental consent requirement by 
a 31 margin 
im hopeful the governor will think about parents and not his 
own personal beliefs said barbara listing president of right to 
life of michigan 
margy long a spokeswoman for planned parenthood of michigan 
said she was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the 
house floor asking the governor to veto the bill 
that is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109member 
house although the antiabortion side says it has enough votes for 
an override in the senate 
the legislature has overridden only one veto in the past 38 
years that in 1977 on a obscure administrative rules bill 
the legislation allows a girl to petition a probate court to 
have an abortion if she believes she cant tell her parents or if 
her parents refuse to let her have an abortion 
only two substantive amendments were successful during the 
lengthy floor debate 
one would require schools to provide information about the law 
and tell girls how they could seek a judges permission for an 
abortion 
the other would allow a psychologist or psychiatrist who has 
been treating the child to petition the court on her behalf if they 
believe the girl would commit suicide if she couldnt obtain an 
abortion without telling her parents 
opponents of the bill say its merely intended to make it more 
difficult for girls to get an abortion because at least 70 percent 
of pregnant minors in michigan already bring at least one parent to 
an abortion clinic with them 
rep maxine berman said the bill might encourage girls in tragic 
situations to resort to desperate measures 
this bill is meant to put the squeeze on teenagers with no 
regard to the horrible alternatives they may seek said rep 
maxine berman can any of you live with yourself if a woman 
resorts to a backalley abortion or to crack cocaine to induce 
abortion or to suicide i dont want any more young people to 
die 
were talking about the very bedrock of our society family 
countered rep michael griffin sponsor of the bill we recognize 
there are families in trouble thats why we put the judicial 
bypass in there

president francois mitterrand of france 
met with mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday and sounded a note of 
caution later about german reunification 
he flew to kiev the ukrainian capital 465 miles south of 
moscow for a sixhour working visit and talks with gorbachev about 
the political changes in eastern europe the soviet president 
briefed mitterrand on his twoday malta summit with president bush 
mitterrand later told a joint news conference west germany must 
be more firmly anchored to its european partners 
the evolution of the east must lead the west toward its own 
structures he said 
gorbachev said he and the french president had a substantial 
discussion on the future of germany which divided into two 
nations after world war ii 
on tuesday in moscow gorbachev told the west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher the soviet union regards east 
germany as a faithful ally important guarantor of peace and 
stability in europe in kiev he said mitterrands visit had not 
changed his view 
the soviet position has been that the existence of two germanys 
has helped stabilize europe since the war 
in restating it gorbachev said any artificial prodding and 
pushing of this question german reunification could only make the 
processes taking place more difficult 
he did not rule out the possibility of a unified german in the 
future but said the issue was not topical now 
mitterrand holds the revolving chairmanship of the 12nation 
european community he has voiced support for the possibility of a 
united germany but on wednesday seemed to say west germany should 
participate in moves the french leader champions for a more united 
western europe 
the most urgent question is to strengthen the european 
community mitterrand said this will establish a new element 
in the european reality 
he has pushed for a federal europe that would tie the economies 
of common market nations closer together through monetary union by 
the mid1990s and eventually a single currency 
germany invaded both france and the soviet union in world war 
ii and mitterrand said current german rulers must consider the 
opinions of other european nations on the reunification issue 
it is premature now to think of redrawing boundaries he said 
and appeared to give gorbachev a pledge that france would seek 
restraint from west german chancellor helmut kohl on german 
confederation 
we should refrain from anything that would poison a quite 
complex situation he said i have confidence in the german 
leaders 
mitterrand backed gorbachevs proposal made last thursday for 
an alleuropean summit in 1990 to speed integration of the 
continent and eliminate eastwest divisions 
gorbachev also said his meeting with bush was a major world 
event in an increasingly dynamic dialogue between east and west 
as the leaders spoke more than 1000 ukrainian nationalists 
gathered outside on lenin square behind police barricades carrying 
banners reading down with censorship and free all political 
prisoners 
a soviet official said the meeting was held in kiev because it 
is an hour closer to paris by plane

charlton heston played moses again parting 
the waters of a fountain and 25 high school bands blared show 
tunes as thousands of culture lovers celebrated the music centers 
25th anniversary wednesday 
who is on the lords side let him come to me the bearded 
heston thundered from a podium holding aloft the real stick he 
used to part the red sea in the classic film the ten 
commandments 
the masses packing the music center plaza cheered as walls of 
water rose up on either side of the plazas central sculpture 
it worked heston said 
the birthday celebration was held exactly 25 years after the 
dorothy chandler pavilion opened on dec 6 1964 with zubin mehta 
conducting the los angeles philharmonic and jascha heifetz as the 
soloist 
the 34 million center was completed in april 1967 with openings 
of the mark taper forum and the ahmanson theatre giving a home to 
performing arts in a city maligned by denizens of colder climes as 
a cultural wasteland 
the sevenacre center was built at the civic center with 20 
million in private donations raised by dorothy buffum chandler and 
145 million covered by a lease agreement with los angeles county 
in contrast to the formal opening night years earlier the 
throng of noon revelers feasted on birthday cake and drank cartons 
of milk under a brilliant 80degree sky that heston in moses tone 
took credit for 
the round mark taper forum was dressed like a birthday cake 
complete with red candles sticking out of the roof visitors took 
tours and the mark taper offered a free performance of truman 
capotes a christmas memory 
the high school bands led by a unit of the university of 
southern california band played the title song from the phantom 
of the opera and seventy six trombones from the music man 
actress carol channing introduced to the strains of diamonds 
are a girls best friend presented her diamond awards to 
peter schabarum president of the county board of supervisors and 
gordon davidson artistic director of the center theatre group at 
the mark taper 
all good work is rewarded with diamonds said miss channing 
she recalled how she and the company of hello dolly broke 
its original broadway engagement to perform at the new dorothy 
chandler pavilion 
it was one of the thrills of our lives she said 
the story triggered a memory for carolyn allen a 10year music 
center employee in the crowd who had gone to that engagement of 
hello dolly 
i stood eight hours in line for a ticket then i sat on the 
very top row of the balcony she said expressing disbelief it 
had been so long ago 
construction began on the elegant 3197seat dorothy chandler 
pavilion in march 1962 and was finished 2 years later 
the 742seat mark taper opened on april 9 1967 with the 
devils starring frank langella and ed flanders the 2071seat 
ahmanson opened three days later with ingrid bergman arthur hill 
and colleen dewhurst in more stately mansions 
in addition to the philharmonic and center theater group which 
develops experimental works at the taper and classical dramas and 
comedies at the ahmanson other companies are the music center 
opera joffrey ballet lany los angeles master chorale and the 
music center education division

the national commission on aids said the 
nations health care system needs urgent repair to deal with the 
crisis and underscored that point wednesday by sending its report 
to the white house eight months early 
a series of problems have resulted in a health care system 
singularly unresponsive to the needs of hiv infected people the 
commission said in its report to president bush 
the commission said that because infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv appeared initially in groups 
often shunned by the larger society including homosexuals the 
poor minorities and intravenous drug users the national response 
to the aids epidemic has been slow 
the commission cited a lack of training support for primary care 
physicians to treat people with hiv infection and aids and 
financial disincentives for physicians to treat medicaid and other 
poor patients 
the commission believes it is time to match rhetoric with 
action said the report by the panel created by congress to 
advise the president and capitol hill on aids issues 
dr louis sullivan who as secretary of the department of health 
and human services sits as a nonvoting member of the commission 
did not participate in writing the report and a spokesman for 
sullivan took issue with the reports criticism of national 
leadership it says is lacking 
spokesman jim brown said sullivan has expressed concern about 
some of the same issues addressed by the commissions report 
however brown said there has been leadership from this 
department and there will continue to be 
brown cited among the departments aids activities education 
programs drug research at the national institutes of health and 
federal funding under medicaid to treat people with aids 
but the report said more needs to be done 
it is essential that everyone be afforded early intervention 
and access to care the report said 
the report estimated that direct medical care for people with 
aids in 1991 will cost from 25 billion to 151 billion it notes 
the range is from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of total 
health care spending in the nation and adds we simply must be 
prepared to make these expenditures 
dr david rogers vice chairman of the commission said these 
costs are affordable i think weve done a disservice to say 
these are astronomical costs and that we cant handle them of 
course we can he said 
the commission was required to draft its first annual report by 
august 1990 but in a letter to president bush accompanying the 
report commissioners said testimony they heard at their public 
hearings was so compelling we felt it is vital to write to you 
now copies of the report were also given to leaders of the house 
and senate 
federal health officials say 112241 cases of aids have been 
reported in the united states since june 1981 and 66493 of them 
have died 
more than 1 million americans are believed to be infected with 
hiv now and the commission said that over the next four years 
aids is likely to claim 200000 lives 
the hiv epidemic is not just a new york city or a san 
francisco problem as some would like to believe the report said 
though those cities continue to have a heavy load of aids cases 
by 1991 experts estimate that 80 percent of new aids cases will 
come from outside those two cities the report said 
the epidemic is infecting a disproportionate number of blacks 
and hispanics and is expected to take an increasing toll on women 
and children in coming years the report said 
while new drug treatments can prolong the lives of people with 
hiv infection and aids scientific breakthroughs mean little 
unless the health care system can incorporate them and make them 
accessible to people in need 
the commission cited a 1987 survey that showed nearly one 
quarter of all aids patients have no form of insurance private or 
public 
additionally those on medicaid run into barriers because low 
reimbursement rates are a disincentive for physicians to treat 
medicaid patients the report said 
for example a new patient intermediate office visit in new 
york city is compensated by blue cross at 78 by medicare at 80 
and by medicaid at 7 the report said 
whats needed the commission said is frank recognition that 
a crisis exists in many cities that will require extraordinary 
measures to overcome 
the panel recommended creation of a flexible patientoriented 
comprehensive system of care closely linking hospital ambulatory 
residential and home care 
the report also says the administration should consider creating 
regional centers to provide backup and consultation to primary 
care physicians treating aids patients 
it also calls for creation of units for treatment of hiv 
patients who are also drug addicts commission members also 
expressed surprise and disappointment that the white house 
national drug control strategy gives little attention to the 
problem of aids spread by iv drug users sharing needles

of buildings for rescue workers to find their relatives in the 
rubble 
one man stood crying beside a heap of bent metal while firehoses 
hissed and smoke climbed into the air he was beside what was left

several highrise buildings in the financial district of this 
capital and should be out of the area by late morning they were to 
be taken to the philippine armys headquarters at fort bonafacio

defense minister yitzhak rabin described as a 
great step forward on wednesday the acceptance by egypt of a 
middle east peace plan offered by us secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
rabin said baker and the foreign ministers of israel and egypt 
should meet quickly to determine the composition of a palestinian 
delegation for peace talks with israel and the agenda of such talks 
i bless it i see the positive egyptian response as a 
great step forward toward the implementation of the israeli peace 
plan rabin said speaking on israel television 
the state department announced wednesday it had received a 
positive response from egypt department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler raised the possibility of a trilateral meeting in 
washington early next year to work on details 
we will be working with the parties on steps needed to get to 
a trilateral meeting in washington as part of the process for 
launching an israelipalestinian dialogue she said 
bakers framework calls for a preliminary dialogue in cairo 
egypt between delegations of israel and the palestinians so as to 
advance the israelioffered plan of elections in the occupied west 
bank and the gaza strip 
in other middle east developments wednesday 
kurt waldheim president of austria and former 
secretarygeneral of the united nations ended a threeday official 
visit to tunisia after brief talks with plo chairman yasser arafat 
on the prospects for peace in the middle east arafats palestine 
liberation organization is headquartered in tunis 
president hafez assad repeated syrias support for a 
unsponsored arabisraeli peace conference despite us and 
israeli efforts to arrange more limited negotiations his comments 
came in a meeting in damascus with former us secretary of state 
cyrus vance and former undersecretary richard murphy who are on a 
study tour of the region 
rabin of the leftleaning labor party said of egypts 
acceptance the moment egypt in addition to israel gave a 
positive reply there is no obstacle and we should not examine 
their response as we wont agree to them examining our peace 
initiative 
the moment the answer is positive in principle we should move 
forward toward the meeting of three ministers who should determine 
the composition of the palestinian delegation and what will be on 
the agenda 
his comments contradicted an earlier statement by foreign 
ministry spokesman yosef amihud who said israel first wanted to 
see a written version of the egyptian response to examine it 
the discrepancy could be explained by ideological differences 
between labor and the hardline likud bloc of foreign minister 
moshe arens and prime minister yitzhak shamir 
labor favors a territorial compromise with the palestinians and 
is ready to offer concessions likud views the occupied lands as an 
integral part of israel 
rabin contrary to likuds stand indicated he did not oppose an 
indirect plo role in the process saying 
today there are three partners to the move egypt israel and 
the united states whomever one of them talks to its their 
business 
rabin expressed hope likud would not torpedo the negotiations 
many problems remained unresolved even after egypts acceptance 
of bakers peace framework 
ms tutwiler indicated that egypt specified some conditions as 
israel had done earlier she said that in their responses both 
egypt and israel have conveyed certain views and positions on this 
process 
israel accepted the baker plan but sought us guarantees the 
plo viewed by israel as a terrorist group would play no role in 
the peace process 
it also wants the agenda limited to israels elections proposal 
which says negotiations would be held with elected representatives 
on limited autonomy for 17 million palestinians in the occupied 
territories 
the plo wants a broader agenda so palestinian demands for 
independent statehood can be raised it also wants to take part in 
selecting the palestinian delegation for the dialogue with israel 
and the egyptian response also apparently contained such a 
condition

philippine president corazon aquinos ability 
to survive politically is in doubt and may depend on how seriously 
she takes the lessons of the coup attempt against her a senior 
bush administration official said wednesday 
shes been hurt theres no question about it said the 
official who briefed a small group of reporters on the condition 
he not be named 
it was the first time since the military rebellion began friday 
that the bush administration had voiced concerns about the mutinys 
longterm effects on aquinos future 
the official spoke a little more than an hour before news came 
from manila that rebel troops holding a downtown district had 
agreed to return to their barracks 
the administration official in an apparent attempt to send a 
clear signal to aquino said the united states must now reassess 
what all this means in terms of us assistance to her government 
he did not elaborate 
but the official called the insurrection a serious attempt 
to topple mrs aquino and said she should regard it as such 
he called on mrs aquino to seek to eliminate the sources of 
discontent which helped lead to the coup as she struggles to 
reassert control 
asked if aquino could survive politically if she succeeds 
militarily in putting down the rebel forces the official said 
thats a tough one 
there has been a lot of criticism of her from the army for 
not giving military leaders more of a free hand in cracking down on 
the leftist new peoples army and for ignoring the military 
the official said 
i dont know if its justified or not it is what they 
believe he went on adding that the criticism is a symptom of 
feelings and as a political leader she has to deal with it 
it is elements of aquinos own army that are rebelling against 
her now the us official noted that the restiveness in the 
military gave col gregorio honasan a leader of the coup attempt 
far more support over the last week than he had when he led a 
previous effort to oust mrs aquino 
earlier us officials praised as careful and effective a 
philippine evacuation that freed 280 americans and other foreigners 
from the manila hotels where they had been trapped by gunfire in 
the sixdayold rebellion 
we commend the aquino government for organizing and carrying 
out this operation said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler applauding the careful and effective manner in which it 
dealt with the situation in the makati commercial district and the 
efforts it took to safeguard american citizens and others who were 
in the area 
the evacuation followed negotiations between the aquino 
government and the rebels into the early hours of wednesday to 
reach a ceasefire she said but declined to comment on restraint 
shown by the rebels us officials had no contact with the rebels 
she said 
its unfortunate that the rebels caused this situation ms 
tutwiler said we are obviously not going to get out here in a 
position and applaud the rebels we are applauding the aquino 
government 
all those trapped in the hotel district were freed without 
injury she said and were taken by bus to processing centers set 
up by the us embassy to help them contact relatives and make 
lodging and travel plans 
while the situation has improved we continue to urge american 
citizens to exercise caution ms tutwiler said 
aquinos declaration of a state of national emergency was 
totally legally what she has done under their constitution 
ms tutwiler said declining further comment on the philippine 
governments response to the weekold rebellion 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater also declined 
comment on the emergency declaration other than to say we will 
take a look at it and see if we have any concerns 
some 2000 foreigners had been trapped for four days in hotels 
by the military coup attempt that had left at least 79 dead and 570 
wounded since friday

one of three men who commandeered 
a school bus and held the driver and 26 children underground in a 
5 million ransom plot was denied parole wednesday for the sixth 
time 
the california board of prison terms refused james schoenfelds 
latest bid for freedom after a 2hour hearing at the prison where 
he is serving a life sentence in the 1976 kidnapping 
the denial was based on schoenfields crime which was carried 
out in an especially heinous atrocious cruel and callous manner 
which exhibits a disregard for the life or suffering of another 
said phyllis scott a spokeswoman for the threemember board 
schoenfeld 37 who was sentenced in 1978 will be eligible for 
parole again in december 1990 ms scott said 
schoenfeld his brother richard and frederick woods were 
convicted of the july 15 1976 abduction of the chowchilla school 
bus driver and 26 children headed home from summer school the 
children ranged in age from 5 to 14 
the kidnappers placed the youngsters and bus driver in a moving 
van buried at a rock quarry near livermore almost 100 miles west 
of chowchilla which is 240 miles northwest of los angeles 
the prisoner and crime partners kidnapped at shotgun point 26 
youngsters and their school bus driver and transported them 100 
miles away to a buried van ms scott said 
the youngsters and driver escaped after 17 hours in the 
sweltering van 28 hours after their abduction the van was 
equipped with a single air vent to allow the group to breath 
underground 
the schoenfeld brothers and woods were members of prominent san 
francisco peninsula families and said in presentencing reports 
that they planned to seek 5 million ransom 
they were thwarted in telephoning their ransom demands to 
authorities in chowchilla because the telephone lines were tied up 
constantly by law enforcement officials and reporters the day after 
the kidnapping 
the board also denied parole based on a psychological evaluation 
of schoenfeld in september ms scott said she would not provide 
details of the evaluation 
during the hearing the panel commended schoenfeld for his good 
behavior and his excellent work record as a vocational drafting 
clerk ms scott said 
richard schoenfeld and woods also received life terms and have 
been denied parole periodically

tuesday and wednesday killing dozens of soldiers and opening the 
way for an attack on a military operations center

guerrilla victory over the vietnameseinstalled government since 
communist khmer rouge rebels seized the rich gemmining town of 
pailin further south on oct 22 
the guerrillas said they captured svay chek on tuesday night and 
treas on wednesday morning the towns in northwestern battambang 
province lie along route 69 leading to the military operations 
center at sisophon 16 miles south of svay chek

khmer rouge and the liberation front 
about 3000 liberation front guerrillas attacked svay chek said 
gen dien del deputy commander of the fronts army he said many 
government soldiers died and that six to seven guerrillas were 
killed and 30 wounded 
we captured more than 1000 weapons we have been trying for 
more than a month to take svay chek this is a big victory for 
us said dien del reached by telephone at the thai border town 
of aranyaprathet 
on nov 27 government forces repulsed the guerrillas from 
positions around svay chek seized by the government the day before 
the official state radio said 50 guerrillas died in that attack

bordering thailand since late september when vietnam said it 
withdrew the last of its troops the guerrillas say they want to 
force the government back to peace talks with more flexibility on 
the issue of sharing power with the guerrillas

federal officials delayed closing a 
troubled colorado savings and loan largely because president bushs 
son was on its board a former federal bank regulator charged in a 
published report wednesday 
neil bushs presence was a material part of unconscionable 
delays in taking over silverado james moroney told the san 
francisco chronicle 
moroney is a former staff analyst for the topeka federal home 
loan bank which supervised silverado savings and loan of denver 
the head of the topeka bank at the time denied that neil bushs 
presence was an influence 
the economic substance of silverados loan portfolio was 
comparable to a ponzi scheme a type of pyramid investment fraud 
and it couldnt have worked out said moroney 42 a kansas city 
lawyer who left the topeka bank after six months in 1986 
it was insolvent back in 1986 it was not a judgment call 
that place clearly was very insolvent moroney said 
neil bush resigned from silverados board just after his father 
won the republican nomination in 1988 and only four months before 
the sampls seizure 
the chronicle also reported that documents it obtained show top 
federal regulators knew the thrifts financial situation was bad 
enough to mandate restrictions on investments and insider deals at 
least 14 months before it was closed dec 9 1988 
moroney said he believes a big reason his district superiors 
including former topeka bank president kermit mowbray allowed 
silverado to continue was their knowledge that neil bush and 
republican party fund raiser larry mizel of mdc holdings were 
involved with the institution 
mowbray who retired the month that silverado closed denied 
moroneys allegations tuesday saying neil bush being on that 
board had no effect on our decisions mowbray who said he never 
met bush also denied knowing that silverado was insolvent in 1986 
in 1986 moroney said he approached a fellow supervisor and 
asked why are we putting up with this silverado we would not 
permit that type of loan workout for another institution 
and he looked at me and said well you know who one of the 
directors is and i said no and he said the vice presidents 
son neil bush moroney told the chronicle 
however he said he has no evidence that either bush or mizel 
exerted direct pressure for the preferential treatment they 
got he said their presence was enough to cause mowbray to take 
an extraordinary interest in silverado and to proceed cautiously in 
the case 
bush reached by telephone at his office in denver said im 
going to cooperate in any way im asked to it would be 
inappropriate for me to get into any details except with 
authorities investigating silverado 
in a news conference wednesday in washington dc president 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater was asked whether the president 
was concerned that silverados collapse might have have been partly 
due to regulators who were fearful of neil bushs role 
fitzwater replied these matters are all under investigation 
and consideration and we wont offer any comment on any aspect of 
it i might say neils been off that board for a long time 
president bush is scheduled to visit denver on friday

the military issued its first warning 
wednesday in the turmoil that has convulsed east germany and a 
noncommunist took over as head of state to end a 40year lock the 
communists held on the presidency 
the government reported signs that angry citizens were storming 
army installations and military leaders pledged to repel any 
attempts to seize weapons and munitions 
manfred gerlach leader of the liberal democratic party 
replaced egon krenz as interim president the first time a 
noncommunist had become president since east germanys founding in 
1949 gerlachs party recently broke off its long alliance with the 
communists after weeks of spearheading reforms 
the communists advanced their emergency session one week to 
friday to overhaul the partys structure 
shedding such stalinist operations as the central committee 
and ruling politburo is one possibility breaking up the party is 
another 
in seven weeks the country has faced a virtual revolution that 
first ousted a hardline leadership and then threw out senior 
communist party chiefs a 25member committee of communists now 
runs the nation 
the national defense council in charge of the armed forces 
quit on wednesday less than 24 hours after the leadership of the 
oncedreaded secret police quit 
the official adn news agency reported late wednesday the suicide 
of an official caught two days earlier trying to leave a government 
building with two suitcases stuffed with east german and west 
german money 
adn did not give his name but said he was connected to the case 
of fugitive alexander schalckgolodkowski the former top east 
german foreign trade official accused of running a weaponsselling 
ring 
early thursday west berlin police spokesman helmut hinz 
announced schalckgolodkowski was in a west berlin prison after an 
international manhunt adn said he had turned himself in to 
authorities late wednesday but did not elaborate 
west germanys zdf television network reported 
schalckgolodkowski planned to pay back 31 million to the east 
german government from swiss bank accounts he is suspected of 
having smuggled several times that amount from the country 
according to reports on east germanys state television 
manfred seidel the no 2 official in that scandalplagued 
office was arrested on suspicion of having smuggled 110 million 
out of the country 
the christian democrats a small party that recently broke with 
the communists said growing financial scandals were making east 
germany look like a banana republic 
the government announced a partial amnesty wednesday following 
hunger strikes spreading to penal institutions nationwide it 
applies to those sentenced to three years or less and excludes 
prisoners convicted of rowdiness a term once applied to 
prodemocracy demonstrators but also sometimes used for more 
serious offenders 
the reform movement exploded here after hardliner erich 
honecker was ousted following 18 years as communist party chief 
since then a popular uprising and a flood of refugees to the west 
forced the government to open east germanys borders and the berlin 
wall to let citizens travel freely 
east germans also have been promised open elections but the 
countrys overall direction remains unclear 
prodemocracy opposition groups so far lack the coordination to 
fill the power vaccum left by the communists hasty retreat 
for days reports surfaced of furious citizens barging into 
secret police offices including storming one building in the 
southern city of gera on wednesday 
a citizens committee pressing for reforms in leipzig occupied 
regional state security headquarters there on monday and an adn 
report suggested the activists still controlled the building 
the assaults were meant to stop destruction of documents needed 
in prosecuting former communist officials 
an investigative commission recommended criminal charges against 
former secret police boss erich mielke 81 for police attacks 
against demonstrators in october that touched off the revolutionary 
changes 
the government headed by reformist premier hans modrow said 
late wednesday indications emerged that people were storming 
army installations 
no details were given but the government appealed for calm 
and restraint 
the national peoples army leadership issued its own statement 
addressed to both soldiers and citizens saying such intrusions 
could cause danger for the security of the german democratic 
republic 
illegal entry to weapons munitions and fuel will be blocked 
military leaders expressed concern for securing peace and 
pledged to work with soviet and warsaw pact forces to secure peace 
in central europe 
only together can we preserve the sovereignty of the german 
democratic republic and protect our country from anarchy and 
chaos they said 
the governments appeal for calm was the top item on east 
germanys main tv news program which said lutheran church leaders 
joined the call 
the program said the church has information making it 
increasingly concerned about calls for revenge that the search 
for the guilty has frightened many people 
in resigning krenz warned of antisocialistic forces 
filling the nation and called for a joint effort to repel them 
in this hour of greatest danger all those who love this 
country must stand together out of patriotic duty 
krenz quit as communist party chief on sunday 
opposition leaders and members of his own party said he was too 
tainted by scandals of the honecker era to guide the nation out of 
its economic and political crisis 
gerlach looking somber announced his appointment on tv saying 
he was not glad about taking on the duties 
he will serve as president until parliament picks a permanent 
replacement speculation grew that another noncommunist would take 
over permanently although gerlach ruled himself out 
the presidency is a largely ceremonial but highly visible post 
the president routinely represents the country on foreign trips

leftist guerrillas on wednesday 
released an american helicopter mechanic they had held prisoner 
with his thumbs tied behind his back for 22 hours the us embassy 
confirmed 
rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front or 
fmln had reported on their clandestine radio what they described 
as the brief detention of a us citizen the insurgents identified 
the man as jack cooper and said he was a us military adviser 
embassy spokesman jeff brown said the mans surname is not 
cooper but declined to identify him citing the privacy act he 
also said the man is not an adviser describing him as a civilian 
helicopter mechanic under contract to the 55 us military advisers 
based in el salvador 
the rebels said on radio venceremos they detained the american 
late tuesday at a guerrilla roadblock on the capitals western 
edge in the affluent escalon neighborhood 
escalon has been the scene of sustained combat twice since nov 
11 when the insurgents launched their largest offensive of the 
10yearold civil war both times after invading the neighborhood 
for several hours they retreated up the san salvador volcano that 
looms over the capitals northwestern sector 
the guerrillas said the man and a salvadoran woman companion 
were briefly questioned and released 
brown said the man was indeed detained in upper escalon but was 
held from 730 pm tuesday until 6 am wednesday he said the 
mans car was stolen and he was forced to stand for several 
hours his thumbs were tied behind his back while he was held he 
said 
the rebels have reiterated repeatedly in recent months they do 
not consider nonmilitary us personnel objectives in their war 
against the government guerrillas occupied the houses of several 
american families last week during an incursion into escalon but 
called a truce to permit their evacuation

manfred gerlach quickly took up the call for 
reforms as the oncemonolithic east german power structure began to 
crumble in october 
on wednesday the liberal democratic party chief became the 
countrys first noncommunist president 
in the anything goes world of east german politics the 
61yearold gerlach was able to maneuver himself out from the 
communists shadow into national prominence 
the communists for decades counted four smaller parties as their 
allies among them gerlachs liberal democrats the national 
front that bound them together routinely picked up more than 99 
percent of the vote in governmentcontrolled elections 
the system gave the country at least an outward semblance of 
democracy despite the hardline leadership in reality the 
communist party ran the show and no one challenged it 
that all changed on oct 7 as party chief erich honecker faced 
huge street protests and heard a stern warning from visiting soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev that he who is late is punished 
less than two weeks later the 77yearold honecker was out and 
his protege egon krenz was in this time with a vague promise of 
free elections 
gerlach a grayhaired professoriallooking lawyer quickly 
took up the cause of free elections and other causes as well he 
demanded an end to communist monopoly on power and greater openness 
in society he insisted that officials look into why tens of 
thousands of people were fleeing the country 
the three other parties farmers party national democrats and 
christian democrats quickly joined in the calls for reform but 
by then gerlach was well out in front 
that seeming overnight conversion isnt without its detractors 
the four parties are acting as if they were seduced virgins 
who are now trying to run away from the big bad communist party 
opposition leader rainer eppellmann said last month 
still gerlachs composure and outspokenness won him supporters 
as he appealed for greater tolerance and denounced antisemitism 
gerlach told parliament on nov 17 that his party was breaking 
from the communist alliance and called for a true sharing of 
power in free voting 
but he also made it clear in a television interview that we 
are a party socialists in a socialist system 
the task before us now is to define what socialism means and 
how we can make it meet the needs of the people 
the insiderturnedoutsider saw his main wish come true last 
friday when the communistdominated parliament scrapped the partys 
leading role in society 
even within the fastforward pace of change in east europe that 
was record time with the results due in part to gerlach 
it has paid off a public opinion poll conducted in east germany 
for west germanys stern magazine says the liberal democrats would 
reach second place behind the huge and sometimes unwieldy new 
forum movement if free elections were held today 
the communists would be third the poll said 
despite the success a somber gerlach said he was not happy 
about taking on the new duties as head of state 
gerlach indicated he wouldnt actively seek to hold on to the 
job when the parliament fills the presidency on a permanent basis 
but it seemed certain that the equivalent of a draft would keep 
him on as president 
while the jobs powers are limited the east german president 
does represent the country on foreign visits gerlachs stature and 
demeanor are probably just whats needed abroad for a country that 
his allies the christian democrats say is reaching banana 
republic stage 
gerlach had already been serving as the countrys vice 
president before wednesdays vote a liberal democrat since the 
end of the war gerlach also served as mayor of leipzig in the 
1950s 
in addition to gerlach the parliament also has a noncommunist 
chief farmers party chief guenther maleuda was elected speaker on 
nov 13

nationalistic fervor whipped up by 
the government is turning the title fight thursday between sugar 
ray leonard and roberto duran into a symbolic political clash 
the fight comes at a low point in panamaunited states 
relations with the us government continuing economic sanctions 
in a bid to force the ouster of gen manuel antonio noriega the 
head of panamas defense forces and de facto leader a coup that 
began with us support was botched in october 
for panama i am going to beat that loudmouth duran said in 
a television advertisment in which he also asks fans to be smart 
and bet on me 
this capital city is expected to come to a standstill thursday 
night during the live television broadcast of the fight giant 
screens are being put up in lowincome neighborhoods to make it 
easier for fans to watch and cheer duran 
a radio announcer warned tuesday that the defense forces should 
be alert because it would be the best time for an invasion by us 
forces 
but many of the nearly 12000 soldiers on us bases in panama 
also will be watching the fight 
you can imagine whom ill be rooting for a us army 
officer said leonard 
the fight at las vegas has joined government officials and 
opposition leaders in wishing that the durable duran known as 
mano de piedra or hands of stone wins his fifth world 
crown 
a popular novelty item is a baseball hat with durans name and 
four embroidered crowns 
i am going to put the fifth one here a fan told a 
television interviewer pointing to the center of his hat 
the nationalistic fever was boosted this week by duran when he 
called sports officials to say that us officials had forbidden the 
singing of the panamanian national anthem before the fight 
sanctions forbid us companies to deal commercially with 
people companies or agencies associated with noriega so 
broadcasting rights became a controversial issue 
a promoter not on the us blacklist obtained the rights to the 
leonardduran bout but us officials told the company not to 
relay it to the government station the government station wanted 
to make a deal but the promoters were afraid of upsetting the us 
government and being added to the list associated with noriega 
spokesmen for the government station refused to say if it 
planned a delayed transmission 
it is a pity because this is a country with knowledgeable 
boxing fans said sports promoter edmundo vargas 
however the promotion company gave up its rights and the us 
company top rank dealt directly with a private television channel 
that will broadcast to panama city and colon about 50 miles to the 
north 
last week panamanians also got around us restrictions by 
sending a horse coowned by a noriega friend to puerto rico where 
it won the caribbean classic 
there are no visa restrictions for horses a foreign 
diplomat said and although everybody here knows who owns the 
horse apparently they sent it there as if it were owned by 
somebody else 
newspapers portrayed the victory of the panamanian horse as a 
win over the united states

roman catholic assemblywoman lucy killea was narrowly elected to 
californias senate because the church made a martyr out of the 
democrat by denying her communion for supporting abortion rights 
her gop opponent said wednesday 
killea disputed assemblywoman carol bentleys analysis of 
tuesdays special election saying her stance hurt her as much as 
it helped 
in north dakota gov george sinner proposed 98 million in 
spending cuts after voters tuesday rejected three proposed tax 
increases two of which had already gone into effect after approval 
by the legislature 
five other referendums including one requiring seat belt use 
and another mandating a statewide sex education curriculum and a 
proposed constitutional amendment were also defeated 
people were in the mood to vote no and once they started 
voting no they just kept going said state rep tish kelly of 
fargo 
in northern california a fouryear legal battle to boost 
hispanic representation on watsonsvilles city council ended with 
hispanics losing three of four seats theyd sought under a new 
election system seven seats had been up for grabs 
killeas margin over bentley in the san diego county election 
was razor thin she got 61860 ballots or 5097 percent of the 
vote to 59496 for bentley or 4903 
bentley a freshman from la mesa said at a news conference that 
bishop leo maher had no choice but to deny holy communion to 
killea three weeks ago making her the first us elected official 
to be so sanctioned 
but bentley added the bishops action created an 
international celebrity and martyr 
i dont see that killea said at her postelection news 
conference we got an awful lot of people who opposed me because 
of the bishops decision i think it worked both ways i dont 
think well ever know 
maher reiterated his displeasure with killea saying he made an 
example of her because she had the responsibility as a roman 
catholic elected official to follow church teachings in the public 
arena 
it is to be noted that no popular vote or public opinion can 
change in any way the divine law that directs and guides 
humankind maher said in a statement 
killea replaces an incumbent who resigned to become a municipal 
judge 
in north dakota 253439 people or 53 percent of those 
eligible cast ballots the seven referendums were the most on a 
ballot since 1919 
about 60 percent of the voters rejected proposed increases in 
income and motor fuel taxes and a proposed raise in the sales tax 
lost 53 percent to 47 percent 
i am very disappointed obviously in the outcome sinner 
said in proposing 34 million in cuts for elementary and secondary 
education 24 million for higher education and 21 million for 
social services 
some attributed the defeat to years of drought and a decade of 
economic hardship north dakota people are short of money and 
hurting said state sen geraldine meyer 
the state tax department told merchants to immediately lower the 
sales tax from 6 percent to 5 percent state income taxes dropped 
from 17 percent to 14 percent of a federal tax bill the gastax 
hike never took effect 
in addition to the seat belt and sex education referendums 
voters rejected proposals to legalize video gambling and put state 
lawmakers in the public employee retirement system 
the defeated constitutional amendment would have limited the 
number of state agencies under the governors control to 14 more 
than 100 now fall under gubernatorial jurisdiction 
watsonvilles courtordered election was the first under a 
districtvote system council candidates previously were elected at 
large 
the election was originally scheduled for nov 7 but was 
postponed after the oct 17 earthquake which demolished more than 
300 homes in the farming community 95 miles south of san francisco 
one hispanic candidate blamed her defeat on the disaster we 
just didnt have the money or whatever it took to beat an 
earthquake community organizer cruz gomez said at a glum 
postelection gathering 
the only hispanic to win a seat on the council was oscar rios 
the charismatic leader of a 19month cannery strike

trustees for further study before the the next annual meeting in 
june 1990

when a pregnant woman refuses medical treatment that would benefit 
the health of her fetus

rebel troops gave up their stronghold 
in the makati business district thursday and returned to their 
barracks seven days after launching a coup attempt against 
president corazon aquino 
this is unconditional surrender said brig gen arturo 
enrile head of the philippine military academy who led 
negotiations throughout the night with rebel leaders the problem 
is already finished 
however rebels who marched the 1 miles back to nearby fort 
bonifacio were smiling chanting no surrender the fight goes 
on soldiers at the army base there unfurled a white sheet at the 
gate saying welcome home 
rebels still held mactan air base in cebu 350 miles south of 
manila however local officials thursday were trying to arrange 
talks there to end the occupation at the last known rebel 
stronghold 
at least 79 people have been killed and more than 570 others 
wounded since the coup began friday 
mrs aquino who faced the gravest crisis of her 3yearold 
administration expressed relief that the siege was over 
i would also like to commend those who helped to bring about 
this end to urban terrorism she said in a written statement 
we must now all join hands and consolidate our resources to 
rebuild what has been destroyed 
thursdays announcement came one day after 1800 foreigners 
including about 250 americans were evacuated from rebelheld 
luxury hotels in makati and mrs aquino declared a national state 
of emergency 
as the rebels left the skyscrapers and hotels seized last 
saturday the atmosphere seemed more one of victory than defeat 
the mutineers rifles bazookas machine guns and bandoleers of 
ammunition slung over their shoulders sang the theme song of their 
scout ranger unit as they marched to fort bonifacio 
we have won some victories said rebel capt danilo lim 
we have made a very strong statement as the mutineers marched 
past the exclusive forbes park neighborhood where us ambassador 
nicholas platt lives some residents stood on the street and 
cheered 
i would like to say that the soldiers are voluntarily 
returning to barracks lim told reporters as he left makati we 
did not surrender 
rebel spokesman capt albert yen said we are willing to face 
the consequences of our acts but the fight must go on 
scout ranger cpl roy bantung another mutineer said we will 
not surrender even if it takes forever the government must 
change cory must change her policies he was using president 
aquinos nickname 
the government agreed the rebels will be treated humanely 
justly and fairly enrile said but he added they would suffer 
the consequences for launching the sixth coup attempt against 
mrs aquino since she came to power in february 1986 
he did not elaborate most rebel officers in past coup attempts 
have simply been confined to barracks and many enlisted men were 
sent back into the ranks some rebels have been charged but been 
acquitted or given light sentences 
rebels agreed about midnight to give up enrile said we all 
agreed that if they returned to the barracks it would be good 
for the nation as a whole 
he added that the rebels political demands which included the 
resignation of mrs aquino were nonnegotiable 
the rebels seized hotels and buildings in the financial area 
saturday on the second day of their coup attempt 
on friday us f4 phantom jets flw air cover for loyalist 
forces without firing on the rebels and prevented insurgents from 
continuing air strikes from villamor air base they had seized the 
base in the first hours of the coup 
rebel leaders said the uprising was codenamed seven days and 
seven nights in december and would involve a sevenstage 
operation the leaders said the takeover of the financial district 
was the second stage 
president aquino early wednesday evoked the people power 
revolution in appealing for support against mutinous soldiers bent 
on overthrowing her government 
i am telling you now that i have put so much at stake for 
democracy i have lost my husband mrs aquino said in a 
nationally televised address appearing tired 
why did i become president it was because you believed in me 
and in spite of all of the coup attempts you have stuck by me 
against enemies who want to kill me so that they can rule our 
land she said 
mrs aquinos husband benigno aquino jr was slain in 1983 as 
he arrived from selfimposed exile in the united states to 
challenge president ferdinand e marcos she took his place as the 
opposition presidential candidate and was swept into office by a 
popular uprising marcos went into exile in hawaii 
after her speech wednesday the government announced that mrs 
aquino had proclaimed a national state of emergency giving her 
broad powers to cope with the rebellion launched friday by 
thousands of soldiers 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
evacuation was managed without incident and all americans were 
reported safe and we have no reports of injuries 
after the evacuation rebel and army representatives began talks 
on ending the rebellion sporadic sniping resumed but the 
ceasefire generally held through the day 
it was unclear what new powers mrs aquino would have cabinet 
officials insisted personal liberties would not be curtailed but 
said special powers were needed to deal with the economic and 
social crisis caused by the coup 
public confidence has been shaken far more than by any of the 
five other coup attempts 
jose fernandez governor of the central bank said wednesday two 
billion pesos 91 million had been withdrawn in runs on manila 
banks the past two days and many parts of the archipelago had cash 
shortages because domestic air service had been suspended 
labor secretary franklin drilon said this is not martial law 
theres no curfew theres no suspension of the writ of habeas 
corpus congress will continue we will continue to enjoy our 
rights it only empowers government to check those who may not be 
delivering basic services 
rep salvador britannico an opposition legislator said the 
emergency declaration would discourage foreign investment and was 
a first step toward the declaration of martial law 
adolfo azcuna the government press secretary said officials 
planned to take control of utilities and transport josephina 
lichaoco chairman of the national telecommunications commission 
said new media guidelines would be issued 
among other things she said they would forbid the broadcast of 
rebellious terrorist propaganda comments and interviews and 
strategic information such as troop movements weapons and 
numbers of soldiers 
in her television address mrs aquino urged filipinos to fill 
the streets friday in the same demonstration of people power 
that forced the late president marcos into exile 
it is very clear that these people want to kill me to 
eliminate me so that they can rule our land she said 
what they have forgotten is power is not theirs to take they 
cannot just grab power by killing people they have to understand 
power belongs to you my beloved countrymen 
the rebels have demanded mrs aquino resign in favor of a 
coalition that would hold a referendum on a new government they 
accuse her of ignoring corruption refusing to make social and 
economic reform and failing to crush the communist insurgency that 
began a generation ago under marcos

japans defense budget already judged the 
thirdlargest in the world will continue to grow even as the 
superpowers talk about cutting back on military spending officials 
say 
in a region so far immune to dramatic improvements in relations 
like those occurring in europe japan has at best cool relations 
with the soviet union as the two countries are deadlocked over an 
old territorial dispute and the united states is pressing tokyo to 
increase its budgetary support for us forces based in japan 
japans military budget always controversial in light of a 
constitution that bans war has grown steadily through the 1980s to 
increase the countrys ability to fend off soviet attack 
it is separate from superpower arms reductions from that 
point of view so our own efforts for improving our selfdefense 
are not expected to change at the moment foreign ministry 
spokesman taizo watanabe told a news conference tuesday

businesses this year with numerous layoffs and other job 
reductions while sales continue to rise the singledigit growth 
is a comedown for an industry that was accustomed to bounding gains 
early in the decade 
the latest evidence came tuesday when international business

would cut 10000 us jobs without layoffs because of slow growth 
in its home market

delta burke whose weight gain has sent the 
rumor mill and the tabloid press into a frenzy deals forthrightly 
with the issue in an episode of cbs designing women on monday 
her gain of about 30 pounds in the past two years has unleashed 
a fury of phony reports that she has been suspended from the show 
that shes causing trouble on the set and that her sixmonthold 
marriage to major dad star gerald mcraney is on the rocks 
in mondays episode her character suzanne sugarbaker has to 
face the fact that shes gotten fat when she is ridiculed at her 
high school reunion 
when all this started i was very hurt said burke i 
didnt do anything to deserve this why are they so cruel i went 
through a lot of emotions with this you give yourself pep talks 
elizabeth taylor had to put up with this every star whos gained 
weight has had to put up with this 
burke who is 33 and 5foot5 declines to say what her weight 
is its nowhere near the 200 pounds they say it is she said 
elizabeth taylor was pilloried for getting fat she finally went 
on a wellpublicized diet and wrote a book about it oprah winfrey 
went public with her diet on her talk show oprah 
winfrey lost 67 pounds and vowed she would not gain it back 
because the tabloids would attack her if she did she has put back 
on 17 pounds however and devoted another show to the gain 
john travolta took off 35 pounds and is in a new hit movie 
look whos talking 
gil gerard said in tv guide that his 75pound weight gain cost 
him 1 million in lost roles he joined overeaters anonymous and 
got his weight down to a muscular 200 pounds 
some stars nevertheless seem unaffected after putting on a few 
pounds roseanne barr has a hit show on abc and says she prefers 
being fat to being thin her costar john goodman doesnt lack 
for choice roles in major movies raymond burr stars regularly in a 
hit series of perry mason movies on nbc 
william conrad even stars in a cbs show called jake and the 
fat man marlon brando jack nicholson and shelley winters are 
all getting good roles 
burke has not lost any roles although the tabloids had stories 
that she was given ultimatums to lose weight or be kicked off 
designing women 
every story was a complete fabrication said linda 
bloodworththomason creator and coexecutive producer of the 
comedy series with her husband harry thomason its like if you 
gain weight you have no right to live in america i wrote this 
episode because i want to kick the tabloids right in the teeth 
its embarrassing to me and all of us at designing women 
that anyone would think we would fire someone for being 
overweight 
burke is not only under attack in the press but some radio disc 
jockeys regularly ridicule her theres even a song that goes 
delta dawn how many pounds have you put on 
its just gotten to the point of a crisis burke said in an 
interview theres been a lot of personal stuff about mac and me 
im not used to personal stuff then they began attacking my 
career its vicious ive worked hard to build up a good 
reputation and theyre trashing it 
they said i chased annie potts around the set they said i was 
hiding in my dressing room they said i was suspended for two 
weeks they said cbs gave me ultimatums to lose weight first they 
attacked me now theyre attacking mac they said he was feeding 
me that he said i was too fat that were having trouble that 
hes kicking me out 
a few days after the interview mcraney whom burke describes as 
an oldfashioned romanticist rented the ballroom at the 
biltmore hotel to celebrate their sixmonth anniversary 
burke said she retreated when the press reports first began i 
backed off she said i didnt want to help them hurt me i was 
also getting frustrated playing suzanne i wanted to show another 
side of her i went to linda and talked to her about doing a show 
on the weight she wrote this incredible script mac read it and 
cried 
she got a standing ovation from the studio audience at the 
taping 
doing that show was like a cleansing for me she said 
obviously i am overweight thats the only thing the tabloids got 
right its hard to live your life when youre being scrutinized 
and not approved of you have to change you back away and youre 
not as trusting i just want to work and live my life 
burke a former miss florida said people have been telling her 
she was fat since she was 16 i wasnt overweight she said 
i was just curvy i just didnt have the stick figure thats 
popular now she said she has spent so much of her life taking 
diet pills and going on fad diets that it has messed up my 
metabolism 
a quick diet isnt going to help my problem now she said 
you just gain the weight back i take a selfdefense class every 
monday night and its giving me more confidence and helping my 
selfesteem what im doing is changing my lifestyle but first i 
have to like me and accept me as i am you cant be perfect in this 
life but you can change and grow and strive to be better

new york the moment is imbedded in the nations memory a 
handicapped young man playing the guitar with his feet and singing 
for pope john paul ii and millions watching on television 
the day is filled with love sang tony melendez in los 
angeles on that september 1987 day today is like no other day 
before and you and i will never be the same 
suddenly the pope startled his phalanx of security guards and 
climbed over barricades to embrace melendez and bless with a kiss 
the musical talents of the crying man who was once turned away from 
the priesthood because he lacked arms with which to celebrate the 
eucharist 
you are giving hope to all of us my wish to you is to 
continue giving this hope to all the people the pope said 
the kiss made melendez an instant celebrity and he went from an 
itinerant musician who played for spare change on the streets of 
beach towns in southern california to a soughtafter concert artist 
and the author of a new book a gift of hope written with mel 
white 
i think the lord has something a mission for myself im not 
sure if its just to give hope to people like the pope said to 
make music or maybe just to tell people you can do it if tony can 
do it you can do as much maybe more melendez said 
in an interview from his home in chino calif the 27yearold 
melendez said his ministry is very subtle 
there is no waving of bibles no altar calls just a guy with 
a guitar sharing his life 
white his coauthor said sucess has not affected melendez 
ive written 23 books most of them about celebrities and tony 
is just the opposite white said hes not heroic hes just a 
simple guy who doesnt want anything to change 
he was born in a town in southwestern nicaragua his mother 
confusing her pregnancy with the flu had taken a prescribed 
capsule of thalidomide later found to cause birth defects 
to obtain medical care his family emigrated in 1963 to los 
angeles melendez applied at the end of his junior year in high 
school to become a priest 
the vatican turned him down without a thumb and forefinger to 
serve the eucharist he was told he could not be a priest 
but melendez said his interest in ministry never wavered 
more than just becoming a priest i wanted to somehow 
minister any kind of ministry i wanted to do 
he played guitar regularly at mass at two churches and was 
invited to audition to play before the pope 
still up to three weeks before his sept 15 date with the pope 
melendez played with an open guitar case seeking change from 
passersby on the boardwalk at laguna beach 
he recalls in his book that the moment the pope embraced him a 
voice inside him said yes it was for this that i was born it 
was for this that i came into the world 
he now travels the world in concert tours has sung at a world 
series and the summer olympics in seoul has one album out and 
another planned for january and a television movie on his life is 
being developed 
i really feel the lord sending me places that maybe even 
priests or nuns cannot go melendez said 
a celebrity in his own right he is able to share special 
moments with others especially those who can empathize with his 
physical condition 
at one concert a women who could not hear speak or talk put 
her hand on his guitar and started strumming her belly in time to 
the music 
ill never forget that it was so moving melendez said 
in his book melendez tells of going back for a concert at the 
universal amphitheater the scene of his triumph with the pope 
and encountering a badly deformed young woman in a wheelchair 
he said her eyes filled with tears as she struggled to tell him 
tony because of you we all have hope 
melendez said he did not know what to say 
i wanted to hold her in my absent arms and let my tears mingle 
with hers instead armless i thanked her and walked away

as they plan their strategies for the 1990s 
mutualfund investors might well find themselves in a quandary 
should they place their bets on aggressive stock funds hoping 
that the next decade will keep up the bullmarket dramatics of the 
80s or should they take a more defensive approach reasoning that 
less ebullient times lie ahead 
for the ordinary mortal not equipped with the power to foresee 
the future advisers say a compromise could be in order a fund 
that pursues the dual objectives of growth and income 
funds in this category invest heavily in the stock market but 
they generally shy away from shooting for big winners in 
speculative highrisk issues 
rather they tend to focus on established blue chips and other 
staid stocks whose size and record suggests they are unlikely to 
experience a sudden nosedive 
in addition many of those stocks offer more generous dividend 
yields than can be found in younger companies which keep most or 
all of the money they make to plow back into the business for 
growth 
a healthy dividend yield theoretically provides support should 
the stock market in general run into a prolonged period of weakness 
sounds pretty good doesnt it one brokerage house goes so far 
in its current promotional literature as to bill growthandincome 
funds the best of both worlds 
looking for longterm growth of capital and income without 
excessive price volatility it says growth and income funds 
may be for you 
the skeptical reader might detect a whiff of exaggeration in any 
claim of that sort normally to get high dividend income you have 
to accept relatively modest prospects for capital gains or vice 
versa 
as in any compromise in other words you expect to give up 
something to get something in return lately however growth and 
income funds have been defying that timehonored logic 
according to the wiesenberger investment companies service 
which monitors the performance of more than 900 mutual funds 
growth and income funds averaged a total return capital gains 
plus dividends of 125 percent from the end of 1983 through the 
third quarter of 1989 
that surpassed the 1091 percent gain posted by longterm growth 
funds 982 percent for funds seeking maximum capital gains and 
973 percent investing in stocks mainly for income 
since they occurred over a span of nearly six years its hard 
to dismiss these results as a temporary aberration managers of the 
best growth and income funds must have been doing something right 
also analysts say they had help from market conditions in the 
latter half of the 1980s there has been an extended vogue for the 
kind of bigname stocks that growth and income funds like to own 
price indexes of utility stocks another favorite holding 
recently have hit new highs perhaps most important of all these 
funds have thrived on a combination of rising stock prices and 
falling interest rates trends that have not always coincided in 
the past 
can they keep it up in the new decade most observers agree the 
answer depends in large measure on whether investment fashions 
change 
from the mid1970s until the summer of 1983 the atmosphere 
favored lowdividend rapid growth stocks sales of mutual funds 
specializing in that sector of the market soared just as they were 
approaching their peak 
were stocks to fall and interest rates rise in some future 
period growth and income funds could find themselves hit with a 
double whammy 
but for now at least they can boast that they have allowed 
singleshitter investors to outscore their counterparts who 
swing for the fences

mexicos commercial bank creditors have 
committed about 90 percent of a financing package for 19891992 
covering about 48 billion of mexican medium and longterm debt 
according to an official announcement 
the remaining commitments are expected by the end of this week 
mexican finance undersecretary angel gurria and bank representative 
william r rhodes said in a joint communique tuesday 
rhodes is cochairman of a 15member bank committee that reached 
a preliminary agreement with mexico last july and recommended its 
approval to mexicos approximately 400 creditor banks 
to date 345 banks have committed to the package the communique 
said only two banks with small exposure have so far declined to 
participate 
we are getting positive responses from some banks that havent 
participated in the process for a number of years rhodes said 
banks commitments to the three options in the package are 
following the pattern anticipated by rhodes at a press conference 
nov 14 new money is running between 8 percent and 10 percent of 
the total committed the remainder is split about evenly between 
repackaged debt in which either the principal or interest has been 
reduced the announcement said 
the communique said the signing of the agreements is expected to 
start before the end of december assuming continuing rapid 
progress in completing the complex legal documentation 
the package covers nearly half of mexicos total 107 billion 
foreign debt second in the developing world to the 120 billion 
owed by brazil 
the package represents the first significant reduction in a 
third world governments debt to international commercial banks it 
is considered an important step in the third world debt crisis that 
began seven years ago when mexico announced in august 1982 it was 
unable to meet obligations 
since then third world debt has grown to about 13 trillion 
the agreement has also been seen as a test of the bush 
administrations policy for reducing third world debt and as a 
milestone for other countries waiting to renegotiate 
under the agreement the creditor banks have three options a 35 
percent reduction in principal reduction of the interest rate on 
loans to 625 percent from around 10 percent previously or 
providing new loans equal to 25 percent of what mexico owes the 
bank

along with east european freedom seekers the 
berlin wall is attracting american admakers 
in the month since the historic opening of the border between 
east and west germany admakers for pepsicola co american 
telephone amp telegraph co and the fragrance marketer quintessence 
have filmed commercials at the wall 
they said their ads which will be running through ther holiday 
season are designed to celebrate the exhilaration and emotion of 
newly won freedom 
pepsicola the soft drink arm of pepsico inc said tuesday its 
commercial features a documentarystyle montage of people 
approaching the wall about 10 days after the border was opened in 
early november 
its admakers tried to blend in with the news crews that were 
there to capture genuine unscripted moments that exemplified the 
joys of freedom said pepsi spokesman tod mackenzie 
in the 30second commercial that was scheduled to debut next 
tuesday night and run repeatedly on network television through jan 
1 mackenzie said a young woman is shown handing a flower to a 
border guard and a group of young children use small hammers to 
chip at the wall no actors were used in the ad 
in this season of giving the gift of freedom is the greatest 
gift of all a narrator says the pepsicola name appears at the 
end of the spot but it makes no specific product pitch 
admakers for atampt interviewed people at the wall and near the 
border crossing points in berlin in which they recalled what they 
did when the border was opened and how it made them feel 
a number of those interviewed told how they called friends and 
relatives with the news those interviews will be intercut with 
interviews being shot now in the united states of people who have 
relatives in east or west germany 
oneminute and 30second versions of the ad will be made for use 
on television starting dec 17 according to the admakers 
the idea was that we can help people share their thoughts and 
feelings said david robertson division manager of advertising 
for atampt in basking ridge nj 
the quintessence ad tells the story about an elderly east german 
man crossing the border into west berlin evidently to be reunited 
with his family and a grandson he may have never seen 
as the man passes through a checkpoint his grandson runs toward 
him and they embrace an east german border guard picks up a teddy 
bear that the older man dropped and hands it to the youngster 
the commercial was designed to acquaint people with the name of 
the privatelyheld fragrance company formerly beecham cosmetics 
whose brands include jovan musk and adidas for men according to 
president joseph aramanda 
it is a holiday message that says peace on earth he said 
the commercial filmed in late november in west berlin debuts 
dec 12 on network television during a broadcast of cbs beauty amp 
the beast 
victor zast senior vice president for marketing at the 
chicagobased quintessence said the ad included five west germans 
and 18 east germans who were offered the equivalent of 55 to 
appear in the ad the same as east germans were getting as a 
welcoming gift from the west german government upon arriving in 
that nation in the first days after the border was opened 
crowd control was something of a problem zast said but he 
said the admakers were blessed with a snowstorm the morning 
they started shooting the ad a fitting start to a holiday 
commercial 
in another move marking changing eastwest relations cocacola 
co this week is airing a slightly altered version of its general 
assembly commercial for cocacola classic which features more 
than 1000 young people from many nations singing a song in 16 
languages 
the songs message promise us tomorrow and well build a 
better world for you marked the 1987 reykjavik summit between 
former president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the version airing this week carries these words on the screen 
at the end today as barriers between people come down 
cocacola celebrates the hope of a better tomorrow

defense lawyers in the gaf corp stock 
manipulation trial have introduced newly obtained telephone records 
that appear to contradict pivotal government testimony about calls 
discussing the alleged fraud 
gaf attorney arthur liman called the records which previously 
were thought to be nonexistent obviously very crucial 
extraordinary 
the new evidence indicates no calls were placed on longdistance 
wats lines from the jefferies amp co brokerage to gaf or its vice 
chairman james t sherwin during times in october 1986 when the 
government alleges the manipulation was discussed 
the defense rested its case tuesday after actress liv ullman 
testified on sherwins behalf as the final witness in the 
sevenweek criminal trial in manhattan federal court 
gaf two subsidiaries and sherwin are charged with allegedly 
trying to boost union carbide corps share price in 1986 shortly 
before selling a large block of the stock after a failed takeover 
bid they also were charged with securities fraud wire fraud and 
conspiracy 
the case is in its third trial after two mistrials earlier this 
year 
jefferies amp co trading director james t melton has testified 
he called sherwin between 430 pm and 5 pm on oct 29 30 and 
31 in 1986 shortly after the pacific stock exchange closed to 
discuss actions taken those days to close the stock above 22 a 
share as allegedly ordered by sherwin 
other calls to sherwin to discuss the scheme allegedly were made 
while he was at his doctors office and at standard amp poors corp 
but american telephone amp telegraph co records introduced monday 
indicate that no calls were made during the half hour in question 
on any of jefferies amp cos 15 wats lines to gaf or sherwin or to 
the other offices 
liman said the records contradicted testimony by melton and his 
trading assistant maureen oconnor who said melton called sherwin 
within moments of the markets close 
defense lawyers said privately they believe the new information 
shows that the calls to sherwin never were made no records of the 
calls appeared on jefferies amp cos regular longdistance telephone 
bills either 
the defense called an atampt supervisor who retrieved the records 
and a private investigator who analyzed them on the witness stand 
assistant us attorney carl h loewenson jr did not attempt to 
rebut the testimony 
the purpose of the alleged stock manipulation was to maximize 
profits after a failed takeover attempt by wayne njbased gaf of 
much larger union carbide gaf a specialty chemicals company held 
10 million shares of union carbide after the failed bid and sold 5 
million in november 1986 for 23 a share 
ullman testified she has known sherwin 10 years through work on 
a refugee settlement organization the international rescue 
committee ullman is a vice president of the group and sherwin is 
chairman of its executive committee 
i would say he is from my heart the most honorable moral 
man i have ever met the norwegian film star said under 
questioning from sherwins lawyer stephen kaufman 
ullman who has appeared in such films as director ingemar 
bergmans cries and whispers and scenes from a marriage 
testified for about 10 minutes about her career extensive human 
rights work and association with sherwin 
afterward she talked briefly with sherwin and kissed him on the 
cheek before leaving the courthouse 
closing arguments in the trial were expected to last two days 
and the case could go to the jury for deliberations friday

texas instruments inc has little to say about a 
lawsuit that claims the company artificially depressed its stock 
price last month by not quickly disclosing a japanese patent 
potentially worth billions of dollars 
the classaction suit filed in dallas federal court monday 
claimed the company misrepresented its financial prospects by not 
disclosing that it had been granted the patent in japan for the 
basic computer chip 
industry analysts estimate that the patent which was issued 
oct 30 could generate 100 million to 300 million in annual 
royalties from japanese companies until it expires in november 2001 
the lawsuit alleges that texas instruments knew about the 
japanese patent ruling as early as august and that the company 
should have mentioned it in a thirdquarter earnings report 
released oct 20 
texas instruments did not inform investors about the patent 
until after a japanese business newspaper reported the story nov 
21 
because investors were not told of the prospects for the 
japanese patent the earnings report contained 
misrepresentations about texas instruments prospects of 
increased revenues from royalties according to the lawsuit 
texas instruments spokesman stan victor said monday that the 
company is confident that it has fully complied with us 
disclosure requirements victor declined further comment 
on nov 20 the day before the japanese patent became public 
knowledge texas instruments announced plans to take a 55 million 
writedown in fourthquarter earnings and to lay off up to 1500 
domestic employees 
texas instruments stock closed at 29 a share on nov 20 but 
rose to 36 by the close of trading nov 22 following the patent 
announcement 
the suit was brought by an investor margot broza of new york 
who had purchased five options to sell texas instruments stock in 
november 
she claims to represent all investors who sold texas instruments 
stock or bought options on texas instruments stock between oct 20 
and nov 22 more than 14 million texas instruments shares were 
traded by thousands of investors during the period 
the suit seeks compensatory damages resulting from the trading 
of undervalued stock 
jerry junkins texas instruments president and chief executive 
officer bill george a ti executive vice president and john

program trading activity dropped sharply in the 
first two weeks of november after a backlash against the 
controversial strategy which is blamed by some for causing market 
turmoil 
new york stock exchange figures released tuesday showed a steep 
decline in index arbitrage the main form of computerized program 
trading reflecting an exodus by large brokerages from the strategy 
after it came under fire following the sharp stock market drop of 
oct 13 
index arbitrage accounted for 387 percent of program trades 
from nov 610 and 257 percent from nov 1317 down from 538 
percent in all of october the big board said in its first weekly 
reports on program trading 
the nyse is releasing the data as part of a series of moves to 
control stock market volatility implemented after the sudden 
190point market decline on friday the 13th and an 80point rise 
oct 24 
the new figures also indicated a large jump in program trading 
compared with the rest of the week during a sharp intraday decline 
on nov 6 when the dow jones industrials average fell 30 points 
from the previous days close at 1115 am 
the big board said program trading accounted for 136 percent 
or 194 million shares of 143 million shares traded from 11 am 
to 1130 am 
as part of its weekly report the nyse said it will profile 
program trading activity for halfhour periods when the dow drops 
30 points from the previous days close or moves 30 points in a 
single direction 
since the nyse does not break down program trading daily it is 
not possible to determine whether the amount of program trading in 
the halfhour period on nov 6 exceeded program trading the rest of 
the day 
overall in the first weekly report program trading strategies 
accounted for 67 million of an average daily nyse volume of 1488 
million shares or 45 percent buy programs totaled 30 million 
shares and sell programs 37 million the exchange said 
for the second week the trading totaled 79 percent of an 
average daily volume of 1477 million shares or 116 million 
shares a day buy programs accounted for 77 million shares and 
sell programs for 39 million shares 
the big board defines program trading as any order for the 
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks index arbitrage 
involves rapid trading of stocks in new york and stockindex 
futures in chicago to profit from momentary price discrepancies 
between the two markets 
critics say index arbitrage exaggerates market movements 
triggering waves of selling and sometimes buying defenders say the 
strategy helps stabilize trading by linking the two markets 
pulling prices closer together 
the new nyse figures showed a drop in program trading from 
october when the strategies accounted for 97 percent of daily 
nyse volume of 1824 million shares or 177 million shares a day 
the exchange began compiling program trading volume on a monthly 
basis in august 1988 the lowest monthly total to date was 76 
percent last april 
morgan stanley amp co which ceased index arbitrage for its own 
account but continues it for customers was the leader in the 
trading with 109 million shares for nov 610 and 232 million 
shares nov 1317 salomon brothers inc was a distant second with 
49 million shares traded the first week and 45 million the second

a 93 percent decline in latenovember sales of 
north americanmade cars and light trucks continues a downward 
trend that one analyst says reflects boredom among consumers over 
the new model lineup 
the eight major automakers with us assembly plants reported 
tuesday they sold vehicle at an average daily rate of 37059 during 
nov 2130 compared with 40843 a day on average during the same 
time last year 
car sales were down 125 percent and light truck sales were off 
38 percent 
the slump during the 10day period continues a decline that 
began in early october just as the 1990 model year got under way 
theres not a lot of excitement left in the industry said 
auto analyst paul kleinaitis of duff amp phelps inc in chicago 
everybodys got sort of the same cars 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp which 
make up more than threequarters of the north americanproduced 
auto market reported their combined car and truck sales fell 14 
percent during the period this year compared with last year 
for the month of november with imported cars and trucks counted 
in vehicle sales fell 119 percent with car sales dropping 135 
percent and light truck sales off 85 percent 
through the first 11 months of this year domestic and import 
car and truck sales were running 45 percent behind last years 
pace with car sales down 5 percent and light truck sales off 32 
percent 
gm said sales of its north americanbuilt cars fell 24 percent 
and light truck sales declined 151 percent 
since about the first of october weve had less traffic 
said frank debartolo general sales manager of celozziettleson 
chevroletgeo in elmhurst ill the last quarter has taken quite 
a bite out of us 
last summer automakers were faced with swollen newcar 
inventories prompting them to lay on incentive packages to move 
the vehicles out of showrooms the incentives coupled with news of 
pending price increases when the 1990 models began rolling into 
dealer lots in early october forced some people to buy 1989 models 
rather than 1990s 
that resulted in some fourthquarter sales being stolen by the 
third quarter 
what were seeing now however is more than payback for the 
pullahead said fords sales vice president robert rewey some 
prospective buyers are deferring purchases due to uncertainty about 
the economic outlook 
more than anything else that uncertainty is fueled by high 
interest rates 
debartolo said he expected the 1990 sales slump to end in a 
month or two mainly because he sees no longterm economic downturn 
as far as the economy goes everything is stable he said 
theres nothing drastic thats going to happen 
gms combined domestic car and truck sales were down 211 
percent in late november this year compared with last year for the 
entire year gms car and truck sales were down 55 percent 
ford said its latenovember vehicle sales were 61 percent 
behind last years pace as car sales dropped 87 percent and light 
truck sales fell 26 percent 
through november of this year fords car and truck sales were 
running 26 percent lower than during the first 11 months of last 
year 
chrysler said its latenovember car sales fell 157 percent but 
its truck sales during the period rose 16 percent combining for a 
7 percent decrease yeartodate sales of chrysler cars and light 
trucks were running 64 percent below last years pace

the tokyo stock exchanges key index closed at a 
record high today for the 10th time in the last 11 trading days 
while the dollar rose marginally against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 16012 points or 043 
percent closing at 3765429 it had gained 19030 points on 
tuesday in its current recordsetting run which paused only friday 
today the index dipped in early trading on selling to take 
profits but daiwa securities dealer kazuyuki suzuki said 
investors buying incentives were much stronger than their concerns 
over the rapid increase in share prices 
it seems the index just could not stop rising he said 
adding that it probably will reach 38000 by the years end 
on the first section an estimated 12 billion shares changed 
hands down from tuesdays 13 billion among gainers were 
electrical housing and chemical shares 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14375 yen up 007 
yen from tuesdays close of 14368 yen it opened at 14372 yen and 
stayed in a narrow range between 14365 yen and 14376 yen the 
dollar now has climbed 085 yen in the last four days 
the range is just getting narrower and narrower mitsui bank 
trader yoshitsugu hanada said attributing this to a lack of fresh 
marketaffecting news 
spot trading totaled 31 billion down from tuesdays 41 
billion 
the dollar also moved little against the west german mark 
despite traders expectations that the us currency would weaken 
against the mark hanada said 
it didnt work that way here because japanese investors still 
have strong demand for the dollar he said 
he added that recent currency rates were influenced more by 
investors supply and demand rather than economic trends 
thus fridays announcement of us unemployment figures for 
november will have little impact on the market he said

fast food is serious stuff to don smith 
the taco bell distinguished professor at washington state 
university there are no easy as in burger flipping 101 here 
we are a business school says smith who holds what is 
believed to be the first university endowment paid for by a 
fastfood chain in his classes students study market research and 
motivational training not milkshake theory or the physics of 
french fries 
fast food is big business smith said with 60 billion in 
annual sales and that is of more than academic interest to his 
students 
the number one thing that drives a student in our college is 
career he said that may not be what academics like but 
our kids come here so they can get out of here and improve their 
state of living 
graduates of smiths program leave with five or six career 
offers he said with salaries starting at 20000 a year and 
rising to more than 30000 after three years 
of this years 90 graduates from the universitys hotel and 
restaurant administration program 18 entered the fastservice 
industry 
one such former student is scott fisher a taco bell district 
manager in the seattle area 
fisher who says he makes damn good money and drives a 
corvette thinks more colleges should offer career training for the 
fastservice industry 
theres a lot of engineers coming out of colleges but at two 
years out of college i was making more than an engineer said 
fisher who supervises 120 employees at five restaurants that do a 
combined 4 million worth of business annually 
where is a 24yearold going to get that kind of chance 
smith asked fast food 
taco bell corp gave washington state a 250000 endowment this 
year matched by a state grant to increase the number of trained 
professionals in the industry and conduct academic research 
smith 60 was chosen last month after the university advertised 
the post nationally and reviewed about 40 applicants he has a 
masters degree in education from the university of illinois and 
has been teaching at washington states hotel and restaurant school 
since 1986 
smith knows the fastfood business from bitter experience his 
attempt to open a taco restaurant in the 1960s was less than a 
rousing success 
i didnt know the farmers in dekalb illinois didnt like 
tacos he recalled with a laugh 
he went on to a successful 13 years as managing partner of a 
chicago restaurant chateau louise and then became director of new 
ventures for kentucky fried chicken served as president of the 
shakeys pizza chain and moved on to become director of the school 
of hotel restaurant and institutional management at michigan state 
university 
he approaches every task with the energy and enthusiasm that 
made him a successful high school football coach in the 1950s some 
of the management skills he teaches students come straight from the 
locker room 
successful fastfood managers must give their teenage employees 
selfconfidence just as a coach must do smith said 
when you can enhance a teenagers selfesteem theyll kill 
themselves for you he said and by the way money ranks fourth 
in what motivates them 
while the workforce is young smith said the average age of 
fastservice customers is rising 
the customer is what counts that middleclass american who is 
timepoor doesnt want to spend money for tipping but wants good 
quality food he said 
smiths students dont learn cooking skills at school their 
courses focus more on managerial topics such as market research 
which he believes is a key to success in the restaurant business 
fastfooders are consumer researchfocused he said 
mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken burger king taco bell pizza 
hut they know more about where their customers head is and where 
it is going and theyre building their menus to suit those 
customers 
weve had a lot of skeptics about fast service but you know 
what it amounts to is real simple the american public doesnt 
listen they vote with their pocketbooks and fast food has grown 
faster and continues to grow twice as fast as the entire industry

canadian pacific ltd said it intends to spin 
off its real estate portfolio valued at more than 3 billion and 
has adopted an antitakeover defense 
president william stinson said tuesday that the company knew of 
no takeover threats but decided to adopt a poison pill as a 
preemptive measure 
rumors circulated last summer about an impending takeover of the 
montrealbased conglomerate which has interests in numerous aspects 
of the canadian economy including transportation energy forest 
products telecommunications and real estate 
analysts say canadian pacific would be rich pickings for a 
raider with an eye on dismantling it possible buyers mentioned in 
rumors were the british conglomerate hanson plc and montreals paul 
desmarais president of cashrich power corp 
canadian pacific plans to spin off its marathon realty co 
turning it into a publicly traded company eighty percent of 
marathon will be distributed to canadian pacific shareholders and 
the remaining 20 percent will be retained by canadian pacific 
which will help marathon in developing the potential of its 
property holdings 
the distribution was approved in principle by canadian pacifics 
board of directors on tuesday the plan will be implemented once it 
is approved by shareholders and after certain other conditions are 
met 
canadian pacific said the book value of marathons assets is 
about 21 canadian dollars but internal estimates indicate its 
current market value exceeds 4 billion canadian dollars or about 
343 billion 
meanwhile the company also announced tuesday that upon the 
occurrence of certain triggering events stockholders will have 
the right to acquire shares at 50 per cent of market value a move 
that would significantly dilute stock value 
the events include acquisition of 10 per cent or more of 
ordinary shares or of ordinary and preferred shares by a buyer 
who doesnt have approval from the board of directors 
canadian pacific said the aim of the plan is to ensure 
shareholders get the most for their stock under any takeover 
stinson at a gathering of financial analysts in toronto 
emphasized the posion pill is a preemptive measure and he is not 
aware of any pending or threatened takeover bids for the company 
i dont know of any action in the stock that would suggest an 
impending takeover its been quiet of late he said 
poison pills used for the first time in canada by inco ltd 
last fall but widely prevalent in the united states are aimed at 
discouraging hostile takeovers by burdening a company with debt or 
triggering a dilution of stock 
canadian pacifics poison pill must be approved at the companys 
annual meeting next may 
canadian pacific shares closed on the toronto stock exchange on 
tuesday at 2512 canadian dollars down 12 cents

the us economy will continue to weaken next 
year but there will be neither a recession nor any substantial 
change in unemployment the nations top business economists 
predicted today in a forecast their president said was the most 
enthusiastic ever 
the national association of business economists said a survey of 
its members found 62 percent expecting no recession for the next 
three years 
its a seachange said james f smith nabe president and 
finance professor at the university of north carolina we never 
ever had not just a majority but an overwhelming majority 
forecasting growth over three years 
however nearly 20 percent of the respondents said a recession 
will occur either by the end of the year or during the first three 
months of 1990 ending an unprecedented peacetime economic 
expansion that began its eighth year this month 
the new report was considerably more optimistic than last mays 
survey which found 63 percent of the economists expecting a 
recession next year three months later 37 percent of the 
economists still forecast recession in 1990 
smith said the last time the nabe survey correctly forecast a 
recession was in 1980 when it predicted the 198182 economic 
downturn but he added that since 1983 the economists have been 
within one percentage point of forecasting the following years 
gross national product 
in the november survey the consensus among the 59 respondents 
was that the gross national product the nations total output of 
goods and services would continue to grow slowly dropping from 
the 29 percent forecast for 1989 to 18 percent next year 
the survey also showed an easing of inflation fears with 
predictions that the consumer price index will fall from 48 
percent forecast for 1989 to 42 percent next year 
at the same time the economists expect interest rates would 
continue to fall with rates on threemonth treasury bills dropping 
from 81 percent in 1989 to 71 percent in 1990 for 30year 
treasury bonds the expected estimate is 78 percent next year 
compared with 84 percent this year 
the economy has slowed considerably this year as the federal 
reserve boosted interest rates to restrain rising prices but it 
began in june to gradually let rates fall as inflationary pressures 
moderated 
the manufacturing sector has been among the hardest hit by fed 
actions and the economists forecast continued weakness in 
industrial production 
but their report said the slower overall growth and weaker 
industrial production is not expected to be reflected in higher 
unemployment 
the survey suggested unemployment would rise only from 53 
percent this year to 55 percent next year that was down from the 
58 percent predicted in their may survey and 57 percent in august 
the housing industry hurt by higher interest rates earlier this 
year is expected to improve modestly with housing starts rising 
from 14 million in 1989 to 145 million in 1990 the economists 
said 
but they foresee no relief for the automobile industry a third 
sector in the economic doldrums car and small truck sales they 
said would drop from 151 million this year to 147 million in 
1990 
the nabe report also suggested changes in the expected 
composition of the gnp in 1990 
consumer demand is expected to constitute a significantly 
larger share of growth while investment reflecting a deteriorating 
outlook for corporate profits is expected to weaken it said 
the nabe also said its forecasters predicted the nations twin 
deficits in merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow 
but only very slowly 
for 1990 the trade imbalance should be about 100 billion 
down from 109 billion in 1989 and federal spending will exceed 
revenue by 141 billion after a reported 152 billion in fiscal 
1989 it said

the nations commercial banks lost 744 
million in the third quarter this year the first loss in more than 
two years the government said today 
the bulk of the red ink was concentrated in several large banks 
that set aside new reserves for expected losses on loans to third 
world nations as well as in rising real estate loan problems in 
the northeast and arizona the federal deposit insurance corp said 
fdic chairman l william seidman also said the insurance fund 
protecting deposits at 12824 us banks likely will record the 
second loss in its history this year the fund declined by about 4 
billion in 1988 and will shrink by an additional 250 million to 
500 million this year he said 
bank failures totaling 192 so far this year likely will 
approach but not exceed last years record of 211 seidman said 
based on a fall in the number of problem banks from 1394 at the 
start of 1989 to 1134 at the end of september he predicted the 
failure rate would decline next year 
seidman said banks should approach commercial and development 
real estate lending more cautiously although bank profits overall 
likely will bounce back in the final three months of 1989 the 
number of sour real estate loans will continue to rise he 
predicted 
i dont want to scrooge up christmas but im afraid the 
fourth quarter will show a continuation of the real estate trends 
we see here seidman said 
the loss in the julyseptember period compares with profits of 
7 billion in the second quarter and 73 billion in the first 
quarter last year banks earned a record profit of 252 billion 
commercial banks last recorded a loss in the second quarter of 
1987 red ink totaled 106 billion and was attributed to losses on 
developing country lending 
some of the nations largest banks again took writedowns in the 
third quarter on their loans to developing countries jp morgan amp 
co increased its loss reserves by 2 billion chase manhattan 
corp by 13 billion and manufacturers hanover trust corp by 950 
million 
analysts attributed the writedowns to banks recognition that 
treasury secretary nicholas f bradys debt strategy will require 
them to accept more losses 
bradys plan launched in march emphasizes debt reduction as 
well as new lending to developing countries however critics of 
the plan worry that banks will be reluctant to make new loans after 
recognizing big losses 
commercial real estate lending problems common in the southwest 
since the mid1980s are spreading elsewhere in august moodys 
investor service warned that involvement in real estate lending 
makes large banks vulnerable to rising interest rates or a 
recession 
in a speech tuesday seidman called real estate lending is an 
emerging area of concern and said his agency was studying real 
estate markets nationwide 
over the last 12 months real estate loan growth has accounted 
for nearly twothirds of all bank asset growth and now comprises 
almost onefourth of all commercial bank assets seidman told a 
meeting of the national council of savings institutions in new york 
delinquent real estate loans constitute almost half of all sour 
loans nationally he said in the northeast the percentage of 
delinquent real estate loans has doubled in the past year he said

support said analyst martyn foreman of agrivisor service inc in 
bloomington ill

merger negotiations have nearly collapsed between 
the stateowned renault automaker and swedens volvo and both 
companies are seeking other possible partners 
french industry minister roger fauroux disclosed the stalled 
negotiations tuesday leaving the two automakers vulnerable in the 
face of intensifying competition in europe 
no one should expect a largescale operation or a global 
linkup in the coming weeks he told a news conference that 
would be an illusion 
the companies have been talking for several months on 
collaboration that might eventually have led to a full merger of 
their car and truck building activities 
one possible outcome would have given renault control of volvos 
car activities while the swedish group would have been given 
responsibility for renaults rvi truck division 
fauroux told reporters that although the talks have entered what 
he called a less active phase this does not mean that we cannot 
arrive at a partial solution he did not elaborate on what a 
partial solution might mean 
french auto industry analysts said it now appears that the two 
groups have limited the scope of their negotiations to possible 
technical or commercial cooperation they said the swedes 
apparently balked over the idea of such a large chunk of swedish 
industry coming under the french national flag 
volvo and renault already have a joint venture that manufactures 
car engines while volvo acts as renaults distributor in sweden

employees in honeywell incs washington 
area office were pressured by their supervisors in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s to obtain secret budget documents from the 
pentagon a federal court jury was told today 
retired honeywell employee frank lozito testified that among 
those he received documents from was former boeing co worker 
richard lee fowler who is on trial on charges of illegally 
obtaining budget documents from the pentagon 
folwer has pleaded innocent to 39 counts including conspiracy 
illegal conveyance of classfied documents and mail fraud boeing 
has pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents and has agreed 
to pay a 52 million fine 
lozito said he was asked by his supervisor to get classified air 
force budget documents and turned to fowler an old friend for 
help 
honeywell worked on a managementbyobjective system lozito 
said of his minneapolisbased employer 
lozito said one of his objectives was to establish meaningful 
contacts with the air force and that meant getting classified 
documents containing budget information the pentagon used to plan 
its spending 
such material could help defense contractors such as boeing and 
honeywell in bidding for defense projects by giving them inside 
information on what the pentagon would want 
lozito said he got documents from fowler five or 10 times a 
year from 1979 to early 1984 
fowler often passed him documents on the street outside boeings 
arlington va office lozito said adding that he copied the 
documents and returned the originals to fowler 
donna fountain a senior security administrator for honeywell 
testified that in the early 1980s she was ordered to keep a 
separate log of classified documents that lozito and others brought 
into the honeywell office 
the log was kept in a separate case that was not available 
to defense investigative service inspectors who worked for the 
pentagon she said 
ms fountain said the documents were kept in the personal safes 
of the employees involved and were removed from honeywell offices 
before such inspections 
i thought it was part of the old boy network friends helping 
friends ms fountain said i believed it was quite widespread 
in the industry 
both ms fountain and lozito testified with guaranteed immunity 
from prosecution by us attorneys 
fowlers attorneys have said their client was hired specifically 
to get the documents for boeing they were readily available to 
defense contractors rules covering their release were unclear and 
charges were filed against him only after he refused to tell 
defense investigative services inspectors who gave him the 
documents 
fowler worked for boeing from 1979 until he was fired in 1986 
three former boeing security employees testified tuesday that 
classified material was logged at the seattlebased aerospace 
companys office in the washington suburb of arlington 
they said pentagon inspectors never raised questions about the 
documents listed in the logs 
deborah null who was a clerk at the arlington office from 1978 
to 1984 testified that inspectors reviewed boeings classified 
record log twice a year and the log included specific references to 
the documents fowler is accused of obtaining illegally 
ms null also said that even though military rules required that 
she have receipts from the pentagon before entering the documents 
in the log dis officials and boeing employees including fowler 
said it was no problem if she didnt

hundreds of thousands of investors rushed to beat 
the wednesday deadline for applying to buy shares in britains 
water industry under the governments 82 billion privatization of 
the business 
there had been concern the sale would attract little interest 
because of the british stock markets recent sluggishness the 
privatization also has been strongly opposed by critics who say 
such a vital utility should remain in state hands for security 
reasons and to protect consumers from rate hikes 
but a line stretched for some 250 yards outside national 
westminster bank in the city of london financial district as the 10 
am deadline approached 
geoff taylor privatization manager for natwest said the bank 
had handled previous selloffs of government industries and i 
dont think we have ever had a queue as long as this 
environment minister michael howard said it is a 
reaffirmation of popular capitalism and i am very pleased with 
that it is obviously a very enthusiastic response 
some investors said their desire for profit outweighed any 
opposition they had to the selloff on the unofficial gray 
market the share price is trading at a 27 percent premium to the 
governments offering price 
i am not politically in favor of privatizing water but if 
its going to happen i may as well have a bit of it said 
electrician edward sutton who applied for 2500 shares 
the government has structured the 140 penceashare sale so that 
investors put down 100 pence the equivalent of about 157 a 
share and pay the rest in installments spanning 20 months 
schroders plc the investment firm advising the government in 
its latest privatization said the sale of the 10 english and welsh 
water authorities was wellsubscribed 
the offer is expected to be oversubscribed but schroders said 
exact information on the demand would not be available until later 
in the week because hundreds of thousands of application forms 
were handed in at the last minute 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of dollars worth of stateowned companies in the 
past decade 
the government also is planning to sell britains electricity 
industry by mid1992 in what could be the biggest sale yet at an 
estimated 31 billion 
most sales of such companies as jaguar plc and british airways 
plc have been successful however the governments sale of its 
remaining onethird stake in british petroleum co plc flopped 
because it coincided with the october 1987 stock market crash 
when the government announced the price of the 2183 million 
water shares last month critics said the shares were priced too 
cheaply to attract buyers

grain and soybean futures prices closed higher in 
active trading wednesday on the chicago board of trade as traders 
reacted to prospects of increased export activity 
wheat led the way in the rally with buying spurred by news that 
the us department of agriculture has targeted china for 1 million 
metric tons of wheat under the departments export enhancement 
program 
under eep private exporters can sell us commodities at 
reduced prices to meet foreign competition in selected overseas 
markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or 
other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
there is speculation that the soviet union will be next to 
benefit from the program said analyst ted mao of shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
us and soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new 
longterm grain pact the current grain pact will expire next year 
corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting 
from the strong surge in wheat prices mao said 
the same held true for soybeans which also drew support from 
slow farmer selling and reports of barge delays on the mississippi 
river 
analysts said prices were held back by a lack of export 
business and news that argentine farmers are enjoying adequate 
soil moisture and are moving ahead with soybean planting 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with december at 235 a bushel oats were

saatchi amp saatchi co plc the worlds largest 
advertising and marketing services company reported wednesday it 
lost 585 million pounds or 92 million for its fiscal year due 
to high costs and troubles with its consulting business 
while the loss was larger than many analysts had expected they 
said that it resulted largely from management decisions to take 
some unusual writedowns 
the loss for the 12 months ended sept 30 contrasted with a net 
profit of 751 million pounds which is about 118 million or 445 
pence a share in the previous year 
revenue totalled 9735 million pounds or 15 billion up 13 
percent from 8622 million pounds a year earlier 
saatchi said its pretax profits sank 48 percent to 613 million 
pounds or 96 million from 117 million pounds or 184 million a 
year earlier 
the company reported unusual costs of 395 million pounds or 
62 million to cover potential rental costs of surplus office 
space and the cost of a reorganization and redundancies in the 
communications division which includes advertising agencies 
it also had an extraordinary cost of 22 million pounds or 35 
million arising from its consulting business 
communication revenue rose 76 percent to 725 million pounds or 
11 billion while consulting revenue rose 32 percent to 2485 
million pounds or 390 million 
the major problem this year has been costs rather than 
revenues saatchi said 
saatchi has embarked on a number of changes in recent months 
refocusing its business strategy away from consulting and adding 
several senior personnel in october robert louisdreyfus was 
appointed chief executive of the group 
emma hill who follows the advertising agency business for 
wertheim amp co in new york said the significance of this report 
is that the new ceo seems to be cleaning house and forcing a hard 
look at the business 
the company reportedly is having difficulty in getting the price 
it wants for its consulting businesses which it bought for about 
250 million pounds or 393 million saatchi hopes to raise up to 
350 million pounds or about 550 million from the sales it has 
already sold three consulting businesses gamma mdk and cleveland 
consulting associates for 25 million 
it said in wednesdays earnings announcement that it has also 
agreed to sell its interest in information consulting group to 
mckinsey amp co for 12 million 
james dougherty an analyst with county natwest securities usa 
in new york said saatchi had invested about 30 million in that 
operation which was created about a year ago by a group that 
included some topranking executives from arthur andersen and other 
accounting firms 
he said the operation had been a drain on saatchis earnings 
saatchi noted that its remaining consulting operations have 
strong brand names and said it is not prepared to give up these 
valuable assets for less than their market value 
the company didnt break out quarterly or halfyear results it 
isnt required to under british law

stock prices ended lower in listless trading 
today as investors remained cautious ahead of the governments 
unemployment report 
theres a lack of direction people dont know what to do 
said hildegarde zagorski analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc theyre sitting around waiting for fridays report 
data suggesting a further slowdown in economic growth likely 
would be positive for the market analysts said because it would 
raise expectations that the federal reserve would continue easing 
interest rates 
a government report on thirdquarter productivity and the feds 
beige book summary of economic conditions was generally 
neutral for the stock market dealers said 
the labor department reported that productivity in the nonfarm 
sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 25 percent in 
the third quarter while hours worked grew at a slower 13 percent 
a sign of slackening demand for goods 
however the bond market which had been stagnant in recent 
sessions reacted negatively to the fed report which said the 
nations economy was stable to modestly expanding dealers said 
weakness in the credit market helped weaken stock prices after 
midday 
banking stocks highlighted selling activity after the government 
reported that the nations commercial banks lost 744 million in 
the third quarter due partly to rising real estate loan problems 
weakness in ibm stock led technology issues lower after gains in 
the previous two sessions dealers said investors were selling the 
stock amid uncertainty about the impact of a massive restructuring

the dollar declined against most major foreign

currency dealers received an incentive to sell dollars from 
reports that a us treasury official said the dollars recent 
decline against the mark was not alarming said thomas palladino 
an assistant vice president in the amsterdam rotterdam banks new 
york office 
the remark attributed to david mulford treasury undersecretary 
was interpreted to mean the us government would not intervene 
aggressively in foreign exchange markets to stem the dollars slide 
against the mark 
it seems everybody is looking for a lower dollar palladino 
said its more of a markdriven market than a dollardriven 
market 
some dealers said the strength of the west german economy 
justified the rise in the marks value 
demand for marks has surged as the borders between east and west 
germany have crumbled the assumption is that liberalizations in 
east germany and elsewhere in eastern europe could make the west 
german economy boom possibly leading to higher interest rates in 
that country 
higher west german interest rates would tend to increase returns 
on markdenominated investments

markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or

benefit from the program said analyst ted mao of shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york 
us and soviet negotiators are trying to hammer out a new 
longterm grain pact the current grain pact will expire next year 
corn futures were higher due to speculative demand resulting 
from the strong surge in wheat prices mao said

the market struggled through a lackluster session with banking

wall street analysts attributed the markets sluggishness to 
investor caution ahead of fridays jobs report which is expected 
to provide a clearer picture about the outlook for interest rates 
we still havent gotten off the dime with regard to what were 
doing and where were going interest rates remain a mystery and 
what the fed is going to do said thomas walsh head of equity 
trading for nikko securities international 
people are sitting here waiting for canned book numbers and 
employment numbers each day its a new excuse not to invest he 
said 
if the data points to slower employment growth it would confirm 
mounting evidence of a slowdown in economic growth that would 
raise prospects the federal reserve would continue easing interest 
rates to stimulate growth which would help corporate earnings 
analysts said 
a government report on thirdquarter productivity and the 
federal reserves beige book summary of economic conditions was 
generally neutral for the market 
the labor department reported productivity in the nonfarm 
sector of the economy improved at an annual rate of 25 percent 
while hours worked grew at a slower 13 percent a sign of 
slackening demand for goods 
however the bond market which had been stagnant in recent 
sessions reacted negatively to the fed report which said the 
nations economy was generally stable to modestly expanding 
traders said weakness in the credit market helped depress stock 
prices 
despite the caution most analysts said the stock market showed 
signs it is working its way into a yearend rally

publishing and information services giant 
mcgrawhill inc said wednesday it was eliminating more than 1000 
jobs or 7 percent of its fulltime positions and taking a big 
charge in a restructuring to cut costs 
the company said it would take onetime pretax charges of 220 
million or 152 million after taxes in the fourth quarter for 
writing down the value of assets closing its general books unit 
and setting up a reserve for employee severance payments 
analysts said the job cuts were overdue and that the writedowns 
fit a pattern of recent refiguring of asset values in the 
publishing business 
but investors sent mcgrawhills stock down following the 
announcement in apparent disappointment at the companys 
projection of earnings for 1990 despite the charges being taken 
this year 
in new york stock exchange trading mcgrawhill closed down 2 a 
share at 6150 
the company did not specify where the job eliminations would be 
but indicated many would be corporate positions rather than in 
operating units which include business week magazine and standard 
amp poors debt rating service 
the effort to improve productivity and make the organization 
leaner is a step in the right direction said peter appert media 
analyst for cj lawrence morgan grenfell inc but he said the 
company should do more 
operating margins in some of their units are low by industry 
standards appert said citing tv station operations and some 
information services units 
he said the stock markets negative reaction to the announcement 
would do nothing to improve the companys position as a frequent 
subject of takeover speculation 
bruce thorp media analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia called the announcement one of the more decisive 
things mcgrawhill has done they have done a lot of fiddling 
with operations in the past he said 
but he said chairman joseph l dionnes statement that next 
years earnings excluding nonrecurring gains would be within a 
range of 350 to 4 a share surprised analysts who follow 
publishing companies 
its a sign that business isnt really good he said 
referring to mcgrawhill and the overall industry 
the outlook was a lot worse than anybody expected said bert 
boksen who follows mcgrawhill for raymond james amp asscoaites in 
st petersburg fla it indicates a softer than expected outlook 
for the school publishing business and a general slowing of the 
economy 
several publishing companeies recently have taken writedowns 
including harcourt brace jovanovich inc and paramount 
communications incwhich owns simon amp schuster time warner inc 
recently agreed to sell its scott foresman amp co for less than it 
paid for the unit three years ago and expects to take a pretax 
charge of 175 million on the deal 
mcgrawhill said the charges include a 145 million asset 
writedown including the shutdown of general books and writedowns 
at the data resources economic forecasting unit the company 
declined to provide figures on the size of the book unit which 
sells general interest books 
it also said it would establish a 75 million reserve for 
severance payments connected with the staff cuts 
the company said it planned to scrap its current internal 
structure of three operating companies publishing financial 
services and information services and have all operations report 
to one of two new corporate executive vice presidents reporting to 
dionne 
one new executive vice president is harold w mcgraw iii 
greatgrandson of the companys founder and now in charge of 
overseeing the financial services business week broadcasting 
aerospace and defense groups he had been head of financial 
services 
the other walter d serwatka will be responsible for the 
construction education professional publishing legal and 
computers and communications groups he had headed information 
services 
adopting this streamlined corporate structure eliminates an 
entire layer of staffing and related expenses associated with the 
three operating companies dionne said in a statement 
the rest of the jobs being eliminated will result from the 
previouslydisclosed plans to automate delivery of the fw dodge 
group reports on the construction industry and from corporate staff 
reductions spokesman stewart trisler said 
mcgrawhill currently employs about 13700 people meaning the 
reductions would amount to a 7 percent cut in staffing 
the company earned 5497 million or 113 a share on revenue 
of 5074 million in the fourth quarter of 1988 it earned 1855 
million or 383 a share on revenue of 182 billion for all of 
1988

the nations unprecedented peacetime economic 
expansion now in its eighth year will last at least three more 
years the nations top business economists said wednesday 
at the same time the federal reserve board reported current 
economic activity ranging from stable to expanding modestly 
consumer spending varies around the country it said but prices 
range from flat to increasing modestly 
the national association of business economists said the latest 
survey of its members found 62 percent expecting no recession for 
the next three years 
that expectation is a sea change according to james f 
smith the organizations president and financial professor at the 
university of north carolina 
commenting that economists rarely agree on anything smith said 
we never ever had not just a majority but an overwhelming 
majority forecasting growth over three years 
but nearly 20 percent of the 59 business economists surveyed 
said they felt a recession could occur before next april 
the economy has slowed considerably since the federal reserve 
began boosting interest rates to restrain rising prices as 
inflationary pressures moderated however the central bank has 
gradually let rates fall 
the fed in its latest survey of the economy said that the 
federal reserve districts that reported on prices generally noted 
flat to modest increases with several mentioning the continuing 
escalation of medical insurance costs 
most of its districts describe economic activity as stable to 
modestly expanding consumer spending has varied and 
strength has been mostly confined to nondurable items while 
sales of autos and other durables have generally been weak 
the central bank said that most districts reported softening in 
manufacturing and that while construction is strong or improving in 
the west and midwest it is sluggish elsewhere agriculture has 
improved in much of the country it said 
the survey by the 12 district banks is compiled by the fed every 
six weeks to prepare for meetings of the federal open market 
committee the banks monetary policysetting arm the material was 
gathered prior to nov 28 the committee is scheduled to meet dec 
18 
a senior fed official speaking to reporters after the survey 
was released said that while the automobile and housing industries 
were weak he believed the overall economy would be kept out of a 
recession by strength in other areas 
the fed official who spoke on the condition that his name not 
be used said continued growth in us exports and strength in 
sales of consumer goods other than autos should be enough to keep 
the economy moving forward in the coming year 
asked whether the fed should ease interest rates further to 
fight weakness in interestratesensitive sectors such as autos and 
housing the fed official said i think we need further evidence 
from those sectors to see whether they were responding to our past 
actions before making any further moves to ease credit 
the business economists forecast was considerably more 
optimistic than recent surves by the organization last may for 
instance 63 percent of the economists said they expected a 
recession next year three months later 37 percent still forecast 
a recession in 1990 
but the economists predicted that the gross national product 
the nations total output of goods and services will continue to 
grow slowly dropping from the 29 percent forecast for 1989 to 18 
percent next year 
smith said that since 1983 the economists have been within one 
percentage point of forecasting the following years gross national 
product 
at the same time the economists predicted further easing of 
both inflation and interest rates they said the consumer price 
index will fall from the 48 percent forecast for 1989 to 42 
percent next year 
but their report said that the slower overall growth and 
weaker industrial production is not expected to be reflected in 
higher unemployment it said unemployment would rise only from 
53 percent this year to 55 percent next year 
while they forecast improvements in the housing industry they 
saw no relief for the automobile industry next year both 
industries have been adversely affected by the feds interest rate 
policies 
and the forecasters predicted the nations twin deficits in 
merchandise trade and the federal budget would narrow but only 
very slowly 
for 1990 the trade imbalance should be about 100 billion 
which would be down from 109 billion in 1989 and federal 
spending will exceed revenue by 141 billion after a reported 
152 billion deficit in fiscal 1989 they said

allegheny international inc said wednesday a 
federal judge has approved a 625 million settlement of 
shareholders lawsuits from 1986 that accused some officers and 
directors of violating securities laws 
the settlement of derivative and classaction lawsuits will be 
funded by the officers and directors liability insurance of 
allegheny international the pittsburghbased small appliance 
manufacturer will not be required to spend any of its own money to 
satisfy claims 
under terms of the settlement approved by us district judge 
gustave diamond the company will receive 1 million decatur 
income fund inc will receive 337428 to settle its claim and all 
legal expenses and legal fees will be deducted from the gross 
amount 
the rest of the fund will be divided among investors who bought 
allegheny international common stock preferred stock and 
subordinated debentures between aug 1 1985 and april 18 1986 
class members are eligible to receive compensation if they have 
not excluded themselves from the class and file timely proofs of 
claims 
unsecured creditors meanwhile have filed a competing 
reorganization plan in us bankruptcy court for the financially 
troubled company 
the plan marks the first time any group other than the company 
has filed a reorganization plan since allegheny international lost 
its exclusive right to do so in june 
allegheny international has operated under chapter 11 of us 
bankruptcy laws for almost two years during that time the company 
proposed nine reorganization plans the latest of which was 
submitted last week 
the proposal does not specify whether assets should be sold 
although the unsecured creditors previously have called for the 
sale of the companys flagship ostersunbeam small appliance unit 
like the companys most recent proposal the creditors plan 
would repay most of allegheny internationals 740 million in debts 
with new stock its plan would issue virtually no cash to anyone 
other than trade creditors however while the companys plan would 
distribute 200 million in cash most of it to bank lenders 
those lenders would get only notes and stock under the unsecured 
creditors proposal 
unsecured creditors would become the companys majority 
stockholders and gain the right to name most directors most 
creditors would get between 48 and 755 shares of common stock in 
the reorganized company for each 1000 they are owed 
current shareholders would get only 15 percent of the 
reorganized companys shares the same as envisioned in the 
companys plan

shell oil co unveiled a plan wednesday to build 
the deepestwater oil and natural gas production platform in the 
world at a cost of about 11 billion 
the company said it was soliciting bids to build and install a 
tension leg platform in the gulf of mexico in 2860 feet of water 
which is more than half a mile deep shell said it would be a world 
waterdepth record 
the tension leg platform which employs a relatively new type of 
technology will be in the gulf about 255 miles southeast of 
houston 
last month a tension leg platform built by conoco inc in the 
gulf in 1760 feet of water was declared operational it is the 
worlds deepest oil and natural gas production platform in 
operation 
houstonbased shell a wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch 
shell in the netherlands said the cost of the auger project 
estimated at 11 billion will include fabrication and 
installation of the platform development drilling complete 
production facilities and pipelines 
the auger tlp tension leg platform represents another giant 
step toward narrowing the gap between the industrys ability to 
explore and its ability to produce said frank h richardson 
president of shell oil this project exemplifies shells 
continuing commitment to develop the technology necessary to 
produce our nations frontier oil and gas reserves 
shell said the platform will be the first gulf of mexico tension 
leg platform to support a drilling rig and complete production 
facilities 
initial development will begin about mid1990 and the drilling 
rig and production facilities will be installed in 1993 the rig 
will have 32 well slots 
the facility will be able to drill 15000 to 20000 feet 
subsea shell officials said 
production is expected to begin in 1993 and will increase to a 
projected peak rate of 40000 barrels of oil per day in 1995 and 
150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the year 2001 
a tension platform rig floats at the surface of the water and is 
connected to a foundation template on the sea floor by tubular 
steel tendons the buoyancy of the platform creates an upward force 
that puts the tendons in tension eliminating vertical motion and 
holding the platform in place

federal officials have broadened their 
investigation into the dealings of former vernon savings and loan 
association owner don d dixon his attorney said wednesday the 
same day the last of seven former officers of the thrift was 
convicted of soliciting kickbacks 
attorney william m ravkind said he received a second letter 
wednesday notifying him dixon is the target of a federal 
investigation 
ravkind would not say what areas the dallas bank fraud task 
force was investigating nor what a previous target letter had 
outlined prosecutors would not comment on the investigation 
ravkind said he expected dixon eventually would be indicted i 
dont have any way of knowing where this investigation is headed 
but i dont think theyll bring anything until theyve completed 
the entire investigation he said 
dixon currently faces no criminal charges although he is the 
lead defendant in a 540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 
1987 ravkind said that suit is on hold pending the outcome of any 
criminal investigation

warren e buffett extended his 
stockpicking prowess to champion international corp on wednesday 
as his berkshire hathaway inc bought 300000 shares of preferred 
stock for 300 million 
berkshire bought a new series of convertible stock that gives 
the omaha nebbased company about 8 percent of shareholders 
voting rights in champion a paper products company with 51 
billion in sales last year 
berkshire will have voting rights with the preferred stock 
because thats how its negotiated said champion spokesman 
robert w turner 
we are delighted to place this issue with a longterm investor 
who has such an outstanding reputation said andrew c sigler 
champions chairman and chief executive officer 
buffett is famous for buying stock in companies that turn out to 
be good longterm investments his picks include salomon brothers 
inc cocacola co gillette co and capital citiesabc inc 
the big thing about buffett is hes in for the long term 
turner said and that has been what our chairman andy sigler 
has been saying for years and years that to be competitive 
worldwide you must make capital investments over the long term 
stamfordbased champion makes paper primarily for copiers 
magazines catalogs and newspapers the company owns 64 million 
acres of timberland in the us and also makes plywood and lumber 
it is a leader in an industry that has enjoyed record profits in 
the last few years but some analysts have predicted a 6month to 
twoyear downturn in the industry because of overcapacity and a 
corresponding drop in prices 
for the three quarters ended sept 30 champion had net income 
of 3294 million on sales of 3896 billion down from a profit of 
3365 million on sales of 3814 billion in the first three 
quarters of 1988 
berkshire had a profit of 2857 million on sales of 2 billion 
last year 
champion issued the shares at 1000 each with each share 
guaranteed a dividend of 925 percent or 9250 per year turner 
said 
the stock is convertible to common stock which can reap higher 
profits but is riskier because it is not guaranteed a dividend 
the board of directors has the authority from time to time to 
issue preference stock as opposed to common stock turner said 
we have not done that very much but its being done on a 
seriesbyseries basis 
he said each preferred share carries about 263 votes or a 
total 75 million votes on all issues submitted to shareholders 
that gives berkshire about 8 percent of the voting rights based on 
91 million to 92 million shares of outstanding common stock 
berkshire agreed to limit its ownership in champion to 18 
percent for the next 10 years unless champions board approves an 
increase berkshire also agreed to certain restrictions on 
reselling the shares

the possible emergence of a third major outside 
investor in shearson lehman hutton inc could be a thorn in running 
the troubled investment firm but chairman peter cohen doesnt have 
much choice analysts said wednesday 
hes got to go somewhere to get some more capital and when you 
need more equity capital youve got to pay the price said 
securities industry analyst perrin long of lipper analytical 
services 
revlon inc chairman ronald o perelman reportedly is 
negotiating to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in shearson 
in exchange for a large stake in the brokerage firm at the same 
time the brokerage reportedly is preparing to raise up to 1 
billion through a new securities offering 
perelman would invest 250 million in exchange for a stake in 
the company of about 99 percent the new york times reported in 
thursday editions 
on wednesday the times reported that perelman would be able to 
obtain about 20 percent of shearsons stock or 175 million 
shares if he exercised all of his stock options under the deal as 
originally proposed the times said in thursday editions that the 
planned transaction was altered to make it less complex according 
to the unidentified sources it cited 
shearson spokesman michael oneil and revlon spokesman jim 
conroy declined to comment on the report in wednesdays times 
any such deal would provide needed capital for shearson which 
is 61 percent owned by american express co about 13 percent of 
shearsons stock is owned by nippon life insurance co of japan 
with the rest publicly traded 
but long said that further dividing the ownership of shearson 
among three large outsiders could prove to be a headache for 
executives under pressure to turn around the firms slumping 
profits 
a number of wall street observers have been waiting for perelman 
to make a move he had been divesting some operations and amassing 
a warchest of hundreds of millions of dollars for some time 
perelman was rebuffed two years ago in an effort to buy a block 
of stock in salomon brothers inc and some say he still wants to 
obtain a position of authority at a brokerage firm 
shearson also was said to be considering other deals such as 
obtaining more capital from american express in exchange for 
selling certain of the brokerages assets the times said the 
times said as many as seven investors had expressed interest in 
buying into the firm 
on oct 30 moodys investors service inc said it was mulling a 
possible credit rating downgrade for shearsons bonds and 
commercial paper due to the firms shearsons exposure in 
debtfinanced takeovers and a general slowdown in the securities 
industry shearson has been trying to raise capital to prevent such 
a move which would raise its borrowing costs 
a general slump in brokerage activity also has led shearson to 
realign its top management and begin a round of 800 layoffs in an 
attempt to increase profitability and cut costs 
american express has long said it wants to cut its shearson 
holding to less than 50 percent to limit its exposure to the 
vagaries of shearsons earnings 
any deal involving the sale of shearson shares could be slowed 
or blocked by nippon life which holds two seats on shearsons 
board and is its largest shareholder the deal with perelman would 
make him the secondlargest shearson shareholder other than 
american express
