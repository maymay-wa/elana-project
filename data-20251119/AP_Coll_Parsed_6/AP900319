glasnost may have come too late for east 
germanys dull dowdy newspapers and magazines 
only a few months after the revolution allowed journalists to 
switch from the communist party line to more balanced reporting 
the press faces a second upheaval west german publishers are 
trying to woo eastern readers with racy reporting and gloss 
the four mightiest representatives of west german journalism 
axel springer verlag gruener und jahr bauer and burda began 
distributing their papers and magazines throughout east germany 
this month 
gruener und jahrs hamburg headquarters said the publishers 
delivered 100000 copies on the first day of sales 
east german journalists knew when the orthodox communist 
government of erich honecker fell in october that wed be faced 
with freemarket competition that wed have to adopt more 
competitive practices said matthias schlegel deputy editor of 
the daily neue zeit 
his paper with a circulation of 150000 and a price of 20 
pfennigs 12 cents has survived only with state support 
were worried we wont be able to survive economically 
schlegel said its a real question for our existence he said 
all east german papers plan to raise prices april 1 neue zeit 
will go up to 55 pfennigs 31 cents 
east germans usually could receive west german television but 
printed material from the west was kept out for years 
then early this month the west german publishers put street 
vendors to work around east berlins alexanderplatz selling such 
journals as the masscirculation bild zeitung conservative daily 
die welt news magazines der spiegel and stern and a wide range of 
fashion and sports magazines 
roland vogel a distribution official for springer publisher of 
bildzeitung said most of the vendors were sold out by lunchtime 
every day 
for the regular vendors in the statecontrolled system its a 
different story 
we still cant sell western papers theres still been no 
agreement on prices said a man who runs a stand at the 
alexanderplatz subway station as he tidied old copies of cuba 
international and the czechoslovak motor review 
because the communistled interim government has not set the 
terms for distribution through the regular system west german 
publishers decided to use street vendors supermarkets and bakeries 
most of the western publications are priced at an exchange rate 
of three east german marks for one west german mark that means 
for example that der spiegel would cost 1350 east marks the 
equivalent of 765 
a 24yearold student who identified himself only as dieter 
said the western journals were simply too expensive for him he 
bought copies of the communist party daily neues deutschland and 
youth paper junge welt at an alexanderplatz kiosk 
juergen ludwig a railroad worker from erfurt took the opposite 
view i dont think theyre that expensive and the quality is 
definitely better especially with the magazines 
at a nearby booth jacqueline hoffmann sold subscriptions to 
berliner morgenpost a springer paper 
were offering subscriptions at 1940 marks 11 a month at a 
guaranteed 1to1 rate until currency union comes she said 
people are a bit skeptical because they dont know the paper 
but weve sold 40 subscriptions today 
economic union of the two germanys in which the west german 
mark is expected to replace the nonconvertible east german 
currency is seen as the first step toward political reunification 
east germans prefer subscriptions to buying single copies of 
papers they account for more than 90 percent of circulation for 
neue zeit schlegels paper 
resisting the western deluge will not be easy for east german 
papers most of which use old laborintensive production methods 
schlegel said there may be a spate of takeovers by west german 
press barons jockeying for market position and that small regional 
or local papers might be targets 
the east german news agency adn which surprised western 
journalists with its rapid change to fast reliable reporting is 
said to be planning a merger with the west german agency dpa 
tageszeitung a west german tabloid has set up in east berlin 
to print a separate eastern edition

even in defeat the sandinistas 
dominate the stage in nicaragua 
three weeks after the united national opposition ousted the 
sandinistas with a resounding 55 percent of the vote uno 
supporters still have not held a public celebration 
uno officials have steered cleared of the government agencies 
they must start running on april 25 they have yet to get a look at 
the books of the staterun enterprises they hope to privatize 
a couple of guys wanted to go down to the ministries but i 
told them no you could get killed said labor leader alvin 
guthrie a uno deputyelect to the national assembly i told them 
just be prudent take it easy 
president daniel ortega has been sending mixed signals in speech 
after speech saying the sandinistas will defend the gains of the 
revolution while giving up power while presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro has been virtually invisible 
the shape of her cabinet and her policies are still unclear as 
is the balance of power in her 14party coalition mrs chamorro 
60 has had only one short news conference since the feb 25 
general election 
ortega has been at the forefront issuing warnings of 
insurrection and civil war one day then calmly assuring vice 
president dan quayle that the sandinistas will give up power 
a climate of uncertainty and impatience prevails despite the 
lifting last week of the us economic embargo that had severed 
nicaragua from its traditional markets and strangled its sources of 
credit 
by the end of the week a us dollar fetched 120000 cordobas 
the nicaraguan currency on the black market thats nearly double 
the black market rate in the weeks just before the election and 
more than double the 54000 official rate 
the business community although buoyed by the end of the 
fiveyear embargo and a 300 million aid package president bush is 
requesting from congress is cautious 
after the 25th has become a kind of refrain in business 
circles 
in their waning days of exclusive power the sandinistas have 
been at turns threatening defensive contrite and conciliatory 
all eyes are upon them as they prepare to govern from below 
simultaneously maneuvering for position in transition talks with 
uno shoring up their power base and taking steps to block any 
conservative counterreforms 
they have handed out thousands of guns rallied their rank and 
file passed an amnesty covering a decade of revolutionary rule and 
drafted a law legalizing the confiscations of thousands of homes 
farms and vehicles 
nothing of substance has emerged publicly from the transition 
talks where dismantling ussupported contra rebels and control 
of the army police and state security apparatus are critical 
issues 
but the sandinistas have made it clear that while they may give 
up the government they wont give up their guns 
in his most troubling speech to date ortega said that if the 
contras havent demobilized by april 25 the day uno is scheduled 
to take over the country would rise up in arms 
it is like the calm before the storm he said we have to 
avoid being crushed by the tempest of civil war popular 
insurrection violence 
the contras for their part continue to insist they wont put 
down their weapons until mrs chamorro is in office and they feel 
its safe to return from their base camps in honduras 
were going to remain at arms to guarantee that the people get 
everything people vote for a change in the government and a 
change in their lives said contra field commander denis galeano 
conejo 
ortega has also said that people ready to defend the conquests 
of the revolution which the sandinistas define as everything 
from milk for children to confiscated property to government jobs 
experience has taught the sandinistas who took power in the 
1979 revolution that ended the somoza family dictatorship how to 
function as a clandestine movement and what it is like hold the 
reins of power 
now they must learn a new role an opposition party sandinistas 
insiders admit it is a part they were not expecting to play 
any other political party in any other part of the world would 
not have gone to elections early said ray hooker a sandinista 
deputy in the national assembly it was a kind of hubris on our 
part 
part of the adjustment appears to be taking place in ortegas 
wardrobe 
he showed up at the inauguration of chiles president patricio 
alywin last week in a dark suit and tie a contrast to the 
technicolor shirts he wore on the campaign trail and an even 
greater contrast to the uniforms he wore for years to symbolize his 
countrys mobilization against the contras 
despite defeat the sandinistas are wellpositioned to block the 
complete dismantling of their leftist revolution 
although uno won a 52seat majority in the 92seat national 
assembly it is three seats short of the number it needs to amend 
the constitution 
the sandinistas also will maintain control of the supreme court 
which would hear any challenges to the constitution until 1993 
halfway through mrs chamorros term 
there will be a permanent process of negotiation said 
alfredo cesar chamorros principle adviser 
uno officials fear the sandinistas are quietly gutting public 
institutions and will leave them nothing but the shell of a state 
structure 
vice president sergio ramirez heatedly denied the suggestion 
last week he said audits were under way in all public institutions 
and challenged anyone with proof of wrongdoing to present it to the 
republics controller and attorney general 
we believe these slanderous and irresponsible accusations are 
not contributing to an orderly and peaceful climate for the 
transfer of government he said

when igor lukashuk opens an american law book he 
sees the future of the soviet union 
lukashuk a prominent international law expert hopes his 
research on american constitutional law carefully recorded in a 
big black notebook will act as a catalyst in shaping his countrys 
new political system 
the future communist party will be like your system the 
63yearold muscovite said it would suit us perfectly a two 
party system two parties that are different but really the same 
lukashuk is teaching soviet law at emory university in a newly 
established visiting professorship believed to be the first time a 
soviet academic institution is staffing an american university on a 
continual basis 
it took two years of negotiations and a letter from former 
president jimmy carter urging soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to 
endorse the program but the professorship was established last 
fall with the institute of state and law of the ussr academy of 
sciences 
lukashuk a frequent united nations delegate welcomed the 
chance to study how typical americans are treated by their 
political system 
but he spends most of his time answering questions from crowds 
of students and journalists who flock to his office rather than 
asking them an enthusiastic i explain you why punctuates his 
conversations 
all the time people ask me about gorbachev if im a 
communist said the longtime communist party member 
i believe in gorbachev hes a gifted man he added but 
according to marxism socialism develops due to contradictions but 
there are no contradictions with only one party 
lukashuk is asked frequently how he likes the united states he 
is careful not to criticize but will say he thinks americans are a 
little too arrogant 
i cant agree with your president that the world needs the 
leadership of the us he explained tomorrow will be a 
welfare world its not possible to make a secure world if the us 
is inventing butter without fat while other people are starving 
lukashuk is also critical of the soviet political system hes 
trying to change saying it destroyed his countrys economy and 
contributed to ethnic violence in armenia and azerbaijan and calls 
for independence by the baltic republics 
for five years we supported perestroika but still we must 
eat he said they must make the first steps so that in 
february it is just a bit better than january 
making gorbachevs policy of perestroika or restructuring work 
lies in finding out what makes systems such as those of the united 
states and great britain work lukashuk said thats his goal 
and even though he says he can do more research in atlanta in 
three months than in moscow in a year hes having a hard time 
fitting work into his schedule people keep calling asking for 
interviews or inviting him to parties lukashuk said he just cant 
turn anyone down especially not students 
they are understandable in law understandable in life of 
humor jokes lukashuk said i must say they are more sincere 
more open than students in other countries they are the future of 
the world community

in the old days east germans never dared 
step on the huge lawn in front of communist party headquarters the 
ominous center of power where 2000 functionaries controlled every 
detail of national life 
after the ouster of the hardline leaders last fall east 
berliners began to reclaim the grass for picnics and sunbathing 
sightseers would casually stroll up the steps of the huge gray 
sevenstory building 
now in the final transition from dictatorship to democracy the 
party is moving out of what was known as the house of the 
thousand telephones 
the former communist fortress will now provide office space for 
the 400 members of parliament elected sunday in east germanys 
first free vote the deadline for moving out is april 1 
today few reminders are left of the once omnipotent party 
silence has descended on the 820 rooms and miles upon miles of 
linoleumlined corridors that once bustled with bureaucrats 
the bronze busts of karl marx and friedrich engels that guarded 
the inner portals have been carted up to the attic where they 
joined discarded postersized official photographs of ousted 
party chief erich honecker 
the 16foothigh oval party emblem on the right side of the 
facade was removed by workers in january after the communists 
pledged reform and renamed themselves the party of democratic 
socialism 
the reformed party as a symbol of change has decorated the 
facade with rows of colorful paintings by west berlin artists 
during the election party on sunday children romped through the 
grand hall on the ground floor as their parents drank beer and 
cheered the new party leaders reformers gregor gysi and prime 
minister hans modrow 
the old party apparatus has been smashed and now people 
actually like to come here and enjoy themselves said sylvia 
graefe 39 a party archivist speaking in her small basement office 
only six months ago the closely guarded party fortress 
symbolized how isolated the ruling regime had become from the 
population after 41 years of totalitarian rule 
honecker and the 20 other members of the ruling politburo 
occupied offices on the second floor to which only selected 
employees had access even they needed special identification cards 
with two red stripes and had to pass numerous security guards 
before reaching the inner sanctum 
mrs graefe recalled that ordinary party workers would sometimes 
be called up to the second floor to provide a cheering section for 
foreign visitors a practice that employees referred to as the 
clapping detail 
five minutes before the visitor arrived honecker would emerge 
from his room and make a little small talk with us maybe talk 
about the weather when the visitor came honecker would embrace 
him we clapped and then the two disappeared into honeckers 
office she said 
the leaders of the party that espoused equality and brotherhood 
always remained aloof from the rankandfile communists said mrs 
graefe 
politburo members used a private woodpaneled elevator while 
party employees moved up and down in a crude elevator without 
doors politburo members lunched in an executive dining room on the 
seventh floor while mrs graefe and others stood in line with 
plastic trays in the groundfloor cafeteria 
party official jutta boehm who for 10 years headed the 
politburos typing pool blamed the selfimposed isolation of the 
77yearold honecker and his ruling clique of old men for the 
collapse of the regime 
if they had been a little more accessible things would be 
different today said mrs boehm 
the partys membership has shrunk from 25 million to about 
600000 since october

occasionally an art theft reads like the plot 
from an ian fleming thriller in which halfmad billionaires pay 
slick international thieves to steal famous paintings for their 
private pleasure 
in reality experts said monday most art is stolen to earn a 
quick buck in an international black market that is second in size 
only to the drug trade 
the priceless art stolen sunday from the isabella stewart 
gardner museum is too famous to be sold anywhere raising the 
spectre that the pieces could be held hostage for ransom for a 
fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars the art world says 
the paintings are worth 
the true scale of the art underworld is difficult to gauge but 
investigators say art thievery is increasing as prices for works on 
the legal market soar 
theres a lot of it going on said robert w holmes jr a 
boston attorney specializing in fine art transactions ninety 
percent of stolen art is never recovered theres obviously a 
market there 
rarely one end of the market is held up by someone who decides 
to commission the theft of a painting that cannot be legitimately 
acquired 
one such theft occurred in 1983 when thieves stole italian 
renaissance masterpieces including raphaels self portrait from 
the hungarian national museum in budapest 
investigators found that a sophisticated band of italian art 
thieves armed with cutting tools and hightech alarmbusting 
devices executed a perfect breakin and vanished with the works 
an extensive dragnet eventually snared the thieves in their home 
country before they could get the paintings to greece where it was 
later found an olive oil baron had paid a handsome sum for the 
sake of having the works hang in his home 
there arent many thieves with that sort of expertise said 
robert volpe a former new york city police detective who worked on 
the hungarian case and is now a private consultant tracing stolen 
art around the world they were capable of stealing anything 
but most of the black market in art is in lesserknown works 
usually ranging in value from 100000 to 300000 priceless works 
such as the vermeer taken from the gardner museum are simply too 
famous to be sold anywhere 
its incredibly stupid to steal a vermeer or a rembrandt 
said steven keller a private security consultant who was brought 
in as security director at the art institute of chicago after a 
major theft of three works there by cezanne in 1979 
he the gardner thief has got some things that are too hot to 
handle keller said 
keller said lesserknown works and prints that could be sold 
more easily were more valuable to thieves than masterworks that 
couldnt be fenced 
you might be able to sell say a lesserknown american 
artists painting in europe keller said its harder to spot 
them 
often thieves who cant sell stolen art underground hold it 
ransom for insurance money a scenario several investigators and 
curators said was likely in the gardner theft 
last year for instance thieves stole three paintings by van 
gogh demanded a 22 million ransom and returned one of the works 
the others were later recovered and four people suspected of the 
theft were arrested 
it happens and it happens frequently holmes said but 
like any hostage situation its got to be outside the public eye 
so often these cases go unnoticed 
keller noting the relative worth of the art stolen from the 
gardner museum said if i were the thief of the gardner 
paintings id ship the vermeer and the rembrandt back to the 
museum and go for a ransom on the smaller works

miniature ultrasound probes inserted into the 
body are taking the first 3d pictures of the hearts arteries 
providing highly detailed images of clogged and damaged vessels to 
help doctors fix them researchers report 
the developers of the technique will present preliminary results 
of their tests to a meeting of the american academy of cardiology 
on tuesday 
this is potentially an extremely powerful tool said one of 
the researchers dr kenneth rosenfield of st elizabeths hospital 
in boston 
the pictures clearly show cracks and breaks in the artery wall 
bulges of fatty deposits and the layers of tissue that surround the 
blood vessel 
the development of threedimensional images appears to be a 
significant improvement on the stillexperimental use of 
insidethebody ultrasound probes to take pictures of ailing 
arteries 
that technique which is only about 2 years old has been used 
to make twodimensional pictures of cross sections of blood 
vessels even with its limitations doctors often describe this 
approach as a fantastic voyage for its ability to give the 
illusion that they are traveling inside of blood vessels 
the twodimensional images are simple slices of the artery that 
resemble pictures of donuts the d pictures have depth of field 
on a tv screen doctors can look down the artery examine the 
muscle that surrounds it or even open it up and explore the rough 
snaking surface that blood flows over 
the pictures can be rotated side to side or end to end to give 
doctors the best perspective on the contours they need to smooth 
away or work around 
with this extra information the boston doctors believe that 
cardiologists will be able to do a better job diagnosing the 
specific irregularities that interfere with blood flow so they can 
repair circulation to the heart and other parts of the body 
it will enable us we hope to get better results and 
ultimately make patients suffer less said rosenfield we want 
to make successful procedures out of ones that once would have been 
failures 
the system was created by computer software developers at 
imagecomm systems in santa clara calif in consultation with the 
st elizabeths doctors 
when the arteries that feed the heart become clogged the 
reduced flow of blood causes chest pain known as angina doctors 
routinely treat this condition with angioplasty in this technique 
a miniature balloon is blown up and then deflated inside the artery 
to push away the deposits the arteries however often clog again 
within a few months and doctors are working on even more 
aggressive cleaning techniques that they hope will keep blood 
flowing for years 
these procedures involve using lasers to burn away the deposits 
or whirling knives to scrape them off specialists say the 3d 
pictures may be especially useful for guiding these new tools 
because they will enable doctors to judge how deeply they can cut 
and burn without breaking through the artery walls 
to make the image the doctor first inserts a thin tube through 
the circulatory system into the hearts arteries the tube is 
tipped with ultrasoundproducing crystals as the doctor slowly 
pulls the crystals through the artery they snap five ultrasound 
pictures per second 
then a computer stacks the crosssection pictures on top of 
each other like the slices in a loaf of bread the computer makes 
assumptions about what lies in the spaces between each slice the 
result is a continuous picture of the artery 
currently the pictures must be processed on imagecomms 
computers in california but the developers predict that within a 
few months doctors should be able to have live 3d pictures as 
they work on patients in their hospitals 
terry laas imagecomms sales director said his company created 
the 3d process at the request of dr jeffrey m isner and other 
heart specialists at st elizabeths 
they are the brains behind this whole process said laas 
they knew want they wanted to accomplish and just asked the right 
questions

a package bomb left in front of an 
apartment exploded when it was picked up monday night killing a 
70yearold man police said 
the man was reportedly returning to his apartment with his wife 
and daughter when the incident occurred at about 8 pm the blast 
was powerful enough to destroy the roof overhand of the twostory 
apartment building police said 
at first the family stepped over the package and went inside 
their firstfloor apartment authorities said 
he came back out picked it up and it exploded said 
police spokesman steve weintraub 
the victim identified as sherwin finley was airlifted to 
university hospital where he was pronounced dead a short while 
later his wife dorothy 67 and 35yearold daughter were not 
injured 
according to witnesses the package resembled a shoebox and was 
wrapped in brown paper it was not sent through the mail 
he opened it and when he did two tremendous explosions 
happened at the same time said witness ken ames it just blew 
him jumping backwards and all the debris started to fall 
weintraub said finley had worked for the department of road 
engineering in missouri and moved with his family into the 
apartment complex on dec 1 neighbors knew little about them 
i dont know if theyre down here to see if they wanted to 
live here or what weintraub said 
police had no suspects or motive for the bombing the fbi was 
investigating but had no comment late monday

an agreement to end a fiveday 
antiabortion filibuster in the state senate apparently unraveled 
monday as both sides held firm in the debate over an 
abortionrights bill 
the agreement had been announced late sunday by senate president 
thomas v mike miller the democrat had said it was acceptable to 
32 senators enough to pass a motion of cloture that would end the 
filibuster which began thursday 
both sides however said the agreement was based on a 
misunderstanding over a compromise proposed by an antiabortion 
legislator the misunderstanding became apparent only when 
negotiators attempted to put the finishing touches to it 
negotiating teams meet several times monday morning but the 
talks were suspended in the afternoon when both sides refused to 
budge from their positions the antiabortion senators insisted 
they were prepared to carry on the debate indefinitely 
we proposed a very reasonable compromise said democratic 
sen thomas p oreilly a staunch abortion opponent we feel 
very strongly about it 
democratic sen barbara a hoffman a leading abortion rights 
senator said her forces were not about to give in either 
were just getting more determined she said the other 
side offered something that wasnt a compromise 
antiabortion forces thought they had obtained an agreement in 
principle from the prochoice side to an unusual proposal by 
oreilly that would have put the abortion issue on a referendum in 
november 
oreilly suggested that the general assembly pass a measure that 
would effectively include two bills a prochoice measure that 
would go into effect immediately and a second more restrictive 
section favored by antiabortion senators 
underlying that proposal was the assumption that any bill 
approved and signed into law would immediately be challenged and 
wind up in a referendum 
under the proposal if the voters rejected the first section 
the second the restrictive one automatically would become law 
abortion rights legislators said monday they hadnt gone along 
with the twotier bill but that the other side had mistakenly 
thought they had they acknowledged however the suggestion was 
being considered in mondays talks 
its a twotier system or nothing oreilly said the 
citizens of maryland deserve a choice 
i have no problem with the approach as long as i can write 
section one i also want to write section two said 
democratic sen walter m baker who is leading the prochoice 
negotiating team 
baker said the two sides have been unable to agree on how 
abortions would be regulated in each of the two sections 
the original bill was drafted in expectation that the us 
supreme court will overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortions 
the bill would allow unrestricted abortions until a fetus is 
able to survive outside the womb after fetal viability is reached 
abortions would be allowed only to save a womans life or protect 
her health 
negotiators said the postviability question was another serious 
obstacle to an agreement 
abortion rights activists want a law that would allow such 
abortions to protect a womans mental health as well as to save 
her life or protect her physical health 
antiabortionists would like to restrict postviability 
abortions to those necessary to save the life of the mother or at 
the most to protect her physical health

one of every five house members traveled 
abroad during the last three months of 1989 visiting at least 60 
locations at a cost to taxpayers of about 1 million 
recently released records show that 87 members including two 
nonvoting delegates traveled abroad between oct 1 and dec 31 
1989 well over 100 staff members also went overseas 
the delegations went to some of the finest cities in europe to 
the third world and in the case of two house appropriations 
committee staffers to antarctica to study research projects 
staffers who travel with members said the workload on a trip can 
vary with the delegation leader 
the staff of rep stephen j solarz house foreign affairs 
subcommittee works on a rotation schedule because their boss wears 
them out 
we have a working breakfast at 730 am three meetings 
before lunch a working lunch two or three meetings in the 
afternoon cocktails with one group and a working dinner with 
another said stanley roth staff director of the new york 
democrats subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs thats a 
pretty basic day 
however one house staff member said staffers refer to some 
lawmakers as wcs or world class shoppers 
this source who spoke on condition of anonymity recalled a 
member once asking why the hell did you allow the meeting to go 
after 6 oclock the stores are closed 
the house records show the cost of the trips was at least 
971000 from october through december but reports still not filed 
could push the total to more than 1 million 
many members flew in firstclass commercial seats while larger 
delegations used military jets maintained at andrews air force 
base in suburban maryland for federal executives and members of 
congress 
one farranging trip last november and december took a house 
armed services committee delegation to morocco egypt jordan 
oman bahrain and portugal in 11 days 
the delegation met a king a sultan and a president they ate 
pigeon saw the pyramids and cruised the nile but these pleasures 
were mingled with hours of embassy briefings meetings with foreign 
officials and banquets 
by the end of the trip members and staffers were saying it 
was like the bataan death march said rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo who organized the trip as chairman of the armed services 
subcommittee on military installations 
schroeder said 18hour days were the norm on her trip adding 
there were no golf clubs no tanning clinics the food was 
very good but i dont think we ever sat down to a dinner that was 
less than three hours long 
although schroeder freely discussed the perks along with the 
workload of her trip lawmakers generally react defensively about 
travel 
rep mervin dymally dcalif who took three trips from october 
to december that landed him in africa europe south america and 
asia responded to an inquiry about his travel by preparing a 
report on his mission 
dymally chairman of the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
international operations said he was studying diplomatic 
security antiterrorism construction of new buildings 
acquisition of sites and the controversy surrounding the moscow 
embassy which was never occupied by us diplomats because it 
was found to be filled with listening devices 
some members were frequent fliers during the last three months 
of 1989 
rep eni f h faleomavaega the democratic nonvoting delegate 
from american samoa went to new zealand in november to discuss 
fishing issues he traveled to jamaica in november to discuss 
caribbean economic matters then it was on to panama nicaragua and 
el salvador in october to assess current events in those countries 
dymally went to the gambia the united kingdom and france in one 
october trip and two weeks later traveled to venezuela suriname 
curacao haiti and guyana he also went in december to japan south 
korea taiwan and hong kong 
not all members experiences are pleasant 
schroeder said her delegation complained to moroccan officials 
about that countrys cancellation of a military exercise with the 
united states and the postponement of parliamentary elections 
the delegation which included reps william l dickinson 
rala andy ireland rfla and solomon p ortiz dtexas felt 
like the skunks at the garden party schroeder said

a teenager taking drugs is three times more 
likely to attempt suicide than nondrug users suggesting that 
marijuana alcohol and other drugs play a powerful role in suicide 
among the young according to a new study 
theres no question that the drugs themselves can lead to 
depressive effects that lead to suicide attempts said dr 
richard h schwartz a vienna va pediatrician who coauthored 
the study among the youth the more easily obtainable is the 
drug the greater the adverse effects suicide attempts increase 
dramatically 
the study by schwartz and by alan l berman a member of the 
psychology department faculty at american university is published 
this month in the american journal of diseases of children 
suicide is the third leading cause of death among americans aged 
15 to 24 and in virginia where schwartz practices suicide is the 
second leading cause of death among this age group 
schwartz said his study involved testing and questioning of 298 
adolescent patients in four treatment centers he identified as 
being in three separate areas east of the mississippi river 
twothirds of those surveyed admitted they had thoughts about 
committing suicide and 89 or 30 percent said they had made 
actual suicide attempts 
earlier studies said schwartz shows that only 6 percent to 7 
percent of the general adolescent population attempts suicide 
schwartz said the patients in his study were between 13 and 19 
years of age ninetythree percent were white and 66 percent were 
male 
the most popular drug among the group was marijuana with 
alcohol a distant second but other drugs such as crack cocaine 
angel dust and lsd also were used 
among those who attempted suicide 40 percent said they made the 
attempt within eight hours after using drugs 
schwartz said though there probably are multiple factors 
that lead to suicide attempts he believes the higher number of 
attempts among drug users may be attributed to the depressive 
effects of some drugs or to the low that develops after using 
drugs such as cocaine or crack 
some drugs in and of themselves have depressive effects 
alcohol does and so does pcp angel dust and lsd said 
schwartz for drugs that are stimulants such as crack or cocaine 
the depression is a rebound they go up very high and the higher 
the high the lower the low 
most of the suicide attempts were of low lethality said 
schwartz with 61 percent requiring no medical attention but 10 
percent tried to kill themselves at the wheel of a car and 8 
percent tried to hang themselves 
about 15 percent of those who attempted suicide spent time 
in intensive care said schwartz these were not superficial 
wrist slashings but serious attempts that could have resulted in 
death without prompt medical care 
schwartz said he and berman were astounded to learn that 23 
percent of those who tried to kill themselves said their families 
still kept firearms and ammunition around the home after the 
suicide attempt 
you cannot keep weapons at home like that if there is an 
adolescent on drugs you can assume a one in nine chance of 
multiple suicide attempts so you need to get rid of firearms 
said schwartz among successful suicides theres a growing 
tendency to use firearms

faye dunaway says her memorable portrayal of 
joan crawford in the 1981 film mommie dearest was one of the 
big mistakes of her career 
i shouldnt have done the crawford role dunaway said in the 
april issue of fame my actor friends feel it was a real 
performance but in fact it was carried too far and it got too 
camp 
her latest role is that of the wealthy but sterile wife of a 
military leader in the handmaids tale 
she recently moved to los angeles from new york with her 
9yearold son and plans to begin producing her own projects for 
film and television 
when older men star in movies they have love affairs with 
much younger women said the 49yearold actress look at paul 
newman in his movies i dont think its fair 
its in the eyes of the people who are making the movies and 
its in society too which equates desirability with youth the 
only answer is to produce the movies yourself believe in the 
roles and fight for them

jane pauleys popularity has soared since her 
departure from the today show and that has her worried 
most tv stars are larger than life she said in the march 26 
issue of newsweek but my guess is that viewers identify with me 
rather than stand back and admire so you dont want to pump me up 
to be a great big star because then youve changed me this could 
be tricky 
pauley will be substituting for nbc nightly news anchor tom 
brokaw for three weeks this spring when he goes on vacation and nbc 
has scheduled five specials for her this summer as a dry run for a

less than a year and a half after proclaiming 
himself at the end of a long political journey ronald reagan 
is back on the campaign trail 
the former republican president is putting his popularity to 
work for gop candidates running for congress and state 
legislatures as some expresidents have done before him 
already reagan has helped with fund raising for state gop 
organizations in georgia and washington for senate candidates in 
indiana and iowa and for sen pete wilsons gubernatorial bid in 
california 
and although he normally commands speaking fees of 30000 or 
more reagan accepts no pay for his party appearances spokesman 
mark weinberg said 
reagan campaigning on nov 5 1988 for george bush told a 
national radio audience were now at the end of a long political 
journey that marks for me the end of my last campaign as an 
officeholder 
still reagan intends to be out there for fellow republicans 
this year weinberg said 
gop leaders are delighted to have the expresidents help 
when the georgia republican party announced that reagan would 
speak at its annual presidents day lunch in atlanta on feb 10 
the response was just phenomenal said bill thorn the partys 
executive director it was not a hard sell at all 
nearly 2000 people turned out bringing in more than 200000 
a few weeks later reagan traveled a few blocks from his los 
angeles office to speak at a private fundraising lunch for iowa 
gop senate candidate rep thomas j tauke the lunch attracted 
about 45 people who each contributed 500 or in some cases 1000 
combining politics with a paycheck reagan pulled in about 
40000 for washington republicans in december by making brief 
remarks and posing for photographs at a private reception while he 
was in seattle to deliver a paid speech to business executives 
for wilson the former president spoke at fundraisers in the 
los angeles area and in san diego reagan also lent his signature 
to a fundraising letter for sen dan coats of indiana several 
months ago 
right now we are helping coordinate a political plan which is 
geared toward all of the various things that he can do to be 
helpful particularly in the target races said leslie goodman 
spokeswoman for the republican national committee 
former president richard nixon an increasing presence on the 
political scene has agreed to work with us as well ms 
goodman said 
nixon who resigned in 1974 under threat of impeachment because 
of the watergate scandal made a handful of campaign appearances 
over the last decade and has received a number of requests for 
appearances this year according to his assistant john taylor 
sitting out the 1990 campaign will be former president and house 
gop leader gerald ford but not by choice said his spokesman bob 
barrett ford has a knee operation scheduled for this fall 
the only surviving democratic president jimmy carter is not 
expected to take part in the 1990 campaign 
his work is here at the carter center and is generally pretty 
apolitical said carrie harmon a spokeswoman for carter in 
atlanta 
he has certainly played a different role than reagan has or 
than ford has since he left office said anita dunn 
communications director for the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee he has done some fundraising for democrats but he 
has not been a really prominent campaigner 
in years past former president harry s truman campaigned for 
democratic candidates from 1952 when he left office until he was 
disabled by a stroke in 1966 according to archivist dennis s 
bilger of the truman library in independence mo 
the last republican president before reagan to serve eight 
years dwight eisenhower never went out on the circuit after

robert caro can understand why some lyndon 
johnson supporters are unhappy with with the second of a 
fourvolume series on the former presidents life 
caro also felt disappointed i really thought i was going to 
love him said caro author of the years of lyndon johnson 
means of ascent 
when i started on the series i thought he was like former 
new york gov al smith there were great similarities they were 
both very uneducated physically unattractive said caro who 
wrote of smith in the pulitzer prizewinning the power broker 
robert moses and the fall of new york 
but al smith while he was a ruthless politician i thought 
smiths motivating drive underneath was his desire to help his 
people like the irish immigrants said caro who has spent 14 
years studying johnsons life i had the same image of lyndon 
johnson when i started and it was an image that died hard 
what caro claims to have discovered was that johnson was a 
selfcentered politician obsessed with power willing to do 
anything steal a us senate election wildly exaggerate his war 
record even risk his life to advance himself 
caros first volume the years of lyndon johnson the path to 
power was published in 1982 and also riled some johnson 
supporters 
former johnson aide jack valenti has accused caro of being 
passionately bent on destroying the late presidents 
reputation bob hardesty a johnson speechwriter who helped him 
write his memoirs called caros biography dishonest 
i dont think it pretends to be fair i think it is the work 
of a man with a burning unnatural hatred for his subject 
hardesty said 
caro denied bias he said his assertions are supported by books 
newspapers court documents files obtained from the johnson 
library and by interviews with johnsons widow lady bird and 
others 
means of ascent published by alfred a knopf begins with 
johnsons narrow defeat for the us senate in 1941 and ends in 
1948 when johnson beat former texas gov coke stevenson by 87 votes 
in a senate race long suspected of having been stolen 
caro said that ballot boxes were stuffed and votes altered 
i really believe that no fairminded person can ever doubt 
again that the election was stolen caro insisted and not with 
87 votes or 200 votes but with thousands of votes it was not 
simply something that everybody did this went further 
the amazing thing to me is that there was doubt for so many 
years when you start reading the court transcripts witness after 
witness testifies the same way 
caro also said that johnson portrayed himself as a warscarred 
veteran of many battles on many fronts but actually saw combat 
in the south pacific only as an observer and for a total of 13 
minutes 
he wrote of a man who frequently humiliated lady bird had a 
lengthy affair with a publishers wife and campaigned despite 
potentially lifethreatening kidney stones that caused fever and 
excruciating pain 
caro agreed with his critics that his subject comes across 
unfavorably but said he felt compassion for him referring to 
johnsons painful experiences growing up when his family was in 
poverty 
i tell you there are times when you really do feel like 
crying caro said 
caro said more positive qualities that johnson displayed as a 
senator and then as president will be depicted in upcoming volumes 
a johnson person might say what is this where is the rest 
of lyndon johnson the third volume when hes passing civil 
rights legislation takes hundreds of pages and you really see him 
doing something noble 
he had those elements in him great gifts an empathy for 
really the disadvantaged in society and a matchless gift for 
mobilizing the powers of government

meteorologists have been enjoying spring for a 
few weeks now while calendarwatchers are only now about to catch 
up with them 
the first day of spring is one thing and the first spring day 
is another the difference between them is sometimes as great as a 
month observed the late henry van dyke of princeton university 
calendars proclaim march 20 as the first day of spring but 
to weather and climate professionals spring arrived on march 1 
whos right 
there has always been a division of opinion as to where to 
place the boundaries and the middles of the four seasons reports 
guy ottewell in the astronomical companion 
in one system the equinoxes and solstices that mark the movement 
of the sun are considered seasonal boundaries while other systems 
consider those dates to be seasonal midpoints he says 
and while the federal government has managed to regulate most 
aspects of life in one way or another even putting three different 
federal agencies in charge of time there is no bureau of the 
seasons 
climatologists simply divide the year into four threemonth 
seasons with spring arriving each march 1 
the popular perception of spring beginning on march 20 is based 
on the decision reached about a century ago by calendar printers to 
mark the seasons with the dates of the solstices and equinoxes 
in those days calendar makers usually printed almanacs too and 
those featured the movement of the sun moon and stars that made 
it convenient to designate spring as beginning with a special date 
the vernal equinox 
thats the date when daylight and darkness are nearly equal as 
the sun crosses the equator on its apparent trip north it occurs 
on tuesday afternoon this year 
that system of dividing the seasons apparently originated about 
70 bc with the astronomer geminus of rhodes 
spring by the calendar method lasts until the summer solstice 
the northernmost point reached by the sun which comes june 21 
this year 
that day the first day of summer for many americans is known 
as midsummer in much of europe and great bonfires and celebrations 
are held on midsummers night 
richard inwards a leader of englands royal meteorological 
society late in the last century said the use of the solstices and 
equinoxes to mark seasons was illogical 
more reasonable he believed was the system used in the middle 
ages in europe using saints days to mark the seasons spring by 
that reckoning begins on st peters day feb 21 and lasts until 
may 24 
the medieval reckoning of summer lasting from may 25 to aug 23 
helps explain why june 21 the first day of summer on american 
calendars is known as midsummers day in europe 
using the equinoxes and solstices as midpoints of seasons means 
the seasons begin on what are known as the crossquarter days 
between the solstices and equinoxes ottewell reports 
by that reckoning spring began on groundhog day feb 2 and is 
now about half over 
many astronomers consider spring the first season and in ancient 
times it marked the new year rather than having that celebration in 
midwinter as is done now 
for the record the three federal agencies keeping track of time 
are the us naval observatory which operates atomic clocks the 
national institute of standards and technology which defines the 
exact length of units of time and the department of 
transportation which is in charge of the changes from standard to 
daylight time and back again that next occurs on april 1

efforts to ban semiautomatic assault weapons 
speed up appeals in death penalty cases and permit searches without 
warrants are generating new heat in the senate as lawmakers brace 
for an electionyear anticrime debate 
we cannot win the drug fight without tough criminal laws 
sen orrin hatch rutah said of the legislation which the senate 
is expected to tackle soon now that members are returning from last 
weeks recess 
the bill began in the senate as an anticrime package 
recommended by president bush 
majority democrats however made major changes and the 
administration opposes the bill being brought to the floor by 
judiciary committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel 
but republicans still hope it can be retailored to suit white 
house tastes 
divisions are so deep that few if any senators would be 
shocked to see the bill filibustered to death conservatives wince 
at the notion of adding more guncontrol legislation while senate 
liberals have little stomach for expanding use of the death penalty 
no matter how brutal the crime a person has committed the 
infliction of death at the hands of government brutalizes our 
society says sen edward m kennedy dmass the death penalty 
is a dead end in the war on crime 
both bidens bill and a gop rival sponsored by sen strom 
thurmond rsc would reinstate the death penalty for 30 federal 
crimes including assassination of the president such a law has 
been on the books for decades but supreme court decisions in the 
1970s blocked courts from imposing death in those cases 
both bills also would set deadlines for death row inmates to 
file federal appeals or forfeit their right to do so the idea is 
to prevent delays that sometimes drag out for a decade 
the result is a criminal justice system which is overburdened 
with piecemeal and repetitious litigation and years of delay 
between sentencing and a final judicial resolution of the criminal 
matter thurmond says 
but critics say defendants should have the maximum chance to 
avoid being sent to the execution chamber contending the death 
sentence is sometimes applied in a haphazard or discriminatory 
manner 
the democratic proposal would allow a second round of appeals 
for any prisoner victimized by a miscarriage of justice on his 
first try 
kennedy also wants to allow those awaiting execution to argue 
that capital punishment was imposed on them as part of a 
statistical pattern of bias against minorities 
but hatch contends the provision is transparently designed to 
abolish the death penalty in all cases and that would kill the 
crime bill without a doubt 
meanwhile republicans want to allow courts in some cases to 
admit evidence obtained in searches carried out without warrants if 
police acted in good faith 
the democratic bill primarily echoes the latest supreme court 
ruling on this exclusionary rule which allows courts in some 
circumstances to admit evidence obtained in a flawed manner but 
not without a warrant 
democrats also want to widen the opportunity for defendants to 
get evidence thrown out of court 
manufacture sale and possession of nine types of semiautomatic 
assault weapons would be banned under the biden bill the american 
rifle association has been lobbying against the provision and 
there is speculation that it would lead to a filibuster unless 
dropped 
republicans propose to ban domestic assembly of foreignmade 
assault weapons already barred from import into the united states 
and outlaw clips of more than 15 bullets 
bidens bill also would create an independent organized crime 
and dangerous drug division in the justice department this would 
effectively overturn a decision by attorney general dick thornburgh 
that gave local us attorneys control over the departments 
vaunted organized crime strike forces

for east german voters its not just 
unification that lies over the rainbow its western prosperity as 
well 
that was the main message from sundays historic free elections 
which gave the conservatives a huge and unexpected win 
born in church basements where young activists once met to hide 
from the despised secret police the peaceful revolution that 
ousted hardline communist rulers five months ago quickly lost its 
innocence and idealism 
after unleashing tens of thousands of people on the streets the 
new forum opposition movement found that the thirst for riches soon 
drowned out calls to reform socialism for the good of the people 
east germans many with tears in their eyes asked over and over 
again what have we been doing for 40 years as they gazed in 
wonder at the glittering shops of west berlin after the berlin wall 
crumbled in november 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany spotting the most basic 
of all election issues furiously campaigned throughout east 
germany with a message of prosperity for all 
many recalled that that was also a favorite slogan of chancellor 
ludwig erhard the late west german leader who guided the postwar 
economic miracle 
sundays conservative win engineered in large part by kohl 
shows that east germans believe in a second economic miracle 
the east germans have voted for the west german mark and for 
unification commented west germanys ard television network 
it was important for them that kohl was the one with the keys to 
the cash box 
and that said ard set the christian democratic chancellor 
apart from west germanys opposition social democrats who often 
lectured east german voters on the need to slow down the pace of 
unification and curb their expectations 
while poles hungarians and czechoslovaks now enjoy 
onceunthinkable democracy it will take them years if not 
decades to reform their economies the governments will have to 
attract and compete for western investment at the same time they 
learn to cope with multiparty systems 
for east germans the road to recovery seems much closer 
the decisive thought for east germans may have been if we 
vote for kohl the money will flow said oskar lafontaine the 
social democrat governor of west germanys saarland state who will 
try to unseat kohl in december elections 
in fact east german leftists had joined the communists several 
times in recent weeks in virtually begging kohl for billions of 
dollars in bailout money to save the ravaged economy 
each time kohls heavily publicized answer was no not 
until the east german voters show they want true economic reform 
even so its a long way from voting in the conservatives to 
accepting the bitter pills kohls economic advisers and west german 
investors are likely to be handing out 
east germans some still covered with grease and dressed in 
overalls had been seizing the microphones at dozens of panel 
discussions to denounce any reforms that would cost their jobs 
but last weeks announcement that west germanled economic 
reforms will cost 100000 jobs in the east german automobile 
industry and related sectors is believed to be just the tip of the 
iceberg 
another potentially destabilizing factor is the continuing 
hemorrhage of east germans relocating to west germany many of them 
trying to take a shortcut to prosperity 
i dont think the results themselves will stop the 
emigration conceded east german christian democratic leader 
lothar de maiziere the top contender for the premiers post 
rather its a question of measures that now must be taken 
with the number of emigrants heading west at up to 2500 a day 
those measures will have to be fast and convincing 
kohl himself used his first postelection statements to plead 
with east germans to stay put and help build up their beautiful 
country 
there was no mention of the countrys decaying homes nor of its 
pollutionchoked rivers and air 
left behind with only a few crumbs thrown by loyal voters were 
new forum and other leftist groups that had preached the need for 
east germans to maintain their own identity and forge a new 
path between capitalism and socialism 
its not the first time that a people has forgotten its own 
martyrs commented ard television noting that many of the 
pioneers of the prodemocracy movement had spent years in jail 
working for their cause 
said stephan bickhardt of the leftist democracy now party the 
revolution has cast off its children 
democracy now new forum and another leftist group had joined 
together in a much publicized coalition that failed to get even 3 
percent of the votes 
other east germans also see the end of another failed experiment 
in socialism 
its just proof that people really are just looking for riches 
and a trip to tenerife complained government worker elke heise 
naming the canary island thats a favorite vacation spot for hordes 
of sunhungry west germans each year 
added east berlin engineer fred mauer the christian democrats 
can now do with us whatever they want 
and thats likely to include even more shots called by a west 
german chancellor eager to see his name go down in history books as 
the man who united a people torn asunder by the crimes and madness 
of adolf hitler

portauprince haiti ap in a dramatic shift of power last 
week from the army to civilians this impoverished country moved 
closer to democracy than it has been since the fall of the 29year 
duvalier family dictatorship in 1986 
but ertha pascaltrouillot the new provisional president still 
faces the possibility of a backlash from diehards in the 
illdisciplined 6000man army this caribbean nations 
traditional power broker 
there still are duvalierist death squads who oppose change 
said victor benoit coleader of a political coalition that 
spearheaded the fall of the latest military regime theyre armed 
and we know theyre very mad about the shift in power 
mrs pascaltrouillot also inherits an economy destroyed by 
decades of plundering and political turmoil in a land with few 
natural resources and not enough food for its 51 million people 
but the flight of military ruler lt gen prosper avril last 
week in the face of a popular uprising and the unconditional 
submission of the army high command to a civilian caretaker 
government could become a watershed in haitian history 
barring another coup haiti could within three to six months 
have its first democratically elected government since gaining 
independence from france in 1804 after a slave revolt 
we hope this new caretaker government will finally create an 
atmosphere for holding free elections so the people can for once 
choose the leaders they want said louis roy main author of the 
1987 constitution 
the last attempt to hold free and fair elections in november 
1987 were thwarted after thugs protected by soldiers killed at 
least 34 voters 
university professor leslie manigat was elected as a civilian 
president the following january but the vote was widely regarded 
as fraudulent the army retained effective control and ousted 
manigat in june 1988 
mrs pascaltrouillot a 46yearold supreme court judge and 
haitis first woman president is to govern along with a 19member 
state council comprised exclusively of civilians that will have 
veto power over her decisions 
in handing over power at mrs pascaltrouillots inauguration 
tuesday maj gen herard abraham told her madame president of 
the republic the armed forces of haiti are yours to command 
it appeared the armys most complete submission to the civilian 
political opposition since the generals took control when 
jeanclaude baby doc duvalier fled into exile in france ending 
the tyranny begun by his father the late francois papa doc 
the ouster of duvalier was not the end of the dictatorship it 
was prolonged by the military said the rev gilles danroc a 
french priest and author of the fall of the house of duvalier 
whats happening now is what should have happened when 
duvalier left said communist party leader rene theodore at 
that time the peoples revolution was confiscated theyve 
recovered it now for the time being 
avril former financial adviser to the duvaliers took over 18 
months ago in a coup led by rankandfile soldiers demanding 
democratic reforms and an end to statesponsored violence the coup 
ousted the tyrannical lt gen henri namphy who had led two 
governments since duvalier 
avril pledged to turn over power to a civilian government in 
democratic elections this year and won praise from the us 
government for his campaign against drugtrafficking 
but human rights violations continued and avril was beginning 
to look more and more like a dictator in january his government 
brutally cracked down on the opposition rounding up and beating 
scores of critics and expelling seven prominent political leaders 
in response haitis major political parties announced they 
would boycott any election held under avrils rule assuming he 
would rig the vote 
on march 5 a soldier shot and killed an 11yearold girl while 
she was studying on her porch in the rural town of petit goave 
although the shooting appeared accidental it unleashed five days 
of nationwide protests 
avril resigned on march 10 and fled into exile in the united 
states two days later on a us air force transport at least 25 
people were killed and scores injured mostly in clashes between 
protesters and the security forces 
the united states and france haitis two main donors helped 
bring about avrils ouster and have said financial aid will be 
restored under a democratic government us ambassador alvin adams 
said he visited avrils home on the eve of his departure to 
persuade him to leave the country because of continuing civil 
unrest 
the 12member unity assembly the civic and political coalition 
that led the protests against avril says the new governments 
first priorities will be to organize elections and to make that 
possible keep a firm grip on the army and disarm marauding gunmen

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee says the air force has failed to provide congress with 
critical data on the b2 stealth bomber making it difficult for 
lawmakers to take up the pentagons budget request 
rep les aspin dwis told air force secretary donald rice in 
a letter released sunday that his panel some time ago requested the 
results of laboratory and scalemodel tests of the radarevading 
characteristics of the b2 
regrettably the air force has to date not submitted this 
essential information to appropriately cleared committee staff 
members aspin said in the letter dated march 12 
it would be difficult if not impossible for the committee 
to consider the bush administrations fiscal 1991 budget request 
for the stealth bomber he said 
president bush has proposed spending 55 billion and procuring 
five b2s in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the administration 
hopes to buy 132 planes considered the most expensive in history 
for a total cost of 70 billion 
air force spokesman maj dick cole said friday that rice spoke 
to aspin on tuesday the day after the letter was written and

an environmental group says average fuel 
economy for automobiles has declined each of the last two years 
reversing an earlier fiveyear trend toward more efficient 
automobiles 
the environmental action foundation on sunday cited statistics 
from the environmental protection agency and national highway 
traffic safety administration 
the average fuel economy of 1990 model cars is expected to be 
282 miles per gallon compared with 283 mpg for 1989 model cars 
and 287 mpg for 1988 model cars according to the government 
figures cited by the group 
an analysis by the epa attributed the trend to the manufacture 
of heavier cars with quicker acceleration times and the use of 
larger engines with greater horsepower 
in terms of fuel efficiency were heading south on a 
northbound oneway street said robert dewey of the 
environmental action foundation 
the figures showed that between the 1983 and 1988 model years 
the fuel efficiency of both domestic and imported cars increased 
steadily from 264 mpg to 287 mpg

east germanys likely new premier lothar de 
maiziere got a taste of a free press after leading a conservative 
coalition to victory when hundreds of journalists stormed a 
television studio to get a crack at him 
east german television inexperienced in covering free 
elections continued to broadcast minor polling tables instead of 
turning its cameras on the fracas in which the slight bespectacled 
de maiziere was violently pushed and shoved 
we have no experience with this kind of stuff i was 
speechless when these people barged in here said anchorman peter 
guette 45 who was pummeled by photographers chasing de maiziere 
around the studio table 
the studio riot was just one of several sideshows sunday in the 
palace of the republic east germanys glittering parliament 
building where about 3000 journalists from as far away as china 
and brazil had set up shop to cover east germanys first free 
elections in its 41year history 
the glassfronted fivestory building once the showpiece of 
hardline communist rulers had been turned into a giant television 
studio with about 50 different networks staking out floor space 
most major candidates and scores of west german politicians 
moved from studio to studio for interviews thronged by dozens of 
photographers some perched on stepladders 
many east germans at the palace expressed disappointment over 
the circuslike atmosphere 
people could have been a little bit more disciplined said 
irene gruner staffing an information desk on the sidelines this 
is our first free election and we would have liked to have a 
little order 
the leaders of the reformed communist party boycotted the palace 
to protest what they considered the undue influence of west 
germanys two major television stations which had taken east 
german television under their wings and also run the vote 
projections 
de maiziere chairman of the christian democrats granted 
interviews to the two west german stations ard and zdf before 
speaking before east german cameras 
guette and other east german television officials sharply 
criticized de maizieres behavior saying it was an example of his 
willingness to submit to the west german financial steamroller 
we had an election and now we are being taken over said 
guette 
de maiziere an advocate of a speedy merger with west germany 
won massive campaign support from west germanys christian 
democrats which are headed by chancellor helmut kohl 
at the christian democrats victory party in a nearby 
restaurant about 2000 ecstatic supporters chanted helmut 
helmut when the first projections indicated the completely 
unexpected results 
i cant believe it said eberhard engler the partys east 
berlin chief shouted over the noise hundreds of supporters 
grabbed each other by the shoulders and snaked through the 
restaurant in a chain 
at the cavernous headquarters of the party of democratic 
socialism the renamed successor of the longruling communist 
party the mood was subdued the party won a little more than 16 
percent of the vote and will be relegated to the opposition 
its terrifying how many people are rightwing said elke 
heise a suporter and industry ministry employee we may have to 
take to the streets to fight for our rights i doubt that things 
will remain as peaceful as they are now

a new voiceactivated typewriter is a 
sciencefiction dreamturnedreality that promises to boost 
productivity and open a world of opportunity for the handicapped 
the dragondictate voicetypewriter which was being formally 
unveiled today by dragon systems inc is billed as the first of 
its kind in the world 
my only regret is that your product didnt come out 20 years 
ago frank whitney a quadriplegic maryland computer scientist 
told the company in a letter written on the system whitney has 
used the system for the past year 
the typewriter which consists of software and a 
speechrecognition circuit board for personal computers allows 
users to create memos manuscripts and other documents by speaking 
instead of typing users speak into a microphone and see text 
appear on a video screen at the rate of 35 words a minute 
the 9000 system can recognize 30000 words and adapt itself to 
individual speakers until now voiceactivated systems had not 
been able to recognize more than 5000 words 
the commands are simple to turn off the system one says 
voice console go to sleep to turn it on the command is 
voice console wake up 
a mistake is corrected by saying oops and repeating the 
correct word many functions can be operated manually as well 
the technology can address all segments of the workplace 
says janet baker who founded the company with her husband james 
in 1982 after stints in speechrecognition product development at 
ibm corp and exxon corp 
the system is designed for professionals who dont type well or 
who want to write reports and letters that otherwise would be 
dictated to a secretary then transcribed 
the only people who are really good typists are journalists 
computer programmers and secretaries said baker doctors 
lawyers and a lot of other people often just hunt and peck or they 
rely on handing notes to someone to type up 
dragondictate is also seen as a great boon to the disabled 
whitney and others with disabilities have used the system in test 
marketing around the country for the past year 
laura harris a 19yearold sophomore at harvard university was 
born without fingers on her left hand she taught herself to type 
with her right hand but did so much typing as a freshman 
government major she injured her hand she was forced to dictate 
her papers into a tape recorder and give it to another student to 
transcribe 
since january harris has used dragondictate 
it was so hard to dictate before because i couldnt actually 
see what i was writing so i couldnt edit i often ended up trying 
to write longhand and that was painful said harris 
dragondictate is just amazing it allows me to go back to typing 
and editing my work 
the system adjusts to each users voice and vocabulary because 
individual voices can vary widely 
dragondictate is compatible with an ibm personal computer with a 
386 microprocessor

these are heady days at the hoover 
institution on war revolution and peace where scholars surrounded 
by the largest collection of soviet papers outside the kremlin hope 
to close the book on communism 
they are scouring eastern europe and the soviet union sweeping 
up papers posters and other artifacts to add to the 25 miles of 
library shelves that house everything from the first editions of 
pravda to the latest speeches by soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
the late president hoover a lifelong foe of communism founded 
the library with his own world war i collection two years after the 
1917 soviet revolution 
today more than merely collecting hoover economists 
historians and political scientists are analyzing and playing a 
role in the transition of the soviet bloc by meeting with leaders 
of the new governments and us officials 
former secretary of state george p shultz an honorary fellow 
at hoover and us ambassador to czechoslovakia shirley temple 
black a former member of hoovers board of overseers are helping 
set up some of the meetings 
we are in a new era that is revolutionary shultz said in an 
interview in his office at hoover in the center of the stanford 
university campus 
it is fascinating to think about the problems of transition 
from one kind of system to another kind how you manage that some 
people here will be thinking about that and studying that and 
trying to be helpful to people doing that through this period i 
want to be part of that process of change 
other think tanks are similarly abuzz with scholars looking at 
upheavals overseas 
the center for strategic and international studies based in 
washington sees its mission now as helping america cope with a 
radically different world said robert e hunter vice president of 
the centers regional programs 
some of the academic cold warriors have even taken to gloating 
about the changes in the soviet bloc which they believe were 
pushed along by their policy recommendations 
we absolutely feel vindicated said burton yales pines 
senior vice president of the conservative heritage foundation in 
washington its a nice feeling its not often that its given 
to people to feel victory the way weve felt it the last year and a 
half 
but the general consensus among scholars that communism is dying 
out four months after the berlin wall began coming down is 
still based in some optimism said hoover acting director john 
raisian 
were hopeful there wont be any fallbacks its not quite 
over but its proceeding along those lines 
recently retired hoover director w glenn campbell warns that 
communism is far from dead yet 
no one has said communism is dead in china north korea or 
cuba and there are enormous problems in privatizing all the 
economies in the countries wrecked getting a price system getting 
a foreign exchange there are a whole host of problems and anything 
can happen 
but there is a pervasive sense among some scholars that 
communism has been exposed as a failed experiment 
i think the idea that you can run a society or an economy 
effectively by centrally placed authoritarian or dictatorial means 
has been proven bankrupt shultz said

sparkling with color luxury and youthful abandon 
christian lacroixs show of readytowear and luxe lines was a 
winner for women who want to have fun looking feminine 
the lean pants minis tunics and fitted or smocky tops of the 
readytowear line shown sunday melded right into the more 
expensive luxe 
i love it said john fairchild publisher of womens wear 
daily and w its highly decorative he gives the clothes 
personality more than any other designer and its never boring 
looking pale but happy lacroix took a bow after the intimate 
show in his shop on a sunny day he still is recovering from two 
back operations and walked stiffly 
the eyecatching clothes went from reversible shocking pink and 
orange shortie trapeze toppers over pink tights and orange suede 
overtheknee boots to little burgundyyellowblack bicycle tights 
with pullovers or vnecked minitunics in chartreuse and rust with 
ribbed tights 
lacroix also worked with a wealth of fabrics typical was an 
outfit featuring a jewelbuttoned burgundy and yellow jacket in a 
patchwork of little hearts and geometrics over a flowered tapestry 
miniskirt 
lacroixs favorite folklore themes were in both collections 
like the opulent fortuneteller or gypsy skirts with velvet star and 
baroque embroideries on jackets and full multicolored silk skirts 
he also made a hit with his bright pink suits elaborately 
embroidered and piped with lush black velvet 
when presented with boleros these suits of light were a 
dashing salute to the bull rings of spain and lacroixs native 
arles 
from the simple black crepe sheath with its split skirt topped 
by a jeweled flower to the little white satin collared navy 
georgette and chiffon numbers with flippy godet flares the clothes 
were showy fun and luxurious 
totally wearable and saleable said ellin saltzman vice 
president and creative director of rh macy 
lynn manulis of marthas boutiques another american who adored 
the show said id like to buy the whole collection its varied 
and cohesive he has a kind of genius i think finally the public 
is ready for him this seems to point the way were going 
another winner for color was italian enrico coveri he drew 
inspiration from the ski slopes showing brightly flowered long 
pullovers paired with stretch tights plus some hot numbers based 
on ski suits appliqued with starfish designs 
his plaid suits with long tweed jackets matching brimmed hats 
and shortie sarongsplit skirts were fetching for daytime and the 
gymsuit body stocking worn with lame boots and a cape of 
multicolored outsized mirror sequins would knock them dead on the 
ski scene 
meanwhile italian romeo giglis saturday night show drew kudos 
for artistry 
gigli went on his usual exotic trip of fabrics producing 
heartshaped coats in luxurious silks and velvets of brown and 
bordeaux 
the coats worn over narrow stretch pants often had shawl 
collars so huge they completely engulfed necks and shoulders the 
neckless shoulderless look all part of the heartshaped silhouette 
in shades of bordeaux rust and fuchsia gigli played around 
with the bigcollared shortie coats crackling with flameshaped 
hems over the leanest striped pants that outfit was topped by a 
goldembroidered red velvet wimple

in new orleans it seems almost every other 
recipe begins take a stick of butter what isnt cooked 
with butter is likely to be deepfried or seasoned with fat pork 
so what will 24000 heart doctors eat during the american 
college of cardiologys convention this week 
at all the official events we serve hearthealthy foods so 
60 minutes doesnt end up at our convention and show that theres 
a contradiction of terms going on said linda karson director of 
meeting services for the american college of cardiology 
that means cereal muffins yogurt and fruit for breakfast 
rather than eggs sardou or any of the other cholesterolladen local 
breakfast favorites lunches and dinner menus are heavy on fish and 
chicken with vegetables and lots of green and pasta salads 
one of the biggest challenges karson said was working up a 
menu for tuesday nights sights sounds music food and culture 
of new orleans 
doing hearthealthy food in new orleans is kind of a 
contradiction in terms she acknowledged 
tuesday nights menu includes cajun potpourri gumbo with 
chicken and fish but without cholesterolladen shellfish an 
essential ingredient of seafood gumbo or sausage which is almost 
always included with chicken 
the red beans and rice will not have any salt pork or ham hocks 
and the poboy sandwiches will have lean meat and lowcholesterol 
mayo the andouille sausage will be made with turkey and the 
jambalaya with chicken 
well give them the atmosphere of it more than the actual 
food said karson 
but even heart doctors are likely to splurge on their diets in 
new orleans in november mothers restaurant which specializes in 
poboys sausageandchicken jambalaya and porkseasoned red beans 
was full of conventioneers wearing american heart association 
nametags 
doctors could be seen in tonier restaurants at dinner chowing 
down on red meat chicken and fish with buttery sauces and new 
orleansstyle barbecued shrimp which comes to the table swimming 
in spicy butter 
i think the majority of people when they hit new orleans 
kind of say well throw it to the winds said kermit cosse 
associate general manager at antoines were known for so many 
restaurants in new orleans and were known for food 
but lally brennan one of the workers at commanders palace 
said the restaurant includes light entrees on the menu and finds 
many heart doctors take advantage of them 
whenever we have cardiologists in town they always want 
lightertype foods she said we put lots of fish on the menu 
with light sauces because we know theyll ask for it we still have 
our other goodies if they want to splurge but we expect them to 
order a lot of the lighter things 
the food vendors at the new orleans convention center will offer 
some healthy foods as well as their standard hot dogs hamburgers 
and sandwiches karson said 
they did offer a whole lot of hearthealthy food during the 
american heart association meeting she said the big joke is 
theyve got caseloads of turkey dogs left they didnt really go 
karson acknowledged that meeting organizers cant stop private 
concessionaires from selling nor doctors from eating what they 
want at the convention 
we wont say everyones real concerned about hearthealthy 
food she said but at least we can say weve made a real 
effort to provide it

sylvia jenkins is matteroffact about the 
drug conviction that landed her in federal prison but mention her 
two young grandchildren and tears trickle down her cheeks 
its very hard said jenkins who wont let the children 
visit her because she hates to watch them leave every time they 
want to come up i say not this weekend 
jenkins 52 is pulling a fiveyear stretch at the federal 
correctional institution in danbury she has a running track a 
view of gentle hills and a job as a tutor 
and now there are also innovative programs to help people like 
her deal with the emotions of being a mother or grandmother behind 
bars and the reunion when she finishes her time 
there are more than 2000 mothers in federal prisons across the 
country the system is providing such things as parenting classes 
and special visitation days 
the government wants female inmates to be better prepared when 
they leave prison to deal with their families said ann bartolo 
chief of the female offender section of the federal bureau of 
prisons 
bartolos latest project is a program allowing pregnant inmates 
to stay at halfway houses three months after giving birth so they 
can keep the babies with them mothers now can keep their babies 
only two days before giving them to relatives or foster families 
about 3150 women live in eight permanent and five temporary 
facilities in the federal prison system about 75 percent have 
children ranging in age from 6 months to 45 years fifty inmates 
are pregnant 
danbury is considered one of the better prisons its a 
minimumsecurity camp on the fringe of a mens penitentiary there 
are no bars and pictures of loved ones are allowed atop short 
metal lockers where inmates keep their clothes 
the prison started a special family day last year allowing 
children inside for a day to see where mother eats and sleeps 
its fairly relaxed theres nothing up there that gives you a 
prison atmosphere said superintendent john sullivan a father of 
seven who oversees 170 women in the camp and 1100 men in the 
penitentiary 
children also attend events like graduations where they see 
their mothers in caps and gowns accepting high school diplomas 
another of the federal systems programs has playrooms in 
womens prisons and sets up a counseling service for family 
emergencies such as drug arrests or bad grades in school bartolo 
said 
a parenting class is so popular in danbury it even draws inmates 
without children the program helps women understand their 
relationship with their own parents while teaching them to deal 
with their children 
its training the inmate in parenting skills what does it 
mean now that theyre going to be in for x amount of years and this 
child most likely will be attached to a foster parent bartolo 
said 
it helps the mother after shes released to slowly walk into 
this childs life and also to deal with her skills as a parent how 
to deal with discipline and anger the child feels that she wasnt 
with her all the time

a program aimed at keeping students in school 
by cutting welfare payments to families whose children have poor 
attendance has been ineffective according to a study by the 
university of wisconsinmilwaukee 
only 28 percent of milwaukee county teenagers affected by gov 
tommy g thompsons welfare reform measure returned to school and 
were still there after two months according to the universitys 
employment amp training institute 
payments from aid to families with dependent children were 
reduced by 34 million because of penalties assessed by the 
program the study showed more than 3700 teens in the county are 
subject to the learnfare program 
the university study was conducted by john pawasarat and lois 
quinn who examined more than 4 million records from the milwaukee 
county department of social services 
the new study proves learnfare is not effective michael soika 
associate director of the office of social concerns for the 
milwaukee catholic archdiocese said this weekend 
under the pretext of helping them we are exacerbating their 
problem by taking money away from them and i would suspect 
creating more turmoil and tension in their lives he said

guidelines to protect the wetlands 
along the lower mississippi river are slowing development and could 
reverse the economic revival sought by congress for this 
povertystricken region some officials say 
farmers plans to dig ditches build dikes or ponds and clear 
land have been put on hold and as the construction season 
approaches developers fear delays paperwork and the mitigation 
of land will increase building costs 
were just about going to miss the work season said dennis 
sorrell of bond engineering in west memphis sorrel said he has 
residential subdivisions a county health building apartment 
complexes and other industrial projects on hold 
when developers dont develop engineers dont work lumber 
companies dont sell lumber carpenters dont work he said 
under new federal guidelines developers and farmers must obtain 
a permit issued by the us army corps of engineers before turning 
a spade of dirt in the wetlands yet no section 404 permits have 
been issued in arkansas and a corps spokesman said none would be 
issued for some time 
the new no net loss policy spurred by bush administration 
efforts to comply with environmental laws states wetlands that 
have been taken over must be replaced also the amount of lands 
defined as wetlands has increased 
roughly threefourths of the region now meets the new 
definition instead of about 20 percent previously classified as 
wetlands according to the lower mississippi delta development 
commission 
ron murphy a natural resources specialist with the 
memphisbased commission said the new definition does not 
distinguish between different land 
weve got to identify that high quality wetland and then 
there needs to be some balance struck he said 
were looking into it as a major problem the wetlands policy 
is going to have a significant impact on economic development in 
the delta he said 
the development commission has scheduled meetings this week with 
members of congress from arkansas and other states on possible 
legislative remedies to the new wetlands policy 
wetlands regulations changed to become more uniform said furcy 
zeringue a corps of engineers project manager 
there is a lack of certainty as to the amount and type of 
mitigation that will be acceptable or will be needed for certain 
types of projects he said 
people who change the use of wetlands could be forced to replace 
that acreage with new wetlands and costs eventually would be 
passed on to consumers developers said 
another problem is the time needed to get a permit which can 
take up to 90 days 
bruce blackall executive director of the arkansas home builders 
association said that while wetlands must be protected it may 
be the pendulum swung too far

germans from both sides of the 
border turned this decaying industrial town into a symbol of unity 
celebrating the east german elections as the prelude to a merger 
crowds filled the dusty cobblestone streets and squares a huge 
traffic jam paralyzed the city as thousands of west germans crossed 
the border to join the celebration 
many believed east germanys first free elections were also the 
formerly communist countrys last as a separate state and 
reunification with the west was the inevitable next step 
the pressure right now for unification is immense said rolf 
bode 29 a building manager in this city of 50000 about 10 miles 
from the border 
eisenach is home to the countrys secondlargest automaker the 
veb automobile werk eisenach which employs about 10000 people 
of course we want a united germany said peter voigt 40 a 
technician we speak the same language we have a long shared 
tradition and we belong together 
cornelia bode 30 a nurse who says she has often thought about 
emigrating to the west said the people want the unification 
above everything occupation powers here as well as over there 
have to go now 
erhardt jung a 35yearold metal worker said he voted for the 
christian democrats because the party has drawn the clearest and 
quickest line for unification 
im looking forward to a true free market here he said 
the central economy was a farce it has to go forwards from here 
unification as quickly as possible 
wilhelm guenther a 62yearold accountant said plans for a 
rapid unification and immediate investment from the big german 
brother to the west were the only ways to prevent more east 
germans from leaving the country 
an estimated 2500 east germans have left the country each day 
since the start of the year 
the overwhelming majority are for a speedy unification he 
said if theres a unification there will be no reason to leave 
it has to happen fast

the tokyo markets anxiety about a possible 
interest rate hike and the yens decline against the dollar sent 
the key index on the tokyo stock exchange plummeting to a 14month 
low today 
the dollar meanwhile rose sharply against the yen to a mark a 
threeyear high fueled by the currencys bullishness in overseas 
markets and tokyos poor performance 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which fell 
5520 points on friday plunged 135320 points or 415 percent 
today its closing of 3126324 was the lowest since it closed at 
3117038 on jan 20 1989 
the nikkeis decline today was the third biggest singleday 
decline for the index it plunged 383648 or 149 percent on 
oct 20 1987 in the worldwide black monday stock market 
crash and 156910 points or 450 percent on feb 26 
in todays early trading the index rose 105 points as investors 
were encouraged by fridays gains on wall street but early 
optimism was followed by a sharp late morning decline as 
institutional investors began cashing in their trust funds 
the anxiety about the interest rate hike coupled with the 
weak yen against the dollar are the main causes of todays fall 
said ichitaro watanabe a dealer with nikko securities co the 
market as a whole appears very pessimistic about the current 
situation and i have heard that there was some panic selling 
he added that a sharp fall in index future prices also triggered 
massive selling on the spot market 
there was not one outstanding reason for the nikkeis fall 
today said keiichi nishida of kidder peabody securities but 
rather while the market as a whole lacks buying incentives 
entirely a series of bad news such as the interest rate hike and 
unstable exchange rates hit the market triggering the sharp fall 
nishida warned that because mondays drop was not the result 
of panic selling there is a widely shared fear in the market that 
share prices may fall even further until they really hit the 
bottom 
but at this point no one knows where the bottom really is 
he added 
a share of nippon telegraph and telephone corp which once was 
the driving force of the affluent tokyo exchange declined 20000 
yen from the previous days close to finish at 18 million yen the 
lowest since it was released in the market in april 1986 
in the currency market the dollar closed at 15355 yen up 105 
yen from fridays close of 15250 yen after opening at 15248 yen 
it seesawed in a wide range of 1523515380 yen 
currency dealers said the dollar was firm against the japanese 
yen even though the american currency was sold against the west 
german mark because of the conservatives impressive showing sunday 
in east germanys elections 
the nikkeis sharp drop in the stock market prompted the market 
players selling of the yen for the dollar giving a stronger 
upward push to the american currency they said 
the market players were expecting to see a stronger yen today 
as the speculation about a possible interest rate hike on tuesday 
swirled around the market said a dealer with daiichi kangyo 
bank who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but after seeing the unexpectedly bullish dollar monday 
morning players began buying the dollar almost onesidedly he 
added i would not be surprised to see the dollar surpass the 
154yen mark before the interest rate hike actually happens 
dealers said the bank of japan made largescale 
interventions throughout today to stem the yens fall one dealer 
with daiichi kangyo bank said the central bank bought at least 1 
billion worth of the japanese yen today 
but masaaki tanahashi a dealer with the mitsui bank said some 
market players were hesitating to buy the yen until the bank of 
japan decides to raise its official discount rate from the current 
425 percent 
japanese media have speculated for weeks that the bank of japan 
will raise its key lending rate charged for loans to commercial 
banks by as much as one percentage point 
this would affect other domestic interest rates

the french socialist party congress ended 
in failure sunday with the struggle for the leadership unresolved 
and the party unable to agree on a basic political program 
the power struggle between major personalities that has rent the 
party in recent months went down to the wire and allnight attempts 
to work out a compromise in committee ultimately failed 
there was virtually no debate during the fourday congress on 
the major issues facing the country such as unemployment or the 
future of europe 
throughout the congress the partys top figures declared they 
wanted to compromise and merge their various agendas into a single 
political program for the next three years but none budged from 
the position he came with 
the next national legislative elections are not scheduled until 
1993 and the presidential election is set for 1995 but jockeying 
for power and support already is in full swing 
there were seven motions or platforms put forth for party 
members to choose from precongress voting among the 7200 party 
militants from the various local federations put the motions of 
party first secretary pierre mauroy allied with former first 
secretary lionel jospin in a dead heat with former premier laurent 
fabius protege of president francois mitterrand and possessor of 
clear ambitions for the elysee palace 
the official count contested by fabius and his followers 
gave the mauroy forces 289 percent of the vote a hair ahead of 
fabius with 288 percent in third place was premier michel rocard 
with 243 percent but rocard a presidential hopeful who controls 
only a minority in the party refused to choose sides 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement who won 85 percent of 
the vote and has made no secret of his interest in the presidency 
threw his support behind the mauroyjospin motion and jean 
poperen minister for relations with parliament in the rocard 
government who won 72 percent backed fabius 
two other motions won a total of 2 percent of the vote 
leaders of the various factions scheduled a meeting for tuesday 
in paris to try to write a program that will rally the party around 
a single platform and work out a deal on who gets the top 
leadership positions if that fails the matter will be decided by 
the partys board of directors scheduled to meet on wednesday 
the makeup of the board of directors named last week is 
proportional to the votes received by the various motions thus the 
scramble will be on to forge alliances with smaller factions 
this was the first congress in the history of the party that was 
unable to find a clear majority faction to rally and lead a unified 
party the fight essentially involved two figures who both claim to 
be the inheritors of the mantle of mitterrand jospin the man who 
followed mitterrand as the head of the party and fabius once 
frances youngest premier who has made a career on mitterrands 
coattails

walter s mack who rescued a largely unknown 
pepsicola co during the depression and turned it into the 
countrys no 2 soft drink maker has died after a lengthy illness 
he was 94 
mack died in his sleep early sunday at his manhattan home where 
he had been recuperating from a december bout with pneumonia and 
heart disease said his son walter s mack jr 
during the 1930s mack tackled the job of reviving troubled but 
promising companies 
it was while trying to save the new yorkbased lofts candy 
chain that he took a special interest in its pepsi syrup division 
pepsi was spun off and mack became its president in 1938 
lofts had sold the syrup formulated by a north carolina 
druggist in 1893 only to candy stores 
it made little headway in the market until mack broke 
cocacolas control of the name cola in a historic fight with 
coke chief robert woodruff 
mack also bought what he called the first commercial jingle 
ever heard on the air the jingle played in the first 30 and 
60second network spots 
pepsicola hits the spot 
twelve full ounces thats a lot 
twice as much for a nickel too 
pepsicola is the drink for you 
by the early 1940s pepsi was an international giant second only 
to cocacola in sales 
after stepping down as pepsi president in 1951 he ran the 
nedicks hot dog chain and headed several other companies 
mack graduated from harvard in 1917 and volunteered for war 
service he later won a commission to the us naval academy at 
annapolis md 
he started the young republican club in the democratic bastion 
of new york city he ran unsuccessfully for the state senate in 
1932 and worked on mayor fiorello laguardias mayoral campaigns he 
also served as chairman of the new york county republican committee 
he was an extraordinarily energetic and creative man said 
republican state sen roy m goodman 
in 1978 at 82 mack brought together a group of former cola 
company executives to launch kingcola corp it filed for 
bankruptcy three years later 
work keeps me alive as it does a great many people he 
testified before the house select committee on aging in 1981 
mack remained active until about two years ago his son said 
as he aged he came more to believe that you do your best and 
keep trying and if things dont work out you keep going walter 
jr said thats probably what kept him young 
his wife ruth died in 1986 he is survived by two sons walter 
jr an assistant us attorney in manhattan and anthony of los 
angeles and two daughters alice m sawyer of wilmington del 
and florence ann kelly of manhattan 
a memorial service was planned for thursday at the bethel 
chapel at temple emanuel where mack was treasurer for 56 years

hardline communists 
de maiziere has acknowledged his party was financed by the 
communists in exchange for giving parliamentary support he has 
also admitted that some christian democratic leaders like ousted 
communists stole party funds 
the party leader has also said his partys past will hinder a 
fresh start in a democratic east germany many east germans now 
openly despise people who supported the ousted hardline communist 
regime 
de maiziere who is married and has three daughters rose to 
prominence after the popular revolution last fall as deputy premier 
in the caretaker government of reformist communist premier hans 
modrow 
in the election however his party embraced support from west 
german chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats 
de maiziere has strong personal ties to west germany 
his uncle ulrich de maiziere held a top post in the west 
german army his cousin thomas de maiziere is the west berlin

ronald and nancy reagan are the latest in a 
string of notables to come to the hospital bedside of david opont 
the 12yearold boy fighting back from a nightmarish attack by a 
bully who set him afire 
the reagans visited the severely burned boy sunday evening at 
new york hospitalcornell medical center just hours after the 
youth had had a visit from actor bill cosby 
the outpouring of sympathy and good wishes from around the 
country most of it from people hes never met began after the 
march 7 attack by a 13yearold boy from davids neighborhood 
more than 400 cards and letters arrived in a single day along 
with an assortment of stuffed animals posters and baseball caps 
he also received numerous gifts flowers and balloons on his 12th 
birthday the day after the brutal attack 
you not only can have a great feeling for him and his 
recovery but down deep there is a resentment that these things can 
happen the former president said after spending a few minutes 
with opont 
if his recovery goes perfectly david could be out of the 
hospital in june if there are any complications he could die his 
chances of making a full recovery remain only 5050 doctors said 
a fund set up to cover davids massive medical expenses received 
between 15000 and 20000 donations in five days said opont family 
lawyer michael prieto who is overseeing the contributions about 
two dozen local clergy are holding a weeklong prayer vigil at the 
hospital where david will probably spend the next 12 weeks 
in addition skin banks run by the vietnam veterans of america 
and the new york firefighters skin bank have offered to assist the 
youth 
the horror of the crime the heinous nature of this crime and 
the ages of the people involved have helped produce this 
response said prieto 
diana goldin a hospital spokeswoman said the heavily bandaged 
boy was delighted with the visit from cosby 
david recognized him and was very pleased he cosby joked 
around with him she said 
the reagans who flew in from california sunday for an award 
ceremony monday night asked to visit opont after reading about his 
plight 
naomi opont davids sister said david brightened up and gave a 
small smile when he saw the reagans but did not speak he cant 
smile a lot because it hurts she said 
others who have donned hospital garb to offer their support 
include mayor david dinkins and the rev jesse jackson 
his optimism and spirit have won over the hospital staff 
hes a fighter if you ask him does it hurt he says no 
even during procedures we know are uncomfortable said dr cleon 
goodwin head of the hospital burn unit hes tough 
davids attacker a 13yearold whose name is being withheld 
because of his age allegedly admitted torching the youth after 
tying him to a railing inside an abandoned garage in chilling 
testimony detective george klingberg quoted the suspects account 
of the incident 
i walked over to him i lit a match i held it up to his 
shirt his shirt caught on fire and i got scared and ran off 
opont originally told relatives he was torched because he 
refused to smoke crack but no drug charges were filed against the 
suspect 
david wound up with second and thirddegree burns over 55 
percent of his body 
the attack nearly ended the dream david brought with him when he 
arrived in new york 18 months ago from portauprince haiti he 
came over with his sister naomi and was reunited with their 
father luther who had immigrated in 1981 
while david initially spoke his native creole and very little 
english he became a good student and applied himself in school a 
school photo of david shows the boy in a jacket and tie looking 
seriously into the camera 
his sister said the 12yearolds goal was to become a doctor 
and support their mother premese who works as a seamstress on 
the morning he was beaten bound and burned david was walking with 
friends to the walt whitman intermediate school 
all the teachers like him at school because hes fun his 
sister said he always has a story to tell them but hes 
wellbehaved 
davids passions were like those of any other 12yearold he 
enjoys rap music nintendo games and the cosby show his first 
saturday in the hospital the boy asked to watch cartoons 
but the scars will remain with him for life both physically and 
emotionally doctors said the boy will need many years of 
psychological aftercare said goodwin 
the effect on davids family is harder to assess 
in the days after the burning his parents and other family 
members were stunned by the viciousness of the attack and shaken by 
the severity of davids condition 
i cannot believe a guy would do that said an anguished 
odridge opont a cousin of the burned youth this family cannot 
believe what happened to david 
seated nearby in the hospital lobby the boys father sobbed and 
shook his head in his hands hes not ok yet luther opont 
said softly before walking away

a rogue computer program that steals electronic 
documents and covers its own tracks has invaded dozens of computers 
in a nationwide computer network a published report said 
the program has infiltrated the computers of corporations 
nonclassified military installations government laboratories and 
several universities the new york times reported in todays 
editions 
los alamos national laboratory digital equipment corporation 
harvard university boston university and the university of texas 
are among the affected institutions unidentified investigators 
told the times 
the computer network is internet a worldwide collection of 
computer systems that links corporations government projects and 
universities together 
government computer security teams have been unable to trace the 
source of the illegal program 
their job has been especially difficult because the program 
automatically erases computer files that would help them trace 
breakins the newspaper said 
no classified military computers have been affected and damage 
has been slight to the internet system unidentified government 
officials told the newspaper 
the computer attack is being run through a single hidden 
location but in order to avoid detection the hacker is connecting 
to internet through a series of computers 
the program is designed to find a file containing the systems 
passwords and copy the file into another computer for decoding 
some of the breakins were traced to texas and new mexico before 
investigators lost the trail 
internet was thrown into chaos in november 1988 when a program 
written by robert tappan morris a graduate student at cornell 
university jammed the system 
the new program is not the same as one that morris used that 
program called a worm copied itself from computer to computer as 
a computer virus does 
the computer virus frenzy is not the real problem said 
peter neumann a computer security expert at sri international a 
research center in menlo park calif the real problem is the 
fact that the computers are so vulnerable and whether the attack 
is by one person at a computer or a program like a worm or virus 
theyre all exploiting the same problem the vulnerability of our 
computer systems

dollar slightly bid 
sundays landslide victory for east germanys conservative 
parties is expected to lead to solid gains by the deutsche mark

union comes said one dealer at a european bank in frankfurt 
we just dont know what will happen 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins

16873 west german marks down from 16945

three shinto shrines in tokyo were burned to the 
ground before dawn today and police said they suspected 
ultraleftist extremists 
no one was hurt in the three separate fires at the shrines of 
japans native religion said an official of the tokyo metropolitan 
police department 
the official who requested anonymity said investigators 
believed it was arson because batteries and electric cords such as 
those used in detonators were found near two of the shrines 
he identified the three wooden shrines as the hikawa shrine 
shinmei shrine and shirahige shrine each several miles apart the 
fires occurred at around 3 am 
on feb 3 1989 togo shrine in central tokyo was damaged by a 
predawn explosion that shattered more than a dozen windows and 
burned a covered passageway 
the ultraleftist kakurokyo or revolutionary workers 
association claimed responsibility for that attack and a leader 
of the group was later arrested radical groups in japan strongly 
oppose the monarchy and its traditionally close relationship with 
shinto 
the official said radical involvement in mondays fires was 
being investigated but refused further comment 
also monday 5500 riot police were mobilized to remove a tower 
built illegally on the site of planned expansion of tokyos new 
international airport 
a 150ton steel cage was lowered over the 50foot tower as six 
antiairport radicals atop hurled firebombs the official said 
riot police countered with water cannon 
there were no reports of injuries on either side the official 
said 
since last december riot police have removed two similar 
structures where a new runway for the new tokyo international 
airport at narita 40 miles northwest of tokyo is under 
construction 
eight more huts remain according to airport authorities 
antigovernment radical groups backing local farmers have 
opposed the governments plans to expropriate farmland for the 
additional runway

latvias peoples front emerged victorious today 
after the baltic republics first free elections in 50 years but 
initial results showed it failed to achieve the majority needed to 
press for independence 
meanwhile reformers claimed victories in crucial runoff 
elections sunday in russia byelorussia and the ukraine the slavic 
heartland that accounts for 80 percent of the soviet unions 
territory and twothirds of its population 
in moscows proletarsky district former political prisoner 
victor bulgakov defeated yuri gorbachev a local kgb official and 
became a member of the city council 
and in leningrad prodemocracy activists claimed many victories 
in individual races and estimated they would control at least 65 
percent of the city council said elena zelinskaya of the northwest 
information agency 
communist party officials scored some victories she said 
mostly in the closed electoral districts such as army bases 
where campaigning is not allowed 
activists had hoped sundays elections to parliaments in the 
baltic republics of latvia and estonia annexed by the soviet union 
in 1940 would follow the lead of nearby lithuania and bring 
independence supporters to power estonia has not yet reported any 
election results 
lithuanias parliament was taken by independence activists in 
february and early march elections and legislators declared the 
republic independent on march 13 
the soviet congress declared the move illegal and president 
mikhail s gorbachev on friday gave the republic three days to 
respond he later offered to meet with lithuanian lawmakers and a 
delegation arrived in moscow for talks today just as the deadline 
was expiring 
latvia followed lithuania in legalizing political parties 
several months ago no such move was made in estonia but several 
parties put forward candidates without interference the soviet 
parliament legalized multiple political parties for the entire 
country last tuesday 
in latvia peoples front supporters won 108 mandates to the 
201seat parliament a large majority among the 170 legislators 
elected according to initial results cited by the soviet news 
agency tass but independence activists needed a twothirds 
majority to change latvias constitution 
among the newly elected lawmakers were 97 commmunist party 
members 34 of whom were supporters of the peoples front party 
officials lost badly in the countryside but were victorious in 
latvias capital of riga tass reported 
voter turnout in latvia was 70 percent tass said 
thousands of popular front supporters rallied in the latvian 
capital of riga sunday urging voters to support their movement at 
least five other parties including the green or environmental 
party competed in the latvian elections tass said 
in estonia local journalist michael taro predicted the peoples 
front would win about 35 of the 105 seats in the republics 
parliament with 15 or 20 more going to other proindependence 
groups 
throughout the slavic republics from moscow to vorkuta in 
northern russia reformers ran against communist party and 
government officials voters chose among candidates in some 1610 
runoffs held after no candidate gained 50 percent of the vote in 
the main round on march 4 
in moscow city council races the prodemocracy bloc claimed 10 
of 14 contested seats said irina boganseva of the voters club

former president jimmy carter today accused 
israel of violating the human rights of palestinians in the 
occupied territories and said such harsh treatment helps fuel the 
palestinian uprising 
carter on a threeday visit to israel as part of a middle east 
tour cited as abuses israeli detention of palestinian activists 
without trial house demolitions as punishment and what he termed 
excessive use of firearms against arab demonstrators 
what we are talking about is an authoritative government that 
is in charge that is depriving the people under its control of 
their basic human rights carter told reporters 
he added i think the intefadeh is being perpetuated partially 
by the abuse of the palestinians 
intefadeh is the arabic word used by palestinians for their 
27month revolt against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
israel captured the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan and 
the gaza strip from egypt in the 1967 middle east war israel 
annexed east jerusalem as part of its capital and rules the 
territories through a military government 
israelie soldiers or civilians have killed 665 palestinians 
since the uprising began in december 1987 an additional 198 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating with israeli authorities fortythree israelis have 
died in the violence 
israel has said force is necessary to put down palestinian 
violence and that actions such as detentions and house demolitions 
deter antiisraeli activities 
carter made his comments to reporters after a halfhour meeting 
with the board of the israeli information center for human rights 
in the occupied territories the group founded by liberal israeli 
politicians and academics monitors activities in the territories 
he also met with 13 palestinian leaders from the occupied 
territories and representatives of al haqlaw in the service of 
man a palestinian human rights group 
carter cited figures from the israeli center indicating that 
almost one in four 25 percent of all the adult males among the 
palestinians have been arrested at one time or another since the 
uprising began 
he was also critical of israels administrative detention 
procedures which allow the jailing of palestinians without charges 
or trial for up to a year 
in addition there have been about 650 palestinians killed by 
excessive use of firearms by the military that are not under 
lifethreatening situations carter said a lot of these are 
little children who have been killed these things are very 
disturbing to me and to the rest of the world 
faisal husseini one of the palestinian leaders who met with 
carter said the former president was very concerned about human 
rights and has a deep understanding of this problem 
carter earlier visited egypt jordan and syria he is to stop in 
tunis for talks with plo leader yasser arafat before returning to 
the united states 
carter said sunday he believes syrian leader hafez assad is 
ready to negotiate peace with israel 
carter told the associated press that after talks with the 
syrian president thursday he felt that assad is ready to make 
peace under the framework of an international conference 
syria as well as nearly all arab countries in the middle east 
has refused to officially recognize israel and has remained in a 
technical state of war with the jewish state since its 
establishment in 1948

in an unprecedented wave of murders 59 soviet 
military officers ranging in rank from lieutenant to general were 
slain last year a military affairs newsletter said today 
the newsletter published by the respected janes information 
group said the murders appear to be part of the current move of 
antipathy felt toward the armed forces particularly among younger 
age groups in ethnic regions 
in 1988 two officers were murdered and in 1987 just one it 
said 
very few of the murders have been solved and soviet 
authorities are disturbed that local law enforcement agencies are 
either incapable of or not interested in carrying out any proper 
line of inquiry the newsletter said 
it cited the case of lt igor kholostyakov stabbed 14 times 
while returning to his unit one night 
in the case of lt kholostyakov the police official arrived 
to survey the scene while his dog promptly fell asleep that was 
nine months ago since then nothing further has been done to bring 
the murderers to justice the report said 
it said a special section has been set up in the top military 
prosecutors office to work with local police and law offices new 
security guidelines are being drawn up to protect military 
personnel 
the murders come against a backdrop of rapidly rising crime in 
the soviet union and ethnic unrest in various republics military 
troops at times have been sent in to quell unrest this year they 
became the target of azerbaijani nationalists anger when they were 
deployed to stop ethnic violence in the azerbaijani capital 
the deaths listed in the newsletter did not include officers 
killed in battle 
in most cases the place where the crime occurred was not stated 
in soviet accounts said richard woff who wrote the report he 
said this made it difficult to establish any geographic pattern to 
the killings

deputy prime minister devi lal has 
withdrawn his resignation averting a crisis that had threatened to 
shatter the tenuous unity of indias 3monthold government 
prime minister vp singh refused to accept his deputys 
resignation and devi lal withdrew it on sunday senior janata dal 
party leader chimanbhai patel said 
patel said singh sent a letter to devi lal saying the people 
will never excuse us if we fail them 
taking all this into account devi lal decided to withdraw the 
resignation patel told reporters 
devi lal a top janata dal leader submitted his resignation 
from the cabinet on friday after ferocious political and press 
criticism of his son whose bid for a state legislative seat last 
month was marked by widespread violence and at least 13 deaths 
there were no conditions attached to the withdrawal and this 
is a result of positive approach by senior party leaders patel 
said 
devi lal 75 was the chief minister or top elected official 
of haryana state before resigning to join the federal cabinet his 
son om prakash chautala was appointed to succeed him as chief 
minister of the predominantly agricultural state adjacent to new 
delhi 
under indian law chautala had to win an election to the haryana 
state assembly within six months to keep the chief ministers job 
chautala ran on a janata dal ticket in a feb 27 byelection that 
subsequently was countermanded because of the violence and 
widespread allegations of voterigging by chautalas supporters in 
the meham constituency 
amid newspaper condemnations of chautalas election tactics 
federal industries minister ajit singh visited the meham district 
and demanded chautala resign as chief minister on moral grounds 
ajit singh who is unrelated to the prime minister is a strong 
rival of devi lal within the janata dal party 
the janata dal has been marked by almost continuous internal 
bickering since its founding in 1988 and the latest flap prompted 
a weekend flurry of consultations within the party 
a semblance of unity is crucial for the janata dal since it 
attained national leadership with a minority government 
former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party took the 
most votes of any single party in the november national elections 
but the 192 parliamentary seats it captured fell far short of the 
263 needed to form a majority 
the national front coalition in which the janata dal is the 
major component won only 144 seats but unlike the congress party 
it was able to muster the tacit support of rightwing and leftwing 
parties and form a government in december an outright split within 
the janata dal could topple vp singh from the prime ministers 
job

about 3000 university students 
demonstrated in heavy rain today to demand that the elderly 
politicians who dominate taiwans electoral college step down and 
be replaced by direct presidential elections 
the protest came two days before the electoral college meets to 
select the next president the only candidate is president lee 
tenghui of the ruling nationalist party 
the students boycotted classes from about a dozen universities 
to participate in the first major student demonstration since 
taiwan lifted martial law in 1987 after 38 years 
wearing yellow headbands they linked arms and sang united we 
have strength as students we have strength they met in the 
chiang kaishek memorial park named after the strongman 
nationalist leader who moved his government to taiwan after losing 
a civil war to communist forces on the chinese mainland in 1949 
there was little police presence at the park 
several hundred students vowed to continue their prodemocracy 
demonstration until after the presidential election and a dozen 
classmates began a threeday hunger strike to demand reforms 
a student circular demanded the dissolution of the 752seat 
electoral college known as the national assembly which is 
dominated by elderly nationalist politicians elected in mainland 
china before 1949 
the deputies many in their 80s and 90s were frozen in office 
to support the ruling nationalist partys claim to still be the 
sole legitimate ruler of all of china 
the students rejected a call by lee to end their occupation of 
the park which started friday when 200 students began a sitin 
education minister mao kaowen arrived at the park before dawn 
with a letter from lee asking the students staging the sitin to 
return home 
i know well what you are concerned about lee said in the 
letter i assure you that the government will give you specific 
answers soon 
the students said they were disappointed at the vague promise 
and want lee to present a specific timetable for democratic change 
almost all of taiwans 20 million people are ethnic chinese and 
last springs beijing student movement received wide sympathy here 
if people in the soviet union eastern europe and beijing dare 
to demand reforms so do we said a poster at the site of the 
park sitin

the supreme court today refused to hear 
appeals stemming from a 200 million settlement of pricefixing 
charges against the nations leading manufacturers of folding 
cartons 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that 
redistributed a 6 million surplus from the settlement in one of 
the biggest antitrust cases ever 
the manufacturers were accused of criminal antitrust violations 
in 1975 by the justice department 
in the wake of that successful prosecution the manufacturers 
were sued by 2700 customers that suit was settled in 1979 when a 
200 million fund was created to pay off all claims 
in an unusual twist some 6 million was left over in unclaimed 
money triggering a decadelong battle that led to the appeals 
acted on today 
two federal judges in illinois hubert l will and the late 
edwin a robson ordered creation of a foundation to spend the 
surplus for research on complex antitrust and classaction lawsuits 
but the 7th us circuit court of appeals in 1984 overruled the 
judges order calling it a miscarriage of justice and an abuse 
of discretion 
the appeals court instead ordered the money turned over to the 
federal government 
but before the order was carried out the manufacturers and 
their customers worked out a new agreement that would let law 
schools apply for some of the funds judges will and robson 
approved that agreement 
loyola university in chicago was awarded 12 million and the 
university of chicago 156000 
the 7th circuit court acting on an appeal by the federal 
government ruled in 1989 that the universities must return the 
money 
the appeals court then sent the case to another federal judge to 
come up with a new solution for distributing the excess money 
the appeals court suggested the money be distributed on a 
nationwide basis perhaps by giving it to the federal judicial 
center foundation that helps educate and train court personnel and 
does research to improve the federal courts 
the appeals court ruling was challenged in separate appeals by 
will and the customers who sued the folding carton manufacturers 
in a third appeal a committee will and robson appointed to 
distribute the surplus funds asked the high court to award it 
lawyer fees denied by the 7th circuit court 
bush administration lawyers in yet another appeal said the 
high court should not disturb the appeals court ruling if the 
justices agreed to review the case the government appeal said 
they should consider giving the surplus money to the federal 
government 
the cases are in re will 89927 in re folding carton 
litigation 89992 folding carton administration committee vs 
folding carton reserve fund 891081 and us vs folding carton

gov joseph f ada today signed into law a 
bill containing the most restrictive abortion legislation in the 
united states and opponents pledged to fight to measure all the 
way to the us supreme court 
the question for me really boils down to one simple point 
ada said in my heart i believe a fetus is a human being 
the law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers 
the life of the mother the law makes it a thirddegree felony to 
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure a misdemeanor for a 
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person 
to solicit a woman to have an abortion 
although the bill is now law it contains a clause calling for a 
referendum on abortion during the nov 6 general election allowing 
voters to decide whether they want to retain the law 
ada signed the bill before a room packed with dozens of abortion 
rights supporters and opponents 
my personal views on the subject of abortion have been stated 
many times and should be by now fairly well known ada said 
i do not agree with the practice of abortion except in the case 
of rape incest and where the life of the mother may be 
threatened 
it was outrageous that the bill was signed said janet 
benshoof director of the american civil liberties unions 
reproductive freedom project based in new york 
benshoof arrived sunday in this us territory in the western 
pacific ocean hoping to meet with ada to discuss the implications 
of the bill the meeting never took place 
i was devastated he was making a personal opinion benshoof 
said we all have a conscience i believe he should be making the 
decision for the people of guam 
benshoof said she will remain on guam for as long as it 
takes and said she has no immediate plans to return to new york 
the unicameral guam legislature unanimously approved the bill 
march 8 despite an opinion from attorney general elizabeth 
barrettanderson that it is unconstitutional 
it was amended before approval to provide the public referendum 
on the abortion issue 
the vote came after archbishop anthony apuron threatened to 
excommunicate any roman catholic senator who voted against the 
measure all but one of the 21 senators are catholic as is ada 
however not all senators were aware of apurons threat before the 
vote 
rachael pine staff attorney for the aclus reproductive freedom 
project had said the guam law if approved would give the us 
supreme court the opportunity to decide the core issue of the right 
to abortion 
in a letter sent to ada before the signing benshoof said the 
case would be ultimately appealed to the supreme court

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
puerto rico officials fined more than 30 million for failing to 
move quickly enough to relieve prison overcrowding 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the 
commonwealths belated efforts to ease the problem is not reason 
enough to cancel the fines 
officials from 31 states joined in urging the justices to hear 
the commonwealths appeal 
the states are alabama arizona arkansas california delaware 
florida hawaii idaho illinois indiana kansas kentucky 
louisiana maryland michigan mississippi missouri nevada new 
mexico north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island south 
dakota tennessee texas vermont utah virginia west virginia 
and wyoming 
state officials said strict enforcement of such federal court 
penalties could delay voluntary prison reforms 
the puerto rico case stems from a 1979 lawsuit by inmates a 
federal judge ruled the following year that each prisoner must be 
provided at least 35 square feet of cell space temporarily and 
ultimately 55 square feet in dormitories and 70 square feet in 
individual cells 
commonwealth officials in 1986 agreed to comply with the court 
order and began to expand prison capacity 
but in july 1987 the officials were fined 50000 plus 10 per 
day per inmate for failing to provide 35 square feet of space per 
prisoner the fines were increased in august 1988 so that by 
november 1989 they approached a total of 30 million 
gov rafael hernandez colon and other officials said tropical 
rains and an unexpected increase in the prison population prevented 
them from meeting their own deadlines for easing overcrowding 
they said they inherited the problem from a previous 
administration and had more than tripled the commonwealths prison 
budget prison capacity was increased from 5400 in 1985 to 10295 
last year they said 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld the fines last 
september 
the relevant harm confinement in an area smaller than five by 
seven feet is significant the appeals court said the number 
of prisoners suffering that harm seven to 10 percent is large 
and the time since entry of the remedial decree is long 
the appeals court said officials have not shown that meeting 
their own deadline for providing the minimum space was 
overwhelmingly difficult or anywhere near impossible 
the appeals court added that us district court judge juan m 
perezgiminez who has presided over the case could decide to use 
the fines to pay for prison expansion 
puerto rico officials said if other appeals courts adopted the 
1st circuit courts approach it could mean that states and the 
federal government would have to pay billions of dollars a year in 
fines for failing to expand prisons quickly enough 
the states that supported puerto ricos appeal said nearly every 
state in the nation is under a court order to improve prison 
conditions 
the case is hernandez colon vs feliciano 891016

beijing universitys freshmen class ordered to 
undergo a year of military training after last years prodemocracy 
uprising wrote glowingly of the experience in a letter published 
today 
your visit and that of other leading officers helped us to 
better understand that our military training certainly is not the 
punishment that others have said the students wrote to the 
education minister 
rather it indeed shows the preferential treatment the 
solicitude and loving care given to our generation of college 
students they said 
the letter was published on the front page of the communist 
party newspaper the peoples daily less than three weeks before 
the anniversary of the start of the studentled prodemocracy 
movement 
its publication also coincided with the convening this week of 
the annual session of chinas parliament the national peoples 
congress 
the lengthy letter to education minister li tieying was written 
jan 14 last year as part of the crackdown on dissent following 
the spring protests the government cut the incoming freshmen class 
at all major universities 
at beijing university the freshmen class was ordered to undergo 
a year of military training before starting their course work the 
universitys students were among the leaders of the 1989 movement 
the approximately 700 students were sent to train at an army 
base in shijiazhuang about 185 miles south of beijing reporters 
were not allowed to visit the site 
sources on beijing university campuses said they did not expect 
any activities to mark last years uprising which was crushed by 
the military in june 
everyone wants there to be trouble but no one wants to be the 
one to start it said one beijing university student 
but the schools freshman class adopted a very different tone in 
its letter 
finally we understand that although last april and may our 
nation experienced very serious turmoil and although the 
international situation is changing unpredictably the great flag 
of socialism will never fall they wrote 
the students said the masses would never stand for the overthrow 
of socialism because they are the ones who would suffer the most 
the letter gave few details about the students living 
conditions and training but boasted about their harvest of new 
political awareness 
they have become living examples of the chinese socialist maxim 
of serving the people the students said they said they had 
learned that without the peoples army the people would have 
nothing and vowed to train ourselves into a new model of 
socialist college students

the supreme court today refused to hear a bush 
administration appeal aimed at making it costlier for an 
organization called the national security archive to compile 
information 
the archive is a nonprofit organization that collects 
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it 
available to the public in various ways 
it has filed thousands of foia requests for government records 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that gives the 
archive the same preferential status under the freedom of 
information act that other news media enjoy 
the administration claimed the archive should not have the 
status of a news organization for purposes of foia requests 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that the 
archive should be treated as a news media representative under the 
foia because it publishes some of the information it gathers itself 
news media representatives that make foia requests reimburse the 
government for the cost of copying the documents but not for the 
major additional cost of searching for the records if the archive 
did not have the status of a news organization it would have to 
reimburse the government for search costs 
the archive is headed by scott armstrong a former washington 
post reporter and coauthor of the brethren a 1979 book that 
provided a behindthescenes look at the supreme court 
the organization published a book entitled the chronology the 
documented daybyday account of the secret military assistance to 
iran and the contras and another called el salvador the 
making of us policy 19771984 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the pentagon when it sought to 
force the archive to pay more for government documents 
in reversing that decision the appeals court here said 
congress intended that an organization like the archive qualify 
as a representative of the news media 
the appeals court added however if the archives intention 
to publish works derived from the documents it requests does not 
pan out it will be open to the department of defense to argue that 
the archive is no longer a representative of the news media 
the case is us vs national security archive 891204

possible as a clear sign of the merging of the two german states 
de maiziere chairman of the topranking christian democratic 
party also said in a postelection news conference that talks with 
the west german government on monetary economic and social union 
must be accelerated 
the christian democrats received more votes than any party in 
sundays election they are the leading party in the threeparty 
alliance for germany which won 482 percent of the vote and 193 of 
the 400 parliamentary seats that was more than preelection polls 
predicted 
the vote marked the first time east germans were given a free 
choice at polls after a decade of the nazis and 41 years of 
communist dictatorship 
de maiziere reading a statement by the alliance said the group 
wanted to build a possible grand coalition 
therefore we are inviting the social democrats and the union 
of free democrats to coalition talks he said 
social democratic leader ibrahim boehme said his party which 
favors reunification at a slower pace than the alliance had 
decided against entering a coalition with the conservatives 
the social democrats were early preelection favorites but fell 
behind in polls after the alliance received massive backing from 
west german chancellor helmut kohl like the alliance kohl 
supports speedy unification 
the social democrats placed a distant second with 218 percent 
and 87 seats the union of free democrats a centrist party that 
also supports slower reunification won 53 percent or 21 seats 
boehme said the social democrats had also decided against 
entering a coalition with the communist party which sought their 
support to prevent conservatives from achieving the twothirds 
parliamentry majority 
the communists who ruled the nation with an iron fist before 
being toppled in october won 163 percent of the votes and 65 
seats the party renamed the party of democratic socialism 
cautioned that rapid reunification would hurt east germany 
the rest of the vote was divided among 20 smaller parties and 
groupings including such diverse contenders as the beer drinkers 
party it won just 02 percent of the vote not enough to have a 
seat in parliament 
interestingly the vanguard of the prodemocracy revolution that 
made the election possible fared poorly new forum in an alliance 
with two other groups ended with just 29 percent of the vote it 
will have 12 seats in parliament 
the united states and britain praised the orderly election the 
campaigning was harsh but no irregularities were reported in 
voting 
prime minister margaret thatcher called the election a new 
beginning for east germany and another step in the spread of 
democracy through central and eastern europe 
the white house called it a historic occasion there was no 
immediate comment from washington on the final results 
according to east german law the new parliament must constitute 
itself within 30 days of the election 
the new government will take part in unification talks with west 
germany and the four world war ii allies britain france the 
soviet union and the united states 
a major issue is the military strength and alignment of a 
unified germany the western powers want west germany to remain 
part of the nato military alliance the soviets and east german 
communists have called for a neutral single state 
citing the outcome kohl and de maiziere urged east germans to 
halt the exodus to west germany which sparked the fall uprising 
but has crippled the easts economy and put enormous strains on the 
west 
the german citizens have decided against every form of 
extremism kohl told a news conference most important they 
want to follow a path together with west germany that will lead 
to unification 
my message at this hour is stay home kohl said work 
with us in your villages cities and communities in your factories 
and in your local administrations to build up this beautiful 
country 
as one way of persuading people to stay in east germany the 
countries are negotiating a monetary union in which west germanys 
powerful mark would become east germanys currency as well 
in an interview with the cologne newspaper express de maiziere 
raised the prospects of the two german states forming their planned 
monetary union perhaps as early as june 
as the results poured in sunday night about 2000 ecstatic 
supporters of the christian democrats gathered at a victory party 
and chanted helmut helmut 
germans from both sides of the border turned the decaying 
industrial town of eisensach into a symbol of unity celebrating 
the east german elections as the prelude to a merger 
erhardt jung a 35yearold metal worker said he voted for the 
christian democrats because the party has drawn the clearest and 
quickest line for unification 
im looking forward to a true free market here he said 
the central economy was a farce it has to go forwards from here 
unification as quickly as possible

teachers throughout west virginia 
returned to their classrooms today after voting overwhelmingly to 
end an 11day strike 
theyre back said jackie goodwin a spokeswoman for the 
16000member west virginia education association the main 
teachers union in the state 
unions in 43 of the states 55 counties voted by large 
majorities sunday or early today to accept a backtoschool 
agreement reached by union leaders and state legislative leaders on 
saturday 
weve made our point we won a lot of respect unity and 
strength through this goodwin said the teachers have shown 
they mean business 
in morgantown school started an hour later than usual at north 
elementary school to allow teachers time to prepare for their 
pupils who seemed happy to be back 
i feel good said jorja smith a counselor at the school 
we made the public aware of the problems the schools were having 
and the problems we were having with the governor 
teachers in two counties jackson and greenbrier voted to 
return before the settlement was announced 
marion county teachers voted to suspend rather than settle 
their strike pending the outcome of a special session promised by 
legislative leaders 
if the legislature doesnt come through with what we want 
were back out said kathy jacquez president of the marion 
county education association 
teachers upset over the states refusal to grant pay raises 
walked out march 7 educators in just nine of the states 55 
counties voted not to support the strike 
on saturday legislative leaders promised leaders of the states 
two teachers unions they would ask gov gaston caperton to call a 
special session to address longterm education needs 
the settlement does not specifically address salaries which 
averaging 21904 in 198889 were ranked nearly last among the 50 
states but calls for lawmakers and union leaders to work out a 
plan for improved pay and benefits 
thats all we ever wanted an education summit to get 
something done so we dont have to keep going to charleston banging 
our heads against the house and senate doors said joseph 
suriano president of the ohio county education association 
i think weve done a heck of a job said marie hamrick 
president of the raleigh county education association 
were glad to be going back to our schools she said of 
course there are some people who are going to be unhappy unless we 
have 5000 across the board and gaston hanging from a pole 
capertons proposals to teachers were either withdrawn by the 
administration or were rejected by the education association and 
the 3000member west virginia federation of teachers 
both unions endorsed caperton in his bid for governor in 1988 
however union representatives say caperton has lost his 
credibility and teachers will have more faith in promises of action 
made by house speaker chuck chambers and senate president keith 
burdette 
teachers would much rather trust the legislators than governor 
caperton said janet zevnik president of the tyler county 
education association we have tried three times to negotiate 
with governor caperton and three times he has let us down 
caperton and legislative leaders offered teachers a 5 percent 
raise before the strike began but the offer was dropped when the 
wvea continued to threaten a walkout 
the wvea rejected a second offer saying the governor reneged on 
a promise to call a special session the third offer fell through 
when the unions rejected a sevenpoint plan from caperton they said 
contained nothing new 
wvft executive director bob brown said the tentative settlement 
reached saturday is better than the previous offers because 
lawmakers agreed to work out a plan to raise revenue for salaries 
by next fall

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a federal anticounterfeiting law may be used to crack down 
on the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the manager of a 
pennsylvania car dealership sentenced under the law to six months 
in prison 
the manager raymond j moskal was convicted last year of 
taking part in a scheme in which car odometers were turned back and 
ownership titles listing the lower mileages were obtained in 
virginia 
also convicted were al davis owner of the wholesale car 
dealership in manheim pa where moskal worked and dennis smith 
owner of a dealership in chesapeake va 
davis and smith did not appeal to the supreme court 
all three were convicted under a federal law that makes it a 
crime to transport falsely made securities across state lines or to 
make counterfeit state securities 
prosecutors said the ownership certificates from davis 
dealership were shipped to contacts in virginia who applied for 
titles in that state with the phony lower mileage figures 
the virginia titles then were sent back to davis and he 
distributed them to area dealers to sell with the used cars 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals upheld the convictions of 
the thee defendants 
the appeals court said a bonafide car title issued by a state 
qualifies as a falsely made security when the title contains false 
information 
stated mileage is a material part of a title certificate 
the appeals court said the fact that valid title is transferred 
by the certificate does not vitiate the fraud that is foisted on 
the unsuspecting customer when the falsely made document is 
introduced into commerce 
federal appeals courts elsewhere in the nation have disagreed 
with the 3rd circuit courts interpretation 
the justice department urged the high court to resolve the 
conflict the department said the court should intercede to 
promote the fair and efficient operation of the federal criminal 
justice system 
the case is moskal vs us 89964

military police guarded against looters today 
in floodravaged southern alabama where a weekend of sunny weather 
did little to diminish the devastation from two days of torrential 
rains 
the deluge and flooding killed 10 and left at least 3700 people 
homeless in alabama and the town of elba remained a muddy hole two 
days after an earthen levee ruptured along the pea river 
more than 150 alabama national guard police patrolled the town 
to enforce curfews and guard against looting in the devastated 
business district spokesman maj david bosarge said that in all 
about 300 guardsmen were dispatched to 24 locations in southeast 
alabama to assist with flood control evacuations and security 
water from nearly nonstop rain thursday and friday also swelled 
rivers and streams in georgia where authorities blamed flooding 
for four deaths in auto accidents 
some alabama rivers were expected to crest at 20 feet or more 
above flood level today or tuesday while some rivers in southern 
georgia were not expected to crest until friday the national 
weather service said 
after a sunny dry weekend temperatures dropped the national 
weather service warned that a new storm front would bring freezing 
temperatures and possibly snow to alabamas northern tip and 
nearfreezing temperatures and light rain to south alabama 
though the pea river was one of the few starting to recede in 
the state sunday water still nipped at elbas downtown rooftops 
1500 of the 4400 residents were homeless and roads homes 
schools and businesses were paralyzed as much as 16 inches of rain 
fell in southern alabama last week 
elba mayor fred moore estimated the cleanup would cost millions 
of dollars 
ive never seen anything like it said us rep bill 
dickinson who toured the devastated area by helicopter sunday i 
cannot begin to imagine everything thats been lost or damaged 
most southern alabama rivers continued rising today as flood 
waters drained toward the gulf of mexico a national weather 
service official said 
authorities reported about 500 people were forced from their 
homes in the montgomery area as the muddy alabama river rose to 19 
feet above flood stage 
in selma about 200 people fled their homes as the river headed 
toward the level reached in a record 1961 flood hundreds more 
could be evacuated by tuesday afternoon when the river is expected 
to crest 13 feet above flood level said emergency management 
director warren rhoades 
the choctawhatchee river was 21 feet above flood stage in the 
southeast alabama town of newton about 30 miles east of elba 
sheriffs deputies said some 500 people had been forced from their 
homes since friday in newton and surrounding dale county 
evacuations in five other counties brought the total number of 
evacuations to more than 3700 authorities said 
the waters in elba appeared to have receded perhaps a foot or 
two on sunday but a swift current continued to flow swiftly 
through a 100foot hole on the north side of the levee and back 
into the pea river through a large crack on the south side 
the water was up to the windows of lela wilsons onestory home 
which she moved into about a week ago 
it hurts it honestly hurts it seems like everything you work 
for you wind up losing she said 
for older elba residents the deluge brought back memories of a 
great flood that devastated the town on march 14 1929 
fleetwood carnley 71 recalled that his family had to seek 
refuge in their loft but now their home is submerged 
we didnt get anything out but what we wore carnley said 
i just couldnt conceive it happening 
col larry bonine the district engineer for the army corps of 
engineers in mobile said it was too early to determine what caused 
the levee to rupture 
about 45 miles downstream in geneva emergency workers shored up 
another levee and continued evacuating residents at least 450 
people were forced out there 
margaret mixon emergency management director for geneva county 
said officials believed the geneva levee would hold 
but she added i guess elba was pretty confident too 
state troopers said six people drowned friday night in covington 
county when a car fell into a rainswollen creek where a bridge had 
washed out 
two more people met a similar fate saturday night in neighboring 
escambia county and a third man died there when he walked into a 
flooded area to check on his parents 
another man was found dead in his car in prichard on sunday 
morning on a road that had been barricaded since friday due to 
7footdeep water police said 
in georgia authorities expected the ocmulgee river to crest at 
12 feet above flood level today in macon the flint river is 
expected to crest at about 11 feet above flood level by friday in 
albany 
the georgia state patrol blamed the heavy rain and floods for 
car crashes that killed three people near lumpkin on saturday and 
one woman in henry county late friday night

the government today announced a 105 
percent increase in military spending and officials said the boost 
was necessary due to growing tensions with pakistan along a 
disputed northwestern border 
finance minister madhu dandavate presented the 93 billion 
defense budget to parliament as part of the governments budget for 
199091 
this increase in defense expenditure is not of our choice 
dandavate said it is a direct result of the situation on our 
borders 
the hike in defense spending follows two months of fighting 
between moslem miliants and government troops in the northern 
jammukashmir state where moslems want to secede from predominantly 
hindu india 
at least 184 people have been killed in the latest round of 
violence that flared up jan 20 following a government crackdown 
pakistan controls the western part of kashmir and has claimed 
the larger indiancontrolled area because of its predominantly 
moslem population pakistan has openly pledged support for the 
militants 
the secession movement has been alternately simmering and 
flaring since 1947 when the old princely state of kashmir then 
governed by a hindu ruler opted to merge with india instead of 
mostly moslem pakistan 
pakistan and india have fought three wars since independence 
india with a population of 880 million has an armed force of 
136 million men smaller only than those of the soviet union 
china and the united states 
the budget the first by prime minister vp singhs government 
which came to power 3 months ago calls for 55 billion in 
spending and revenues of 51 billion 
the budget calls for a debt of 4 billion

a man described as having a 
soldieroffortune mentality was being sought today for 
questioning in the bombing of a us drug enforcement 
administration office 
local state and federal officials were hunting for jeffrey a 
matthews 23 formerly named jeff ciganek in connection with the 
saturday morning firebombing of the local dea office 
matthews brother john lewis ciganek 22 was arrested sunday 
morning in the florida keys for questioning in the same case 
the bombing took place two days after the brothers were indicted 
on two counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and a month after 
federal drug agents told local sheriffs deputies that matthews had 
threatened dea property during a drug investigation 
the search for the brothers began when they were declared 
fugitives after their indictment thursday but picked up after the 
bombing 
ciganek was arrested in tavernier just south of key largo on 
the drug charges lee county sheriff john mcdougall said sunday 
florida highway patrol officers turned ciganek over to fbi agents 
who returned him to the lee county jail 
earlier in the day fbi agent brian kensel a spokesman for the 
fbi team leading the investigation into the bombing said no 
charges had been filed against ciganek over the bombing 
kensel said the fbi wanted to question the brothers about the 
bombing but he declined to label them or anyone else as prime 
suspects 
the search for matthews has involved officers of the fbi the 
florida department of law enforcement and the federal bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms among other agencies 
mcdougall also summoned 50 deputies from six other florida 
counties to help provide protection for at least 13 prosecutors 
judges and law enforcement officials who took part in a joint task 
force investigating and prosecuting drug dealers in the 
southwestern florida county 
were certainly prepared for a showdown with him mcdougall 
said of matthews the ball is in his court now if he wants to 
surrender thats fine but if he wants to engage in other options 
well accommodate him 
mcdougall described matthews as elusive saying he always has 
been proud of the fact that nobody knew exactly where he lived 
i think he has a fixation with being a mafia don the 
sheriff said hes into that neonazi philosophic bent hes into 
that neonazitype soldieroffortune mentality 
at the dea office an fbi forensic team continued searching 
through the charred rubble and was expected to finish its 
investigation at the site today according to kensel 
the blast appeared to have been triggered by a pipe bomb that 
ignited some kind of liquid accelerant probably gasoline he 
said 
no one was injured in the bombing but the blast and resultant 
fire destroyed the onestory building causing damage estimated at 
4 million 
last month dea agents told sheriffs deputies that matthews had 
threatened to damage dea property and cars the fort myers 
newspress reported sunday that report was filed after a dea 
vehicle parked outside the office was vandalized feb 24

the supreme court today agreed to decide how 
much authority federal judges have to rule in some labor disputes 
the court said it will hear an appeal by two workers fired by a 
michigan company ring screw works 
arthur groves was fired for allegedly excessive unexcused 
absences from work bobby evans was dismissed for allegedly 
falsifying company records 
both men denied the charges but lost grievance complaints 
against the company they then sued the firm for firing them 
without due cause in violation of the federal labor relations 
management act 
the united automobile workers union joined the lawsuits on the 
side of the employees 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld a ruling 
by a federal judge who threw out the suits 
the appeals court said the uaw contract with ring screw works 
provides that a strike is the unions only recourse when workers 
lose grievances the appeals court said the only exception that 
would permit the workers to sue would be if they accused the union 
of breaching its duty to represent them fairly 
the fired workers made no such accusation 
the union members had voted against striking after groves and 
evans lost their grievances 
groves evans and the uaw said in their appeals to the supreme 
court that federal appeals courts elsewhere have disagreed with the 
6th circuit court and ruled that federal judges have authority to 
rule in such suits they asked the justices to resolve the conflict 
the case is groves vs ring screw works 891166

two thieves with a talent for disguise and a taste 
for rembrandt and degas stole 11 paintings valued at upwards of 
100 million in a daring theft from the isabella stewart gardner 
museum 
but experts say the paintings are so priceless in one sense 
theyre worthless any legitimate collector or dealer would 
recognize them and wouldnt pay a penny they say 
people make pilgrimages to see these paintings scholars and 
art lovers know where they belong constance lowenthal executive 
director of the international foundation for art research said 
sunday 
the theft occurred around 1 am sunday when two men apparently 
convinced museum guards they were police then bound them with tape 
and made their way to the museums dutch room 
it was seven hours before a cleaning crew discovered the theft 
the heist was a professional job said fbi agent paul 
cavanagh this is one of those thefts where people actually spent 
some time researching and took specific things 
he said the investigation would not be limited to the united 
states 
it is the biggest old master theft in this country by far 
said ms lowenthal whose organization tracks art thefts 
the gardner museum is a treasure house she said 
everything in it is exceedingly valuable and firstrate and 
superb 
the value of the missing works which included an ancient 
chinese beaker was in the hundreds of millions of dollars said 
karen haas the museums curator the police report gave the value 
as at least 100 million 
its not overstating the case to say that these are priceless 
works said william robinson curator of drawings for harvard 
universitys fogg art museum a loss of any of these works is 
significant 
but their true value cannot be determined because they have not 
been on the market for nearly a century 
the works taken were 
the concert by jan vermeer 
a lady and a gentleman in black the storm on the sea of 
galilee and a selfportrait by rembrandt 
landscape with an obelisk by govaert flinck another 
17thcentury dutchman 
leaving the paddock procession outside florence 
three mounted jockeys program for an artistic soiree and 
another less complete work by the same name by edgar degas 
at tortonis by edouard manet 
a chinese bronze beaker from the shang dynasty 12001100 
bc 
the rembrandt selfportrait and the storm on the sea of 
galilee the artists only seascape were especially important 
robinson said 
he said the theft of the vermeer also was a major loss because 
only about 35 of his works are known to exist 
experts said the motive for stealing such wellknown pieces 
could be ransom or acquisitiveness by a selfish wealthy art lover 
you hear legends of deranged collectors but mostly i think 
its the stuff of spy novels said peter sutton curator of 
european paintings at the nearby museum of fine arts 
gardner museum spokesman corey cronin refused to say whether the 
works were insured 
the gardner museum which sits along the graceful green parkway 
called the fenway has a stateoftheart security system and had 
two security guards on duty at the time of the theft cronin said 
he said no apparent damage was done to the museum a fourstory 
building with a courtyard and a skylight 
the museum was built to house the collection of the woman whose 
name it bears the widow of john lowell gardner the wealthy son of 
the last of bostons east india merchants 
mrs gardner lived on the top floor of the mansion until her 
death in 1924 at age 85 but she opened her home and its collection 
to the public long before then in 1903 
the museum collection contains 290 paintings 280 pieces of 
sculpture and various religious objects period furniture 
textiles ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and 
political figures 
the last major reported theft involving a musuem occurred in 
paris on june 1 when a georges braque worth an estimated 3 
million was taken from the national museum of modern art at the 
pompidou center

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
unusual appeal by tennessee prosecutors in the case of a man 
convicted of sexually abusing his 5yearold nephew 
the justices without comment let stand a tennessee supreme 
court ruling that upheld sam pilkeys 1986 conviction and 25year 
prison sentence 
the state court ruled against pilkey who was 21 when he stood 
trial even though it found that his constitutional right to 
confront all adverse witnesses was violated because jurors were 
shown a videotaped statement by the young boy 
prosecutors introduced the videotape as evidence the boy did 
not testify in person but apparently was available to be called by 
pilkeys lawyer for crossexamination he was not 
the state supreme court last august ruled that pilkeys right 
was violated but that the violation represented harmless error 
even though pilkeys conviction had been upheld tennessee 
attorney general charles w burson appealed the state courts 
ruling he urged the justices to rule that showing the videotape 
did not violate pilkeys rights 
the supreme court last january agreed to decide in cases from 
maryland and idaho whether people accused of child abuse have the 
right to at least one facetoface confrontation with their young 
accusers 
a decision is expected by july 
the case acted on today is tennessee vs pilkey 89773

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
owners of a north carolina adult film and book store who hired a 
college professor to help them rebut obscenity charges 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that had the 
effect of exposing the professor to an obscenity prosecution if he 
surveyed people about their reactions to sexually explicit material 
cinema blue of charlotte nc and its owners jim st john and 
curtis renee peterson were charged in 1988 with disseminating 
obscenity st john and peterson were convicted last year and each 
was sentenced to six years in prison their store was fined 
250000 
prior to their trial the two men hired ohio state university 
sociology professor joseph e scott as an expert witness 
scott planned to show the allegedly obscene material to randomly 
selected groups of adults in mecklenburg county he also planned to 
conduct telephone surveys aimed at determining community attitudes 
toward the material 
the north carolina obscenity law bans sexually explicit material 
lacking serious literary artistic political or scientific 
value if it also is patently offensive and appeals to the 
prurient interest in sex as judged by contemporary community 
standards 
peter s gilchrist iii the local district attorney warned the 
cinema blue owners that scott could be prosecuted if he conductted 
the surveys 
a state judge refused to shield scott from prosecution and st 
john and peterson turned to the federal courts for help 
us district judge james b mcmillan ruled in their favor 
issuing an injunction that barred gilchrist from prosecuting the 
professor for conducting the surveys 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals last year overruled 
the judge in the unique circumstances present here the 
appeals court said the judge should not have interfered in a 
pending state prosecution 
scott was not immediately threatened with any irremediable 
harm for his remedy for avoiding state prosecution lay entirely 
within his hands and could be invoked with no sacrifice of any 
federal rights personal to him the appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected charges that the adult book 
stores proprietors were victims of unlawful discrimination by 
gilchrist the store owners said gilchrist permitted 
antipornography groups and others to conduct surveys similar to 
the one scott wanted to undertake 
the case is cinema blue vs gilchrist 891213

chinas national legislature meets tuesday in an 
annual session expected to be devoid of controversy and laden with 
shows of loyalty to government political and economic policies 
unlike previous sessions of the national peoples congress when 
mild debate and scatterings of negative votes were taken as signs 
of emerging democracy the emphasis at the first meeting since the 
june 1989 crackdown on demonstrators will be on political stability 
and obedience 
wan li chairman of the congress standing committee has called 
on the nearly 3000 deputies to the 15day national meeting to 
follow the guidance of the ruling communist party and make 
correct policies for the good of all chinese people 
communist party members who make up about twothirds of the 
delegates reportedly have been told to refrain from making 
controversial statements or proposals at the plenum 
the congress in recent years has tried to shake off its 
rubberstamp image by openly debating and sometimes amending 
legislation but the party still holds ultimate authority to 
initiate and decide policy 
tuesdays highlight will be a stateofthenation address by 
premier li peng in which he is expected to hail the suppression of 
the prodemocracy student movement and reassert chinas commitment 
to communist party rule and socialism 
li also will pledge to continue an austerity program that has 
brought inflation under control but may announce some concessions 
such as the easing of tight money policies to pull the economy out 
of a serious slump 
li a political hardliner and economic conservative is 
unlikely to reveal plans for new economic reforms instead of 
marketoriented price reforms now politically inexpedient he may 
call for tighter management of prices 
on foreign policy matters li is expected to express chinas 
interest in good relations with all countries including the soviet 
union and the united states but stress that china will not be 
influenced by rapid changes in other socialist countries or bow to 
us demands for human rights reforms 
the deputies also will hear a report from the finance minister 
on the governments precarious financial state and approve the 1990 
budget 
attempts to balance the budget have been made more difficult by 
intense competition for limited funds bureaucrats seeking money 
for struggling education social welfare and infrastructure 
programs are vying with the military which carries more clout 
since the army put down the demonstrations and wants to reverse the 
trend of falling defense budgets 
the deputies are expected to pass with little debate a basic law 
to govern hong kong after the british colony reverts to chinese 
rule in 1997 and an amendment to the joint venture law 
guaranteeing that foreign enterprises in china will not be 
nationalized 
the congress will approve several government personnel changes 
but the standing committee spokesman yao guang on monday dampened 
speculation about major displacements including the removal of li 
the scheduled changes he said do not correspond with the 
rumors and guesses and reports of some newspapers in hong kong 
he said 
li is widely disliked because of his key role in the violent 
military suppression of the prodemocracy movement and his economic 
policies that have led to factory closures and unemployment there 
has been speculation the party would demote him to shore up its 
shaky reputation among the populace 
hong kong and foreign reports also have suggested the party 
would have a nonparty member named vice premier as part of its 
recent pledges to give those outside the party a greater voice in 
the government 
yao said the congress would take up the request by senior leader 
deng xiaoping to step down as chairman of the state central 
military commission deng still regarded as the most powerful 
person in china resigned in november as head of the largely 
overlapping party central military commission ending his official 
party duties 
communist party general secretary jiang zemin who succeeded 
deng in the party post is expected to get the state job as well 
yao said jiangs predecessor zhao ziyang who was purged form 
all party posts in june for allegedly supporting the democracy 
movement would not attend the congress 
zhao a deputy from sichuan province has asked for leave 
yao said he has not been seen in public since a tearful meeting 
with hunger strikers on tiananmen square on may 19 1989

nasa said today that its engineers have 
worried for years that astronauts will have to spend too much time 
in the harsh environment of open space to repair and maintain the 
space station that is set for construction in the mid90s 
agency officials were preparing a response to a frontpage 
article in the new york times today that said the station cant be 
built as designed because its vast array of parts would start to 
break down before the station was completed 
the first elements of the 30 billion station are to be carried 
into orbit beginning early in 1995 and completion is scheduled for 
1999 the times said nasa investigators found that construction 
would be only 60 percent to 70 percent complete before preventive 
maintenance would have to begin 
the times said investigators concluded that if built according 
to plan the space station would have more than 5500 external 
parts that would need to be replaced if they failed that would 
require space walks or what nasa calls evas short for 
extravehicular activity 
in terms of the program addressing evas that is not a new 
thing its not a new problem that has suddenly been discovered 
said space station spokesman mark hess 
the times said such space walks would total 2200 hours for 
maintenance but hess said that estimate includes a lot of time in 
which astronauts would not actually be outside of the relative 
safety of the station 
anther spokesman james mcculla said eva time is a matter 
that space station designers have been working on for years 
he said that working out methods to cut down the eva time is an 
integral part of design review activities and therefore will be 
an important matter to be worked on for days to come

census bureau workers will head for 
flophouses missions and cheap hotels tuesday night then theyll 
look for people in the streets and alleyways and as the sun comes 
up theyll be outside abandoned buildings to see who comes out 
it will be the most ambitious effort ever to count the homeless 
and the first in which the government tries to count people living 
in the streets 
the government needs to know about everyone and this is a 
chance for the homeless to say look we exist were part of this 
country cynthia taeuber special assistant for selected 
populations at the census bureau said monday 
although most americans will receive census forms asking from a 
dozen to a few dozen questions the main effort for the homeless 
will be just to get them counted explained taeuber 
the new effort reflects a change in american society with the 
homeless more numerous and more visible than ever 
dealing with the problem though has been muddled by the 
scarcity of information on how many people have no homes estimates 
have ranged from 250000 to 3 million or more 
narrowing down that difference will involve an estimated 15000 
census workers and cost 27 million taeuber said 
census officials are looking for homeless in every city of at 
least 50000 people in addition census asked smaller communities 
if they had a homeless population and if they sent in the 
information to us were there said taeuber 
a decade ago the census bureau sent workers to flophouses and 
shelters and this special count is still known as snight 
originally that stood for shelter night now its expanded to 
shelter and street night 
there are a lot of people that are homeless that dont even 
come to a shelter i stayed on the streets for days before i 
came here said toylce cheatham in a recent interview at a 
salvation army shelter in detroit 
workers will try to ask the homeless some questions but they 
will simply observe and estimate answers for those sleeping or who 
are not in a state of mind to answer questions or who refuse 
taeuber explained 
advocates for the homeless are cooperating with the census in 
many cities but a few are resisting the effort claiming the count 
will be too low 
because of problems in finding all the homeless and concerns 
about worker safety taeuber admits she expects the tally to be 
conservative 
but it will at least provide the first formal count of people in 
the streets 
in the end however the census bureau wont announce any 
specific number of homeless since officials decline to try and 
define that term instead the bureau will simply report that its 
special count found so many people in shelters so many in 
missions so many in flophouses so many walking or sleeping on the 
streets and so forth 
beginning tuesday at 6 pm workers will visit public and 
private emergency shelters hotels and motels used to shelter the 
homeless and other hotels costing less than 12 per night this 
effort is expected to last until about midnight covering a period 
when people are generally settled for the night 
then from 2 am to 4 am census workers will travel the 
streets checking places not intended for habitation but where 
homeless people may be found after that until about 8 am 
workers will be outside abandoned buildings where they believe some 
homeless people may live 
michael alakel who said he has been homeless for three years in 
hartford conn thinks census workers will have problems finding 
people living in dumpsters cars graveyards and under bridges 
among other places 
you have to know where to find these people they are not 
going to come out of their hiding places so they can be counted 
said alakel 
census officials concede they will miss some but they have been 
working with with municipal officials and local groups that assist 
the homeless in order to identify the most likely places to look 
during the special count 
in new york city alone some 2100 sites have been identified as 
likely locations for the homeless including more than 300 public 
and private shelters 
security can be a problem for workers taking to streets and 
shelters in the middle of the night and they will be dispatched in 
groups of two or three they have been told to leave any area where 
problems develop said taeuber 
because of safety questions she explained the decision was 
made not to enter abandoned buildings even though people may be 
sleeping in them 
in tompkins square park on new yorks lower east side a 
homeless man who declined to give his name said the early morning 
hours are not a good time to ask people questions around here i 
think thats stupid

traditional st josephs day appearance in this old mission town 
today as hundreds of residents and visitors cheered the forktailed 
birds return 
from the mission church courtyard paul arbiso 96 and frank 
velasquez 68 spotted a small group of swallows flying above the 
214yearold mission the two hometown residents pulled ropes to 
ring the four church bells to formally celebrate the birds 
migratory return from argentina 
a handful of swallows and dozens of pigeons flew from the

the bells 
its fun its like playing pulling the ropes and all

off to reveal a clear blue sky 
arbiso like others present said the numbers of swallows were 
decreasing 
twenty or thirty years ago they were all over flocks of them

date back to 1776 that was the year father junipero serra founded 
the mission as part of spains effort to spread the roman catholic 
faith in the new world 
the traditional belief that the birds return every st josephs 
day gained widespread fame because of a hit 1939 song when the

pope john paul ii visiting one of 
italys most important technical centers warned monday about 
making technology the idol of modern times 
the pope said the dignity of human beings can not be 
sacrificed to the machine and that unemployment resulting from 
advanced technology cant be morally accepted 
its necessary to resist the temptation to make technology a 
new idol technology and its products are not all how can we 
forget for example the polluting effects linked to technological 
development and questions about the destination of 
technological products the pope asked workers during a visit to 
the olivetti and fiatlancia plants 
the pope visited the olivetti computer factory in ivrea and the 
fiatlancia auto plant in nearby chivasso in northern italy to mark 
the feast day of st joseph considered the patron of workers 
the pontiff frequently has met with groups of workers and spoken 
of his own experiences as an employee in a quarry in his native 
poland before he became a priest 
the pope has come here to acknowledge and pay homage to the 
dignity of each worker john paul said in his address to olivetti 
employees 
john paul ii conceded that technology can be an ally of humans 
and said that technological advancement is irreversible 
but he stressed that the principle of mans preeminence over 
technology must be remembered 
automation and sophisticated equipment are causing not a few 
problems for workers their families and society he added 
speaking in italian 
in ivrea the pope was welcomed by carlo de benedetti who heads 
a financial empire including the olivetti corporation 
fiats chairman gianni agnelli stood at the popes side in an 
open van during the visit to lancia 
production at the lancia plant which employs 5000 workers and 
makes more than 500 cars a day was suspended during the popes 
speech in a huge tent 
the pope called on the lancia workers to show solidarity with 
immigrants who have been streaming into italy by the thousands in 
recent years from northern africa and other impoverished areas 
each man must have the right to seek working opportunities 
also beyond national and continental borders he said 
humanity by now lives in a single village because of the 
growing interdependence among humans and nations

isabella stewart gardner founder and lone patron 
of the gardner museum assembled an art collection unique among 
american galleries and a museum stamped with her own incorrigible 
eccentric personality 
extravagant selfish ambitious and daring to the point of 
imprudence mrs gardner as she was always called was known for 
her ability to swig beer and heft an ax like the men of the day 
she was a woman who did everything a proper boston woman of the 
late 19th and early 20th centuries would not do 
in taking a priceless cache of art from her former home on 
sunday two thieves violated mrs gardners cardinal rule by moving 
her paintings from their assigned locations 
she was an amazing character said cleveland amory author 
of the proper bostonians an account of the citys 
brahmins she was a very individual person 
tales of mrs gardners exploits abound she was known to walk 
down the citys tremont street with her pet lion rex on a leash 
when she gave parties at her beacon street home she greeted her 
guests not from the door but perched on a branch in a tree 
wealth was never novel to mrs gardner she was the daughter of 
a successful new york dry goods merchant and married john lowell 
gardner son of the last of bostons east india merchants in 1860 
but while other turnofthecentury boston bluebloods played 
down their riches mrs gardner flaunted hers 
warned by other highsociety boston women that she should keep 
her jewels tucked away in a safe deposit box she had two of her 
largest diamonds set on gold wires so she could wear them like 
antennae 
in 1898 shortly after her husband died she had a nervous 
breakdown when she recovered doctors suggested she take up a 
hobby which became her museum 
a 15th century venetian palace was dismantled and brought to 
boston where mrs gardner supervised its incorporation into her 
home and museum the museum is frozen in time nothing may be 
altered nothing may be moved from its assigned place nothing may 
be loaned nothing may be sold and nothing may be added to the 
collection 
peter sutton curator of bostons museum of fine arts called 
the gardner museum one of three great art collections assembled by 
turnofthecentury aristocrats he said the others are those of 
the frick in new york and of attorney john g johnson now at the 
philadelphia museum of art 
the gardner is a testament to another era sutton said 
its not only important because of the works it houses but 
important to the history of american art collecting its a great 
tribute to old style bluechip collecting 
while mrs gardner footed the bill for the museums 
construction she wasnt afraid to get her hands dirty she 
personally supervised the building to the point of climbing on 
scaffolds to mix paint to the precise color she sought 
whenever she worked a trumpeter stood nearby to summon workmen 
one note for the architect another for the plumber and so on 
she was there every damn day amory said once she 
grabbed an ax to hew a heavy beam to show workmen how it should be 
done 
the official opening of the museum was celebrated with a gala on 
jan 1 1903 only workmen had seen the inside of the palace 
confronted with the problem of testing the acoustics in the music 
room before the ball mrs gardner had a characteristic solution 
she contacted the perkins institute for the blind and gathered an 
audience of blind children for an afternoon concert and test run 
mrs gardner lived in the top floor of the mansion until her 
death in 1924 at age 85 but she opened her home and its collection 
to the public long before then 
she built the collection with the help of a young lithuanian 
immigrant named bernard berenson who became one of the most 
respected art historians 
on her own gardner convinced t jefferson coolidge to loan her 
sargents el jaleo and then never gave it back to protect her 
stolen prize she built a cloister around the work making it 
nearly impossible to remove 
the collection contains 290 paintings and 280 pieces of 
sculpture as well as religious objects period furniture 
textiles ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and 
political figures 
amory said the museum is unique because it bore the indelible 
stamp of mrs gardners personality 
others like frick had more money and bigger collections 
amory said but the personality of the gardner museum is hers 
its one persons taste and one persons castle

membership of a unified germany in nato would 
upset the balance of power in europe and should not be allowed a 
soviet spokesman said monday 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said at a news 
briefing that the soviet union respected the will of the people of 
east germany but added that they must in turn respect the rights 
of others 
a conservative coalition that swept to victory in east german 
elections sunday strongly favors speedy reunification with west 
germany 
we respect the expressed will of the citizens of east germany 
an allied sovereign state gerasimov said respecting this 
right of choice we proceed from the premise that in turn they 
will respect the legitimate interests of the soviet union and other 
countries 
gerasimov said germans had the right of unification but he 
repeated the soviet position that a unified germany could not 
become a member of the north atlantic treaty organization 
he said the process of unification should come about in 
carefully planned stages with cooperation between the east and 
west it should not be a member of nato gerasimov said that 
would upset the balance of europe 
gerasimov said the soviets wanted both parts of a unified 
germany to be demilitarized and the problems of european security 
should be approached with a view of overcoming the inertia of 
bloc approaches

former burlington mayor bernard sanders 
hoping to build upon his strong showing in the 1988 race said 
today that he would run again for congress this year 
sanders who gained wide attention as the nations only 
socialist mayor during his eight years as burlington mayor said he 
opted for congress instead of running for governor as he had 
considered doing because of concerns over national and 
international issues 
i can honestly say that there is no race that i have ever run 
in which i feel more enthusiastic more confident and which has 
for me a greater sense of urgency he said in his announcement 
sanders came in second in the 1988 race for vermonts only seat 
in the us house 
the race was won by republican peter smith with 41 percent 
sanders running as an independent gained 38 percent while the 
democratic nominee former vermont house majority leader paul 
poirier received only 19 percent 
sanders who was burlington mayor from 198189 considers 
himself a socialist but runs as an independent and said he would do 
so again this year 
it appears at this time however that the democrats will not 
put up a strong candidate and perhaps will not put up any 
candidate at all against smith giving sanders something he has 
never had in a statewide race a headtohead contest 
but a race against smith now an incumbent with support among 
democrats as well as republicans will not be easy the league for 
conservation voters has already endorsed smith even without 
knowing who he would have as an opponent sanders began his 
political career in vermont with the liberty union a third 
political party that is unique to the state but he left that party 
and statewide politics to run for mayor of burlington in 1981 he 
ousted the incumbent and went on to serve eight years 
in 1986 he returned to statewide politics with a gubernatorial 
run in which he finished third behind gov madeleine kunin and 
smith then the lieutenant governor

secretary of state james a baker iii 
arrived today in namibia where he aims to mix celebration with 
negotiations to end apartheid in south africa and to achieve a 
ceasefire in angola 
in six fastpaced days baker plans to visit three countries 
including south africa the first secretary of state to go there 
since 1978 he will fly to cape town on thursday to show us 
appreciation for the preliminary steps taken by president fw de 
klerk and to try to drive him to go faster 
to underscore us support for the black movement baker will go 
on friday to soweto the black township outside johannesburg for 
talks there with desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop and 
other black leaders soweto has been the cradle of the 
antiapartheid movement 
baker joined world leaders gathered in windhoek the capital 
for independence ceremonies namibia was pried from south africas 
control with the help of us diplomacy that is now shifting its 
focus to pretoria where a white minority government is being urged 
to dismantle racial segregation 
baker made no comment on arriving at the airport and he and his 
party were whisked away in a convoy of cars 
baker will meet in windhoek with nelson mandela the deputy 
president of the african national congress and then in cape town 
with de klerk and foreign minister rf botha the purpose of our 
seeing these gentlemen is to encourage negotiations to move as 
rapidly as possible and to see what we can do to contribute to 
that a senior us official said 
baker also will hold talks in windhoek with jose eduoardo dos 
santos the president of angola a potentially rich african nation 
with which the united states has no diplomatic relations baker 
intends to urge him to negotiate for a share of the government with 
jonas savimbi the usbacked leader of the unita insurgents in a 
14year war 
he will see savimbi in kinshasa zaire before flying home on 
saturday 
bakers aides made clear before his departure that the bush 
administration would not yield to mandelas demands for stiffer 
sanctions against south africa and would not recognize angola until 
the luanda government settles with the rebels 
but baker also is ready to assure mandela that the 
administration would keep pressuring de klerk who will hold 
preliminary negotiations april 11 with black leaders to free all 
political prisoners and end a 3year state of emergency 
in angola a military standoff since december in navinga a 
savimbi stronghold encourages baker to promote a ceasefire 
the country has developed a private economy and ships 75 percent 
of its oil to the united states through chevron and conoco but the 
united states alone among major western countries has withheld 
recognition 
soviet support for angola and cuban troops in the country were 
the biggest reasons 
about half of the 50000 cubans have left under a complex 
agreement that also ended south african control over namibia the 
rest are supposed to depart by next year 
but soviet aid even though it is decreasing continues to be 
humongous a senior us official said insisting on anonymity 
were talking about a decrease from about a billion dollars a 
year to 600 million 
were not asking for the overthrow of the government the 
official said we are not asking for any type of regime were 
not asking that jonas savimbi be made president of angola 
all were asking for is for the government of angola to 
reconcile with a major dissident organization which represents a 
significant number of angolan people the official said in the 
event of a new political order we will be very happy to bow 
out

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki is 
coming to the united states to seek support for the solidarityled 
governments demand that a treaty guaranteeing polands western 
border be signed before germany unifies 
the former solidarity editor and political prisoner leaves 
warsaw on tuesday for a sixday visit to the united states with a 
oneday stop in canada it will be mazowieckis longest abroad 
since he was elected in august to lead the first noncommunist 
government in the east bloc 
i dont need to stress the significance of the visit for 
poland to a country which is the worlds no 1 superpower 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said recently 
outlining the goals of the visit 
mazowiecki achieved one aim of his trip when the four victorious 
world war ii allies and the two germanys last week decided to allow 
poland to take part in sessions of twoplusfour talks that 
concern polands security 
now mazowiecki will be pushing for us backing of his 
governments demand that a treaty guaranteeing polands western 
border be initialed by east germany and west germany before 
unification and then ratified by a unified germany 
treaties commit the germanys to respect the oder and neisse 
rivers as polands western border but a unified germany is not 
bound by those terms 
poles are concerned by some in germany who urge reunification be 
sought within the 1937 borders that included about onethird of 
presentday poland 
warsaw has not been satisfied by a resolution backed by west 
german chancellor helmut kohl asking parliaments in west germany 
and east germany to adopt declarations saying a united germany 
should sign a treaty affirming the poles right to live in secure 
borders 
we would like the us to act towards stabilization of 
transformations taking place in europe and to support as it has 
always done the polish interests particularly those concerning 
the process of german unification janusz onyszkiewicz former 
solidarity spokesman and now a deputy to parliament told the pap 
news agency monday 
germany unity developments in central europe security and 
defense issues and economic cooperation are expected to be the 
topics of talks between mazowiecki and president bush 
prospects for polishamerican cooperation are better today 
than at any time since the end of world war ii this new attitude 
results from what happened and is happening in poland and that 
washington has appreciated the importance of polish events said 
a commentary monday in the zycie warszawy newspaper 
mazowiecki also is to meet with us defense secretary dick 
cheney treasury secretary nicholas brady members of congress and 
other top us officials 
mazowiecki a lawyer practicing roman catholic and top adviser 
to solidarity leader lech walesa for a decade is expected to focus 
on talks rather than the public appearances that characterized 
walesas trip to the united states in november 
niezabitowska said mazowiecki is to address the council on 
foreign relations and meet with representatives of jewish 
organizations and groups of american poles 
mazowiecki also will be pursuing increased financial aid and 
cooperation for his radical economic reform program 
with the blessing of the world bank and the international 
monetary fund the solidarityled government introduced a 
promarket reform plan jan 1 that lifted most price controls 
ended many government subsidies to industry and made the zloty a 
convertible currency 
niezabitowska said mazowiecki plans to extend polands thanks 
for the help it has received from the united states in direct aid 
and in dealings with the paris club the world bank and the 
international monetary fund 
further assistance in restructuring polands 41 billion debt 
31 billion of which is owed to the united states also is 
expected to be discussed 
mazowiecki also will be seeking a reduction of restrictions on 
technology imports a broadening of us business investment in 
poland and expansion of credit guarantees 
warsaw would like washington to lift travel restrictions placed 
on polish diplomats following the 1981 martiallaw crackdown to 
crush solidarity 
it also would like to open a consulate in california where many 
polish emigres have settled as well as an easing of us 
restrictions on issuing visas to poles niezabitowska said more 
than 60 percent of all polish applications for us visas are 
rejected 
mazowiecki will travel to canada for one day after his us trip 
for talks with canadian officials

the supreme court rejected the advice of 31 
states monday as it left intact 30 million in fines against puerto 
rico for failing to relieve prison overcrowding 
the justices without comment refused to disturb rulings that 
the government of the island commonwealth failed to respond fast 
enough to a federal judges order that the overcrowding cease 
most states are under similar court orders to improve prison 
conditions 
officials for 31 states told the high court that such strict 
enforcement of federal court penalties could delay voluntary prison 
reforms 
the states are alabama arizona arkansas california delaware 
florida hawaii idaho illinois indiana kansas kentucky 
louisiana maryland michigan mississippi missouri nevada new 
mexico north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island south 
dakota tennessee texas vermont utah virginia west virginia 
and wyoming 
the court issued orders in more than 200 cases monday as it 
returned from a twoweek recess justice william j brennan was 
missing from the bench reportedly suffering from a stomach flu 
since thursday 
in other matters the court 
rejected arguments that a college professor hired to help the 
two owners of a north carolina adult movie and book store fight 
obscenity charges wrongly was inhibited from surveying charlotte 
area residents about their opinions of sexually explicit materials 
agreed to decide in a case from pennsylvania whether a federal 
anticounterfeiting law may be used to crack down on the sale of 
cars with falsified mileage readings 
refused to become embroiled in the continuing fight between 
environmentalists and the bush administration over oregon timber 
and the northern spotted owl 
heard arguments over the obligation of us banks with branch 
offices overseas to pay depositors after foreign governments seize 
or freeze those accounts 
robert h bork the former federal judge whose supreme court 
nomination was rejected by the senate in 1987 represented citibank 
in that case marking what was believed to be the first time a 
failed supreme court nominee subsequently appeared before the high 
court 
the puerto rico case stems from a 1979 lawsuit a federal judge 
ruled the next year that each inmate initially must be provided at 
least 35 square feet of cell space and ultimately 55 square feet 
in dormitories and 70 square feet in individual cells 
commonwealth officials in 1986 agreed to comply with the court 
order and began to expand prison capacity 
but in july 1987 the officials were fined for failing to provide 
35 square feet of space per prisoner by november the fines 
approached a total of 30 million 
gov rafael hernandez colon and other officials said tropical 
rains and an unexpected increase in the prison population prevented 
them from meeting their own deadlines for easing overcrowding 
they said they inherited the problem from a previous 
administration and had more than tripled the commonwealths prison 
budget prison capacity was increased from 5400 in 1985 to 10295 
last year they said 
but the 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld the fines in 
september 
the relevant harm confinement in an area smaller than 5by7 
feet is significant the appeals court said the number of 
prisoners suffering that harm 7 to 10 percent is large and the 
time since entry of the remedial decree is long

the state labor commissioner known for 
his bib overalls and frugality is running for a second term 
against a field of unknowns his critics say hes incompetent 
im alive and ready to go punching said byron knutson 60 
a democrat whose eccentricities and penchant for beating 
partyendorsed candidates in primary elections have won him a 
reputation as a political maverick 
knutson dismissing his critics as politically motivated and lt 
gov lloyd omdahl as a snothead and meddling nincompoop 
says hell be in office when his enemies are pushing up daisies 
from their political graves 
he certainly is better known than his seven declared opponents 
who include a retired navy man a diesel mechanic a 24yearold 
rancher and two state senators one of whom once introduced 
legislation to abolish the labor job 
the only declared democratic candidate a former labor union 
official pleaded guilty to drunken driving days after his 
announcement 
it would be tough to pick out a good candidate in the 
field the grand forks herald said in an editorial still the 
incompetent incumbent makes the seven other candidates attractive 
in comparison 
knutsons office handles wage claims discrimination 
allegations firing disputes and other jobrelated matters his 
office has seven workers including knutson whose annual salary is 
49300 
tales of knutsons quirks and frugality have bolstered his 
popularity 
he occasionally shows up for work in striped bib overalls during 
north dakotas freezing winters he attended his 1976 inauguration 
as insurance commissioner in a suit he bought at a thrift store for 
35 cents 
i was in school at the time you have to adjust expenditures 
to income he said they just happened to have something that 
fit me 
his critics including democrats gov george sinner and attorney 
general nicholas spaeth want knutson to resign but he has ignored 
them 
the labor departments average time for handling a wage claim 
has doubled since knutson took office and his backlog of cases has 
ballooned says state auditor gordy smith 
knutson who often works nights on cases with help from his 
wife bernice says his own audits show his backlog is considerably 
less than state auditors say 
omdahl saying he has never seen such a mess in state 
government in my life concedes state officials are powerless 
over knutson who is independently elected 
the dispute over his management led to a recent confrontation 
with omdahl who heads a legislative oversight committee that is 
looking into the labor department 
knutson bumped omdahl as the lieutenant governor tried to leave 
during a recess and later referred to omdahl as a snothead and 
a meddling nincompoop mrs knutson poked the lieutenant 
governor in the chest as she protested his opinion of her husband 
i need a manager omdahl joked later and an editorial 
cartoon pictured knutson in a boxing robe 
give and take is part of the way the public business is 
conducted knutson said sometimes its more refined than other 
ways 
a former state legislator knutson served four years as state 
insurance commissioner and ran unsuccessfully for secretary of 
state and the public service commission before winning the labor 
office from a republican in 1986 
in three of his six statewide races knutson defeated the 
democrats endorsed candidate in the primary 
knutson is a gregarious campaigner with a ready handshake and 
knack for remembering names and his norwegian surname helps in a 
state where 15 percent of the population has norwegian ancestry 
sinner says voters in the june 12 primary will have to judge the 
situation and knutson says hes perfectly content to let them 
im not going to take anything for granted and say its a 
cinch knutson said we work as if we need every last contact 
i like to be out amidst it i need to have a certain amount of the 
chin sticking out

a dispute between the soviet union and the 
united states over the use of xray equipment to inspect soviet 
missile canisters is close to being resolved the state department 
said monday 
productive talks have been held between us and soviet 
technical teams about the use of the cargoscan inspection system to 
probe canisters emerging from the soviet missile plant at votkinsk 
the department said 
asked if soviet objections to the use of the system are on the 
way to being settled department spokesman richard boucher replied 
i think thats fair 
but i dont want to say its over boucher added noting 
that talks are continuing 
american inspectors at the votkinsk facility about 700 miles 
east of moscow filed an unprecedented complaint last week after 
the soviets objected to the use of cargospan to verify the contents 
of at least three missile canisters 
the objective is to make sure canisters leaving the plant dont 
contain mediumrange missiles banned under the 1987 ussoviet 
intermediate nuclear forces or inf treaty 
secretary of state james a baker iii lodged an official protest 
over the incident with his counterpart soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze and technical teams were dispatched to 
votkinsk to attempt to thresh out the matter 
cargospan is a key element in verifying soviet compliance with 
the terms of the inf treaty and some us officials fear that 
continued soviet objections to its use could give a new weapon to 
armscontrol critics on capitol hill who see the incident as proof 
that such treaties are not adequately verifiable 
they also are concerned about the potential adverse impact on 
negotiations in geneva aimed at sharply reducing the numbers of 
longrange intercontinental missiles 
other officials argue that chances for successfully negotiating 
a strategic arms reduction or start treaty are enhanced when the 
united states recognizes in advance the technical issues that can 
arise after a treaty has been signed 
they note that the bush administration has emphasized in start 
and other armscontrol negotiations experiments and measures to 
test the technical means of verification before a treaty is signed 
an array of verification measures proposed by the united states 
has been under discussion at the start talks since july

an irancontra prosecutor today inadvertently 
brought out john poindexters immunized congressional testimony 
about destroying a politically embarrassing presidential document 
with rep lee hamilton on the witness stand prosecutor dan webb 
asked whether poindexter ever reported destroying the document 
called a finding 
he did hamilton said in front of the jury the congressman 
was referring to poindexters july 1987 testimony in which the 
former national security adviser admitted tearing up the document 
no part of a prosecutors case may be derived from a defendants 
immunized testimony 
as soon as hamilton answered another prosecutor howard pearl 
stood up webb quickly said i see the problem 
webb rephrased the question but poindexter lawyer richard 
beckler said that i will made an argument on this indicating 
that the defense may move for a mistrial 
hamilton also testified that he had no indication the national 
security council was lying to him in 1985 when it denied assisting 
the contras 
hamilton who was chairman of the house intelligence committee 
in 1985 and 1986 testified for the prosecution as it began 
wrapping up its case against poindexter onetime national security 
adviser to president reagan 
poindexter is accused of covering up oliver norths military 
assistance to the contras and the us role in a november 1985 
shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
hamilton told the court today that congress approved the boland 
amendment cutting off us military aid to the contras in order to 
stop the war in nicaragua 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb told hamilton that oliver 
north has testified that written answers denying the nsc was 
assisting the contras were all false 
did hamilton have any idea the answers were false asked webb 
i had no such indications said the indiana democrat 
poindexter embraced the denials in 1986 as congress continued to 
inquire into whether the nsc was assisting the contras 
also scheduled to testify for the prosecution was eric newsome 
a former senate intelligence committee staffer who attended a 
meeting on the hawk missiles with poindexter 
the heart of the governments case is norths testimony given 
reluctantly against his former boss 
the former white house aide testified that he didnt want to 
meet with hamilton then chairman of the house intelligence 
committee to discuss whether north was giving military assistance 
to the contras 
north told poindexter he might be asked questions about matters 
which he was supposed to keep secret 
poindexter sent him to the meeting anyway telling him you can 
handle it or you can take care of it north testified 
north lied at the meeting saying he hadnt met with contra 
supporter john singlaub for 20 months had only casual contact with 
contra liaison robert owen and wasnt giving military advice to the 
rebels 
hamilton also attended the nov 21 1986 meeting with 
poindexter who told the intelligence committee he didnt learn of 
the hawks shipment until january 1986 poindexter made a similar 
statement the same day to the senate intelligence committee 
the prosecution says poindexters motive for concealing the us 
role in the shipment was the existence of a politically 
embarrassing presidential finding that depicted the hawks shipment 
as a straight armsforhostages deal poindexter tore up the 
finding the same day he testified before the committees 
north testified that he watched poindexter destroy the finding 
in the national security advisers office 
poindexters lawyers begin presenting their case next and are 
expected to replay former president reagans videotaped testimony 
the former president made a number of comments favorable to 
poindexter including a suggestion that it might have been 
acceptable to destroy documents in the affair to protect national 
security

a woman was sentenced monday to 15 
yearstolife in prison for the starvation death of her 2monthold 
daughter 
tonnette rae lee 29 and her husband james lowell lee 38 
were convicted of seconddegree murder after an autopsy revealed 
that the baby janelle had no food in her system when she died 
dec 8 1988 
judge roger randall delayed sentencing of lee until april 16 
deputy district attorney terry p pelton said the infants 
weight fell from 5 pounds 6 ounces at birth on oct 1 1988 to 3 
pounds 5 ounces when she died nine weeks later 
it was an extreme case of malnutrition pelton said 
the defense argued that although a forensic pathologist 
testified that the baby died of malnutrition he could not be sure 
whether something else contributed to the death such as digestive 
problems or a birth defect 
mrs lee said the couple could not afford to take the baby to a 
doctor the couples two sons are under protective custody of kern 
county officials

the soviet government today issued a harsh warning 
that it would not allow lithuania to put up its own customs posts 
introduce its own currency or take over moscowrun factories 
without permission 
the warning represented the first concrete steps taken by the 
government to counter lithuanias march 13 declaration of 
independence which president mikhail s gorbachev has called 
invalid however the warning did not specify what measures the 
kremlin would take to protect its interests 
the government announcement read on soviet tv accused 
lithuanian leaders of planning to turn over national factories to 
private owners bring in a separate currency and put up customs 
posts on the soviet border 
the government was especially concerned about nuclear power 
plants in the baltic republic it said 
the announcement came as a delegation of lithuanian legislators 
arrived in moscow seeking talks with gorbachev on their declaration 
of independence 
in the lithuanian capital of vilnius president vytautus 
landsbergis said soviet military maneuvers in lithuania were 
increasing tensions in the region 
on sunday soviet military jets buzzed vilnius in what many 
lithuanians considered an intimidation tactic and soviet troops 
held maneuvers in the countryside 
the military exercises of soviet troops in lithuania now 
underway are intensifying tensions landsbergis told lithuanias 
legislature according to lithuanian television editor eduardas 
potashinkis who monitored the meeting 
the lithuanian leader said he was told in a meeting with 
highranking soviet officers on sunday that the maneuvers had been 
planned long in advance 
landsbergis asked if he would be notified in advance of future 
maneuvers and one of the officers replied that he could not make 
any guarantees 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said he was told 
by the defense ministry that no major military maneuvers are 
under way in lithuania the armed forces are acting in accordance 
with training plans 
the sixmember delegation that arrived in moscow was headed by 
egidius bickauskas a lawyer who recently resigned from the 
lithuanian communist party 
it was empowered by lithuanias parliament to meet with 
gorbachev and propose a start of negotiations on independence said 
a spokesman for the lithuanian nationalist movement sajudis 
the soviet congress of peoples deputies on thursday declared 
lithuanias feb 11 declaration of independence illegal and 
directed gorbachev to defend soviet interests and citizens in the 
baltic republic of 38 million 
on friday the soviet leader sent a cable to landsbergis giving 
him three days to respond to the decree 
however gorbachev struck a conciliatory tone sunday saying he 
still planned to talk with lithuanians about returning to the 
soviet fold he said no ultimatums had been issued and that he also 
wanted negotiations on the question of independence 
i think we shall receive a reply from the authorities of 
presentday lithuania and depending on what it is everything will 
become clear the character and content of the answer will define 
our next steps he said 
gorbachev said earlier this month that before allowing 
independence he would demand 34 billion in hard currency money 
lithuania would be hardpressed to obtain in compensation for 
soviet investments in the republic 
if it wishes to exert economic pressure the kremlin also has 
the option of cutting off supplies of cheap energy and raw 
materials 
landsbergis drafted a reply to gorbachevs message over the 
weekend and a sajudis spokesman andreas ajubalis said it declared 
that lithuanias parliament has the mandate to enter negotiations 
with the ussr government 
the main thing now is to reach an agreement in principle in 
starting the negotiating process he said 
bickauskas who is also a deputy in the national supreme soviet 
said at todays kremlin session that the situation in the republic 
was normal and the lithuanian government is in control 
he said the lithuanian legislature on saturday confirmed its 
decision to declare independence and urged the soviet union to 
solve the issue through interstate talks 
lithuania along with the other baltic republics of latvia and 
estonia was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
gorbachev speaking to reporters after voting in local runoff 
elections in moscow on monday continued to insist the lithuanian 
break was illegal and must be decided by the entire soviet union 
he said economic political cultural and technical ties were 
too strong to tear apart and human contacts have become 
particularly deep so it is a futile attempt to destroy them he 
expressed concern for lithuanias ethnic minorities mainly 
russians and poles 
nikolai medvedev a member of the lithuanian delegation and a 
deputy in the national congress said in an interview at the 
congress today that they hoped to meet with gorbachev today but no 
appointment had been set 
we are here and waiting to be called he said we will 
stay here as long as it takes 
he said he did not expect an immediate start to negotiations 
there will be some delay as the issues are contemplated then 
negotiations will start at the official level and eventually 
actual negotiations 
on saturday landsbergis appealed to democratic nations for 
official recognition of his new government so far no country has 
recognized lithuanian independence

in a crumbling navajo hogan on a rise 
dotted with pinon and juniper colorful wall paintings of kiowa 
rituals and hopi kachina figures are washing into the red dirt 
rain and snow fall through what once was a conical roof eating 
away the indian murals a brave raises his arms toward a buffalo 
another beats a drum dancers chant and hold prayer wands a 
funeral procession makes its way 
vanishing with them is part of the history of naturalist ernest 
thompson seton who founded the woodcraft indians organization at 
the turn of the century championed indians when many saw them as 
red devils and who built the navajo hogan as part of his college 
of indian wisdom in the 1930s 
the britishborn canadianraised seton was 70 in 1930 when he 
bought 2500 acres of land near santa fe to build seton village an 
artist colony and cultural center 
a national historic landmark since 1966 seton village includes 
the 30room stone seton castle a kiva or ceremonial chamber 
decorated with the plumed serpent of the san ildefonso indian 
pueblo and the circular navajo hogan with the damaged murals 
it was painted by a kiowa indian named jack hokeah who was at 
the indian school in santa fe said dee seton barber setons 
daughter the hogan was for public ceremonies a campfire and 
stories a dance demonstration or whatever a woodcraft council 
mrs barber who still lives in seton castle said she had the 
hogan reroofed 18 years ago but cant afford to do it again 
time weather and vandals have nearly destroyed it 
seton built his rambling mansion after a lifetime as an author 
illustrator naturalist and lecturer it was designed to house his 
library of 40000 books nearly 3000 paintings and drawings and 
3000 bird and animal skins 
he wrote hundreds of books and articles including wild 
animals i have known two little savages and the first boy 
scout manual 
he hobnobbed with teddy roosevelt and mark twain helped found 
the american boy scouts and was named their first chief scout but 
he fell out with roosevelt and scouting leaders because he believed 
the movement had turned too militaristic in world war i 
he urged the government to give back indian hunting grounds 
helped southwestern indians support themselves through 
traditionbased pottery textiles and jewelry rather than cheap 
tourist knickknacks and brought indians to seton village to share 
their traditions songs stories and art 
he adopted his daughter in 1938 when he was 78 
at its height the village had a zoo a museum a craft shop 
dining hall log cabins and adobe houses up to 150 people could 
gather youngsters studying indian lore seton lecturing to adults 
on the virtues of outdoor life his wife julia beating a drum and 
singing an evening chant at lights out 
snapshots taken in the 1930s and 1940s show intricate wood 
carvings over entrances to dorms and the dining hall long rows of 
tepees a thriving vegetable garden 
many adobe houses remain some rebuilt and expanded other 
buildings including the dining hall dorms and dance lodge are 
gone and the hogan nearly so 
the national park service oversees national historic landmarks 
but has no repair money for them it reported in 1986 that the 
outside of the hogan could be patched for 6000 it also 
recommended spending 2800 to have an art conservator evaluate the 
paintings inside before restoring them 
the kiva with the plumed serpent painting circling its inner 
wall at that time needed 5450 in exterior work plus interior 
repairs evaluation and outside grading costing an estimated 2300 
those findings were made in a landmarks at risk report 
soliciting donations to the national park foundation which 
administers private contributions for the park service 
but we were unsuccessful with seton village said gregory d 
kendrick chief of the history unit at the park services rocky 
mountain regional office 
now the weather and vandal damage to the hogan is far more 
severe and its unclear whether any of the murals can be saved 
i dont even go out there anymore said mrs barber it 
just makes me sick

are you a husky squarefaced texan born 
and bred if you have a yellowish coat white stocking feet and a 
white polecat streak down your back the heifers of the lbj ranch 
are looking for a handsome texas hereford bull like you 
the national park service is searching for an especially 
handsome bull to maintain the cattle bloodlines on this ranch that 
was the pride of president johnson 
at lbjs request the ranch was given to the government in 1973 
so that visitors could see what the ranch was like when he was 
chief executive 
despite the us beef industrys drive to produce taller leaner 
cattle the ranch wants to maintain a squatty short herd of 
herefords descended from those that roamed the pedernales 
pastureland in lbjs time 
in those days said buddy hodges chief of ranching the 
preferred hereford build was shortlegged dumpy and plump 
ranch foreman edward meier who began working here when lbj was 
president said johnson didnt want his home to become a relic of 
the past however meier said rebuilding ranch houses to make them 
historically accurate would be easier than breeding cows in a fight 
against advancing genetics 
every three years a new bull must be introduced to avoid 
inbreeding but brings the risk of producing a herd that looks a 
little less like the one lbj admired 
texas aampm university has been assisting the ranch in plans to 
preserve its genetic pool meier said 
the historically accurate breeders are attended to daily and 
are admired by thousands who snap their pictures and applaud the 
antics of their offspring at present 23 babies cling to their 
mamas along the winding route of the tourist tram the visitors 
get all excited said meier you gotta admit they are pretty 
little buggers

you might as well call scarlett ohara a yankee 
as call a soviet georgian a russian and dont please circle your 
thumb and forefinger to tell a soviet georgian that its ok with 
you 
those were among the tips for 300 us georgians who are 
participating in the friendship forces largest single exchange of 
citizens between the united states and the soviet union a 
georgiatogeorgia exchange april 17 to may 1 
the us participants in their first meeting sunday at clark 
atlanta university learned that its the little things that count 
for example the circled thumb and forefinger gesture which 
means ok to a us georgian is an obscene gesture in the 
soviet republic where atlantas sister city tbilisi is the 
capital 
women in slacks are frowned upon 
the group also was told to expect much more hospitality from 
their hosts than they are used to especially in drinking and 
making toasts if they admire someones painting or jewelry it may 
be given to them on the spot 
friendship force officials reassured the group that the 
political situation seems to be stable in soviet georgia which is 
one of several republics agitating for independence 
among noted us georgians participating are rosalynn carters 
mother allie smith atlanta mayor maynard jacksons daughter 
valerie amanda jackson and atlanta entertainers liz spraggins and

sewage dumped at sea poses a significant health 
risk to seafood lovers and swimmers who can pick up bacteria and 
viruses said an international report on the worlds oceans 
released monday 
the contaminated sewage can cause hepatitis cholera polio 
gastrointestinal illnesses and possibly aids it said 
contrary to public fears however radioactive contamination of 
the oceans remains extremely low and the oceans are not 
threatened by oil pollution except at the sites of major spills 
the report said 
the united nationssponsored report said coastal waters are the 
most vulnerable and abused they are threatened by contaminated 
sewage runaway coastal development and excess nutrients such as 
phosphates and nitrates which are killing fish and altering plant 
life 
professor alasdair mcintyre of the university of aberdeen in 
scotland chairman of the 20member panel that prepared the report 
rejected the theory that sunlight and waves quickly destroy 
dangerous organisms in sewage 
it used to be thought that a very short time in the sea killed 
off these organisms but we are having to recognize this is not the 
case he told a news conference 
the report said eating contaminated seafood is firmly linked 
with serious illness including viral hepatitis and cholera and 
that bathing in contaminated water could also cause illness 
there are records of people contracting polio from swimming in 
contaminated water mcintyre said he said a us study showed 
the polio virus could survive for 17 months in sewagepolluted 
marine waters 
epidemiological studies in the united states and the 
mediterranean have also provided unequivocal evidence that 
swimmers in sea water polluted with microorganisms from feces have 
a higher incidence of gastric disorders the report said 
the fact that viruses are known to survive for surprisingly 
long periods is a significant development he said 
asked about the aids virus mcintyre said although the chance 
of an aids virus surviving would be very slight nevertheless it 
could survive 
last week patrick gowen a british marine biologist formerly at 
the university of east anglia told a parliamentary committee that 
new research showed the aids virus could live for more than 24 
hours in sea water he warned that swimmers could catch it through 
cuts sunburn sores and shingle scuffs 
the world health organization dismissed the claim as total 
nonsense 
the report by the group of experts on the scientific aspects of 
marine pollution said human pollution was evident in the oceans 
from the poles to the tropics and from beaches to abyssal 
depths 
the scientists said the open sea is still relatively clean 
but marine habitats and resources along the oceans coasts were 
being damaged irretrievably by harbor developments industrial 
installations tourist facilities and saltwater fish farming 
although difficult to quantify destruction of beaches coral 
reefs and wetlands including mangrove forests as well as 
increasing erosion of the shore are evident all over the world 
the report said 
the increasing flow of nitrates and phosphates to coastal 
waters mainly from sewage disposal and agricultural runoff has 
resulted in excessive plant growth which is choking some coastal 
waters and killing fish the report said 
without immediate international action mcintyre said there 
is good reason to fear a significant deterioration in the marine 
environment in the next decade 
the report said nuclear installations fallout from 
weaponstesting and more recently from the accident at chernobyl 
in the soviet union have added to radioactivity levels naturally 
occurring in sea water 
but it said the levels remain extremely low and these 
additions have had insignificant effects on man and other 
organisms

the former socialist mayor of burlington 
on monday announced a new bid for congress and pledged not to 
soften his rhetoric 
i am what i am and what i have been for 20 years bernard 
sanders told reporters 
sanders an independent hoping to improve his strong 
secondplace showing in the 1988 house race said he decided to run 
again for congress rather than governor because of concern about 
national and international issues 
i can honestly say that there is no race that i have ever run 
in which i feel more enthusiastic more confident and which has 
for me a greater sense of urgency said sanders who stepped 
down in april after running vermonts largest city for eight years 
the 1988 race was won by republican peter smith with 41 percent 
of the vote sanders drew 38 percent twice that for democratic 
nominee paul poirier 
sanders said he considers himself a socialist but will again 
run as an independent in the november election analysts say the 
democrats might not field a candidate giving sanders a headon 
contest against smith 
if elected sanders said he would strive to create a national 
health care system shift the burden of taxes away from workers and 
the middle classes cut in half defense spending in five years to 
acknowledge radical changes in the soviet bloc and halt the 
destruction of the environment 
politically we need the courage to put the environment first 
and corporate profits last he said

the white house said monday the victory of 
east german conservatives in sundays elections bolsters the case 
for keeping a united germany in nato 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said the elections were a 
victory not only for the people of east germany but for all 
germans and all who support democratic values 
it does appear the march towards reunification is 
inexorable said the presidential spokesman 
a conservative alliance linked with west german chancellor 
helmut kohls christian democrats won a large plurality on a 
platform favoring rapid unification with west germany 
the united states has insisted that a reunited germany remain in 
the wests military alliance and fitzwater said the balloting 
showed support for the western approach our policy clearly is 
that a reunified germany would be in nato chancellor kohl has 
indicated that he said this victory would seem to lend 
support for that direction as well 
the soviet union wants germany to be neutral and reiterated 
monday that the new germany must not be in nato 
that would upset the balance of europe soviet foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said in moscow 
we respect the expressed will of the citizens of east germany 
an allied sovereign state gerasimov said respecting this 
right of choice we proceed from the premise that in turn they 
will respect the legitimate interests of the soviet union and other 
countries 
fitzwater in a statement said we are pleased to note that 
east germany yesterday joined the growing list of nations that have 
held free and fair elections this is a victory not only for the 
people of the german democratic republic but for all germans and 
all who support democratic values 
we have long supported the aspirations of the people of east 
germany in deciding their own future we join them and the people 
of the federal republic in celebrating this historic occasion 
fitzwater asked about possible obstacles to unification said 
it does appear that the march towards reunification is 
inexorable it seems clear that the elections have sent that 
message 
the united states says nato membership for germany would help 
safeguard the security of both east and west in europe 
bush and kohl met at camp david md feb 1011 to discuss the 
fastmoving changes that could lead to a single germany by the end 
of this year west germans vote in their own federal elections in 
december 
the conservative alliance for germany won 482 percent of the 
vote and 193 of the 400 parliamentary seats in east germans first 
free election since 1933 the communists who had ruled under a 
dictatorship for the past 41 years won just 163 percent of the 
votes and 65 seats 
the new government that forms in the next 30 days will take part 
in unification talks with west germany and the four chief world war 
ii victors britain france the soviet union and the united 
states 
nato is the 16nation western military alliance forged in the 
1950s as a united defense against communist aggression its rival 
warsaw pact has been shaken by the collapse of communist rule in 
most east bloc nations over the past year

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
550000 award won and then lost by a texas couple whose daughter 
was born with deformities after her mother took the antinausea 
drug bendectin 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that overturned a jury award against merrell dow 
pharmaceuticals the drugs manufacturer 
mr and mrs floyd brock of moscow texas sued merrell dow 
after their daughter rachel was born with deformed limbs in 1982 
a threemember panel of the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
last year threw out the 550000 judgment a federal trial jury had 
awarded the brocks 
the appeals court said there is no definitive scientific proof 
that bendectin causes birth defects and said the jury award was 
based on speculation 
speculation unconfirmed by proof cannot form the basis for 
causation in a court of law the appeals court said 
the full 5th circuit court by a 86 vote refused to review the 
threemember panels ruling 
the dissenters noted that six experts testified for the brocks 
that bendectin is capable of causing birth defects and that three 
testified they believed the drug caused rachels deformities 
the dissenting judges said appellate courts should not 
substitute their understanding of the facts for that of a jury 
merely because medical experts disagree 
bendectin was marketed by richardsonmerrell inc between 1957 
and 1983 more than 30 million women used the drug during 
pregnancy richardsonmerrell later became merrell dow which last 
july merged with marion laboratories inc and became marion merrell 
dow inc based in kansas city 
the company stopped selling bendectin 1983 although the federal 
drug administration never has rescinded approval of it 
merrell dow in 1984 agreed to pay 120 million to more than 800 
families to compensate children with birth defects allegedly caused 
by bendectin as part of the settlement the corporation did not 
admit that the drug caused the defects 
the settlement was rejected by a federal appeals court and the 
lawsuits then went to a consolidated trial in ohio where merrell 
dow has its headquarters in hamilton county 
after a 22day trial in 1985 an ohio jury found that bendectin 
did not cause birth defects when taken in prescribed doses 
the case acted on today is brock vs merrell dow 891189

the supreme court today refused to become 
embroiled in a fight between environmentalists and the bush 
administration over oregon timber and the northern spotted owl 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that threw out 
part of a lawsuit seeking to protect the owl from the asserted 
threat posed by logging operations in the old forests of westalership sentenced 
under the law to six months 
in prison 
refused to hear appeals stemming from a 200 million 
settlement of pricefixing charges against the nations leading 
manufacturers of folding cartons 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that 
redistributed a 6 million surplus from the settlement in one of 
the biggest antitrust cases ever 
refused to hear a bush administration appeal aimed at making 
it costlier for an organization called the national security 
archive to compile information 
the archive is a nonprofit organization that collects 
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it 
available to the public in various ways it has filed thousands of 
foia requests for government records 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that gives the 
archive the same preferential status under the freedom of 
information act that other news media enjoy 
the us fish and wildlife service estimates that about 1500 
breeding pairs of northern spotted owls remain and that without 
protection their numbers could be cut in half by the year 2050 
the owl is being considered for inclusion on the federal 
governments endangered species list 
a coalition of environmental groups including the various 
audubon society chapters the wilderness society the sierra club 
and the natural resources defense council sued the interior 
department in 1987 over timbermanagement plans for the western 
oregon forests 
the lawsuit alleged that the departments bureau of land 
management had decided to continue logging oldgrowth timber 
without adequately considering the detrimental effects to the 
spotted owl population 
the governments decision therefore was made in violation of

voters in this chicago suburb have a chance 
to play art critics theyre being asked to give the thumbs up or 
thumbs down to a 50foottall stainlesssteel shish kebab of eight 
automobiles 
a special referendum on tuesdays ballot asks voters to decide 
whether the massive 100000 artistic construction titled 
spindle and one known as bilbored should be removed from 
its display in a shopping plaza 
the plazas owner david bermant says hes placed similar works 
in the 20 shopping plazas he owns around the country without any 
of the fuss spindle and bilbored raised in berwyn 
bermant who splits his time between the east and west coasts 
acknowledges having been warned that his tastes in art might clash 
with those of the conservative middleclass suburb but he 
nonetheless professes astonishment at the criticism 
ive just about had it with berwyn he said i mean im 
really discouraged about berwyn dont they have any sense of 
aesthetics in berwyn 
if they do it apparently was offended by spindle erected 
last year and the 9yearold bilbored an equally massive 
assemblage of household goods appliances and concrete 
bilbored looks like a big pork chop filled with garbage 
and spindle is just more junk up our gazoos state republican 
sen judy baar topinka said at a recent hearing 
despite such caustic reviews local officials lamented that 
their options were limited 
there is no law covering it said lawrence zdarsky berwyns 
administrative coordinator building ordinances simply do not 
forsee eight autos being piled on top of one another 
what do you do ticket them 
bermant and berwyn officials eventually negotiated a solution 
an advisory referendum along with some private polling by bermant 
to determine just what residents think of the citys most prominent 
works of art 
bermant cried foul after the ballots were printed because they 
solicit a yes or no on the future of spindle as well as 
bilbored though the tower of skewered automobiles has been in 
place for only a few months he also said he thought the vote would 
come next fall not this spring 
you need 10 years to gain an understanding of art like this 
he protested 
but if the vote and my polls show the worst that they really 
hate it then thats that ive had it ill rip all the art out 
and sell the whole damned shopping center he said 
its really quite saleable you know

united press international will ask an appeals 
court on tuesday to stop reuters from backing out of a picture 
exchange agreement between the two news services 
upi is seeking an injunction that was denied last week by us 
district judge peter k leisure who ruled that upi would not be 
irreparably harmed if the contract were discontinued 
reuters had been ordered to continue the exchange until 5 pm 
monday however it said it would keep supplying upi with pictures 
from overseas until tuesdays hearing before the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals 
the injunction request stems from a upi counterclaim to a 
reuters federal lawsuit that seeks to void the picture exchange 
reuters says the agreement was not living up to expectations 
the contract was entered into in 1984 it called for upi to 
supply reuters with pictures from the united states while reuters 
provided upi with pictures from other countries it was to run for 
10 years beginning in 1985 
upi says it will lose clients if reuters ends the agreement

president bush claimed progress monday in the 
war on drugs and asked a group of state attorneys general for 
suggestions on how to do better some suggested he send more money 
bush agreed there was a need for additional federal support but 
blamed congress for dragging its feet on his anticrime and 
antidrug efforts 
weve gotten some of what weve asked for new agents new 
prosecutors new prison space but i must confess to a certain 
frustration he said 
he told the national association of attorneys general that 
recognition was important that this problem is national and that 
nobodys going to make it by dealing just at the federal level 
i would ask your support this much horsepower in town to 
work with us on getting this crime package through bush 
said speaking to attorneys general from 37 states 
bush said he sensed a certain turning around at least in 
terms of public opinion on the issue of drugs mentioning that 
antidrug messages are being worked into some saturday morning 
cartoon shows 
twenty million kids watch cartoons every saturday bush 
said now that couldnt have happened if it hadnt been for the 
focus that you all are putting on the drug problem 
some of the attorneys general made a plea for more federal funds 
pennsylvania attorney general ernest d preate jr told 
reporters that the money earmarked to help the states was not 
enough 
you cant fight a war against drugs unless you have the kind 
of financial commitment thats necessary to put troops into the 
field preate said 
but national drug policy director william j bennett argued that 
if congress accepts the administrations proposal for spending 
106 billion on the drug effort in fiscal 1991 it will represent a 
70 percent increase in funds over the 1989 level of 6 billion 
no other federal program has seen that kind of increase 
bennett said thats real money and its going to make a 
difference 
i dont object to people coming here and saying they need 
more bennett added theyre going to get more well be back 
in future years for more but lets not ignore whats been done 
whats been done is significant and substantial 
for one thing bennett said there was a lot more drugs coming 
into this country than previously thought 
tom miller attorney general of iowa and president of the 
national association of attorneys general said bennett had 
arranged to meet with state officials on the drug problem at a june 
conference in washington

robert h bork who once hoped for a supreme 
court seat instead stood before the nations highest court monday 
he was there in the capacity of a lawyer apparently making him 
the first defeated supreme court nominee ever to argue before the 
justices 
representing citibank in a bigstakes battle bork argued that 
us banks with branch offices overseas should not be required to 
pay depositors after foreign governments seize or freeze those 
accounts 
the senate rejected borks nomination to the high court in 1987 
after a bitter political battle he was branded a conservative 
extremist by opponents 
bork nominated by thenpresident reagan has said he was the 
victim of a campaign of lies and distortions led by liberals 
there were no references to that fight monday as bork engaged in 
debate with the justices and opposing lawyers over the complexities 
of federal banking law and related matters 
bork was treated much the same as any attorney who appears 
before the justices they questioned him vigorously occasionally 
interrupting him for clarification and elaboration 
justice anthony m kennedy who occupies the seat that eluded 
bork directed a few questions at bork 
bork 63 a former federal appeals court judge is a fellow at 
the american enterprise institute and will begin teaching 
constitutional law in the fall at the george mason university law 
school in arlington va 
he will be paid 25000 a year to teach one course each semester 
as a parttime professor 
bork was only the sixth man this century to be denied a supreme 
court seat by the senate and the 26th in its history

the victorious alliance for germany said 
monday the german states must move more quickly to reunify but its 
leader was rebuffed as he began trying to form a coalition 
government to move the process along 
a more leftleaning party the social democrats turned down an 
invitation to join the coalition thus blocking the alliance from 
having a twothirds majority in parliment such a majority would 
allow east germany to simply declare a merger with the west 
the threeparty alliance swept to victory sunday in east 
germanys first free elections but did not win a majority in the 
400seat parliament 
the alliance got a boost monday from perhaps its biggest 
supporter west german chancellor helmut kohl who promised 
financial aid for east germany 
the chancellor had refused such aid to the communists who have 
governed since hardliner erich honecker was overthrown in the fall 
lothar de maiziere likely to be the next east german premier 
invited the social democrats and the union of free democrats to 
discuss forming a grand coalition to guide the nation toward 
unification with the broadest possible consensus 
he clearly was disappointed when social democratic leader 
ibrahim boehme refused 
mr boehme must certainly have to ask himself what he meant in 
the last few weeks when he repeatedly said our countrys problems 
are so big they must be carried on the broadest possible 
shoulders de maiziere said 
however an alliance of centrist liberal parties which won 21 
seats was ready to negotiate joining in a coalition with the 
alliance west germanys ard television said that would give a de 
maiziereled government 214 seats in parliament 
de maizieres christian democratic union is one of three parties 
comprising the alliance the party stresses traditional christian 
values and less government control of the economy and 
traditionally has been at odds with the social democrats who 
follow a leftist socialistoriented path 
the social democrats said moving quickly to reunify could result 
in a loss of east germanys cradletograve social services and 
allow the country to be swallowed up by its wealthy neighbor 
the party placed second in the vote with 218 percent and 87 
seats in parliament the alliance won 482 percent and 193 seats 
the party of democratic socialism the former communist party 
placed third with 163 percent it will have 12 seats in parliament 
de maiziere held a round of meetings monday with the goals of 
forming a government and uniting with the west 
here we will carry forward and step up the pace of the 
already started negotiations he said 
he urged rapid introduction of a monetary economic and social 
union with west germany in a largely symbolic move he said the 
berlin wall should be torn down as soon as possible as a clear 
sign of the merging of the two german states 
the wall was opened nov 9 during the height of the 
prodemocracy movement that made sundays vote possible large 
pieces of it already have come down 
the balloting marked the first free elections in east german 
history and capped the countrys transition to democracy after four 
decades of ironfisted communist rule 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the vote was a 
victory not only for the people of east germany but for all 
germans and all who support democratic values 
it does appear the march toward reunification is inexorable 
he said 
the new government will take part in unification talks with west 
germany and the four world war ii allies britain france the 
soviet union and the united states a major obstacle is the 
military alignment of a unified germany 
the western powers want germany to be part of nato the soviets 
and east german communists have called for a neutral single state 
both sides made clear monday they have not changed their attitudes 
our policy clearly is that a reunified germany would be in 
nato chancellor kohl has indicated that this victory would 
seem to lend support for that direction as well fitzwater said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
putting the new germany in nato would upset the military balance of 
europe 
we respect the expressed will of the citizens of east germany 
an allied sovereign state gerasimov said respecting this 
right of choice we proceed from the premise that in turn they 
will respect the legitimate interests of the soviet union and other 
countries 
kohls government is scheduled to decide tuesday on ways to halt 
the immigration of east germans to his country the exodus sparked 
the fall revolution and has come to strain west germanys social 
services while crippling the easts economy 
at a news conference in bonn kohl said he stands behind his 
promises of a financial bailout now that a democratically elected 
government is about to take over he did not give specifics

mother had always said she prayed every day for her son and his 
students so if some of you made it its because of her

laborers hurried to finish platforms 
and bleachers monday as foreign dignitaries began arriving for the 
celebrations to mark namibias passage from being africas last 
colony to its youngest nation 
about 5000 foreign visitors mostly diplomats and journalists 
are expected to join tens of thousands of namibians to watch the 
south african flag lowered in favor of namibias red green and 
blue banner 
the event which begins tuesday and continues into wednesday 
will end 75 years of south african rule south africa captured the 
former german colony during world war i and for decades imposed the 
same apartheid laws that separate blacks and whites in south africa 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will be 
present at namibias birth along with south african president fw 
de klerk south african blac leader nelson mandela at least 10 
african heads of state soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and us secretary of state james a baker iii 
on his arrival de cuellar said namibian independence was a 
major achievement for the united nations the world now speaks of 
the namibian model in praise of the determination restraint 
tolerance and political maturity of the namibian people he said 
at the airport 
baker made no comment on arriving at the airport and he and his 
party were whisked away in a convoy of cars 
wednesdays independence date was selected to mark the 30th 
anniversary of the sharpeville massacre when 69 unarmed 
demonstrators were shot to death in south africa while protesting 
apartheid laws in a black township south of johannesburg 
march 21 1960 is a day that people rose up against 
apartheid said hifikepunye pohamba who will become the home 
affairs minister in the new government the day was chosen as a 
sign of solidarity not only for the people of namibia but also 
with the people of south africa 
pohamba is a member of the southwest africa peoples 
organization the group that waged a 23year war against south 
african rule and captured 57 percent of the vote in novembers 
elections swapos longtime leader sam nujoma will become 
namibias first president 
south africa agreed in december 1988 to grant independence to 
namibia under a regional peace treaty that also calls for cuba to 
witldraw its 50000 soldiers from marxistruled angoa by mid1991 
namibia for many years had the same laws of racial segregation 
as south africa although most were scrapped in recent years and 
the huge arid territory of 13 million people has a more relaxed 
atmosphere than south africa 
pohamba said the new government intends to remove symbols of 
colonial brutality such as the old police uniforms 
we feel it an urgent necessity that all old uniforms be taken 
off and all new uniforms be put on pohamba said 
however he said the new outfits for police and prison guards 
were not ready yet circumstances beyond our control he said 
without elaborating 
laborers at several sites rushed to finish platforms and 
bleachers and foreign dignitaries began arriving for the 
celebrations 
windhoek namibias modern capital and largest city with 120000 
residents has only a few hotels and is able to accommodate only a 
fraction of the visitors private homes apartments and railway 
sleeper cars all have been rented out although some visitors were 
still searching for places to stay 
the windhoek airport which usually handles about six flights a 
day must cope with some 200 planes tuesday and wednesday because 
of a lack of space the planes of visiting leaders have to be 
parked in the neighboring countries of south africa botswana 
zimbabwe and zambia 
preparations for independence have gone relatively smoothly so 
far but the new government could face its first political headache 
the day it takes over 
in the dusty central town of rehoboth where virtually all of 
the residents are of mixedrace leaders have refused to relinquish 
the extensive local autonomy granted by south africa under its 
policy of ethnicbased governments 
the new constitution calls for a strong central government and 
does not provide for local authority along racial or ethnic lines 
pohamba said swapo would be willing to negotiate but that 
namibians will not tolerate anyone who wants to dismember the 
territory of namibia 
swapo which was committed to socialism while in exile speaks 
more often of working with the white business community that 
controls the mining farming and fishing industries 
those industries along wih south african aid have made namibia 
one of the few african countries to achieve an annual per capita 
income of 1000 
however the countrys wealth is disproportionately in the hands 
of the 75000 whites who make up only 6 percent of the population 
and south african aid is ending

the bush administration monday sent congress a 
22 billion fiveyear plan for commercial aviation to be funded by 
a new airport tax of up to 12 per roundtrip and 25 percent 
increases in other aviation taxes 
federal aviation administrator james b busey said the 
reauthorization bill would help meet the growing demand for 
aviation allow modernization of the faas air traffic control 
system and increase aviation safety 
overall it would boost federal funding for aviation projects 73 
percent in the next five years compared with the amount available 
during the current fiveyear period 
in addition to the plan for improvements faa expects to spend 
between 22 billion and 24 billion on operations and maintenance 
over the next five years including salaries of air traffic 
controllers faa budget officials said 
the faa reauthorization which covers proposed capital 
expenditures through fiscal 1995 is the first major legislation 
proposed under the national transportation policy unveiled by 
president bush and transportation secretary samuel skinner earlier 
this month 
the transportation policy asks users to pay more of the cost of 
air land and sea transportation systems and would shift some 
taxing responsibilities away from the federal government to state 
and local governments 
the aviation plan calls for increases in some federal aviation 
taxes as well although the administration makes a distinction 
between user fees and taxes bush has promised not to increase 
a federal trust fund which is collected from passenger and 
shipper taxes would pay 85 percent of faa costs compared with 57 
percent now 
the fund would be bolstered by an increase in the passenger 
ticket tax from 8 percent to 10 percent freight way bill fees 
would be increased from 5 percent to 6 percent the tax on aviation 
gasoline would increase from 12 cents to 15 cents and on jet fuel 
from 14 cents to 18 cents 
i believe this administration has put forward a comprehensive 
proposal to deal with aviation in the 1990s busey told a meeting 
of airport officials after the plan was sent to capitol hill 
if approved by congress the plan would allow airport taxes for 
the first time since the early 1970s 
the maximum initial tax would be 3 per departure with 
travelers who make connecting flights paying at no more than one 
additional airport each way the legislation would give the 
transportation secretary power to increase the maximum tax after 
fiscal 1991 
after the first year collection of the tax would automatically 
decrease other federal funding available to airports and some 
smaller regional airports might elect not to levy the fee so it 
would not reduce funding under the federal airport improvement 
program said mike moffet an faa assistant administrator 
improvement funds that were freed up as a result of the ticket 
tax each 1 in collections would reduce federal funds available 
to an airport by 50 cents would go into a discretionary fund to 
help airports that need additional money moffet said 
if the nations largest 45 airports impose the ticket tax 
collections are expected to total 1 billion a year he said 
adding that the collections could be used to obtain bonds for about 
10 billion in airport projects over the five years 
federal funding for airport improvements would total 77 
billion over five years a 28 percent increase over amounts made 
available during the past five years 
other funds under the reauthorization program would include 
135 billion for facilities and equipment programs a 130 percent 
increase over the previous five years and 970 million for 
research and development a 13 percent increase 
the administration proposes to fund the programs primarily from 
the trust fund which is expected to have a 76 billion balance by 
the end of fiscal 1990 on sept 30 
the spending plan would decrease funds in the aviation trust 
fund to about 3 billion by the end of the fiveyear period 
officials said 
officials in the aviation industry and some members of congress 
have criticized the build up of money in the trust fund which they 
say has been used to offset the federal deficit

interest rates have peaked and should start 
falling during the spring a group of private economists predicted 
monday 
members of the shadow open market committee said they believed a 
variety of consumer and business loans would decline in coming 
months reflecting a sluggish economy and declining inflationary 
pressures 
the economists forecast that banks prime lending rate the 
benchmark for many business and consumer loans should drop from 10 
percent to 95 percent or perhaps as low as 9 percent by summer 
fixedrate mortgages which are about 1025 percent will fall 
to 98 percent by midyear and remain below 10 percent for the rest 
of 1990 the outlook predicted 
jerry jordan senior economist at first interstate bancorp of 
los angeles who compiled the groups forecast said that weakness 
in the economy would encourage the federal reserve to loosen its 
grip on credit in coming months 
the panel forecast that the federal funds rate a bellwether 
interest rate for judging the impact of fed actions will dip from 
825 percent down to 75 percent by midyear 
various business and consumer rates have been rising since the 
first of the year with the governments 30year bond jumping from 
an average of 79 percent in november and december to around 85 
percent currently 
those rates should fall back to 8 percent the economists 
forecast and remain there through 1991 
the shadow committee was upbeat on the prospects that the 
economy will be able to avoid a recession this year although the 
forecast called for economic growth to remain sluggish reflecting 
previous credittightening on the part of the federal reserve 
inflation which jumped sharply early in the year because of 
severe winter weather will begin moderating with consumer prices 
expected to rise at a slower pace than in 1989 
a soft landing has been achieved jordan said the economy 
is going to muddle through as inflation continues to unwind 
the shadow committee meets twice a year to assess actions of the 
federal reserve whose chief policysetting body the federal open 
market committee will meet next week 
the shadow committee is composed of monetary economists who 
focus on the feds control over the money supply as a determining 
factor in the economys health

chancellor helmut kohl said monday a 
unified european economy should include the soviet bloc and a new 
system for settling potential military conflicts 
kohls comments came at the opening of an eastwest security 
conference that is to focus on the economic recovery of eastern 
european nations that have overthrown their communist regimes in 
the past year 
the conference is the biggest gathering of east and west nations 
since the opening of the berlin wall and it came one day after 
east germans in their first free elections chose a government 
that is likely to embrace kohls plan for a swift reunification of

libya has detained several people suspected of 
setting fire to a chemical plant that us officials said produced 
poison gas libyas ambassador to italy said monday 
ambassador rahman shalgam said the blaze was apparently set by 
a member of the technical staff at the factory the italian 
news agency ansa reported 
he said the person responsible will be executed in the same 
place where the fire took place 
shalgam did not say how many people were detained or give their 
nationalities 
he said the blaze caused damage of great proportions and 
us officials said the plant is inoperable 
but a french company disclosed monday that photographs taken by 
the european satellite spot i show the plant was not destroyed 
the principal structures of the libyan chemical factory at 
rabta dont seem to have been touched and there are no traces on 
the ground of the existence of a fire said christian 
bernard a spokesman for spot image 
except for black traces on the small buildings apparently used 
for storage its like nothing happened at rabta said bernard 
he said the small buildings appear to be 800 yards from the main 
plant the photographs were taken sunday 
the blaze broke out wednesday in the plant in rabta about 60 
miles southwest of tripoli libya said the factory produces 
medicines but the united states and west germany have alleged it 
produces poison gas 
libya has said it suspects that israel the united states and 
west germany were behind the fire all three countries have denied 
involvement 
shalgam said west germany is under suspicion because west german 
firms helped build the plant and would have its techncial plans 
italian news agencies reported 
it was a very dangerous attack which perhaps is part of a 
program of sabotage of which we dont even know the dimensions 
he was quoted as saying 
the blaze occurred shortly after the united states and west 
germany called for the rabta plant to be shut down 
before the fire white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had 
refused to rule out a us military strike to close it

riot police guarded banks and 
supermarkets monday as brazilians began to adjust to radical 
economic reforms that included a new currency and an 18month 
partial freeze on savings accounts 
the measures were announced friday by president fernando collor 
de mello to fight rampant inflation that has soared as high as 
2700 percent 
across the country most banks opened two hours late to adapt to 
the new rules and brazils stock market which also opened late 
reported no transactions during its halfday of trading 
in rio state police in riot gear kept order in the downtown 
financial district as huge lines formed at banks opening for the 
first time since a threeday enforced holiday was declared the 
banks were closed wednesday thursday and friday 
under the vigilance of federal police supermarkets began to 
lower prices to meet government limits prices shot up by as much 
as 200 percent last week in anticipation of a freeze but the new 
economic plan rolled back prices to last mondays levels and set 
maximum prices for 103 staples ranging from beef and eggs to 
matches and toothpaste 
looters attacked five supermarkets in rios poor northern zone 
over the weekend but no violence was reported monday 
brazils radical economic plan was designed to stabilize the 
economy and bring down inflation that reached 2700 percent in the 
past year 
our hope was being taken from us collor de mello said 
sunday night this is our last chance 
collor de mello 40 took office thursday as brazils first 
democratically elected president in 29 years 
the most severe measure was a freeze on bank deposits that 
totaled 115 billion the size of brazils foreign debt the third 
worlds largest 
savers can withdraw the equivalent of 1200 brazilians with 
deposits in the 60 billion short term financial market can take 
out half that amount after paying a tax 
the rest will be frozen for 18 months receiving corrections for 
inflation and 6 percent yearly interest 
the government has confiscated the money of the people after 
promising that it would not alter the rules of the game regarding 
savings accounts said francisco gugael a sao paulo lawyer as 
he stood in line outside a bank collor and his economy minister 
have lost all their credibility 
the new president defended his package and said it wouldnt hurt 
the poor 
in the study we made 90 percent of savings accounts are under 
that limit collor de mello said we had to hit those accounts 
because the big speculators were turning there 
other measures included the elimination of federal subsidies a 
lowering of trade barriers and import restrictions sharp increases 
in taxes and utility rates a floating exchange rate and the 
abolition of 24 state companies and agencies 
on sunday collor de mello said courts wont be allowed to issue 
restraining orders to block the reforms 
opposition parties were to discuss the reforms monday most of 
the measures must be approved by congress with 30 days although 
the president can submit a new 30day decree

a retired army brigadier general and a former 
air force colonel joined with the national organization for women 
on monday in supporting a bill to open army combat jobs to women 
for a fouryear trial period 
if we do have a test within the army i think finally there 
will be documentation to prove that women can perform as 
competently as men in the infantry and other combat areas 
retired brig gen evelyn foote told reporters at a capitol hill 
news conference 
the combat exclusion act approved by congress in 1948 bars 
women in the air force the marines corps and the navy from serving 
in combat positions the army has regulations similar to the law 
women comprise about 11 percent of the total armed forces of 21 
million 
the call for a reexamination of the policy has grown louder 
since army capt linda bray led troops into combat with panamanian 
forces during the us invasion last december 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo and a senior member of the 
house armed services committee proposed legislation in january 
that directs the army to conduct a test study allowing women 
assignment to combat positions 
the legislation faces an uphill fight in congress where many 
members still oppose opening combat jobs to women rep les aspin 
dwis and chairman of the house armed services panel has said the 
measure will not be part of the overall defense bill 
nevertheless officials of now foote and retired col diane 
ordes called for a change in policy starting with passage of 
schroeders legislation 
standing in front of a photo of enlisted men marching down the 
capitals constitution avenue foote described her nearly three 
decades of military service and how close she came to combat in 
vietnam in 1967 
ordes noted that eight women died in the vietnam war and that 
their names are engraved on the vietnam veterans memorial a few 
blocks from the capitol 
women have been in combat since this nation was born 
women have not been called combatants but they have been in 
combat ordes said 
molly yard president of now said the exclusion of women from 
combat is based on archaic ideas of what women and men should and 
should not do 
yard who is scheduled to testify tuesday at hearings on the 
issue said the inability of women in the military to accept combat 
positions limits their advancement in the service

president bush could grant the soviet union 
mostfavored nation trading status at the july economic summit 
in houston if the soviets enact legislation permitting free 
emigration commerce secretary robert mosbacher said monday 
bush announced at his malta summit meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev last december the united states would begin 
negotiating a trade agreement with the soviets wiping away nearly 
half a century of trade friction 
the package would include granting mostfavored nation trading 
status qualifying the soviet union for the lowest tariffs 
available to american trading partners soviet exports into the 
united states currently bear duties as much as 10 times higher than 
imports from other nations 
however bush first must waive the jacksonvanik amendment 
barring such status which congress passed in 1974 because of 
soviet refusal to allow free emigration a waiver would require 
bush to certify to congress that free emigration was being allowed 
in a speech to the antidefamation league of bnai brith 
mosbacher said soviet enactment and implementation of 
freeemigration legislation is expected this spring 
passage and implementation of such a law would mean that a 
jacksonvanik waiver could be signed sometime this summer in 
july in houston texas mosbacher said 
bush and other leaders of the group of seven plan to hold their 
next economic summit july 911 in houston other members are 
britain canada france italy japan and west germany 
the economic meeting will follow the next summit meeting between 
bush and gorbachev probably in washington during the last two 
weeks in june the exact dates have not been announced 
ussoviet negotiators hope to reach agreement on the overall 
trade package in time for the bushgorbachev summit the first 
round of talks were held last month and both sides expressed 
satisfaction with their progress a second round was held later in 
february in london and a third round is scheduled this month in

the soviet foreign minister said monday he 
is confident that angolas marxist government can soon reopen peace 
talks with the usbacked rebels it has been battling for 15 years 
eduard a shevardnadze made his comments before ending a 24hour 
visit to this country during the first trip to subsaharan africa 
by a soviet chief of diplomacy 
given the dynamic and rapid changes in the world recently 
it shouldnt be impossible to start renewed direct peace 
negotiations in the coming months shevardnadze told reporters 
after a twohour meeting with president jose eduardo dos santos 
he said a final peace accord could be signed by the time cuba 
completes the scheduled withdrawal of its estimated 50000 troops 
from angola by july 1 1991 
despite shevardnadzes remarks hopes for a quick peace seem 
faint earlier peace talks and a june truce have collapsed and 
fighting has intensified since the government launched an offensive 
in december 
western diplomats here noting the recent warming of ussoviet 
relations are expecting the superpowers to put more pressure on 
the angolan adversaries to come to peace 
shevardnadze left angola later monday for the zambian capital 
lusaka the official angolan news agency angop reported he will 
also visit zimbabwe namibia tanzania and nigeria 
the soviet diplomat stressed the kremlin supports dos santos

prospects for farm income have improved from 
earlier 1990 economic forecasts an agriculture department report 
showed monday 
combined with continuing strong demand for agricultural 
products currently higher prices due to tighter corn stocks and 
smaller hog inventories have brightened the outlook the report 
said 
analysts also said that the bulk of federal payments which 
figure prominently in annual farm income statistics continue to go 
to a relative handful of larger farming operations 
overall the net cash income of farmers was forecast at 54 
billion to 58 billion this year up from 53 billion in 1989 the 
record was 572 billion in 1988 previously the departments 
economic research service had put 1990 income in the range of 52 
billion to 57 billion 
as used by the agency net cash income measures the value of 
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments less 
outofpocket costs commodities sold may actually have been 
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed 
in another method of accounting the report said net farm income 
is expected to be in the range of 45 billion to 49 billion 
steady to down 8 percent from last years 49 billion previously 
it was forecast at 44 billion to 49 billion 
economists use net farm income to measure the value of 
agricultural production whether sold or stored in a calendar 
year plus government payments minus all costs including 
depreciation and other factors 
net farm income may drop as feed grain prices ease from the 
spikes caused by the 1988 drought the report said the lower 
prices will dampen the value of the fall harvest much of the fall 
1990 harvest will be sold in 1991 
the report said an analysis of usdas 1988 farm costs and 
returns survey showed that direct payments to farmers have been 
distributed on the basis of production as prescribed by current 
farm law 
of farms receiving direct government payments 32 percent 
received 90 percent of the payments the report said since 64 
percent of all farm receive no direct payments 90 percent of the 
payments go to only 12 percent of all farms 
greg gajewski senior editor of the report said there was no 
surprise in the breakdown of federal subsidies and that the pattern 
fit the trend 
direct federal payments to farmers peaked at about 167 billion 
in 1987 according to the agency then dropped to 145 billion in 
1988 and to around 11 million in 1989 as market prices improved 
thus reducing many of the subsidy rates a further reduction to as 
low as 8 billion is expected this year 
the report also said that improved weather has brightened 
prospects for the us winter wheat crop 
early indicators in western europe canada and australia point 
to wheat production gains there as well the report said wheat 
prices are falling 
in asia a bumper 198990 rice crop is being harvested with 
record or nearrecord output forecast for china bangladesh 
vietnam thailand and india 
but us stocks are low and the thais are holding stocks back 
for sale later in the year the report added so prices remain 
strong and us exports are slowing

leaders of the organization of african 
unity met here monday and urged african states not to resume 
diplomatic relations with south africa until further reforms are 
made to end racial segregation 
the 50member organization of african unitys ad hoc committee 
on southern africa also warned governments that easing their 
sanctions against south africa would slow reforms 
but the delegates agreed to encourage the blackled african 
national congress to pursue powersharing talks with the whiteled 
government 
south africas president fw de klerk said he will hold talks 
with the anc april 11 as a prelude to formal negotiations on 
powersharing 
de klerk legalized the anc and freed its leader nelson mandela 
in february to pave the way for talks 
the euphoria that has developed has led some leaders in 
africa and abroad to think that all is over in south africa and 
they are entitled to reestablish contact with the regime anc 
secretarygeneral alfred nzo said 
if this happens it is a signal to de klerk to block any 
further progress he added 
zambias president kenneth kaunda welcomed the release of 
mandela but said pretoria should do more to pave the way for 
formal constitutional talks 
it is the pretoria regime that should unlock the gates to 
negotiations he said 
it was the first summit meeting since the committee met in the 
zimbabwe capital harare last august to endorse an anc plan for 
talks with south africa

the head of nasas space flight program 
acknowledged monday that repair and maintenance problems exist in 
the planned space station but said they can be fixed by design 
changes long before the station is built 
im not worried about it said bill lenoir the space 
agencys associate administrator for space flight its one of 
many things at this point in the design that is inherently fuzzy 
a report in mondays new york times said nasa discovered 
belatedly that the station planned for assembly beginning in 1995 
would require about 2200 hours of maintenance each year by 
astronauts working in the hazardous open space environment 
lenoir said a more realistic but still inflated estimate is 
550 hours which he also considers too much 
at this point admittedly we dont understand in depth the 
reliability of the subsystems and pieces of subsystems he said 
in an interview so weve made some unrealistic assumptions like 
everything that can fail will fail and it will fail once a year 
then we multiply it all together and say well gee thats 
550 hours we know thats harsh and probably higher than realistic 
and thats what well be spending between now and december working 
on lenoir said the figure is exaggerated even more he said by 
being multiplied by four to 2200 hours 
the times said nasa investigators discovered the setback 
early this year but lenoir said it has been an issue thats been 
worked on for six months and part of a preliminary design process 
that will continue until a review in december 
weve taken this quick and dirty bottomsup assessment and now 
we are going to dig in itembyitem and say whats the real 
requirement and how will we deal with it lenoir said 
i wouldnt say im not worried about it but im worried about 
it no more than anything else im paid to worry about everything 
the newspapers report said there were 5578 parts outside the 
stations inhabited modules that could be replaced if they failed 
and that those calculations increased the work load by 30 percent 
lenoir said maintenance and repair of any such items can be 
planned in four ways 
i can live with it i can do it robotically i can make it 
require less maintenance by upping its reliability or i can move 
it inside the pressurized living module so it becomes an 
intravehicular rather than an extravehicular job 
lenoir said it would be wrong to think the space station has a 
major problem when in fact we have a minor problem business as 
usual we are working on it and we are on schedule for coping with 
it

the man who may decide who will head israels 
new government is an unlikely kingmaker a 69yearold rabbi better 
known for his torah scholarship than foreign policy 
rabbi ovadia yosef spiritual leader of the ultraorthodox shas 
party made his power felt earlier when he put aside his daily task 
of guiding his flock and advised prime minister yitzhak shamir to 
accept usbacked peace proposals 
shamir said no and yosef then used his spiritual authority to 
topple shamirs government by withholding the parliamentary votes 
of his shas party last thursday 
yosefs views angered his mostly rightwing followers many of 
whom back shamirs likud party and a few ran into his jerusalem 
synagogue shouting traitor 
a tugofwar followed in shas and the pressure produced an 
apparent turnaround in the partys support for labor still 
yosefs strong views on peace could decide whether shas backs labor 
or likud 
in a rare television appearance sunday yosef argued that he 
toppled shamirs government because it could not make peace 
you are inviting war if you support such a government yosef 
said dressed in traditional dark robes with gold embroidery and 
sunglasses he needs to wear to protect his sensitive eyes 
he called shamirs government the extremist of extremes and 
argued that it would not have been able to give a positive 
reply to the us plan for the first open dialogue ever between 
an israeli government and palestinians 
what would the nations of the world say then these israelis 
dont want peace they want war yosef said and afterward 
when god forbid all the arab states will rise up and make war 
against us how many will be killed who will account for the 
spilled blood 
yosef is an israeli former chief rabbi of sephardic jews those 
of middle east or north african origin who now constitute a 
majority in israel 
born in baghdad iraqs capital he served as deputy chief rabbi 
of egypt before moving to israel here he was a religious court 
judge author of studies of jewish religious writings and founder 
in 1984 of shas an acronym for the sephardic torah guardians 
he created the party in reaction to what was perceived as 
discrimination against religious sephardic jews by the 
ultraorthodox religious establishment which was dominated by 
ashkenazis or european jews 
shas quickly gained support among secular sephardis as well 
today with six seats it is the third largest party in the 
120seat knesset or parliament three other religious parties 
control 12 seats 
sephardic jews comprise roughly 55 percent of israels jewish 
population they generally are poorer and more conservative than 
ashkenazi jews their overwhelming support enabled the likud to end 
29 years of rule by the centerleft labor party in 1977 
but since the 27monthold intefadeh or palestinian uprising 
has made peace a more urgent concern yosef and some other 
sephardic leaders have surprised their flock with moderate 
statements 
first yosef on a festive homecoming to egypt last summer 
declared that he believed the religious commandment to prevent 
bloodshed superseded israels right to the occupied territories 
then a few months ago another sephardic spiritual leader 
baba baruch abuhatzeira went further and advocated talks with 
the palestine liberation organization which israel views as a 
terrorist organization 
both sephardic and ashkenazi spiritual leaders have generally 
exhibited concern primarily for matters of immediate interest to 
their flocks funding for religious schools and housing and 
demands to pass legislation favorable to religion 
that is why it was surprising yosef got involved in the larger 
political question of how israel should make peace with the arabs

us aid to relocate contra rebels into their 
nicaraguan homeland will go only to fighters who agree to lay down 
their arms assistant secretary of state bernard aronson said 
monday 
this package is meant to provide a new livelihood for 
unarmed resistance members who return peacefully to nicaragua 
aronson said in testimony supporting president bushs request for 
300 million to aid nicaragua this year 
the aid package includes about 32 million to pay costs of 
moving rebel fighters and their families back into nicaragua and 
could cover the costs of items like seed fertilizer and tools to 
get them started in farming 
rep matthew mchugh dny a member of the house 
appropriations foreign operations subcommittee voiced concern over 
reports that armed rebels have infiltrated into the country from 
their camps along the honduran border and are demanding that 
enclaves be established where they can remain with their weapons 
there is a certain degree of skepticism out in the country and 
in congress over the intentions of the rebels said mchugh a 
consistent opponent of the past us policy of financing the 
contras 
he called contra demobilization the most serious potential 
problem for the transfer of power from the leftist sandinista 
government to the opposition coalition led by violeta chamorro who 
won the feb 25 election 
aronson said the administration believes its time for the 
combatants to put their arms down and go back to civic life but 
added theres no button to push and 10 years of fears on 
both sides 
one option for easing the rebels back is to establish 
enclaves in the nicaraguan countryside where the rebels could 
congregate with united nations peacekeeping troops around them as 
a buffer to separate them from sandinista soldiers aronson said 
the un is contemplating expanding its peacekeeping force by as 
many as 800 men he said but it was unclear whether contras would 
be required to forfeit their weapons before entering nicaragua or 
only after arriving in the enclaves he added 
there is jockeying on both sides aronson told the

the democratic opposition groups 
that successfully demanded the ouster of communist party chief 
jambyn batmonh put up posters on monday supporting him as president 
the posters urged ulan bator residents to rally tuesday 
afternoon in sukhbator square in the city center on the eve of a 
legislative session expected to replace batmonh as president 
the ruling communist party meanwhile said its central 
committee would meet tuesday for a second time in two weeks to 
discuss restructuring the party in the face of growing popular 
pressure 
the party has ruled since 1921 when it came to power in a 
sovietbacked revolution the sparsely populated kremlin satellite 
sandwiched between china and the soviet union allows red army 
troops to be based on its soil 
the opposition groups which sprang up the past four months to 
end the communists monopoly on politics won batmonhs ouster as 
party general secretary last week after repeated demonstrations in 
the square 
a veteran party member tied less closely to mongolias past 
dictatorial leadership gombogavyn ochirbat replaced him and a 
new politburo and secretariat were named 
the opposition said it wanted a new communist leadership because 
the old one had failed to keep promises to move toward democracy 
and shake up the inefficient planned economy however opposition 
activists said batmonh was an honest man who they trusted to 
continue as president in what they consider as a transitional 
period to full democracy 
if someone more conservative is elected he might stop the 
democracy movement said a member of the opposition 
in multiparty talks which began nearly two weeks ago the 
ruling communist party agreed batmonh would resign as party chief 
but stay on as president the opposition was surprised and upset 
when batmonh offered his resignation as president last week 
delegates to the legislature called the great peoples hural 
said they expect to accept batmonhs resignation 
batmonh was replaced in his party post it would not be 
suitable for such a person to be president said erdene a 
36yearold worker and deputy from darhan city 
however he and other delegates agreed that the new reformist 
notion of separating party and state should be observed and 
ochirbat should not be chosen president 
none of the delegates was able to suggest a replacement for 
batmonh they said they expected to retain dumaagiyn sodnom as 
prime minsiter sodman was a member of the ousted party politburo 
and also offered to resign his state post 
delegates to the communistdominated 370seat hural began 
arriving in ulan bator on monday for its annual session which 
begins wednesday and is expected to last four days 
many climbed off buses at the hotel ulan bator wearing labor 
hero medals and small pins of the national flag on their 
traditional nomads garb 
this is the peak season in breeding livestock they are giving 
birth and there is so much work waiting for us said ikhlas a 
55yearold herdsmen from western mongolia 
but he said the session is important because it will debate 
and probably approve a law providing for multiparty elections 
legislative elections are not due until next year and the 
communists say they are confident they will win hural delegates 
seemed unenthusiastic about the opposition demands for early 
elections this year 
i support the current deputies ikhlas said 
dolgormaa a woman teacher from southern mongolia said 
opposition parties should be allowed hural seats if they work with 
the communists 
but if the opposition parties are in conflict with the ruling 
party and are demanding and aggressive then i will not support 
it she said

defense secretary dick cheney said monday the 
administration has cut the pentagon budget as far as we can 
responsibly go as the white house denied a report that president 
bush could accept a major cut in military spending 
cheney said in a speech that the administration had made real 
cuts in its 307 billion military spending plan for 1991 that 
respond directly and rationally to the changes in eastern 
europe and the soviet union 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater rejected a report 
that the administration could accept cutting the pentagon budget by 
11 billion 
our position is that we have proposed a budget that calls for 
something like 39 billion in cuts we intend to stick with that 
proposal fitzwater said 
the new york times reported sunday the administration is willing 
to accept a 10 billion to 11 billion cut in fiscal 1991 military 
spending in response to pressure from capitol hill for even more 
severe reductions 
there is not a 10 or 12 billion cut that we are 
prepared to accept fitzwater said however the spokesman added 
every numbers negotiable 
we believe adequate national security is based on the 39 
million cut thats the one that we proposed he said 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 the administration has 
requested 307 billion in budget authority and 303 billion in 
outlays for the defense department the department of energy and 
military construction projects 
the administrations request although higher than last year is 
two percent below the level required to keep up with inflation 
but some members of congress with an eye to the developments in 
the soviet union and europe amid economic presssures at home are 
pressing for heftier cuts 
cheney in a speech to the american defense preparedness 
association acknowledged the relationship between the superpowers 
clearly has taken a turn for the better and the threat of a 
sudden soviet invasion of western europe clearly has receded 
but he argued great uncertainty remains about the course of 
reform in the soviet union and the soviets retain enormous 
military capabilities particularly in strategic nuclear weapons 
systems 
cheneys view has clashed with the more sanguine public view cia 
director william webster has taken of the potential soviet military 
threat cheney said monday that my job calls for me to err on the 
side of caution 
it would be irresponsible of me to run out and focus only 
on the good news he said 
even so cheney said the pentagon has cut its projections for 
spending over the upcoming fiveyear period by 231 billion 
during his past year in office 
by march of 1995 defense spending will be down to the lowest 
share of gnp since before world war ii these are real cuts they 
are big and they relate directly and rationally to the reduced 
threat but these cuts are as far as we can responsibly go 
cheney said 
the former congressman from wyoming accused his former 
colleagues on capitol hill of having a memory lapse in 
demanding steep defense cuts because they rejected his proposals 
for killing such programs as the v22 osprey tiltroter plane and 
the f14d jet fighter last year 
the resistance to cuts we keep running into is right up 
there on capitol hill with those folks who say they want me to 
cut the defense budget but of course they dont want me to close 
any bases shut down any production lines or do anything that 
maight have an impact on somebodys base back home on the 
district cheney said 
in his speech the defense secretary also said he and bush 
want to keep moving forward as fast as we possibly can on the 
strategic defense initiative

the government offered a 100000 reward monday for the capture 
of the bomber who destroyed a drug enforcement administration 
office in fort myers fla but the agency concedes it can do 
little to prevent future attacks 
the fbi has issued a nationwide alert for jeffrey a matthews 
23 an elusive drug suspect who allegedly threatened the dea after 
his indictment thursday 
there have been no warrants issued yet for anyone in the 
explosion but we are following some good leads fbi spokesman 
brian kenscel said 
the dea and fbi jointly announced the 100000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the bomber or 
bombers but they did not name a suspect 
matthews halfbrother john lewis ciganek 22 surrendered to 
authorities sunday in the florida keys and has been questioned 
about the bombing the fbi spokesman said he refused to say what 
if anything the suspect told agents 
ciganek was arraigned in fort myers federal court monday on the 
drug indictment 
i just want a fair trial ciganek said after declaring 
himself indigent and in need of a courtappointed attorney he was 
ordered held without bond 
saturdays bombing destroyed the dea office building in a quiet 
fort myers neighborhood remnants of the pipe bomb which 
apparently used gasoline as a fire accelerant have been sent to 
fbi laboratories in washington for analysis 
washington dea spokesman bill ruzzamenti said that although 
agency offices around the world have been informed about the 
bombing there have been no new security measures taken 
the situation in fort myers is an isolated incident he said 
but in yakima wash a key station on the northwest drug route 
from mexico head dea agent robert dreisbach acknowledged security 
has been heightened although he would not disclose details 
we have taken certain security precautions as a result of fort 
myers and continuing threats to all dea offices from 
drugtrafficking organizations dreisbach said 
jim braseth agent in charge in minneapolis says his office has 
not received any threats nor has it inreased security because of 
the fort myers bombing in indianapolis david h mcdougal the 
resident agent in charge said that although the bombing appears 
local this just shows that it is a war 
the bombing along with threats from colombian drug dealers and 
the slayings of agents around the world points to the agencys 
limits in protecting itself the dea acknowledges 
ruzzamenti mentioned the kidnapping and murder of undercover 
investigator enrique kiki camarena in mexico and the slaying of 
a dea agent in the bogota colombia office 
over the last few years we have certainly become much more 
securityconscious than we were ruzzamenti said the drug 
traffickers of today are much more violent and brutal than they 
used to be we have seen what happens to agents overseas 
the bombing will likely make agents more careful said miami dea 
spokesman john fernandes he said he still checks carefully before 
entering his car and follows different routes to and from his home 
even though he no longer works in the streets 
but surrounding dea offices with armed guards for instance 
would make it difficult for the agency to function in a free 
society 
we cant shut ourselves off behind an iron wall fernandes 
said we work with the public

state television attacked the british royal 
family on monday as iraq increased the tone of its attacks on 
london for its condemnation of the hanging of a londonbased 
journalist 
the television upbraided members of queen elizabeth iis family 
for alleged immorality broadcasting segments of programs about the 
monarchy 
elizabeth does not feel any shame despite the fact that her 
family members are hanging out their dirty linen before the 
people a tv announcer said 
a buckingham palace spokesman asked in london whether he had 
any comment on the iraqi tv attack replied monday night no not 
at all 
the television claimed that prince charles heir to the throne 
married diana even though he knew there were many men in her life 
before him including his brother prince andrew 
the television announcer asked how charles could marry such a 
playgirl without giving the source of his comments on diana or 
further details 
diana was a friend of the royal family before her marriage and 
knew andrew charles and others from childhood but london 
newspapers have not carried reports that such relationships were 
anything like those portrayed by iraqi tv 
for women premarital love affairs are taboo in much of the arab 
world and would bring deep shame upon their families 
the television showed scenes of the royals in their leisure time 
and said they were living at the expense of millions of poor people 
in britain 
it said andrew married sarah ferguson although he knew she had 
had a love affair with a businessman 
miss ferguson now known as the duchess of york dated several 
men before her marriage including a romance with a motorracing 
millionaire there was no effort to conceal it 
the state television broadcast other details on the life of the 
monarchy that it said showed bad behavior on the part of the royal 
family 
farzad bazoft 31 an iranianborn reporter for the british 
weekly the observer was hanged thursday after being convicted of 
spying for britain and israel he was arrested while trying to 
investigate reports that an explosion at an iraqi military complex 
killed hundreds of people 
bazoft and his newspaper denied he was a spy editor donald 
trelford said alleged confessions produced by the iraqi authorities 
were clearly extracted under duress 
the execution outraged britain which recalled its ambassador 
expelled six iraqi military trainees canceled a trade mission and 
suspended visits by government ministers 
london stopped short of breaking relations however 
thousands of iraqis demonstrated saturday in baghdad to protest 
the british actions the television report on the british monarchy 
was clearly intended as part of a growing campaign against britain 
and its leaders

nicolae ceausescus henchmen monday 
won a postponement of an appeal of their convictions for backing 
the romanian dictators order to fire on protesters during the 
december revolution 
the defense attorneys argued that the convictions of complicity 
to commit genocide were the first ever in romania and that they 
needed to do research outside the country to effectively defend 
their clients on appeal 
tudor postelnicu emil bobu manea manescu and ion dinca pleaded 
guilty to the charges and were convicted last month they are 
appealing their sentences which range up to life in prison 
bobu 62 was secretary of the communist party central committee 
and the thirdranking member of the ceausescu hierarchy after the 
dictator and his wife elena 
ceausescu was toppled after the demonstrations grew into a 
violent revolution and he and his wife were executed on christmas 
day following a secret military trial 
postelnicu 59 was ceausescus interior minister manescu 74 
was vice president of the former state council and dinca 62 was 
a politburo member as were his codefendants 
i ask for a new period of time for the court appeal since i 
regard the charge of genocide against the four defendants as a 
premiere for us and for international judiciary practice virgil 
rata postelnicus attorney told the military tribunal hearing the 
appeal 
he noted that in 1973 romania ratified the 1948 international 
convention on genocide but said he knew very little about how it 
has been applied over the years 
i personally am handicapped and i more or less improvised from 
the few pages of international law that i had at my disposal 
rata said 
he also said political murder cannot be included within the 
charge of genocide 
crimes murders and massacres existed before rata said 
citing the mass killing of alleged communists after the overthrow 
of indonesian president sukarno in 1965 no state be it western 
or eastern ever raised the issue of genocide then 
the defense attorneys for the others agreed with the arguments 
and court president col cornel badoiu postponed the appeal until 
april 23 
the prosecution agreed with the delay on the grounds that the 
defense should have all necessary information to conduct the appeal 
during the onehour session at a former police training academy 
the four defendants sat in a prisoners dock clad in the 
graystriped wool tunics and trousers customarily worn by romanian 
prison inmates 
the four whose hair had been closely cropped in prison 
conferred with each other during the session and chatted with their 
guards during a break in the proceedings 
manescu wiped his eyes frequently but the other three showed 
little emotion manescus wife sat several rows from the prisoners 
dock 
i swear with my hand on the cross that he is not guilty she 
said in an interview 
he didnt give any orders to shoot demonstrators he only 
followed them and put into practice the measures that had been 
dictated to him said mrs manescu who refused to give her first 
name 
central to the guilty verdict was a dec 17 politburo meeting at 
which ceausescu announced his intent to use deadly force against 
protesters to quell demonstrations that began in the western city 
of timisoara 
ceausescu offered to resign after several politburo members 
protested his demand for the resignations of postelnicu defense 
minister vasile milea and chief of security iulian vlad for not 
carrying out his orders to shoot protesters in timisoara 
ultimately the politburo members asked ceausescu to remain on 
the prosecution argued during the trial that the defendants 
could have prevented the slaughter of demonstrators by accepting 
ceausescus resignation

candidates in an ideologically charged 
gubernatorial race and a pair of bitter congressional contests 
trudged toward the finish line monday but most voters were 
apparently ignoring them 
sunny skies and temperatures in the low 50s were forecast for 
tuesdays primary but state election officials predicted that 
little more than onefourth of illinois 6 million registered 
voters would cast ballots 
however a 44 percent turnout was projected among chicagos 14 
million voters partly because of a hotly contested highly 
publicized fourway contest for county board president in cook 
county which includes chicago 
the gubernatorial race the mostwatched contest statewide 
matched twoterm secretary of state jim edgar the candidate backed 
by the state gop hierarchy against conservative political 
organizer steven baer 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that 
president bush and gop national chairman lee atwater both supported 
edgar 
baer has attacked edgars support of abortion rights and 
extension of a temporary state income tax increase he has dubbed 
edgar pinocchio for what he said were contradictory statements 
on taxes 
edgar aides have accused baer of lying about edgars positions 
on abortion edgar says he supports the us supreme courts 1973 
roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion 
edgar told a rally monday in the state capitol rotunda that a 
large turnout will be good for democracy and very good for 
jim edgar baer held out hope for an upset fueled by a 
getoutthevote effort targeting antiabortion households and 
conservatives 
i think weve done everything thats humanly possible and i 
think there are going to be a lot of surprised faces tomorrow he 
said at a campaign stop in springfield 
in one of the congressional races democratic rep sidney yates 
of chicago faced a wellfinanced challenge from chicago alderman 
edwin eisendrath who claimed that a weekend canvass showed him 
leading the 20term congressman 
yates 80 complained that the 31yearold eisendrath had 
unfairly maligned him with a campaign pamphlet comparing yates to 
an antique typewriter and an obsolete television set 
eisendrath rebuffed the accusation monday at a meeting with 
campaign workers saying theres nothing wrong with pointing out 
that a man is out of touch 
on the citys south side flamboyant and controversial fiveterm 
democratic us rep gus savage was locked in a rematch with 
educator melvin reynolds who characterized savage as totally 
ineffective 
in the cook county board race there was lastminute 
barnstorming by frontrunners richard phelan who was special 
counsel in the house ethics committees investigation of former 
house speaker jim wright and former state appellate judge eugene 
pincham 
voters at a lunchtime phelan appearance in downtown chicago said 
the cook county contests had overshadowed the other primaries for 
offices such as governor 
is that tomorrow i didnt even know about it said richard 
gutierrez 25 of cicero its all been about cook county thats 
where most of the medias been focused not the governors race 
you just see them on tv and the names run together added 
jamie mortellaro 25 of chicago 
the statewide ballot was almost completely clear of contested 
races the result of furious maneuvering last year by party leaders 
to ensure their top candidates a clear shot at the fall election 
twoterm democratic attorney general neil hartigan was 
guaranteed a fall match with the winner of the gop gubernatorial 
primary while us sen paul simon and his republican challenger 
us rep lynn martin were unopposed in their respective primaries 
but party leaders favorites were struggling in the handful of 
contested races 
the democrats slated candidate for cook county board president 
state sen ted lechowicz was running last in the fourway race 
according to independent polls cook county clerk stanley kusper 
was also in the race 
slated candidates for state treasurer and comptroller were also 
locked in close races

weather forecasters broke more bad news 
monday to parched greece there is no rain in sight for the nation 
which is suffering from its worst drought in a century 
the weather bureau said no rain had fallen in the agricultural 
north for 75 days and bureau spokesman andreas lazanis said none 
was forecast for at least the next six days 
the drought has endangered winter crops and spring planting 
according to agricultural officials 
residents of yiannitsa a farming community near salonica in 
northern greece prayed for rain at sunday religious services 
rainfall also was very low last winter and the government last 
week announced an emergency plan to drill for extra water because 
athens reservoirs reportedly contain only enough to last until 
november 
no rainfall figures for the latest weeks were available but 
figures released by the weather bureau indicated that january 
rainfall in the athens area was less than a fifth of that months 
average of 2 inches 
in an interview with the newspaper ta nea on monday environment 
minister costas liaskas said 31 million had been allocated to 
drill for underground reserves near athens 
he said the main reason for the water shortage was the drought 
but we must add that the water has not been managed correctly 
liaskas said 
he said a lot of water had been lost because of leaking 
aquaducts

thousands of students held an allday 
rally monday demanding that direct president elections replace the 
electoral college dominated by elderly nationalist politicians 
elected in china before 1949 
the protest came two days before the 752seat electoral college 
known as the national assembly meets to select the next president 
the only candidate is president lee tenghui of the ruling 
nationalist party 
about 3000 students boycotted classes at about a dozen 
universities throughout taiwan to take part in the first major 
student demonstration here since this island nation lifted martial 
law in 1987 after 38 years 
in heavy rain they linked arms and sang united we have 
strength as students we have strength in chiang kaishek 
memorial park named after the nationalist leader who moved his 
government to taiwan after losing a civil war to communist forces 
on the chinese mainland in 1949 
students pledged to continue the protest until after the 
presidential election about half those at the rally announced 
plans to stay in the park overnight 
sixteen classmates began a hunger strike they said would last 
until the government responded to their demands 
the deputies in the national assembly many in their 80s and 
90s were allowed to remain indefinitely in office to support the 
nationalist claim to still be the sole legitimate government of all 
of china 
the students also asked the government to issue a timetable for 
democratic change 
they rejected a call by lee to end their occupation of the park 
which began with a sitin by 200 students last friday 
students shunned political demonstrations under martial law and 
rarely participated in protests organized by the opposition 
democratic progressive party the past three years 
as the political situation deteriorated students are coming 
out of their fears about participation in political movements 
said chang chungtung history professor at national taiwan 
university 
university students in beijing occupied tiananmen square for 
weeks last spring to press demands for a freer society in communist 
china and some demonstrators here acknowledged they were trying to 
recreate that spirit 
almost all of taiwans 20 million people are ethnic chinese and 
the beijing student movement crushed by troops received wide 
sympathy here

visiting former president jimmy 
carter on monday accused israel of violating palestinian rights in 
the occupied lands and argued against settling soviet jews in 
jerusalem government officials said 
his remarks came on a day when a 20yearold palestinian was 
shot and killed in a stonethrowing clash with israeli troops in 
the occupied gaza strip according to arab reports an 18yearold 
died of a head wound suffered a day earlier 
carter met privately with officials during a visit to an 
absorption center for israeli immigrants monday in mevasseret zion 
five miles west of jerusalem 
the settlement of soviet immigrants in jerusalem serves only 
to spark palestinian protests and should be discouraged an 
official speaking anonymously quoted carter as saying during the 
meeting 
on sunday carter told jerusalem mayor teddy kollek that 
jerusalem should remain a united city president bush has equated 
jewish neighborhoods in east jerusalem with west bank settlements 
on a visit to amman jordan carter called settlement of soviet 
jewish immigrants in the west bank and gaza strip an impediment 
to peace 
israel captured the territories along with arab east jerusalem 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war it annexed east 
jerusalem as part of its capital and the jewish neighborhoods 
built around the city are not considered occupied territory by most 
of the israeli public 
israel denies it directs immigrants to the occupied lands 
saying they are free to choose where they want to live about 200 
soviet immigrants have so far settled in the west bank and gaza 
strip 
israeli leaders have said they expect thousands of soviet 
immigrants in the next decade because of liberalized soviet exit 
policies and us visa restrictions 
children greeted the former us president with flowers and 
kisses on his arrival at the absorption center a temporary home 
where about 800 immigrants spend their first months here studying 
the hebrew language 
however children from observant rightwing families in the 
surrounding areas protested the visit waving israeli flags and 
holding a banner saying jerusalem not for sale 
the rightwing tehiya party sent carter a telegram saying he was 
not a wanted guest in our country the national news agency 
itim said 
your policy is not neutral it represents plo and palestinian 
positions the telegram reportedly said the government and many 
israelis consider the palestine liberation organization a terrorist 
group 
after a meeting earlier monday with directors of the leftwing 
israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories carter said he was distressed by reports that 
palestinians were jailed without trial and that houses were 
demolished to punish arab families 
he also accused israel of excessive use of firearms by the 
military that are not under lifethreatening situations 
what we are talking about is an authoritative government that 
is in charge that is depriving the people under its control of 
their basic human rights carter told reporters 
i think the intefadeh uprising is being perpetuated 
partially by the abuse of the palestinians 
the latest fatality occurred in the sheik radwan neighborhood of 
gaza city when soldiers fired live ammunition to quell 
stonethrowing arab reports said 
arab hospital officials identified the victim as osama 
elsharwish of gaza city 
also monday nafi rafik zakout of jabaliya refugee camp died in 
israels tel hashomer hospital he was hit in the head with a 
plastic bullet fired by troops during a clash in gaza city a day 
earlier 
the army confirmed zakouts death and said it was checking the 
report on elsharwish 
the deaths raised to 666 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians in the 27monthold palestinian 
uprising against israeli rule in the territories 
an additional 198 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities 
fortythree israelis have died in the violence

a secret government security 
unit planned bombings and killings and it once employed a witch 
doctor to put a spell on archbishop desmond tutu a former agent 
testified monday 
abraham snake van zyl told an inquiry hearing that agents of 
the secret civilian cooperation bureau had conducted a major 
underground campaign against antiapartheid activists he said the 
main targets were the african national congress nelson mandelas 
group and the south african communist party 
disruption of the enemy ranged from breaking windows to 
killing he told the official inquiry 
van zyl a former police officer said he and other agents tried 
to use muti or magic against tutu an antiapartheid activist 
who won the 1984 nobel peace prize he said they hanged a monkey 
fetus prepared by a witch doctor in tutus driveway and drove 
magically treated nails into the driveway 
he did not say exactly how this was supposed to affect tutu 
the government has ordered an investigation into the cooperation 
bureau which was reportedly run by the south african defense 
forces to wage a secret war against groups fighting the white 
governments apartheid policies of racial discrimination south 
african newspapers have reported that top generals were linked to 
the units activities 
opposition leaders contend the security forces are tied to the 
deaths or disappearance of dozens of antigovernment activists in 
recent years several former police officers have admitted 
involvement in killings of government opponents and other illegal 
activities 
van zyl who said he was speaking because he wanted the truth to 
come out also said the unit bombed a school in cape town in 1989 
because it was reportedly used as a meeting place by antiapartheid

joseph hazelwoods defense lost a legal 
battle monday over a single word that could affect how jurors 
decide whether the exxon valdez skipper was drunk when his ship 
went aground 
the word was noticeably and was contained in a legal 
instruction that told jurors to decide whether hazelwood was 
noticeably impaired on the night of the nations largest oil 
spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone removed the word and said he 
would tell jurors they must only decide whether hazelwood was 
impaired 
there are a lot of people who can mask their impairment he 
told lawyers in explaining his decision 
defense lawyer dick madson appeared stunned by the ruling 
saying this is the first time ive ever heard of this 
madson said in his years of defending drunken driving cases in 
fairbanks the term noticeably impaired always has been 
included in jury instructions 
my gosh its been around for a long time he told the judge 
but assistant district attorney sam adams argued all we have 
to prove is that he was impaired not stumbledown drunk 
hazelwood is charged with one felony criminal mischief and 
three misdemeanors reckless endangerment operating a vessel while 
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil 
his tanker ran aground on bligh reef last march 24 spilling 
nearly 11 million gallons of alaska north slope crude oil wreaking 
devastation over hundreds of miles of shoreline rich with fish 
birds and other wildlife 
the question of whether hazelwood showed signs of intoxication 
has been a key element in his trial with numerous witnesses 
testifying that the skipper did not stagger slur his words or show 
any other evidence that he was drunk three witnesses said they 
smelled alcohol on his breath 
the judges ruling came during a discussion of legal 
instructions which will be given to jurors after attorneys deliver 
their final arguments tuesday 
in other rulings the judge said he would take judicial 
notice of the fact the us coast guard had a regulation barring 
tanker crews from drinking alcohol less than four hours before 
sailing but he refused to give an instruction on the point 
because the regulation is not state law 
he also refused a proposed prosecution instruction that would 
have told jurors the coast guards blood alcohol limit for 
operating a commercial vessel is 04 well below the state level of 
10 for drunken driving hazelwoods blood alcohol level was below 
the state limit but violated the coast guards 
the judge noted the coast guard standard is a federal 
regulation not a state law and has not been admitted into 
evidence at the trial 
he rejected a lastminute request by the defense to tell jurors 
that reckless driving and negligent driving are lesser included 
offenses of criminal mischief 
the instruction would have given jurors the option of convicting 
hazelwood on the reduced charges rather than the single felony

the soviet unions reported consideration of 
polishstyle radical economic reforms indicates an admission that 
perestroika so far has been insufficient says one of the 
architects of polands plan 
but the soviet union must not follow the polish strategy too 
closely because there are substantial differences between the 
countries economies said jeffrey sachs a harvard university 
economist and one of polands main economic advisers since the 
country abandoned communist rule last year 
the soviet news agency interfax reported monday that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev is preparing to implement drastic 
changes effective july 1 including reforming the stateset pricing 
system selling off stateowned industries and developing a plan to 
make the ruble convertible 
the news agency said the strategy was developed by 60 soviet 
economists who modeled it after the polish plan 
sachs in a telephone interview said that despite soviet 
attempts at reforms during gorbachevs five years in power the 
country in some ways has more dire problems than poland 
for one soviets have terrible overhangs of money 
disproportionately high savings due to a lack of goods for 
consumers to purchase he said that means making the ruble 
convertible to foreign currencies could prompt high inflation 
poland by comparison had suffered years of rampant inflation 
that ate up savings and has started to subside under the reforms 
sachs said 
he said the soviet union could lower the money supply by setting 
a limit on savings acount withdrawals by doubling both wages and 
prices or even by confiscation 
in addition poland is much further along in decentralizing 
control of industry sachs said whereas the soviet union remains 
mired in inefficient central planning 
and he noted poland in previous years had been more concerned 
than the soviet union about developing trade with other countries 
sachs also pointed out that polands reforms are bolstered by 
substantial economic aid from other countries the soviet union 
must be willing to accept similar aid he said 
the soviet union thus far has appeared to be offended by 
suggestions that it accept aid on the order of the marshall plan 
the blueprint for european economic recovery after world war ii 
but interfax quoted gorbachev aide nikolai petrakov as saying such 
aid had not been ruled out 
sachs roughly estimated that the soviet union would need about 
90 billion in foreign aid 
although western countries might balk at coming up with that 
much in aid it would be the deal of the century for opening up 
trade with the west and reducing western defense expenditures 
through the reduction of military tension sachs said 
despite the differences between the polish and soviet economies 
sachs said the soviet union can expect to have one experience in 
common with poland if it undertakes reforms that go beyond 
perestroikas sofar mild moves substantial unemployment 
after decades of nearly full employment about 150000 poles 
have become unemployed since the reforms were implemented 
it is an inevitable offshoot said sachs who added that he 
believed the unemployment would be shortterm suffering for 
longterm gain i would tell them to keep their perspective

a frustrated federal judge ordered attorney 
general dick thornburgh to court to explain the governments 
abandonment of a settlement involving a drugladen plane leased to 
us agents and linked to the contras 
us district judge patrick kelly said the case involved 
criminal conduct by the united states 
this case stinks to high heaven kelly said during a hearing 
on a lawsuit over the loss of the twinengine beech king air which 
was ditched in the caribbean sea on jan 3 1983 
the pilot convicted smuggler michael toliver later testified 
that he flew arms to nicaraguas contra rebels and illegal drugs 
back to the united states several times under the supervision of 
federal agents 
kelly had canceled a trial set for january after being told in 
november that the case had been settled through mediation 
but on friday richard montague an assistant us attorney 
general from washington told kelly that justice department 
officials never approved the settlement and said the case should 
go to trial 
kelley ordered thornburgh to appear at an april 2 hearing in 
wichita to straighten out the lawsuits status 
thornburgh aide michael robinson said monday that the attorney 
general had not yet decided how to respond to the order 
kelly told montague that the case involves the transport of 
drugs by agents of the united states or with the acquiescence of 
the united states montague objected saying that toliver was the 
only witness making such statements and that his credibility was 
questionable the attorney said the insurance case had nothing to 
do with those statements 
kelly said he was frustrated by the governments lack of action 
in response to tolivers disclosures 
i have heard nothing the judge said frankly what i have 
had is stonewalling at the hands of the united states and im not 
going to have any more 
kelly had been so alarmed by tolivers statements that he 
ordered transcripts of the testimony delivered to the fbi cia and 
to thenpresident reagan at bethesda naval hospital 
the president of the united states advised me in spades that 
the attorney general was fully familiar with it and i dont think 
you are kelly told montague who was representing the justice 
department 
montague said the question of whether a criminal investigation 
was warranted was up to the attorney general not the judge 
toliver testified in kellys court in 1987 that he made two 
trips to honduras and colombia the previous year with arms for the 
contras and returned to the united states with loads of cocaine and 
marijuana 
he said he landed at homestead air force base fla with one 
drug load and that he worked as an informant and contract employee 
under federal supervision 
toliver testified that he wasnt working for the government when 
he crashed the plane he said he had disconnected a us customs 
service homing device aboad the plane and took off in another 
direction with a load of marijuana he ditched the craft off grand 
cayman island when he ran out of fuel trying to avoid storms 
toliver who is serving a marijuana smuggling sentence in north 
carolina was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony 
the lawsuit was filed by midland national bank of newton which 
said it had a 198000 lien on the plane 
the defendants included the planes owner walter conlogue who 
said his company american aircraft co of newton leased the 
aircraft to us customs agents to help in an undercover drug 
investigation 
puritan insurance co of stamford conn refused to pay a claim 
on the planes 225000 insurance policy saying conlogue lied 
about the planes use 
conlogue said he was warned that if he did not do so innocent 
people would suffer and be killed 
the insurance company is both a defendant and a plaintiff in the 
lawsuit the government is also a defendant 
fridays hearing was held to determine why the government had 
not paid the settlement negotiated in november the terms of the 
agreement have not been revealed

greyhound said monday it will not resume stalled 
talks with striking drivers until attacks on buses and replacement 
drivers stop but a union leader pledged to meet any time with 
company negotiators 
the first meeting between the two sides broke down sunday when 
dallasbased greyhound accused union leaders of failing to 
negotiate and of stepping up violence walkout now in its third 
week 
a lot of the problem was the continuing intimidation and 
violence said company spokeswoman lyn grayley the company 
just does not feel that they will be intimidated into accepting a 
contract 
maybe if the violence and terrorism and intimidation and all 
that stopped reopening talks would be considered she said 
our main concern at this point is the safety of our passengers 
and employees 
there have been at least 14 shooting attacks on greyhound buses 
46 bomb threats and numerous other incidents of vandalism or 
threats during the 18dayold walkout company officials say 
greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service 
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which 
buses are the only public transportation 
unions representing 6300 drivers and an estimated 3000 other 
greyhound workers walked out march 2 over wages job security and 
grievance procedures 
in denver the amalgamated transit unions vice president jim 
hayes said the union would return to talks any time any 
place but the sticking point is greyhounds unwillingness to 
compromise 
the company hasnt changed a thing he said the company 
makes one cent per mile for every passenger and that comes out to 
about 78 million were asking for 40 million over 3 years 
the bus company last week began a nationwide radio advertising 
campaign to counter allegations by striking drivers that newly 
hired drivers were not properly trained 
weve hired many new permanent drivers who are professionally 
qualified thoroughly trained and committed to giving you the 
quality service youve come to expect from greyhound the radio 
spots say 
ms grayley the company spokeswoman said the new drivers must 
have two years experience driving a bus or truck and are certified 
by the department of transportation 
with so many of the violent episodes that have gone on people 
are nervous she said and we dont want them to feel thats 
going to happen every time a bus goes out on the road we want them 
to know were doing everything in our power to make those buses 
safe she said 
union leaders say they condemned the violence and greyhound is 
the one balking in negotiations 
we have continually called for our members to refrain from 
illegal activity said jeff nelson spokesman for the amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions in washington but we are not 
police 
this is simply an attempt by the companys socalled 
negotiator to stonewall the real issue which is negotiating a 
contract nelson said 
during talks in tucson ariz on saturday the union proposed a 
40 million threeyear package that included pay increases of 4 
percent to 5 percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension 
plan 
but the cost would be three times more than greyhound could 
afford ms grayley said 
a union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that 
included no guaranteed pay raises but would have made raises 
contingent on increased profits and ridership 
negotiations broke off sunday after about an hour but both 
sides later met separately with federal mediators 
i think we made some progress in the meetings said jim 
power spokesman for the federal mediation and conciliation service 
in washington

attorney general dick thornburgh said on 
monday he favors making us aid to other countries conditional on 
their cooperation in curbing drug traffic after they get a chance 
to adopt needed laws 
he pointed to an international pact on cooperation signed by 89 
governments it will take effect when 20 of them have ratified it 
as the united states has already done 
there will come a time when those that have not ratified the 
convention will be questioned by those who have and who continue to 
be concerned about the drug problem he told reporters i would 
not rule out some action in this country at that time to indeed put 
that kind of restriction on us aid 
that would not happen in the foreseeable future he added 
he said that if he had his way he would urge such a course 
after an interval during which countries had the opportunity to 
change their laws he added that the process would take some time 
and that the 89 governments presumably support the goal of 
eradicating the drug traffic and money laundering 
but that time is running and more and more nations are 
ratifying the convention he said 
and particularly when weve reached the point where 20 nations 
have ratified and the convention comes into force then well be 
looking to every nation around the world to do its share in dealing 
with this problem 
thornburgh emphasized the need for international cooperation he 
said there have been calls in congress and the media for us 
intervention but that president bush had chosen a more restrained 
and measured response intervention would ultimately be 
counterproductive he said 
he said the indictment in this country of khun sa the opium war 
lord in burma would step up the pressure on the international 
community and improve the chances of getting hold of him the 
indictment was returned in december by a court in new york and 
disclosed in washington last week 
thornburgh said then that someone in khun sas own forces might 
betray him today he said that he knows there are substantial 
obstacles to an arrest khun sa has an army estimated at 4000 to 
16000 men 
thornburgh predicted that drug money will seek outlets in other 
banking systems as switzerland and other countries tighten their 
cooperation on money laundering 
i expect no nation with a credible banking system to be 
immune he said

broadcasts to north america by radio vilnius 
voice of the lithuanian capital were either jammed or silenced 
monday night according to a frequent listener 
the radio vilnius announcer suggested that the soviet ministry 
of communications was doing the jamming and asked listeners in 
europe to tune to frequencies that are not relayed by radio moscow 
mondays broadcast monitored in washington was barely audible 
beneath a superimposed droning sound a classic jamming 
situation said paul courson amateur radio operator and anchor 
for ap network news 
the shortwave broadcasts to north america normally are made on 
six different frequencies to ensure a good chance of reception in 
all areas of the continent 
the broadcasts are normally relayed by radio moscow on its 
powerful transmitters 
after the declaration of independence by the lithuanian 
parliament on march 5 the englishlanguage broadcasts were heard 
normally last week said courson 
however last night sunday night they were missing 
altogether and monday night were missing from five of the six 
scheduled frequencies courson said 
the sixth frequency 11770 megahertz carried the jammed 
broadcast 
a lithuanianamerican group the lithuanianamerican community 
inc said in arlington va it had received reports that agents 
of the kgb the soviet secret police entered radio and television 
stations in lithuania but had not interfered with operations 
here is the transcript of monday nights english broadcast 
recorded by the ap though the annoucner begins by blaming radio 
moscow for the jamming he later seems to blame the ministry 
by custom in lithuania and the soviet union the announcer is 
not identified 
for many years now radio vilnius external service in 
lithuanian and english languanges has been using the powerful 
system of relay stations in exterior parts of the soviet union 
thanks to these relay stations our broadcasts could be heard 
in more than 50 countries of the world 
besides shortwave frequencies radio vilnius programs in 
lithuanian and english are also broadcast on medium wave through 
relatively weak transmitters located in lithuania their signal 
strength however is sufficient to be heard in northern europe 
west germany and great britain as these transmitters are located 
in lithuania we advise all radio vilnius listeners in europe to 
tune in to these mediumwave broadcasts 
today the leaders of the lithuanian radio and tv networks and 
radio vilnius people have been getting in touch with highlevel or 
ranking officials of radio moscow it appears the blockade of radio 
vilnius broadcasts was a surprise to them and they promised to 
clear up what the matter was 
this suggests that perhaps the blockade of radio vilnius 
broadcasts abroad was not conducted by radio moscow but rather by 
the minister of communications of the ussr but so far no answer 
from that ministry has been received

a federal judge on monday denied a mistrial 
motion by john poindexter that was triggered by a reference in open 
court to testimony poindexter had given congress under a grant of 
immunity 
the information in the reference was not new at all said 
the judge in poindexters irancontra trial 
with rep lee hamilton on the witness stand prosecutor dan webb 
asked about a document signed by thenpresident reagan indicating 
missiles had been sent to iran in 1985 to try to win the release of 
americans held in lebanon 
had poindexter ever reported destroying the document webb asked 
he did hamilton said in front of the jury 
in other testimony hamilton said the late cia director william 
casey denied the very existence of the document in congressional 
testimony a denial that was not true and a denial that had not 
been known before 
the congressman cochairman of a special congressional 
committee that investigated the irancontra affair was referring 
to poindexters july 1987 testimony to the committee during which 
he said he tore up the document 
no part of the case against reagans national security adviser 
may be derived from his testimony to congress given under a grant 
of immunity from prosecution 
as soon as hamilton answered the question on monday another 
prosecutor howard pearl stood up and webb quickly said i see 
the problem 
webb rephrased the question but poindexter lawyer richard 
beckler later asked for a mistrial saying that hamilton had 
specifically been instructed not to refer to poindexters immunized 
testimony 
us district judge harold greene denied the motion saying that 
oliver north testified last week that he watched poindexter tear up 
the finding 
greene said hamiltons testimony was cumulative rather than 
harmful 
beckler suggested the jury might not find norths testimony 
credible but greene also noted that both the government and the 
defense referred to tearing up of the finding in their opening 
statements to the jury 
and you have great credibility greene told beckler 
the information about tearing up the finding is not new at 
all greene concluded 
in november 1986 hamilton had been chairman of the house 
intelligence committee that met with poindexter to discuss us 
arms sales to iran 
the congressman said the national security adviser made no 
mention of a us role in the november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran the ciaassisted delivery was authorized by the 
reagan finding that poindexter destroyed hours after testifying 
before the committee 
casey who prepared the finding for reagan appeared with 
poindexter before the committee 
do you remember casey in that testimony actually telling you 
there was no finding for that 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to 
iran webb asked hamilton 
i do replied hamilton 
webb asked hamilton do you recall whether admiral poindexter 
said he could reveal all the facts 
admiral poindexter said president reagan wanted to tell 
the full story replied hamilton 
the finding that poindexter destroyed depicted the us role in 
iran arms sales as a straight armsforhostages deal the kind of 
arrangement the reagan administration declared it would never allow 
poindexter told the intelligence committee members that the us 
government didnt learn until january 1986 of the missile shipment 
according to notes taken at the meeting by a congressional staffer 
hamilton said poindexter read verbatim a january 1986 
presidential finding that did not portray the iran initiative as a 
straight trade of arms for hostages 
poindexter only told you about the january finding asked 
webb hamilton replied that had been the case 
did john poindexter ever tell the committee that the us 
government had been involved in iran arms shipments before the date 
of this finding asked webb 
no he did not answered hamilton 
john poindexter in the briefing session did he ever tell 
about another presidential finding one that was actually signed by 
the president in 1985 relating to us involvement in another arms 
shipment asked webb 
he did not said hamilton 
earlier hamilton testified that poindexter endorsed false 
answers by his predecessor as national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane which denied that north was supplying the contras with 
military advice or raising money for them 
poindexter sent a letter to hamilton in the summer of 1986 
referring to mcfarlanes denials of the previous year 
i understood that john poindexter was restating the same 
denials we had from mr mcfarlane there was no doubt in my mind 
about that hamilton said 
webb said north testified last week that mcfarlanes answers 
were all false 
hamilton also testified that the system simply doesnt work 
if officials lie to one another 
asked by webb whether john poindexter or oliver north ever 
had a right to lie to congress hamilton replied they did 
not 
does the system work if officials lie to congress asked webb 
the system simply doesnt work if we lie to one another in 
government replied hamilton

israel tv said prime minister yitzhak shamir 
holds the best chance of being tapped to form a new government 
after the ultraorthodox parties split monday over backing his 
rightwing likud bloc or the labor party 
the religious parties hold the key votes on who will lead the 
government 
the spiritual leaders of the ultraorthodox shas or torah 
guardians and torah flag parties held a crucial meeting and 
decided to back shamir israel radio said 
earlier monday leading rabbinical scholars of the small 
ultraorthodox party agudat israel decided to throw their support 
behind shimon peres leftofcenter labor party 
shas leader interior minister aryeh deri indicated monday on 
army radio that shas support for likud was conditional on 
acceptance of proposals of us secretary of state james a baker 
iii for convening israelipalestinian peace talks 
likuds objections to bakers proposals were what brought down 
shamirs government last thursday by a 6055 noconfidence vote in 
the 120seat parliament 
israel tv said mondays decisions by the ultraorthodox parties 
tied likud and labor with 60 seats each it takes 61 to form a 
government 
but the television said president chaim herzog now may well give 
shamir the nod to form a government because he controls the largest 
faction in parliament 
herzog is meeting with political leaders to chose who will form 
the next administration he is expected to invite the shas faction 
to his residence again tuesday for clarification of who they 
support an israeli official said 
shas helped topple the government last thursday it said sunday 
it was backing likud but did not recommend who should lead likud 
in setting up a coalition 
the israeli official who spoke on condition of not being 
identified said herzog could announce his decision by tuesday 
night or early wednesday 
herzog will base his decision on whoever has the best chance of 
forming a coalition government since a tie is reported however 
he could give the mandate to the leader of the largest faction in 
parliament which has been the practice in the past 
peres was initially expected to be herzogs choice but 
complications rose with growing splits and indecision in the 
religious camp over who to favor 
both large parties faced the difficulty of melding extreme 
right or leftwing factions into an uneasy coalition with 
religious groups 
labor is parliaments largest single faction with 39 seats 
likud has 35 but also controls a fiveseat liberal faction that it 
is trying to woo back into its ranks making it the largest party 
transportation minister moshe katzav of likud maintained in 
remarks made on israel tv that likud remains the largest party 
since the liberal breakaways still took part in all likud functions 
rafi edri a former labor minister said on israel tv that labor 
still believes it will be able to win over shas becaause only a 
peresled coalition could advance the peace process 
shas spiritual leader rabbi ovadiah yosef made a rare 
television appearance sunday night and assailed shamirs middle 
east policies saying they invited war and bloodshed upon 
israel 
how would i give an account standing in judgment before the 
creator for the blood spilled without knowing i tried to avoid 
it asked yosef who is also a former chief rabbi of israels 
sephardic community jews of middle east origin 
while its abstention in the thursday vote gave victory to labor 
shas has had a steady alliance with likud since shas was founded in 
1984 
agudat israel a party founded as an antizionist movement in 
eastern europe in the 19th century is traditionally neutral on 
foreign policy it usually backs the party that pledges more 
support for religious institutions 
apprehensions are growing in both labor and likud that a 
prolonged stalemate could force parliament to move up national 
elections now scheduled for 1992 
shamir remains caretaker premier until a new government is 
formed or elections are held israeli law allows a maximum six 
weeks for whichever party leader is chosen to form a new government

the government said monday it is setting up a 
special war crimes unit of police officers to investigate alleged 
world war ii atrocities committed by people now living in britain 
home secretary david waddington said the british police had 
never investigated war crimes before and the unit would work in the 
same way the police investigated any other criminal activities 
he said police legal authorities and the courts would have the 
responsibility for prosecutions trials and convictions and the 
government would not interfere 
waddington made his announcement in the house of commons which 
voted 27360 monday to approve in principal legislation that would 
make prosecutions possible despite the long lapse of time since the 
war ended in 1945 
prime minister margaret thatcher backs the bill which has to go 
through further procedures before it becomes law when the 
legislation was introduced earlier this month government officials 
said the first trial might be held before the end of this year 
it is so long since the war and the instinctive wish of most 
of us is to get on with our lives in peace and not to rake over the 
past let alone the pasts of men who have lived peacefully in this 
country since before some members of parliament were born 
waddington said 
but sometimes one is brought face to face with facts that 
cannot be buried with deeds so terrible that they cannot be 
forgotten and as long as one of those responsible survives the 
world will cry out for justice 
the simon wiesenthal center based in los angeles gave lists of 
suspects to the british government in 1986 during controversy over 
the world war ii role of austrian president kurt waldheim when he 
was a german army officer 
a british inquiry last year exonerated waldheim of complicity in 
the executions of british prisoners of war in the balkans where he 
was serving 
a separate governmentordered inquiry said there was sufficient 
evidence to prosecute three suspects living in britain it also 
urged the investigation of 124 others who came to britain with 
thousands of displaced persons after the war 
british news reports have said all the suspects in britain are 
from the soviet republics of lithuania latvia and ukraine where 
the nazis recruited killer squads and massacred thousands of people 
new war crimes trials are opposed by lord shawcross who as sir 
hartley shawcross was british chief prosecutor at the nuremberg 
trials of leading nazi war criminals 
to raise all these issues and spend an enormous amount of 
money to convict three or four old men and send them to die in a 
prison hospital is counterproductive and not worthwhile he said 
in statement 
shawcross 88 said the trials would revolve around evidence of 
identification which was notoriously unreliable at the best of 
times and even more so after 45 years

the kremlin on monday sternly warned the breakaway 
republic of lithuania not to put up its own customs posts 
introduce its own currency or take over moscowrun factories 
without permission 
the nationally televised announcement was mikhail s gorbachevs 
first concrete step to counter lithuanias march 11 declaration of 
independence the announcement did not say what would happen if 
lithuania ignored the orders 
despite the harsh words lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis said in a statement issued by the republics parliament 
late monday i think this is an introductory stage of 
negotiations 
he added that his government agreed with elements of moscows 
statement including the value of maintaining economic ties between 
lithuania and the soviet union 
earlier monday a lithuanian delegation delivered a letter to 
the kremlin that promised soviet interests in the republic would be 
given careful consideration 
a spokesman for the lithuanian nationalist movement sajudis 
lionginas vasiliauskas said in moscow that 10 truckloads of soviet 
troops were moved monday from kaunas about 60 miles from vilnius 
to a military post just outside the capital 
there have been unconfirmed reports the past several days that 
radio vilnius had been either jammed or replaced with russian 
programs a loud hum could be heard during a broadcast monitored in 
washington monday night 
we have reliable information that in the past few days radio 
vilnius broadcasts to foreign countries have been blocked by radio 
moscow the broadcast said 
it said radio moscow had been informed and that officials there 
seemed surprised this suggests that perhaps the blockade of 
radio vilnius broadcasts abroad was not conducted by radio moscow 
but rather by the minister of communications of the ussr but so 
far no answer from that ministry has been received the 
broadcast said 
the kremlins television statement accused the lithuanian 
leadership of planning to turn over national factories to private 
owners bring in a separate currency and put up customs posts on 
the borders of the republic 
it said the government was concerned especially about nuclear 
energy plants in lithuania and had ordered increased security 
around them 
it accused the baltic republic of trying to undermine its 
links with the rest of the soviet union which it said could have 
pernicious consequences for the national economy 
the government said police the kgb and customs agents would 
have authority in maintaining the existing customs situation 
a directive was issued to the management of all soviet 
enterprises and agencies in lithuania saying under no 
circumstances should they begin negotiations on handing over their 
authority to local officials such talks can only be run by moscow 
ministries it said 
many lithuanians say they expect moscow to impose an economic 
blockade depriving the republic of the fuel and raw materials it 
receives only from the soviet union 
the government statement contained no such threats 
gorbachev and the congress of peoples deputies the national 
parliament declared the declaration of independence invalid last 
week but kremlin leaders have ruled out use of troops in lithuania 
lithuanian activist and television editor eduardas potashinskas 
said he thought most lithuanians would take the government warning 
calmly 
we say the soviet empire is showing its teeth he said by 
telephone from the lithuanian capital vilnius but we think they 
cant threaten lithuania well be calm well fall and get up but 
well go on 
on sunday soviet jets buzzed vilnius in what many lithuanians 
consider an intimidation tactic and maneuvers were carried out in 
the countryside residents said monday the maneuvers appeared over 
a soviet spokesman in moscow said the military maneuvers were 
not extensive and had been planned long in advance 
but landsbergis told lithuanian legislators monday the exercises 
added to tensions with the kremlin 
he said he asked highranking soviet officers sunday if he would 
be notified in advance of future maneuvers one of the officers 
replied that he could not make guarantees 
the bush administration said monday it would keep an eye on 
soviet military activities in the baltics the white house and 
state department spokesmen urged a peaceful approach to secession 
and reminded gorbachev he had said force would not be used 
lithuanias parliament voted overwhelmingly march 13 to secede 
from the soviet union and regain the independence it enjoyed before 
being forcibly annexed by the kremlin in 1940 along with estonia 
and latvia 
the tv statement said the government sympathized with 
lithuanias desire for greater sovereignty but it said this should 
only be pursued together with strict observance of soviet laws 
and taking into consideration the mutual interests of the peoples 
of lithuania and other republics 
soviet tv has broadcast several segments the last two days 
focusing on discontent among nonlithuanians who comprise about 20 
percent of the republics 37 million people 
on monday evening the nightly news program vremya showed a 
mass meeting against lithuanian independence in the city klaipeda 
one speaker complained we dont want to live in bourgeois 
lithuania 
a vremya anchorman also read an appeal from a demonstration 
held sunday in vilnius that drew tens of thousands of lithuanias 
russians poles and other ethnic minorities 
hypocritically and arrogantly the interests of many thousands 
of people who are categorically against being torn from the peoples 
of the ussr are being ignored it said it was addressed to 
gorbachev 
the appeal expressed the hope that gorbachev would be able to 
defend your fellow citizens from the encroachments of political 
adventurists 
gorbachev has said he is willing to carry on a respectful 
dialogue with lithuanian representatives and he reportedly met 
personally with a lithuanian delegation that arrived in moscow 
the sixmember delegation was headed by egidius bickauskas a 
lawyer who recently resigned from the lithuanian communist party 
it was empowered by lithuanias parliament to meet with 
gorbachev and propose a start of negotiations on independence said 
a sajudis spokesman 
delegates from independenceminded estonia were also in moscow 
on monday to discuss independence lawmakers favoring independence 
are expected to dominate estonias new parliament which was 
elected sunday

violence in natal the traditional home of the zulus the zulus 
inkatha movement has been fighting groups allied to the anc for 
dominance in natal 
but buthelezi criticized sisulu for insisting they meet in the 
natal town of nongome instead of the traditional zulu capital of 
ulundi buthelezi said sisulus action was a snub to the zulu 
people and an attempt to belittle their history 
in what way is he contributing to peace if he talks this way 
to our people buthelezi said sisulu had no comment beyond 
saying he hoped the meeting could be held soon

dispute with the city monday over financing of denvers new 23 
billion airport with an agreement calling for a new design to suit 
continentals needs 
the city also agreed to cap perpassenger fees charged 
continental and to build 100 million worth of support facilities 
for the airline which will repay the city through a 30year lease 
agreement 
the airport expected to be second in size only to chicagos 
ohare when it opens in 1993 would be the nations first new major 
airport to be built since 1974 when the dallasfort worth airport 
was completed 
at a news conference to announce the deal denver mayor federico 
pena said the agreement will ensure the partnership of a major 
corporation in the operation of the airport to be located about 15 
miles northeast of denver 
the agreement we signed today ends all the disputes and 
wrangling over the past several months between denver and 
continental airlines pena said 
pena and continental chairman frank lorenzo signed the agreement 
after several days of longdistance conference calls between 
airport planners and continental executives 
the city still is trying to reach a similar agreement with 
denvers other major air carrier united airlines 
the agreement calls for continental to enter a 20year lease 
with denver for 30 gates and 15 commuter plane parking spaces at

seabrook nuclear power plant operators on 
monday began what was considered the first step toward initiating a 
sustained atomic reaction in the plants uranium fuel 
operators began diluting neutronabsorbing boron in the 
reactors primary cooling system setting the stage for withdrawing 
the 57 control rods from the reactor spokesman ron sher said 
withdrawing the control rods which also absorb neutrons would 
raise the number of stray neutrons in the reactor core enough to 
begin a sustained chain reaction of fissioning uranium atoms 
sher said the first fission in the fuel core since lowpower 
testing in mid1989 would follow within tens of minutes with 
the reactor operating at a fraction of 1 percent of full power 
sher said monday afternoon that withdrawing the rods was some 
time away but could come early tuesday he said the timetable 
was difficult to predict because plant personnel also were 
performing final rounds of instrument and equipment checks 
he said its difficult to say precisely when the plant will move 
beyond the system check mode because somebody doesnt say 
okay now were in the startup mode but sher said earlier this 
month that diluting the boron could be considered the first 
physical step toward initiating a chain reaction 
the 65 billion plant finished in mid1986 finally got its 
nuclear regulatory commission operating license on thursday 
following lengthy regulatory battles and a preliminary court 
skirmish decided in seabrooks favor 
the us court of appeals in washington declined last week to 
block the license pending further court action but still must 
consider an appeal filed by the massachusetts attorney general 
seacoast antipollution league and new england coalition on nuclear 
pollution

premier li peng opened the annual legislative 
session on tuesday by proclaiming chinas present political and 
economic policies would continue because only socialism can save 
china 
li in speech of more than two hours to the nearly 3000 
deputies of the national peoples congress also said the state 
would exert more central controls over the economy but would ease 
austerity measures that have brought growth to a standstill 
lis state of the nation address sets the tone of the 15day 
meeting expected to show unwavering support for the partys 
hardline political and economic policies 
li began by noting the soulstirring struggles of 1989 
including the victory over the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the governments term for the studentled prodemocracy movement 
crushed by military force last june 
he said the democracy movement was led by hostile forces trying 
to turn china into a bourgeois republic and a dependency of 
developed capitalist countries 
only socialism can save china li said if china turns 
toward capitalism a polarization of classes would inevitably 
arise the overwhelming majority of people would sink into poverty 
and social unrest would prevail for a long time to come fraud 
degeneration and crime inherent in a society of exploiting 
classes would spread unchecked 
li wearing a western suit was only occasionally applauded as 
he spoke sitting behind him on the podium were about 150 senior 
officials including communist party general secretary jiang zemin 
president yang shangkun and members of the party politburo 
for the second straight year senior leader deng xiaoping did 
not appear at the opening session also missing was zhao ziyang 
the former party chief who was purged from all party posts last 
year after being accused of supporting the democracy movement zhao 
is still a deputy from sichuan province 
on the ideological front li said the influence of bourgeois 
liberalization thinking and repulsive social phenomena still need 
to be done away with 
chinas opendoor policy will continue he said but cautioned 
that china must maintain sharp vigilance and resolutely combat 
the trend of westernstyle democracy with a multiparty system 
on foreign affairs li said china is naturally concerned about 
the drastic political changes that have taken place in eastern 
europe but hopes to maintain normal friendly relations with 
those countries 
he said china hopes for improved relations with the united 
states and the west he criticized western sanctions imposed after 
the tiananmen movement was suppressed and said china never yields 
to external pressure and no one can succeed in isolating 
china

march 12 sent 200 reporters the real thing samples containing 5 
bills 
newsrooms are frequent recipients of promotional items sent from 
companies trying to get publicity but cash from a major 
corporation is unusual 
the magic summer campaign to promote cocacola classic will 
include 750000 randomly distributed cans which appear to be 
regular cans of coke but when opened reveal a mechanism holding up 
to 200 in cash or a certificate for other prizes 
bob bertini a spokesman for cocacola usa said the company 
sent the reporters cans with 5 bills the smallest denomination 
in the campaign merely to demonstrate the promotion 
we sent it to a very small group of national writers the 
reporters cant write about it without seeing it bertini said 
many news organizations have policies against reporters 
receiving gifts of value from news sources 
bertini said the company is urging reporters to donate the money

the minnesota supreme court was asked 
march 13 to decide whether the states two largest daily newspapers 
are liable for damages for publishing the name of a source who was 
promised anonymity by reporters 
attorneys for the st paul pioneer press dispatch and the star 
tribune of minneapolis asked the justices to overturn a hennepin 
county district court jurys 200000 damage award to dan cohen 
an attorney for cohen meanwhile asked the court to reinstate 
the jurys 500000 punitive damage award which was overturned 
last september by the minnesota court of appeals 
the dispute began in 1982 when cohen gave reporters copies of 
court documents showing that marlene johnson who then was seeking 
her first term as lieutenant governor had been convicted of 
shoplifting 12 years earlier 
johnsons conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence she 
was elected as gov rudy perpichs running mate in 1982 reelected 
in 1986 and is running with perpich again this year 
cohen was working for rival gubernatorial candidate wheelock 
whitney when he provided the information about johnson on the 
condition that he not be identified 
reporters gave him that assurance but newspaper editors decided 
to name cohen as the source of the documents editors testified 
that they named cohen because they believed the public had a right 
to know the information came from an independentrepublican 
activist 
cohens lawsuit said he lost his advertising agency job because 
of the resulting publicity 
the court of appeals threw out the lower courts punitive damage 
award but held that the first amendment does not bar a breach of 
contract claim in such circumstances 
attorney john borger representing the minneapolis newspaper 
told the supreme court that first amendment free press 
considerations not contract law should govern the case he said 
the newspapers had to identify cohen 
what the public had to understand was how close to the whitney 
campaign the source of the information was borger said 
the supreme court took the case under advisement and is expected 
to rule in a few months

the supreme court on march 19 refused to hear 
a bush administration appeal aimed at making it costlier for an 
organization called the national security archive to compile 
information 
the archive is a nonprofit organization that collects 
information on national security and foreign policy and makes it 
available to the public in various ways 
it has filed thousands of foia requests for government records 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that gives the 
archive the same preferential status under the freedom of 
information act that other news organizations enjoy 
the administration claimed the archive should not have the 
status of a news organization for purposes of foia requests 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last year that the 
archive should be treated as a news media representative under the 
foia because it publishes some of the information it gathers itself 
news media representatives that make foia requests reimburse the 
government for the cost of copying the documents but not for the 
major additional cost of searching for the records if the archive 
did not have the status of a news organization it would have to 
reimburse the government for search costs 
the archive is headed by scott armstrong a former washington 
post reporter and coauthor of the brethren a 1979 book that 
provided a behindthescenes look at the supreme court 
the organization published a book entitled the chronology the 
documented daybyday account of the secret military assistance to

the japanese love to complain about their public 
broadcasting behemoth nhk and millions have stopped paying the 
fees that keep it on the air 
a lawsuit has been filed against the network because of alleged 
political partisanship by one of its prominent reporters as for 
nonpayment of fees an nhk spokesman said we dont seek 
punishment for those who refuse we just appeal to their honest 
nature 
the 66yearold japan broadcasting corp better known as 
nippon hoso kyokai or nhk is japans only national television 
network monthly fees paid by owners of television sets are 
supposed to cover its operating costs 
nhk has a generalinterest channel and another featuring science 
and cultural programs it is known for conservative programming and 
unsmiling announcers who apologize with deep bows even for minor 
mistakes in subtitles 
no advertisements appear on nhks channels nor does it mention 
brand names the title of a popular song bright red porsche 
was changed on a variety show to bright red car 
such programs as documentaries on the silk road chinas yellow 
river and the human body are acclaimed but viewers say hourslong 
live broadcasts of parliamentary debates are stultifying 
critics also say the network is too close to the governing 
liberal democratic party 
if nhk were an ordinary company the liberal democrats would 
be the majority stockholders media critic masanori atsuta said 
according to themis magazine 
a cabinetappointed committee names nhks chairman and 
parliament approves the budget nhk insists it is independent 
otherwise but investigative reporting that could embarrass the 
government is left to commercial networks 
the network has a staff of 15000 and 93 percent of its budget 
comes from public fees it regularly loses money because of the 
millions who refuse to pay 
daijiro hashimoto an nhk reporter and younger brother of 
finance minister ryutaro hashimoto is at the focus of the 
networks latest woes 
hashimoto the reporter took part in his brothers successful 
campaign for reelection to parliament in february prompting 
allegations that he violated media guidelines of political 
neutrality 
takehiro motohashi spokesman for nhk said the network 
regretted its reporters actions but was not taking 
disciplinary measures 
yokohama lawyer masayoshi hamada was sufficiantly angry to bring 
legal action against the network his suit claims nhk showed 
favoritism by lending its name to a political campaign and thus 
has no claim to user fees 
nhk will not comment on the case but spokesman motohashi made 
the appeal to peoples honest nature after noting that the 
broadcast law requires the 33 million households with television to 
pay the appropriate fees 
fees are 713 a month for a color televisions and 470 for 
blackandwhite sets payable either a year in advance or by 
monthly automatic bank transfers 
despite an income last year of 26 billion nhk ran a deficit 
of 167 million because of such costly new ventures as satellite 
broadcasting highdefinition tv and teletext broadcasting news 
reports say the network wants a 28 percent rate increase 
to mark households that pay their fees nhk puts small stickers 
on front doors one antipayment group sends out free stickers 
saying nhk fee refuser 
i paid until about three years ago said keiko watanabe a 
secretary who likes nhk shows why should i have to pay for nhk 
and not others 
all nhk employees have to take their turn collecting bills to 
impress on us that we survive on public donations an nhk 
reporter said 
salaries are low the reporter who did not want his name 
revealed said there is an inside joke that nhk stands for nippon 
hakkyu kyokai japan lowwage corp 
someone who is paid 32000 a year at nhk would earn 47000 at 
tv asahi a commercial network based in tokyo 
in the countryside everyone feels nhks the best network 
around said a reporter from rival tbs kids there see our tbs 
van and start shouting look its nhk its like god to them 
yuko saito a housewife in rural shizuoka prefecture 125 miles 
southwest of tokyo leaves the set on nhk 
other networks are pretty silly she said my husband 
thinks any news besides nhk is dumb and my mother is glued to nhk 
all day

as she completes a decade in congress 
protecting the environment remains a top priority for rep claudine 
schneider of rhode island an activist who made her name fighting 
against a nuclear power plant in the 1970s 
the rest of congress is catching up as lawmakers rush to 
introduce bills to save the rain forest stop global warming and 
promote energy efficiency 
but schneider still is a step ahead promoting the 
restructuring of us defense forces to provide for what she calls 
american ecosecurity in the face of new environmental threats 
the country must prepare to defend itself against threats posed 
by a growing population in a world with shrinking resources 
schneider says the threats will arise she says as soil erodes 
and deserts creep into oncefertile regions triggering famines 
hungry people cross borders you get regional conflict we 
need rapid deployment forces for deserts and the tropics says 
schneider providing ecosecurity will require a complete 
reassessment of our national defense strategy she says 
schneider a republican has been a staunch environmental 
crusader throughout her career she has introduced legislation on 
such disparate environmental issues as global warming the loss of 
tropical forests the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer 
ocean dumping oil spills and hazardous wastes 
bills she has introduced to ban ocean dumping encourage energy 
efficiency by utilities and set energy standards for home 
appliances have become law 
on march 17 the national wildlife federation gave her its 1989 
national conservation achievement award for legislation 
recognizing her outstanding leadership on a variety of 
conservation and environmental issues 
she now is lobbying the environmental protection agency to 
institute a wasteend fee that would encourage industry to recycle 
its wastes rather than dump them 
we have the technology to recycle 75 percent of our waste 
she says the question is why arent we doing it 
as the nation prepares to celebrate the 20th anniversary of 
earth day on april 22 congress suddenly is brimming with ideas to 
help the environment schneider says 
there are a dozen different approaches she says 
legislators are considering bills to provide for the planting of 
trees in cities encourage energy efficiency direct the world bank 
to promote conservation and double the budget of the united nations 
family planning program 
i think were going to see more environmental programs 
focusing on international assistance she says 
the focus of legislation in the 1990s will shift from 
controlling pollution to preventing it through such measures as 
encouraging energy efficiency she predicts 
pollution prevention pays she says leastcost energy is 
our promise for the future for domestic and foreign policy 
socalled leastcost utility planning encourages utilities 
to choose the most economical alternatives in providing new sources 
of energy it turns out schneider says that improving energy 
efficiency freeing wasted energy for new uses usually is 
cheaper than building new power plants 
at the same time boosting efficiency cuts emissions of carbon 
and sulfur dioxides responsible for global warming and acid rain 
its a winwin situation she says 
schneider developed her ideas on ecosecurity when she was asked 
three weeks ago to speak to a group of new york businessmen on the 
possible uses of the peace dividend arising from defense 
cutbacks as eastwest tensions subside 
i said theres another dynamic we should be thinking of 
eightythree percent of the worlds population growth by 2010 will 
be in china and the the tropics the resource base is limited 
certainly a piece of the national security picture for the future 
must take population into account 
environmental organizations have come to the same realization 
more of the environmental groups are taking on the population 
issue she says 
schneider made her name in her home state in 1973 as the founder 
of the rhode island committee on energy a group that opposed and 
eventually halted construction of a nuclear plant in charlestown 
ri 
from 1973 until 1978 she was founder and executive director of 
the conservation law foundation formed to represent citizens in 
environmental disputes in 1977 she became federal coordinator of 
the rhode island coastal zone management program 
she has traveled to wilderness areas in madagascar and new 
guinea and has penetrated deeper into the amazon than any us 
government official since theodore roosevelt 
the 1990s schneider says will be the decade of information 
transfer the time to get the word out about new energyefficiency 
technology developed in the 1970s and 1980s 
as part of a publicinformation campaign she soon will have her 
capitol hill office outfitted with the latest in energyefficiency 
lighting including compact fluorescent bulbs that screw into 
ordinary incandescent bulb sockets providing just as much light 
using onefourth the energy 
my frustration as a member of the science and technology 
committee for the past 10 years has been to witness the development 
of these technologies and seeing we do not have a good means as a 
government to get the information out she says 
or a means to remove practical roadblocks as she found out when 
she decided to redo her office 
it took three years to get the architect of the capitol to 
approve it she says its a situation again where we have 
the technology and we havent transferred it 
the 1990s are a transfer time she says there are no 
white hats or black hats were all in this environment together

martha crisostomo was sleeping when eight 
men in army uniforms faces hidden by black ski masks broke down 
her front door 
her parents and neighbors helpless watched the men drag her 
into the street and fire three bullets into her head and chest 
miss crisostomo a 22yearold public health nurse was slain in 
september she was the last witness to an army massacre of 29 
peasants at cayara village in may 1988 
eight other people who implicated the army in the massacre were 
killed by soldiers earlier or detained and never seen again 
according to human rights organizations miss crisostomos parents 
and friends told reporters of her murder 
human rights violatons by security forces have increased 
dramatically in the campaign against the sendero luminoso or 
shining path a maoist group that began an insurgency 10 years ago 
in the andes region around this colonial town 
more than 18000 people have died in political violence since 
1980 most have been indian peasants in the andes killed either by 
rebels who accused them of betraying the struggle or by members of 
the security forces who suspected them of sympathizing with 
guerrillas 
the death of martha crisostomo is concrete proof of the 
outrageous way in which protection has been given to those 
responsible for killing 29 peasants in cayara said carlos 
escobar a former civilian prosecutor whose assignment was to 
investigate human rights violations in the ayacucho region 
he was fired by the attorney generals office when he 
recommended the ayacucho military commander and other officers be 
prosecuted for murder in the cayara massacre escobar also received 
anonymous death threats 
shining path guerrillas have extended their operations beyond 
the andes even into lima and human rights monitors say the 
government has begun to tolerate brutal military tactics in a 
desperate effort to check the insurgency 
they say torture rape disappearance of suspects and murder of 
unarmed civilians have become trademarks of army tactics 
sen javier valle riestra a member of the governing aprista 
party who is a leading defender of human rights said the military 
establishment feels the death of innocent people is a price peru 
must pay to eradicate leftist terrorism 
if 60 people are killed and 40 of them turn out to be 
senderistas the military considers it a successful operation he 
said 
in two detailed reports late last year the human rights 
organization amnesty international said a pall of terror had 
settled over much of peru because of rebel atrocities and brutal 
actions by government forces 
president alan garcia and his civilian aides ignored the amnesty 
reports 
the army routinely refuses comment on accusations of human 
rights violations such as the murders of cayara witnesses after 
the amnesty international reports however the defense ministry 
denied any similarity between army conduct and the shining paths 
demented acts and criminal methods 
for three years the united nations has listed peru as leading 
the world in numbers of disappeared people ahead even of 
militaryruled countries 
in the seven years since civilian governments began putting the 
military in charge of insurgency zones in the andes and the eastern 
jungles more than 3000 people have disappeared after detention 
most human rights violations occur in militarycontrolled 
regions which have expanded to cover onethird of the country 
spanishspeaking soldiers from the coast wearing black ski 
masks patrol the cold andean heights and sweep into remote hamlets 
of quechuaspeaking indian peasants in search of rebels and 
sympathizers 
community leaders say villagers dread the soldiers arrival even 
more than the nocturnal visits of rebel columns 
witnesses to the cayara massacre told civilian investigators the 
soldiers first stomped cactus on the bare backs of villagers 
demanding they identify rebel supporters then killed them by 
bashing their heads in with hammers or slashing their throats with 
machetes 
an army patrol slaughtered 69 peasants in accomarca village in 
1985 including 21 children under age 5 the second lieutenant in 
command told congressional investigators children by the age 3 
were potential senderistas and it was his job to exterminate 
them said se head of the commission 
the army said the officer would be given a private military 
trial reporters discovered later he was promoted to first 
lieutenan valle riestrant and transferred to an army base in lima on 
the coast 
235 miles to the northwest 
human rights officials say brutal repression by security forces 
plays into the hands of the shining path 
the torture the disappearances the illegal executions all 
reinforce the shining paths argument that this is an abusive 
fascist genocidal state diego garciasayan director of the 
independent andean commission of jurists said in an interview 
lima newspapers n public outrage enrique bernales head of a 
senate commission on violence said of martha crisostomos murder 
are we no longer shocked by death he said peru is 
definitely a sick country

a visit with a college roommates sister in 
houston opened director thomas carters eyes about criminal 
prosecutors and led to the creation of abcs equal justice 
she was a very unlikely assistant district attorney who at 26 
or 27 was prosecuting felons said carter who has made a career 
of directing pilots for such series as miami vice st 
elsewhere a year in the life midnight caller and many 
more 
when i looked into it i found the das office was a place 
where very young lawyers got experience he said weve always 
had this image in movies and television of prosecutors being tough 
older and male i learned young lawyers spend six or seven years as 
prosecutors then move on the salaries are low the work is 
intense the burnout rate is high 
these people have such an overwhelming caseload that people 
fall through the cracks our show is about the cracks carter 
said of equal justice 
carter who began directing while starring in the white 
shadow set the unique visual style for miami vice he was 
much in demand as a director but like a hired gunslinger always 
moved on after the pilot 
he was looking for a series of his own and found it in equal 
justice which debuts tuesday march 27 with a twohour pilot 
carter is the cocreator executive producer and director and 
also played a small role in the movie the series will be seen 
beginning wednesday march 28 taking over the time slot of china 
beach which moves to mondays 
equal justice set in a bigcity district attorneys office 
stars cotter smith joe morton jane kaczmarek sarah jessica 
parker barry miller debrah farentino lise cutter james wilder 
george dicenzo and kathleen lloyd carters cocreators were 
christopher knopf and david a simons 
carter is in the forefront of a cadre of young directors who are 
black such as kevin hooks and eric laneuville who got their start 
acting in series 
race may be a problem for other people but i dont let it 
hold me back he said i dont look upon myself as a black 
director im a director being a director is very personal 
because you take with you your life and your experiences and your 
views and being africanamerican is an aspect of my character but 
its not the sum of my life 
im interested in so many things that are universal how the 
death of a person affects someone else love and relationships i 
want to explore a variety of themes as well as a variety of visual 
styles i think if you could sum up my work at all you could say 
it has a sense of romantic realism 
in the beginning carter knew he wanted to do a gritty urban 
show about the criminal justice system he wanted it to have an 
edge be fastpaced and have a mixture of humor and dark tragedy 
he returned to houston for more research then to new york 
where he visited all the boroughs and to chicago he also talked 
to some prosecutors in los angeles although he wanted the story 
set in an older city the pilot movie was filmed in pittsburgh 
in our show we dont deal just with the nuts and bolts of the 
law but with the politics of it as well said carter i wanted 
to do a show that would cause the american public never to look at 
the law the same again 
carter grew up in texas where he studied theater at southwest 
texas state university 
one of his first roles was as ray gun in szysznyk which 
disappeared before anyone learned how to pronounce it 
next came the white shadow where he got his chance to 
direct he found it more challenging than acting and began to 
direct many episodes of hill street blues and st elsewhere 
i was surprised when i directed because i didnt think i 
would like it he said i came here to act i thought if i 
directed at all it would be much later

prostitutes have have taken up health 
education teaching customers how to protect themselves from 
catching and spreading aids 
under an international program that began last year in this 
islamic nation more than 1000 prostitutes in bamako the capital 
have been receiving free condoms and information to pass along on 
the job 
about 350000 africans are believed to be infected with the hiv 
virus most cases are in east and central africa where one in four 
hospital beds is filled with a victim of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome for which no cure is known 
health officials hope to slow the spread of aids in mali and 
other west african countries before it reaches the same 
catastrophic proportions 
we have tried to go to countries where hiv prevalence is very 
low and you get your programs in place early said dr arlene 
mckay of family health international based in north carolina 
you try to avoid the situation you find in some countries 
where up to 20 percent of the pregnant women in prenatal clinics 
are suffering the disease 
her nonprofit biomedical research and technical assistance 
organization is working with risk groups in nine african countries 
under a contract with the us agency for international development 
you need to get in early and reach the people who are most 
likely to be practicing highrisk sex she said 
it is not easy 
officially prostitutes dont exist in mali said dr sidi 
konore coordinator of the national aids prevention and treatment 
program 
the number of people infected with aids is growing and it is 
clear something must be done despite political reluctance he 
said 
once a week a female social worker visits four of bamakos 
largest brothels to distribute condoms provide basic information 
on sexually transmitted diseases and encourage women to take part 
the program has grown significantly since it began with 140 
prostitutes only 11 of whom said they used condoms frequently 
with their clients after three months condom use was up to 90 
percent among the 82 women who continued to participate 
their brothels also benefited by gaining a reputation for safety 
mary bobbey 36 went to work at a low mudbrick house in the 
ramshackle koura district after her husband left and took their 
children her mother got sick and the money ran out 
she works in a small room with a dirt floor and corrugated tin 
door and said she may have 20 customers on a busy day 
not all of them want to use condoms said mrs bobbey who 
earns about 46 on a good day its very dangerous out of 20 
maybe five will refuse and if one refuses i cant argue 
she and other prostitutes are banding together driven by 
sisterhood and common sense 
aminata diakita feeding her children under a palm tree in the 
center courtyard said the the women had decided everyone in the 
house must participate 
if there is a woman here who is not participating and she gets 
sick then the next day the guy will sleep with one of us and well 
be sick said ms diakita chosen by the program as the team 
leader to help organize the house 
besides if a man says he doesnt want to use one and 
threatens to go next door then we can say ok but youll have to 
use one there too 
no one knows how many prostitutes in mali are infected with 
aids which destroys the immune system and leaves the body 
vulnerable to fatal disease figures on aids and other sexually 
transmitted diseases are not released by the government 
the original idea was to see if prostitutes would change their 
behavior and the answer seems to be yes said kathy jesencky of 
family health international 
clients are starting to accept the idea were now going to 
start working with bar girls and women not in houses she said 
using condoms is a habit one develops the awareness is important 
and in mali awareness is increasing

again an anniversary terry andersons fifth 
as a captive again a cycle of hopeful signs and statements about 
the american hostages in lebanon 
but optimism has proved hollow too often to come easily to the 
families colleagues and friends of anderson and the other seven 
americans held captive by militant moslem factions 
always before cycles of hope have yielded to cycles of 
frustration and silence this time perhaps it will be different 
peggy say andersons sister thinks so she is she says 
absolutely convinced that the ceremony held last friday across the 
street from the white house will be the last before anderson and 
other captives finally are freed 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was seized by moslem gunmen on march 16 1985 he has been 
held longer than any other hostage his kidnappers identified 
themselves as members of a group called islamic jihad or holy war 
they are aligned with iran and two hostages who had been held with 
anderson were released after secret reagan administration arms 
shipments to the iranians 
the scandal over the arms sales and diversion of the proceeds to 
support contra rebels in nicaragua made the hostage situation part 
of the major political embarrassment of the reagan years president 
reagan had after all defeated a democratic president undercut by 
the iranian hostage crisis and had promised that he would not let 
americans be taken without swift and sure retribution 
there was no way to make good on that when shiite moslem 
factions began seizing american and other foreign hostages amid the 
unrelenting chaos in beirut all told there are now 18 foreign 
hostages in lebanon 
as he took office bush urged the iranians to help gain freedom 
for the hostages saying that goodwill would beget goodwill 
at milestones along the way anniversaries birthdays the 
release of other hostages the bush inauguration to succeed reagan 
the death of irans ayatollah khomeini there have been cycles of 
heightened public interest of speculation and sometimes of 
optimism about the release of hostages 
in the latest round which began about a month ago a leading 
moslem cleric in beirut said that a way should be found to free the 
hostages and iranian president hashemi rafsanjani was said to have 
declared that he would like the captives released 
but the moslem leader had said much the same thing more than a 
year ago near the fourth anniversary of andersons kidnapping 
rafsanjani as speaker of the iranian parliament had offered in 
1989 to help gain freedom for the hostages if the united states 
would work to free iranians believed to have been captured by 
lebanese christians 
but there have been changes along with those similarities 
president bush has put the hostage issue on the administrations 
public agenda in a way the reagan white house would not especially 
after the irancontra scandal broke 
he spent a half hour with mrs say and her husband david on 
friday bush policy does not break with the course set in the 
reagan years but his handling of the problem certainly does 
i intend to keep open lines of communications with all 
parties including iran who have influence over hostage takers 
bush said in a letter to mrs say please be assured that your 
government will take advantage of all legitimate opportunities to 
obtain the safe release of all of our hostages 
bush also said he had been in touch with syrian president hafez 
assad regarding the hostages his spokesman said later that was 
through diplomatic channels and that there have been other 
overtures to middle eastern leaders on the hostage situation 
jimmy carter met with assad last week and bush said he had 
received reports from the former president carter said in damascus 
that assad told him syria was seeking to convince the captors the 
hostages should be protected and released 
carter said in damascus on friday that he thinks there is a 
better chance of andersons release than ever before he said that 
stems in part from a growing desire on the part of iran and the 
united states to settle their differences 
for all the differences in this cycle of hope there are 
similarities to those that went before there are more contacts 
and changing circumstances but there is nothing firm only an 
atmosphere and conjecture 
bush said that he had been confused by all the speculation about 
a possible break in the hostage situation we are going down 
every alley we are trying every avenue to free the hostages but 
there is no negotiation going on he said

rats run free broken timbers stab out 
of the darkness and men stand in mud breathing bad air stripped 
to the waist thats how it is in a ukrainian coal mine 1500 feet 
below ground 
the men of the trudovskaya mine say life on the surface isnt 
much better their shoddy housing has no running water and the 
stores have little to sell 
many die early killed by accidents cancer or blacklung 
disease they retire at 50 if they live that long 
thousands of miners in the ukraine and in the siberian coal 
fields of the east shocked mikhail s gorbachevs kremlin and the 
economy last summer with the first industrywide strike 
eight months and countless promises later the original 
breadandbutter demands have become political 
after a month of rallies and hunger strikes against the local 
communist party leadership ukrainian miners handed the party a 
stunning setback in elections march 4 
look how i live said nikolai golik 36 who has two 
children our conditions are not much better than down here in 
the pit there is no gas no hot water we aint got a damn indoor 
toilet 
sergei malchenko 26 shares his comrades bitterness 
gorbachev is showing off he said he is not doing 
anything i didnt go vote because i dont want to play those 
games nothing good will come of it for 72 years communists have 
been pulling our legs and finally have mucked it all up i wont 
help them not me 
the trudovskaya mine is one of 21 in this eastern ukrainian city 
of 12 million people in it 3500 miners work sixhour shifts 
around the clock to meet a yearly quota of almost 15 million tons 
of hard coal 
andrei slivka of the donetsk strike committee said working 
conditions have barely changed in his 19 years underground 
in the shaft sections of wall show signs of caving in broken 
timbers protrude in all directions muddy water is underfoot 
everywhere 
poorquality wood brought in to prop up the shafts breaks 
easily hastily built scaffolding often is flooded and slippery so 
miners must jump from board to board 
rats lurk in the flickering light of miners lamps waiting for 
a chance to snatch leftovers from lunch 
on the surface the temperature is 41 degrees fahrenheit in the 
shaft it is 77 degrees 
men dig with shovels drills and picks they crouch squat 
crawl to scoop up coal in a narrow tunnel too low for a them to 
stand straight 
sweat pours down their faces in black streams 
there is an alarm system to warn of explosive gas but miners 
suspect it doesnt work an explosion at the pochenkov mine in same 
coal basin killed 13 miners and injured more than 20 
boris grebenyuk who visited the united states in january with 
several other soviet miners said it would be much easier to work 
there than in a donetsk mine 
we saw humane treatment and a real concern for the workers 
he said after visiting a mine in west virginia 
few statistics are available on accidents and occupational 
illnesses in the nations largest coal field known as the donbass 
yevgeny mironov the acting regional communist party leader 
acknowledged the accident rate was unfortunately rather high 
he blamed shortcomings in working conditions in the 55 miles 
of underground tunnels and carelessness by miners about safety 
rules 
miners who stopped to talk blamed their problems on the 
communist party apparatus 
donetsk is better off in some ways than many soviet cities even 
though sugar is rationed the stores have no cheese or fresh meat 
and fruit is rare in winter the men sometimes are given meat at 
the mine and milk and yogurt are plentiful 
vodka also is plentiful but there are few clothes television 
sets refrigerators or cars for sale 
most workers live in onestory duplexes built in the 1940s and 
1950s that need constant repair and have no modern conveniences 
as in much of the soviet union there are not enough new apartment 
buildings and the waiting lists for better housing are long 
sergei stolika 62 continues working 12 years beyond the 
retirement age because he cant get by on a monthly pension of 170 
rubles 
nikolai tsuprik 27 earns 550 rubles a month more than twice 
the pay of the average soviet worker but asks what can i do 
with them theres nothing to buy in the shops 
vladimir burdo 50 said i have two daughters one of them is 
married and has a child we all live together in a 48squaremeter 
flat you call that life we need new people in the regional party 
committee the size of the apartment is equivalent to 500 square 
feet 
the communist party district leader nikolai nikandrov got only 
about 3000 votes or 34 percent in the ukrainian legislative 
elections march 4 two miner candidates got the most votes for the 
seat 
another loser was vladimir ivantsov party leader at the mine 
who supported the mens demands and appeared to have their respect 
im not sorry i lost the elections ivantsov said people 
didnt vote against me but against the apparatus the system that 
keeps it afloat 
workers want more say in management and greater autonomy for the 
mines 
we cant set wholesale prices as we wish ivantsov said 
we cant decide ourselves where to sell our production we cant 
buy what we really need even for production development 
such problems in the mines make the social problems on the 
surface all the worse he said 
when miners held rallies and demonstrations to force the 
regional party leadership out ivantsov supported them but stopped 
short of endorsing a strike 
mironov the acting regional party leader said he felt 
victimized by the mistakes of those who went before him 
voters dont want to understand we are quite different from 
previous party leaders he said but it is our lot to be called 
to account for the mistakes made before us he rejected demands 
for his resignation 
yuri makharov of the city strike committee said he was in no 
mood for compromise 
they must resign he said not because they are personally 
responsible but because they are part of the system and we are 
out to crush that system

down here at the bottom of americas 
statistics the burning issue is no longer race 
in an evolution as long coming as a magnolia spring the state 
has reckoned that the three rs of the schoolhouse not the fourth 
r of racism are the key to its future the alternative is 
chronic third worldism 
in this climate of introspection jim crow isnt dead just 
irrelevant 
the cost of the states stubborn sometimes bloody past when 
race darkened almost any aspect of public policy or private 
attitudes is embarrassingly high the highest illiteracy rate a 
third of its adults in the nation the highest school dropout 
rate the lowest score on military entrance tests 
thirty percent of mississippis high school graduates dont test 
high enough to qualify for public college in 198589 less than 
half of the college freshmen graduated 
im tired of hearing mississippi this mississippi that 
says marjorie vaughan feisty superintendent of yazoo county 
schools im tired of hearing that word bottom we have 
problems but were all working on them both races 
margie vaughan is right 
in a state where james meredith was shot 24 years ago trying to 
enroll at ole miss 65 percent of the slim public purse is now 
spent on education integrated education the legislature is 
currently scratching its head over how to raise 382 million to 
finance a threeyear education reform package proposed by gov ray 
mabus a 41yearold native back home from harvard law school and a 
washington legal firm 
this is a legislature that traditionally thinks slow and 
thinks small says ole miss history professor david sansing but 
the saliva test for public office in mississippi today is where you 
stand on schooling not segregation 
mabus hoped to pay for a third of his program with a state 
lottery which would have been the first in the south the senate 
wouldnt play hl mencken after all coined the term bible belt 
and said the mississippi state capital at jackson was the 
buckle 
the defeat of the lottery creates a state of uncertainty for 
the whole program said a high state official who would discuss 
the issue only if granted anonymity the public is ahead of the 
legislature on this more than 60 percent favored the lottery in 
polls despite church opposition but politicians are amazingly 
good listeners 
the rest of mabuss best program better education for success 
tomorrow would teach adult literacy go into homes to teach 
parents and preschoolers rudimentary techniques of knowledge 
equalize perpupil expenditures between poor and rich school 
districts free teachers and schools from rote manuals to instruct 
in accord with local needs reward successful schools with bonus 
money to spend as they see fit except for athletics 
best is an allout drive for school betterment all the more 
remarkable for a state that didnt used to have compulsory 
education so as to keep whites from having to go to school with 
blacks 
the impetus for reform is simple economics to be ignorant in a 
computer world is to be eyeless in gaza 
at every level of planning for our future higher employment 
higher standards the basic need was always education says olon 
ray mabus special assistant for education and a former teacher 
our chance for improvement in the state in the united states 
lies in our human capital 
more than a tenth of americans cant read or write says the 
us census lack of a high school educated work force costs the 
nation an estimated 225 billion yearly 
mabus aims to cut the dropout rate twice the nations average 
in half by the year 2001 and reduce illiteracy by 90 percent a 
sobering fact is that threequarters of mississippis projected 
work force in 2001 is already beyond school age 
theyre all were going to get and we need more brains than 
brawn says mike zitterman manager for fritolays mississippi 
operation as a result fritolay has donated a semitruck equipped 
with 10 computers to travel the state teaching basic skills to 
adults 
for a change mississippi has a first in the nation a 25 
percent tax credit for corporations that teach adult education 
packard electric in clinton is spending 300000 a year to teach 
its workers there are almost 50 adult literacy programs in the 
state with 40000 enrollees says judy lipscomb director of the 
governors office for literacy 
mabus is impaled on the horns of a selfmade dilemma he says he 
takes a dim view of raising taxes to pay for his ambitious 
best his predecessor william winter bit a similar bullet 
among the memorabilila and diplomas on the wall of winters 
jackson law office is a painting of a oneroom country school i 
was the only student from that school ever to graduate from high 
school he says winters mother was the teacher more than 
cat she taught her son a respect for education 
in 1952 one in four whites in mississippi finished high 
school one in 40 blacks did he says 
to change this dismal record winter ran for governor in 1967 on 
an education reform platform and lost ditto in 1975 he ran a 
third time in 1979 and won

his reform package was finally passed in 1982 and paid for 
with the largest tax increase in mississippi history while the 
nation was suffering the worst recession since the depression 
education had developed a substantial constituency winter 
says 
kindergarten was made mandatory teacher salaries were raised to 
the regional average compulsory school attendance was given teeth 
mrs winters son had changed the terms of political dialogue in 
mississippi 
first mississippi was a frontier then before the civil war a 
besieged slave society says dr charles wilson a professor of 
southern culture at the university of mississippi in oxford also 
home of william faulkner both societies looked askance at 
education 
nat turners rebellion he could read in 1831 was used as a 
horrible example teaching slaves became illegal after the war the 
politically powerful wanted to keep taxes low why waste money on 
inferiors landlords didnt want sharecroppers reading the fine 
print at the company store let em grow cotton 
the paradox of an illeducated state producing faulkners and 
eudora weltys and richard wrights arises from the oral traditions 
of both the english yeomen and their african slaves wilson 
explains the traditions and histories of both people were handed 
down by storytellers but that is not book learning 
then in the 1980s there was some kind of transformation in 
mississippi a consensus that the state was part of the united 
states even the world economic growth became agreed on as much as 
race used to be all the debate now is how to fund education not 
if 
but expiation for centuries of neglect is daunting illiteracy 
produces a sense of powerlessness says wilson it feeds a 
sense of fatalism theres a certain security in the status quo 
however narrow it may be 
a third of mississippi adults cant help their children with 
their homework read a pill label when they are sick get their 
cars fixed on a credit card so it stays in the garage for weeks 
illiteracy means standing in line for government forms going 
home to get them read then going back to stand in line again it 
means eating potatoes instead of better foods because their prices 
are always changing in the supermarket all those meaningless 
numbers toward the end it means no solace from the bible you cant 
read eyeless in gaza 
to dr merre dorman in starkville the problem and the answer 
begins almost at birth in the home after considerable 
armwrestling she won grants to begin an outreach program for 
children 1 to 7 years old children deemed at risk of 
eventually dropping out of school are identified from welfare rolls 
and the like dormans paid staff visits the homes weekly to hel 
the mothers with nutrition at the stove and nutrition of the mind 
of her children one of dormans staff emma mays is testing two 
of the children of karen isaacs who is barely in her 20s can 
lemarcus 4 catch a ball differentiate textures later mrs mays 
will get basic textbooks to teach karen and lemarcus habits of 
basic intelligence 
lemarcus a brightlooking child doesnt know hes at risk 
merre dorman did and did something about it just talking to ptas 
is like preaching to the choir she says 
there are countless numbers of such local experiments under way 
in mississippi some financed by foundations some with computers 
donated by private corporations 
judy lipscomb overheard two janitors talking at the university 
of southern mississippi in hattiesburg about the computer software 
program they were using in their adult literacy course two 
hundred and seventy employees at the school have been identified as 
illiterate 
how many janitors do you hear talking about software 
gradually we are taking the stigma out of illiteracy 
it takes four years on average to teach an adult to read and 
write same as for a child 
since winters 1982 reform test scores of mississippis 500000 
schoolchildren have risen noticeably if slightly an additional 
50000 remain in the private academies that sprouted when 
integration became mandatory in 1971 
there are any number of educators in place like margie vaughan 
you cant teach with leaking roofs and trash cans in the halls 
that need dumping im on probation because my teacherpupil ratio 
is too high i could fix it tomorrow if i had money thats all it 
takes money 
i tell my teachers dont talk to me about a childs 
background that child is coming to you with nothing give him 
something 
behind margie vaughans desk is a stitched sampler if you can 
read this thank a teacher one of her kids did once named a 
horse for her she laughs we shall overcome 
coming from a white superintendent that rallying call of the 
souths blacks did not seem out of place in the context of 
mississippis school reform education has always been the silver 
bullet that could kill bigotry

george esper who wrote the following story 
spent 10 years covering the vietnam war for the associated press 
and was there when south vietnam fell to the communist north on 
april 30 1975 he has returned to vietnam twice in 1984 and 1989 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on the killing fields of vietnam residue of the 10year war has 
been mostly bulldozed away except for an occasional spent shell or 
a rusted mess kit stuck in the red dirt 
but back home in america a spate of new books and films has 
kept memories of the divisive war very much alive 
like the men they portray books about the vietnam war fiction 
or nonfiction had a tough time being accepted after saigon fell 
to the communists now 15 years later they pour from the presses by 
the hundreds 
through them a new generation relives the horrors of the battles 
at places like the rock pile dak to hamburger hill khe sanh and 
nui lon mountain 
it was on april 30 1975 that south vietnam fell ending a war 
in which nearly 3 million americans fought and 58000 died 
in the late 1970s an older generation of awardwinning books 
about vietnam came along they included michael herrs 
dispatches tim obriens going after cacciato robert 
stones dog soldiers and philip caputos a rumor of war 
which like some others was initially rejected before being 
published in 1977 
but it wasnt until the 1980s that vietnam became a popular 
subject for books and movies the dedication of the vietnam 
memorial in washington brought a new respectability to veterans 
and a new look at the war 
tom hebert a veteran who runs the mailorder vietnam bookstore 
from his home in burlington conn estimates more than 500 books 
about the vietnam war have been published since 1982 his best 
sellers from the 80s include john delvecchios the 13th 
valley robert masons chickenhawk and neil sheehans a 
bright shining lie john paul vann and america in vietnam 
the passing of time also has brought a breakthrough in movies 
after 10 years of trying a twicewounded vietnam veteran 
oliver stone brought to the screen platoon the 1987 academy 
awardwinning movie that is a semiautobiographical account of his 
tour 
born on the fourth of july based on paraplegic ron kovics 
1976 autobiography of patriotism anger guilt and disillusionment 
in the aftermath of war was nominated for eight academy awards 
this year 
the experience of war is still inherently so mysterious and 
fascinating that we just cant seem to examine enough of it says 
michael norman a radioman who wrote these good men one of a 
recent outpouring of powerful personal accounts of the savagery of 
the war and a search for its meaning 
for the men who fought who want to turn war into art you got 
to let some time pass says norman wordsworth was right art 
is emotion recollected in tranquillity you cant be tranquil about 
the war until you let a decent amount of time pass and you think 
about it 
norman traced the lives of 11 comrades with whom he had survived 
the brutal obscene war in an odyssey that took him 50000 
miles in search of what it all meant and what they had become 
the realization came to him 16 years later that these men acted 
at their very best even though he feels sending them to vietnam in 
the cause of democracy turned out to be a lie 
there is no sense to vietnam when one is sober rod kane 
writes in veteranss day another recent book his service as a 
medic was like being on a car that was out of control he says 
after a while vietnam was out of control watching his friends die 
turned kane into a drunk until he sobered up eight years ago 
the new books are filled with metaphors of the senselessness of 
the war of american blood spilled in assaults against meaningless 
hills and mountaintops of no strategic value 
news correspondents who were there recall hills like 875 and 
1338 that towered thousands of feet above the dak to valley and 
claimed 1300 american soldiers scores of wounded had lain on the 
hillside for more than two days in great pain before a relief 
column broke through to rescue them 
i have always preached a lot about hell but i had never seen 
it until the last three days the brigade chaplain was moved to 
say 
many of the american paratroopers at hamburger hill had a 
premonition they were going to die but they were unable to do 
anything about it for eight days the paratroopers assaulted the 
hill at the cost of 46 men killed and 300 wounded

at khe sanh the north vietnamese artillery bombardments reached 
more than 1000 rounds on some days american marines were at their 
very best under the worst conditions dragging bleeding comrades 
toward bunkers pleading corpsman corpsman weve got wounded 
here withstanding a 77day siege that inflicted nearly 2000 
casualties onethird of the entire garrison in the end they 
abandoned it 
jacque navarra rhoads who coedited the book nurses in 
vietnam the forgotten veterans at age 22 had come straight from 
nursing school in albion ny to tend to the shattered bodies in 
the monsoons and mud 
its really depressing because of the amputations she would 
say what a waste of men if i knew what we were fighting for if 
the enemy did something to our country i could see it i dont 
know why were here so many gis ask why i cant answer i came 
because they needed medical help i wanted to appreciate things 
better back home like clean sheets running water and a happy 
family 
another nurse edith knox was so repelled by the sight of four 
casualties with amputated legs the first time she made her rounds 
that she had to leave the emergency room i had never seen 
anything quite like that she would say 
but the most difficult part of her tour was when a youngster 
would ask her how do i write and tell my wife i dont have a leg 
anymore 
nurse sharon lanes medical battalion treated 10000 patients in 
nine months she was so proud of that milestone that she wrote home 
about it four days later a piece of steel from a north vietnamese 
rocket tore through her aorta she bled to death less than a month 
before her 26th birthday the first of eight women killed by 
hostile fire in vietnam 
like many veterans rod kane felt lonely and out of place a war 
that no one wanted turned him into an outcast a man who felt he 
had nothing to offer and was unworthy of returning to society 
some veterans were proud to serve in vietnam at least early on 
disillusionment set in during the late 1960s and early 1970s 
in 1961 tom davis wrote his father i just hope that our 
little bit will help to ease things in this part of the world i 
dont feel too badly about having to be here when i think of all 
the potential good it will have for this country 
three days before his first christmas away from his wife and 
13monthold daughter in tennessee a viet cong bullet ripped 
through his head he was the first american to die in combat in 
vietnam 
but as the decade of the 60s neared an end no one wanted to be 
the last to die in vietnam certainly not the men of a company 
of the 196th light infantry brigades 3rd battalion for five days 
in august 1969 a company had tried to push the north 
vietnamese off nui lon mountain only to be driven back finally 
the men balked 
i am sorry sir but my men refused to go we cannot move 
out the company commander radioed headquarters 
repeat that please have you told them what it means to 
disobey orders under fire asked the battalion commander 
i think they understood the company commander replied 
but some of them simply had enough they are broken there are 
boys here who have only 90 days left in vietnam they want to go 
home in once piece 
harry g summers jr editor of vietnam magazine author of the 
book on strategy and twice decorated for valor says there is 
a very strong statement of patriotism in most of the literature he 
has seen not happy about the way it all ended but certainly 
proud that theyd served their country and i think that represents 
the true feeling of most vietnam vets 
michael norman says war puts a lie to the notion that men fight 
for a flag and they fight for their country they fight to stand 
by the man on their right or left the people that theyre close to 
at the moment and they fight to survive

john silbers 95yearold mother once told him 
son your tongue will be your ruin as he seeks the democratic 
nomination for governor of massachusetts the outspoken president 
of boston university has begun to heed those words still this 
transplanted texan is not one to shy away from a fight 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
john silbers most distinctive feature is not his 
deformed right arm a stump he learned to use as a weapon in 
schoolyard scraps 
what is most physically striking are the furrows that crease his 
face especially when he argues and those furrows are likely to 
deepen in the coming weeks as this kant scholar who whipped boston 
university into shape goes after the democratic nomination for 
governor of massachusetts 
the 63yearold philosopherturnedpolitician a wiry man who 
stands just 5feet7 will take on anyone in an argument 
i love it i love it its a sport he says seated in his 
spartan campaign office furnished with rented green leather 
couches his blue eyes framed by a full head of brown hair its 
a participation sport some people like fencing and i like 
arguing obviously i like arguing 
a transplanted texan now serving as president of boston 
university silber is the squeaky wheel in a fourway race for the 
job a politically weary gov michael dukakis no longer wants 
his competitors at the democratic party convention june 12 are 
the lieutenant governor a former state attorney general and a 
state lawmaker 
in his native texas they would call john silber a maverick 
argumentative as a child combative as a scholar and daring as a 
university administrator he is kicking up a duststorm of 
controversy 
first he complained about the states welfare largess and 
cambodian immigrants in a way some people thought smacked of 
racism then he shared his views on alcoholism in a way critics 
said trivialized the problem and he raised hackles when he called 
jews racist during an interview in which he recalled his attraction 
to judaism as a 21yearold divinity student at yale 
silber says he considered converting but decided not to when he 
discovered the racism of jews is quite phenomenal in treating 
converts as secondclass it was more than 10 years later 
after his father died that silber learned his father was jewish 
silber fought back against the critics he said he was 
misquoted misunderstood and a victim of media distortion he 
pointed out his unwavering support for minorities and israel 
but if some in reserved new england call silber a provocative 
outsider thats the way he likes it 
he thinks voters like it too and that the confrontational 
style he was weaned on in texas works here as well 
it also gets the point across in massachusetts he says 
it may not be the style that some reporters like it may not be 
the style that some people in universities like but its a style 
that the taxpayers like a very great deal 
still silber is learning to turn down the fire on the hustings 
after the first explosive weeks he began minding what he said he 
seems to have heeded his 95yearold mother who he says told him 
son your tongue will be your ruin 
a wittier circumspect john silber demonstrated what hes 
learned on the campaign trail at a breakfast early in march with 
150 members of the lexington chamber of commerce 
since coming to massachusetts 19 years ago he began i tried 
to tell the truth and shame the devil now ive heard i have to 
charm a few people at the same time 
he cracked a joke about the oncetouted massachusetts economic 
miracle a miracle is a phenomenon for which there is no rational 
explanation we had a massachusetts mirage 
the audience loved it 
many said they came out of curiosity to hear the one interesting 
candidate around but they were enchanted after he said how he 
wanted to overhaul the state budget process to tighten spending and 
efficiency how he wanted to weed out waste in state operations and 
put an end to amateur hour running state agencies how he was 
committed to improving education and stimulating the state economy 
with tax incentives

the son of a german architect and a texas schoolteacher silber 
is fond of saying he has been a democrat since age 10 he also 
voted for republican presidents reagan and bush he labels himself 
both a populist and an elitist and for a political novice he has 
shown a politicians flair in making over boston university and 
taking his message of education reform on the road 
i could be speaking every night in this state and that was 
before i announced for governor he says 
if you havent heard him speak you can read straight 
shooting whats wrong with america and how to fix it published 
last year by harper amp row 
silber was educated at trinity university in his hometown san 
antonio and at yale he has six daughters and a son he was 44 
when he took over boston university 19 years ago he had just been 
fired as dean of arts and sciences at the university of texas at 
austin following years of discord between him and the board of 
regents over changes made in his department and his criticism of 
university policies 
as the president of boston university he transformed an 
academically uneven debtburdened school into a solid institution 
with 26000 students an endowment of 183 million and a budget 
nearing 500 million 
the early years of his term at the university were rough silber 
fought with faculty over politics labor organizing and tenure he 
survived attempted faculty coups and revolts students and civil 
libertarians protested when he ordered the removal of 
antiapartheid banners from dormitory windows and he limited 
overnight dorm visits by members of the opposite sex 
silber wants to govern the state because he says he knows a 
better way and because he thinks public service is an obligation 
if it gets any deeper than that he wont say 
i think people who can serve and who can afford to take the 
financial sacrifice necessary to serve every now and then ought 
to do so 
as president of boston university silber gets 275000 a year 
and a house the governor earns 75000 and thats it 
massachusetts provides no governors mansion 
a lot of people wouldnt give up 200000 silber says i 
dont give a fig for money in that sense money never gave anybody 
a meaningful life 
william goetzmann a pulitzer prizewinning historian at the 
university of texas headed the department when silber was running 
things there in 196970 goetzmann is no silber chum but he 
respects him 
i would regard him as a tough person and yet underneath the 
sort of tough initial appearance or manner he can also be reasoned 
with goetzmann says 
goetzman says silber reminds him of michael dukakis with that 
sort of steely eyed determination 
he puts all his guns on the bar goetzman says he is a 
doer 
silber has the support of senate president william bulger one 
of the most powerful people at the statehouse and former boston 
mayor kevin white now a boston university faculty member 
but some political observers dont believe he can win 
it doesnt look good says paul watanabe a political 
scientist at the university of massachusetts in boston 
silber needs at least 15 percent of the approximately 5000 
state convention delegates to get on the sept 18 primary ballot 
ralph whitehead a political observer who teaches journalism at 
the university of massachusetts at amherst is more optimistic 
even in the clubby world of democratic party politics silber 
should be able to acquire the requisite delegates to make the 
primary whitehead says and with the campaign expected to be a 
string of debates silber can be expected to shine 
theres no question that the democratic state convention is 
highly unlikely to encourage a silber candidacy whitehead says 
nevertheless it might still accept a silber candidacy 
i dont count john silber out

after 15 years director francis ford coppola 
and actor al pacino are back together again to make a third 
godfather movie a supersecret production being filmed in 
rome sicily and new york at a cost of 44 million it is expected 
to be released around thanksgiving 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when it comes to making the godfather part iii 
omerta is the word 
silence the mafias code of silence 
i just know to keep my mouth shut and my script in the safe 
says franc dambrosio who plays tony corleone son of cosa nostra 
chieftain michael corleone 
when we last saw michael in godfather part ii he was 
having his older brother fredo shot through the head on a fishing 
boat on lake tahoe 
now 15 years later director francis ford coppola and most of 
the cast are back together to make the third chapter of one of the 
most successful movie sagas of all time 
the 44 million production set in 1979 is being shot in rome 
sicily and new york and is targeted for release in the united 
states around thanksgiving 
the basic storyline has leaked out michael played again by al 
pacino seeks to legitimize the corleone family by teaming up with 
a vatican archbishop who helps him acquire a stake in a european 
multinational corporation 
but the script and the stars especially pacino diane keaton 
and andy garcia are being kept tightly under wraps the final 12 
pages of the script are so secret they were reportedly printed on 
special paper that cant be photocopied 
dambrosio says pacino who is made up to look 60 years old and 
keaton who plays the dons estranged wife kay are so adamant 
about not being photographed that extras are checked to make sure 
theyre not sneaking cameras onto the set 
the production assistants are always aware of a flash 
anywhere says dambrosio turning to a nervous coppola aide for 
instructions on what he can and cant say 
coppola at age 50 has more than his artistic reputation on the 
line his financial survival is at stake a string of boxoffice 
flops such as one from the heart rumble fish and the 
outsiders have left him and his zoetrope studios in economic 
shambles 
in late january coppola and zoetrope productions filed for 
bankruptcy protection from creditors listing assets of 222 
million and debts of 289 million the move followed protracted 
litigation over debts owed to jack singer a canadian real estate 
developer who lent coppola 3 million to help him complete one 
from the heart 
coppola hopes to duplicate the success of the first two 
godfather movies which won the academy award for best picture 
in 1972 and 1974 and together have grossed some 800 million 
worldwide coppola was voted best director producer and writer for 
godfather ii widely hailed as one of the best film sequels 
ever made 
with marlon brando portraying aging boss vito corleone the 
first godfather described the ascendancy of the 
italianamerican corleone crime family in new york and las vegas 
son michael murders his fathers archenemy in a new york 
restaurant hides out in sicily for more than a year and returns 
to the united states to assume power as the new godfather 
part ii jumps back and forth between the early years of vito 
corleone played by robert de niro and the late 1950s when michael 
consolidates his power the film culminates with michael feeling 
betrayed having his brother murdered 
despite the obvious potential of a third godfather 
installment coppola had vowed not to get involved again with the 
corleone family 
if i had to do it i would just take the story and tell it 
again which is what they do on these sequels the director who 
declined to be interviewed for this article is quoted as saying in 
the recently released book coppola by peter cowie im not 
really interested in gangsters anymore 
it took paramount pictures 15 years to get the cameras rolling 
on godfather iii untold numbers of directors producers 
writers and screenplays were considered and rejected among the 
hollywood heavyweights reportedly interested in the project were 
sylvester stallone and eddie murphy 
last year coppola finally agreed to join forces again with mario 
puzo whose bestselling novel gave rise to the godfather 
movies to develop the story for part iii 
according to the hollywood trade publication variety coppolas 
decision probably stemmed in large part from the financial 
incentives paramount made him what else an offer he couldnt 
refuse some 6 million plus a share of the gross his signing 
fee for the first godfather was 125000 
to perfect the script coppola invited actors and crew to his 
1500acre estate in the napa valley near san francisco 
coppola has reassembled many of the cast and crew of the earlier 
godfather pictures for three months theyve been 
headquartered at romes cinecitta studios a 148acre complex where 
most of the interior scenes are being filmed 
behind the camera again are producers fred roos and gray 
frederickson production designer dean tavoularis photography 
director gordon willis and music composer carmine coppola the 
directors father 
on screen besides pacino and keaton coppolas sister talia 
shire is back as connie corleone and al martino returns as johnny 
fontane the crooner in the first godfather 
but there are also new faces and a new generation of corleones 
the key figure is garcia who plays vincent mancini michaels 
illegitimate nephew born of the tryst between sonny corleone and a 
bridesmaid during the wedding party in the first film vincent is 
michaels apparent heir coppolas daughter sofia has the role of 
mary corleone michaels daughter 
other newcomers are bridget fonda as journalist grace madison 
joe mantegna as gangster joey zasa george hamilton as arbitrageur 
bj harrison and eli wallach as don altobello 
donal donnelly plays irish archbishop terence kilday a vatican 
bank official who acts as the intermediary in the corleone familys 
new business ventures the story stems from the reallife scandal 
involving the vatican banks alleged role in the 1982 collapse of 
banco ambrosiano italys largest private bank 
dambrosio a 27yearold tenor from new york was a surprise 
choice for the role of tony corleone he was appearing in 
broadways sweeney todd when he was signed up beating out more 
than 1000 others who auditioned for the part it is his first 
movie

in the adirondack mountains of upstate new york 
the village of saranac lake was known as the city of the sick 
a place where tuberculosis sufferers came to take the cure modern 
antibiotics put an end to that and the town almost died 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
saranac lake once was a typical 
oneindustry town with a difference 
its business was illness 
for nearly 70 years saranac lake was synonymous with both a 
feared disease tuberculosis and the sanitarium cure medical 
sciences best guess as to how to treat what was once mankinds 
greatest killer 
the tb sufferers have been gone for a generation but saranac 
lake endures still proud to be known as the city of the sick 
salvation to tb sufferers came in the early 1950s with the 
development of an effective antibiotic treatment for the disease 
but that also dealt an economic blow to this remote adirondack 
mountain village about 270 miles north of new york city 
it was a disaster for the community says barbara parnass of 
historic saranac lake a preservation group it wasnt the kind 
of thing that was dramatic like a fire but the slow ebbing of the 
curing industry affected the community very severely 
in its curing heyday spitting on saranac lakes sidewalks could 
get you a summons from the police because the dreaded tb infection 
was contained in the sputum of a tubercular it was a place where 
radios went dead each afternoon when tb patients were supposed to 
be resting silently in the open air of their cure porches 
in some ways the village had been run by the doctors and the 
lawyers and the bankers parnass says they sat on the board of 
health they made the rules and regulations there was a very 
precise booklet printed up telling everyone how to behave when the 
curing collapsed the doctors retired or they found other places to 
practice that left an awful lot of the service industry here with 
nobody to service 
only in recent years has saranac lake finally showed signs of 
snapping out of it the tudorstyle will rogers hospital which 
once cared for show business tuberculars has just been converted 
to condominiums 
the trudeau sanitarium is now a conference center owned by the 
american management association the nearby ray brook sanitarium is 
a state prison 
and many of the 300 cure cottages the residential 
minihospitals that made saranac lake unique among tb centers are 
being restored by private homeowners to their turnofthecentury 
grandeur 
parnass says the sudden collapse of the tb industry helped from 
the viewpoint of historical preservation in saranac lake 
when the plug was pulled the economic bottom dropped out of 
the whole village she says the railroad stopped running 
there was no money to tear down and put up new houses in some ways 
it was good because it held the housing stock where it was 
nine out of 10 structures in saranac lake which has about 5500 
residents today were built before world war ii parnass group 
recently applied to have 187 buildings in the village including 63 
cure cottages added to the national register of historic places 
the village is remembering its legacy in other ways too 
a sign proclaiming saranac lake as americas pioneer health 
resort still greets visitors in september parnass group will 
sponsor the second reunion in saranac lake of cure patients their 
relatives doctors nurses and others involved in the tb industry 
about 200 people attended the first reunion in 1987 
they are among the dwindling circle of people who remember 
firsthand the misery and terror generated by tuberculosis 
the disease was the white plague the killer that stalked 
slums and fashionable drawing rooms with equal impunity keats 
thoreau and kafka were just a few of the leading lights of their 
ages to die from the disease popularly called consumption 
because of the way tb appears to consume the tattered tissue of the 
lungs of victims stricken with its most common form pulmonary 
tuberculosis 
what made tuberculosis seem even more terrible was that for a 
long time no one was sure what caused it even when a german 
physician dr robert koch identified the bacterium responsible 
for tb in 1882 it took researchers another 70 years to find the 
right antibiotics to effectively attack the infection 
dr lee reichman speaking for the american lung association 
compared the fear surrounding tb when it was at its height in the 
late 19th century and early 20th century as similar to the fear now 
created by acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
in their quest to find some effective treatment for the disease 
american doctors began to recommend that tuberculars live in dry 
climates or in elevated places like the mountains of the american 
southwest the rockies or the adirondacks of new york state it was 
thought that such an atmosphere would dry out the clogged lungs of 
tb patients and retard the spread of their infections 
dr edward livingston trudeau a tubercular who believed that 
being in the adirondacks saved his life was credited with 
popularizing the region as a health resort 
in 1884 trudeau established the first us sanitarium for the 
treatment of tb patients in saranac lake modeled on german 
sanitariums of the same era trudeau used the tiny twopatient 
cottage later nicknamed little red to develop a model for 
treatment that was eventually adopted by most american sanitariums 
the main activity at a san was inactivity 
patients were exposed to fresh air during the harshest days of 
winter as well as in sweltering summer heat by sitting quietly for 
hours at a time on specially designed lounging chairs patients 
deemed too ill to sit or stand were wheeled onto the porches in 
their beds the body temperature and weight of patients was 
monitored carefully and a great emphasis was placed on proper diet 
saranac lake took pains to be a happy place to make tuberculars 
welcome and to ease their burden there were picnics sleigh rides 
hay rides and bedside instruction on activities from bookbinding 
and birdwatching 
a winter carnival that began in 1897 as a diversion for tb 
patients is now billed by village fathers as the oldest of its kind 
in the united states

from the shenandoah valley of west virginia 
the martinsburg monster is keeping an eye on american 
taxpayers the monster is a huge central computer center where 
the internal revenue service keeps track of its 1 trillionayear 
collections 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the heart of the internal revenue 
service doesnt beat it whirls beeps and blinks at dizzying 
speeds on dozens of computers and about 330000 spools of computer 
tape guarded like a fortress 
it has your number 
this is the one place where it all comes together and where it 
all goes back out says gerald rabe director of the martinsburg 
computing center dubbed the martinsburg monster 
i would say the computer system we use here is probably second 
to none in the amount of data processed 
row upon row of blueandtan computers hum inside a singlestory 
brick building about 80 miles northwest of washington sending and 
retrieving bits of information from the tax returns of more than 
140 million individual taxpayers and about 50 million businesses 
the magnetic tapes in the master file could circle the earth at 
the equator 5 times irs spokesman charles koeneke says 
income interest deductions and other tabulations from every 
tax return filed in the united states are stored at the center for 
an average of five years 
paper returns are sent to federal records centers around the 
country where they are stored in boxes for an average of seven 
years before they are burned 
it depends on what type of taxpayer the individual is rabe 
says if you have a criminal case or there is some other problem 
those records are kept longer than those of a socalled good 
taxpayer 
information gleaned from president bushs recent tax returns is 
stored here among tidbits gleaned from ronald reagans donald 
trumps and those with more mundane tax histories 
all taxpayers are created equal in our eyes rabe says 
the computer tapes which make up the irs master file are locked 
away in the centers roomsize vault kept between 68 and 72 degrees 
and at 35 percent relative humidity the vault uses heat generated 
by the centers dozens of mainframe computers and body heat to keep 
the nearly constant conditions 
the 1 trillion in federal taxes paid in fiscal 1988 paid for 
the irs center and most of the rest of the federal government 
according to frank keith an irs spokesman in washington 
the master file is restricted to a limited number of employees 
and 10 irs service centers in atlanta philadelphia kansas city 
mo andover mass austin texas holtsville ny covington 
ky fresno calif memphis tenn and ogden utah 
the regional centers use the master file to verify returns and 
to determine whether a tax refund or payment is due 
it takes 700 computer programmers analysts operators and 
others working three shifts every day to keep the center operating 
all year 
everyone thinks were coming up to the busiest time of year 
for the irs thats not true rabe says we have a work 
schedule that keeps us busy 52 weeks a year the business side goes 
on yearround with the filing of quarterly reports and other 
programs 
the peoples tax returns are guarded in an accountants fort 
knox 
the lowslung buffcolored building is surrounded by a 
10foothigh chainlink fence topped with strands of glistening 
barbed wire armed irs guards patrol the grounds set among apple 
and peach orchards in the shenandoah valley 
three hidden diesel generators stand ready to deliver emergency 
electricity to the centers computers and air conditioning system 
in the event of a blackout 
teams of programmers and technicians are oncall 24 hours a day 
at the center to purge glitches and to keep data from disappearing 
koeneke refused to divulge other backups for the heart of the 
irs system that reaches into the pockets of millions of taxpayers 
each april 15 
were probably the best kept secret in town he says 
when the center opened in 1961 with five employees there was 
little inkling of the explosive growth to come it had a single ibm 
computer with less storage capacity than most of todays home 
computers and 1700 magnetic tapes to handle an estimated 78 
million tax returns 
the original 39000squarefoot center cost 53 million in 
1961 at the time many believed it was built in martinsburg 
because of west virginias critical support of john f kennedy over 
hubert humphrey in the states 1960 democratic primary for the 
presidential nomination 
since then the center has more than tripled in size it is one 
of the largest employers in west virginias eastern panhandle 
before the center opened tax returns were processed by 
thousands of clerks who relied on boxes and boxes of records kept 
around the country 
the irs is now testing a system that accepts electronic tax 
returns prepared by computer and the storage of data on electronic 
disks instead of magnetic tape 
were just getting into telecommunications says rabe who 
started his irs career as a computer programmer trainee in 1964 
critics including members of congress and the general 
accounting office have said the irs needs to replace its aging 
computer system a move that could cost as much 11 billion 
according to sen david pryor dark chairman of the senate 
finance oversight subcommittee the gao puts the cost between 3 
billion and 4 billion 
planned improvements will put laptop computers into the hands of 
revenue agents and tax collectors 
an expanded master file operating as a data base available to a 
number of computer facilities also is in the works irs officials 
say 
we want to get to the point where banks and gas and electric 
companies are right now said rabe if you call us with a 
question we want to be able to call up your entire account on the 
computer screen and answer your questions immediately instead of 
waiting there to get a response from a service center

the word is that elvis is not dead just 
waiting to make a comeback 
the abc sunday night television series which stars michael st 
gerard as rock n roll singer elvis presley was taken off the air 
in midmarch after a poor performance in the ratings race 
the critically acclaimed show continues in production however 
as the network looks for a new time period abc officials say it 
could return as early as may 
abc had high hopes for elvis which followed americas 
funniest home videos on sunday but several things happened to 
derail those hopes the video show became such a runaway hit that 
the ratings for elvis by comparison looked dismal even a 
preview behind toprated roseanne didnt help 
next fox broadcasting scheduled the animated show the 
simpsons against it and that show creamed elvis most young 
viewers watch abcs americas funniest home videos then switch 
to fox for the simpsons the rest of the country watches cbss 
murder she wrote or the nbc movie in the ratings elvis 
came in only slightly ahead of the fox alsorans 
the decision to pull elvis came after americas funniest 
home videos finished first in the nielsen ratings for the week 
ending march 11 while elvis was 45th abc felt it had to act 
because of the enormous drop in viewership 
in the overall ratings for the 198990 season elvis was in 
56th place halfway through the nielsen ratings of the 112 shows in 
prime time including those that have been replaced 
on the plus side elvis did better than anything else abc 
has tried in that sunday time slot in a long time 
young viewers who control the sets early sunday night apparently 
arent aware of presley if they remember him at all its from his 
later bloated las vegas years even st gerard whos 27 
concedes he wasnt an elvis fan 
st gerard in an interview before the abc decision said that 
he doesnt pay much attention to the ratings and that abc 
executives told him they would stick with the show 
i do my best and after that its not in my hands he says 
i figure anybody cool is going to watch us its a quality show 
the critical reaction has been overwhelming we set out to do 
something respectful of an american legend i never took this as a 
joke 
the show is filmed on authentic locations in memphis tenn and 
st gerard strives for an interpretation rather than an imitation 
he looks remarkably like presley even without the benefit of makeup 
and he possesses the singers early charm and shyness 
he lipsyncs to lyrics sung by ronnie mcdowell because the 
scenes require more flexibility than is found in original presley 
recordings 
st gerard was in los angeles for a few days after he began 
filming elvis late last year he lives in new york where he 
played a small role in an abc afterschool special the accident 
regardless of the outcome of elvis st gerard seems assured 
of a booming career he previously starred in the movie 
hairspray and now hes reading nine scripts to see what his 
next picture will be first he was returning to memphis to film 
four more episodes of elvis 
im anxious to get back he says i love the south i miss 
it i miss my friends there i miss elvis too its funny i miss 
playing the part 
elvis was a very complex person he was naive in some ways 
but in other ways he was very focused and determined he knew how 
to get his point across he had a way of handling himself on 
stage he was the king 
st gerard says filming elvis in memphis has been like a 
homecoming in some respects priscilla presley elvis former wife 
is one of the executive producers many of presleys old friends 
have shown up to help 
he plays presley between ages 19 and 21 when times were still 
tough and the singer was just beginning to attract attention with 
his music billy green bush plays his father and millie perkins 
the diary of anne frank plays his mother 
i hope we can take the show up to the time when his mother 
dies st gerard says that was the end of an era she died in 
1958 when he was in the army after that his motivation changed 
in the beginning his motivation was to pull his family out of its 
lower economic strata he had a lot of drive 
elvis presley has been portrayed on the screen before kurt 
russell played him in the 1977 abc movie elvis which beat 
gone with the wind in the ratings don johnson was presley in 
the 1981 nbc movie elvis and the beauty queen dale midkiff was 
presley in the 1988 tv movie elvis and me based on priscilla 
presleys book mcdowell sang for all the movies

since stephen lang landed his latest role as a 
marine officer in a few good men on broadway he has been 
obsessively shining his boots 
in the play at the music box theater lang is lt col nathan 
jessup a base commander so gungho hes demented 
when im shining my boots it makes me feel more like a 
marine lang says ive been working on my left boot for 
months it will not take a shine its recalcitrant 
lang arrives at the theater two or three hours before the 
curtain goes up im chronically early he says the deeper i 
get into a run the more necessary it is for me to put in the time 
i enjoy coming in and jessuping around for a while ill 
look in the mirror and try to find him i lift a couple of 
weights 
lang says some aspects of characters he plays often stick with 
him off the stage 
but i keep a pretty sharp lasso on them too i havent been 
marching the troops at home 
and he made sure that harry black the total wreck of a human 
being he plays in the new film last exit to brooklyn stayed 
at the movies allnight shoots 
a few good men has been bought but not cast for a movie 
lang and his wife of 10 years met when she designed his costume 
for a tv drama i think big families are coming back he says 
we have a girl two boys and are expecting a girl 
his father eugene lang a company president told 61 
sixthgraders in harlem in 1981 that if they finished high school 
hed pay their college tuition he later founded the i have a dream 
foundation which now has 130 sponsors in 32 cities backing more 
than 8000 children 
hes a guy whos always looking for outlets for his own 
creativity and he found it in a really unique way says the 
younger lang 
about his own profession lang says i think i was born to act 
and im very lucky that i just knew that i dont do it for 
therapy im less neurotic about acting than i am about most other 
things 
in a few good men a marine private has died and two marines 
are accused of murder a lawyer played by tom hulce suspects 
jessup of being behind the death 
jessup is one of the more interesting complex characters lang 
has played he has not turned into an egomaniac lang says i 
think he manipulates the power of the office and the power of his 
personality 
jessup is a great quoter the author aaron sorkin wanted to 
endow him with a certain arcane elegance to make him not just a 
contemporary figure but a largerthanlife figure who can speak 
with real authority on literature and poetry 
i think we associate jessup with a passion yeats said the 
worst are full of a passionate intensity while the best lack all 
conviction in that sense you could say jessup is one of the worst 
he is not a skeptic in an age of skepticism and he is not a cynic 
in an age of cynicism neither is he a blind believer he is a man 
who has chosen a path for himself whether we admire that path or 
not 
when jessup goes he flames out he is not seeking 
treatment he says this is who i am 
lang recently played a different type of soldier a homeless 
vietnam vet in steve tesichs speed of darkness in chicago 
hell probably repeat it on broadway 
lang played happy when dustin hoffman starred in death of a 
salesman on broadway and was rosencrantz in an offbroadway 
revival of rosencrantz and gildenstern are dead 
he wants to play hamlet having played horatio to christopher 
walkens hamlet in 1982 and hed like to use his character 
singing voice in gilbert and sullivan his childhood theatrical 
love 
id be a good jack point in the yeomen of the guard he 
says if anybody asked me to do it id have a very hard time 
turning it down

noriega is gone but onethird of 
panamanians are out of work and unemployment has become the 
greatest threat to the new government 
it has to be resolved or the country will go into a spiral of 
robberies strikes demonstrations against the government and 
backlash against the us said carlos rodriguez a panamanian 
who is vice president of the american chamber of commerce 
for now there seems to be no opposition to president guillermo 
endaras new government the end of gen manuel antonio noriegas 
corrupt repressive dictatorship and the lifting of us economic 
sanctions have brought hope 
the government is scratching to keep itself afloat however and 
has nothing to invest in reactivating the economy it is looking to 
us aid and private enterprise to do the job 
jorge heraza 21 finished high school three years ago with a 
specialty in commercial accounting which seemed sensible in an 
economy that is 70 percent to 80 percent services he still fills 
out job applications and still has no job 
the dec 20 invasion that ousted noriega and installed endara 
seemed like a good idea he said but they must follow through 
they say theyre going to give jobs but unemployment with what 
has happened it is worse 
government officials say about 33 percent of the work force 
estimated at 650000 people is unemployed 
looting and vandalism that accompanied the invasion caused about 
90 percent of businesses to close raising the jobless figure from 
about 20 percent before the political crisis began in 1987 about 
10 percent of panamanians did not have jobs 
endara fasted during the first 12 days of march to dramatize 
panamas economic problems he has criticized the slow pace of us 
aid and of freeing government funds frozen during the noriega 
regime 
people cannot eat democracy the president said there 
could be popular unrest unless there are some quick solutions the 
congressional delay of approval endangers our democracy 
of the bush administrations 1 billion package congress has 
approved 43 million to rebuild the chorrillo neighborhood which 
was destroyed in the invasion and the start of credit the 
administration says is worth 500 million 
panamanians say they are wellequipped to use aid effectively 
panama is not a basket case like some other countries said 
rodriguez the general manager of colgatepalmolives operations in 
panama it has good infrastructure a good entrepreneurial 
class 
with the us dollar as its currency panama was a thriving 
international banking and trade center 
that ended with the political crisis created by us indictments 
of noriega for drug trafficking his dismissal of presidents the 
closing of banks for nine weeks in 1988 and us economic sanctions 
assets in the cluster of gleaming modern banking towers 
plummeted from 40 billion in june 1987 to less than 15 million 
two years later 
on streets that had teemed with visitors buying cameras 
electronic equipment watches and tailored suits business slowed 
to a trickle 
the gross national product fell 20 percent in 1988 and 75 
percent more in 1989 much of the governments revenue was lost to 
corruption 
if you stop the corruption that by itself is income it was 
that bad said guillermo ford the second vice president and 
planning minister 
since the invasion the government has survived on gradually 
improving tax revenue and partial release of the 390 million in 
frozen funds 
there is a change in mentality about taxes said willie 
cochez the new mayor of panama city they know people like 
president endara will not steal the money and they decide to pay 
officials continue plugging corruption leaks kindergartens are 
3000 a month better off since cochez sent a department head to 
jail for stealing that much 
new officials cut their own salaries which saves 21 million a 
year endaras pay was reduced from 10000 a month to 7000 
until panama pays the 540 million in arrears on its 52 
billion foreign debt it will not be eligible for new loans 
rodriguez the businessman feels panamanians may be too 
optimistic 
people probably feel the problems are over and they are not 
he said they probably think it will rebound to pre1987 in three 
months and it will not 
he said unemployment is a time bomb against the endara 
government or any democratic government 
government strategy is to strengthen the private sector by 
selling stateowned air panama sugar mills and cement and citrus 
processing plants ford said 
some businessmen even suggest that the panama canal to be 
turned over to panama at the end of 1999 could be operated as a 
concession 
a major worry in this strategy is reducing the payroll of 
150000 before there are enough new jobs for the people dismissed 
crime has skyrocketed because of unemployment and because so 
many weapons are in the hands of paramilitary groups set up by 
noriega police said murders have gone up from four a month to 30 
for the long term rodriguez said officials speak of a 
uspanama free trade agreement similar to those the united states 
has with canada and israel 
panama has had the colon freetrade zone for years and it was 
not seriously affected by the crisis officials are promoting 
establishment of new inbond plants there which assemble products 
for export and expansion of existing ones 
the zone also does a brisk trade in transshipment of goods 
international banking could revive but is considered unlikely 
to regain its former prominence panamanians dismiss concerns that 
the banks could again become a haven for drug money and say current 
secrecy laws allow access to information when laundering is 
suspected 
the perception in panama is that the us is delaying approval 
of the economic recovery package to squeeze out tighter 
restrictions on banking tighter restrictions on cubarelated 
companies rodriguez said 
ruben dario carles a former banker and now the governments 
comptroller said we cannot sit and wait we have to deliver the 
goods we have to get this thing moving 
every unemployed person has a reason to protest and it will be 
bad if 200000 protest

athletes run for many reasons but members of the fiftyplus 
runners association have found a new one they run for science 
of course the members run for all those other reasons too 
keeping fit losing weight improving their heart and lungs 
dealing with tension or depression or becoming or staying 
competitive 
their personal goals dovetail nicely with researchers desires 
to learn more about the effects of extended physical activity on 
older people 
we see this organization as a role model a pioneering group 
its a whole new lifestyle for older men and women said keith 
johnsgard president of fiftyplus and a professor at san jose 
state university in california they dont have to live the 
sedentary life that older people do or are expected to 
fiftyplus is not a running club sponsored by the center for 
research in disease prevention at stanford university its goal is 
to gather a list of highly active seniors for researchers to plumb 
fiftyplus has 1600 members 
topics already being studied include how continued physical 
exercise affects osteoarthritis and osteoporosis researchers have 
found that older runners male and female had about 40 percent 
more bone mineral and no more tendencies toward osteoarthritis in 
their knees than seniors who dont exercise 
before this it was generally thought that people who spent a 
lot of time running would invariably damage their knees said 
peter wood a biochemist former fiftyplus president and coauthor 
of the study 
wood said good mineral density was important especially for 
women because it helped prevent problems like dowagers hump or 
osteoporosis 
researchers also have found that fiftyplus members consumed 40 
percent to 60 percent more calories daily than their sedentary 
peers but had higher levels of the good cholesterol 
highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol which has been associated 
with a relatively low risk of heart disease 
when you are eating a good amount you are more likely to get 
an adequate supply of nutrients and for women a good supply of 
calcium wood said 
the groups most recent survey found that 85 percent of its 
members were men they averaged 598 years old have been running 
for 137 years and covered 264 miles per week fortyfive percent 
had completed a marathon 262 miles and the vast majority had run 
at least one 10kilometer 62 miles race 
fiftyplus women averaged 588 years had been running for 95 
years and covered an average of 212 miles a week 
fiftyplus now is looking for a corporate sponsor to help 
increase its membership and attract a wider group of scientists 
wed like to expand membership and get some really good 
longterm studies going johnsgard said bring in some young 
hotshot epidemiologist who can study us until were all dead we 
are too old to do the really longterm stuff 
several members cited the research emphasis as the reason they 
joined fiftyplus 
the studies attracted me to it said kent gartner 56 a 
cell biologist at memphis state university who has been running for 
20 years 
the research theyre doing is not only interesting its 
important said bob binzer 67 of madison ind its 
inspiring and you get good advice from the organization 
binzer was referring to the associations quarterly newsletter 
which summarizes research involving members and publishes health 
and sportsrelated articles 
i really enjoy the newsletter and its great theyre doing 
this research agreed betty brinkmann 55 of brighton colo a 
dietician she says she often uses information from the newsletter 
in her own work with cardiovascular rehabilitation patients 
johnsgard a clinical psychologist has studied what prompts 
seniors to begin running and then keep running using fiftyplus 
members the book that resulted the exercise prescription for 
depression and anxiety examines the beneficial effects of 
continued physical activity on seniors mental health 
the athletes get together once a year this year theyll meet 
sunday at stanford for a seminar and business meeting a generous 
pasta dinner and an eightkilometer run agegroup categories for 
the race begin at 50 and go up to 100 in fiveyear intervals with 
nearly 400 runners expected 
its a gathering of the brothers and the sisters a tribal 
thing johnsgard said people who exercise regularly in the 
us are unusual but people over 50 who exercise are extremely 
rare its like coming home

the entry requirements are few 
you have to be an active downhill skier you must be 70 years 
of age says lloyd t lambert founder of the 70plus ski club 
you pay 5 for a lifetime membership 
the claims more than 5500 members across the country 
im not that speedy any more but weve got some really 
really hot shots said lambert 89 who heads the group from his 
home in ballston lake 
senior citizens are staying in shape on the slopes in droves 
these days and the trend shows no signs of slowing with older 
americans keener than ever to stay active skiing is an ideal way 
to exercise through the winter 
its caught on now to where it membership has grown 75 
percent a year said bill vandersluin 59 spokesman for the over 
the hill gang an elderly skiers group based in aurora colo 
one member from los angeles is living proof theres never any 
shortage of energy in the group said vandersluin 
she skis like a demon he said shes 86 and she has no 
grey hair 
the over the hill gang which offers its 2400 members white 
water rafting deep sea fishing and hiking as well as skiing trips 
has a minimum membership age of 50 
about 68 percent of the 18 million to 20 million skiers in the 
united states are 55 or older said chris stoddard a spokesman for 
the united ski industries association the association is a 
national trade group for ski areas and ski equipment suppliers 
the 70plus ski club and the over the hill gang hold ski 
gatherings across the country and provide their members with 
information about where they can ski for free or at discount rates 
three hundred older skiers descended on the catskills in new 
york earlier this month for the 70plus ski clubs annual meeting 
and races at hunter mountain 
lambert got back from a 70plus trip to switzerland last month 
but hes off again for more skiing in july this time to argentina 
injuries among elderly skiers are few and the accidents they 
suffer often have little to do with their age lambert said 
these guys on snow boards have run into a few of our 
members said lambert one had a broken shoulder another had 
broken ribs and another one was bumped around 
injuries on the slopes have been reduced from 77 accidents per 
1000 ski visits in the 1950s to 25 injuries per 1000 visits 
today according to stoddard 
skiing has an image that youre going to fall and break 
something he said that image is just not true 
stoddard said many older skiers avoid injury because they are 
usually experienced and he attributed the overall drop in skiing 
injuries to improvements in boot bindings and snow making and 
grooming 
lambert recalls pine toestrap skies he owned when he first hit 
the slopes in 1915 
you couldnt turn or do anything that you could today because 
you had nothing to hold your heel in place lambert said if 
you wanted to stop you had to fall down or kick the skis off

once introduced as a senator in his 90s for 
the 90s j strom thurmond is running for reelection and 
neither his age nor his dixiecrat past looks like a serious 
obstacle to a seventh term 
he has coopted damn near everybody in south carolina in one 
fashion or another said don fowler a democratic political 
consultant trying to explain why his party was having so much 
trouble finding a candidate to oppose the 87yearold republican 
senator 
thurmond has this very unique status in the state where it 
would be almost an act of discourtesy to run against him i think 
thats how some of these people perceive it said earl black a 
political scientist at the university of south carolina 
regardless of your political views everyone has great 
affection for him said phil lader the democrat contemplating a 
run against thurmond 
lader a 44yearold businessman 2 years old in 1948 when 
thurmond then governor of south carolina ran for president as a 
dixiecrat a candidacy driven by opposition to integration 
all the laws of washington and all the bayonets of the army 
cannot force the negro into our homes our schools our churches 
and our places of recreation thurmond vowed 
that was 42 years ago times changed and so did thurmond not as 
fast maybe but he changed 
people who live in contemporary times recognize that people 
change said theo mitchell a state senator planning to challenge 
republican gov carroll campbell in november 
mitchell is black and said that despite thurmonds 
segregationist past the senator has support in the black 
community 
people have done things in bygone eras that they certainly 
wouldnt do now said mitchell attitudes change as well as 
times 
thurmond lobbied to get president nixon to appoint a black to 
the federal bench and supported legislation to make martin luther 
king jrs birthday a national holiday 
those were among the highprofile stands that won thurmond 
support among blacks equally important are daytoday constituent 
services performed by his staff locating the lost social security 
check speeding veterans benefits 
people who have problems know that they can get quick 
responses from thurmonds staff said black 
call him beloved call him respected and a master of constituent 
services but he also is 87 years old 
it was lee atwater a thurmond protege and now republican party 
chairman who once was introducing the senator at a dinner and 
joked that thurmond should use the slogan a senator in his 90s 
for the 90s for his next reelection campaign 
the audience roared the senator looked a bit uncertain for a 
moment and then joined in the laughter 
thurmond was born nine years before ronald reagan he made his 
dixiecrat bid for the white house three years before reagan starred 
in bedtime for bonzo 
this time around thurmond already is running campaign 
commercials on south carolina television stations they show the 
senator bounding up the steps of the us capitol and doing 
pushups in his office 
an even bigger part of the legend of eternal youth is the 
thurmond family his wife nancy is a former beauty queen who 
married the senator when he was in his 60s and she was not yet 20 
they went on to have four children 
lader said he would not directly raise age as an issue 
its up to the voters not me to determine whether a senator 
who would be in his 90s for most of his term is serving 
effectively he said 
the senate democratic campaign committee has been urging lader 
to make the run but he described himself as taking his time about 
making a decision 
thousands of south carolinians have received calls from thurmond 
during his long career lader among them 
the last call that i got on my way to my wedding 10 years ago 
was from senator thurmond he recalled he called to wish me 
well

lennie williams smiles as she talks of her dead 
husband and the small home he helped her build 42 years ago 
for the moment at least the povertystricken 77yearold 
widow seems unaware that transamerica corp wants her worn but tidy 
home because she cant make payments of 499 a month 
mrs williams who supports herself on 438 a month doesnt 
remember her husband died 12 years ago or that she put up the 
house in a workingclass phoenix neighborhood as security for a 
loan taken out by her former soninlaw in 1987 
the transamerica loan officer who handled the transaction says 
he doubts mrs williams knew what she was doing the soninlaw has 
disappeared 
state rep sandra kennedy who has known mrs williams for more 
than 12 years believes mrs williams was confused in 1987 so does 
the doctor treating her at the time she signed the loan papers 
she couldnt even remember what pills to take said the doctor 
tali arik 
alfred rogers a maricopa county superior court judge who has 
heard pretrial testimony in mrs williams case says its likely 
that transamerica which measures profits in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars knew or should have known mrs williams was 
defrauded 
transamerica which used the slogan our heart is everywhere 
on its latest annual report is not persuaded the san 
franciscobased financial giant is pressing for trial and demanding 
mrs williams make payments 
the lawsuit was filed by mrs williams and her legal guardian 
and seeks to block transamerica financial services inc a 
subsidiary from foreclosing it also seeks to void her part of the 
contract and win damages no trial has been scheduled 
the case is the latest in a series involving consumerloan 
companies and comes at a time when the collapse of many thrifts 
has forced more middleclass borrowers to turn to them 
in arizona alone itt financial services paid 17 million to 
settle one classaction lawsuit and household finance corp paid 
about 4 million to settle another transamerica financial services 
has already offered to pay about 4 million to settle a 
classaction lawsuit that accuses it of gouging poor and 
middleincome borrowers 
transamerica officials did not return repeated calls seeking 
comment on the williams case but one of its attorneys robert 
miles said the company believes it is entitled to the property 
miles said he could not discuss the case in detail 
arizona superintendent of banks william h rivoir iii said 
confidentiality laws prohibit him from saying whether his agency is 
investigating mrs williams case 
loanindustry lobbyists say this case must be an aberration 
however bill morris director of litigation at southern arizona 
legal aid in tucson and chief architect of the classaction suits 
said the situation is believed to occur frequently 
after rogers issued a preliminary injunction blocking 
transamerica from foreclosing the company insisted mrs williams 
post bond of 499 a month 61 more than her monthly income 
at a minimum it said she should post a 20000 down payment 
and pay 425 a month thereafter 
the amount was bargained down to 150 a month without the down 
payment after mrs williams lawyer threatened to take the case to 
higher courts and set a statewide precedent if successful 
miles said the bond was needed to make sure the case goes to 
trial quickly but doug erickson one of mrs williams lawyers 
says hes already agreed to a speedy trial 
before the foreclosure action mrs williams paid 800 and 
offered to pay an additional 350 a month with help from relatives 
sworn testimony by the loan officer shows it was mrs williams 
soninlaw william smith who wanted the money in the first place 
smith had married mrs williams daughter alma but hadnt lived 
with her for years said ms kennedy and rachel freeman mrs 
williams greatniece and recently appointed legal guardian 
alma died early in 1987 months later smith came around and 
promised he would help fix mrs williams home according to ms 
freeman 
instead he allegedly took her to transamerica had her cosign 
a 32000 loan and disappeared mrs williams attorneys have 
obtained a judgment against him but its of little value since 
they dont know where he is 
the loan officer patrick rajski said smith would not have 
qualified for a loan without the house as security 
with an interest rate of nearly 18 percent plus 8 points in 
prepaid charges the loan called for total payments of 89820 or 
499 a month over 15 years 
before bringing mrs williams in for the loansigning smith 
said that the least i said to her about the loan the better off 
it would be rajski added in sworn testimony before rogers 
i felt uneasy about it he testified adding that he went 
through with the loan anyway and never told mrs williams she could 
lose her home 
i didnt want to bring up the fact that we could foreclose on 
your home people dont want to hear this rajski said when 
you close a loan you try to get through with it you say 
everything you have to say and no more 
i really dont think that she fully understood said rajski 
who has left transamerica for another sales job 
i went over the loan papers he said when she left was i 
satisfied that she knew what she was getting into no 
sitting at home last week mrs williams appeared unaware of the 
problem asked how she spent her days for example she replied 
i work for white people referring to domestic work she has not 
done for years 
it was after her heart attack that she just kind of floated 
away said ms kennedy it hurt my heart when her daughter 
died because she got worse 
prescription medicine alone consumes about 80 a month of the 
438 mrs williams gets from social security and a veterans 
pension according to ms freeman who moved in with her greataunt 
and found lawyers to help her after transamerica threatened 
foreclosure 
the paint is peeling and the cheap carpeting is worn but the 
photos and trinkets of a lifetime are all neatly in place and ms 
freeman and her son have patched the roof repaired the water 
heater and more since moving in to the house on a 
7500squarefoot lot in south phoenix 
if transamerica gets its way mrs williams would be put out 
on the street with nowhere to go ms kennedy says im 
surprised shes made it this far

as they agonize over yet another tax season and an 
april 15 deadline taxpayers should remember that with careful 
planning many taxsaving ideas are available 
following are three significant taxsaving tips for people over 
55 that should be considered when preparing returns 
sale of a home 
if you sold your home during 1989 there are several options if 
the sale resulted in a loss the loss generally is a nondeductable 
personal loss however a gain on the sale may qualify for special 
tax treatment 
if a taxpayer buys a new principal residence within two years of 
the date of sale of the old principal residence the taxpayer will 
not be required to pay tax on all the gain from the sale the 
taxpayer will pay tax on the gain only to the extent that the 
adjusted sales price of the old residence exceeds the cost of 
the new one the adjusted sales price equals the selling price 
of the residence reduced by sales expenses such as advertising 
commissions and legal fees and further reduced by expenses for 
decorating and repairing to help sell the old home 
only expenses for work performed within 90 days before the 
contract to sell was signed and paid for within 30 days after the 
sale qualify capital expenses such as permanent improvements or 
replacements are added to the value of the home 
if the cost of the new residence exceeds the adjusted sales 
price of the old one no tax is paid on the sale this is known as 
a rollover of the gain or a section 1034 exchange this treatment 
is automatic if a new home is purchased in this situation the 
basis tax cost of the new residence will be reduced by the amount 
of gain postponed 
if the taxpayer sells a principal residence but does not replace 
it it still may be possible to qualify for special tax treatment 
if the taxpayer is 55 or older on the date of the sale he or she 
may be able to exclude up to 125000 of gain on the sale also the 
taxpayer must have used the residence as his or her main home 
for at least three years during the five years before the sale the 
election to exclude the gain from the sale is available only once 
in a lifetime and is made on part 1 of form 2119 
standard deductions and additional considerations 
the taxpayer is allowed to deduct the greater of the standard 
deduction or total itemized deductions the amount of the standard 
deduction is dependent upon the taxpayers filing status 
married couples filing jointly are entitled to a 5200 standard 
deduction single taxpayers are entitled to a 3100 standard 
deduction the standard deduction for heads of households is 
4550 and for married people filing separately 2600 
in addition married people who are 65 or older or blind are 
entitled to an additional standard deduction of 600 1200 if 
both 65 and blind single taxpayers who are 65 or older or blind 
are entitled to an additional standard deduction of 750 1500 if 
both 
if the taxpayer was completely blind as of dec 31 1989 a 
statement should be attached to the tax return describing the 
condition if the taxpayer was partially blind a certified 
statement from an eye doctor must be attached to the return the 
attachment must state that the taxpayers vision cannot be 
corrected with glasses or contacts to be better than 20200 in the 
better eye or that the taxpayers field of vision is 20 degrees or 
less 
medicare surtax 
finally for taxpayers eligible for medicare congress repealed 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act in december because the 
1989 tax forms were published before the repeal lines are included 
on the form that reflect the supplemental medicare surtax line 54 
on form 1040 and line 23 on form 1040a in filling out the return 
taxpayers may leave the line blank or fill it in with a zero 
if taxpayers already have made payments through additional 
estimated tax payments or additional withholdings they are 
entitled to a refund even if no income tax is owed a return must 
be filed to get a refund 
a credit for amounts paid through withholding can be claimed by 
reflecting those amounts on line 56 of form 1040 or line 25a of 
form 1040a the additions made through estimated tax payments can 
be shown on line 57 of form 1040

summer or winter outdoors or in what 
is gardening without a tomato 
growing a tomato under lights is easy if you youve got space 
the right plant and can wait 100 days my wife kindly let me have 
space in her area of our fluorescent stand to let me raise my first 
indoor tomato 
why would anyone want to do this i cant answer for others but 
i got a big sense of accomplishment out of seeing the blossoms come 
and the fruit set enlarge and finally redden ive raised a string 
bean indoors but the thrill was nowhere the same perhaps its 
because of americas special relation to tomatoes perennially 
voted our favorte garden vegetable 
for 35 years or so my wife and i have shared a custombuilt 
fourtiered stand along a wall of our dining room she has the deep 
middle shelves for flowers and leafy plants and i occupy the 
shallower top and bottom tiers for winter salad greens and for 
starting seeds in spring we try to keep out of each others way 
then a couple of years ago i saw a newspaper article saying 
windowsill tomatoes using sunlight are easy with certain 
varieties why not under fluorescents i asked my wife who 
knowing it would mean intrusion on her turf surprisingly said 
all right go ahead 
i tried two of the recommended varieties pixie and subarctic 
both of which had already done well in my outdoor garden theyre 
small tomatoes bearing early and abundantly subarctic has a 
particularly interesting past its an offspring of international 
tests including soviet trials in siberia to develop 
coldresistant varieties canadians even bred one to fruit on 
hudson bay 
in my fluorescent adventure i was faced with the problem that 
the tubes are infinitely weaker than sunlight while i raise tomato 
seedlings under lights every year growing plants to fruiting stage 
was a different challenge 
i started both tomoatoes early in january in flats of potting 
soil keeping them very close to the lights an inch or so so that 
the newly sprouting seedlings would not get leggy i kept notes on 
the progress of each 
by jan 28 subarctic was about eight inches tall while pixie 
was only three on jan 31 i transplanted one subarctic and one 
pixie into sixinch pots subarctic blossomed feb 24 and set its 
first fruit march 8 this turned red the week of april 12 and i ate 
it april 20 about 100 days after i sowed the seed sweet and nice 
from then until the end of july this plant produced a dozen 
tomatoes all a deeper red than their outdoor version and sweeter 
too it seemed to me 
subarctic ran away with the show pixie grew into a sturdy 
plant but never blossomed under the lights finally i planted it 
outdoors in june and it started blossoming almost immediately in 
the sun producing its first red fruit july 28 
during their indoor careers i sometimes forgot to water the 
plants until i noticed they were drooping then i rushed to the 
rescue with a longnosed watering can and they picked up right 
away i fertilized occasionally with a soluble plant food 
subarctic grew over a couple of feet tall and i tied it to the 
stand its upper reaches meandered along the lights and my wifes 
gloxinias and i had to trim it occasionally since then ive 
found a variety named florida petite that grows only a foot tall 
out of fourinch pots and requires no sacrifices from my wife 
my original experiment needed no unusal skills or horticultural 
heroics but in a long gardening career nothing has quite matched 
the special pleasure of watching that first red fruit complete its 
voyage to maturity under my dining room tubes

dan rostenkowski is a comfortable old 
politician a powerful house committee chairman with a huge staff 
a doting legion of lobbyists and a million bucks in his campaign 
chest with no challenger in sight 
maybe thats the kind of pol it takes to kick new life into a 
budget debate which until now has produced only stalemate and 
fiscal chicanery 
the illinois democrat known more for his clout than his daring 
last week entered the seemingly hopeless budget struggle with a 
splash to eliminate the 100 billionplus federal deficits he 
called on all sides to abandon their longheld positions his 
advice includes 
president bush raise income taxes 
democrats cut social security 
pentagon reduce spending 
bureaucrats freeze programs 
lobbyists the store is closed 
its what some call a gore everyones ox strategy to the 
tune of 500 billion over five years 
the proposal to freeze social security costofliving 
adjustments seems a thumbed nose to the elderly who offended by 
rostenkowskis support of the nowdefunct catastrophic health care 
plan attacked his car last year the domestic spending freeze 
tells fellow democrats to forget about spending any peace 
dividend from defense cuts made in the wake of the eastern 
european revolution 
by ruling out any tax cut rostenkowski rejects an idea 
popularized in his own party by sen daniel p moynihan dny 
who suggests cutting social security taxes rather than using the 
revenue to cut the deficit 
some within my own party decided they should fight 
irresponsibility with irresponsibility rostenkowski said 
rostenkowski began selling the plan this past weekend in 
speeches before some of the very interest groups who have made his 
life so comfortable with generous speaking fees and campaign 
donations 
the question is whether i can convince you that deficit 
reduction and a healthy economy are more important for your 
business than such special incentives as tax breaks he told the 
midcontinent oil and gas association 
rostenkowskis proposal to raise income taxes on the wealthy 
isnt just a challenge to bush it also abandons his own efforts to 
protect the 1986 tax reform bill that probably will be cited as 
the most sweeping achievement in rostenkowskis three decades in 
congress 
in an interview rostenkowski pushed aside questions seeking a 
personal agenda in his plan 
youve got to accept the fact that im viewed as the chairman 
of the committee that has 75 percent of the deficitreduction 
legislation in its jurisdiction he said 
im supposed to provide some leadership or some cover i 
just felt my colleagues would expect this of me he said 
rostenkowski was not too modest to suggest that he might provide 
some leadership for bush many of us felt that president bushs 
commitment to no new taxes was only a oneyear commitment he 
said 
distrust is the biggest obstacle to a deficitreduction plan 
this year he said that distrust has a long history 
many in congress both democrats and republicans proposed 
similarly daring plans in the mid1980s the republicans lost 
control of the senate after their 1985 budget proposed social 
security cuts and former house speaker jim wright was vilified for 
proposing tax increases while congress was getting a pay increase 
like others before him rostenkowski says there is the basis 
for doing something like this if everyone will step forward at the 
same time so far rostenkowski is marching alone 
bush greeted the plan with enough rhetorical warmth to keep it 
alive but refused to compromise his positions loyal house 
republicans portrayed it as another example of democrats wanting to 
raise taxes 
rostenkowskis democratic colleagues meantime praised him as 
brave but called his plan unrealistic until bush changes his tune 
some were distrustful of rostenkowskis chummy relationship with 
bush 
everyone is suspicious of the president rostenkowski said 
without bushs overt support rostenkowski concedes any deficit 
reduction plan is dead but he believes the president blinked a 
little bit this time 
rumored to be considering retirement rostenkowski seems worried 
about his generations legacy a legacy thus far of debt and a 
declining standard of living and he hopes bush and the senior 
members of congress also are worried enough to go to camp david 
and stamp something out that both republicans and democrats 
could accept 
where others see only deadlock rostenkowski sees potential for 
compromise and progress maybe he thinks he has the right 
combination of skill clout and personal security to win and 
maybe just by shaking up a moribund debate he already has

nearly seven weeks after the national made a 
splashy debut central new jersey commuters are finding they can 
sleep in and still get a copy of the daily sports newspaper for 
their 40mile train ride to new york 
john giorgianni owner of the bottom of the hill newsstand in 
suburban new brunswick nj said he routinely ends up with 30 or 
more unsold copies these days in the days after the newspapers 
jan 31 premiere laterising commuters often found the paper was 
sold out 
those first three weeks were phenomenal giorgianni said 
the newspapers executives say they anticipated a falloff in 
circulation after the papers launch and insist that circulation 
and ad sales are matching their expectations they plan to boost 
distribution by 40 percent soon by making the paper available at 
more outlets around its first three markets new york chicago and 
los angeles 
but media analysts say it is too soon to say whether the 
national can survive in the publishing big leagues they want to 
see how it handles expansion beyond its current markets and whether 
it can command a steady readership 
publisher peter price said the national is selling about 200000 
of the 250000 copies it prints every day matching the target set 
for the paper 
the paper which costs 50 cents a copy is distributed sunday 
through friday and plans are to add six to 12 more cities by dec 
31 when price hopes a half million copies will be distributed 
every day 
advertisers have been told the national will start printing a 
second edition this week with a deadline three hours earlier than 
normal so papers can be distributed the next morning on newsstands 
further away from the centers of its three markets 
price confirmed that he hopes to soon begin printing about 
75000 copies a day of the twilight edition and to increase the 
regular edition by 25000 copies boosting total distribution to 
350000 
the twilight edition will enable the national to be available 
for the morning rush hours in places like eastern long island 
atlantic city nj milwaukee springfield ill and santa 
barbara calif price said 
media analysts say circulation confirmation from independent 
auditing agencies is not yet available leaving advertisers to rely 
on the papers word and anecdotal evidence of how things have been 
going 
they tell us they are meeting or exceeding their circulation 
guarantees said andrew white a spokesman for philip morris 
inc which advertises marlboro and parliament cigarettes in the 
national 
white said philip morris still wants to see if the paper is a 
truly national publication and whether circulation falls off on 
certain days of the week 
richard mader president of mader news a newspaper distributor 
in culver city calif said i was originally skeptical that 
people were going to buy it six days a week 
but the numbers are consistent through the week there is just 
a shift to different places on weekends he said 
skeptics argued before the nationals launch that people already 
get enough sports information from their local newspapers and would 
soon give up trying to wade through a 40 to 48page sports daily 
the jury is still out on readership said joseph ostrow 
worldwide media director for the advertising agency foote cone 
belding communications 
the amount of advertising in the newspaper has been fairly 
light dropping off from doubledigits in the first week to an 
average of four to five pages a day recently but price said that 
too was expected 
the paper has had some early editorial gaffes a cover photo 
from a college basketball game for instance misidentified one of 
the key players an item on the university of miamis bill foster 
was accompanied by a photo of a coach with the same name from 
northwestern the wrong box scores have appeared with game stories 
price said a dozen copy editors were added to the staff when it 
became evident there were too few to handle the late nights six 
days a week 
he is especially proud of the papers coverage of the unexpected 
defeat of heavyweight boxer mike tyson late on a saturday night 
one potential threat evaporated late sunday night when baseball 
owners and players agreed on a new fouryear labor contract ending 
a 32day spring training lockout and averting a strike that 
threatened the season 
baseball has no widely followed college counterpart unlike pro 
football and basketball before the settlement editorinchief 
frank deford had said he didnt think readers would want regular 
coverage of minor league or japanese baseball as a replacement if 
there were a major league strike 
however price had said that if there were a strike the paper 
could cut back to 32 pages and insisted the lack of baseball would 
not be life threatening 
what would kill the national it remains unclear how much 
backers of the paper mainly the mexican publisher emilio 
azcarraga are willing to lose 
price is optimistic 
we expected the launch would cost us 2025 million and that 
is what it has cost us we are tracking our plan he said

the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged more 
than 1300 points in massive selling monday its third biggest 
singleday fall ever and closed at a 14month low 
the dollar continued to rise against the japanese yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which fell 
5520 points last friday plunged 135320 points or 415 percent 
on monday its closing of 3126324 was the lowest since it closed 
at 3117038 on jan 20 1989 
the only bigger singleday declines were 383648 on oct 20 
1987 in the worldwide black monday stock market crash and 
156910 points on feb 26 this year 
in mondays early trading the index initially rose 105 points 
as investors were encouraged by last fridays gains on wall street 
dealers said 
but this was followed by a sharp decline in late morning 
the anxiety about the interest rate hike coupled with the weak 
yen against the dollar are the main causes of todays fall said 
ichitaro watanabe a dealer with nikko securities co the market 
as a whole appears very pessimistic about the current situation and 
i have heard that there was some panic selling 
he said a sharp fall in index future prices also triggered 
massive selling on the spot market 
meanwhile the dollar closed at 15355 yen up 105 yen from 
last fridays close of 15250 yen after opening at 15248 yen it 
ranged between 15235 and 15380 yen 
currency dealers said the dollar rose against the yen even 
though the american currency was sold against the west german mark 
after conservatives impressive showing sunday in east germanys 
first free elections in 41 years 
the conservative alliance led by the christian democrats a 
sister party of west german chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democratic union won the biggest single bloc of seats the east 
german christian democrats favor speedy reunification of the german 
states 
masaaki tanahashi a dealer with mitsui bank said that apart 
from the west german marks strength against other major 
currencies support for the dollar against the yen still remains 
firm 
but tanahashi said some market players were waiting to see if 
japans central bank as speculated would decide this week to 
raise its official discount rate from the current 425 percent 
japanese media have speculated for weeks that the bank of japan 
would raise its key lending rate charged for loans to commercial 
banks by as much as one percentage point this would affect other 
domestic interest rates

greyhound and its striking drivers 
exchanged barbs after negotiations broke down when company 
officials charged that union leaders failed to negotiate and were 
stepping up the violence 
union leaders presented a new contract proposal in talks held in 
tucson on saturday but the company said it was unacceptable 
negotiations broke off sunday after only about an hour 
a federal mediator said he is disappointed but not surprised 
that the first negotiations in the 18dayold greyhound bus 
drivers strike quickly broke off 
the issues remaining are serious and they are many and its 
not unusual at this stage of negotiations for both sides to remain 
very firm in their position said paul f stuckenschneider 
greyhound and union officials were less diplomatic 
there is no way to reach an agreement with people who are 
trying to break down the company through intimidation violence and 
terrorism the companys executive vice president anthony 
lannie said in a statement sunday 
they had nothing new for us today or yesterday while stepping 
up the violence lannie said there were a halfdozen new acts 
of terrorism yesterday while we were in the meeting 
in washington jeffrey nelson a spokesman for the amalgamated 
council of greyhound local unions said lannies statement sounds 
to me like the desperate words of a desperate man 
we clearly condemn violence and anything we can do to 
discourage our members we are doing so nelson said 
unions representing 6300 drivers and an estimated 3000 other 
greyhound workers walked out march 2 over wages job security and 
grievance procedures 
greyhound operates the only nationwide intercity bus service 
and the strike has stranded many smaller communities for which 
buses are the only public transportation 
the company said it has been operating roughly onethird of its 
buses with replacement and nonstriking drivers with about 400 
union drivers joining 1000 permanent replacements on the job the 
union says fewer than 100 of its drivers have crossed the picket 
lines 
greyhound officials said there have been at least 14 shooting 
attacks on greyhound buses 46 bomb threats and numerous other 
incidents of vandalism or threats during the walkout 
one new report of strikerelated violence involved a union vice 
president accused of striking a driver in fayetteville nc 
cumberland county nc magistrate sam mathis issued a warrant 
saturday for the arrest of fred ingram of charlotte nc accusing 
him of assaulting greyhound driver stanley harvey 57 of 
jacksonville fla 
ingram who is also president of a local in charlotte denied 
striking anyone 
steve scarpino a greyhound spokesman in dallas said other new 
complaints involved harassment by pickets in mobile ala an 
assault on a driver in tulsa okla and damaged buses in tucson and 
phoenix 
in an earlier incident driver edwin j ludwigsen 46 of spring 
lake nc said he was struck on the hee by a man o 
bgistratwissmoua criminalpummos for william daniysfghom 
greyhound said was a union member 
in florida on sunday the state patbol arrested the drivers of 
tree vehicles that surrounded a new yorktomiami greyhound bus on 
interstate 95 near fort pierce and forced it to slow down no one 
on the bus was hurt scarpino said 
union officials said their proposal involved a 40 million 
threeyear package that included modest pay increases of 4 percent 
to 5 percent and the addition of new drivers to the pension plan 
a union spokesman said the company has offered a plan that 
included no guarantee of ny pay hikes but would have made raises 
contingent onincreased profits and ridership 
lannie said the union is stonewalling on contract talks 
but union president edward m strait said greyhound never came 
to the bargaining table in good faith and refused to make an 
compromises any concessions from their previous unacceptable 
proposals 
stuckenschneider said he was not giving up on the negotiations 
we hoped to have stayed longer but were not discouraged 
he said we hope to be back very soon

another wall street creditrating firm gave 
massachusetts the lowest bond rating in the nation today a move 
that could make borrowing more expensive for the state 
moodys investors service inc said the lowered rating reflects 
massachusetts continued inaction in dealing with its fiscal crisis 
the rating on its bonds was dropped to baa from baa1 although 
it is still considered investment grade 
standard amp poors corp another rating firm had placed 
massachusetts below every other state in the nation last year sampp 
reaffirmed its bbb rating last week 
bond ratings give investors a quick reference to determine the 
degree of risk on an investment the lower the rating the higher 
the risk involved 
a low bond rating means the state may have to pay higher 
interest rates on the money it borrows 
todays announcment coincides with the states plans to go to 
market with 360 million in longterm bonds for capital projects 
sometime this week 
george leung a moodys analyst noted the states 1990 deficit 
has grown from an original estimate of 500 million to more than 
700 million 
extended inaction this fiscal year has reduced confidence that 
responsible action will be taken to contain this problem leung 
said in a statement 
leung also noted that the states economy has softened in 
addition to slowed revenues in fiscal 1990 the states 
unemployment rate recently rose to the national average of 53 
percent in february

foreign exchange rates which some analysts believe could encourage

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
declined by 15 this week as it continued on its normal first 
quarter pace to total 908 baker hughes inc reported monday 
the decrease in rig activity conforms to previous first quarters 
when the count generally is in a decline according to ike kerridge 
jr an economist for baker hughes 
the yeartodate count however remains well ahead of the 1989 
tally when 740 rigs were working baker hughes said 
last week the count rose by 29 to total 923 with texas heading 
other oil producing states with a gain of 30 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
this week texas saw the largest decline with 15 followed by 
oklahoma 11 louisiana two and new mexico ohio and 
pennsylvania one each

are americans buying houses at the expense of 
their homes 
the question is not as foolish as it might seem especially if 
you accept the definition of a house as a mere physical structure 
and a home as a spiritual haven and family environment 
pressured by prices that take a bigger chunk of paychecks than 
they used to both husband and wife must work to finance the house 
leaving too little time to develop the house as a home 
the consequences arent limited to the immediate family but are 
showing up as increased demands on employers and their benefits 
structure 
some businesses say the situation results in more absences and 
in stressrelated illnesses although definitive statistical 
evidence has yet to be developed the suspicion is that health 
insurance costs are being driven up 
businesses in areas where good employees are hard to find are 
either installing or contemplating daycare facilities maternal 
leave time is a standard paragraph in employment contracts 
paternal leave time is growing 
in turn critics of parental leave say it is an important factor 
in the slow growth of productivity in the american workplace they 
are preparing to counter what seems to be growing sentiment in 
congress to make it mandatory 
the national federation of indpendent business for example 
claims that mandated parental or maternity leave will prove too 
expensive for smaller companies and may discourage them from hiring 
potential parents 
whatever the problems or potential problems housing and real 
estate people suggest they arise from the fact that houses today 
often are priced so high that it takes the financial capability of 
both spouses 
citing a study by the chicago title and trust co which 
provides title insurance on houses the national association of 
realtors says the great majority of buyers last year were 
twoincome families 
the chicago study indicated that 793 percent of all couples 
buying houses last year relied on two incomes among firsttime 
buyers the percentage was 868 percent and even among repeat 
buyers it was nearly 75 percent 
the impact on family life is bound to be the of subject of 
growing study and controversy 
for one thing various other studies suggest that even todays 
socalled liberated women often are unable to reduce their load of 
household chores because men have not been sharing them that is 
women go to work and come home to work 
the consequences raise various possibilities among them that 
the effect will be felt in the emotional and phsyical health of 
children and in the quality of marital relationships 
business is watching the situation carefully fearful that 
congress will force parental leave into the cafeteria of employee 
benefits the national federation says it would make employees wary 
of hiring young married women 
just as important is the impact dual employment might be having 
on health care costs business in general is trying to reduce its 
benefits bill partly by shifting more of the cost to the employees 
but while business worries it is conceivable that the more 
serious cost to society might have less to do with business and 
more to do with the home

in the late 1980s columbia savings 
and loan television ads showed a man in a suit standing high atop a 
graph lines on the chart zigzagged up to demonstrate the companys 
growth and strength 
id say things are headed in the right direction the 
pitchman said 
if the ads ran now the guy might have to stand in a junkyard 
a metaphor not only for columbia but also for other california 
sampls that diversified away from homemortgage lending during the 
deregulated frenzy of the last decade 
a third of the states 21 biggest thrifts are in danger of 
failing even in a state economy that is one of the largest and 
healthiest in the world 
why are so many california thrifts sick 
a big reason is bad investments made under deregulation 
columbias years of success for example were built on 
investments in junk bonds securities that paid high interest 
because they funded risky ventures many were sold by drexel 
burnham lambert incs junk bond purveyor michael milken to his 
friend and ally columbia chairman thomas spiegel 
columbias heap of junk far bigger than any other thrifts has 
fallen in value by at least 800 million because of that the sampl 
no longer meets federal standards for capital reserves its cash 
cushion against risk 
spiegel has resigned drexel is in bankruptcy court milken is 
indicted the market for the risky securities he helped pioneer has 
collapsed 
columbias new president edward harshfield is trying to sell 
the whole 35 billion junk bond package many observers dont 
think he can 
i just have a feeling columbia may be too far gone said 
bert ely an alexandria vabased financial industry consultant 
the no 2 junk bond investor san diegos imperial savings and 
loan was seized feb 23 the same day regulators took over 
huntington beachbased mercury savings mercury had many problems 
but fell into insolvency partly because of another bugbear for 
california thrifts a risky outofstate loan 
the number of thrifts in california boomed in the early 1980s 
after federal and state laws were loosened permitting sampls to make 
a range of investments unlike banks they originally had been 
allowed only to make loans for houses 
california has about 12 percent of the countrys population but 
29 percent of the sampl assets 
the state hasnt suffered the economic shocks of texas and other 
energy states which could partly blame the skidding oil business 
for their sampl problems or arizona where thrifts were buried when 
real estate prices slumped 
analysts regulators and industry officials instead blame shoddy 
managers who courted big depositors with high interest rates and 
made illconceived investments well beyond the golden states 
borders besides junk bonds california thrifts put money into duds 
ranging from stud horses to yugo cars 
honcho thrift entrepreneurs with little experience used their 
newfound license to write not just adjustable rate loans but 
commercial and industrial loans loans on vacant land all that 
goofy stuff california sampl commissioner william crawford said 
making matters worse many conservative lenders followed suit 
often trying to recoup losses from early fixedrate mortgage loans 
made at low rates a lot of the good monkeys copied the bad 
monkeys crawford said 
crawford and marion sandler president of world savings and loan 
association said trying to do business outside the state was the 
biggest problem 
first you dont know the territory and second youre the 
latest pigeon she said 
many california thrift managers wrongly assumed every market was 
as good as california said alex sheshunoff the head of an austin 
texasbased firm that tracks the thrift industry 
they thought they had geographical risk diversification 
sheshunoff said what they wound up with was a piece of every bad 
deal no matter where it was 
some of the more prominent thrifts that ventured outofstate 
include great american savings bank of san diego now seeking an 
investor or buyer after losing 124 million in 1989 largely 
because of commercial lending in arizona 
great westerns 1989 profits fell 60 percent because of a 200 
million reserve for losses on commercial realestate loans most of 
them outside california the company is regarded as healthy 
nonetheless 
irvinebased lincoln savings the notorious thrift that 
regulators say will cost 2 billion to bail out lost money on 
arizona real estate and junk bonds it is the biggest sampl collapse 
so far 
mercury said a soured loan on a hotel in tulsa okla helped 
push it into insolvency with assets of 216 billion it had a 
negative net worth of 33 million when seized 
san diegos imperial had assets of 97 billion and a negative 
net worth of 60 million when regulators seized it besides big 
junk bond holdings imperials problems included shaky car loans 
and backing the importer of the yugo a car us drivers shunned 
ely attributes many of the problems to simply too many sampls with 
too few solid franchises 
theres parallels to the steel industry said ely what 
were doing is trimming away obsolescence its the same trend 
you see in any mature industry

ual corps unions and biggest shareholder today 
announced a joint effort to replace directors of the airline 
company and buy it for more than 38 billion 
the offer which included a nostrike commitment shattered a 
lull in the prolonged takeover maneuvering for the parent of united 
airlines and was about 40 percent less than a debtfinanced deal 
that collapsed five months ago 
that collapse touched off a major tumble in the stock market and 
raised the first big doubts about the future of the corporate 
takeover craze of the 1980s 
coniston partners a new york takeover firm that has invested in 
ual and long demanded changes to boost the stock price disclosed 
details of the joint plan with the pilots machinists and flight 
attendants unions of the chicagobased airline the second largest 
in the country behind american airlines 
it said they plan to lobby for shareholder proxy votes in favor 
of electing a new slate of directors at the ual april 26 meeting 
and the directors will attempt to force the company to agree to the 
takeover proposal 
stockholders will receive 150 in cash and 25 in securities as 
well as nonvoting common stock amounting to 25 percent of the 
total in the company the proposal stated the unions would own the 
remaining 75 percent 
based on uals 218 million shares outstanding the offer would 
be worth about 38 billion 
ual was trading at about 14250 a share on the new york stock 
exchange before the announcement then shot up to 150 by midday 
the shares have traded as low as 121 
stephen m wolf chairman of the company said in a statement 
that the board of directors was prepared to consider the 
conistonunion proposal and would meet promptly to discuss it as 
well as other unspecified alternatives 
it was unclear how coniston and the unions intended to finance 
the takeover but their announcement said new labor agreements 
would be negotiated that would include nostrike commitments and 
result in substantial labor cost savings 
the collapse of a debtfinanced 300ashare offer for ual on 
oct 13 is considered one of the major events in the era of 
corporate takeovers because it instilled deep skepticism about 
whether such deals would continue the dow jones industrial average 
plunged 190 points that day 
the subsequent collapse of the junkbond market practically 
stopped all takeover deals because it eliminated the major source 
of financing takeovers for airlines in particular are now 
considered riskier because of uncertainty about the economy and the 
overall health of the airline industry 
ual has attracted widespread interest because the unions have 
been leading an effort to take control and play a crucial role in 
any takeovers chances of success the machinists balked at the 
original takeover proposal and contributed to its downfall

the government presents its budget tuesday against 
a background of inflation and high interest rates that are 
threatening prime minister margaret thatchers prospects for 
reelection 
chancellor of the exchequer john major is not expected to 
produce any radical changes in his speech to parliament outlining 
the fiscal year ending march 1991 but he is expected to try and 
boost confidence in his existing tight monetary policy which has 
squeezed consumers and raised fears of recession 
base interest rates have risen to 15 percent sending home loan 
costs soaring while an unpopular new property tax that takes 
effect next month will raise many homeowners bills by a third 
inflation is 77 percent already the highest among the major 
industrialized nations and is forecast to rise to 9 percent the 
pound has weakened and the nations 1989 trade deficit was 34 
billion 
a tight budget likely will worsen mrs thatchers standing 
while economists fear it wont be tight enough to wring out 
stubborn inflation raising taxes would curb consumers ability to 
spend 
my view is that we need a very tight budget indeed said 
keith skeoch chief economist at the london investment firm james 
capel and co 
the spring budget statement outlines the governments revenue 
raising plans and is a principal platform for announcing economic 
policies and forecasts 
the government details its spending plans in an autumn 
statement last november major said spending would reach 179 
billion pounds the equivalent of 288 billion in the coming year 
critics say the economy overheated because of the 1988 tax cuts 
devised by thenchancellor nigel lawson lawson eliminated four of 
six tax brackets cutting the basic rate from 27 percent to 25 
percent and the top rate from 60 percent to 40 percent 
the cuts partly were aimed at preventing a recession after the 
1987 global stock market crash but since then the government has 
pushed up interest rates 11 times to double their decadelow 75 
percent of june 1988 
the hikes are intended to curb inflation which has more than 
doubled to 77 percent since january 1988 
there are fears that high interest rates might topple britain 
into a recession after eight straight years of economic growth 
major says britains economic growth should slow to 125 percent 
from 2 percent last year 
these are setbacks for the conservative government which took 
credit for curing the british disease of high interest rates 
and inflation 
now mrs thatcher who must call an election by mid1992 faces 
doubts about her economic stewardship 
the strategy has patently failed to work weve gone to a 
situation where a recession is almost necessary to slow 
inflation skeoch said 
gavyn davies a british economist with goldman sachs 
international said i think its working yes 
but it no longer looks like a thatcher economic miracle 
just last week the government reported that retail sales rose 
24 percent in february to an alltime high of 15 billion despite 
the higher interest rates 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party claimed mrs 
thatchers policies are failing to manage demand they are 
increasing inflation they are decreasing manufacturing investment 
and they are clobbering every homebuyer in the country because of 
mortgage rates 
but the government said such economic figures can be erratic 
that the retail sales growth was slower than last years 4 percent 
and that economic indicators point to a slowdown 
mrs thatcher told parliament the high interest rates are 
working but declined to give assurances that they wont go any 
higher 
pessimists fear the government again will raise interest rates 
to prop up the pound whose fall is worsening inflation prospects 
sterling is trading at about 161 compared with 187 in december 
1988 
the foreign exchange and stock markets have been jittery over 
the economy mrs thatchers declining popularity in opinion polls 
and violent protests against the new property tax 
however there are bright spots unemployment has fallen to 56 
percent in february from a peak of 115 percent in june 1986 the 
government has a budget surplus of 155 billion for the first 11 
months of its current fiscal year the strikes that plagued british 
industry in the 1970s virtually have disappeared 
former conservative party chairman norman tebbit told reporters 
last week that interest rates almost certainly will fall by the end 
of 1990 because the government will have to ease the pressure as 
the next election approaches

command communications inc said monday talks 
have ended on previously announced plans to sell radio stations in 
houston and dallas and a texaswide radio network for 865 million 
to evergreen media corp 
command said the decision reflects the continued strong 
performance of the properties and the brightening prospects for the 
texas economy 
the new yorkbased company said it had secured additional 
sources of both equity and bank financing and now plans to make 
acquisitions in texas and other markets 
scott k ginsburg president and chief executive of evergreen 
media of irving texas said he was disappointed that command and 
its principals have had a change of heart about this 
transaction 
command signed an agreement in january to sell krldam of dallas 
and the texas state radio networks to evergreen media for 585 
million 
under a separate deal evergreen would have acquired kodafm in 
houston for 28 million from the sillerman companies a new 
yorkbased investor in command and other broadcast properties 
at that time commands president and chief executive carl c 
brazell jr said in a news release that the purchase price gives 
us an opportunity to increase shareholder value 
ginsburg had said in january the deal would give evergreen 
which owns an fm radio station in dallas and five stations in four 
other cities a dominant position in dallas while moving it further 
along on its strategic growth plan 
but in announcing monday that the negotiations had ended 
brazell was quoted as saying in the final analysis we just 
couldnt part with such a strong regional franchise 
in a separate news release ginsburg said the january agreement 
called for evergreen to finance the 28 million koda purchase while 
command was to put in place 585 million in assumable debt related 
to the other transaction 
both companies were to contribute working capital to the 
krldtexas state radio networks entity ginsburg said 
he said evergreen received financial commitments from lenders 
and investors for the koda purchase but was unable to receive 
assurances of commands ability to secure the required assumable 
debt related to the purchase of the houston station and the radio 
networks 
be it financing problems or a new business agenda for command 
communications its now apparent that it will not be possible for 
evergreen media to proceed with these tranasctions ginsburg said 
krldam is an allnews station kodafm has a soft adult 
contemporary format and the texas state radio networks provides 
agribusiness and spanishlanguage programming and dallas cowboys 
football for stations across texas 
brazell and robert fx sillerman formed command communications 
in late 1988 
in a telephone interview sillerman said it had become more 
difficult to finance the transaction over the past six months 
while at the same time media prices have fallen as a result we 
are more interested in acquiring than selling he said 
he said the sillerman companies last week transferred its right 
to buy koda for 28 million to command in addition to the two 
texas radio stations and the radio networks sillerman said command 
owns kjqyfm radio in san diego

eastern airlines announced monday it was cutting 
first class fares by about 40 percent in an effort to attract more 
business travelers and was sweetening travel agent commissions for 
sales of the new cutrate tickets 
the lower fares called ynot fares are good for domestic 
travel through june 30 carry no penalties are fully refundable 
and can be booked up to flight time 
with the ynot fare you can buy them at anytime and fly at 
anytime said george brennan vice president of marketing for the 
miamibased carrier 
some industry analysts expressed surprise at the size of the 
fare cuts which put easterns firstclass tickets about 15 percent 
below the industrys full coach fares but they said they did not 
expect other carriers to immediately match or lower their rates 
its a marketing move a promotional program said robert 
decker analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago we might see some 
selective matching by other airlines but i wouldnt expect a 
widespread move at this point 
eastern is reorganizing under bankruptcy court protection from 
creditors where it sought protection following a crippling strike 
by pilots machinists and flight attendants a year ago 
decker said easterns success in emerging from bankruptcy 
depends on getting business travelers back in significant numbers 
theyre trying to get the business traveler back on and fill 
up the first class section which is probably flying empty right 
now decker said 
eastern claims its 9000 daily firstclass seats are 65 percent 
full although brennan conceded at a new york news conference that 
many passengers now flying first class on eastern are frequent 
flier passengers upgraded from coach 
current industry first class fares between new york and miami 
are 437 oneway while the lowest fullcoach fare is 333 
according to figures supplied by eastern the new ynot fare on 
that route is 276 one way 10 above easterns current fullcoach 
fare 
between chicago and atlanta the current firstclass oneway 
fare is 537 fullcoach is 360 and easterns ynot fare is 298 
eastern passengers with fullcoach fare tickets will be able to 
exchange their tickets for firstclass seats for 10 more 
easterns fullcoach fares the lowest in the industry are 10 
less than the ynot fares 
eastern said it expects the lower fares to generate about 
400000 a day more in net revenue the fares are good for travel 
in the united states puerto rico and the virgin islands 
andrew geller analyst with provident national bank in 
philadelphia said the increase in travel agent commissions will 
help eastern improve relations between the carrier and its travel 
agents 
standard commissions industrywide amount to about 10 percent 
eastern will boost the commissions on ynot tickets to 15 
percent 
many agents have been wary of putting customers on eastern 
because of the carriers financial problems 
some travel agents have not been booking on eastern for fear 
that in the future clients might get stranded geller said by 
doing this it tries to get around that fear

soybean futures prices rose sharply monday on the 
chicago board of trade amid talk of lowerthanexpected brazilian 
soybean yields and diminishing fears that brazils economic reforms 
will lead to a flood of soybean marketings 
on other commodity markets coffee sugar and cocoa futures fell 
sharply livestock and meat futures advanced petroleum futures 
were mixed and precious metals were higher 
soybean futures settled 6 cents to 8 cents higher with march at 
590 a bushel 
the soybean market opened lower on expectations that sweeping 
economic reforms announced last week in brazil the worlds 
secondlargest soybean producer would stimulate farmer sales of 
soybeans there 
of greatest concern was a plan to replace brazils currency the 
cruzado novo with a new currency the cruzeiro which would 
feature freefloating foreign exchange rates many experts believe 
the cruzeiro will be sharply devalued which would prompt farmers 
to sell soybeans to obtain dollars or other hard currency 
but analysts saw no significant increase in brazilian sales over 
the weekend or on monday said steve freed a grain market analyst 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
meanwhile analysts said memphisbased sparks commodities inc 
released an estimate of the brazilian soybean crop pegging 
production at 195 million metric tons instead of the 205 million 
projected last month by the us agriculture department 
sparks would not confirm the number but analysts said 
indications of lowerthanexpected brazilian soybean yields the 
harvest began about two weeks ago have prompted a great deal of 
speculation that the crop will be smaller than the usdas estimate 
the smaller the brazilian crop the less it will compete with 
our beans once we get into the new crop year at the beginning of 
september said anne frick senior oilseeds analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
wheat futures settled were 2 cents to 9 cents higher with march 
at 398 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 3 cents higher with march 
at 251 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with march 
at 148 a bushel 
selling linked to the brazilian economic reforms dominated the 
coffee cocoa and sugar markets brazil is a major producer of all 
three commodities 
on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange coffee futures 
finished 15 cents to 267 cents lower with march at 87 cents a 
pound sugar settled 02 cent to 26 cent lower with may at 1587 
cents a pound cocoa futures settled 20 to 36 lower with march at 
1095 a ton 
livestock and meat futures made strong gains on the chicago 
mercantile exchange largely in reaction to fridays monthly usda 
cattleonfeed report which showed more active feedlot marketings 
than traders had expected 
live cattle futures settled 42 cent to 78 cent higher with 
april at 7815 cents a pound feeder cattle were 23 cent to 37

ual corps unions and biggest shareholder 
announced a 38 billion buyout offer monday for the airline 
company a mostly cash deal worth about 40 percent less than a 
debtfinanced effort that collapsed five months ago 
ual chairman stephen wolf who helped lead last years 
illfated buyout deal issued a statement saying the board would 
consider the offer which shattered a lull in the maneuvering for 
the parent of united airlines 
the outcome could help determine the shape of takeovers in the 
tightmoney atmosphere that has prevailed since the collapse of the 
earlier 68 billion deal which contributed to a plunge in the 
stock market and raised some of the biggest doubts about the future 
of the corporate merger craze of the 1980s 
airline analysts said financing for the new bid could be a 
problem the depression in the junkbond market and demise of its 
pioneer drexel burnham lambert inc formerly a leading source of 
takeover financing also could present major obstacles 
coniston partners a new york investment firm that owns 118 
percent of uals approximately 218 million shares outstanding 
disclosed the plan with the united pilots machinists and flight 
attendants unions united is the nations secondlargest airline 
after american airlines 
coniston said the group plans to lobby shareholders for their 
proxy votes in favor of electing a new slate of directors at uals 
annual meeting april 26 
if they are successful the new directors will push for 
accepting the conistonunion takeover which will give uals 
employees including nonunion workers 75 percent ownership of 
the company 
the plan would pay stockholders 150 in cash and 25 in 
securities plus nonvoting common stock amounting to 25 percent of 
the total in the company for each of their shares 
based on uals 218 million shares outstanding the offer would 
be worth about 38 billion 
ual stock rose 12 to 15450 a share monday in new york stock 
exchange composite trading the shares have recently traded as low 
as 121 
keith gollust one of conistons three principal partners said 
in a telephone interview that they were undertaking the proxy fight 
because uals board was moving too slowly on conistons 
longstanding demand that the company be sold or restructured 
our decision to nominate a slate of directors in opposition to 
the incumbents was based on our disappointment that the board was 
unable to produce another transaction he said 
wolfs statement said uals board would consider the offer 
carefully and meet to discuss it along with unspecified 
alternatives for raising the value of ual shares no meeting date 
was announced 
it was unclear how coniston and the unions intended to finance 
the takeover they said the deal would include new labor 
agreements such as nostrike commitments and result in 
substantial labor cost savings 
airline analyst kevin murphy of morgan stanley amp co said the 
groups ability to obtain financing was the key to their plan 
its going to be hard for them to win a proxy fight unless 
they can show the shareholders theyve got some financial clout 
murphy said 
but jack hunter an airlines analyst with howe barnes 
investments inc said ual owns about 240 airplanes more than half 
of uniteds fleet that could be used as collateral to secure a 
large enough loan for the proposed deal hunter estimated the 
planes are worth 4 billion 
he predicted uals board would agree to a buyout and avoid a 
proxy fight 
i dont think theres going to be a war hunter said i 
think the board is ready to get out of this 
ual has been in a takeover target since early last august when 
los angeles investor marvin davis offered 43 billion for the 
company the pilotmanagement coalition eventually won a deal with 
its 300 a share 68 billion offer 
the oct 13 collapse of that offer which was to be financed 
largely with borrowed money was considered one of the major events 
in the era of corporate takeovers because it helped instill deep 
skepticism about whether such deals would continue the dow jones 
industrial average plunged 190 points that day 
the subsequent slump of the market for highinterest junk bonds 
widely used to finance buyouts helped curb the takeover frenzy 
airline acquisitions in particular have been considered risky 
because of uncertainties about the economy and health of the 
airline industry 
in january the three unions proposed an employee purchase of 75 
percent of ual and the board instructed its advisers to help the 
unions put together a formal bid 
the relationship soured when the union group indicated it 
planned to dump wolf the chairman has taken a hard line in labor 
negotiations and would have received 76 million in cash and a 10 
percent stake in ual as part of last years failed bid 
conistons buyout plan mirrors the firms attack on ual 
predecessor allegis corp in 1987 the firm acquired a stake in 
allegis and threatened to mount a takeover if the company did not 
divest its nonairline businesses which coniston believed were 
hindering corporate earnings and depressing the value of its 
shareholdings 
allegis ended up selling its hertz car rental westin hotel co 
and hilton international chains and renaming itself ual

oil futures prices ended mixed monday in fairly 
active trading as crude oil and gasoline continued the downward 
trend started last week 
crude oil pierced the 20 mark for the first time in more than 
three months as sellers went on a binge early in the session 
analysts said however prices recovered from their lows shortly 
after midday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the april contract for west 
texas intermediate the key grade of us crude oil fell 47 cents 
to close at 1960 a 42gallon barrel after sinking to 1944 
earlier in the session 
the nearterm contract last closed under 20 on nov 30 when it 
finished at 1989 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for april delivery which dropped 
111 cents at one point during the session ended 060 cent lower 
at 5636 cents a gallon 
theres just too much gasoline around said kevin breslin 
energy analyst with united energy inc and most of whats out 
there is premium the kind everybody wants 
meanwhile the april contract for no 2 heating oil rose 08 
cent to 5454 a gallon 
there are a lot of factors affecting prices right now 
including the selling trend last week due to high stocks and low 
demand and crude oil breaking through technical levels said 
peter beutel energy broker and analyst with elders futures inc 
analysts said demand for crude oil has fallen off sharply due 
partly to annual refinery maintenance when refineries slow 
operations and therefore use less crude oil to make products 
observers also attributed some of the early selloff to 
opecrelated jitters 
the fact that opec didnt do anything was another factor but i 
wouldnt put it at the top of the list beutel said 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries monitoring 
committee concluded a twoday meeting on saturday after reviewing 
current market conditions in advance of the full opec ministerial 
conference in may 
as expected the oil ministers adjourned without making any 
formal decisions on production despite the recent softening in 
prices and predictions of a further seasonal erosion in consumption 
during the second quarter

large bank holding companies have moved 
swiftly to take advantage of a loophole in the legal wall 
separating banking from the securities industry according to a 
congressional report 
bank holding companies under a regulation passed by the federal 
reserve board three years ago started underwriting a limited 
amount of some previously forbidden securities in the 
julyseptember quarter of 1988 
in that quarter four companies underwrote 123 billion in 
securities the general accounting office said in a report to the 
house banking oversight subcommittee 
by the julyseptember quarter of 1989 the latest period for 
which data was available 13 companies underwrote 687 billion up 
90 percent from the previous quarter and 460 percent from a year 
earlier 
ninetyeight percent of the securities involved were commercial 
paper shortterm debt issued by large publicly traded companies 
the figures also include municipal revenue bonds mortgagerelated 
securities and other assetbacked securities 
the gao said the bank activity represented about 19 percent of 
the combined markets in those securities 
another eight companies have gotten permission to receive 
underwriting what are termed ineligible securities but had not 
started yet the fed has also expanded the list of securities 
covered by the loophole to include corporate debt and is expected 
to soon approve the first bank underwriting of corporate stock 
the gao congress auditing and investigative agency said it 
was too soon to draw any conclusions about the profitability or 
riskiness of bank holding company affiliates involvement in 
securities 
so far the fed has limited the holding companies to deriving no 
more than 10 percent of their revenue from ineligible securities 
that restriction is in place to comply with the 1933 glasssteagall 
act 
the act separated commercial from investment banking in the wake 
of abuses thought to contribute to a wave of bank failures that 
followed the 1929 stock market crash 
next year congress is expected to reopen debate on whether and 
how to permit banks to move more broadly into the securities 
business

as the tokyo stock exchange took one of its worst 
beatings ever monday a senior bank of japan official reiterated 
that the central banks key concern was inflation adding fuel to 
expectations for higher interest rates 
rattled by a stronger us dollar and speculation that an 
interest rate hike was imminent the exchanges nikkei stock 
average plunged 135320 points on monday a 415 percent tumble 
that marked its third biggest daily decline ever the close at 
3126324 points was the lowest for the nikkei stock average since 
jan 20 1989 
the decline continued tuesday after a short upswing the nikkei 
was down 69129 points or 221 percent at 3057195 in early 
trading it was the first time the index dropped under 31000 even 
temporarily since jan 9 1989 
the nikkeis decline on monday was at least partly tied to the 
growing strength of the us dollar against the japanese yen which 
could help fuel inflation in japan 
the bank of japan has attempted to stall the dollars rise in 
recent months by selling billions of dollars in the currency 
markets 
there also is speculation that the central bank will hike its 
benchmark discount rate to support the yen and fight inflation 
in the stock market on monday many investors appeared to be 
selling shares as though a rate rise were imminent 
keiichi nishida of kidder peabody securities said because 
mondays drop was not the result of panic selling there is a 
widely shared fear in the market that share prices may fall even 
further until they really hit the bottom 
but at this point no one knows where the bottom really is 
he said 
the bank of japan official who spoke to reporters monday on 
condition of anonymity said the stock markets rapid rise last 
year set the stage for a downward correction he also said that 
if the market was having trouble finding its appropriate level it 
is due to political factors and speculation 
the official acknowledged that the correction which so far 
this year has cut nearly 20 percent from the nikkei average had 
been larger than anticipated but he reiterated that the central 
banks primary concerns were elsewhere particularly in controlling 
inflation 
the bank of japan official said that although the central bank 
cant create specific exchange rate levels its repeated 
intervention should influence the market over time 
nevertheless the dollar continued rising monday it closed at a 
threeyear high of 15355 yen up 105 yen from last fridays close 
dealers said the bank of japan made largescale interventions 
monday to stem the yens fall one dealer with daiichi kangyo bank 
said the central bank bought at least 1 billion worth of yen 
monday 
the yens prolonged weakness coupled with signs of inflation 
has convinced many stock and exchange market participants that 
another discount rate hike is looming higher interest rates tend 
to bolster the yen but depress stock prices 
the bank of japan official appeared to give credence to the view 
that the bank will raise its key rate soon admitting that the 
timing of the rate hike is difficult he said it may be too late 
to act when the indicators are flashing 
after several years of stability the bank raised the discount 
rate its interest on loans to commercial banks three times last 
year bringing it to 425 percent from 25 percent 
masaaki tanahashi a currency dealer with mitsui bank said some 
market players were hesitant to buy the yen until the bank of japan 
actually raises the discount rate 
the daiichi kangyo dealer who requested anonymity said i 
would not be surprised to see the dollar surpass the 154yen mark 
before the interest rate hike actually happens

the us dollar

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange was 
slightly lower at the close of morning trading tuesday in wide 
fluctuations following the thirdworst drop in its history 
the us dollar declined against the japanese yen the dollar 
ended the morning session at 15290 yen it opened at 15270 yen 
down 085 yen from mondays close at 15355 yen and ranged between 
15245 yen and 15355 yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average lost 15667 points or 050 
percent ending morning trading at 3110657 after wild ups and 
downs the nikkei gained more than 260 points after trading began 
then quickly plunged about 700 points 
the market is gradually recovering said kazuyuki suzuki a 
dealer with daiwa securities co 
he said news reports that the bank of japan might raise its 
official discount rate during lunchtime lent the market some 
support with the discount rate hike the market will recover at 
least temporarily because there is one less factor to worry 
about suzuki said 
japans central bank later raised its official discount rate by 
1 percentage point to 525 percent effective immediately the 
decision followed a meeting of the bank of japans special policy 
board 
the official discount rate is the interest rate the central bank 
charges on loans to commercial banks and has a strong impact on 
other interest rates 
in its thirdlargest singleday drop the nikkei on monday fell 
135320 points or 415 percent to 3126324 its lowest close 
since jan 20 1989 dealers attributed the plunge to a stronger 
dollar and the looming discount rate hike 
dealers said the index started higher tuesday as market players 
bought issues to make up their short or oversold positions after 
the plunge but they soon began selling shares again due to 
lingering pessimism following the dollars continuous surge 
in currency dealings the dollar was moving narrowly around the 
153yen level traders said 
despite the discount rate rumors the yen failed to rise as many 
market players bought the dollar near 15250 yen 
market players did not jump at the yen because they still 
think that the bank of japan may not raise its discount rate 
despite all these news reports said masato hayashi a bank of 
tokyo trader 
but he said dollarbuyers also were cautious in case of the 
discount rate hike 
the price of the benchmark no 119 japanese government bond was 
up from mondays close at 8650 its yield was quoted at 716 
percent down from the previous days 724 percent
