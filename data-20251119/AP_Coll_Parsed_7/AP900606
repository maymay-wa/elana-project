when landscape artist albert bierstadt 
painted a huge canvas of switzerlands lake lucerne in 1858 it was 
well documented in art literature within decades the painting was 
lost until now 
the 6by10foot painting was found two weeks ago in the rural 
exeter home of the late pearl rose whose family had owned but 
concealed the canvas for 100 years 
during the weekend experts used writings about the painting to 
confirm that the scene of the lake with the swiss alps in the 
background was bierstadts work said linda ferber curator of 
american painting at the brooklyn museum in new york 
its a piece of the bierstadt puzzle and its very nice to have 
it back in the public domain she said 
lewis peck who inherited the bierstadt said wednesday the 
family kept the painting a secret because they owned other artwork 
and did not want that generally known 
if you had a bar of gold in your house would you tell 
everybody about it he asked in a telephone interview from exeter 
in south central rhode island thats about the way we did 
things 
the whereabouts of the painting was last known in 1882 when alvin 
adams of watertown mass sold it in boston 
in 1890 it was purchased by mrs roses first husband william 
sunderland said pecks wife sylvia peck a distant cousin of mrs 
rose inherited it in august when she died at age 86 
the landscape is so large that when the family moved it to their 
exeter home 70 years ago the roof had to be lifted to get the 
painting in mrs peck said tuesday when it was removed two weeks 
ago we took the side of the house off she said 
the pecks will sell the painting at auction on oct 6 
the painting is typical of bierstadts earlier work according to 
ferber who is assembling an exhibit of bierstadts work for early 
1991 
ferber did not know what the lake lucerne painting was worth but 
attorney christopher healey said bierstadts moteratsch glacier 
upper engadine valley pontresina about the same size as the 
pecks painting brought 990000 at sothebys auction house may 24 
bierstadt part of the hudson river group of painters built his 
reputation on his panoramic landscapes of the american west 
the world book encyclopedia calls bierstadt one of the greatest 
american romantic landscape painters and said he received 25000 
for a painting in the latter half of the 1800s a record for a 
painting at that time 
bierstadt was born in germany and raised in new bedford mass he 
studied in dusseldorf germany from 1853 to 1857 and painted his 
lake lucerne picture in new york according to ferber 
she said there are other bierstadts that are unaccounted for 
although this was certainly one of the larger ones bierstadt 
died in 1902 in new york city

prime minister jozsef antall said 
wednesday he plans to tell soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
that the warsaw pact is out of step with the political times and as 
a military alliance should be dissolved by next year 
we intend to make it clear that the warsaw pact as a political 
organization reflecting confrontation in europe is outdated 
said antall only hours before departure for a key pact summit in 
moscow 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said tuesday that the 
pact would undertake a transformation at the moscow meeting and 
urged nato to do the same 
it has lost its function in europe antall said of the pact 
therefore its military aspect can be discarded and in our view 
dissolved by the end of 1991 
expanding on his proposal to transform the sevennation 
sovietled alliance into a nonmilitary pact antall told reporters 
it is to be attained through the helsinki process and the 
vienna disarmament talks 
the 35nation helsinki talks bring together all european nations 
except albania as well as the united states and canada to discuss 
various aspects of security and cooperation in europe the 16member 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact are meeting 
in vienna to discuss cutting conventional arms in europe 
antall hungarys first noncommunist prime minister in more than 
four decades served notice shortly after assuming office last month 
that he sought to pull his country out of the pact he reiterated 
wednesday however that hungary would only leave with the agreement 
of all its pact partners 
the intentions of the hungarian people were made clear in 
1956 he said alluding to the nations failed attempt to leave the 
pact during the antistalinist revolution that was crushed by soviet 
tanks 
but that does not mean we can disregard international law 
politics and military aspects he said arguing against a renewed 
attempt on hungarys part to leave unilaterally 
antall also said he saw no reason for natos disbanding 
unlike the warsaw pact nato is not in crisis he said 
therefore the dissolution of the nato military alliance is not 
linked to the question of the future of the warsaw pact 
antall indicated hungary would seek more independence within the 
military alliance as long as it remained a member 
we want to compile as soon as possible a list of all the things 
we feel impinge upon the sovereignty of member states he said 
such stipulations and confrontational elements must be struck from 
the treaty

the leader of bulgarias main opposition 
alliance tuesday predicted his group will take at least half the 
vote in the june 10 elections 
meanwhile the us embassy said ambassador sol polansky met in 
copenhagen with james a baker iii in response to a request by the 
us secretary of state to receive an assessment of the prospects 
for free and fair elections in bulgaria and in view of the 
increasing concern about the fairness of the electoral process 
baker and other foreign ministers of the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe are in denmark to attend a csce 
meeting 
udf chairman zhelyu zhelev made his electoral forecast in an 
interview after his alliance appeared to have suffered a setback 
because of controversial comments made by another opposition leader 
in the interview published in bulgaria and abroad milan 
drenchev head of the agrarian party nikola petkov was quoted as 
saying other udf leaders understand nothing about politics 
he reportedly announced his group would leave the opposition 
alliance after the june 17 runoff and would run independently in 
fall municipal elections 
officials of his party issued a denial tuesday and zhelev said 
drenchev was misquoted 
we believe we will win at least 50 percent we are aiming for 
more than that zhelev insisted despite widespread belief the 
ruling communists who now call themselves the socialist party 
would give the udf a close race 
he said attendance at recent opposition rallies was two to four 
times larger than that of comparable events organized by the ruling 
party 
while expressing confidence the voting process would be fair 
overall zhelev said he expects some attempts at manipulation 
the ruling party came to power with an election fraud with 
totally rigged elections in 1946 he declared it cannot 
reconcile itself with the thought of losing power 
western governments also have expressed interest recently in 
keeping the balloting fair 
apart from foreign observers of the voting including some from 
the united states other precautions have been taken the opposition 
leader said 
at least two udf representatives will be near each ballot box and 
free and fair election student activists will be posted in 1500 
polling stations about 10 percent of the total

the winds of change have forced reform on 
communists throughout europe but veteran leader alvaro cunhal is 
keeping his portugese party firmly to the traditional course 
our party continues to declare itself a marxistleninist 
party he told 2000 delegates to the groups congress last month 
in loures a communist bastion 12 miles from lisbon 
few of our comrades have expressed the opinion that the pcp 
should follow the path that other communist parties have trod 
cunhal said 
delegates raised clenched fists in salute and cheered their 
leader who is 76 and has led the party since 1961 they reelected 
him unanimously despite hints earlier this year that he might retire 
cunhals decision to stay on may worry the growing reform 
movement but the congress also chose carlos carvalhas a 
48yearold economist and member of the european parliament for the 
new post of assistant general secretary 
the combination of cunhal and carvalhas who is more pragmatic 
but not a member of the reformist wing may be an attempt to mend 
the rift between dissidents and the old guard 
reformers want the party to adapt its political program to 
reflect the new situation in eastern europe where the soviet bloc 
has collapsed and portugals position as a stable democracy within 
the 12nation european community they also demand greater democracy 
and openness in party operations 
party leaders have dealt firmly with dissenters 
zita seabra a leading campaigner for womens rights was 
expelled from the ranks in january after arguing for cunhals 
resignation a change in the party name and abandonment of 
traditional ideology 
jose luis judas a trade union official and leading critic of 
cunhal was barred from the loures congress other critics have been 
dismissed from the party central committee 
at the congress cunhal accused reformers of forming factions 
that act in a conspiratorial and organized way within the party and 
carrying out a media campaign that places their action in a wider 
anticommunist campaign against the party 
this will not be permitted he declared 
dissidents say only reform can halt a decline that has seen the 
partys share of the national vote drop from 21 percent in 1979 to 
14 percent in december when local elections were held 
some change has resulted from the fall of communist regimes in 
eastern europe cunhal acknowledges his former comrades commited 
serious errors and isolated themselves from their people 
he has paid lip service to the reforms of mikhail s gorbachev 
the soviet president but also said anticommunist forces backed by 
the west could compromise the building of socialism 
cunhals party supported the sovietled invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 and the kremlins intervention in 
afghanistan which lasted nearly a decade it was silent on the 
brutal repression of chinas prodemocracy movement a year ago and 
sent delegates to the romanian communist party congress before 
nicolae ceausescus downfall in december 
despite media reports of poor health cunhal demonstrated in two 
lengthy speeches to the congress that he had lost none of his fiery 
speaking style delegates in the loures hall of peace and 
friendship interrupted frequently with applause and chants of pcp 
pcp 
cunhal spent 12 years in prison under the rightwing dictatorship 
that governed portugal for nearly half a century before a coup in 
1974 opened the way for democracy 
his 40 years of resistance to the dictatorship years in jail and 
torture by the secret police earned cunhal legendary status among 
followers and the respect of political opponents 
judas said recently that cunhal would continue running the party 
even after retirement 
its a bit like deng xiaoping the senior chinese leader 
judas said even when he leaves the leadership its he who 
commands 
he said the party must change because in the future being a 
communist wont be the same thing as being a communist in 1917 
if the communist parties dont change adapt then theyll 
disappear

slovak nationalists who would 
like to create a separate state from the smaller of czechoslovakias 
two republics have campaigned aggressively and noisily for fridays 
elections the first free vote since 1946 
while their slovak national party is unlikely to finish higher 
than third in its native region their cause could become a major 
headache for the coalition governments likely to emerge at both 
federal and republican levels after the voting 
the chief task of the newly elected federal parliament in its 
twoyear term is to draft a new constitution deputies will have to 
address the thorny question of slovakias status 
all the parties campaigning in slovakia have adopted powerful 
local symbols slogans and heroes in election posters and ads 
the christian democrats frontrunners in slovakia although not 
nationwide say outright that they favor a shift from federation to 
a confederation that would loosen ties between two peoples whose 
languages are very similar but whose customs and history differ 
only foreign affairs defense and finance should be regulated at 
a national level in future said ivan carnogursky head of the 
slovak christian democrat movement 
according to his brother jan the christian democrats leading 
candidate in slovakia slovakia should ultimately enter a united 
europe as a separate state 
nobody is advocating a swift separation czech and slovak 
economies are too intertwined for that 
but the new freedom of speech and the full blast of an election 
campaign mean that ancient rivalry between the dominant czechs and 
the more rural slovaks who make up about onethird of 
czechoslovakias 155 million people is getting its fullest airing 
in more than 40 years 
in czechoslovakia a federation was formed in 1968 czechs 
resented it because it gave half the federal funds to a third of the 
people the 21year rule of gustav husak communist party chief 
later president and a slovak also brought an influx of slovaks to 
prague 
slovaks were not necessarily happy with what the federal money 
bought much of the industry devised by communist planners in the 
name of evening out economic inequities was unsuited to the rural 
region and blights the air and the eye around big cities such as the 
capital bratislava 
nationalist sentiment first broke out in spring when 
czechoslovakia decided to follow other newly liberated east european 
nations and remove socialist from the countrys name 
slovaks first insisted on a hyphen in the name to make a 
distinction between the czech and slovak regions thousands 
demonstrated angrily when the hyphen was not made obligatory in the 
czech republic 
the dispute eventually was settled by adopting the formal name 
czech and slovak federative republic for the country 
the clumsy solution pleased almost nobody and president vaclav 
havel a czech acknowledged that the name dispute had dispelled the 
euphoria engendered by last winters revolution 
about 500 slovak nationalists angrily disrupted havels final 
campaign appearance in bratislava on monday quieting down only when 
admonished by alexander dubcek the slovak hero of the 1968 prague 
spring he reminded them that totalitarianism had not been 
overthrown to make way for anarchy noting that democracy demanded 
they give the president a hearing 
earlier havel was interrupted several times during an appearance 
in southern slovakia at komarno 
latest opinion polls give the slovak national party just 7 
percent of the vote in the republic but in bratislava a 
centuriesold city with a tradition of more openness than slovakias 
sparsely populated mountains and valleys their support could go as 
high as 12 percent

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev may have 
returned to moscow bearing trade and arms agreements but he and his 
wife raisa were laden with other souvenirs as well including two 
of president bushs horseshoes 
among the many gifts the bushes gave the gorbachevs during the 
superpower summit was an orange pitching horseshoe mounted on a 
wooden plaque 
it was the lucky shoe that gorbachev had tossed for a firsttime 
ringer at camp david the presidential retreat in marylands 
catoctin mountains as he and his wife relaxed there last saturday 
with the bushes 
bush presented the horseshoe plaque to gorbachev at dinner that 
night 
but the next day a second horseshoe was discovered missing from 
the pit 
at first it wasnt clear what had happened but now the mystery 
has been solved 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday that 
mrs gorbachev who was with her husband when he pitched his ringer 
put the second horseshoe in her purse 
they took both he said 
fitzwater said mrs gorbachev had been invited to keep the second 
horseshoe which was the one that she had pitched by a bush aide 
the president later joked to members of his cabinet that 
gorbachevs visit had cost him two of his favorite horsehoes 
the horseshoeonaplaque gift was spontaneous a more formal 
exchange of gifts is part of every state visit 
considering how often bush meets with foreign leaders coming up 
with new gift ideas must strain the creativity of white house social 
planners 
the president gave gorbachev a fivevolume biography life of 
george washington by former chief justice john marshall in 
exchange the soviet leader gave bush an antique painting of russian 
birch trees 
mrs bush gave raisa gorbachev a goldandrhinestonetrimmed 
handbag in return she received an enameled tea set 
last year the gorbachevs gave the bushes a box of glass 
christmas ornaments and seven childrens books 
despite warming ussoviet relations american gifts to soviet 
leaders just arent what they used to be 
gorbachev got history books and a horseshoe former soviet leader 
leonid brezhnev was given a lincoln continental by thenpresident 
nixon at one of their summits 
sometimes gifts to and from foreign leaders can prove 
troublesome such as the two prized jaguars president andres 
rodriguez of paraguay gave vice president dan quayle earlier this 
year it turned out the cats were on the us endangered species 
list and no american zoo would take them 
quayle had to give them back he asked rodriguez to release them 
in the jungle 
and bush now may wish that he hadnt given leather cowboy boots 
bearing the flags of texas and china to chinese premier li peng he 
made the presentation when he visited beijing last year several 
months before government troops and tanks trampled prodemocracy 
demonstrators in tiananmen square 
us law permits federal officials from the president on down 
to keep gifts from foreign governments only with a value of 180 or 
less 
gifts worth more than that must be turned over to the state 
department for safekeeping 
barbara bush used to give a slide show when her husband was vice 
president when she would get to the slide of herself and the emir 
of bahrain she would tell audiences the agonized look on my face 
is because he had just given me 85000 worth of jewelry which i 
immediately gave to the state department 
it must be a coincidence but its remarkable how many public 
officials list gifts at just under that 180 threshold on their 
financial disclosure forms 
for instance vice president dan quayle and his wife marilyn gave 
these values on gifts from foreign governments in 1989 a picture 
and frame from the princess of thailand 170 a wooden carved bear 
from a highranking japanese official 175 a vase from the 
government of south korea 175 an engraved plate from el salvador 
175 
likewise white house chief of staff john sununu was able to keep 
the lacquered samovar two bottles of russian vodka and four ounces 
of black caviar that gorbachev gave him last year he valued the 
gifts at 173 
sig rogich assistant to the president for special activities 
got a like amount of caviar and vodka from gorbachev and an art 
book on impressionism as well his figured the combined value at 
178 
deputy national security adviser robert m gates reported 
receiving a cinnabar vase and wooden stand from the government of 
china he estimated their worth at 160 
fitzwater said there is a process under which foreign gifts worth 
more than 180 can be bought back from the government at auction 
but he said ill be honest with you ive pressed the state 
department for 25 years and have never been able to discover how in 
the world you do that 
as for himself fitzwater told reporters recently ive got a 
lacquered box from gorbachev thats my favorite gift i cant keep 
it because of the value but i can keep it on display in the white 
house so its in my office 
you can look at it any time you like he said

for millions of americans it will be a dream 
realized for organizers a logistical nightmare for eight chosen 
cities it will be a time of tumult for nelson mandela simply a 
welcome

plans an exultant tour of the united states this month starting 
with a new york tickertape parade and ending with a rally at the 
oakland calif coliseum 
organizers envision gatherings of uncommon size and emotion 
including throngs at yankee stadium in new york tiger stadium in 
detroit and the los angeles coliseum 
were asking that the people come to him said new york 
coordinator jim bell who is overwhelmed with requests for mandela 
appearances 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress will 
pick the fruits of political stardom as well hell meet with 
president bush speak to a joint session of congress address the 
united nations general assembly 
it is a very important political breakthrough one that 
simultaneously raises the ancs stature and pressures south africa 
to renounce apartheid its system of racial separation said anc 
spokesman victor mashabela 
for the anc he said all of this is powerful and positive 
it also is lucrative fundraising is one of mandelas goals and 
the anc south africas largest antiapartheid movement hopes to 
realize 8 million from the visit it will charge admission 5 to 
25 to the stadium concertrallies charge up to 25000 per plate 
at fundraisers with wealthy sympathizers even place donation cans 
to collect change in restaurants 
the african national congress has never had such a national 
massive campaign for raising funds in this country said suzanne 
dubose chief fundraiser for mayor david dinkins there has been 
a real outpouring of support and all of it is due to nelson 
mandela 
there also has been an outpouring of invitations school church

to a rally with mandela at a manhattan church 
the interest is a profound interest its an incredible 
interest its huge its from the grassroots right up to the ivory 
towers said carl mccaskill a tour spokesman the reason he 
suggested is that as nations other than south africa move toward 
democracy this is probably the last great opportunity to get 
involved in something like this 
some participants see the visit in intensely personal as well as 
historic terms as a black person it gives me great hope to see 
that this man is a hero to all people not just black people and 
south africans said colette phillips boston spokeswoman for the 
tour 
this is like for me the single most significant thing that i 
could do in my entire life she said if i died on june 24 the 
day after mr mandela leaves i would feel that my life would have 
been worth something i could say i have helped rid the world of the 
scourge of apartheid 
mandela 71 a lawyer grew to heroic stature as he languished in 
prison on a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
government he was freed feb 11 in a gesture of conciliation by the 
south african government which has legalized the anc and held talks 
with its leaders 
since his release mandela has traveled throughout africa and 
visited europe but this will be his first visit to the united 
states he arrives june 20 and departs june 30 with stops in new 
york boston washington atlanta miami detroit los angeles and 
oakland 
mandela underwent surgery last week to have a benign cyst removed 
from his bladder and tour organizers said they were concerned about 
his health and were intent on providing him with rests between 
appearances 
still his schedule and that of his wife winnie who will 
travel with him is arduous plans remain tentative but motorcades 
and stadium rallies are possible in each city mandela will meet 
with business leaders whom he will urge to boycott south africa 
until apartheid ends he will meet with civil rights leaders urging 
them to continue their antiapartheid efforts 
and in the midst of it all there will be a family affair in 
boston mandela will visit two of his daughters zenani 
mandeladlamini 31 and makaziwe mandela 36 both college 
students at a recent news conference dlamini worried that her 
parents would have scant time for the reunion

hungry for more studies analyzing the big 
issues of our time but tired of the predictable pap from 
established research organizations 
clyde prestowitz has just what you need a new think tank but 
in a town with a think tank on nearly every corner a new kid on the 
block has to find a niche 
according to its creators the economic strategy institute will 
be the first research organization geared to the postcold war era 
a time when americas standing will be based not on its nuclear 
arsenal but on its ability to compete economically with countries 
such as japan 
when you consider the question of international trade and 
international economics virtually all of the think tanks are saying 
the same thing prestowitz told a news conference tuesday 
we see a vacuum out there in terms of useful analysis to help 
guide policymakers in an era that will be dominated by geoeconomics 
rather than geopolitics he said 
we are going to be the think tank of the 90s the think tank 
for america said ronald a morse the institutes executive vice 
president 
the institute hopes to use its 14 million in donations from 
corporations labor unions and foundations to promote productivity 
and competitiveness two current buzzwords in a country plagued by 
fears of declining ability to measure up in the global marketplace 
given prestowitzs history it is likely that the institutes 
views will be controversial a topranking trade negotiator during 
the reagan administrations first term he later wrote a 
bestselling book on his experiences titled trading places how we 
are giving our future to japan and how to reclaim it 
prestowitz charged in his book that wrongheaded policies caused 
soaring trade deficits and suggested that instead of trying to 
americanize the japanese system us policymakers should copy 
japans approach of fostering homegrown industry 
critics have accused prestowitz of promoting an americafirst 
approach to policymaking that could topple the world into a round of 
trade wars and protectionist barriers killing off the freetrade 
principles that have guided us policy since the end of world war 
ii 
prestowitz says labels such as protectionist and free trade are 
too simplistic 
neither of those labels exist in the real world the reality 
is somewhere in between he said we are trying to challenge the 
old shibboleths 
to address the countrys lagging competitiveness prestowitz said 
government needs to boost woefully low business investment and to 
reorient american corporations toward longerterm objectives 
the committee hosting tuesdays inaugural dinner for the 
institute included house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
and senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
dole said he saw the new institute as a wakeup call to 
american leaders who seem to think that our economic strength can 
continue to erode without threatening our national security our 
prosperity and our very way of life 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher who has lost several battles 
inside the administration pushing for more economic support for us 
industry sent best wishes 
among the new institutes financial backers are ford motor co 
chrysler corp trw inc and motorola inc among union backers are 
the aflcio the united auto workers and the united steelworkers 
prestowitz who has argued in the past about heavy japanese 
spending on washington lobbying said the institute had not received 
any financial backing from japan 
but we wouldnt turn it down if it showed up on our 
doorstep he said

gave her a lethal dose of chemicals 
the last thing janet adkins told dr jack kevorkian on monday 
was you just make my case known then he said she pressed a 
button on the contraption and released the lethal mixture 
some medical ethicists called the doctors actions immoral and 
perhaps illegal a prosecutor said he would wait for autopsy results 
before deciding whether to charge kevorkian and will seek an 
injunction to prevent the doctor from using the device again 
kevorkian told the associated press in a telephone interview late 
tuesday that it was the first time he had used the device to assist 
a suicide 
the portland ore womans husband defended his wifes right to 
die 
she loved life she just lived life to the fullest ron 
adkins said tuesday night in a news conference in portland she 
was a powerful woman and she was an intelligent woman 
i was the weak one she was strong she had made up her mind 
one of the couples three sons neil said she was in a very 
good state of mind thats the amazing thing 
it was not a desperate thing or a depressed situation she was 
the one that helped us all through it neil adkins told kgwtv in 
portland 
kevorkian said mrs adkins traveled to michigan during the 
weekend to use his suicide device he drove the 54yearold woman in 
his van to a park in northern oakland county on monday afternoon 
according to kevorkian he and one of his relatives attached mrs 
adkins to a heart monitor then put an intravenous tube in her arm 
the tube first delivered a saline solution kevorkian said mrs 
adkins then pressed a button that injected thiopental a 
comainducing drug followed moments later by potassium chloride 
which stops the heart within minutes 
he said she was unconscious in 25 seconds and died in five or 
six minutes 
it simulates exactly the judicial executions that we do now 
with legal executions except with this device the person does it 
himself by pushing a button kevorkian told the detroit news on 
monday 
the last thing janet adkins said was you just make my case 
known said kevorkian 
the doctor is a retired pathologist and an outspoken advocate of 
what he calls doctorassisted suicide 
physicians should not be killers even in cases where the 
patient requests it and there is a compassionate reason behind the 
act said susan wolf of the hastings center for biomedical 
research in briarcliff ny they take an oath to do no harm and 
taking a life is doing harm 
kevorkian said in march that he expected to be prosecuted after 
the first use of the druginjecting device he also said he would 
not charge patients and that he might use it to take his own life 
some day 
adkins and her husband spent several hours by themselves before 
she and the doctor drove to the park kevorkian said late tuesday 
i wasnt there but from what i understand it was very emotional 
and very prolonged obviously this was the last time they would see 
each other he said 
after mrs adkins died kevorkian notified police oakland county 
prosecutor richard thompson said he wont decide if he will bring 
charges against the doctor until he gets an autopsy report and state 
police finish their investigation the police have the device 
thompson added 
kevorkian said adkins came to michigan with her husband and a 
friend both of whom stayed at a motel while she died and caught a 
flight back to oregon later monday night in oregon providing the 
means to commit suicide is a felony but michigan has no law against 
suicide assisted by a physician 
kevorkian said the adkinses contacted him in october after 
learning about his device and he recommended treatment with an 
experimental drug at a seattle hospital but it didnt work ron 
adkins said 
his wife of 34 years left a suicide letter which read in part 
i have alzheimers disease and do not want to let it progress any 
farther i dont choose to put my family or myself through the agony 
of this terrible disease 
the device itself an aluminum frame with three suspended 
bottles and a small electric motor is not illegal said gerald 
poisson assistant oakland county prosecutor 
but in certain cases the person who made it available to the 
suicide victim could be charged with homicide he said tuesday 
jim baughman of the wayne county prosecutors office in detroit 
said last year that helping someone die would not be a crime if the 
patient injected the drugs 
but two lawyers specializing in medical ethics after hearing 
details of the kevorkian case said his actions were improper 
what this physician did was way over the line said wolf 
it was unethical and may well have been illegal 
according to the american medical association passive euthanasia 
is ethical said reinhard priester of the center for biomedical 
ethics at the university of minnesota 
passive euthanasia might for example involve withholding food 
from a comatose patient believed to have no chance of recovery he 
said 
but priester said kevorkian by arranging a suicide ostensibly 
with the patients consent appeared to have participated in active 
euthanasia which the ama has deemed morally inappropriate 
the clear intent of providing those two chemicals was to hasten 
the patients death priester said 
the new york citybased society for the right to die supports 
peoples right to refuse medical treatment but in general doesnt 
support assisted suicide said director rose gasner 
hes pushing the boundaries she said its uncharted legal 
territory

a lab test to diagnose alzheimers disease in the 
living could be developed within two years using a new technique 
that has been highly accurate on brain tissue from cadavers 
scientists say 
currently there is no precise way of diagnosing the 
memoryrobbing disease in the living doctors make a diagnosis based 
on the patients symptoms after death an autopsy can help confirm 
the diagnosis but the technique now in use is inexact 
the new test measures a protein that is believed to be associated 
with alzheimers and has not been detected in the brains of normal 
people and those with other neurological disorders said 
neurobiochemist hossein a ghanbari lead author of the study in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
the importance of this finding is that the protein can be used 
later on as a model to come up with a diagnostic test in spinal 
fluid said ghanbari senior research scientist at abbott 
laboratories in suburban north chicago 
the test for living patients could come within two years but 
would need to be 1000 times more sensitive ghanbari said in a 
telephone interview tuesday 
the protein which researchers call the alzheimers 
diseaserelated protein was found in 48 of 56 alzheimers patients 
the scientists reported 
no detectable levels of the protein were found in autopsied brain 
tissue from 27 patients free of neurological disease and 28 patients 
with neurological diseases other than alzheimers the researchers 
said 
since they submitted their report they have tested about 240 
more brain samples and still have about a 90 percent agreement 
with the diagnosis ghanbari said 
an estimated 4 million us adults mostly over age 65 have 
alzheimers a degenerative brain and nerve disorder death usually 
comes in five to 10 years after complications from bed sores 
feeding problems and pneumonia 
diagnosis depends mostly on looking for symptoms which begin 
with memory loss and difficulty speaking and progress to personality 
changes and loss of ability to function doctors adopt the process 
of elimination ruling out one by one other causes of the dementia 
such as syphillis or poisoning 
even after autopsy current methods are inexact for diagnosing 
alzheimers 
confirming the diagnosis in patients who have died requires 
dissecting the brain examining stained samples under a microscope 
and counting the characteristic nerve tangles and hardened deposits 
or plaques of alzheimers 
the neuropathologist has to decide which ones to count and 
which ones not to count said creighton phelps vice president for 
medical and scientific affairs with the chicagobased alzheimers 
association its subjective 
this new test would remove the subjective component either 
its there or its not phelps said as such it would be the 
only quantitative test that we have 
the test will need confirmation by other scientists said phelps 
a former program director at the national institute on agings 
neuroscience and neuropsychology of aging program 
using the test now on brain samples from living patients makes 
little sense since no cure and no effective treatment for 
alzheimers exists and brain biopsy involves some risk ghanbari 
said 
the protein identified in the study includes a subprotein called 
a68 described in 1986 as a possible marker for alzheimers by 
researcher peter davies of albert einstein college of medicine of 
yeshiva university in new york ghanbari said davies was a 
coauthor of the new study funded partly by abbott and supported by 
the national institute of mental health 
the protein differs from a defective blood protein called 
transferrin described last month in the british journal lancet by 
scientists who thought it might help lead to a diagnostic test for 
the disease ghanbari said

for more than four decades west berliners 
have been stockpiling huge quantities of provisions to keep the city 
alive in case of another soviet blockade 
city officials now say that changing times have made the 
warehouses filled with sugar grain bandages toothpaste and 
hundreds of other items unnecessary 
this is a relic of the cold war said gerhard erbe the city 
official in charge of supervising a large portion of the emergency 
reserves 
the germans began stockpiling on the orders of the victorious 
western allies the united states france and britain after the 
berlin airlift broke the traumatic soviet blockade in may 1949 
west berlins leftist leaders say the federal government in bonn 
should ask the allies for permission to scrap the whole program for 
the city of 2 million people 
city government economics chief peter mitzscherling has even 
suggested giving the food and other supplies to eastern european 
nations where democracy has replaced cold war stalinism 
west berlin officials decline to give a breakdown of how much is 
stored saying its still kept top secret to keep the potential 
enemy from learning details of the plans 
the goal is in the event of another blockade to provide the 
city with all necessary goods erbe said it was also to have a 
calming effect on the people 
erbe said the goods stored in 200 separate locations are to 
last as rations for a long period of time but he declined to 
specify how long 
one of the storehouses is located in teeming westhafen along the 
spandau shipping canal where sacks of sugar medicines and 
thousands of cases of jarred of fruit are carefully stored 
horst kleffel who supervises part of the program for the federal 
government said the plan was to have enough food on hand for six 
months but he concedes that some things we now have in smaller 
quantities 
the berliner morgenpost newspaper has reported that 166444 tons 
of grain 38752 tons of canned vegetables and 493668 tons of light 
heating oil are stored the goods are routinely sold off and 
restocked to ensure that everything is usable 
over the years the stockpiled goods have provided great comfort 
to berliners especially the elderly who remember how their city 
was torn apart by the collapse of nazi germany in 1945 and shut off 
from the world by the soviet blockade three years later 
the soviets tried to starve the western part of the city into 
submission blocking passengers and traffic starting in june 1948 
for 10 months a massive western airlift organized by the united 
states kept the city alive 
even though the four power agreement of 1971 set aside many of 
the disputes with the soviets the emergency reserves stayed in this 
city 100 miles within thencommunist east germany 
the federal government in bonn provides about 125 million a year 
to maintain the reserves which could be worth up to 16 billion 
as officials look around to save money during the enormously 
expensive unification process the reserves have become a likely 
target for savings they have also been the subject of sarcasm 
the west berlin city government even wanted to start getting 
rid of the huge supplies of toilet paper since according to state 
secretary juergen dittberner people could just use a newspaper in 
an emergency the frankfurter rundschau quoted the citys no 2 
economics official as saying 
but at the prompting of the federal government the toilet 
paper stayed the newspaper said 
chancellor helmut kohls government must study the request to 
halt the program before deciding whether to pass it on to the 
western allies 
anthony w sariti us diplomatic spokesman in berlin said it 
is not certain what answer the allies will give but given the 
tenor of the times i cant imagine we would give it unsympathetic 
hearing 
selling off the stockpiles could take three or more years 
the list of stockpiled items includes soap cleaning materials 
coffee fish meat as well as clothing for children erbe said one 
thing is missing dog food to feed berliners adored pooches 
people would have to share their own rations with their dogs 
he said with a laugh

police charged a black critic of school 
desegregation with distributing wanted posters offering 10000 
for the slayings of seven blacks negotiating an integration plan 
ralph leon stephens 47 was arrested tuesday and jailed on 
charges of soliciting murder he also was charged with extortion 
this is a very serious matter state attorney ed austin said 
but it is just a crime it is not a racially motivated crime 
it appears to be a struggle in the black community sheriff 
jim mcmillan said 
the posters declared the seven black leaders were wanted dead 
or alive for selfserving crimes murdering our kids future shoot 
on sight 10000 price guarantee 
the seven are key players in negotiations with school officials 
to devise a desegregation plan that complies with a federal court 
order stephens is a member of a committee opposed to local 
desegregation plans the sheriff said 
school security officials the sheriffs office and the fbi began 
investigating the posters after they appeared on may 26 
police began hourly patrols around the homes of those named on 
the posters school board members wendell holmes and samuel nesbitt 
national association for the advancement of colored people education 
chairman fred matthews jacksonville urban league president ronnie 
ferguson the rev rudolph missick assistant superintendent alvin 
white and willye dennis president of the local chapter of the naacp 
in december a package bomb similiar to those that killed a 
federal appeals court judge and a savannah ga lawyer was 
intercepted at mrs dennis office before it exploded 
there is no connection at all to the earlier bombing threat to 
mrs dennis and the naacp mcmillan said

children face far greater risks from global 
pollution than do adults a united nations report says 
children are too often the victims of pollution their young 
bodies make them far more vulnerable than adults to the poisons we 
spew into the air and toxins we sow on earth said the unicef 
report 
the report by the un childrens fund titled children and the 
environment was compiled in association with the un environment 
program and was released on tuesday world environment day 
it listed many of the ills facing children in developing and 
developed countries alike 
forty thousand children under the age of five die daily it said 
about 100 million children live on the streets where they are 
forced to scavenge steal and often fall prey to drugs prostitution 
and gangs it said 
an increasing number of children are aids orphans whose parents 
have died from the dread disease it said 
the number of children living in poverty in the united states has 
risen by more than 3 million over the last 10 years the report said 
despite the discouraging news of poverty sickness and death the 
report said improved international cooperation on the environment 
offers hope as does the thawing of the cold war 
the ending of the cold war provides a unique opportunity for 
the great powers to confront the real threats to planetary 
survival the report said 
sir richard attenborough speaking at a london news conference 
where the report was introduced called on governments and banks in 
developed countries to work together on the third worlds 
appalling debt 
we give less to the third world than we receive ten years ago 
40 billion went from the developed world to developing countries 
now that figure is 60 billion but its going in the opposite 
direction it is a shaming thought said attenborough who 
received an academy award for directing the 1982 film gandhi 
the report emphasized our generations responsibility to 
protect the earth we bequeath our children and suggested that 
priority be given to improving infant mortality rates and education 
in developing countries 
efforts to lower births however well planned cannot fully 
succeed unless they are accompanied by basic programs to protect 
child health and ensure child survival the report said

under pressure from builders and congress 
federal regulators are moving to ease lending restrictions imposed 
on savings and loans under last years bailout law 
the office of thrift supervision is proposing to temporarily 
quadruple to 60 percent the percentage of capital that a qualified 
thrift institution may lend to one borrower an agency official said 
tuesday 
the office was under intense pressure from lawmakers who were 
inundated with complaints from builders that the rule was forcing 
them to curtail projects putting their employees out of work 
last years sampl legislation had sharply reduced the lending 
limit aiming to sever the cozy relationship between highflying sampls 
and some developers in the past loan limits were so high that the 
default of a single loan could bankrupt a thrift 
however builders complained that the shift was too abrupt and 
left many reputable builders unable to arrange alternative financing 
for sound projects 
last month the national association of homebuilders cited the 
regulation as one element in a credit crunch they predicted would 
cut housing construction nationally by 100000 units to 128 million 
this year 
under a draft regulation submitted by the thrift agency to the 
treasury department and the office of management and budget the 
strongest sampls would be allowed to lend up to 60 percent of their 
capital to a single us developer for residential construction 
that is four times the 15 percent limit imposed by sampl bailout 
legislation enacted last august the limit would drop to 30 percent 
before returning to the 15 percent mark at the end of 1991 said the 
thrift office official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
before passage of the sampl bailout law thrifts had been allowed 
to lend 100 percent of their capital to one borrower 
the new transition rule would not apply to commercial projects 
and only sampls currently meeting strict capital standards effective 
in 1995 would be eligible the thrift office official said 1185 of 
the nations 2502 solvent sampls meet the test 
this will give us some breathing room said economist david 
seiders of the homebuilders group we think it will provide a lot 
of help 
the association had been pushing for a somewhat longer transition 
period and had wanted regulators to make a larger group of thrifts 
eligible for the relaxation but seiders said this is a step in 
the right direction 
the homebuilders had mounted a campaign in congress where 
legislators in both chambers were preparing amendments to the sampl 
law a transition rule proposed by rep peter hoagland dneb had 
attracted more than 60 cosponsors 
however seiders said the builders all along had been looking for 
relief from regulators rather than having to wait months for 
congress to change the law 
details of the loantooneborrower proposal were first reported 
in tuesday editions of american banker a trade newspaper the 
thrift office hopes to formally announce the policy by the end of 
the month the agency official said 
regulators in testimony to a house banking subcommittee in 
february indicated that last years law left them with no 
discretion to issue a transition rule however treasury 
undersecretary robert glauber told the senate banking committee in 
may that thrift office lawyers were working to establish their 
authority to interpret the law 
seiders praised timothy ryan the new director of the thrift 
office for his willingness to review the matter after taking office 
two months ago 
we think its a good sign in terms of prospects for working 
with ryan and the agency the homebuilders official said

the senate race was the only major contest on the montana ballot 
republicans are hoping for a replay this fall of the 1988 general 
election when conrad burns a relatively unknown county 
commissioner from billings toppled veteran democratic sen john 
melcher 
national republicans including president bush and former 
president ronald reagan searched for a wellknown republican to 
challenge baucus they recruited kolstad 58 who became lieutenant 
governor only 17 months ago 
kolstad emphasized his farming background his 20 years in the 
state legislature and his lifelong ties to montana the emphasis 
also was a slap at vorhauer who moved his legal residence to 
montana only last fall 
vorhauer 48 is best known as the inventor of the today 
contraceptive sponge his campaign stressed his engineering and 
science background as qualifying him to bring hightech businesses 
to the state 
farrell 41 a trucking company owner touted his workingman 
image domenech 36 campaigned for a national health plan 
baucus ran a quiet primary campaign with neither of his 
challengers having much money or elaborate organizations baucus has 
raised about 2 million citing the republican challenge he will 
face this fall

jerome robbins broadway is on broadway 
jerome robbins ballet is at the new york state theater in lincoln 
center 
there the new york city ballet began a festival of jerome 
robbins ballets on tuesday night it will last through june 17 
seven programs are danced twice and one only once 
two impressions burst out at tuesdays opening wow what a 
choreographer golly what a company 
the evening began with robbins famous fancy free his first 
ballet with music by leonard bernstein and scenery by oliver smith 
three sailors feeling the emotion of the title are on shore leave 
in new york on a hot summer night in 1944 the year robbins 
choreographed it 
the sailors who danced chased girls and then teased and flirted 
with them were damian woetzel tom gold and robert lafosse they 
werent as exuberant as some weve seen dance this ballet but their 
dancing was so crisp and their characterizations so good they looked 
like theyd been drilled by robbins

prime minister margaret thatcher says the french 
and west german bans on british beef are quite illegal and 
insists there was no health danger 
british beef is safe the prime minister said in the house of 
commons tuesday those who have banned it have done so more as a 
measure of protection for their own farmers 
france and west germany both banned the import of british beef 
after the discovery that some cattle were infected with bovie 
spongiform encephlopathy or mad cow disease 
the disease identified in britain in 1986 is blamed for killing 
13648 cows here 
 
the british government warned tuesday that it would be forced to 
retaliate in kind against the bans if they are not lifted at todays 
emergency meeting of the european community agriculture ministers in 
brussels 
conservative party lawmaker john watts said it would be improper 
for britain to respond in kind but he urged british consumers to 
use their purchasing power to boycott french goods including 
appalling french golden delicious apples 
another tory alan amos was cheered when he said he had eaten 
british beef for lunch and medical evidence showed it was 
perfectly safe 
french beef producers told their government tuesday that they 
wanted the ban on imports extended to beef from ireland which has 
had 19 cases of bovie spongiform encephlopathy 
the cause of mad cow disease is unknown because the symptoms 
are similar to scrapie a sheep disease it is assumed the disease 
was transmitted through cattle feeds

the administrations plan to create a new 
national drug intelligence center to coordinate information on drug 
traffickers is being criticized on capitol hill as an improper use 
of scarce money 
justice department officials briefed congressional appropriations 
panels and other executive agencies tuesday on a detailed plan for 
ndic which was proposed in president bushs national drug control 
strategy earlier this year 
several lawmakers questioned the proposal to spend money for the 
center when some law enforcement agencies dont have enough money to 
hire needed agents one congressional aide said later 
there is a general concern that this was not one of the no 1 
priorities that the top priority should be staffing up the law 
enforcement agencies on the street said the staffer who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
theres still a lot of questions things that are unanswered 
such as how are we going to pay for it another aide said 
the plan outlined in a justice department study calls for no 
money to be spent this fiscal year ending sept 30 however ndic 
would cost about 81 million next year and 459 million in fiscal 
1992 when it would be fully operational with 150 employees 
the first two years include many nonrecurring costs for such 
things as computer equipment so the estimated annual cost after 
that would drop to 267 million the report said 
the study said the money should come from the special forfeiture 
fund in the office of national drug control policy headed by 
william j bennett that money is seized from drug traffickers 
the ndic came in for criticism even before the justice department 
presented its report 
last month three members of the house armed services 
investigations subcommittee said that instead of creating a new 
center the el paso intelligence center in texas should be improved 
that facility run by the drug enforcement administration 
coordinates tactical information to be used immediately such as the 
location of a possibly drugladen aircraft it does not provide 
longrange strategic information 
there is a propensity to proliferate intelligence fusion 
centers as if the administration believed the more intelligence 
centers we created the better intelligence product we would gain 
reps nicholas mavroules dmass lane evans dill and jim 
mccrery rla said in a report but quantity is not quality 
privately some justice department officials agreed but said 
bennetts office had pushed hard for the new intelligence center and 
the proposal reflects a good compromise 
justice department spokeswoman harri j kramer said the need for 
ndic became apparent in the course of involving other 
nontraditional agencies in the drug war such as the defense 
department 
an enhanced mechanism for coordinating interaction between the 
intelligence community and the law enforcement community were also 
needed kramer said the ndic will play an important role in 
addressing these two gaps as well as to refine the process of 
establishing intelligence collection priorities 
bennetts office applauded the justice department proposal it 
is exactly what the president calls for in his drug control 
strategy spokeswoman amy brown said 
ndic will involve the dea fbi immigration and naturalization 
service customs service coast guard cia national security agency 
and the state defense and treasury departments

the soviets are making good on nikita 
khrushchevs prediction that theyll bury the west but theyre 
doing it with fax paper 
if politically countries are changing why should information 
agencies work in the same manner the old manner said alexander 
malyshkin senior information officer for the soviet embassy 
the soviets it seems have discovered what everyone from 
prodemocracy dissidents in china to american restaurants learned 
before that the fax machine is a quick and stealthy way to get 
your information where it hasnt gone before 
its glasnost for the information age and the soviets used it 
with a vengeance during last weeks superpower summit 
i have been just inundated our fax machine has been going 
almost constantly frank partsch editorial page editor of the 
omaha worldherald said tuesday 
partsch said he was holding 30 to 40 pages of soviet material 
about half what spewed out of his facsimile machine during the 
summit 
its the first time ive ever seen this said bob haring 
executive editor of the tulsa world who received 20 to 30 pages of 
faxed material from the soviet embassy in washington 
the soviets say its nothing unusual just another embassy using 
technology a japanesemade fax machine that is to reach the 
media 
its very effective said embassy spokesman boris malakhov 
who said the embassy press office fax was in use constantly to 
issue press advisories on president mikhail gorbachevs visit 
but getting a fax from behind the iron curtain strikes some 
recipients as unusual and the soviets say theyre restructuring 
their use of technology to get the word out about changes inside 
their country 
were using modern knowhow to reach newspapers malyshkin 
said american media is very fast you know 
he said his office has one fax machine and aides work all the 
time to relay articles by the official novosti press agency opinion 
pieces by soviet officials and even lighthearted features on life in 
the soviet republics 
malyshkin said he didnt know how many faxes his office sent out 
last week 
but if calls to a handful of newspapers are any indication there 
may be more openness than the american media can handle 
i havent had a chance to do anything with them said 
virginia hall opinion pages editor of the kansas city star where 
about 10 soviet faxes on various topics arrived 
i havent had a chance to read it partsch said from omaha 
theres a lot of it and i dont like faxes

thomas root the lawyer whose mysterious 
atlantic ocean plane crash last year came amid a probe of his law 
practice faces up to 35 years in prison and 125 million in fines 
on his guilty plea to felony charges of misrepresenting clients 
root an alexandria va communications attorney pleaded guilty 
to five felony counts in federal court tuesday the charges involved 
clients who were seeking broadcast licenses from the federal 
communications commission 
he was indicted monday by a grand jury in north carolina on 455 
counts of securities fraud and other charges 
a federal grand jury in washington had returned a 33count 
indictment against root in march root 37 declined comment after 
entering his plea 
roots attorney eugene propper said root feels hes getting a 
lot more attention than he otherwise would because of the july 13 
1989 flight 
roots cessna 210 airplane crashed in the atlantic off the 
bahamas after a mysterious sixhour flight in which he said he 
blacked out and the plane continued on autopilot until it hit the 
water 
but navy fighter pilots who intercepted the flight said they saw 
root moving in the cockpit 
rescuers discovered root had a gunshot wound to his stomach 
which still has not been explained root says he does not know how 
he got shot 
root has denied that financial and legal troubles were connected 
with the flight 
indicted with root by the nash country nc grand jury were 
sonrise management services telemedia inc and three other men 
identified as coowners of the two businesses 
root handled radio license applications for investors of sonrise 
management 
the indictments allege the companies violated securities laws by 
not registering securities failing to register sales agents 
engaging in false and deceptive sales practices and conspiring to 
violate securities laws 
in the federal case root on tuesday admitted giving the fcc a 
counterfeit document stating that the federal aviation 
administration had approved a proposed missouri site for a radio 
tower 
he also said he gave a north carolina client a forged fcc 
document indicating its license application had been reinstated and 
defrauded another north carolina client by settling a claim against 
a competitor for onefifth the authorized amount 
root pleaded guilty to giving a false document to a new york 
client seeking a site on long island for a radio station and 
falsely telling another client he would get an fcc application 
reinstated when he had sought the dismissal 
the former missouri client monte hanson president of northern 
missouri christian broadcasting co of kirksville said his company 
had retained a new attorney and is still seeking an fcc license for 
its proposed station 
were still working with the fcc and faa to iron out the 
problems that root caused hanson said 
the columbus gabased sonrise management which touted 
christian principles in sales literature and issued business cards 
inscribed with crosses went out of business several months ago 
north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said only a 
handful of sonrise management investors ever received fcc licenses 
in all 1018 people in north carolina contributed more than 8 
million to this organization edmisten said nationally more 
than 16 million was invested by people from 25 states 
edmisten said there was little chance investors would recoup 
their money

us marines are waiting off the coast of 
liberia in case they are needed to evacuate american citizens from 
that nations strife but not to support either side in the civil 
war us officials say 
the us military has no role to play in this conflict state 
department spokesman richard boucher told reporters tuesday 
despite pleas from embattled president samuel doe that the united 
states come to the aid of the liberian people officials in 
washington reject the idea of us military involvement 
our primary concern is protecting us citizens white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
in addition though the united states agreed to evacuate soviet 
diplomats from liberia if necessary defense secretary dick cheney 
said in an interview tuesday with hearst newspapers 
it hasnt been required yet but the fact of the matter is they 
the soviets have asked for and we have agreed to provide 
assistance to their people in liberia cheney said in the 
interview 
between 10 and 15 soviet diplomats remained in liberia the 
hearst report said 
boucher in a statement read to reporters said the united states 
is taking appropriate steps to assist american citizens to leave 
liberia in the event that they are in more immediate danger and no 
longer able to leave the country by other means 
the navys fourship flotilla in international waters off the 
liberian coast solely on a contingency basis to evacuate american 
citizens if it becomes necessary boucher said 
fitzwater reported that 70 us officials and about 1200 
american private citizens were left in the country 
president bush dispatched the warships from the 
mediterraneanbased 6th fleet over the weekend in case the struggle 
between forces loyal to doe and those supporting rebel leader 
charles taylor bar any americans from leaving 
the uss saipan an amphibious assault ship the uss ponce an 
amphibious transport dock ship the uss sumter a tank landing ship 
and the uss peterson an escort destroyer are off the liberian

usually carry nine ch53 sea stallion helicopters and 12 ch46 
sea knight helicopters 
such assault ships also carry av8b harrier jets which serve as 
light attack and close air support aircraft 
all of the ships are homeported in norfolk va and carry about 
170 officers and about 2100 enlisted marines the navy said 
boucher said the rebels continued to advance towards the capital 
of monrovia and that flights had been suspended from roberts 
international airport where there were reports of fighting 
the spokesman said commercial aircraft were continuing to use 
spriggs payne airfield about five miles from the center of the 
capital city and that the road to sierra leone remains usable 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams stressed the 
precautionary nature of the deployment of the marine group he said 
he couldnt define any trigger that might bring them ashore to 
assist in an evacuation including the event that all air travel 
would be stopped 
he said he had no indication that there were americans who wanted 
to leave but couldnt 
williams declined to outline any plan for a possible evacuation 
citing security concerns 
but he said the marines could be used for such things as 
providing security at the airport or assisting americans in 
leaving from some other point out to the ships or to another 
country

more than 40 years after exposing thousands of 
americans to dangerous radiation from nuclear testing programs the 
government is close to offering an apology and compensation to those 
who have cancer 
a bill approved by the house on voice vote tuesday would set up a 
100 million fund to pay victims of radiation disease brought on by 
the atmospheric nuclear testing program conducted in nevada from 
1945 to 1963 and the mining of uranium for the tests 
the measure also carries a formal apology to the american 
people that were subjected and sacrificed for the cold war nuclear 
weapons said rep wayne owens dutah sponsor of the bill 
the radiation exposure compensation act is awaiting floor action 
in the senate 
proponents of the bill described radioactive fallout that fell 
like snow from the skies near the nuclear test site in nevada 
i remember as a child growing up in southern utah watching the 
sky light up with various colors from the nuclear explosions at the 
nevada test site just 100 crowflying miles away owens said 
he likened it to a fourth of july fireworks display and said 
the only difference was that instead of celebrating our 
independence years later we were mourning the death of our friends 
from the epidemic of leukemias and other cancers in southern utah 
he said 
owens said the government claimed at the time that no ones 
health was endangered by the tests 
the bill would affect people who lived in nevada colorado new 
mexico arizona utah and wyoming 
the legislation stems in part from work by stewart udall former 
congressman and interior secretary who represented the uranium 
miners in a lawsuit against the government in 1979 
he started a drive for congressional action after the courts 
ruled that the government was immune from prosecution because 
national security needs dictated an uninterrupted flow of great 
quantities of uranium ore 
owens was part of a team of lawyers who sued the government on 
behalf of the socalled downwinders judges in that case ruled 
similarly to the one involving the miners 
udall said that despite the rulings some of the judges who 
handled the case wrote opinions that counseled the plaintiffs to 
seek redress from congress 
today the house of representatives restores our nations honor 
by holding the government responsible for cold war abuses that have 
stained our collective consciences by causing death and injury to 
its own people owens said the cold war cant be over until we 
have paid the debt to the civilian victims 
during the atmospheric atomic weapons testing an estimated 
220000 military personnel and 150000 civilians were exposed to 
radiation those in the military who became ill have received 
disability benefits 
udall said about 950 to 1300 miners or their families would 
receive compensation 
under the bill the justice department would establish the 
amounts people would be paid based on medical documentation 
to be eligible individuals would have to have been in areas 
downwind from the nevada test site for at least a year between 1951 
and 1958 or between june and july 1962 miners who worked in 
uranium mines between 1947 and 1971 would be eligible if they were 
exposed to a specific amount of radiation

the senate agriculture committee is getting 
strong opposition from its ranking republican to any increases in 
target prices or loan rates in the 1990 farm bill 
sen richard lugar rind said tuesday he was standing firm on 
freezing target prices and loan rates and he said he was unwilling 
to take more acreage out of production or accept shifts in finances 
to create the illusion of deficit reduction 
ive been infinitely flexible in other things in the bill 
lugar said but he said these four areas were not negotiable and 
would lead to a floor fight if the democratic majority on the 
committee insists in keeping them in the bill 
the democrats have to decide do we want an issue or do we 
want a bill said lugar if an issue is what they want then my 
guess is we will have a oneyear extension in the 1985 farm bill 
expiring this year 
lugar commented at a breakfast meeting with reporters immediately 
before he went into a session with a bipartisan task force created 
by agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt to work out 
a compromise on commodities supports 
the task force also includes sens bob kerrey dneb david 
pryor dark bob dole rkan and thad cochran rmiss not all 
members were present and little was accomplished at tuesdays 
meeting sources close to the committee said 
the democrats want to increase target prices 1 percent with 
other increases possible in the last four years of the program 
depending on inflation 
congress passes a farm bill every five years to set agriculture 
policy including the degree to which government will subsidize 
farmers through target prices and loan rates 
current law expires in december but the bush administration has 
said repeatedly that it would accept a oneyear extension of 
existing policies 
that is viewed by many in congress as a strategy which would help 
us negotiators at the international trade talks known as the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the united states is trying 
to get other countries to remove subsidies from agricultural 
products that distort world market prices 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who is actively involved 
in those talks has said that us subsidies may have to be adjusted 
to comply with whatever agreement develops they are expected to be 
completed by the end of this year 
lugar mentioned the trade talks in his talk with reporters but 
he said his main objection to the democrats proposal for increasing 
target prices is budgetary 
at a time when it is fairly likely people may be asked to pay 
more taxes for the farm program to be asking for more money is not 
prudent he said 
the house agriculture committee meanwhile has voted to freeze 
target prices

the guesswork will be taken out of agricultural 
finance when guidelines developed through the american bankers 
association are in effect say members of task force that developed 
the program 
standardized methods for figuring farm expenses will help make 
farmers more competitive by giving them better information as to how 
their operations stack up financially with all others the task 
force said tuesday 
the producers have been looking for help said steve hofing 
a consultant from champaign ill who served on the panel 
he said farm business has been hindered because each creditor and 
farmer has his own set of forms and method of recordkeeping 
we need guidelines so net farm income means the same thing in 
maryland as in washington state said hofing 
this will be achieved by standardization of farm financial ratio 
calculations definitions and reporting formats 
jim mcgrann of texas aampm university a member of the task force 
said farmer are increasingly using computers and that software 
companies are big supporters of the standardization 
mcgrann said that use of standard financial reporting will give 
the government a more exact idea of the economic condition of 
agriculture when it comes time to develop the fiveyear farm bill 
stanley forbes chairman of the task force said the guidelines 
could be fully adopted by farmers and financial institutions within 
five years

washington federal safety investigators say thousands of 
bridges need to be inspected by underwater divers to see if they 
face the same danger that caused a tennessee bridge to collapse last 
year killing eight motorists 
the national transportation safety board on tuesday blamed 
erosion from a shifting river channel for the april 1 1989 
collapse of a us 51 bridge over the hatchie river 45 miles north 
of memphis 
it certainly raises a serious concern with me about how much 
damage may have been done with flooding in texas and the south 
said ntsb chairman james kolstad im concerned that some of these 
bridges may be put back into service without adequate inspection 
the board called for a modification of federal bridge inspections 
standards to require underwater inspection of bridge parts exposed 
to excessive water depth or turbidity 
it also asked the tennessee department of transportation to 
follow up bridge inspections with further work by divers when there 
are doubts about submerged elements 
the board cited the 54yearold hatchie bridges simple design as 
a contributing factor in the accident that caused vehicles to plunge 
into the river from the highways two northbound lanes 
a newer southbound span remained intact but board investigators 
said its construction in 1974 accelerated movement of the river 
channel which had changed 83 feet from the time the northbound 
bridge was constructed in 1936 
the board cited the tennessee department of transportation for 
failing to evaluate and correct problems found in inspections dating 
back to 1979 
ntsb investigators said they did not know how many of the 
nations 500000 bridges might require underwater inspection and 
other steps to ensure their safety 
but investigator claude harris said the number needing additional 
scrutiny would number in the thousands 
a survey last year by the national association of counties 
estimated that 165000 bridges need repair or replacement with some 
states having up to 90 percent defective bridges 
the board voted 31 on the probable cause in the tennessee 
collapse and 40 on a set of recommendations to federal and state 
officials board member jim burnett said he would not support the 
conclusion until missing bridge parts are recovered and further 
inspections are made 
the ntsbs investigation remains open said kolstad and could be 
revised if evidence surfaces that points to further deficiencies in 
the bridge investigators told the board that bridge parts might be 
raised from the water in about two weeks 
the board said the bridge failed most likely from the 
deterioration of timber piles that were originally buried and not 
designed to be in water 
board members also cautioned tennessee authorities against 
allowing so many exemptions to vehicle weight restrictions on 
bridges about 70 a month for the hatchie bridge before it 
collapsed and called for closer scrutiny of overweight trucks and 
their impact on bridge safety

the pentagon has not spent 50 billion in money 
appropriated to it and congressional investigators fear it could be 
used at will by the department for major programs such as the b2 
bomber and attack submarine 
the existence of these accounts hampers the congress ability 
to control obligations staff investigators for a house 
subcommittee said in a draft version of testimony to be delivered 
today 
the agency for international development also has more than 11 
billion in unspent money and the energy department has about 325 
million the investigators said 
but the pentagon has the largest reserve of unspent cash in two 
accounts one known as the m account the other called a merged 
surplus authority account 
money appropriated by congress must be obligated or spent during 
a specific time period if not the funds lapse and the money is 
returned to the general fund of the us treasury 
the m account includes unspent money that is maintained by an 
agency or department and is used to pay previous obligations the 
merged surplus authority account is a treasury department account 
maintained by the appropriate agency and used for similar purposes 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations earlier this 
year accused the pentagon of maintaining semisecret slush funds 
the pentagon in a statement released tuesday said the accounts 
are neither a secret nor a slush fund 
any significant use of such balances requires congressional 
approval each adjustment after first 25 million said the 
pentagon which noted that requirements for their use of the money 
is more stringent than for other federal agencies 
congress created the accounts in 1956 to avoid appropriating 
additional money every year to pay for prior obligations 
they were intended to relieve congress of having to get 
involved in numerous nickelanddime transactions that the us 
government was validly obligated to pay investigators for 
dingells subcommittee said of the accounts 
no one envisioned these accounts would grow into a 100 billion 
fund which could be drawn upon whenever the agency concluded 
these monies could be used to fund obligations within the scope of 
existing contracts 
investigators from the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations said they had evidence that the navys 
aviation supply office had selectively purged many of its 
records in the m account 
the result is that the defense contract service administration is 
paying bills totaling 123 million that the navy cannot determine is 
valid investigators said 
in addition the air force recently used 500 million from the 
two accounts to correct problems with the b1b bomber 
the investigators suggested that the pentagon could take a 
similar approach in correcting problems with the ddg51 
guidedmissile destroyer the b2 stealth bomber and the ssn21 
submarine 
what is troubling is that this expired authority could be 
converted into paying the bills to correct these deficiencies 
without the approval of congress the investigators said 
rep john dingell dmich in a march letter to the house budget 
committee called for legislation to the appropriations bill to end 
the accounts 
with the existence of these slush funds the congress could 
virtually kill a weapons program and find out years later that it 
was still being funded from these accounts the congressman said

after more than two years of praying for rain 
in homes churches and on the steps of the state capitol north 
dakotans can see puddles in their wheat fields 
now theyre giving thanks even though its too early to say the 
drought is over 
it was so bleak and dry for so long that when we got the rain 
last week everyone came in with sunshine on their faces said 
gertrude buscher executive vice president of the bank of beulah 
some folks are calling it the milliondollar rain 
sanford williams who farms 2200 acres near wing in central 
north dakota said 4 inches of rain in the past few days are giving 
his crops new life 
two years ago we didnt pull the combine out at all last 
year we used the oats for hay said alvin braun who farms with 
his father near bismarck 
braun got 95 inch of rain over the weekend not as much as he 
needs but enough to give him hope 
the drought is hard financially on everybody but i think the 
mental stress is worse just knowing it can rain is really a help 
he said 
most of the rain has fallen in the eastern part of the state 
fargo has reported 5 inches since march 25 nearly half an inch 
above normal the area got more than 2 inches during a soaking last 
weekend 
farther west minot has seen 4 inches of rain slightly below 
average and dickinson has had 29 inches a little more than an 
inch below normal 
i think most people in the state are cautiously optimistic 
lt gov lloyd omdahl said tuesday theres no doubt its done an 
awful lot for morale but they realize they need a lot more 
the prospect of a third year of drought prompted more than 100 
people to gather on the steps of the capitol last month to pray for 
rain a rain dance also was held 
we feel christians responded seriously and god has honored 
that said the rev dom vetter of bismarck organizer of the 
prayer service 
while the rain is the main topic of discussion in coffee shops 
and on street corners farm experts warn the drought is far from 
over 
the rain has moistened dry topsoil but it has done little to 
restore soil reserves a study this week found moisture under the 
top 4 inches of soil still short over 97 percent of the state 
were starting to catch up in precipitation but its spotty 
said mark ewens a national weather service forecaster in fargo 
last year north dakota crops looked good until july 1 when 
temperatures in the 90s and three weeks of no rain burned up the 
fields 
that could happen again warned james helm a north dakota state 
university agronomist so far temperatures have been cool with 
highs in the 70s 
the cool wet weather also has hurt one bumper crop an unwanted 
one by slowing the hatching of grasshoppers that invade during dry 
spells

federally funded colleges and universities 
would have to report graduation rates for student athletes and 
others under a housepassed bill described as a consumer rights 
bill 
the bill cleared the house on a voice vote tuesday and was 
returned to the senate which earlier approved a different version 
under the bill federally supported institutions would have to 
report to the education department their overall graduation rates 
studentathlete graduation rates revenues from intercollegiate 
athletics campus security policies campus crime statistics and 
information about results of campus disciplinary hearings 
the graduation rates would pertain only to fulltime 
degreeseeking students 
it provides students with information which will assist them in 
making decisions concerning college attendance and information 
they need to protect themselves against becoming crime victims 
rep bill goodling rpa said 
much of the debate focused on provisions dealing with 
intercollegiate athletics 
student athletes have a right to know whether a school will treat 
them as chattel properties or as genuine students in need of 
preparation for life beyond the playing field said rep paul henry 
rmich 
sports are the top public relations vehicle for many colleges 
and universities henry said thus fielding winning teams 
becomes to a very large extent the consuming purpose of athletic 
programs the better the team the better the exposure regardless 
of the cost 
reporting requirements recently set by the national collegiate 
athletic association are too limited focusing only on the 
bigmoney sports of football and basketball said rep ed towns 
dny 
other sports must be covered as well towns said if we can 
report the ontime arrivals of airlines surely we can let the 
general public know whether or not students are getting a useful 
degree at a university 
too many highschool athletes dreaming of professional careers 
enroll at major universities where they cant handle the academics 
said rep tom mcmillen dmd a former college and nba basketball 
star 
unfortunately most have a better chance of becoming a brain 
surgeon than a professional athlete he said the dream is in 
fact an impossible dream for most we have a responsibility to these 
young people to instill in them the concept that if they want to 
punt on the field they cant punt in the classroom 
its a consumer rights bill for students goodling who said 
his interest especially in the crimestatistics provision arose 
from the murder of jeanne clery whose parents live in his district 
at lehigh university in bethlehem pa in 1986 
the truth is students are raped assaulted and murdered on 
college campuses he said the bill wont solve those problems but 
can ensure students are as aware of crimes on campus as you and i 
are of crimes in our neighborhoods or in the cities where we work 
he said

the securities and exchange commission would be 
empowered to curb the practice of program trading during stock 
market emergencies under legislation approved by the house 
the securities markets reform act would allow the sec to limit 
program trading during periods of extraordinary market 
volatility the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices 
the measure introduced last year was adopted by the house on a 
voice vote tuesday 
a similar market reform bill awaiting action by the senate does 
not contain a program trading curb 
critics of program trading rapidfire transactions through 
computerized buy and sell programs blame it for worsening the 1987 
stock market crash and the 190point market slide last oct 13 
they are especially critical of one form of program trading 
index arbitrage in which speculators try to take advantage of 
small brief price differences between the stock and futures markets 
by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while selling 
them in the other 
critics say that strategy and the volatility that often seems to 
accompany it have driven small investors out of the stock market 
last march the treasury department wrote the house energy and 
commerce committee opposing a program trading ban saying the 
measures language was overly broad and potentially harmful to 
market reform 
but the measure was voted out of committee anyway on march 13 
we are not talking about banning computers or legitimate 
program trading strategies far from it said rep edward j 
markey dmass chairman of the finance subcommittee that oversees 
the sec and one of the bills coauthors 
we are giving the sec the tools to protect the securities 
markets from manipulative trading strategies and to prohibit 
trading tactics that threaten fair and orderly markets in times 
of market volatility he said 
in addition to the program trading curb the bipartisan bill 
expands the authority of the sec chairman to shut down the 
securities markets with the presidents permission in times of 
market emergency 
requires large securities traders to report their market 
positions to the sec 
gives the sec authority to assess the financial health of the 
parent holding companies of brokerdealers 
the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc the onetime junk 
bond giant of wall street was precipitated in february by the 
failure of its parent holding company 
sec chairman richard c breeden has complained that under current 
law the agency did not have adequate information about drexels 
holding company before the firms collapse and that information 
about large stock trades was inadequate for government 
decisionmakers during the oct 13 market slide 
the program trading amendment in the house bill would require the 
sec to determine through its oftenlengthy rulemaking process 
what types of activities cause or contribute to extraordinary 
volatility before it could halt them

rebel forces have seized the 
headquarters of the worlds largest rubber plantation liberias 
biggest employer and are now believed to control every major 
industrial concern in the country 
on tuesday the insurgents gathered outside the gates of 
liberias international airport 25 miles from the capital of 
monrovia after seizing the headquarters of the adjoining rubber 
plantation their presence effectively closed the airport 
president samuel doe met with religious leaders in an attempt at 
peaceful negotiations to end the insurgency which began in december 
in northeastern nimba county and became a serious challenge after 
reported reprisals against civilians by government troops 
amnesty international says soldiers killed hundreds of civilians 
from the gio and mano ethnic groups the civil war has pitted 
members of the krahn and mandingo groups from which doe draws 
support against the gio and mano peoples who have largely backed 
rebel leader charles taylor doe is a krahn 
the rebels took the headquarters of the 120000acre 
bridgestonefirestone inc plantation tuesday after attacking 
government troops with mortars and automatic weapons 
plantation residents said dozens of rebels crossed the farmington 
river the last natural barrier before monrovia and moved onto 
the plantation 
diplomatic sources said about 15 or 20 soldiers briefly returned 
fire then fled toward the capital it has become a familiar story 
in the war with some soldiers abandoning key posts before the rebel 
advance 
diplomats say about 50 percent of a soldier corps they describe 
as illtrained and poorly paid have deserted government forces now 
are believed to number about the same as the rebels 3000 to 4000 
monrovia residents have been fleeing in fear for nearly a week 
insurgents now control every major industrial concern in the west 
african country of 25 million people except possibly the bong iron 
ore mine which has been cut off for days from monrovia and believed 
behind rebel lines 
in akron ohio a spokesman for bridgestonefirestone inc said 
the company wants to keep the plantation operating and that the 
americans operating it did not plan to evacuate 
the spokesman trevor hoskins referred to the guerrillas as 
freedom fighters he said the rebels occupied the management 
offices in the company town of harbel after surrounding the 
plantations factory late monday stopping rubber production 
hoskins said the rebels have told plantation managing director 
don ensminger that the fight was not with him or the plantation 
employees and they do not intend any destruction the plantation 
employs 8500 liberians and produces about 100 million pounds of 
rubbers a year 
diplomatic sources in monrovia a city of about 400000 people 
said they had no reports of casualties in fighting tuesday late 
tuesday harbel residents said by telephone that there were reports 
the rebels killed two mandingo civilians the reports could not be 
independently confirmed 
rebels are accused of killing dozens of mandingo and krahns 
meanwhile off monrovia four us warships carrying 2000 
marines remained ready to evacuate americans and other foreigners 
including the 10 to 15 soviet diplomats in liberia officials said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 33 
americans were evacuated monday and thousands had left earlier he 
said 70 us officials and about 1200 private american citizens 
remained 
washington has accused taylor the rebel leader of getting 
support from libya but it also has said us marines will not move 
to support doe who seized power in a bloody coup 10 years ago 
most of the rebels entered liberia from neighboring ivory coast 
in late december they accuse does administration of corruption 
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses 
taylor had been a close aide of doe heading the government 
agency responsible for disbursing public funds he fled the country 
after the liberian leader accused him of stealing 1 million from 
state coffers 
taylor denies the charges but doe says he will not negotiate 
with a criminal 
descendants of freed us slaves founded liberia in 1822 and it 
became black africas first independent country in 1847

restarting production of nuclear weapons 
components at the rocky flats plant near denver should be delayed 
until at least october an advisory committee says 
the energy department had tentatively planned to resume 
production this month at the plant which is the only source of 
plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
the committee believes that the necessary changes and training 
will take significantly longer to complete than previously 
forecast said a letter to energy secretary james d watkins from 
the departments advisory committee on nuclear facilities safety 
so much remains to be done that restart on the schedule 
indicated to us appears impractical said the letter sent monday 
and signed by chairman john f ahearne a former member of the 
nuclear regulatory commission 
a department official made portions of the letter available 
tuesday on condition of anonymity 
in march the department approved a plan by the contract operator 
of the plant egampg inc to resume production sometime in june and 
even if that date slipped a summer resumption has been expected 
watkins has not given the final goahead and his decision is 
expected any day 
the plant has been closed for safety and management improvements 
since november and the fbi has been investigating the handling of 
nuclear waste there 
the navy has testified that if production at rocky flats is not 
resumed soon it will be unable to load the latest trident 2 
submarines with the most modern warhead the w88 atop the new d5

democrats leaders say they have evidence suggesting 
a white house aide pulled a political dirty trick and instigated a 
police union protest that disrupted the partys state convention 
the aide ron kaufman a special assistant to president bush and 
his deputy personnel director denied he had anything to do with the 
demonstration 
the protest disrupted the democratic convention saturday at the 
springfield civic center nearly forcing its cancellation 
james roosevelt chief counsel for the state democratic party 
said suspicions of collusion by kaufman have been bolstered by word 
that kaufman met a few weeks before the convention with the 
president of the springfield police union 
i think what you have is some irresponsible police officers 
working with a political operative who got carried away roosevelt 
said 
state democratic officials said they would sue kaufman adding 
his name to a superior court lawsuit already initiated against the 
union 
the democrats claim the protest violated the civil rights of 
party delegates obstructing their ability to gather for a political 
assembly 
the union picketed outside the civic center for several hours 
thousands of delegates refused to cross the picket line and remained 
outside in wilting heat some delegates said they were manhandled by 
police when they tried to enter 
democratic leaders insist the union broke an agreement not to 
picket the convention hall and they suspect kaufman was the 
instigator 
something inspired those police to break the agreement 
roosevelt said the democrats noted that the union endorsed george 
bush in the 1988 presidential election 
kaufman and state republican party executive director alexander 
tennant were in springfield during the convention tennant said the 
two were meeting with delegates who might support republicans in 
november 
kaufman also acknowledged he had a brief conversation friday 
night with robert jacobson president of the union but kaufman said 
in a telephone interview tuesday that he unequivocably had 
nothing to do with the protest 
tennant said there was no evidence of a conspiracy and he 
accused the democrats of trying to duck responsibility for their own 
fiasco 
on the evening before the demonstration kaufman said he was in 
front of the convention center and jacobson showed him a squad car 
that was in poor condition that was the extent of it he said 
kaufman also acknowledged that he met with jacobson a few weeks 
before the convention but we did not talk anything about labor 
movements in springfield 
jacobson said i can categorically deny that i ever spoke to 
kaufman about this convention picket 
the union president insisted no politics were involved in the 
police protest the city has been mired in a labor dispute with its 
police and the union was threatening for weeks to picket the 
convention center 
on friday night however officials announced an agreement under 
which police would conduct only an informational picket if mayor 
mary hurley would not speak at the conventionthe union claimed 
hurley broke the agreement by entering the convention hall friday 
night 
theyre making this out to be like it was chicago 68 said 
jacobson referring to the tumultuous democratic national convention 
22 years ago

dismiss a 38 million libel suit filed against two journalists by 
irancontra figure richard v secord 
lawyer dean ringel told judge george h revercombe on tuesday 
that secords suit against leslie and andrew cockburn and the 
atlantic monthly press should be dismissed because no actual malice 
has been proved 
but w michael kramer attorney for the former air force major 
general contended that the authors falsely linked secord in a 1988 
book to narcotics trafficking as part of the effort to finance the 
contra rebels 
kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions 
and search for further evidence in the case 
revercombe took both motions under advisement 
kramer contended that the clear intent of the book out of 
control the story of the reagan administrations secret war in 
nicaragua was to exploit the irancontra affair by putting the 
administration and its key players in the worst possible light 
ringel argued that secord seems to assume that since the book 
takes a political position opposite to that of the previous 
administration that is evidence of malice

the campaign for perus presidential runoff 
sunday is passionate and angry but polltakers say voters energies 
are devoted more toward defeating the candidate they dislike than 
electing someone they support 
many peruvians are uneasy with both mario vargas llosa perus 
celebrated novelist and his opponent alberto fujimori 
pollsters say each candidate inspires millions with emotions of 
disappointment and distrust 
at least half of fujimoris supporters are people who are 
scared of vargas llosa said alfredo torres of the polling firm 
apoyo of those who support vargas llosa at least a third are 
voting against fujimori 
polls show fujimori with a slim but firm lead over vargas llosa 
a novelistturnedpolitician who champions the free market most 
polls show fujimori the son of japanese immigrant parents with a 
5point lead nationally 
vargas llosa may have cut into that lead after his performance 
sunday night in a nationally broadcast debate with fujimori an 
apoyo poll of 1080 television viewers in lima and six other cities 
showed vargas llosa winning 48 to 37 percent 
the heated 2hour debate was marked by personal attacks 
fujimori accused vargas llosa of spreading insults and 
calumnies against him the novelist said his opponent offered only 
generalities and banalities in his campaign 
an agricultural engineer and former university rector with no 
political experience fujimori was the surprise of firstround 
elections april 8 he surged past seven opponents to nearly tie 
vargas llosa 
vargas llosa received 276 percent of the vote to fujimoris 246 
percent a runoff was required because no candidate received a 
majority 
vargas llosa has detailed plans for resolving perus worst 
economic crisis of the century and for battling a savage leftist 
insurgency 
like vargas llosa fujimori favors getting back on good terms 
with the international financial community by renewing payments on 
perus 19 billion foreign debt 
vargas llosa and fujimori both advocate economic development 
rather than police action to wean peasants away from perus 
billiondollar cocaine trade 
unlike the novelist fujimori has avoided discussing in detail 
his plans to reverse perus slide into economic chaos and civil war 
vargas llosa favors privatization of perus stateowned 
companies elimination of price controls and import barriers and an 
economic shock program to combat inflation 
fujimori opposes all three and thereby scores points with workers 
who fear for their jobs and with businesses that defend protective 
trade laws 
vargas llosa has questioned fujimoris competence vargas llosas 
allies say fujimori is a puppet of the discredited leftofcenter 
aprista party of president alan garcia 
even the roman catholic church has joined in upset that much of 
fujimoris support comes from perus small but growing evangelical 
community the catholic church has attacked the evangelicals and 
analysts say fujimori is the real target 
the campaign against fujimori has received wide coverage by 
limas provargas llosa television stations in little more than a 
month the novelist turned a 13point deficit into a 5point lead 
among voters in this city of 7 million 
but for vargas llosa the televised offensive has limits because 
fewer than half of perus 22 million people have access to 
television 
the antivargas llosa sentiment is especially strong in limas 
sprawling shantytowns and the impoverished countryside 
in the brutal campaign for the firstround elections garcias 
aprista party painted the novelist as the candidate of the rich 
white elite 
the effort was largely successful according to pollsters 
vargas llosas harsh antileft rhetoric also frightened away 
potential supporters among perus traditionally leftleaning 
electorate 
the result is a voting population deeply split along class lines 
most of vargas llosas gain has been among limas upper and 
middle classes the poor remain solidly opposed to him apparently 
unimpressed by the novelists recent campaign sweeps through their 
dusty shantytowns 
the poor are going to vote for the little chinaman said 
ina ramirez 23 a sidewalk vendor of used clothing referring to 
fujimori by his nickname that other man is for the rich 
as fujimori has become more aware of his constituency his 
rhetoric has become more populist he promises to simultaneously 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs and sharply cut perus 2000 
percent annual inflation he doesnt say how hell do it 
the winner will inherit an economy ravaged by hyperinflation and 
a bankrupt government paralyzed by strikes 
and in recent years the maoist shining path rebels have spread 
from their mountain stronghold throughout much of peru political 
violence has claimed more than 18500 lives over the past decade

west german chancellor helmut kohl says a 
reunified germany will be anything but neutral and isolationist 
instead seeking a central role in a new european security order 
in his first speech since the superpower summit kohl also 
forcefully reiterated his commitment to a united germany maintaining 
close ties with the united states through nato membership 
we do not want to be forced into isolation because our 
experience shows that this leads to a loss of stability and peace in 
europe he told about 5000 people tuesday night at a dinner held 
by the 38yearold american council on germany 
we do not seek neutrality or demilitarization and we reject a 
nonaligned status said kohl he called continued close ties with 
the united states of vital importance to the germans 
kohl acknowledged the anxiety most strongly expressed by 
soviets over a strong and united german state of 80 million people 
at the heart of europe the soviet union lost 20 million people in 
world war ii 
this has been a terrible century with wars with tears and the 
germans had a part in this the west german leader said 
but he said let me tell you you can trust the germans he 
said they want a central role in creating a europe of closer 
economic and political cooperation 
we germans are determined to go this road so we can prove that 
we have learned the lessons of history kohl said peace must 
emanate from the soil of germany 
kohl arrived in the united states on tuesday for a fourday 
visit he was to meet with wall street executives today deliver the 
commencement address at harvard university on thursday day and meet 
with president bush at the white house on friday 
while reiterating his commitment to nato kohl expressed 
gratitude to bush for clearly stating with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at his side on sunday that it is the right 
of the germans that they should alone determine what alliance they 
want to be a member of 
the soviet union opposes the membership of a reunified germany in 
the western military alliance and the soviet and us leaders made 
little progress on the issue during the washington summit 
kohl offered no new proposals on how to satisfy soviet concerns 
the stalemate is stymying progress on the reduction of conventional 
and nuclear forces in europe including the withdrawal of the 
380000 soviet troops from east germany 
he noted that poland hungary and czechoslovakia endorse a united 
germanys membership in nato as promoting european security all 
three are in the sovietled warsaw pact a military alliance that is 
falling apart now that its members are stripping the communists of 
power 
kohl expressed support for proposals endorsed by soviet leaders 
for a stronger role for the 35nation conference on security and 
cooperation in europe as a forum for greater understanding and 
cooperation among nations 
us officials have expressed concern that a stronger csce could 
supplant nato and the warsaw pact and kohl stressed that he did not 
envision the western alliance crumbling as a result

the leaders of albania say the ruling 
communist party now stands ready to accept criticism and advice from 
the people but they ruled out ending the partys political monopoly 
albanias staterun ata news agency in a dispatch from the 
countrys capital of tirana tuesday quoted remarks by communist 
party leader ramiz alia and nexhmija hoxa widow of enver hoxa the 
founder of communist albania 
it quoted the two as urging the countrys communistdominated 
democratic front mass organization to be more independent of the 
ruling party 
the countrys leaders have in recent weeks begun to move away 
from the rigid stalinism that has made albania the most controlled 
and isolated country in europe during the postwar period 
like similar organizations set up elsewhere in eastern europe 
where communists consolidated power after world war ii the 
democratic front was set up in albania ostensibly to give 
noncommunists a forum 
but in albania the fronts real function was to endorse 
communist policies 
ms hoxa the fronts chairwoman was quoted by ata as saying 
that albanians are invited to the open party meetings with the 
right of demanding explanations and discussing on an equal footing 
with the communists 
the fact that the masses are invited and urged not only to have 
their say but to have the power to make decisions testified to the 
great political trust the party has in them she was quoted as 
saying 
in separate comments alia urged front members to show more 
independence saying it is only natural that there will be a 
diversity of opinions even a pluralist treatment of issues within 
the organization the agency said 
ms hoxha however drew clear lines as to how far pluralism 
could go rejecting artificially created parties which represent 
nobody ata said 
albania has moved this spring to reform some of the most 
restrictive aspects of its social and economic system while 
pledging to open itself more to the outside world 
officials have said that travel abroad difficult if not 
impossible for decades would be made freer for average citizens 
they also abolished the death penalty for those trying to flee 
the country and announced they were seeking to establish ties to 
european organizations and mend relations with the superpowers 
religion officially banned for decades has again become 
acceptable ms hoxha emphasized the new stance at the meeting ata 
said quoting her as saying the right to believe or not is a 
matter of conscience for everybody

house speaker don avenson rode a 
prochoice abortion campaign to the democratic nomination for 
governor foreshadowing a general election debate on abortion with 
republican gov terry branstad 
you have nominated yourself a tiger a tiger for the ordinary 
people avenson told cheering supporters as he claimed victory in 
tuesdays primary 
avenson outdistanced an antiabortion democrat attorney general 
tom miller and another prochoice candidate former banker john 
chrystal avenson was strongly supported by prochoice groups 
with 99 percent of the states precincts reporting avenson had 
78767 votes or 39 percent to millers 63129 or 32 percent and 
chrystals 52031 or 26 percent two minor candidates split the 
remainder 
chrystal said the prochoice groups particularly the national 
abortion rights action league had made the difference for avenson 
narals endorsement really brought votes to avenson chrystal 
said 
branstad opposes abortion and faced no primary contest 
avenson said he will turn immediately to the uphill fight in 
november he conceded that branstad has a huge financial edge 
branstad has raised more than 25 million while avenson is 
essentially broke he said he has pledges for 65000 to begin the 
fight 
branstad responded to the primary results by sounding a theme 
likely to be repeated this fall that avenson had won with the help 
of a typical specialinterest type of support 
miller urged his backers to unite behind avenson and all three 
democratic candidates called for party unity 
put the primary behind us its over miller said ill do 
anything i can to help win this campaign to win the governors 
race this is the end of one campaign but the beginning of another 
shelley bain of the iowa naral affiliate said voters will now 
have a choice over abortion policy in the november governors race 
still she insisted that other issues had played a role in avensons 
victory 
abortion she said was important but it wasnt everything 
abortion foes discounted the election saying miller waffled on 
the issue and didnt make a strong appeal 
tom miller was really at best a weak candidate from the 
prolife standpoint said mona smit of the iowa right to life 
committee our position is naral didnt beat miller tom miller

fall campaign against republican challenger christine todd whitman 
after swamping an unknown in the democratic primary 
with 5290 of 5845 precincts reporting in tuesdays democratic 
primary the twoterm senator had 176213 votes or 93 percent to 
14235 votes or 7 percent for daniel seyler 
mrs whitman who was unopposed drew 98153 votes with 5289 
precincts reporting 
bradley indicated tuesday night that he was taking nothing for 
granted despite being the overwhelming favorite in the general 
election and having amassed a 10 millionplus warchest 75 percent 
of it from out of state 
you take every race youre in seriously just like you took 
every game you were in seriously said the former new york knicks 
basketball star 
the surprise of the primary was the 12th district gop upset in 
the battle to succeed retiring rep james courter who decided not 
to run for reelection after losing the gubernatorial race to 
democrat jim florio 
former new york giants wide receiver phil mcconkey pulled into 
second place dividing the moderate vote and allowing state sen 
richard a zimmer a fiscal conservative and environmentalist to 
defeat the favorite assemblymen rodney frelinghuysen and grab the 
party nomination 
zimmer will face democrat marguerite chandler on the november 
ballot 
camden democrat robert andrews easily won a fourway contest for 
the nomination to seek florios congressional seat in the 1st 
district 
he faces gloucester county freeholder daniel mangini who ran 
unopposed for the gop nomination in november 
andrews also won the partys nomination to run in the special 
election to serve the rest of florios eighth term which ends in 
january 
mrs whitman has vowed to run a clean issuesoriented race but 
some political observers believe her campaign could tarnish bradley 
as a future presidential contender 
bradley 46 continued to sidestep talk that he might seek the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1992 saying he planned to 
serve out his sixyear senate term if he wins reelection 
during the primary campaign mrs whitman 43 focused on 
bradleys campaign spending she expects to spend 15 million 
mrs whitman entered her first race for statewide elected office 
after the state gop took a battering in last years gubernatorial 
election but denied she agreed to run in exchange for party support 
in a future bid for governor

new jersey joined a dozen states where courts have struck down 
schoolfunding systems for shortchanging the poor in one of those 
states texas an educationfinance overhaul package was speeding 
through the legislature 
in a 70 ruling tuesday new jerseys supreme court ordered 
lawmakers to ensure by the 199192 school year that poor districts 
are able to spend about as much per student as wealthier districts 
in the 13 millionstudent system 
the decision is widely expected to force lawmakers to raise 
taxes as has happened in kentucky arkansas wyoming and other 
states texas house and senate approved tax increases tuesday 
the wave of court orders rejecting the way states fund schools is 
a legacy of the richgetricher poorgetpoorer 1980s one expert 
said 
since 1980 the gap between rich districts and poor districts 
has been increasing thats why we have this trend the poor are 
more hardpressed than they were during the 1970s said arthur 
wise director of the washingtonbased rand center for the study of 
the teaching profession 
in most states schools are supported primarily by local property 
taxes the new jersey court found the setup unconstitutional it 
ruled in effect that determining school funding based on property 
tax revenue is unfair 
the evidence compels but one conclusion the poorer the 
district and the greater its need the less the money available and 
the worse the education chief justice robert n wilentz wrote 
these students simply cannot possibly enter the same market or the 
same society as their peers educated in wealthier districts 
the court estimated the state needs to add 440 million to its 
35 billion schools budget to end the disparities lawmakers may 
devise any remedy they wish but cannot force poor districts to raise 
property taxes the court said 
gov jim florio called the ruling a clear victory for the 
children of new jersey 
the court has recognized that the current school funding system 
is leading us to be two new jerseys where some youngsters head for 
the best colleges and others go down a road to nowhere he said 
the governor last week unveiled a plan to increase income taxes 
to raise 1 billion for more aid to middleincome and poor 
districts under the plan aid to wealthier school systems would be 
reduced or eliminated 
state supreme courts in montana kentucky and texas have struck 
down schoolfunding systems in the past 18 months courts also have 
overturned funding systems in kansas wisconsin california 
connecticut washington west virginia wyoming and arkansas 
lawsuits are pending in several other states including alaska 
connecticut and oregon 
i think we are reentering a period of school finance 
litigation said chris pipho director of state relations for the 
denverbased education commission of the states 
the texas supreme court in october declared that states system 
unconstitutional and lawmakers have been meeting under a court 
deadline since february to devise a remedy 
on tuesday the senate approved and sent to the house a 528 
million education reform bill and both chambers passed a bill that 
would raise sales taxes by a quartercent and increase taxes on 
mixed drinks and tobacco to pay for the reforms 
the kentucky supreme court overturned that states funding system 
last year forcing lawmakers to raise taxes to pay for 500 million 
more in education aid 
the education law center in newark nj filed the lawsuit in 
1981 that led to tuesdays ruling on behalf of children in such poor 
areas as camden jersey city and east orange former gov thomas h 
kean had fought the lawsuit and defended the funding system 
the court found that in 1984 new jersey districts spent an 
average of 4030 per pupil while the poorest school systems spent 
only about 2860 per pupil 
the fact is that a large part of our society is disintegrating 
so large a part that it cannot help but affect the rest the court 
said everyones future is at stake and not just the poors

the soviet government news agency has sought to 
reassure north korea that the kremlin will not let its relations 
with the communist state be damaged by soviet moves to establish 
ties with south korea 
tass said in a commentary tuesday that mikhail s gorbachevs 
meeting with president roh taewoo of south korea had been described 
by western media as a political sensation marking drastic 
changes in moscows asia policy 
the commentary by political analyst yuri kornilov did not 
specify which news outlets were making those claims 
roh told reporters after meeting the soviet leader in san 
francisco monday that the two countries would establish diplomatic 
ties 
but gorbachev was vague on the prospects of south koreansoviet 
ties saying only we will let the fruit grow ripe and when the 
fruit grows ripe we will eat it 
the tass commentary was an effort to reassure north korea that 
the soviet union has no intention of doing anything to hurt its 
relations with the communist state which is ruled by kim il sung 
kornilov said the rohgorbachev meeting was a sensation only 
because it was the first between leaders of the soviet union and 
south korea not because it signals any change in soviet policy 
as to prospects for the establishment of diplomatic relations 
of which much is being written and said in the west nowadays the 
soviet stand is well known and remains unchanged this issue can be 
considered only in connection with further improvement of the 
situation in the korean peninsula 
kornilov continued 
of course the removal of ideological blinkers from our foreign 
policy and the course towards broader economic contacts and 
political dialogue with other countries in no way means that we give 
up our principled positions and priorities or forgo the interests of 
third countries 
and he reassured north korea our country will continue to 
maintain and promote in all ways its traditionally close political 
economic and other ties with north korea 
the tass analyst said the soviet union continues to support north 
korean proposals for peace on the peninsula 
korea was divided in 1945 at the end of world war ii when soviet 
and us troops ended japans colonial rule the division deepened 
after the two koreas fought a war in 195053 
in south korea newspapers reported today that the countrys 
foreign minister choi hojoong plans to visit moscow next month to 
discuss terms of establishing formal ties 
donga ilbo and joongang ilbo in dispatches by correspondents 
who accompanied roh on his us visit said choi plans to meet 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze they said shevardnadze 
would then be invited to visit seoul about a month later to finalize 
terms for opening formal diplomatic relations 
roh was to meet with president bush in washington today 
despite the lack of diplomatic relations south korea and the 
soviet union have greatly increased trade and investment in recent 
years 
their trade jumped 10 times from 1985 to 600 million last year 
and is expected to top 1 billion this year

the corporate merger of the northern and 
southern branches of the presbyterian church in 1983 has become a 
theological merger 
cheers rang out at the salt palace in this mormon heartland after 
commissioners to the 202nd general assembly of the presbyterian 
church usa approved 49925 a new statement of faith tuesday 
that combines traditional christian beliefs with contemporary 
concerns for the environment and sexual equality 
for the first time this denomination speaks for itself as a 
theological body that to me is of epochal significance said the 
rev m douglas harper a houston pastor who served on the drafting 
committee 
if the document is approved by twothirds of the denominations 
177 regional presbyteries and again by the 1991 general assembly it 
will become the 11th statement of faith in the 29 millionmember 
churchs book of confessions 
the new statement of faith is the denominations first since the 
merger healed a 122yearold split dating to the civil war and the 
slavery issue 
as far as we know this is the first confession of the church 
that declares as a matter of faith women are called to all 
ministries of the church said jane dempsey douglass 
vicechairwoman of the drafting committee 
the confession also likens god to both a mother who will not 
forsake her nursing child and a father who runs to welcome the 
prodigal home 
on the environment the confession says humans deserve gods 
condemnation for the way they threaten death to the planet 
entrusted to our care 
at the same time the statement upholds centuriesold church 
teachings that jesus christ was both fully human and fully god and 
that god raised jesus from the dead to offer eternal life 
some church leaders said the confession is vital for the 
denomination which has lost a third of its members in the past 
quarter century amid criticism it lacked a strong identity 
the theological integrity of the presbyterian church depends on 
the statement of faith said the rev jack l stotts chairman of 
the committee that developed the confession 
in other business the assembly voted to allocate 1 million for 
a fiveyear program to set up selfhelp programs for black men the 
church is less than 2 percent black 
the church leaders also voted 39552 to work toward normalized 
relations with cuba including reducing trade and travel 
restrictions a call for free elections there was defeated

prosecutors today weighed criminal 
charges against a doctor who hooked an alzheimers patient to a 
poisoninjecting suicide machine that let her take her life with the 
press of a button 
janet adkins a 54yearold portland ore woman died monday 
after traveling 2000 miles to use the device built by dr jack 
kevorkian a retired pathologist and outspoken advocate of what he 
calls doctorassisted suicide 
her last words to me were something like thank you thank you 
very much he said i wished her a good trip and as i leaned 
over her she seemed like she was rising to meet me perhaps to give 
me a kiss of gratitude 
the 62yearold suburban detroit doctor also said the woman told 
him you just make my case known 
as it became known prosecutors considered whether it was illegal 
and medical professionals debated whether it was ethical 
prosecutors seized the machine and said they would seek a court 
order today banning use of the device while the case is considered 
there are many issues here county prosecutor richard 
thompson said tuesday suicide is not a crime in michigan but 
its not the desire of the deceased thats in question its the 
actions of those involved 
case law in michigan is unclear on whether assisting a suicide is 
a crime thompson said in oregon providing the means to commit 
suicide is a felony 
mrs adkins husband called the device humane and said his wife 
had the right to take her life 
she loved life she just lived life to the fullest ron 
adkins said tuesday in portland she was a powerful woman and she 
was an intelligent woman i was the weak one she was strong she 
had made up her mind 
adkins released a note his wife had written i have alzheimers 
disease and do not want to let it progress any farther i dont 
choose to put my family or myself through the agony of this terrible 
disease 
one of the couples three sons neil told kgwtv in portland 
she was in a very good state of mind thats the amazing thing it 
was not a desperate thing or a depressed situation she was the one 
that helped us all through it 
diana smith of the hemlock society which advocates suicide 
rights said its unfortunate that mrs adkins had to go so far to 
get the assistance she desired smith said kevorkian used michigan 
as a testing ground because it is the only state that doesnt have 
specific laws against assisting a suicide 
some ethicists said the doctor acted in violation of the 
hippocratic oath 
physicians should not be killers even in cases where the 
patient requests it and there is a compassionate reason behind the 
act said susan wolf of the hastings center for biomedical 
research in briarcliff ny 
they take an oath to do no harm and taking a life is doing 
harm 
kevorkian said the adkinses members of the national hemlock 
society traveled to michigan with a friend on friday on monday he 
drove her in his van to a park her husband stayed behind at the 
couples motel 
she was anxious and didnt want to delay kevorkian said 
but she was the calm the calmest one involved with the 
procedure i can tell you from experience it was rough 
kevorkian said he and one of his relatives attached mrs adkins 
to a heart monitor then put an intravenous tube in her arm the 
machine consists of a motor and an aluminum frame from which tubes 
of chemicals are suspended 
the tube first delivered a saline solution kevorkian said mrs 
adkins then pressed a button that injected thiopental a 
comainducing drug followed moments later by potassium chloride 
which stops the heart within minutes 
he said she was unconscious in 25 seconds and died in five or six 
minutes 
after mrs adkins death kevorkian notified police who 
confiscated both his volkswagen van and the device 
mrs adkins was diagnosed with alzheimers a year ago and decided 
then she would end her life her 57yearold husband said 
alzheimers is a degenerative brain and nerve disorder that robs 
people of their memories and their ability to function an estimated 
4 million us adults mostly over age 65 have the disease 
kevorkian said he developed the device last fall inspired by a 
quadriplegic in michigan who fought 18 years for the right to die 
he died last year 
the doctor said in march that he expected to be prosecuted after 
the first use of the device he also said he would not charge 
patients and that he might use it to take his own life some day 
its dignified humane and painless and the patient can do it 
in the comfort of their own home at any time they want he said 
last year 
im here to help anybody whos in distress or thinks he is i 
couldnt let dogs suffer like that how can i let a human

more than 1500 independent 
british columbia truckers shouted down a settlement offer putting 
back into gear a strike that has slowed deliveries of food and fuel 
across the us border 
the truckers warned of new forms of protest after a court 
injunction forced them to stop using their rigs to block border 
crossings 
the settlement offer was presented to more than 1500 truckers 
tuesday night at a fairground in this vancouver suburb the truckers 
didnt even bother using ballots they were handed and overwhelmingly 
shouted the offer down 
more talks were set for today there are about 3000 independent 
truckers in british columbia about onequarter of all truckers in 
the province 
the proposal crafted with help from a mediator would have set a 
minimum hauling rate of 35 an hour going up to 40 by january the 
truckers want 40 now 
the independents who pay their own running costs and maintain 
their vehicles are paid 26 to 35 an hour 
earlier tuesday truckers removed their rigs blocking most 
commercial traffic at the border between washington state and 
british columbia the drivers were served with an injunction late 
monday 
the blockades had been in place since thursday at crossings north 
of blaine oroville sumas and lynden in washington and at two 
major canadian highways 
the blockades were the most serious in a series of escalating job 
actions since independent truckers went on strike in late may the 
roadblocks resulted in food and fuel shortages in the province and 
in point roberts a small washington state peninsula accessible 
overland only through british columbia 
the blockades also forced a burnaby truck manufacturer to lay off 
450 employees monday for lack of parts from the united states 
garnet zimmerman a spokesman for the teamsters union which 
supports striking members of the western owneroperators 
association said new job actions are planned 
organizers want truckers to set up protests at highway scale 
stations travel in convoys or gather their rigs at shopping malls 
to tell the public about their wage demands he said 
teamsters official don mcgill blamed the breakdown on several 
large trucking companies that he said have refused to come to the 
bargaining table 
about onethird of the 180 trucking companies in the dispute have 
been represented during talks mcgill said the truckers want all 
firms included in any contract 
last month independent truckers in ontario and quebec blocked 
border crossings costing the big three automakers millions of 
dollars and threatening food shortages the blockades were part of 
the truckers fight for higher rates

the los angeles county board of supervisors 
will appeal a federal judges ruling that it illegally diluted 
hispanic voting strength in drawing district boundaries in 1981 
the boards conservative majority voted 30 tuesday to continue 
the 2yearold 3 million court battle of the fivemember boards 
two liberal members one dissented but left before the vote and the 
other abstained 
conservative pete schabarum who is retiring accused us 
district judge david kenyon of exerting extraordinary personal 
bias in mondays ruling 
kenyon said the board members conspired to protect their 
incumbencies and that of their allies when they redrew the 
countys voting districts in 1981 
in so doing kenyon added the supervisors violated the 1965 
federal voting rights act and the equal protection clause of the 
14th amendment to the constitution 
a lawsuit filed in 1988 accused the supervisors of deliberately 
spreading the countys hispanic population across several districts 
the plaintiffs included a hispanic organization and the us justice 
department 
hispanics make up about 35 percent of the countys 87 million 
people no hispanic has been elected to the board in more than 100 
years 
kenyon scheduled a conference for thursday to discuss options 
such as ordering an immediate redrawing of district boundaries 
plaintiffs in the lawsuit have said the results of tuesdays 
elections in two districts should be thrown out

gov rudy perpich had the same question 
many others have asked why minnesota 
but unlike many others he got to ask mikhail gorbachev himself 
during the soviet presidents visit on sunday the answer warm 
feelings 
one of the first questions i asked was why did you pick 
minnesota perpich told a crowd tuesday at the family farm 
gorbachev dropped from his itinerary at the last minute 
he said i decided to come to minnesota then he talked about 
reasons why he came to minnesota he said over the years in various 
conversations and meetings hes had a warm feeling toward 
minnesota perpich said 
the soviet union has had had strong business to minnesota over 
the years buying such things as computers from control data corp 
perpich was at the dairy farm owned by richard and cecilia brand 
to watch the release of a bald eagle into the wild it had been 
hoped that gorbachev would release the bird himself to symbolize 
ussoviet friendship 
the bird had been captured march suffering from insecticide 
poisoning it had been recovering at the university of minnesotas 
raptor center before brand cradled it in his arms and tossed it to 
freedom 
im more comfortable with cows quipped brand a dairy farmer 
perpich said he did not know exactly why the farm visit was 
canceled but he offered lunch at the governors mansion for the 
brand family and all who helped out with the farm preparations to 
make up for the disappointment 
mrs brand said that would be very nice her husband emphasized 
that he was not bitter about being skipped 
at least i got some work done he said referring to the help 
he got from the advance team in sprucing up the farm brand said he 
spent more than 1000 to make the place look better and hire extra 
hands to do chores 
asked if the brands would be reimbursed the governor said he 
would bring it up with the committee that arranged the visit 
adding thats a good point

vandals broke into a high school painted swastikas 
on the walls and left behind bloodsoaked human skulls and bones 
police said today 
the vandalism was discovered tuesday when students returned after 
a threeday holiday weekend to the bernardpalissy high school in 
gien on the loire river about 75 miles south of paris 
the intruders who apparently climbed in through a window 
painted swastikas and jewish stars of david on the ground floor cut 
telephone cords then went to the second floor and left 
bloodcovered human bones including about six skulls police said 
slogans were written on the walls in german 
tests were being conducted to determine when the bones were dug 
up and where the blood came from 
there has been a wave of neonazi and antisemitic vandalism 
across france in the past four weeks following the discovery may 10 
of a macabre desecration at a jewish cemetery in the southern town 
of carpentras thirtyfour tombs there were vandalized and the body 
of an elderly man was dug up and impaled on an umbrella handle

when alzheimers patient janet adkins pressed the 
button on a suicide machine and chose death over mental 
degeneration she stirred debate over the ethics of euthanasia and 
sent prosecutors to the law books 
the 54yearold portland ore woman on monday became the first 
person to die using dr jack kevorkians suicide device after her 
husband of 34 years told her once more that he loved her mrs 
adkins had kevorkian hook her intravenously to the machine inside 
his van parked in a suburban park 
she hit the button comainducing thiopental and a lethal dose of 
potassium chloride dripped into her veins and within six minutes 
she was dead 
she and her husband ron were members of the hemlock society 
which supports the option of sucide for the terminally ill 
but assisting someones suicide is explicitly illegal in oregon 
the adkinses flew to michigan where the law is not so clear after 
they read about kevorkians device and after experimental 
alzheimers cures failed 
its unfortunate that mrs adkins had to go so far to get the 
assistance she desired hemlock society spokeswoman diana smith 
said from the groups office in eugene ore 
since michigan is the only state in the union that doesnt have 
specific laws against people who assist in suicide kevorkian used 
it as a testing ground smith said what happened monday kind of 
opens the door for seeing these laws are outdated and need to be 
changed 
other vehemently disagreed 
this ghoulish event illustrates the lengths that medicine can 
go once doctors violate the hippocratic oath and tradition which 
separates the killer from the caregiver said mary senander 
director of the international antieuthanasia task force of 
steubenville ohio 
the american medical association considers passive euthanasia 
ethical said lawyer reinhard priester of the center for biomedical 
ethics at the university of minnesota passive euthanasia might for 
example involve the withholding of food to a comatose patient 
believed to have no chance of recovery he said 
but priester said that kevorkian by arranging a suicide with the 
patients consent appeared to have participated in active 
euthanasia which the ama has deemed morally inappropriate 
clearly what he provided her is not something that would 
relieve her pain and suffering priester said the clear intent 
of providing those two chemicals was to hasten the patients death 
whether kevorkians action is legal in michigan is what oakland 
county prosecutor richard thompson is now trying to decide 
he said tuesday he believes a 1920 michigan supreme court 
decision makes abetting a suicide illegal although he hasnt 
decided whether to bring charges 
in 1920 the court upheld the murder conviction of a man who 
placed a bottle of poison within reach of his wife who wanted to 
commit suicide thompson said 
but a 1983 state court of appeals decision said a man who gave a 
gun to a friend who used it to commit suicide shouldnt have been 
charged he said 
the state supreme court refused to hear the 1983 case saying 
that if the 1920 decision were no longer the law of the land then 
it was the high court that should have made the decision it did 
not thompson said 
kevorkian a longtime advocate of euthanasia said tuesday he 
expected to be prosecuted what i am doing was ethical even in 
hippocrates day i guess highly emotional people would call it 
murder he said

a woman who refuses to tell a judge the 
whereabouts of her two granddaughters has begun serving a sentence 
at a missingchildrens agency 
the judge said he hoped 15 hours a week at the agency would 
persuade 76yearold mary pigeon to lead authorities to the girls 
and their mother who left their warwick home five years ago 
i dont know where she is pigeon said tuesday after leaving 
work at the society for young victims a small office across from 
city hall with photos of missing children plastered across the 
windows i wish i knew 
pigeon has said that all along but superior court judge mark 
pfeiffer said he absolutely has evidence pigeon knows where her 
daughter took the children and he imposed the sentence monday in 
hopes of forcing her to comply 
elaine yates left home in 1985 with her daughters 3yearold 
kimberly and 10monthold kelly after she found her husband in bed 
with another woman 
russell yates jr was awarded custody of his daughters after his 
wife failed to return to contest his request he then sued his 
motherinlaw to compel her to disclose the whereabouts of the 
children 
last july pfeiffer ruled that pigeon took part in the abduction 
and knew where her daughter and grandchildren were he found her in 
contempt 
the judge said he hoped pigeons time at the newport agency would 
show her the anguish parents of missing children endure 
if she sees firsthand working at this center 60 hours a month 
the kind of harm this does to families hopefully within her 
conscience she will come forward pfeiffer said 
the judge will call pigeon back into court june 29 to review the 
case yates attorney neil philbin said if she does not cooperate 
then he will push the judge to jail her as he did this week as 
well

rumors that a release was imminent circulated in beijing last 
week the government waited until after the anniversary sunday and 
monday of last years army attack on studentled protesters in 
beijing in which hundreds and possibly thousands of people died 
soldiers and police patrolled beijing in force on both days to 
head off any commemorative protests and were largely successful 
the only major incident a rally sunday night by hundreds of 
beijing university students was confined to the campus students on 
other campuses expressed their anger by smashing beer bottles and 
several nonstudents held small protests near tiananmen square 
xinhua said the 97 were given lenient treatment after having 
voluntarily confessed their wrongdoings and expressed a 
willingness to repent none had been charged or tried 
those who obstinately stick to an incorrect course and refuse 
to repent will be punished strictly in accordance with the law 
xinhua said 
the protests last year began as a student movement and escalated 
into a massive nationwide outcry against the communist partys 
heavyhanded ad increasingly corrupt rule 
senior leader deng xiaoping and other aging revolutionaries who 
ordered the crackdown maintain that a small group of plotters 
orchestrated the protests in an effort to topple the party 
they have rejected western descriptions of the jailed protesters 
as political prisoners and sentenced many to long terms twenty 
people have been executed according to official reports and many 
more by unofficial accounts 
the releases did not signify a softening on the part of the 
party but an attempt to put the turmoil behind it ease deepseated 
domestic anger over the crackdown and restore badly damaged 
relations with the west 
many of those freed earlier remain under forms of probation and 
many have lost their jobs or been expelled from school harsh 
punishment in a system where most jobs are assigned 
china announced in january that it had freed 573 people and in 
may that a second group of 211 were released including several 
wellknown academics and a famous journalist dai qing 
it said then that only 431 people were still being held for 
investigation that figure left thousands unaccounted for 
suggesting that it did not include those already sentenced 
among the most prominent people still jailed are chen zimin the 
head of a nongovernment social research institute that has since 
been closed down liu xiaobo 34 a college lecturer and bao 
zunxin a fellow at the institute of history of the chinese academy 
of social sciences 
six students on the mostwanted list are known to be still 
jailed five escaped abroad and the whereabouts of eight are not 
known

forces loyal to prince nordom sihanouk 
were engaged in heavy combat inside cambodia today despite 
sihanouks pledge a day earlier that his guerrillas no longer would 
fight in the 11yearold conflict 
rocket and artillery fire could be heard from this thai border 
province as sihanouk forces engaged those of the hun sen government 
in cambodia 
there is heavy fighting now said roland eng spokesman for 
sihanouks guerrilla faction nothing will change for now in 
tokyo there was only an agreement not implementation of a 
ceasefire the fighting will continue 
sihanouk and premier hun sen signed a communique in tokyo on 
tuesday that said cambodias warring factions should refrain from 
all offensive actions and that there should be measures to ensure 
a military standstill 
although the vaguely worded communique fell short of being a 
ceasefire agreement sihanouk told a news conference that his own 
forces and those of his noncommunist ally the khmer peoples 
national liberation front would not take part in fighting inside 
cambodia 
sihanouk said the war would continue between hun sen forces and 
the thrid faction of his resistance coalition the communist khmer 
rouge which boycotted the tokyo conference sessions and did not 
sign the communique 
in tokyo japanese foreign minister taro nakayama said japan 
still hopes the khmer rouge will join the agreement he said japan 
will ask for chinese and thai help to bring the radical faction into 
a ceasefire news reports said 
china is the main backer of the khmer rouge 
the way is always open for the khmer rouge to join the joint 
agreement kyodo news service quoted nakayama as saying today 
in bangkok soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev said he 
hoped further cambodian peace talks expected to be held in paris 
this summer could result in a freezing of arms supplies to all sides 
in the conflict 
eng said no orders had been received from sihanouk in tokyo to 
halt battlefield activity he said it was his understanding that the 
tokyo communique would not actually go into effect until a later 
date 
guerrilla sources said cambodian government troops were trying to 
push back a 2000man guerrilla offensive that seized much of a 
strategic highway in bantey meanchey province in northwestern 
cambodia 
in recent days press releases from sihanouks group in thailand 
have claimed major victories in that province and other areas of 
cambodia one release said that on tuesday two of sihanouks units 
staged raids on samrong the capital of bantey meanchey 
in addition western diplomats and thai intelligence sources have 
confirmed some khmer rouge claims of major victories inside cambodia 
in recent days

president hashemi rafsanjani said today that 
washington must pressure israel and kuwait to free moslem prisoners 
if it wants help in gaining the release of the 16 westerners held by 
kidnappers in lebanon 
the irresponsible arrogant attitude of the united states has 
created further difficulties in resolving the hostage crisis the 
turbaned rafsanjani told a news conference for 200 foreign and local 
journalists 
irans leaders and shiite leaders in lebanon have often demanded 
that the united states urge israel to release 350 moslem prisoners 
held in israel and in israels selfdeclared security zone in 
southern lebanon 
however it was the first time in some months that an iranian 
leader referred to 15 shiite moslems jailed in kuwait in 1984 for 
car bombings in that country that killed five people and wounded 86 
two american educators robert polhill and frank reed were 
released by their proiranian kidnappers at tehrans bidding in 
april and iran said washington should make a gesture in return 
an appropriate response was expected after the lebanese 
unconditionally set free the hostages release of hostages in 
kuwait and israel rafsanjani said without elaborating 
why dont you help increase the necessary public pressure on 
those governments to release these hostages so that the western 
hostages can be freed in return the iranian president asked the 
journalists 
if the united states is serious about wanting relations with 
iran in the future it must begin to act because talking is not 
enough he added 
polhill and reed were the first us captives to be released in 
3 years six americans are among the 16 westerners still held by 
proiranian kidnappers in lebanon the longestheld is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was abducted in march 1985 
rafsanjani also said he did not rule out a peace summit with 
president saddam hussein of iraq but he said that will happen only 
after lowerlevel iraqiiranian meetings are held to discuss 
reaching a permanent settlement to the persian gulf war which ended 
in a ceasefire in august 1988 
referring to irans death threats against british author salman 
rushdie he said ties with london could be resumed if prime minister 
margaret thatcher condemns his book the satanic verses but he 
said there was no question of lifting the death decree on rushdie 
whose book iran says defames islam 
rafsanjani said irans policy was to help secure the release of 
all the hostages whether they be western lebanese or iranian 
the iranian president reiterated his countrys claim that four 
iranians two diplomats a journalist and a driver who were 
kidnapped by the christian lebanese forces militia in 1982 are still 
alive 
we have learned officially from a government and from reliable 
sources in east beirut that the iranian hostages are alive 
rafsanjani said the special envoy of a certain government has 
informed us 
he did not identify the country 
the bush administration recently provided iran with information 
through the swiss government which it said indicated the four men 
had been killed 
sources in the lebanese forces have said the iranians were killed 
soon after they were seized rafsanjani has said repeatedly that if 
the west wants help in releasing hostages it must help determine 
the fate of the four

the government today proposed legislation that would 
give france one of the worlds toughest antismoking laws and impose 
a total ban on tobacco ads in 1993 
the bill approved today by the cabinet also would severely 
restrict advertising for alcoholic beverages ads for hard liquor 
would be allowed only in publications geared specifically toward 
adults and must carry a message about the health hazards of drinking 
under the law expected to win easy approval in the national 
assembly cigarette packs will have to carry a health warning and 
smoking will be banned in a wide range of public places 
a separate bill is expected to be introduced soon that would 
raise cigarette prices by 15 percent the biggest single increase 
ever in france the government sets cigarette prices 
100000 people die prematurely in france each year because of 
tobacco and excess alcohol consumption said cabinet spokesman 
louis le pensac this is an intolerable human social and economic 
cost 
under the legislation submitted by health minister claude evin 
all direct and indirect tobacco advertising will be banned as of 
jan 1 1993 including the sponsorship of sports and cultural 
events by tobacco companies 
even the use of cigarette trademarks as logos on nontobacco 
items such as clothing or luggage will be banned le pensac said 
cigarette manufacturers have contended that a ban on tobacco 
advertising would not affect consumption but they estimate the 
proposed price increase will lower sales by 10 percent 
ironically the government is a major producer of cigarettes the 
governments wholly owned tobacco company produces such brands as 
gauloises and gitanes and controls about 51 percent of the cigarette 
market

nbc affiliate executives wrap up their 
firstever convention today but capitol hill likely will be hearing 
from them again 
the executives will be doing followups to their mass visit 
tuesday with their congressmen and senators on broadcasting issues 
said cyril vetter a spokesman for the group 
about 300 of them went to capitol hill some for the first time 
seeking help for their stations and nbc in competing with cable and 
hollywood studios 
the trip was made because we wanted to be more of a part of the 
legislative process than we have in the past said vetter a baton 
rouge la broadcaster who heads nbcs affiliate government affairs 
board 
the march on congress had two basic goals said vetter 
one was to urge support for a possible change in federal 
communications commission rules barring networks from the lucrative 
program syndication market and from a financial interest in shows 
others produce 
the fcc may begin reconsideration of those rules on june 14 
unless the networks can work out a compromise on them with hollywood 
studios and producers 
nbc station executives also sought help from congress in 
resolving a problem bothering many stations the transmission of 
their broadcast signals by cable systems that arent now required by 
law to pay for the signals 
this is the beginning of the process of getting our oar in the 
water said pep cooney president of kpnxtv in phoenix 
he spoke after leading a delegation of arizona and new mexico 
station officials to the office of sen dennis decontini dariz 
the scene there was similar to 26 other regional gatherings on 
capitol hill where congressmen and senators were shown an 
eightminute videotape outlining the affiliates problems 
the tape portrayed the networks as unfairly bound by rules that 
dont apply to the major studios and a strong cable industry that is 
steadily taking viewers away from the networks and their local 
stations 
cooney described the visits as educational he said the 
affiliates werent seeking legislation but were trying to get 
congress to join the process of making a level playing field 
that would equalize the competition between the networks and their 
rivals

the bush administration seeking to quiet the 
clamor over government funding of allegedly obscene art will seek a 
oneyear interim budget for the national endowment for the arts 
instead of five years a white house spokeswoman said today 
deputy press secretary alixe glen called it the prudent thing 
to do 
it will allow an independent commission time to review the arts 
agencys grantmaking procedures she said 
the white house had been seeking a fiveyear budget 
reauthorization for the arts agency with no restrictions on its 
grantmaking procedures 
but conservatives on capitol hill have sought to write new 
restrictions into law to prevent the agency from patronizing what 
they view as obscene or blasphemous art such as exhibits of the 
late robert mapplethorpes homoerotic photographs or andres 
serranos shot of a crucifix in urine 
president bush has said previously he opposed legal restrictions 
on the neas grantmaking authority but preferred to rely on the 
good judgment of nea chairman john frohnmayer 
a 12member advisory commission was meeting today for the first 
time to review the agencys grantmaking procedures 
by calling for a oneyear reauthorization we are basically 
doing the prudent thing said ms glen 
she said that this approach is intended to ensure that the arts 
endowment does not run out of funds over the next year and it 
provides the independent arts commission time to do its study and 
report back to the president 
given the political climate this isnt something we want to do 
hastily she said 
our position remains that we would like to see a fiveyear 
clean reauthorization with no restrictions she said but that did 
not appear possible now 
the oneyear plan was decided upon at a meeting tuesday including 
white house officials and frohnmayer who told the washington post 
it affords a chance to come up with a reasonable solution rather 
than a hysterical response 
the endowment has been embroiled in debate over federal funding 
of the arts and freedom of expression since june 1989 because of 
grants awarded for an exhibit of mapplethorpe photographs that some 
considered obscene 
congress affixed restrictions on obscene art to the neas 
fiscal 1990 appropriation drawing protests over the 
constitutionality of the language

california voters approved the states largest 
tax increase ever in doubling gas taxes to pay for an 185 billion 
freeway construction program 
proposition 111 a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began with 
passage of proposition 13 in 1978 was approved tuesday along with a 
companion measure to provide 1 billion in bond funding for commuter 
trains 
california voters also rejected two redistricting measures that 
would have helped republicans an ethicsingovernment proposition 
won by a wide margin and a prosecutorsponsored initiative to 
shorten trials narrow defendants rights and expand the death 
penalty was approved 
in local elections san francisco voters approved a record 332 
million bond issue to help pay for repairs from last octobers 
earthquake voters in two san francisco bay area counties alameda 
and marin voted down measures to create or strengthen nuclear 
free zones 
known for its sun surf and celebrities malibu added cityhood to 
its string of alliterative claims to fame residents of the fabled 
seaside community voted to break free from los angeles countys 
direct rule by incorporating as a city in a lopsided vote 3797 to 
708 
the chic neighborhoods residents include such highprofile 
personalities as johnny carson michael landon martin sheen 
shirley maclaine and olivia newton john 
but the stars for the most part sat the election out 
preferring to let the beach community residents decide their own 
fate without celebrity influence playing an undue role 
with 91 percent of precincts reporting proposition 111 the 
highway and rail building proposal that raises gasoline taxes from 9 
to 18 cents and championed by gov george deukmejian and a coalition 
of business and labor gained approval 53 percent to 47 percent 
the measure proved most popular in the freewaylaced urban 
regions rural voters showed they solidly disliked the measure 
proposition 111s companion measure proposition 108 won 
approval 56 percent to 44 percent 
voters also approved proposition 116 a 199 billion bond levy 
for masstransit rail building by 53 percent to 47 percent 
voters rebuffed gop leaders by a roughly 21 margin two measures 
they hoped would reign in the democrats ability to use 
redistricting to maintain or increase their strength in the 
legislature and congress 
its sad for california this wasnt a republican party 
measure this was a people measure said state republican chairman 
frank visco 
republicans called the measures longoverdue reforms to an unjust 
system assembly speaker willie brown and other democrats labeled 
the initiatives gop power plays 
an ethics proposition won a clearcut victory 63 percent to 37 
percent 
lawmakers put proposition 112 on the ballot last september to 
help restore public confidence in the legislature in the wake of an 
fbi corruption probe that resulted in the conviction of one state 
senator and the indictment of a state tax board member who is a 
former lawmaker 
this is outstanding news the voters are going to get control 
of their government again said jim wheaton executive director of 
california common cause 
the measure prohibits legislators and other state elected 
officials from receiving speaking fees requires the legislature to 
pass laws banning or strictly limiting gifts to elected state 
officials calls for tougher conflictofinterest penalties for 
legislators and directs the legislature to prohibit legislators and 
state officials from lobbying for a year after leaving office 
california prosecutors scored a political victory by getting 
voters to approve their speedy trial initiative proposition 115 by 
57 to 43 percent 
the measure repeals independent state constitutional rights for 
criminal defendants shortens court proceedings particularly 
preliminary hearings and questioning of prospective jurors allows 
16yearold killers to be sentenced to life without parole and 
expands the states death penalty law for the first time since 1978 
backers called on the voters to finish the job that started with 
the 1986 removal of chief justice rose bird and two state supreme 
court colleagues the first california justices defeated in 50 
years many provisions of the initiative overturn rulings of the 
liberal bird court 
opponents predicted rushing criminal cases to trial will push 
civil suits aside and that the changes will cause chaos and 
constitutional challenges

mayor lionel wilson lost his bid for a 
fourth term apparently the victim of a botched attempt to return 
the raiders football team to their birthplace in oakland 
none of his seven rivals in the nonpartisan election won a 
majority forcing a runoff in november between the two top 
votegetters state assemblyman elihu harris and city councilman 
wilson riles jr 
wilson the underdog going into the election came in third 
harris had 32830 votes or 46 percent riles had 17607 votes or 
25 percent and wilson had 12232 votes or 17 percent 
as the early returns came in wilson had said he was confident he 
would face harris in arunoff but was prepared for disappointment 
when i get into any game i get into it to win but i also 
understand the realities of politics he said 
the raiders move to los angeles in 1982 dealt a crushing blow to 
oaklands pride but many residents opposed expensive proposals this 
year to lure them back 
wilson 75 a former judge who has been mayor for 16 years had 
initially backed a proposal that offered raiders owner al davis 602 
million including guaranteed ticket income and upfront payments 
critics charged the city and alameda county would have to pay 
millions if raiders games didnt sell out 
in april after 15 months of negotiations with the team wilson 
and the city council withdrew the proposal prompted by a petition 
drive that gathered 30000 signatures to put the deal on the city 
ballot 
a recent joint poll by the tribune and the gallup organization 
showed that 63 percent of voters dont think a deal to bring the 
raiders home to oakland is important

followed john eisenhower and other dignitaries through wind and rain 
for a series of ceremonies marking the 46th anniversary of the 
normandy invasion

eisenhower the supreme commander of allied forces during world war 
ii because 1990 is the centennial of his birth 
many of those at the ceremonies wore i like ike buttons on 
their jackets 
the eisenhower entourage began the day in the medieval town of 
bayeux which miraculously escaped major damage during the battle of 
normandy then flew by helicopter to the us cemetery on a bluff 
overlooking omaha beach site of the heaviest fighting with nazi 
german forces on dday

john r galvin whose job was first held by eisenhower 
galvin said eisenhower faced difficult decisions at norfolk house 
the last being the decision to strike during a short break in the 
weather on june 6 1944 
ike is remembered after that for the great smile for the great 
symbol of confidence that he was said galvin 
but this was before the smile really became famous as the 
statue here in grosvenor square shows there was a grim 
determination involved too for me these days here at norfolk 
house were the hardest days of all

census workers are getting a raise some of 
them at least 
pay rates will increase between 50 cents and 2 an hour in 
selected locations across the country where the bureau has had 
problems attracting staff 
currently workers are paid between 5 and 8 an hour depending on 
local wage rates and staff needs 
while the bureau has sufficient job applicants nationally 
shortages exist in localities where few people are out of work and 
available for such temporary employment 
in those areas the higher pay is aimed both at recruiting more 
employees and keeping those already on the job officials said 
the doortodoor census count is scheduled to continue at least 
through june 30 and some local followup and processing will 
continue through the end of summer 
among the areas where the higher pay rates will be offered are 
the new york boston atlanta the washington dc suburbs kansas 
city charlotte nc arizona san diego los angeles and san 
francisco 
the census mandated every 10 years by the constitution is used 
to redistribute seats in the house of representatives and to divide 
up billions of dollars in federal aid among the state and 
communities

been good to me he said im someone who came from humble 
circumstances and i cannot say i live in humble circumstances now 
that is what promise did for me this belief this hard work this 
effort i dont want to see that snuffed out for a lot of other

ill campaign hard for him harvey gantt 
helms issued congratulations on a hardearned victory and 
said in a statement i congratulate mike easley on a hardfought 
race 
thad beyle a political science professor at the university of 
north carolina said it was crucial for gantt to keep control of the 
agenda in his race against the threeterm incumbent 
he has to deflect divert and deeverything else the tradition 
of helms setting the agenda and then making people measure up to 
that agenda beyle said 
helms already has amassed more than 53 million for the senate 
campaign beyle said gantt could face a more difficult time than 
former gov jim hunt who was defeated by helms in 1984 in raising 
money 
but hell get a lot of the abh anybody but helms money out 
there beyle said 
gannt said he wants to campaign on problems that affect working 
people health care public education and the environment he said

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter should be imprisoned for feeding congress a diet of 
lies about the irancontra affair prosecutors said today 
poindexter did violence to this nations fundamental principles 
of government by trying to cover up details of usiran arms 
sales and covert aid to the nicaraguan rebels the prosecutors said 
in a sentencing memo made public today 
that system relies fundamentally upon the exchange of truthful 
information the memo said if as occurred in this case 
highranking officials of one branch of government feel free to feed 
the other branch a diet of lies then the constitutional system will 
surely sicken and eventually die said the memo by independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh 
poindexter who served as president reagans national security 
adviser from late 1985 until his resignation when the irancontra 
affair was exposed in november 1986 is scheduled to be sentenced 
monday for lying to congress and destroying documents 
he could receive up to 25 years imprisonment and fined as much as 
125 million for five felony convictions of conspiracy making 
false statements and obstruction 
walshs office said poindexter should be given a period of 
incarceration because his crimes severely threaten the integrity 
of our system of government and to warn other highranking 
public officials that criminal violations of the public trust will 
result in more than mere loss of public employment 
the sentencing memo was made public as one of poindexters former 
aides retired marine lt col oliver l north continued testifying 
before a newly empaneled federal grand jury that is continuing to 
investigate the irancontra affair 
it is trying o determine if other reagan administration officials 
participated in efforts to conceal from congress the covert arms 
supply network north operated to assist the nicaraguan contras when 
us military aid was cut off 
north a former national security council staff aide is 
appealing his conviction on related irancontra crimes north was 
placed on probation and ordered to perform community service 
in its sentencing memo the prosecution urged us district judge 
harold h greene to disregard arguments that poindexter deserves 
leniency because neither north nor former national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane were given prison terms for their irancontra 
convictions 
there can be no serious argument that the defendant is 
entitled to leniency because he was a mere subordinate the 
prosecution said in contrasting poindexter with north poindexter 
occupied a position where his judgment was critical and in many 
instances if former president reagans deposition testimony is any 
guide final it said 
unlike mcfarlane who pleaded guilty to four misdemeanor charges 
of withholding information from congress poindexter did not 
cooperate with prosecutors or accept his guilt

more violence broke out today in a republic of 
soviet central asia where a land dispute between ethnic groups has 
left 40 people dead and more than 200 injured in the past three 
days an official said 
anatoly lukyanov chairman of the supreme soviet legislature 
gave the figures in a report to lawmakers on the latest outbreak of 
ethnic fighting to confront the government of president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
lukyanov did not give a breakdown of the deaths by ethnic groups 
in the republic of kirghizia where fighting began monday between 
kirghiz and uzbeks the tass news agency has said only 32 people 
have died in the clashes and 200 were injured no breakdown was 
given in its report either 
police fired on members of both ethnic groups who tried to storm 
police stations in the city of osh in the densely populated western 
part of the republic near its border with uzbekistan the tass news 
agency said today 
the difficult process of regulating the conflict is going on 
lukyanov told lawmakers he asked deputies from the two republics to 
appeal for calm 
the violence continued for a third day today and the casualties 
included 21 members of law enforcement agencies lukyanov said he 
did not give any further details or say how many of the 21 had been 
killed and how many injured 
he said osh itself was calm but that the violence had moved to 
three other nearby areas outside the city 
ethnic uzbeks from the fergana valley of uzbekistan arrived in 
the area to help their comrades fight lukyanov said adding the 
soviet defense ministry dispatched reinforcements from the republic 
of turkmenia to the osh area 
the clashes spread to the nearby town of uzgen where six of the 
deaths and 18 injuries were reported police in frunze the capital 
of kirghizia were placed on alert 
a duty officer of the osh police said most shops and factories 
reopened today after being shut down on tuesday the officer who 
spoke in a telephone intervew refused to give his name 
tass reported that helicopters hovered over osh and armored 
personnel carriers rolled through the streets in the city of 210000 
people 
armed kirghiz and uzbeks tried to attack regional civil defense 
headquarters and police stations in three districts of the city on 
tuesday forcing police to open fire interfax said 
a state of emergency and a 10 pm6 am curfew remained in 
effect after the rioting began late monday in a dispute between the 
two sunni moslem ethnic groups over plots of land for housing 
hundreds rampaged through the streets of osh setting fire to at 
least 10 houses as well as several shops and cars 
tass reported that police and interior ministry troops set up 
roadblocks and restricted entry to the city the soviet army 
newspaper red star reported the only enterprise that had opened 
tuesday in osh was a large bakery 
in uzgen 35 miles from osh the deaths and injuries occurred 
when the district police headquarters was attacked the newspaper 
said two submachine guns were confiscated 
ethnic tensions spread to frunze where police were put on alert 
and a soccer match by a visiting team from uzbekistan was canceled 
for fear of violence according to the newspaper komsomolskaya 
pravda 
lukyanov said youths studying in frunze had tried to rally in the 
streets of the capital but had been persuaded to give up the idea 
he did not specify their nationality or their goal 
absamat masaliyev head of kirghizias parliament said in an 
address broadcast late tuesday that authorities were trying to 
resolve the land dispute tass said 
housing is critically short in soviet central asia among the 
poorest regions of the nation 
lukyanov said the violence was triggered by a dispute over the 
ownership of 79 acres of uncultivated land 
but baktiyor hamidov head of the economic department of 
uzbekistans mission in moscow said in an interview that there is 
much more land at issue he said 618000 acres of cotton fields near 
the border is being made available by the uzbek government and local 
kirghiz authorities are controlling it 
they began dividing it between the families of mostly kirghiz 
descent he said and the uzbeks demanded it be divided evenly 
hamidov said the region was among the nations most densely 
populated with 500 to 1125 people per square mile he said 
disputes over land date back to 1924 when traditional boundaries 
were blurred by stalin 
leaders of uzbek groups also demanded that an autonomous region 
be set up inside kirghizia but negotiations on this subject 
produced no results tass reported without elaboration about 
onethird of oshs residents are uzbek

a hydrogen leak that postponed 
columbias astronomy mission reappeared during a test today and 
nasa officials were analyzing the data to pinpoint the source of the 
escaping fuel 
officials hoped to know by late thursday how to repair the leak 
and reschedule columbias mission said george diller spokesman for 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
it seems to be a given now that any time we go into filling the 
tank with hydrogen that the leak will reappear when we reach a 
certain temperature which is approximately minus 420 degrees 
said diller 
the theory was that the leak would only manifest itself in the 
supercold conditions of liquid hydrogen and that has been the 
case he said 
about onesixth of columbias external tank was filled with 
liquid hydrogen traces of the fuel were detected in the aft engine 
compartment 
the leak appears to be in or near a tight cavity between two 
metal plates that connect the orbiter and external tank diller 
said twentyone sensors were placed around the suspected area a 
17inchdiameter valve in a pipe that runs through both plates 
the external tank was drained following the 2hour test 
this test should really point us to it said bascom murrah a 
nasa official in charge of columbias prelaunch operations if we 
dont find it were going to be one unhappy puppy 
nasa officials fear columbia will have to be returned to the 
hangar for repairs which would delay its trip into orbit with the 
150 million astro observatory by about a month 
a launch attempt last week was scrubbed because of a hydrogen 
leak in the engine compartment during fueling with liquid hydrogen 
and liquid oxygen the mission already was two weeks late because of 
cooling system repairs 
workers were cleared from the launch pad during todays hazardous 
test hydrogen is highly combustible

prosecutors in the drug and perjury trial of 
mayor marion barry say barry has tried to infect the jury by 
accusing the government of leaking a videotape that allegedly shows 
him smoking crack cocaine 
as jury selection continued slowly and us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson complained of falling way way behind schedule 
assistant us attorney richard roberts complained that barry was 
generating negative publicity and turning sentiment toward him 
before his trial began 
the selection process resumed today with the questioning of three 
prospective jurors jackson ordered prosecutors and defense 
attorneys to limit their questioning to five minutes for each 
prospective juror in an attempt to speed up the process 
on monday barry said in a local radio interview that the 
government leaked to a television station a copy of the fbi tape 
that allegedly shows him smoking crack at a washington hotel on the 
night of his arrest last jan 18 
roberts suggested to jackson in court tuesday that barry had 
engaged in an attempt to infect the jury pool with his broadcast 
remarks he said the mayors statements were inaccurate and that in 
generating negative editorial publicity he makes these 
comments at his own peril 
us attorney jay b stephens told reporters later that the 
governments copy of the tape was locked up securely i can assure 
you of that 
by the end of the day only 12 of a pool of 250 potential jurors 
had been questioned 
among the nine of that group tentatively selected as jurors were 
a 70yearold woman who says she believes politicians are dishonest 
an fbi clerk two washington lawyers a district of columbia 
government worker a journalist and two retirees 
also in the group was a private school art teacher who initially 
said it would be an effort to overcome her feeling that barry 
was guilty of at least some of the charges against him 
barry who has pleaded innocent to the 14 charges against him 
says the governments case was the result of overreaching by federal 
prosecutors 
defense lawyer r kenneth mundy tried to exclude the art teacher 
and the elderly woman from the jury pool but jackson said the nine 
appear sufficiently impartial and rejected the request 
the elderly woman asserted she would judge barry as an 
individual not as a politician the art teacher promised she would 
heed the judges instructions to presume barrys innocence despite 
her personal feelings based on news accounts 
roberts and mundy asked several potential jurors for their views 
of fbi sting operations and electronic surveillance both techniques 
were used in the barry case in which authorities burst into the 
hotel room after allegedly watching the mayor smoke crack 
a jury of 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected from a 
pool that probably will number 35 to 45 washington residents 
barrys lawyers said they may call his campaign manager and an 
indicted former city official as defense witnesses at the mayors 
drug and perjury trial 
mundy said in court that he wanted anita bonds the campaign 
manager added to the list of possible witnesses bonds sat next to 
barry at the defense table during much of the days proceedings 
also added to the list was david rivers the former director of 
the citys department of human services and a close friend of barry 
rivers is on trial in the same courthouse accused of illegally 
steering city contracts to friends and business associates 
barry is charged with 10 counts of cocaine possession three 
counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of conspiracy the 
three perjury counts are felonies the others misdemeanors

east german retailers restaurant owners and 
other businessmen today called on their workers to strike next week 
because many will lose their jobs when the german states merge their 
economies next month 
three associations representing thousands of small and 
mediumsized businesses said perhaps half east germanys enterprises 
would be unable to compete under the terms of the economic treaty 
between the germanys 
klaus noack head of the association for independent businesses 
said 350000 workers would lose their jobs this summer and 3 million 
more jobs would be threatened some analysts have put the figure 
even higher 
noack leaders from the chamber of commerce and other business 
groups will call a strike on east germanys baltic sea island of 
reugen tuesday and a nationwide strike the following week unless 
parliament acts on their demands 
we feel that all along we have been abandoned dieter froese 
head of the association for independent businesses said in an 
interview wednesday with the east berlin newspaper berliner zeitung 
the east german newspaper berliner zeitung had reported the city 
strike would be on friday and the nationwide strike on saturday 
however officials later said at a news conference the strikes would 
not be called this week 
the german states are to merge their economies on july 2 when 
east germany will officially become a free market businesses once 
controlled by the former communist government will be free to 
compete but many sell products that are increasingly shunned by 
east germans 
the call to strike came despite the governments announcement a 
day earlier that it will spend 125 billion to retrain workers and 
pay them compensatory wages for lost or reduced salaries 
under the governments program announced tuesday east german 
industries will reduce wages and hours of many workers rather than 
lay them off said labor and social minister regine hildebrandt 
workers will receive compensation payments for time spent 
receiving retraining their reduced wages and the supplemental 
payments combined will likely be lower than their wages but higher 
than jobless benefits said mrs hildebrandt 
government figures released tuesday showed joblessness tripled 
last monthat the end of june 100000 people were officially 
unemployed about 1 percent of the work force but nearly three 
times the 35000 recorded in midapril mrs hildebrandt said 
even though a 1 percent jobless rate is minuscule by western 
standards the speed with which it materialized is alarming in a 
nation where joblessness was once officially nonexistent she said 
she predicted high unemployment in the coming months 
we must build a dam against unemployment said west german 
labor minister norbert bluem in an interview published today in the 
west german newspaper bild 
east germany is to officially shed four decades of socialism on 
july 2 when it merges its economy and social institutions with west 
germany the biggest and most difficult stage of full german 
unification 
officials in both german states are counting on a flood of 
western investment to create new employment 
but many east germans are not waiting to find out west germany 
said tuesday that east germans are still fleeing to west germany at 
a rate of 2000 a week and that more than 180000 have done so this 
year alone 
hundreds of thousands fled last year an exodus that opened the 
berlin wall and helped bring down the former socialist regime in 
october 
western firms already have begun taking over parts of the east 
german economy western food imports for example fill east german 
grocery stores and many east germans have been buying western 
clothing and electronics 
the effect has been to speed the decline of many east german 
industries

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
june 4 
the dallas morning news on honorariums 
apparently the political liabilities connected with accepting 
speaking fees have become too great for 34 senators a spot check by 
congressional quarterly magazine has found that the lawmakers are 
either declining all honorariums from outside groups or directing 
the money to charity that number is 15 more than last year 
for many voters the practice among lawmakers of accepting 
speaking fees from the same special interests that seek to influence 
them has become a striking symbol of what is wrong with congress 
last year house members in exchange for a pay raise voted to ban 
honorariums beginning in 1991 but the senate refused to follow suit 
instead the senators adopted a wimpish plan to abolish speaking 
fees gradually reducing the amount they can keep each year by the 
amount they receive in costofliving salary increases judging by 
the congressional quarterly survey however a fair number have 
taken it upon themselves to end the payoffs immediately 
good for them 
ideally the senate will come to its senses soon and ban 
honorariums altogether with or without a pay raise until then one 
can only hope that these examples of selfdenial catch on

the newsreview roseburg ore on navy sexual harassment 
adm carlisle trost chief of naval operations is to be 
commended for his tough stand against sexual harassment thats 
something the navy just wont tolerate he says unfortunately 
trosts assurance comes too late to help gwen marie dreyer 
dreyer a 19yearold midshipman at the us naval academy 
resigned in protest because she felt the navy dealt too leniently 
with male colleagues who abused assaulted and harassed her 
she was dragged from her dormitory room in annapolis md by two 
male midshipmen and handcuffed to a urinal in a mens rest room 
while others jeered and took photographs 
incredibly academy superintendent rear adm virgil hill 
concluded after an investigation that the incident was not 
premeditated and therefore did not constitute sexual harassment the 
view of the academy was that it was a student prank nothing more 
than spontaneous high jinks 
the punishment was commensurably light 
there is good reason to believe that this incident was far 
removed from an innocent spontaneous prank the very fact that 
dreyer was taken to a mens rest room takes this episode beyond 
hazing to sexual harassment 
the navy has the responsibility to review the dreyer case not 
the least because it appears to condone intolerable behavior 
the leaders of tomorrows navy should be persons of sensitivity and 
understanding not boors who revel in the humiliation of others

marinette wis eaglestar on the iowa explosion investigation 
thumbs down to the us navy for blowing a smokescreen in front 
of the death of a sailor aboard the uss iowa last year new 
evidence casts serious doubts upon the navys theory that the 
explosion in one of the ships gun turrets was caused by a suicidal 
sailor it now appears the explosion that killed 47 was an accident 
this case is one of several in recent memory where the navy has 
tried to pass the buck for the death of one of its own 
it seems naive for the navy to think they could get away with 
these coverups their actions are causing pain suffering and 
embarrassment to the families involved and erode the framework on an 
institution that is supposed to stand for honor

the phoenix gazette on criminal restitution 
to the average person it is unfortunate when a whitecollar 
criminal avoids prison but it is at least understandable when the 
price for that avoidance is to pay restitution to the persons 
victimized thus a swindler could pay back the millions of dollars 
he stole and get a light sentence or no prison time at all 
well the us supreme court has just thrown a little monkey 
wrench into the equation the court by a 72 vote decided that 
criminals may avoid paying restitution if they file bankruptcy 
since the bankruptcy law makes no mention of an exception for 
courtordered restitution 
the court probably reads the law correctly but the law is wrong 
congress should fix this loophole before the courts are faced with 
dozens of whitecollar criminals from the sampl collapse all 
accepting restitution with their fingers crossed behind them

the bakersfield calif californian on kohl and a unified 
germany 
a funny thing happened on helmut kohls way to the presidency of 
a united germany since the berlin wall began to figuratively 
crumble public opinion polls have shown that the west german 
chancellor was the preference of east and west germans to lead a 
unified germany 
sensing a delay in a vote might prevent him from heading a single 
germany kohl now wants the unity election in december six months 
sooner than he planned 
the politically savvy kohl is not waiting to get a firm figure on 
unification costs he wants the prestige of being the first unified 
german leader since world war ii delay he knows could be deadly 
for him 
besides the threat of defecting west german voters kohl has to 
consider the east german voters his backing could erode if 
expected massive unemployment sends east germans rushing to the arms 
of the social democrats who traditionally appeal to disadvantaged 
workers 
the west german chancellor will try everything he can to get 
elected president of a unified germany in 1990 he knows that come 
1991 he may no longer be the favorite

the albuquerque nm tribune on china 
when the late chou enlai chinese communist elder statesman was 
asked to assess the impact of the french revolution of 1789 he is 
said to have answered too soon to tell no doubt he would scorn 
attempts to capture the meaning of tiananmen square after just one 
year 
yet it is fair to speculate we are convinced for example that 
the brutal suppression of peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators by 
chinas communist government a year ago helped prevent a similar 
use of force in eastern europe 
the tiananmen square massacre occurred at a key moment in the 
unfolding ferment of european communism 
we dont know exactly why moscow decided to let eastern europe 
go generational change in the leadership is surely fundamental but 
we suspect it helped that the images of tiananmen square were fresh 
in soviet leaders minds when they had to choose between holding 
eastern europe by force and watching it break free

the providence ri journal bulletin on boris yeltsin 
there may now be in effect two leaders of the soviet union 
mikhail gorbachev and boris yeltsin 
in winning the presidency of russia the ussrs largest republic 
yeltsin has established himself as a formidable rival to the 
floundering soviet president and his victory has cast into further 
doubt the future unity of the soviet empire 
it should be emphasized that nobody exactly knows what sort of an 
animal yeltsin is his views on many policies are contradictory 
and confused 
equally important to remember is that yeltsin has actually 
been elected by the people through landslide victories in 
legislative races gorbachev on the other hand has never had 
to undergo an open contested election 
perhaps gorbachev will take the yeltsin election as a sign 
that hes running out of time and so needs to step up the pace of 
reform

the saginaw mich news on the summit 
the events of the next several years will provide a measuring 
stick for president bushs laidback approach to the ussoviet 
summit 
bush was dealing from a position of strength in his talks with 
the beleaguered mikhail gorbachev but he didnt play his trump 
cards 
gorbachev came away with two big prizes he received a political 
prop through the telecasts of the ceremonial pomp back home and in 
the process bush gave him a trade agreement to sate a population 
that desires not only political freedom but western products 
for bush however the pot was virtually empty he did not press 
hard for an end to the soviet economic embargo of lithuania even 
though gorbachev was desperate for the trade pact the weapons 
accord is rooted in the fluff of general longrange goals with the 
tough detail work to come later 
but if the united states props up gorbachev and helps him 
survive and if the soviet leader grows stronger in his push for 
reforms then historians will laud bush for a display of wisdom 
indeed it is in americas best interest to assist gorbachev who 
for the most part has reduced hostilities and oppression it isnt a 
question of trusting him the proof rests in his actions and 
most have been positive

november election for governor 
on a primary day that bucked tradition californians also voted 
tuesday to double their gasoline taxes oust an incumbent mayor and 
spend billions of dollars on transportation improvements 
feinsteins victory over attorney general john van de kamp took 
her as close as any woman has ever stood to winning the california 
governorship a feat all the more remarkable for a politician from 
northern california not the more populous south 
well we did it feinstein told supporters at her san 
francisco campaign headquarters one mission completed one more 
to go i think we have shown tonight that we are one state not 
northerners versus southerners we are one state and proud of it 
van de kamp conceding defeat in los angeles said the former san 
francisco mayor had hammered out an extraordinary victory 
running a campaign that overwhelmed his own 
i feel a little tonight like the auto mechanic who was run over 
by a corvette who says i think my leg is broken but did you see 
that car he told supporters 
wilson who cruised to victory against token opposition 
congratulated feinstein even before van de kamp conceded defeated 
but he issued a warning to the democratic nominee 
my friends in the democratic party whoop it up tonight because 
this is your last victory party of the 1990s wilson said in his 
victory speech 
feinsteins victory came months after her campaign was all but 
written off by most political leaders but a savvy advertising 
campaign and an infusion of money much of it her own helped 
rescue her candidacy and put it on the road to victory 
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting early today feinstein 
had 1288749 votes to van de kamps 1007251 a 52to41 percent 
margin nine lesserknown democrats split the remaining 7 percent 
wilson californias junior us senator swamped three 
lesserknown gop rivals to capture 89 percent of the vote 
proposition 111 the measure to raise the state gasoline tax from 
9 cents to 18 cents per gallon won by a 53to47 percent margin a 
companion 1 billion rail bond measure won by 56 percent to 44 
percent while a rival 199 billion rail bond measure won by a 53 
percent to 47 percent 
voters rejected two ballot measures that would have stripped the 
democratic legislature of much of its power to set the boundaries of 
california legislative districts 
several races featured new political faces with familiar family 
names 
incumbent tom hayes defeated angela bay buchanan former us 
treasurer and sister of conservative commentator pat buchanan by a 
32 margin for the republican nomination for state treasurer 
kathleen brown daughter of former gov pat brown and sister of 
former gov jerry brown won the democratic nomination for treasurer 
by a similar margin

her quest to serve a fifth term as the states chief election 
officer while her son matt fong was unopposed in his bid for the 
republican nomination for state controller

lure the los angeles raiders football team back to his city lost in 
his bid for a fifth term two rivals state assemblyman elihu harris

il tempo rome on the summit 
george bush wished his guest good luck as michael gorbachev 
boarded his limousine it was the last oneliner of the sovietus 
summit the one that summarizes it best 
gorbachev will need a lot of luck to stay where he is and to win 
the many challenges lying in wait as he returns to moscow 
speculation no gorbachev himself spoke to the matter in the 
closing press conference the difficulties and delays of 
perestroika the rebellion of boris yeltsin recently installed 
president of the russian republic the obstinance of secessionist 
lithuania the fury of a population faced with empty stores and the 
loss of authority 
gorbachev left washington in approximately the same state of mind 
as richard nixon when he left moscow 16 years ago he took back 
home the feeling of having gained additional time hounded by 
watergate nixon lasted a few months how many will there be for

times of india new delhi on soviet economic reforms 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs decision to submit his 
proposals for revamping the economy to a public referendum will be 
seen by many to be a desperate gamble the soviet economy is in a 
shambles 
this has pushed most of his economic advisers into ever greater 
pessimism about the possibility of effectively reforming the 
socialist economy as distinct from simply abandoning it altogether 
in favor of a fullfledged market system 
gorbachevs effort to seek public endorsement via a referendum 
and his hyperbole about the economic reform he is promoting being as 
profound a matter as the consequences of the october revolution 
itself shows how fragile his own situation is 
it is almost certain that his new economic package will not do 
the trick all efforts at decentralizing the socialist economy 
have ultimately failed 
but if gorbachev goes in for polishstyle shock therapy 
he will almost certainly provoke mass upsurges from an industrial 
work force which in numerical terms is the largest in the world

daily telegraph london on china 
a year after the beijing massacre china is subdued the old men 
who ordered the crushing of the prodemocracy movement have little 
to fear in the immediate future 
the drying up of foreign credit has hurt the economy which in 
turn makes the partys hold on power less secure politically 
western disapproval has marginalized china in stark contrast to the 
period during which it was wooed as a standardbearer of communist 
reform 
as the anniversary of the massacre passes western governments 
may well decide to relax their sanctions in particular to reopen 
lines of credit to beijing 
as a response to real need this would be acceptable provided 
the donors reiterate their condemnations of chinas human rights 
record whether in conducting vendettas at home harassing exiled 
dissidents interfering in hong kongs internal affairs or brutally 
crushing unrest in tibet dealing with fading ideologues in beijing 
may be a necessity but there is no reason for the west to go out of 
its way to be friendly

the family of a sailor who drowned during 
a rescue drill is challenging the legal doctrine that bans lawsuits 
against the military for deaths or injuries incident to service 
the us supreme court laid down what is called the feres 
doctrine in 1950 when it refused to let survivors of rudolf j 
feres a soldier killed in a barracks fire sue the government under 
the federal tort claims act 
in action filed monday a lawyer for the family of airman recruit 
lee mirecki urged us district judge winston arnow to overrule the 
feres doctrine claiming it is contrary to the intent of congress as 
well as unfair and irrational 
failing that wrote martin levin arnow should rule the doctrine 
doesnt apply to the mirecki case either because his death at the 
navy rescue swimmer school was not incident to service or because he 
had withdrawn from the navy which he was allowed by contract to do 
by repeatedly shouting i quit as instructors forced him back 
into a training pool 
when the military personnel know or should know that they are 
violating the clear constitutional rights of a serviceman the court 
should rule that the acts are so egregious that it cannot be 
said that the injury resulted incident to service levin wrote 
mirecki 19 of appleton wis died march 2 1988 at the 
pensacola naval air station of drowning and heart failure induced by 
fear a navy pathologist testified during a subsequent court martial 
one instructor was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced 
to 90 days in the brig a second trial cleared the officer in charge 
of the school of dereliction of duty four other instructors 
received administrative penalties the commander of the naval 
aviation schools command was reprimanded 
mireckis mother elaine m kitowski and the sailors estate are 
seeking 75 million 
the government has asked that the lawsuit be dismissed because of 
the feres doctrine arnow will rule on that motion after the 
government responds to levins argument 
mirecki had signed a statement permitting him to drop on 
request from rescue swimmer school

south korean president roh taewoo said today 
that he and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev have agreed to 
undertake a joint effort to melt down the ice that still exists 
from the cold war 
speaking to reporters after conferring with president bush roh 
also said a peace settlement on the korean peninsula could lead to 
further reductions or reallocations of american forces in south 
korea 
roh met with bush two days after his groundbreaking meeting with 
gorbachev in san francisco the first such encounter since korea was 
divided after world war ii 
roh said he and gorbachev agreed to cooperate so that we can 
melt down the ice that still exists from the cold war years 
asked about prospects for reunification with north korea roh 
said that country must first open up and embark on a reform process 
he said gorbachev agreed to combine efforts along that line 
he said the meeting will help reduce tensions on the peninsula 
and expressed hope it will help greatly the process of 
reunification 
earlier as the two leaders posed for photographers in the oval 
office bush described as very important the san francisco 
meeting 
roh said he was pleased that the meeting with gorbachev took 
place in the united states 
bush received roh after the south korean had breakfast with vice 
president dan quayle 
there was a sense of optimism as roh flew here tuesday from san 
francisco to brief bush on his meeting 
this historic meeting has improved prospects for peace on the 
korean peninsula and eventual korean unification state department 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
roh predicted the meeting eventually will lead to full diplomatic 
relations with moscow 
the administration is hopeful that absent the unswerving support 
of soviet union communist north korea will be more likely to seek 
friendlier ties with south korea and the industrialized west 
in his remarks monday roh noted that the gorbachev era in moscow 
has brought a generalized easing of eastwest tensions except in 
korea 
the korean peninsula remains the last area of tension in the 
cold war he said the cold war on the korean peninsula now 
begins to crack 
on tuesday roh called the meeting the greatest diplomatic 
event in south korean history and said efforts would be made to 
establish ties with another longtime rival china 
us officials expressed delight with the prospective 
accommodation between seoul and moscow recalling that it was less 
than seven years ago that a soviet missile shot down a korea 
commercial jetliner killing all 269 people aboard in the 
aftermath sovietamerican relations hit a low point 
the bush administration attached significance to the 
rohgorbachev meeting because korea has long been viewed as one of 
the most likely areas for an eastwest showdown 
it is an area where tensions often have run high where there are 
heavy concentrations of military weapons and where both moscow and 
washington have vital interests 
the meeting with gorbachev occurred just three weeks short of the 
40th anniversary of the outbreak of the korean war a conflict in 
which the kremlin was the major arms supplier of north korea while 
the united states provided arms and troops for the south 
the weapons deliveries by the two superpowers have continued 
unabated ever since one potential benefit of an eventual 
accommodation between the two koreas would be the withdrawal of the 
40000 american troops stationed in south korea 
the meeting also came at a time of some indications by north 
korea of interest in improving relations with the united states 
just last week it returned the remains of five american servicemen 
killed during the korean war the first such gesture since 1954

cochran of mississippi was arguably the biggest winner among them 
he faces no democratic opposition in the fall and is thus assured of 
a new term 
democrats bill bradley of new jersey howell heflin of alabama 
and max baucus of montana easily overcame challenges within their 
party while democrat tom harkin of iowa and republicans larry 
pressler of south dakota and pete domenici of new mexico were 
unopposed 
incumbent governors in iowa and south dakota also were 
renominated along with hunt in alabama

and called the defeat of two republicanbacked redistricting 
referenda a blowout for us 
they are going to have a money advantage he said referring 
to wilsons 3 million warchest but he added issues are going 
to prevail 
it was the california democratic primary for governor that drew 
most of the nationwide attention both for the size of the state and 
because the next governor will play a large role in determining

hardfought primary 
with 99 percent of the precincts counted she had 52 percent of

fall campaign will be a choice between two californias one 
with a declining quality of life more crime more traffic it is

governor against gop incumbent terry branstad who opposes abortion 
avenson who favors abortion rights won 40 percent of the vote to 
defeat antiabortion democrat tom miller and three other contenders 
the national organization for women and the national abortion rights 
actionleague both of which endorsed avenson had feared he would 
split the vote with other prochoice contenders and permit miller to 
win 
in addition to picking candidates for governor californians 
voted to raise the state gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon to 
finance badly needed highway repair supporters said approval of the 
measure would mark a symbolic end to the tax revolt that began in 
1978 with passage of proposition 13 with 98 percent of precincts 
counted the proposal was gaining 52 percent of the vote 
the lines were drawn for what shape up as some of the nations 
most contested senate elections in november when republicans seek 
to cut into the current 5545 democratic advantage

alabama voters 
another landslide victor was democratic us sen howell heflin

language the measure gives state residents the right to sue if the 
amendment is violated but does not define what constitutes a 
violation

torture has been routine in nepalese police 
stations especially during the unrest that followed the birth of 
the nations prodemocracy movement in february amnesty 
international said wednesday 
many victims suffered broken limbs had pins stuck under 
fingernails toenails ripped off and canes inserted into body 
orifices it said 
beatings including on the soles of the feet were 
widespread the worldwide human rights organization said 
it said the findings were based on more than 80 interviews with 
alleged victims by an amnesty team that visited the himalayan 
kingdom in april the team included a forensic expert familiar with 
torture cases it said 
the charges were contained in a memorandum it said was being 
presented to nepals prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai in 
april a new government led by opposition figures took office as 
part of the political reforms undertaken by king birendra who 
previously held the monopoly on power 
the army was called out in april after police fired on 
prodemocracy demonstrators marching on birendras palace 
amnesty internationals statement said the number of fatalities 
was not known but that estimates ranged from fewer than 20 to more 
than 600 on april 6 alone it said its team found evidence that 
police several times ignored the rules on using live ammunition 
against demonstrations 
in a number of cases demonstrators were shot in the head 
shoulders or chest apparently in contravention of the specific 
obligation not to shoot above the knees it said police 
officers also repeatedly obstructed doctors trying to help the 
victims 
amnesty international said thousands of people were arrested 
during the disturbances and often kept in overcrowded and 
unhygienic conditions 
it said its team was told of prisoners being refused access to 
family and lawyers in some cases their detention was not recorded 
raising the danger that detained people will go missing within 
the system the statement said 
amnesty international acknowledged that the difficulty of 
maintaining proper records during mass arrests 
it also noted that since april 6 most uncharged political 
prisoners have been released and that the outgoing government 
promised compensation to relatives of the dead and injured but it 
said some prisoners remained in custody including christians jailed 
for proselytizing 
the statement called on bhattarais government to write human 
rights safeguards into nepalese law and outlaw torture 
incommunicado detention and summary executions

through the philosophical arguments surrounding the fate of seven 
frozen human embryos to reach a practical resolution 
we have to make a decision about what to do with these 
embryos said presiding judge clifford e sanders as the court of 
appeals heard arguments on a divorce decision that gave the embryos 
to the wife 
were dealing with a very narrow issue here and thats what to 
do with these embryos judge herschel p franks said interrupting 
a statement by one of the lawyers on the impact the case could have 
on birth control methods lets keep to that issue 
janet mayfield the attorney for junior davis said davis wants 
control over whether he becomes a parent she argued that he has a 
constitutional right to make that decision 
kurt erlenbach the attorney for mary sue davis stowe said his 
client wants control of the embryos so she can give them up for 
donation to some other infertile couple mrs stowe had said during 
the divorce trial last year she wanted the embryos for implantation 
in her womb in an effort to give birth 
since their divorce eight months ago davis 31 and his 
29yearold exwife both have remarried but their battle to control 
the embryos continues the embryos are in cryogenic storage at the 
knoxville in vitro fertilization clinic where they were created in

blount county judge w dale young who treated the embryos as if

during their fourday trial in august davis and mrs stowe said 
they would not consider the option of donating the embryos to some 
other childless couple 
in her response filed last week however mrs stowe said she no 
longer wants to use the embryos in an attempt to have children she 
now asks for control of the embryos so she can donate them for use 
by someone else according to erlenbachs response

prosecutors said wednesday that former national 
security adviser john m poindexter should to go prison because he 
subverted democratic principles by feeding congress a diet of 
lies about the irancontra affair 
a prison term would warn other highranking officials that 
criminal violations of the public trust will result in more than 
mere loss of public employment prosecutors in the office of 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said in a memo to us 
district judge harold h greene 
poindexter president reagans national security adviser from 
late 1985 until the irancontra affair unraveled in november 1986 
is scheduled to be sentenced monday on five felony convictions 
the retired navy rear admiral faces up to 25 years in prison and 
fines up to 125 million he was convicted april 7 of conspiracy 
making false statements and obstructing congressional inquiries into 
the sale of us arms to iran and covert aid to nicaraguan contras 
poindexters lies misleading statements and destruction of 
documents did violence to this nations fundamental principles of 
government prosecutors said it is they said a system that 
relies fundamentally upon the exchange of truthful information 
if as occurred in this case highranking officials of one 
branch of government feel free to feed the other branch a diet of 
lies then the constitutional system will surely sicken and 
eventually die prosecutors said 
the sentencing memo was filed as one of poindexters former 
subordinates retired marine lt col oliver l north resumed 
testifying before a newly empaneled grand jury continuing to 
investigate the irancontra affair 
north a former national security council aide gave seven hours 
of testimony last week he is appealing his own irancontra 
convictions 
the grand jury is trying to determine if other reagan 
administration officials participated in efforts to conceal details 
of the usiran arms sales and the diversion of profits to the 
contras 
the grand jury also is expected to try to make a final assessment 
of the exact roles of reagan and thenvice president bush in the 
affair poindexter is expected to be subpoenaed to testify 
in their sentencing memo prosecutors urged the judge to ignore 
pleas for leniency on the ground that neither north nor robert 
mcfarlane who preceded poindexter as national security adviser was 
imprisoned for irancontra convictions 
poindexter prosecutors said occupied a position where his 
judgment was critical and in many instances if former president 
reagans deposition testimony is any guide final 
prosecutors said that mcfarlane unlike poindexter accepted 
responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to four 
misdemeanor counts of withholding information from congress and 
cooperating with the investigation

the use of blood transfusions began to fall in us 
hospitals during the 1980s largely because of fear of passing on 
aids a nationwide study shows 
the study found that transfusions of whole blood and red cells 
began declining after a peak of 122 million pints in 1986 during 
the mid1980s people have sharply increased the practice of setting 
aside their own blood for use during operations 
the study directed by dr douglas m surgenor of the center for 
blood research in boston was based on a survey of about 5800 
hospitals and blood centers it was published in thursdays new 
england journal of medicine 
among the findings 
transfusions of whole blood and red cells fell to 116 million 
pints in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988 the last year of the 
survey 
transfusions of blood plasma dropped almost 9 percent during the 
decade 
donations of autologous blood the practice of setting aside 
blood for ones own use increased from 30000 pints in 1982 to 
397000 pints in 1987 
the supply of blood donated for others was unchanged between 
1986 and 1988 
the researchers attributed the changes to fear of passing on the 
aids virus through transfusions the chance of catching the disease 
from a transfusion has been slight since blood banks began screening 
for the virus in 1985

police detained former communist 
party chief milos jakes and at least four other ousted communist 
leaders the official news agency said today just two days before 
the first free elections since 1946 
those taken into custody for questioning also included vasil 
bilak a former communist party ideology chief accused of having 
invited soviet troops to czechoslovakia in 1968 
the others detained were former premier jozef lenart and former 
senior communist party leaders michal stefanak and rudolf hegenbart 
the detentions were certain to deal another blow to the 
communists credibility before the election friday and saturday for 
the federal parliament and the czech and slovak legislatures 
the official ctk news agency said bilak was detained on suspicion 
of committing serious criminal activity it gave no reason for 
the other detentions and did not say where they were being held 
bilak 72 was picked up at midnight tuesday from his home in the 
slovak capital of bratislava deputy interior minister andrej samel 
said he was detained for 48 hours an official who identified 
himself only as secansky said from the general prosecutors office 
in bratislava 
jakes stefanak and hegenbart answered summons from police this 
morning samel said he said he did not know how long the four would 
be interrogated 
jakes was communist party chief until nov 24 when he was ousted 
along with all senior figures who had enforced orthodox communist 
rule after the warsaw pact invasion of august 1968 crushed the 
prague spring reforms 
hegenbart was named last week in a british broadcasting corp 
documentary that claimed he was involved in an alleged scheme with 
the soviet kgb to oust jakes last november 
the public is going to be informed about the future course of 
the investigation the terse ctk report that focused on bilak said 
samel said the four summoned for interrogation were asked to help 
police to clarify their activities related to the 1968 invasion 
and possibly other criminal activities as well 
they could have refused the summons but willingly complied 
he said 
jakes bilak and lenart were all expelled from the party after 
the november revolution that brought president vaclav havel to power 
in this weeks election havels civic forum which helped lead 
the anticommunist revolt is expected to emerge as a strong force 
although not to win an outright majority 
in april this year czechoslovak prosecutors launched an 
investigation into the 1968 sovietled invasion the investigation 
was to clarify what prosecutors have termed all circumstances of 
this criminal offense against peace 
that offense carries a maximum sentence of 15 years in jail 
lubomir veleta deputy general prosecutor said april 7 the main 
aim of the investigation was to identify people responsible for 
inviting the soviet troops into czechoslovakia 
bilak has long been accused to be the official who requested that 
soviet troops intervene but he has denied the charges 
the czechoslovak government has officially requested that soviet 
authorities release all documents related to the invasion but the 
kremlin has refused 
the invasion of soviet troops into czechoslovakia in 1968 was 
not decided on the basis of this or that appeal of individuals if 
there ever was such a thing soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
vadim perfiliev was quoted in a czechoslovak paper on may 29 as 
saying 
after the 1968 invasion bilak rose under the leadership of 
fellow slovak gustav husak to be chief communist party ideologue

allied veterans armed with video 
recorders returned to one of world war iis greatest battlefields 
wednesday to commemorate the man who sent them ashore to defeat nazi 
germany dwight d eisenhower 
winddriven rain lashed the normandy beaches as veterans and 
dignitaries from a dozen countries paid tribute to eisenhower on the 
100th year of his birth and the 46th anniversary of dday 
i dont think theres any doubt that giving the order for this 
operation was the most difficult decision my father ever made 
said john eisenhower the generals son but he never looked 
back 
us army navy and air force brass and veterans of all ranks 
appeared in solemn wreathlaying ceremonies at the american national 
cemetery on a bluff overlooking omaha beach 
the annual dday commemoration took on a special meaning this 
year as the defense department saluted the man who ordered the 
biggest seaborne invasion in history 
some 200000 predominantly american british and canadian 
soldiers stormed onto the normandy coast in landings coordinated 
with paratroop drops starting a campaign that less than a year 
later toppled adolf hitlers nazi regime one million men eventually 
landed on five normandy beaches 
gen john galvin commander of nato forces in europe said 
eisenhowers dream of a peaceful europe begun with the liberation 
of western europe and the creation of nato was near realization 
due to the democratic changes sweeping eastern europe and various 
ussoviet arms control agreements 
as we look ahead now to a protracted peace and the great 
opportunities that present themselves said galvin i hope we 
can honor the fighters who lay in this field who died on the 
beaches of france 
the immaculately manicured lawns hold the graves of 9386 us 
servicemen the field overlooks the sandy dunes where many of them 
died in the bloodiest fighting of the dday landings 
one omaha beach veteran who came to remember was jack boardman 
66 of chicago 
in the early hours of june 6 1944 a transport ship dropped his 
amphibious tank 10000 yards out to sea the first tank in his 
batallion of 30 sank in the choppy english channel 
we went up the beach with the infantrymen said boardman 
wearing an indiana jonesstyle hat and a regimental patch on his 
bush jacket the tank commander hit me on the back and said 
shoot shoot 
i didnt know what to shoot at finally i saw a dark 
rectangle it was one of the pillboxes cement fortication housing 
artillery or machineguns so i just started shooting 
later in the day his tank lost both treads his crew climbed out 
and waded through bodies of dead us soldiers three deep mown down 
by german mortar artillary and machinegun fire 
boardman is now close friends with one of those germans heinrich 
severloh of metzingen west germany severloh 67 remembers 
terror when dawn broke and he saw an allied fleet of 7000 
warships heading straight at him 
shells were dropping everywhere he recalled thank god 
they were dropping behind us i was a machine gunner we waited for 
the americans to come ashore when they were kneedeep my officer 
gave the order to fire 
severlohs unit fell back that evening with no radio ammunition 
or commanding officer a veteran of the russian front severloh was 
captured the next day 
there are no enemies anymore he said putting an arm around 
boardmans shoulders 
a flight of f14 fighters from the navy aircraft carrier uss 
eisenhower roared overhead as the 2000 spectators looked on 
wreaths were placed later at the pointe du hoc a formidable german 
artillary position lying between omaha beach and the other american 
landing sight utah beach to the north 
a commando force of 270 us rangers scaled the razorlike cliffs 
of the pointe just before the landings to knock out what commanders 
feared could be a devastating firing point against the vulnerable 
soldiers wading up both beaches a day later only 90 of the rangers 
were able to carry a weapon 
john eisenhower dedicated a monument to his father in an 
overgrown farmers field between utah beach and st lo where gen 
eisenhower set up his first field headquarters on the continent and 
where he first met gen charles de gaulle in france 
this was the fourth stop on the journey to victory 
commemoration organized by the us department of defense in honor 
of the 100th anniversary of eisenhowers birth the events 
culminating at the arc de triomph in paris friday were timed to 
coincide with the 46th anniversary of the invasion rather than 
eisenhowers birthday on oct 14 
previous ceremonies were held in britain and on the english 
channel aboard the carrier eisenhower

astrophysicistturneddissident fang lizhi longs 
to see the sky but writes that he and his wife are in good spirits 
and pursuing scientific research inside the us embassy in beijing 
their son said 
one year ago tuesday the two were forced to take refuge in the 
us embassy in beijing by a brutal and bloody situation and 
increasing violation of their freedoms and human rights said 
their son fang ke a physics student at wayne state university in 
detroit he communicates with his parents by letters 
little about fang and his wife li shuxian is known since they 
entered the embassy because they have declined to talk with 
reporters the embassy has refused to answer nearly all questions 
about them 
their son spoke tuesday night to a group gathered to mark the 
publication of children of the dragon the story of tiananmen 
square the book was compiled by the new yorkbased group human 
rights in china about last years prodemocracy movement that ended 
in violent military suppression june 34 
fang lizhi and his wife also a physicist became well known for 
their advocacy of democracy and human rights in china before last 
years demonstrations 
the couple took refuge after being accused of inciting the 
studentlead protests the government has said they are 
counterrevolutionaries 
letters from his parents reveal both frustration and hope fang 
said 
once my father said i am an astronomer and i cannot see the 
sky he said 
but both have continued their research with help from overseas 
colleagues and they have written 10 literary and scientific 
articles that will be published in western magazines he said 
their spirits are strong fang said in an interview in one 
letter he said his father wrote we will create a new life no 
matter how unbearable the condition is 
their son said free speech is among the freedoms enshrined in the 
chinese constitution 
a few people like my father dare to exercise and enjoy this 
kind of freedom and rights and so are accused of being criminals 
actually they were accused because of their conscience and 
beliefs he said 
some chinese are displeased with fang and li for seeking refuge 
in the embassy and with student leaders who fled overseas they 
feel they have betrayed the chinese people by not enduring through 
the period that followed the demonstrations in tiananmen square 
fang said his parents who have another son in china were 
reluctant to go to the embassy because they did not want to hurt the 
prodemocracy movement but they realized their lives may have been 
at stake 
fang said he speaks for himself not as an official spokesman for 
his parents 
i have the confidence as well as my father and my mother that 
we will win eventually he said

the soviet union has retracted what 
appeared to be a threat by president mikhail s gorbachev to suspend 
jewish emigration to israel a senior us official said today 
us secretary of state james a baker iii told soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze at a meeting tuesday in copenhagen 
denmark he was concerned about gorbachevs statement at the 
washington summit the official said 
in reply shevardnadze told baker that the soviet had no plan 
to change their approach they are committed to that said the 
official who briefed reporters on condition that he not be 
identified 
baker flew to turnberry from the danish capital where he and 
shevardnadze attended a 35nation human rights conference in 
scotland baker is to talk with nato ministers on the latest us 
and soviet moves toward an agreement on the military future of a 
reunified germany 
the senior us official also said shevardnadze advised baker the 
israeli government would be informed that emigration policy was not 
being altered 
the foreign minister did not say how moscow was informing israel 
the official said there are no formal relations between the two 
countries but diplomats have exchanged visits 
the senior official volunteered the account of the conversation 
held at the soviet embassy in copenhagen when he briefed reporters 
aboard bakers us air force jet 
gorbachev speaking sunday at a joint news conference with 
president bush at the end of the fourday washington summit said 
israel should heed the advice of the two leaders and not settle 
soviet jews on the occupied west bank or in gaza 
we are facing the following situation gorbachev said 
either after these summit meetings our concern is heeded in 
israel and they will make certain conclusions or else we must give 
further thought to it in terms of what we do in issuing permits for 
exit 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at a record high 
about 20000 permits were issued last month the united states is 
taking in about 70000 soviet jews this year most of the others go 
to israel where their rising numbers perturbs the arabs 
also today baker said he would take to the nato allies a soviet 
proposal for an agreement with the warsaw pact on the military 
future of a reunited germany 
baker said that even though shevardnadze had provided him with 
only a few details i hope we are making progress in persuading 
moscow to give up its objections to german membership in the western 
alliance 
i dont feel at liberty to get into the details baker told 
reporters at a copenhagen news conference after all he said 
this is an alliancetoalliance matter if it ever comes to 
anything 
baker said the soviets wanted confidencebuilding measures as 
part of any settlement on germany other us officials said the 
measures under discussion also involved accelerating negotiations 
for reducing nonnuclear arms in europe 
before flying to turnberry baker called in a speech for 
strengthening the rule of law in central european countries that are 
shaking off soviet influence 
the watchword of reformers everywhere is the rule of law 
baker said quoting the late soviet dissident and nobel laureate 
andrei sakharov democratic change must be accomplished through 
democratic methods peacefully through legal processes 
his speech to a 35nation human rights conference contained scant 
mention of the situation in the baltics the soviet republics of 
lithuania latvia and estonia are at various stages in their quest 
for independence and are encountering stiff resistance from moscow 
in the address baker did not confront the soviets directly but 
urged them to initiate a systematic dialogue with leaders of the 
independence movements so that the aspirations of the baltic 
peoples can be achieved 
on another topic baker offered the most optimistic us forecast 
yet about completing a treaty to sharply reduce us and soviet 
troops tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons in europe 
he said that at the csce summit we would expect to sign a cfe 
agreement and president gorbachev last week indicated he shared 
this view 
the french government the host proposed on tuesday to hold the 
summit of the 35nation conference on european security and 
cooperation in paris in december the bush administration has made 
completion of the conventional forces in europe treaty a 
precondition for the event 
describing his talks on germany with shevardnadze baker said the 
soviet government had to develop its proposal more fully before the 
western allies could respond to it formally 
still baker said enough had been made clear by shevardnadze in 
their twohour meeting at the soviet embassy on tuesday to know 
what they are talking about is an agreement between the warsaw 
pact and the nato alliance 
he said he hoped to have more details from moscow at a meeting on 
germanys future planned for june 22 in berlin the four world war 
ii allies the united states britain france and the soviet 
unikon will attend along with the foreign ministers of the two 
german states

us secretary of state james a baker 
iii on wednesday presented a soviet proposal on germanys military 
future to the 15 us allies in nato as having the potential to 
break an eastwest deadlock 
i hope we are making progress baker said before leaving 
copenhagen where he discussed the idea for two hours tuesday night 
with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
he then flew to this small town on the western coast of scotland 
where prime minister margaret thatcher had invited the nato foreign 
ministers to meet on germany and other eastwest issues 
baker will see mrs thatcher on thursday and confer with the 
foreign ministers through saturday a month from now president bush 
and the heads of the 15 governments will meet at a nato summit in 
london 
the key issue in all these sessions is the impending union of 
east germany and west germany producing a powerful nation that the 
allies and even some members of the sovietled warsaw pact want 
enrolled in nato 
the problem is persuading soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
to acquiesce the soviets are losing east germany as a staunch ally 
and buffer and will now be confronted by a country with which they 
fought two world wars this century 
bushs prescription is to anchor germany in nato as a protection 
against any unilateral move by the germans 
baker offered shevardnadze a ninepoint package of assurances 
including a german promise not to acquire nuclear or chemical 
weapons or to seek to expand its borders 
at their meeting tuesday night in copenhagen the soviet foreign 
minister went into some detail about what baker called 
confidencebuilding measures 
the soviet idea is to have nato and the warsaw pact which begins 
a meeting thursday in moscow exchange political assurances 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany who 
attended a 35nation human rights conference in copenhagen with 
baker and shevardnadze said in a speech there that the democratic 
europe must be a europe of tolerance 
he said ideological blindness nationalism racism fascism and 
antisemitism have caused inhuman terror and untold suffering on our 
continent 
the foreign minister leader of west germanys liberal free 
democratic party said we germans know that we cannot cope with 
our future without the will to remember the past 
he said germany and all other european nations must be alert to 
any hint of antisemitism and to resolutely nip any such 
developments in the bud 
baker told reporters he was not at liberty to get into the 
details of the soviet proposal after all he said this is 
an alliancetoalliance matter if it ever comes to anything 
in his speech at the human rights conference baker called for 
free elections and freemarket economies throughout eastern and 
central europe 
the watchword of reformers everywhere is the rule of law he 
said quoting the late soviet dissident and nobel laureate andrei 
sakharov democratic change must be accomplished through 
democratic methods peacefully through legal processes 
he mentioned only briefly the baltic republics where 
independence movements are running into soviet roadblocks 
baker urged moscow to initiate a systematic dialogue with the 
leaders of estonia latvia and lithuania so that the aspirations 
of the baltic peoples can be achieved 
there was no hint of stronger action against moscow as urged by 
many members of congress

in reply shevardnadze told baker soviet officials had no plan 
to change their approach they are committed to that the official 
said on condition of annonymity the official spoke to reporters 
aboard bakers us air force jet 
he said shevardnadze told baker that the israeli government would 
be advised that the soviet emigration policy was not being altered 
the foreign minister did not say how moscow would inform israel 
the two countries do not have formal relations but diplomats have 
exchanged visits 
baker flew to turnberry where he and shevardnadze were to attend 
a meeting of the north atlantic council both baker and his soviet 
counterpart had been in copenhagen for a 35nation human rights 
conference 
speaking at a joint news conference with president bush at the 
end of the fourday washington summit on sunday gorbachev said 
israel should not settle soviet jews in the israelioccupied west 
bank or gaza strip 
bush also objected to soviet jews being settled in the 
territories 
gorbachev said that if israel did not heed the two leaders 
advice the soviet union might further restrict exit permits 
either after these summit meetings our concern is heeded in 
israel and they will make certain conclusions or we must give 
further thought to it in terms of what we do in issuing permits for 
exit gorbachev said 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
about 20000 permits were issued last month but an estimated 1 
million soviets are waiting to emigrate 
the united states will take in 70000 soviet jews this year and 
most of the others will go to israel an estimated 750000 are 
expected to flood into that country in the next years 
arab nations have expressed concern about a possible mass 
settlement of soviet jews in the occupied lands captured by israel 
from the arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
gorbachev said two arab leaders presidents hosni mubarak of 
egypt and hafez assad of syria raised in acute terms the 
question of israeli guarantees now 
israeli officials say only about 200 soviet jews have settled in 
the territories home to 17 million palestinians and 70000 jewish 
settlers 
israeli minister of immigrant absorption yitzhak peretz has 
denied israel is settling immigrants there

the united states and its nato allies 
are considering the increased use of multinational military units as 
a way of making western troops more acceptable in a unified germany 
analysts say 
richard fieldhouse senior research associate at the natural 
resources defense council in washington described the push for 
forces with soldiers from many nations as an attempt to maintain 
some sort of nato forces within germany 
all of this comes out of the desire to present stationed forces 
in a way which is more palatable to germany and the soviet union 
said hans binnendijk director of studies at the international 
institute for strategic studies in london 
the idea of multinational forces got a boost last month when us 
defense secretary dick cheney and other defense chiefs of the north 
atlantic treaty organization called for an alliance study of their 
use they said in a final statement that they attached particular 
importance to the task 
multinational forces air sea or ground units carrying the 
flags of a variety of nations are nothing new to nato 
but the new attention reflects the alliances campaign to revamp 
its military strategy with the diminished threat from the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
moreover it must deal with the prospects of a unified germany 
west germany belongs to nato but its eastern neighbor is part of 
the crumbling warsaw pact 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union has opposed 
nato membership for a united germany he recently suggested it could 
remain in the western alliance but must withdraw from its integrated 
military structure france and spain both nato allies are outside 
the joint military command 
in the changing situation fieldhouse said it would be difficult 
for the united states to make a case for keeping a large contingent 
of troops in germany what role does the united states have as a 
nato nation in germany he asked 
binnendijk said west germans doesnt want to be different from 
their european neighbors stationed forces make them abnormal 
he said 
as a result fieldhouse predicted germans probably wont be 
interested in having 195000 americans stationed on their soil in a 
relatively short period of time 
the united states has an estimated 239000 soldiers in west 
germany and the soviet union has 380000 red army troops on east 
german soil 
washington and moscow have settled on a plan as part of arms 
control talks in vienna that would reduce their forces stationed in 
central europe to 195000 soldiers on each side the united states 
would maintain an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern 
europe 
fieldhouse also argued that the continued presence of nato troops 
in germany would enable its allies to keep some form of influence 
in german affairs 
this would be perhaps one answer to any german interest in 
building up a military he said some in europe worry about the 
resurgence of a militaristic germany in the strategic center of 
their continent 
us gen john galvin the supreme commander of alliance forces 
in europe said natos air and sea forces already are made up of 
units from various nations 
it is really only the ground forces that are somewhat lacking 
in multinationality he said in a recent interview 
galvin suggested it might be best to form multinational ground 
units at the corps level a corps is usually made up of three 
divisions of 15000 to 20000 soldiers each each division would be 
drawn from a different nation 
he said he was concerned a smaller unit would be inefficient 
there is a certain level at which multinationality begins not to 
work very well he said 
he said it was difficult for instance to have a multinational 
crew in an airplane partly because of differences in language and 
training its hard to change that in an aircraft where you need 
to be in constant communication making quick decisions he said 
in 1960 nato formed the ace mobile force which draws air and 
ground troops from belgium canada germany italy luxembourg the 
netherlands britain and the united states their mission is to 
respond rapidly in an emergency 
there are about 5000 soldiers in the land unit and two to four 
squadrons with about 20 or so planes in each squadron in the air 
force 
last year the nato composite force was created to react quickly 
to an attack in northern norway it is made up of troops from 
canada west germany norway and the united states

democratic leader george mitchell said 
wednesday an anticrime bill curbing semiautomatic weapons could be 
scuttled unless senators put a time limit on debate this week 
this is the vote on the crime bill mitchell said as senators 
prepared for a vote thursday to limit debate to 30 hours 
sponsors of the bill have been saying that without the time 
limit debating more than 241 proposed amendments would mean 
openended delays and make it impossible to vote on the overall 
legislation 
the bill would bar the import or domestic manufacture of nine 
semiautomatic assault rifles pistols and shotguns 
it also would provide for the death penalty for 30 federal 
crimes allow courts to consider evidence gathered with faulty 
warrants in some cases and move to end decadelong delays in 
carrying out death sentences 
mitchell was asked what would happen if the senate on thursday 
balked at a time limit on debate thats it the maine senator 
said sharply he suggested that the senate would then move on to 
other business and not return to the measure 
the campaign against militarylooking semiautomatic weapons began 
in january 1989 after a deranged man with an ak47 rifle opened fire 
on a stockton calif school yard leaving five dead and 30 injured 
the national rifle association has been against the plan saying 
that the assault weapons that would be restricted differ only in 
appearance from ordinary semiautomatic hunting rifles with their 
traditional brown wood stocks it says the bill would be unfair to 
hunters gun collectors and target shooters 
after senators rebuffed the nra two weeks ago and refused to drop 
the curbs lawmakers introduced scores of amendments 
but the senate on tuesday voted 5437 in favor of invoking 
cloture or imposing a time limit six votes short of the 60 needed 
the senate shelved further action on the crime package until 
after the thursday vote 
sen trent lott rmiss said on the floor wednesday that he 
cant understand why the crime package is being put off he said 
lawmakers had introduced some very good amendments to this issue 
the american people feel very strongly that the scales have 
tipped too much in favor of the criminals and against the victims 
and against the rights of society lott said 
he said there was nobody who is trying to delay this issue just 
because of the guncontrol question 
lets dont invoke cloture on thursday lets deal with these 
important amendments lott said he said americans dont 
understand parliamentary maneuver that prohibits amendments that are 
very important to them and should be on it

president bush pressed greek premier 
constantine mitsotakis today for extradition of a palestinian wanted 
for the 1982 bombing of a pan am plane over hawaii 
the new conservative greek leader the first to visit the white 
house in 26 years urged bush to prod turkey to withdraw troops from 
cyprus 
mitsokakis after talks in the oval office and a luncheon in 
bushs residence told reporters i think i was pretty convincing 
when i told the president that both as a human being and as a 
politician i will do my very best to combat terrorism 
mitsokakis soninlaw pavlos bakoyannis a member of 
parliament was assassinated on an athens street by terrorists last 
september his widow dora who subsequently won his seat in 
parliament accompanied her father to the white house 
on the us extradition request for mohammed rashid wanted for a 
1982 jet bombing that killed a japanese teenager and wounded 15 
others mitsotakis said he told bush were looking into it and we 
will decide before september 
the greek supreme court has upheld a lower courts extradition 
order the decision now rests with the countrys minister of 
justice rashid was arrested at the athens airport in may 1988 on a 
fake passport 
on the subject of cyprus white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said bush made clear that the status quo on the island is not 
satisfactory and that the united states is committed to active 
suport for the united nations secretary generals efforts to 
achieve a settlement 
asked about the possibility of an american initiative to break 
the deadlock fitzwater said the united states believes the best 
course of doing that is within the un 
fitzwater said the two leaders agreed on the importance of 
international cooperation in fighting terrorism and narcotics 
mitsotakis told the washington post beforehand that he would urge 
bush to prod the turkish government to cut its occupation forces in 
half on cyprus 
the island has been partitioned since a 1974 turkish invasion 
mitsotakis told reporters on the white house driveway i asked 
him to use all his influence in order to help settle the cyprus 
issue i told him that presently we are at a dead end and some 
gesture acting like a catalyst should be made from the turkish 
side 
he said he felt bush was highly interested in the matter 
the united states often had strained ties with mitsotakis 
socialist predecesor andreas papandreou during his eightyear 
ternure 
in the two months since mitsotakis new democracy party took 
power greece and the united states have already initialed a new 
defense agreement 
fitzwater said the two presidents agreed that this visit was 
important for a new beginning of an old friendship 
mitsotakis said it inaugurates a new period of relations 
between the two countries 
he said bush had accepted an invitation to visit greece and 
invited mitsotakis back to washington for an official visit no 
dates were set 
a base agreement initialed after just two rounds of talks will 
allow the us military presence in greece to continue but two of 
the four us bases in greece hellenikon air force base near 
athens and a naval communications station will be closed 
mitsotakiss new democracy party has 150 seats in the 300member 
parliament one deputy who represents a small conservative grouping 
is backing mitsotakis party 
the terms of the agreement will be made public once mutually 
acceptable translations are completed formal signing is expected in 
july 
during the papandreou government the two sides were unable to 
conclude a base agreement despite 17 rounds of negotiations 
as a nato ally greece is slated to receive 345 million in 
military aid during the next fiscal year

force her out by bringing deborah norville aboard today but her 
husband doonesbury cartoonist garry trudeau wasnt so sure 
his initial reaction to nbcs handling of the whole thing was 
slash and burn pauley said in an interview in julys issue of 
ladies home journal i remember him telling someone that most 
people in my position would have left tire tracks on deborahs 
back 
but not jane in fact she says she admires the way norville has 
handled all the negative publicity if it had been me getting all 
that criticism i would not have been functioning professionally i 
probably wouldnt have wanted to show my face 
pauley says she loves what shes doing now substituting for tom 
brokaw and developing primetime specials but loves getting to 
spend time with her three children twins ross and rachel 6 and 
thomas 3 even more 
if i stayed on the show she said i knew i would have less 
time with the twins because they were in school i didnt feel 
theyd hold their mother personally accountable for not being there 
but i felt guilty because i didnt have the time and 
increasingly the energy to give to them 
one of the first things she discovered when she stopped doing 
today was that her kids never tuned in to see mommy on tv 
they watch gumby and bugs bunny

each school should be able to structure its own 
program because student achievement is being stifled by 
heavyhanded politics and highhanded bureaucracy said a study 
released wednesday 
john chubb a senior fellow at brookings institution and 
stanford university political scientist terry moe said in the study 
that states should provide the schools with taxfunded scholarships 
for every eligible student enrolled 
parents and students they said then would be free to select 
either public or private schools in any district 
we found that americas current system of public education 
stifles student achievement because of heavyhanded politics and 
highhanded bureaucracy chubb said 
school performance he said is unrelated to how much is spent on 
each student teacher salaries class size and graduation 
requirements the very things the government has worked for 30 
years to change 
however california schools superintendent bill honig responded 
to the study by saying that improvements have been made in student 
achievement especially when educators use a comprehensive approach 
that includes strengthening the curriculum and teaching material 
improving teacher salaries and training and giving principals more 
control 
honig called the scholarship idea a voucher system that will 
isolate poor and minority children and will cost more because 
parents now paying for privateschool education will be subsidized 
by the government 
chubb and moe spent 10 years studying american high schools 
using surveys of more than 20000 principals teachers and students 
at about 500 high schools nationwide it is considered the largest 
survey of its kind ever conducted 
according to the study politics markets and americas 
schools an average student at an effective school has a 52 
percent chance of taking an academic program of study while that 
same student has only half that chance at an ineffective schools 
effective schools according to the study have 20 percent to 50 
percent less interference from superintendents and central offices 
in matters related to curriculum instruction hiring firing and 
discipline 
acknowledging that their proposals are controversial the authors 
included reports on successful experiments with public school choice 
in minnesota and in school districts in east harlem new york and 
cambridge mass 
schools can improve only if given the freedom and incentives to 
organize more effectively chubb said 
let the people who are in the best position to know what is 
good for students parents teachers and principals make the key 
decisions and let competition hold them accountable he said 
under the chubbmoe plan each school would be given sole 
authority to determine its own governing structure and the state 
could not dictate a schools internal organization 
gary watts of the national education association called the 
proposal impractical 
the lawsuits alone could keep an army of lawyers busy for 
years tackling such questions as who owns school buildings 
what if a private entrepreneur takes over a school or what if one 
school only wants a high quality football team he said

presbyterians aimed for unity by promoting 
harmony during their 202nd general assembly which ended wednesday 
newly elected moderator price henderson gwynn iii of charlotte 
nc set the tone for the meeting of the presbyterian church 
usa saying the church can reverse its membership slide of the 
last quartercentury as long as members stop fighting each other 
if we shoot ourselves in the foot because of internecine 
warfare or denominational myopia we are going to have to answer for 
it he said 
the 29 millionmember denomination has lost a third of its 
members since the mid1960s 
the more than 600 commissioners to the annual meeting 
overwhelmingly approved a new statement of faith postponed action 
on altering church stands on abortion and homosexuality and agreed 
to explore further relations with the mormon church 
in the land where brigham young established the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints the assembly approved the 
denominations first statement of faith since a 1983 merger healed a 
civilwar era split over slavery 
the document which mixes traditional christian beliefs with 
environmental concerns and images of god as both father and mother 
will be sent to the denominations 177 presbyteries 
if the confession is approved by twothirds of the regional 
groups and by the 1991 general assembly it will become the 11th 
statement of faith in the denominations book of confessions 
while noting the discrimination faced by nonmormons in utah the 
assembly also accepted a report calling for opening up an informal 
dialogue with the mormon church 
several resolutions relating to abortion and homosexuality were 
postponed until 1991 when a special task force on human sexuality 
is scheduled to make its report the denomination supports legalized 
abortion and opposes the ordination of homosexuals 
they seem to be bending over backwards to be kind to one 
another and avoid controversial issues parker t williamson of 
the presbyterian layman said after the votes to defer action 
but in a move criticized by several commissioners as avoiding 
dispute at the price of suppressing dissent the assembly voted to 
take away semiofficial church status from 21 presbyterian 
organizations including some of the denominations staunchest 
liberal and conservative critics 
the discussion was sparked by an uproar caused last summer when 
presbyterians for lesbiangay concerns distributed sexually explicit 
pamphlets to high school and college youths at a church meeting 
the assembly vote which still must be approved by a majority of 
the regional presbyteries would take away the right to be 
officially represented at church meeting from not only the 
homosexual caucus but other liberal groups such as the witherspoon 
society and conservative groups such as the presbyterian lay 
committee and presbyterians prolife

groups representing thousands of small east 
german businesses said on wednesday that the terms of german 
unification will force them to lay off 350000 workers this summer 
klaus noack leader of an independent business association said 
half of the nations 500000 small and mediumsized businesses may 
have to declare bankruptcy this year 
noack and two other groups the chamber of commerce and the 
entrepreneurs association said they would call a warning 
strike on the baltic sea island of ruegen on tuesday and a 
nationwide strike the next day unless parliament acted on their 
demands 
the main complaint is a key provision of an economic treaty under 
which east germany and west germany are to merge their economies on 
july 2 the principal stage of full unification 
the treaty which still must be ratified by both parliaments 
calls for east germanys essentially worthless currency to be 
replaced by the powerful west german mark 
workers will have their wages converted to west german marks at 
an equal 11 exchange but business bank accounts will be converted 
at a 21 rate in effect halving their cash reserves in relation to 
their employee payrolls 
noack said that will force perhaps half of the small and 
mediumsized businesses to file for bankruptcy and immediately 
eliminate 350000 jobs 
he claimed the treaty would eventually threaten almost 3 million 
of east germanys 10 million workers 
the business groups said at a news conference that they also need 
the property on which their businesses stand to be protected from 
western investers 
the german governments are still negotiating how to transfer the 
vast publicly owned property in the country to the private sector 
many east germans fear that west germans will buy up their property 
noack said the businesses need their property to use as 
collateral to obtain loans to keep operating and become competitive 
with western firms already selling their products in east germany 
prime minister lothar de maizieres cabinet met on wednesday and 
endorsed a plan to promote small businesses that includes extending 
credit to them said spokesman klauspeter bigalke but he said 
there were no details worked out 
analysts say that between 500000 and 4 million east germans will 
lose their jobs as outmoded overstaffed factories and other 
businesses are forced to compete with western businesses 
east german labor minister regine hildebrandt said wednesday that 
she expected 1 million to lose their jobs 
much of the unemployment is expected to hit the vast industrial 
sector where the huge staterun factories many of which are 
considered environmental hazards are expected to lure little 
private investment or be able to compete with leaner western 
industries 
both german governments are counting on western investment to 
create new jobs in east germany and alleviate the initial effects of 
the countrys move to a free market

south korean president roh taewoo reporting 
at the white house on groundbreaking talks with mikhail s 
gorbachev said wednesday that the soviet president had agreed to 
help melt down the ice from the cold war on the troubled korean 
peninsula 
after briefing president bush roh said his talks with gorbachev 
definitely will help reduce tensions between north and south 
korea and help greatly the process of reunification 
bush said rohs meeting with gorbachev was very appropriate 
and very important 
if a peace settlement is reached with communist north korea roh 
told reporters later we can talk about further reductions or 
reallocation of the 40000 american troops stationed in south 
korea 
roh met with gorbachev in san francisco on monday as the soviet 
leader wrapped up a sixday visit in the united states it was the 
first highlevel encounter between the two nations since korea was 
divided after world war ii 
the administration hopes that without the unswerving support of 
moscow north korea will be inclined to seek friendlier ties with 
south korea and the industrialized west 
however the white house said there was no warming in us ties 
with north korea along the lines of improved relations between seoul 
and moscow 
we have always indicated a willingness to improve relations 
with north korea but we have not seen any reciprocal response on 
their part white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
at this point i cant report any movement 
roh talking with reporters outside the white house said he had 
sought gorbachevs help in bringing north korea closer to south 
korea 
the south korean leader said they had agreed that we have to 
cooperate so that we can melt down the ice which still exists from 
the cold war years 
asked about prospects for reunification roh said north korea 
must first open up and embark on a reform process 
he said gorbachev agreed to combine efforts along that line 
the south korean leaders meeting with gorbachev occurred just 
three weeks short of the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of the 
korean war in which moscow was the major arms supplier of north 
korea while washington played the same role for south korea 
the weapons deliveries by the two superpowers have continued 
unabated ever since 
relations between moscow and seoul hit a low point seven years 
ago when a soviet warplane shot down a korean commercial airliner 
that had strayed over soviet territory all 269 people aboard were 
killed

a wide crosssection of american churches have 
praised the us supreme court decision allowing high school 
religious clubs saying it checks discrimination against religion 
the reactions came from mainline and evangelical denominations 
protestants eastern orthodox and roman catholics however jewish 
groups demurred 
millions of american students are the real winners in this 
case a coalition of protestants said tuesday they now can 
claim the right of equal access for their religious political and 
philosophical speech 
the decision monday upholds equal rights of students to form 
religion clubs if any kind of extracurricular clubs are allowed 
congress in 1984 called for such equal access but many schools 
circumvented it 
commenting on the courts decision the protestant organizations 
said it helps corrects an almost paranoid fear of faith shown by 
some schools and added 
some school districts have gone so far as to single out student 
religious groups for discriminatory treatment by telling them that 
they alone cannot hold oncampus meetings before or after school 
but the court decision makes clear that such a policy violates 
federal law and the decision also restores a proper balance 
between churchstate separation and guarantees of free exercise of 
religion the organizations said 
they included the national council of churches embracing 
mainline denominations the national association of evangelicals 
the baptist joint committee on public affairs and the christian 
legal society 
the us catholic conference on wednesday joined protestants in 
hailing the decision saying that it modified a trend toward 
exclusion of religion from the public schools 
the american jewish congress called the decision regrettable 
the decision will open up the nations public high schools to 
proselytizing from organized student religion clubs and create 
religious divisiveness said ajc president robert k lifton

cashstrapped democrats dianne feinstein and harvey gantt had 
little time wednesday to savor primary victories as they plunged 
into campaigns against wellfinanced republicans 
the democratic party chairman conceded the money advantage but 
proclaimed issues are going to prevail in november 
sen pete wilson sitting on a 35 million campaign war chest 
after coasting to victory in the republican primary for governor of 
california welcomed feinstein to the fray and warned that her 
election night celebration would be your last victory party of the 
1990s 
feinstein who quickly won a pledge of support from her defeated 
primary rival said she was optimistic about the fall we do have 
a united democratic party thats now able to appeal to the 
independents and the republicans 
north carolina democrats gave gantt the black former mayor of 
charlotte a strong sendoff into a senate challenge to conservative 
republican jesse helms regarded as the underdog in the democratic 
primary runoff gantt picked up 57 percent of the vote to roll over 
prosecutor mike easley 
youre talking about a newly awakened voter in north 
carolina said national democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
youre talking about a candidate who has touched some chords 
there 
while candidates who competed in primaries in nine states 
celebrated their victories or licked their wounds much of the 
postelection attention centered not on a candidate but on voter 
approval of a california ballot initiative that will double the 
state gasoline tax over the next five years 
supporters as well as some opponents of the ballot proposition 
touted the vote as the end of the tax revolt that began in 1978 when 
california voters passed proposition 13 that cut property taxes in 
half and put a lid on future increases 
it really does end the tax revolt in california and sends a 
message to washington which i dislike intensely said antitax 
economist arthur laffer 
brown was more cautious 
im not sure we ought to read too much into it he said of 
the california tax vote folks are saying we want a cleaner 
environment and do something about gridlock on the freeways 
but the democratic chairman was celebrating the decisive defeat 
of two republicansponsored california ballot initiatives that would 
have stripped the state legislature of most of its power to redraw 
political boundaries to conform to the 1990 census the democrats 
control both chambers of the california legislature 
incumbents were uniformly successful on tuesday including seven 
senators four governors and all house members who sought 
renomination the success stories included rep jim bates of 
california who survived a democratic primary challenge despite 
having been rebuked by the house ethics committee for sexual 
harassment of women employees 
one race that remained to be decided was in alabama where 
teachers union official paul hubbert and attorney general don 
siegelman will clash in a june 26 runoff for the democratic 
nomination to oppose republican gov guy hunt 
while wilson was expected to raise and spend up to 20 million in 
an effort to keep the california governors office in republican 
control feinstein emerged from her bruising primary against 
attorney general john van de kamp with an empty campaign treasury 
the former san francisco mayor spent about 6 million in the 
primary including 3 million she and richard blum her investment 
banker husband poured into the campaign 
gantt will be up against a conservative senator with one of the 
nations most successful fundraising networks helms spent 17 
million on his 1984 reelection campaign 
they are going to have a money advantage said brown of the 
republicans the issues are going to prevail he added 
at a rally in raleigh nc gantt challenged helms to join him 
in joint appearances at every courthouse in the state to campaign 
the oldfashioned way 
i hope we dont get into those obscene amounts of money we saw 
in 1984 said the democratic candidate 
gantt lost no time focusing on the issues he felt would work 
against helms education the environment and abortion 
we have a senator in washington who just hasnt been paying 
attention who hasnt been paying attention to the problem of our 
young peoples education in this state gantt said 
gantt drew a clear contrast to helms opposition to abortion 
its not the business of government to interfere with a womans 
right to choose he said staking out a position parallel to that 
taken last year by fellow democrat l douglas wilder of virginia 
when he became the first black elected governor of any state

they dont look back with bitterness but 
people who lived through pivotal civil rights battlefields of the 
1950s reunited this week and said the nation still hasnt conquered 
racism 
after 36 years to me its very disheartening to see that the 
struggle continues said linda brown buckner who as a child had 
to walk across town past white schools to a attend one of topekas 
black schools 
her name went on the lawsuit that prompted the us supreme court 
to rule in 1954 that segregated schools were unconstitutional 
brown appeared tuesday on a panel that discussed the 1954 case 
the event was part of a conference on president eisenhowers role in 
the civil rights movement 
brown noted that the brown vs topeka board of education lawsuit 
still isnt resolved it was reopened 11 years ago and federal 
courts have ruled that the board still hasnt removed a pattern of 
unequal schools 
i think the vestiges of segregation are alive and well all you 
have to do is look at topeka to see that the east side is mainly 
black and the west side is mainly white she said 
former arkansas gov orval faubus who in 1957 used the national 
guard to block nine black children from a little rock high school 
also appeared on a panel with four of those students 
eisenhower drew international attention to race relations in the 
south by sending the 101st airborne division into little rock so the 
nine could attend central high 
the conference was at eisenhowers presidential library in this 
eastcentral kansas town of abilene which he called home 
hugh speer a key plaintiff witness in the brown case criticized 
the current topeka board of education for continuing to fight court 
orders to desegregate 
the big question is whether topeka has lived up to the 1954 
decision when they still have three or four schools that are 
predominantly minority speer said 
he said the board was spending more on appealing the reopened 
case to the us supreme court than it would cost to simply comply 
with the integration orders the high court has yet to decide 
whether to hear the reopened case 
the little rock panelists some of them meeting faubus for the 
first time agreed that racism was far from solved 
we have to remove our own cases of apartheid said ernest 
green 
faubus 80 defended his action aimed at blocking implementation 
of the brown case 
it was my responsibility to maintain order as much as possible 
and see that no one was injured and there was no property damage 
he said we came out all right were all here

stations on tuesday in and around osh according to tass the city 
is in the densely populated western part of kirghizia on the border 
with uzbekistan 
soviet media including the tv news program vremya wednesday 
blamed the violence on widespread unemployment among youth in the 
region and general poverty housing is also critically short in 
soviet central asia and the land dispute centered on plots where 
individual houses could be built 
lukyanov speaking wednesday to the supreme soviet said the 
difficult process of regulating the conflict is going on he asked

red star reported that the only enterprise that stayed open tuesday 
in osh was a large bakery 
in uzgen 35 miles from osh deaths and injuries occurred when 
the district police headquarters was attacked the newspaper said

acres of fallow land but baktiyor hamidov head of the economic 
department of uzbekistans mission in moscow said in an interview 
that there is much more land at issue he said 618000 acres of 
cotton fields near the border are being made available by the uzbek 
government and local kirghiz authorities are controlling it 
they began dividing it between the families of mostly kirghiz 
descent he said and the uzbeks demanded it be divided evenly

populated with 500 to 1125 people per square mile he said 
disputes over land have their roots dating back to 1924 when

the senate on wednesday endorsed a change in a 
major civil rights bill to allow aids sufferers to be reassigned 
from food handling duties 
the vote was a major electionyear victory for sen jesse helms 
rnc and a setback for majority leader george mitchell helms is 
seeking a fourth term 
on a voice vote the senate approved a nonbinding motion by 
helms to have the americans with disabilities act include an 
exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected workers 
from foodhandling jobs 
helms motion instructs senate negotiators to accept a 
houseadopted exemption when they work out a final version of the 
bill later this month 
sen tom harkin the iowa democrat who sponsored the senate 
measure said the amendment would codify ignorance about the 
disease and how it is transmitted 
the house approved the exemption 199187 last month before it 
finally passed the entire disabilities act 40320 the senate passed 
the bill 768 last september 
the amendment goes right at the heart and soul of the americans 
with disabilities act said harkin to pass legislation in 
spite of the clear and convincing overwhelming medical evidence 
that hiv that aids cannot be transmitted either through air or 
through food is simply to codify ignorance 
but helms renewing the house debate argued that scientific 
knowledge and public perception clash he expressed doubts over the 
certainty of knowledge about how aids is transmitted and argued that 
the amendment was needed because of public ignorance 
weve been told over and over again aids is supposedly not 
communicable by food or drink or casual contact helms said now 
that is the conventional wisdom but you try telling that to john q 
public 
because the helms motion was approved on a voice vote no 
individual senators vote was recorded however the senate voted 
5340 to reject an earlier motion by mitchell a maine democrat to 
table the helms motion 
the house version of the amendment would allow employers to 
reassign hivinfected workers from foodhandling jobs provided 
other positions exist for which they are qualified opponents say 
that means infected people could be fired or demoted 
the house adopted the amendment even though health and human 
services secretary louis w sullivan said it was unnecessary the 
white house has not however spoken out against the amendment 
although it specifically endorsed another unrelated change 
the house amendment was introduced by rep jim chapman dtexas 
it was endorsed by the restaurant and foodservice industry as 
well as by the national federation of independent business a chief 
critic of the entire disabilities bill 
were enormously disappointed at the senate vote today and view 
it as a significant setback in the effort to protect people with 
aids from unnecessary discrimination said gregory l king of the 
human rights campaign fund a lobbying group for gay and lesbian 
rights 
ten years into the epidemic one can only be shocked that so 
many senators are unwilling to recognize that aids is not spread 
through casual contact or through food 
the disabilities act has been hailed as the most significant 
piece of civil rights legislation since the 1964 civil rights act 
which banned discrimination against racial minorities 
it would protect the estimated 43 million disabled americans from 
job discrimination it also would guarantee them access to 
businesses entertainment accommodations and professional services 
as well as to public and private transportation and telephone 
service

the superpowers could cut their arsenals of 
longrange nuclear weapons by three times the amount planned in a 
nearly completed treaty without endangering security us and 
soviet scientists said wednesday 
the groups said in a jointly published book that the united 
states and the soviet union could reduce the number of strategic 
nuclear warheads to fewer than 2000 each without giving either side 
an incentive to launch a first strike 
in the strategic arms reduction talks in geneva us and soviet 
negotiators are trying to complete a start treaty to reduce to 6000 
the number of warheads on weapons capable of reaching each others 
territory that would represent about a 30 percent cut from current 
levels 
at last weeks summit meeting in washington president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reaffirmed their commitment to 
completing the start treaty and agreed to pursue negotiations on 
further reductions once the treaty is signed and ratified 
the federation of american scientists and the committee of soviet 
scientists for global security proposed a new way of structuring 
arms reduction treaties 
it would be based on eliminating warheads not just the vehicles 
such as bombers ballistic missiles or missile launchers that carry 
the warheads to targets 
the start treaty as drafted includes no prohibitions against 
removing warheads from longrange missiles and converting them for 
use on other weapons both the american and soviet governments say 
dismantlement of warheads would give away vital secret information 
about the design of their weapons 
the scientists also said that for warhead dismantlement to be 
effective the superpowers should agree also to halt production of 
new fissionable materials including plutonium and enriched uranium 
used in warheads 
there is growing congressional interest in pursuing a ussoviet 
agreement to halt nuclear materials production but the bush 
administration is opposed 
the scientists noted that both moscow and washington already have 
been forced to reduce their nuclear materials production because of 
safety problems in manufacturing 
just this week new evidence emerged to indicate that problems at 
a key us weapons plant are more serious that previously believed 
a panel of nuclear safety experts commissioned by the energy 
department to advise energy secretary james d watkins on weapons 
production facilities said tuesday that plans for resuming plutonium 
processing at the rocky flats plant in colorado should be further 
delayed to correct numerous training and pollution problems 
rocky flats the nations only supplier of plutonium triggers for 
nuclear warheads was closed indefinitely in november because of 
safety and management concerns 
watkins had indicated recently that he hoped to restart rocky 
flats this month and that its operation was vital to maintaining the 
nations nuclear weapons stockpile 
he had no immediate comment on the advisory panels 
recommendation 
in a related development the author of a new report by the 
private arms control association in washington told reporters that 
congress was likely to slash 1991 spending for the star wars 
antimissile defense by more than 20 percent from 1990 levels 
matthew bunn an arms control specialist said it was likely 
congress would approve about 3 billion in spending for star wars 
officially the strategic defense initiative for the budget year 
beginning oct 1 
the current budget is 38 billion and the bush administration 
wants 48 billion for 1991

there are no plans for jane pauley to coanchor 
the nbc nightly news but that could change nbc affiliates were 
told wednesday 
nbc news president michael gartner told affiliate executives that 
in a closeddoor meeting at the end of their annual convention here 
according to network spokeswoman betty hudson 
he specifically said we never say never but there are no 
current plans for pauley to join brokaw on the show hudson told 
reporters in a briefing 
nbc television network president pier mapes emphasized that 
pauleys first priority is a series of primetime specials she will 
anchor 
pauley who left nbcs troubled today show in december after 
controversial changes there is really hot for the primetime 
show he said 
pauley who got a standing ovation monday from the station 
executives also will do special reports for nightly and fill in 
for brokaw when he is on assignment or vacation 
her primetime project mapes said is a fulltime job in 
itself 
the question about pauleys future on nightly was raised by 
an affiliate executive after published speculation she may coanchor 
the newscast 
at the briefing former affiliate board chairman james sefert and 
his successor eric bremner also disputed a report that the 
threeday convention had been nbcs gloomiest since 1985 
it was upbeat said sefert president of cosmos broadcasting in 
greenville sc 
but he and bremner president of king broadcasting in seattle 
said there was far more work done including a mass march by 
affiliates on capitol hill than ever before 
affiliates are worried about cables growing effect on stations 
and federal financial interest and syndication rules on nbc and are 
seeking ways to help themselves and their network he said 
although nbc has finished first in prime time for five seasons 
mapes said the network faces a 200 million shortfall in 
advertising revenues because of lower primetime ratings and 
problems he blamed on the peoplemeter ratings ssytem 
half the problem is the peoplemeter problem he said 
the networks blame peoplemeters the industrys national ratings 
standard since 1987 for what they call an undercounting of viewers 
nielsen officials say network drops in viewing are real 
at the closeddoor meeting nbc executives fielded questions on a 
variety of other subjects including cablecasts of pro football 
games not available to nbc stations in certain markets 
remedying that may end up being an fcc matter mapes said 
adding that nbc officials will take it up with the federal 
communications commission 
although there had been speculation that gartner would be the 
target of affiliate grumbles over the today changes and the 
shows drop into second place in the ratings there was no criticism 
at wednesdays meeting several station executives said 
i was quite quiet today joked rhode island executive david 
henderson who last year sharply criticzed gartner for what 
henderson considered nbcs poor coverage of the bloody crackdown on 
the student revolution in beijing 
i think everybody is supportive of gartner now that he has 
announced changes aimed at making both today and nbc nightly 
news ratings contenders again henderson said 
its true most affiliates were disappointed at what happened 
to today said another station executive john williams of 
paducah ky 
but he defused the criticism williams said referring to 
gartners frank admission to affiliates monday that he made mistakes 
with today and his showmending moves including the hiring of 
former today host joe garagiola as a third cohost with byrant 
gumbel and deborah norville 
the convention was nbcs first in washington and underscored the 
affiliates increasing attention to making themselves heard on 
legislative and regulatory issues affecting broadcasting

a kayaking enthusiast appeared to 
wave his paddle triumphantly before plunging over niagara falls and 
that was the last anyone has seen of him 
jessie sharp of ocoee tenn plunged over the 182foot horseshoe 
falls on the canadian side of the border tuesday afternoon as 
tourists and police unable to help him looked on 
he was wearing neither a helmet nor a lifejacket 
his paddle emerged from the mist at the base of the falls about 
10 minutes after his plunge the dented red kayak inscribed 
rapidman surfaced about an hour later a few hundred yards 
downstream 
a day after the stunt sharps body had yet to surface it 
could be down there for weeks said niagara parks police constable 
maureen quinn 
the river below the falls is too dangerous for divers to try to 
search for the body quinn said 
sharp 28 was the 13th known daredevil to challenge the falls 
since 1901 and the fourth to lose his life all previous attempts on 
record have involved barrels or inflated rubber containers 
had sharp survived his trip he would have been subject to a 
10000 canadian fine for attempting an illegal stunt quinn said 
police interviewed three friends who accompanied sharp from 
tennessee but decided not to charge them quinn said 
they didnt assist him in any criminal way she said 
jeff latham a parks police constable who watched sharps plunge 
said the kayaker held his paddle aloft and twirled it in the air 
just before going over the brink 
latham said the gesture reminded him of a football player spiking 
the ball in the end zone but kayakers said they generally lean back 
and raise the paddle above their head just before a fall as a 
protective measure 
ocoee a small town 35 miles from chattanooga in southeast 
tennessee is on the ocoee river a nationally famous whitewater 
stream the us slalom team trials were held there in early may 
jim snyder an albright wva author predicted in a 1987 book 
that kayak technology and skill levels would evolve to the point 
that making it over niagara falls would be possible that time is 
yet to arrive he said tuesday night 
you need a very specific plan to do a falls over 80 feet he 
said you should be in a boat specially designed to support your 
back and you have to have a perfect launch anything less than that 
spells disaster 
a kayaker trying to navigate a tall waterfall also must paddle 
hard just before the brink so he shoots out away from the falling 
water to land in the foam below snyder said 
if you fall with the water youve failed he said if he 
and his boat were not visible during the fall he was doomed from 
the beginning

president hashemi rafsanjani urged the united 
states wednesday to press israel and kuwait to release moslem 
prisoners in exchange for help in gaining freedom for the 16 western 
captives in lebanon 
rafsanjani also indicated iran might soon begin direct peace 
talks with iraq to formally end the persian gulf war 
the irresponsible arrogant attitude of the united states has 
created further difficulties in resolving the hostage crisis 
rafsanjani told a news conference for 200 foreign and local 
journalists 
iran and the proiranian groups holding the hostages in lebanon 
have often demanded the united states press israel to free 350 
moslems it holds in israel and in a strip of land it controls in 
southern lebanon 
but it was the first time in some months that an iranian leader 
referred to 15 shiite moslems most of iranian origin jailed in 
kuwait since 1984 for car bombings in kuwait directed against the 
us and french embassies 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said he had not seen rafsanjanis remarks but that us policy is to 
urge the immediate safe and unconditional release of all 
hostages 
at tehrans bidding two american educators robert polhill and 
frank reed were released in april iran has said washington should 
make a goodwill gesture in return president bush has said he wont 
deal with iran to secure further hostage releases 
an appropriate response was expected after the lebanese 
unconditionally set free the hostages release of hostages in 
kuwait and israel rafsanjani said 
why dont you help increase the necessary public pressure on 
those governments to release these hostages so that the western 
hostages can be freed in return he asked the journalists 
if the united states is serious about wanting relations with 
iran in the future it must begin to act because talking is not 
enough rafsanjani said 
polhill and reed were the first us captives to be released in 
3 years six americans are among the westerners still held in 
lebanon the longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was abducted in march 
1985 
the other hostages are four britons two west germans two swiss 
an italian and an irishman 
referring to irans death threats against british author salman 
rushdie rafsanjani said ties with london could be resumed if prime 
minister margaret thatcher condemns rushdies book the satanic 
verses ties between the nations were severed following the 1989 
call for moslems to execute rushdie 
rafsanjani said however that there was no question of lifting 
the death sentence on rushdie who iran says defamed islam in his 
book 
rafsanjani said irans policy was to help secure the release of 
all the hostages whether they be western lebanese or iranian we 
continued to hold on to this policy 
the iranian president reiterated his countrys claim that four 
iranians two diplomats a journalist and a driver who were 
kidnapped by the christian lebanese forces militia in 1982 are still 
alive 
we have learned officially from a government and from reliable 
sources in east beirut that the iranian hostages are alive 
rafsanjani said the special envoy of a certain government has 
informed us 
he did not identify the country 
the bush administration recently provided iran with information 
through the swiss government which washington said indicated the 
four men were dead 
speaking about the gulf war rafsanjani said president saddam 
hussein of iraq recently sent two letters to the iranian leadership 
suggesting the two leaders meet for talks on a permanent settlement 
to the conflict which ended in a ceasefire in august 1988 
we have not given a negative reply to iraqs proposal calling 
for a meeting of the two heads of state rafsanjani said 
but issues must be sorted out in preliminary negotiations at 
expert level and in consultations with the united nations 
secretarygeneral to guarantee the success of such a meeting if 
there is going to be one 
hostilities between iran and iraq were halted under un security 
council resolution but talks to turn the truce into a peace 
settlement have been stalemated ever since

federal regulators assured members of congress 
wednesday that a government crackdown on bank lending is not the 
cause of a credit squeeze in some regions 
behind closed doors however bankers are pleading with the 
regulators to ease up 
senior federal banking officials appearing before the house 
small business committee conceded that some banks are making it 
more difficult for businesses to get loans particularly for 
commercial real estate projects 
but they said that is mostly a justified response to a sluggish 
economy rather than a reaction to intensified scrutiny from 
government examiners 
meanwhile chief executives of some of the nations largest banks 
have asked the federal reserve board to bend capital standards while 
they work off losses from sour real estate loans 
the request came from the feds 12member advisory council at a 
private may 3 meeting in washington the central bank keeps the 
minutes of the councils sessions secret for three years but a copy 
from last months meeting was obtained by the associated press 
the council suggested that regulators should permit banks to 
deduct real estate loan losses from their earnings over a period of 
years rather than all at once they also asked for relaxed capital 
rules to permit banks to hold on to repossessed real estate rather 
than selling it in a depressed market 
such accounting measures while maintaining the appearance of 
balanced books have been blamed for contributing to the savings and 
loan crisis 
the councils request to the fed for lenience was originally 
disclosed in wednesday editions of usa today 
regulators told the small business panel chaired by rep john j 
lafalce dny that they have cautioned their examiners not to be 
overzealous in scrutinizing loans 
but for the most part they stood firm in the face of strong 
congressional criticism that creditworthy constituents were having 
trouble getting loans 
a slowdown in certain markets seems entirely warranted given 
current economic conditions said federal reserve board member 
john p laware 
in my view banks should be applauded for tightening lending 
standards said paul g fritts supervision director for the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
he said regulators critics are confusing a normal credit 
contraction during a time of economic downturn with a credit crunch 
in which legitimate projects cannot attract financing 
he said bankers often use regulators as an excuse for a decision 
that angers a customer 
however rep richard e neal dmass whose state has been 
among the hardest hit by a slump in real estate said regardless 
of whats been stated today a perception has been created that a 
curtain has been dropped over some of the entrepreneurship that 
weve witnessed in new england over the last decade 
del walter fauntroy ddc complained about scarcity of 
business loans in the nations capital 
some banks throttled their lending down so sharply that some 
members of the house banking committee began to fear a 
fullfledged credit crunch he said i am here to urge the 
regulators to moderate their approach

more women candidates than ever will be on 
californias general election ballot in november when dianne 
feinstein will ask voters to make her the states first woman 
governor 
besides feinstein four of five women who were seeking 
nominations to statewide office won their party primaries tuesday 
and voters ensured that one general election race will be between 
two women 
no more than two women have ever been on a california general 
election ballot before 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco made a special plea 
to women throughout her democratic primary campaign to help her 
make history as californias first woman governor 
us sen pete wilson the republican nominee immediately moved 
to defuse that appeal wednesday 
i think that women as well as men are going to be much more 
influenced by the quality of candidates by their performance by 
their ideas than by their sex wilson said 
after a costly bruising primary campaign feinstein defeated 
state attorney general john van de kamp by a 52to41 percent 
margin in final unofficial returns feinstein had 1296589 votes 
to van de kamps 1012516 
wilson received 88 percent of the republican vote against only 
token opposition 
an exit poll by the los angeles times reported that feinstein won 
nearly twothirds of the womens vote and narrowly edged van de 
kamp among male voters 
asked wednesday what her nomination proved feinstein said no 
mountain is too high and no door is so closed it cant be opened 
other women who won tuesday included 
state sen marian bergeson who won the republican nomination 
for lieutenant governor 
kathleen brown daughter of former gov pat brown and sister of 
former gov jerry brown who captured the democratic nomination for 
state treasurer 
democrat march fong eu and republican joan milke flores who won 
their parties nominations for secretary of state eu is the 
incumbent and one of only two women to ever win a statewide office 
in californias 140year history 
eus victory marked a first of a different kind since her son 
matthew fong won the republican nomination for state controller 
never before have a mother and son run for state office at the same 
time in california 
the only woman seeking a statewide office who didnt make it to 
the november ballot was former us treasurer angela bay 
buchanan sister of conservative political commentator pat buchanan 
she lost the republican nomination for state treasurer to incumbent 
tom hayes by 8 percentage points 
oakland mayor lionel wilson who was heavily criticized in his 
failed attempt to bring the los angeles raiders football team back 
to oakland was soundly defeated in his bid for a fifth term 
the primary balloting also marked both in symbolism and 
substance a reversal of political priorities from the antitax 
philosophy that dominated the 1980s as californians voted to double 
their state gasoline taxes from 9 to 18 cents per gallon 
the gasoline tax increase approved by a 53 percent majority is 
expected to raise 155 billion over the next decade for new highway 
and mass transit projects to ease the states growing traffic 
congestion 
in some of californias 45 congressional races 
democratic incumbent jim bates was nominated for a fifth term 
despite the negative publicity of a formal rebuke by the house 
ethics committee for sexual harassment of women employees 
actor ralph waite papa walton of the television series won 
the democratic nomination for a seat now held by republican al mc 
candless in the palm springs area 
tim stoen attorney for the peoples temple before the cults 
mass suicide with 912 deaths over a decade ago lost the republican 
nomination to oppose democratic incumbent doug bosco in californias

after a decade of trying to reach planes 
buried in arctic ice since world war ii a thermal borer wednesday 
banged against the skin of a b17 
the bomber is one of eight planes two b17s and six 
twinengine p38 lightning fighters that crashlanded on the 
greenland icecap they ran out of fuel en route to europe after 
being decoyed by false radio transmissions from german submarines in 
1942 
pat epps who with richard taylor cofounded the greenland 
expedition society heard by radio from greenland on wednesday 
morning that the group had succeeded in reaching the plane 
theyre going to try to enlarge the hole to get into a hatch 
said epps owner of an air service in suburban atlanta 
taylor planned to descend 250 feet to the plane through a 42inch 
shaft epps said 
we plan to get the fighters out this year we will work until 
september 1 said epps who returned from the icecap last week 
the team left atlanta on may 3 for greenland a second unit led 
by angelo pizzagalli of burlington vt left a week later 
while taylor and the first group got to the first bomber 
pizzagalli president of pizzagalli construction co and his men 
used a huge auger to bore a hole 16 feet in diameter to one of the 
p38s a plane the germans called a forktailed devil 
they fell behind schedule because of bad weather including two 
blizzards after they landed on the ice in southeastern greenland 
the eight planes crashlanded july 15 1942 their crews camped 
in one of the b17s for nine days until a sled dog team which 
mushed into a spot fixed by radio triangulation arrived to lead 
them to the coast 
a month later officials learned the norden bombsight on one of 
the bombers had not been destroyed so army air force col norman 
vaughan went in alone by dogsled to get it before it could fall into 
the hands of the germans who had weather stations in the area 
vaughan a vice president of the greenland expedition society is 
among the crew of a dozen men working on the icecap 
the planes were forgotten until the early 1970s when col carl 
rudder one of the p38 pilots mentioned them to roy degan a 
commercial airline pilot who brought the idea of an arctic 
expedition to epps 
epps and taylor founded the greenland expedition society in 1981 
vaughan of trapper creek alaska learned about the group from a 
newspaper story and joined up 
the society eventually obtained search and salvage rights from 
the government of denmark which owns greenland 
in 1988 the society found the aircraft using lowfrequency 
subsurface radar last year expedition members drilled down to the 
b17 and brought back poker chipsize pieces of its skin 
epps declined to say how much money the society has raised or 
spent on its efforts but he estimated it will have spent 800000 
to 1 million by sept 1 it is financed by its own fundraising 
efforts and the work of rolls ltd pizzagallis nonprofit 
corporation in vermont

petty thieves vandalized abraham 
lincolns tomb creating a permanent eyesore while stealing 100 in 
small change 
the vandals rolled a pair of 200pound urns from atop the tomb 
onto granite steps leading to an observation deck chipping the 
steps and they broke into a vault where the 16th presidents body 
was kept temporarily after his death where they stole coins left by 
tourists 
they didnt enter the 116yearold chamber where lincoln is 
entombed 
the urns can be replaced but the steps will always be 
broken said monument manager nan wynn estimating damage at 
1600 
the thieves apparently used bolt cutters to get into the empty 
burial vault where lincolns body was kept until the tomb was built

a flight attendant a paper mill worker and a 
tool and die employee all stung by long labor disputes asked a 
senate panel wednesday to approve a bill that would ban the hiring 
of permanent replacement workers 
the three witnesses described how they had suffered because 
companies favored replacement workers or strikers who crossed picket 
lines 
i will suffer the effects of filing bankruptcy for many years 
because it will be difficult to obtain credit and impossible to 
obtain a mortgage said norma adams of new york a trans world 
airlines flight attendant 
she said she was on strike for two months but had to wait nearly 
a year before resuming her work 
we only have to look at history to realize that greed and power 
are destructive said thomas j pratt of livermore falls maine a 
former international paper co employee 
lets balance the power between corporations and its employees 
and hopefully they can reconcile differences without the use of 
strikes or lockouts he said 
ms adams pratt and carol miller of woodstock ill said their 
employers deliberately sought to anger unions during contract talks 
so they could hire replacement workers at a lower cost 
appearing before a senate labor subcommittee the three witofficials 
who will study the food processing systems of the two 
countries and determine how us technology and methods can be 
incorporated into the soviet system 
a high proportion of soviet food production has been reported to 
spoil because of inefficient distribution handling and storage 
before it reaches the consumer 
nikitin said the agreement was a small step but everything 
starts with a small step 
for you its a key if you want to participate in the 
strengthening of our economy he said through an interpreter 
the pact was signed on the last day of a threeday conference 
sponsored by the food processing machinery amp supplies association 
and the national food processors association 
fiftyfive soviet officials met with representatives of more than 
50 food companies administration and congressional officials 
seeking deals that could lead to increased business for americans 
and modernization of food distribution for the soviet union 
john cady president of the food processors association said 
barriers are beginning to come down though americans still are 
concerned about getting paid for business with the soviets 
soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market 
leaving those companies doing business in the soviet union to either 
accept products in exchange or wait for longterm gains after the 
economy there improves 
we have to understand when companies invest its not going to 
be a threeyear turnaround but probably eight to 10 years said 
cady

chinese immigrants who adopt the typical 
american diet and lifestyle are four to seven times more likely to 
develop colorectal cancer than those people who remain in china a 
researcher said wednesday 
a lack of exercise and lots of rich american foods containing 
saturated fats make the difference said alice s whittemore of 
stanford university 
if you want to avoid the disease i would by all means stay 
active she said in a telephone interview even more 
importantly take it easy on rich high fat dairy products and very 
fatty red meat eating fish and chicken is certainly prudent 
the study published this week in the journal of the national 
cancer institute is based on interviews with chinese in the 
peoples republic of china and with chineseamericans who immigrated 
to the united states or whose parents immigrated 
about 90 percent of the chineseamericans interviewed came to the 
united states as young adults 
of those chosen for interviews 473 americans and 432 chinese had 
either colon or rectal cancer the researchers also interviewed 
1192 chineseamericans and 1295 people in china who were free of 
disease but who lived near those with the cancers 
the interviews probed diet exercise and other habits of all the 
subjects 
for the chineseamericans ms whittemore said the interviewers 
explored every aspect of westernization including such things as 
use of herbal medicines languages spoken at home and even which 
newspapers were read all those factors were correlated with the 
incidence of colon and rectal cancer 
the strongest risk factor we found was saturated fat in the 
diet and the american sedentary lifestyle ms whittemore said 
chineseamerican men who had four to seven times more colon or 
rectal cancer than men of the same age in the peoples republic of 
china got less exercise and were more likely to eat high quantities 
of food rich in animal or dairy fat 
the colorectal cancer rates among the chineseamerican men are 
about the same as among white american men ms whittemore said 
the cancer rates among chineseamerican women however was lower 
than among the chineseamerican men but higher than among the 
chinese women 
we were puzzled by this at first but what we found out is that 
the chineseamerican men have been here 10 years longer than the 
women on the average ms whittemore said 
they migrated earlier and didnt bring their wives over until 
they had money to support them the women havent been here long 
enough 
that finding she said showed that the duration of exposure to 
the american diet and lifestyle are important in the risk of 
colorectal cancer the longer the chinese lived in the united 
states the greater their risk of the disease 
ms whittemore said there were other impressive differences 
besides saturated fat in diets of the two countries the chinese 
tend to eat more calories every day but they burn up far more 
calories 
the calories the chinese consume are mostly carbohydrates 
mostly from rice she said the average guy over there does not 
eat like we do in a chinese restaurant here they have a hard time 
getting meat so their diet is largely carbohydrates 
ms whittemore said the chinese also eat more vegetables than 
americans and that to some degree seemed to help block the 
formation of the cancers 
vegetables appeared to be protective she said the more 
vegetables you eat the lower your risks

california voters who launched a tax revolt 
that spread across the nation a decade ago may have given up their 
tightfisted ways in a new shift of the political winds they voted 
to double their gasoline tax and raise billions of dollars for mass 
transit schools and the poor 
it really does end the tax revolt in california and sends a 
message to washington which i dislike intensely conservative 
economist arthur laffer said wednesday the day after the statewide 
spending spree 
in the late 1970s laffer helped win voter approval of the twin 
foundations of the california tax revolt proposition 13 a 1978 
property taxslashing measure and a followup government spending 
lid that passed the next year 
proposition 111 which passed by a 52to48 percent margin 
tuesday will double the states gasoline tax from 9 cents to 18 
cents over five years the tax will raise 155 billion for a 
10year freeway building and improvement program intended to slow 
the slide toward automotive gridlock 
but it also eases the spending limit initiatives that formed the 
cornerstone of the tax revolt movement reversing political 
priorities from the antitax philosophy that dominated the last 
decade 
the measure was championed by gov george deukmejian and a 
heavyweight businesslabor coalition it was extremely popular in 
freewaylaced cities but soundly rejected in the most rural regions 
supporters said the economy environment and quality of life 
were at stake in the vote last octobers earthquake which toppled 
a freeway in oakland also played a role 
i believe it clearly says if you come with a good reason to 
spend the money voters will approve and sanction what youve 
done assembly speaker willie brown said 
us secretary of transportation samuel k skinner said he was 
delighted with the vote he said it validates the bush 
adminstrations argument that voters are willing to raise taxes for 
highways and other transportation needs 
californias gas tax currently ranks 47th in the nation well 
below the national average of 158 cents a gallon if other states 
taxes were to stay the same california would rank 23rd in the 
nation after proposition 111 goes into full effect according to 
oliver yandle of the highway users federation in washington 
voters also passed two bond measures one a companion to 
proposition 111 and the other sponsored by environmentalists that 
together provide nearly 3 billion for masstransit rail 
construction throughout the state 
the ballot carried five other bond measures the most bond 
funding for a single election in california history voters approved 
them all they include 150 million to house the homeless and four 
others to provide 2 billion to build new prisons make state and 
local government buildings safer andupgrade public schools and 
universities 
altogether californians approved 15 of the 17 propositions on 
the statewide ballot rejecting only two republicansponsored 
initiatives to take reapportionment of congressional and legislative 
districts out of the hands of the democratcontrolled legislature 
other successful ballot propositions impose strict new ethical 
standards on the legislature and attempt to streamline criminal 
trial procedures and reduce potential appeals 
environmentalists scored a victory with passage of a mountain 
lion protection initiative 
in local elections san francisco voters approved a record 332 
million bond issue to help pay for repairs from last octobers 
earthquake voters in two san francisco bay area counties alameda 
and marin voted down measures to create or strengthen nuclear 
free zones 
but the multimilliondollar standout among the propositions was 
the gastax hike that california chamber of commerce president kirk 
west who helped steer the campaign called a referendum on 
californias future 
the measure expected to raise each motorists costs an average 
of 16 cents a day will supply the majority of funding for the 
largest single transportation investment in california history 
its companion measure proposition 108 will raise 1 billion 
through the sale of bonds to pay for a variety of masstransit rail 
projects including intercity amtrak service commuter lines and 
light rail systems such as those that exist in sacramento san 
diego and san francisco 
proposition 116 supported by environmentalists will raise an 
extra 199 billion by selling bonds to finance 29 masstransit 
projects virtually all will be rail improvements including about 
280 million in work affecting southern pacific which donated 
150000 to the campaign to pass the measure 
because road and rail construction has not kept pace with 
population increases california drivers now waste more than 400000 
hours a day because the average speed on urban freeways has fallen 
to about 20 mph during commute hours

offerings to the hawaiian volcano goddess 
failed to save the kalapana store and driveinn which succumbed 
wednesday to lava flowing from kilauea volcano 
owner walter yamaguchi 82 had defiantly proclaimed his store 
would remain untouched by the lava because of his special 
relationship with the volcano goddess pele 
but before dawn a lava finger extending from the flow engulfed 
the last remaining landmark in this devastated rural seaside town 
civil defense officials said 
well what can you do yamaguchi said pele she made me 
collect the insurance if no burn i dont collect 
the store was the 161st structure destroyed by lava since kilauea 
began its latest series of eruptions in january 1983 about 20 
buildings remain 
yamaguchi said he had been making traditional offerings of gin 
and ti leaves to pele every day in hopes of appeasing her 
two flows that snaked through the area last month passed within 5 
feet of his store adding to yamaguchis reputation as a volcano 
prophet 
in 1977 he correctly predicted that a flow would stop before it 
reached his store once the main public gathering in kalapana 
no other structures in the nowdeserted community were hit 
wednesday as lava continued to pour from the kupaianaha vent at a 
rate of 650000 cubic meters a day officials said 
lava flowed into the ocean near the site of the puna canoe club 
there was little movement in other areas of the flow 
the destruction of the store allows yamaguchi to travel to 
california with a clear conscience later this month for dental work 
now my worries are over he said i made plans to go the 
mainland my false teeth are no good

finnish authorities sent a jet plane to 
check on possible danger from a mysterious cloud drifting west from 
the soviet union on wednesday but the large cloud changed course 
and stayed over soviet territory 
weather analysts and radiation monitors in several nordic 
countries described the cloud as about 60 miles long and 9900 to 
16500 feet above ground they said the cloud warmer than the 
surrounding air was emitting steam or smoke 
it could have been caused by some sort of disaster or accident 
but it could also be just an ordinary large cloud said markku 
konttinen of the finnish meteorological institute 
late wednesday the finnish center for radiation and nuclear 
safety in helsinki said in a telephone recorded message it is 
apparent that the air samples already taken wont reveal the 
composition of the cloud the origins of the cloud are not 
necessarily unusual 
increased monitoring will be continued as a safety precaution 
for the time being but nothing unusual has been recorded at 
radiation monitoring point the center said 
earlier the center said safety checks to determine whether the 
cloud is radioactive have been put into force 
weatherman jouko korhonen said the cloud has all the appearance 
of a normal large cloud and its direction is southeasterly at the 
moment that would keep the cloud over the soviet union 
we wont find out about the upper layers of the cloud now 
that it is moving away korhonen said but he said air samples 
could still yield some information 
if there really was something irregular there then the lower 
layers of air which are still heading in the direction of northern 
finland are more important korhonen said 
officials in rovaniemi a military aviation center on the arctic 
circle in lapland said a finnish air force jet took samples from 
finnish airspace the samples were being sent to helsinki for 
analysis 
the officials said the plane did not encounter the cloud 
earlier weather observers cited satellite photos as showing the 
cloud was headed from the barents sea toward northern finland the 
barents sea is north and east of the kola peninsula in northwestern 
soviet union 
the finnish center for radiation and nuclear safety quoted soviet 
sources this week as reporting four nuclear power plants are 
operating on the peninsula the report was provided under an 
information agreement made after the soviet nuclear accident at 
chernobyl 
the april 26 1986 explosion at the no 4 reactor of the nuclear 
plant in the soviet ukraine was the worlds worst atomic accident 
two workers died of burns they suffered in the explosion 28 died 
shortly after the accident from radiation exposure and one died of 
a heart attack while fighting the fire 
the accident touched off angry protests from the soviets western 
neighbors because the first report came from swedish officials 
after high levels of radiation discovered there 
norwegian northern defense command spokesman geir anda said 
authorities have nothing to indicate the cloud is radioactive 
from the information i have it must have come from an area at sea 
possibly north of noveya zemlya island 
the island is north of the soviet arctic port of murmansk 
torbjorn norendal of the norwegian foreign ministry said we 
contacted the soviets about this through our embassy in moscow this 
afternoon to ask what was going on the soviets say nothing strange 
has happened in their territory 
in the soviet union olga belikova of the northwest agency quoted 
murmansk civil defense official nikolai sklyar as saying radiation 
levels in murmansk were normal and that no accidents had been 
reported at nuclear sites in the region the northwest agency is an 
independent organization based in leningrad 
interfax the soviet news agency affiliated with staterun radio 
moscow recently reported that millions of dead starfish and 
mollusks had washed ashore from the barents sea the agency quoted a 
soviet laboratory as saying radiation was not the cause

pregnant women who eat balanced diets dont 
need extra vitamins and can safely gain more weight than previously 
believed according to guidelines released wednesday by the 
institute of medicine 
the guidelines based on a review of studies on nutrition weight 
gain and pregnancy said the average woman who gains 25 to 35 pounds 
during pregnancy is more apt to produce a healthy normalweight 
baby the study said also that with few exceptions vitamins and 
other food supplements are of no value in pregnancy 
in effect said lindsay allen a professor of nutrition at the 
university of connecticut the study committee concluded that mother 
nature may know best 
women when they are not told to restrict their diet during 
pregnancy normally gain this amount of weight 25 to 35 pounds 
said ms allen who was a chairman of a study subcommittee what 
we are doing is recognizing that dietary restriction in pregnancy is 
not a good idea normal weight gain is better 
evidence that the committee reviewed is the reported experience 
of large groups of women said dr roy m pitkin a ucla 
obstetrician who chaired the study committee in a sense this 
brings health recommendations in line with what is actually 
happening 
officials in the nutritional supplement industry were uick to 
dispute the committee findings that said vitamin pills were of no 
value in pregnancy 
this outrageously antihealth report potentially dooms 
thousands of children to an early death or at best substantial 
disability due to serious birth defects jb cordaro president 
of the council for responsible nutrition a vitamin industry 
organization said in a statement this report is a recipe for 
risk and the people who prepared the report must be held accountable 
for any potential harm which may come from following their advice 
cordaro cited studies that showed some nutrients such as folic 
acid may reduce the risk of spina bifida and other neural tube 
birth defects 
ms allen said however that the committee found earlier studies 
to be inconclusive furthermore she said the amount of nutrient 
sufficient to affect birth defect rates would be consumed in a 
normal balanced diet 
weight gain in pregnancy has been a major issue in medicine since 
the 19th century when physicians believed overeating led to large 
babies and difficult labors in recent years most doctors have 
followed guidelines established in 1970 by the national research 
council that advised women to gain no more than 25 pounds during 
pregnancy 
but ms allen who gained just over 30 pounds during her own 
recent pregnancy said members of her committee studied new 
statistical data that shows women can gain more weight and have 
babies who are bigger and healthier at birth they used this new 
supporting evidence to say that weight gain should be higher than 
recommended previously 
the report said weight gain during pregnancy should be evaluated 
on an individual basis considering the womans height and body 
type tall underweight women the study said should gain between 
28 and 40 pounds during pregnancy while obese women should gain 
only about 15 pounds ms allen said this follows a weight gain 
pattern that women seen to follow naturally 
how fast pregnant women gain weight is important the committee 
said a gain of one pound a week is best during the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy for the average woman while overweight 
women should gain at half that rate 
a smooth steady weight gain usually is an indication of an 
increase in lean and fat a committee statement said sudden or 
erratic gain may indicate fluid retention a possible signal of 
toxemia or other problems 
for normal women eating balanced diets ms allen said vitamin 
pills and other food supplements are not needed and could even be 
hazardous 
we find it irresponsible to suggest that supplements are needed 
when we cant find any evidence that women taking healthy balanced 
diets will gain any benefit from them whatsoever she said 
weve done a very thorough search of the literature and the data 
are just not there to make a case that all women need the 
supplementation of nutrients 
an exception is for iron pills 
supplements of 30 milligrams of ferrous iron are recommended 
daily during the second and third trimesters for the general 
population of pregnant women the study said 
but ms allen said that even iron supplements should be used with 
caution since dosages above 30 milligrams interfere with the 
absorption of other essential nutrients and pitkin said that iron 
pills during the first trimester of pregnancy can aggravate nausea 
ms allen said an excess intake of some other nutrients such as 
vitamin a could adversely affect fetal development 
as with weight gain the use of supplements should be evaluated 
on a casebycase basis the committee said 
ms allen said added nutrients may be appropriate for women who 
do not eat a balanced diet or who are carrying more than one baby 
or for women at higher risk because of tobacco alcohol or drug 
abuse 
ironically the study was released a short time after ms allen 
and her husband became parents 
i gained 31 pounds well within the guidelines she said 
the study was organized by the national research council for the 
institute of medicine both are organizations affiliated with the 
national academy of sciences a private organization chartered by 
congress to advise on scientific issues

a top soviet trade official made it clear 
wednesday that once the ussoviet trade agreement wins final 
approval in congress his country will be looking for us loans to 
help the troubled soviet economy 
yuri n chumakov deputy minister of foreign economic relations 
said west european countries and canada already were offering such 
loans and loan guarantees to make sales in the soviet union the 
government of president mikhail gorbachev would expect the same from 
the united states he said 
the united states is our greatest food supplier we have been 
paying with cash chumakov told a gathering of us businessmen 
we have the right to expect in this hard period to receive certain 
credits in order to withstand the pressure 
chumakovs remarks referred to the turmoil facing the soviet 
economy which is plagued by food shortages sagging production and 
inflation as it attempts to move from a centrally planned system to 
one based on free markets 
the united states currently is blocked from extending loan relief 
to the soviets by the same law which keeps tariffs at high levels on 
soviet exports to this country 
the 1974 jacksonvanik provision says the soviets cannot qualify 
for the most favorable tariffs or for us government loans until a 
trade agreement is completed and the president certifies that the 
soviet union allows free emigration 
bush has said he will send the trade agreement to congress along 
with a presidential request for favored trade status once the soviet 
legislature passes an emigration measure now expected this fall 
under the jacksonvanik provision if congress agrees with the 
presidents recommendations it would clear the way for millions of 
dollars in credit from us agencies which promote export sales by 
american farmers and corporations 
the agencies involved include the exportimport bank which deals 
with sales of us industrial products and the commodity credit 
corporation which promotes us farm sales 
chumakovs appearance before of a group of us corporate 
officials interested in doing business in the soviet union was part 
of an orchestrated effort on the part of the soviets to attract 
western investment and technology chumakov was the leader of the 
soviet team which negotiated the new trade agreement 
asked if he thought it was realistic to be seeking additional 
loans from the west at a time when the soviets are falling behind in 
repaying loans they have already received chumakov replied one 
seeks credit not when he is welloff but when he is on hard times 
chumakov predicted gorbachevs perestroika program for reforming 
the soviet economy would succeed although he conceded we have 
already had a few mistakes in implementation these are 
inevitable 
chumakov said there was no ulterior motive in the decision by the 
supreme soviet to put off until the fall consideration of a law 
liberalizing emigration policies saying it had fallen victim to 
time constraints caused by the need to consider emergency economic 
legislation 
the delay was seen by the bush administration as a plus giving 
gorbachev more time to craft a compromise on the question of 
lithuanian independence an issue that threatens congressional 
approval of the trade pact 
chumakov called the trade agreement a critical first step to 
ending nearly 50 years of commercial cold war between the two 
nations he said it would lead to expanded opportunities in a number 
of areas including space telecommunications and aviation 
he suggested that american companies should consider a soviet 
offer to launch us commercial satellites on soviet rockets 
we have a lot of rockets free now from military applications 
he said why should we throw them away and lose money on them

the two survivors of a fourway 
democratic primary opened their runoff campaigns wednesday each 
accusing the other of being too stodgy for the new south 
teachers lobbyist paul hubbert and attorney general don 
siegelman will compete june 26 in a runoff to determine who will 
challenge republican gov guy hunt in the fall 
hunt alabamas first republican governor this century won gop 
renomination tuesday in a landslide also winning renomination 
easily was democratic us sen howell heflin who faces republican 
nominee bill cabaniss in november 
the democratic primary for governor was a fourway fight until 
hubbert and siegelman pulled away former gov fob james finished 
third and declined to endorse either of the top two candidates us 
rep ronnie flippo ran fourth and also intends to stay neutral his 
campaign treasurer said 
hubbert 54 the executive director of the alabama education 
association said he was the only progressive candidate in the race 
and questioned siegelmans ability to push through a promised state 
lottery bill 
siegelman 44 depicted hubbert as a special interest 
lobbyist who has not worked for the states best interests 
the issue in this campaign is not whether alabama should move 
into the new south of course it should said siegelman the 
issue is who is best able to lead our state into the new south 
virtually complete but unofficial returns showed hubbert with 
229589 votes or 32 percent siegelman with 179658 or 25 percent 
james with 158766 or 22 percent and flippo with 124344 or 17

the senate agriculture committee endorsed 
legislation wednesday to prohibit chemical companies from selling 
pesticides abroad that are considered too dangerous to be used here 
because the food and drug administration waives through 
virtually all imported food without inspection these chemicals 
often end up on americas dinner tables said sen patrick leahy 
dvt the committee chairman 
about 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the 
united states come from abroad 
leahy and other democrats on the panel said the bill was designed 
not only to protect consumers from health hazards associated with 
certain agricultural chemicals but to protect the american farmer 
from unfair foreign competition 
foreign farmers are able to use madeintheusa chemicals that 
our farmers cannot said leahy we effectively penalize us 
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law 
but republicans on the committee said the bill penalizes american 
chemical manufacturers by stopping them from making a product that 
foreign competitors can make and sell 
if we phase companies out it would take other companies very 
little time to gear up said sen christopher bond rmo 
the bill which passed on a voice vote will be inserted in the 
senate version of the 1990 farm bill 
the bill would also disallow imports of foods treated with 
pesticides outlawed in the united states 
sen richard lugar of indiana the ranking republican on the 
panel said he did not believe the legislation belonged in the farm 
bill and would argue his case on the floor 
congress passes a farm bill every five years to regulate 
agriculture policy both the house and senate agriculture committees 
have more work to do on their bills before the full bodies can begin 
debate

president fw de klerk is 
likely to lift the 4yearold state of emergency on thursday 
according to a report by the independent south african press 
association 
the news agency in a report wednesday that did not cite sources 
said de klerk was expected to announce his plans when he addresses 
parliament in cape town on thursday afternoon 
if de klerk ends the emergency it would remove a major obstacle 
to blackwhite negotiations on a new constitution de klerk says he 
wants the document to allow the countrys 28 million blacks to share 
power with the 5 million whites 
presidential spokesman kobie pieterse said the report by the 
south african press association was purely speculation he 
confirmed de klerk was to make a previously unannounced speech to 
parliament but declined to divulge the contents 
the african national congress and other leading antiapartheid 
groups have said the repeal of the emergency is a precondition for 
fullscale negotiations 
the emergency laws which include some of the harshest measures 
ever imposed by south africas white rulers must be renewed by 
midnight friday if they are to remain in effect 
de klerk met wednesday with his cabinet and they were expected 
to make a final decision on whether to lift or extend the emergency 
pieterse declined to discuss details of the cabinet talks 
de klerk has eased some of the emergency rules but among those 
remaining in effect are that police can detain people without charge 
indefinitely 
police also can still declare an unrest area and order all 
people including journalists to leave they can conduct searches 
and seize materials without a warrant and they cannot be prosecuted 
for their actions under the emergency if they act in good faith 
de klerk has said he wants to lift the emergency but will not do 
so until authorities are confident they can control violence that 
claimed more than 500 black lives in the first three months of this 
year 
leading newspapers and political analysts have been virtually 
unanimous in predicting the relaxation or lifting of emergency rules 
i only hope that the government will see the necessity of 
lifting the state of emergency anc leader nelson mandela said 
last week before departing on a sixweek tour of europe north 
america and africa it has been absolutely ineffective 
the wideranging emergency rules initially banned most forms of 
peaceful protest and made it illegal to call for boycotts or foreign 
sanctions to seek to undermine the security forces or to report on 
police actions or unrest without permission 
more than 30000 activists almost all of them black have been 
detained without trial for varying lengths of time during the 
emergency others went into hiding 
dozens of opposition groups were banned and several 
antiapartheid newspapers were shut down temporarily police 
repeatedly raided black trade union offices and broke up political 
meetings and demonstrations in black townships and on university 
campuses 
de klerk has nullified some of the restrictions as part of a 
series of reforms implemented since he assumed power last august he 
also has released scores of detainees and longterm political 
prisoners 
about 300 activists currently are in jail under the emergency 
regulations according to the human rights commission a private 
group 
an estimated 6000 blacks have died in the past four years most

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
wednesday that white house aide ron kaufman attended the state 
democratic convention in massachusetts as a commentator not as a 
political saboteur 
massachusetts democrats have accused kaufman of orchestrating a 
police picket that created a fourhour delay in the start of the 
convention on saturday in springfield mass kaufman denied 
involvement with the picket 
kaufman says its not true fitzwater said thats about 
all we know about it he was serving as a commentator to some media 
outlets in the boston area 
fitzwater said president bush was aware of the controversy and 
that kaufman had been questioned about the events no further white 
house inquiry was planned he said 
republicans in massachusetts are hoping to capitalize on a 
slumping economy proposed tax increases and a state budget crisis 
to capture the governors office for the first time since 1970 
democratic gov michael dukakis is not seeking reelection 
it was kaufman who arranged for bush to cruise polluted boston 
harbor as a way of attacking dukakis environmental record during 
the 1988 presidential campaign kaufman also arranged for bush to 
come to boston and accept the endorsement of the boston police 
patrolmens association 
the springfield police union which conducted the picketing last 
saturday also endorsed bush

springfield police union and party officials said they planned to 
amend the suit to include kaufman

center violated the delegates rights to gather for a political 
assembly

two major manufacturers of hair dryers have 
eliminated the danger of electrocution when their products fall into 
water the consumer product safety commission said wednesday 
the new hair dryers solve a problem which has plagued the 
industry since the early 1980s when an estimated 17 electrocutions 
annually were caused by handheld hair dryers falling into tubs and 
other water the commission said 
approximately 10 of these deaths were to children under 10 years 
of age the agency said 
the problem with this product in particular is that it is used 
in the bathroom near water said commission spokesman dan rumelt 
youve got people that are drying their hair that have just 
come out of the shower whove got wet feet hands and hair said 
dick bruno vice president of marketing for windmere corp of miami 
the nations largest hair dryer manufacturer 
we wanted to take a position of providing the technology that 
was available he added 
windmeres new guardian esp hair dryers and curling iron and 
brush incorporate the new safety feature the classics protection 
plus hair dryer made by conair corp of stamford conn also 
includes the new safety feature 
the new dryers have rectangularshaped plugs with a reset button 
at the end of the cords 
a device called an appliance leakage current interrupter is built 
into the plug this detects any change in the electric current in 
the dryer within a fraction of a second and shuts the appliance off 
consumers should look for hair dryers with this feature 
together with the certification mark of a recognized testing 
laboratory said commission chairwoman jacqueline jonessmith 
we want to encourage companies to build safety into their 
products added jonessmith 
the new products offer protection against electrocution whether 
their switches are in the on or off position 
hair dryers manufactured since oct 1 1987 need only protect 
against electrocution if they fall into water with the switch in the 
off position the new dryers meet a new voluntary safety 
standard that becomes effective jan 1 1991 
between 16 million and 20 million hair dryers are sold in the 
united states annually according to bruno 
david schmeltzer the head of the commissions compliance 
division estimated there are still some 80 million hair dryers in 
the hands of consumers that pose a danger of electrocution because 
they dont meet the 1987 standard 
despite the product improvements the commission additionally 
warned consumers that electricity and water are a potentially 
deadly combination and in their presence children should always be 
supervised

columbia will have to be returned to 
a hangar to repair a fuel leak indefinitely delaying the launch of 
the shuttle and its 15 million astro observatory nasa said 
wednesday 
the announcement came after a hydrogen leak reappeared during a 
test 
unfortunately we dont like what we found launch director 
bob sieck said its good news bad news its good that we found 
it and its unfortunate that its going to be an impact to fix it 
wednesdays test in which liquid hydrogen was pumped into 
columbia confirmed the leak in a tight cavity between two metal 
plates that connect the orbiter and external tank sieck said 
in order to fix anything in this area were going to have to 
demate the orbiter from the tank in the hangar he said we do 
know the leak is temperaturedependent which is going to make it 
difficult to pin down once we do get access to this area 
sieck declined to estimate when columbia might be able to lift 
off officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
have said it will take about a month to return the shuttle to the 
hangar and perform repairs 
columbias move will take place sometime next week he said 
preparations for atlantis secret military flight in july would 
continue as planned he added 
shuttles have been moved from the launch pad back to the hangar 
twice because of mechanical failures and another time because of 
payload problems 
about 6 percent of columbias external tank was filled for 
wednesdays test with liquid hydrogen chilled to minus 420 degrees 
as the fuel flowed through the orbiter into the external fuel tank 
sensors detected buildups of hydrogen in the aft engine compartment 
and between the two metal plates 
the exact location and nature of the leak were not immediately 
known sieck said further checks were planned at the launch pad 
we think what were going to find in this when we finally nail 
this down is its going to be something in the hardware that reacted 
to the cryogenic extremely cold conditions he said its 
going to be a unique thing its going to be one of these new 
things that pop up in a complex system 
the suspected area from the start has been a 17inchdiameter 
valve in a pipe that runs through both plates tests with helium at 
room temperature last week were unsuccessful 
the external tank was drained following the 2hour test 
last weeks launch attempt was scrubbed when the leak was 
discovered as columbia was being loaded with more than a 
halfmillion gallons of combustible liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen the mission already was two weeks late because of cooling 
system repairs 
the astro mission is one of six remaining shuttle flights 
scheduled for 1990 it appears likely one of the missions will be 
pushed into next year as a result of columbias problems

republican gov terry branstad and his 
newly annoited democratic challenger don avenson opened their 
general election contest wednesday with a preview of what could 
become a nasty fight over abortion 
branstad immediately dismissed avensons campaign supported 
strongly by abortion rights advocates as a typical 
specialinterest effort similar to ones run by democrats he has 
beaten in the past 
and avenson the speaker of the iowa house joined his vanquished 
democratic rivals in vowing to oust branstad 
the winds of change are blowing in iowa and terry branstad 
better start watching the want ads avenson said its our 
turn 
avensons win was solid if not lopsided in a record turnout of 
about 200000 voters his primary campaign had a solid core of 
backing from unions teachers and feminists 
you have nominated yourself a tiger a tiger for the ordinary 
people avenson told cheering supporters as he claimed victory 
avenson built an 7 percent edge over attorney general tom miller 
but former banker john chrystal also fared well cutting into 
avensons prochoice support 
with all of the states 2567 precincts reporting avenson had 
78783 votes or 39 percent to 63154 or 32 percent for attorney 
general tom miller and 52039 or 26 percent for former banker john 
chrystal 
abortion was the major issue in the democratic campaign both 
avenson and chrystal supported a womans right to an abortion but 
abortion rights groups endorsed avenson and poured strong support 
into his campaign miller opposes abortion 
i think the fact that we offered iowans a choice made the 
difference avenson said

sen max baucus and his democratic 
supporters say theyre bracing for an avalanche of republican cash 
in this falls general election battle with lt gov allen kolstad 
but baucus a twoterm democrat who was nominated for reelection 
tuesday has his own pile of campaign cash which republicans are 
trying to turn into a liability rather than an asset 
senator baucus will learn the hard way that montana cannot be 
bought with an outofstate war chest said montana gop chairman 
barbara campbell does he need 2 million to get reelected to a 
job hes held for 12 years that says hes very weak 
baucus coasted past two primary opponents tuesday with 83 percent 
of the democratic vote while kolstad won a fourman race with 43 
percent of the gop vote 
kolstad and the republicans are hoping for a repeat of 1988 when 
upstart republican conrad burns pulled off an upset victory over 
twoterm incumbent democratic sen john melcher 
kolstad promised wednesday to run an aboveboard campaign 
focusing on economic issues and refraining from personal attacks 
but democratic party chairman bruce nelson said he expects kolstad 
to go on the offensive against baucus 
the pattern that republicans set two years ago of a relentless 
negative attack is the same thing that they will do this year he 
predicted 
baucus already has raised more than 2 million in campaign funds 
smashing the state campaignspending record of 12 million set by 
melcher in 1988

the justice department said wednesday it 
opposes a house plan backed by some federal judges to give death row 
inmates more appeal rights than they now have 
the department said also that it had technical problems with 
a senateadopted amendment to shorten death penalty delays by 
replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal 
court review 
defendants sentenced to death sometimes use habeas corpus 
hearings in attempts to win new trials or sentences the senate 
amendment was defeated then passed 12 hours later on may 24 as part 
of a comprehensive anticrime bill 
the house and senate proposals are among several under 
consideration in congress to speed up death penalty appeals while 
ensuring defendants rights 
deputy assistant attorney general paul l maloney told a house 
judiciary subcommittee that the house plan would cause delays and 
repetition in appeals and that the senate proposal contained 
defects 
the house plan is sponsored by rep paul kastenmeier dwis 
chairman of the judiciary committees subcommittee on courts it 
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that 
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards 
the bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple 
prisoner petitions and establishing a oneyear limit for inmates to 
file for federal habeas relief 
but maloney said the measure multiplies the opportunity for 
delay and abuse in capital cases 
he quoted retired supreme court justice lewis f powell who said 
recently that a vote for kastenmeiers bill would in practical 
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the united 
states 
the bill was backed during thursdays hearing by joseph lowery 
president of the southern christian leadership conference he said a 
broader supervisory role by the federal judiciary was needed to stop 
the inexhaustible litany of racial discrimination cases in the 
courts in the rural south 
the bill also has the support of several federal judges 
including gilbert merritt of nashville tenn chief judge of the 
6th us circuit court of appeals 
maloney said also that the department was not ready to support 
the amendment requiring the filing of habeas corpus petitions within 
60 days after final action by state courts the amendment was 
authored by sens arlen specter rpa and strom thurmond rsc 
the specterthurmond amendment raises interesting 
possibilities for reducing appeals delays through a stronger 
more comprehensive system of time limitation rules maloney said 
but he added we do find that there are some defects some 
technical problems if you will under questioning he said the 
amendment was still under review and he was not prepared to specify 
what the problems were

a new policy halting the explusion of some 
palestinians in the occupied lands affects thousands who have been 
separated from their families a civil rights group said wednesday 
under the government decision announced tuesday wives and 
children of palestinians who live in west bank or gaza strip without 
residency permits would be allowed to live in the occupied 
territories unless there is a specific negative security reason 
to deny the request 
the decision came after israels association for civil rights 
appealed the expulsions of 15 palestinians and after us criticism 
that expelling women and children without such permits was dividing 
arab families 
the new regulations say arabs in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip will be allowed to ask for residency status for members of 
their families who can remain as visitors 
netta goldman a lawyer with the association for civil rights 
said the group also won a court order specifying that as visitors 
wives and children would be entitled to normal health benefits and 
schooling 
this affects thousands and thousands of people she said 
under past regulations only palestinians who lived in the 
occupied lands during a september 1967 census were automatically 
eligible for residency permits 
that did not include thousands of palestinian women whose 
families fled to jordan when israel seized the west bank and gaza in 
the june 1967 mideast war and who later married men from the 
occupied areas 
wives and children denied residency permits would enter the 
occupied lands on threemonth guest visas then had to abandon their 
families and return to jordan for several months or stay illegally 
according to the army 251 palestinians including 88 women and 
78 children were expelled from the territories last year because 
they lacked residency permits the army has no figures for preceding 
years 
in january the us state department questioned the expulsion 
practices defense minister yitzhak rabin immediately ordered a 
temporary halt to the practice and promised to review it 
according to rabin 88249 requests for family reunification have 
been received since 1967 and 13509 of those were granted 
palestinians activists have claimed the expulsions were part of a 
strategy to force palestinians out of the occupied lands but 
israeli officials denied this 
still the issue has been seen as part of a demographic war with 
some palestinians trying to increase their numbers in the 
territories while israel tried to limit the growth about 17 
million arabs and 70000 jews live in the occupied lands 
palestinian activist and lawyer jonathan kuttab said wednesday 
the new rules were a positive thing but would still leave tens 
of thousands of palestinians as exiles 
he said the decision was an attempt to reduce the damage from 
the glaring discrimination of allowing total strangers like 
soviet jews to come here while denying the basic rights of 
palestinians who have family and roots here to come back to their 
land

jesse jackson urged mayor marion barry on 
wednesday to work out a plea bargain in his drug and perjury case 
and declare he wont run for reelection 
the city should be spared a racially divisive trial and 
campaign jackson said 
he made his comments as barry lawyer r kenneth mundy disclosed 
he had talked with jackson about the mayors criminal trial the 
case went through a third day of jury selection with 16 prospective 
jurors sent into a jury pool that now numbers 25 
talk of a possible plea bargain dominated public discussion of 
the trial as various figures hinted they were involved or declared 
they werent 
walter fauntroy washingtons delegate in congress and a 
candidate to succeed barry as mayor called a news conference to 
remind reporters he had earlier appealed to barry and prosecutors to 
spare the city and the nation the agony of a trial and to say he 
had concluded that appeal has not fallen on deaf ears 
at the white house however presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said there was no basis to a report that jackson 
fauntroy and other democrats had called administration officials 
asking them to encourage prosecutors to soften terms for a guilty 
plea 
mundy said i have spoken to reverend jackson but he shed no 
light on the question of a possible role for jackson in any plea 
bargain negotiations with the government 
no discussions on a possible guilty plea were under way mundy 
said he declined to answer whether that subject had come up in the 
conversation with jackson asked whether he would rule out such 
talks with the prosecution mundy said he never says anything in 
absolutes 
various reports have indicated that negotiations between mundy 
and the us attorneys office in washington reached an impasse 
several days ago over the governments insistence that the mayor 
plead guilty to one of the three felony perjury counts against him 
barry also faces 10 misdemeanor charges of drug possession and 
one of conspiracy 
jackson moved to washington last year amid speculation he had his 
eye on the mayors office but he has since said he will not be a 
candidate in the november election barry has not formally announced 
for a fourth fouryear term but had made numerous campaignstyle 
appearances and aides say he is likely to run 
in an interview on wusatv jackson expressed hope that the mayor 
would determine he would not run again and would really 
challenge the justice department to work out some settlement 
process 
theres enough pain to go around he said 
if all this laundry comes out in a trial it will be a long 
and ugly and national and divisive campaign jackson said 
we should be spared all of this he added it is very 
republicandemocrat its very whiteblack its very nasty 
settling the case now would allow rebuilding a lot of fractures 
and wounds in this city thats now pouring over into the entire 
country said jackson 
jackson said a trial would embarrass the justice department 
considering the amount of time and money spent by the government 
in pursuing barry and the horror stories we now hear about the 
fbis role the bureaus sting operation resulted in a videotape 
of barry allegedly smoking crack cocaine and is the centerpiece of 
the governments case 
they used more than the amount of money that they would spend 
on a serial killer or an sampl thief that threatens to bankrupt the 
whole country said jackson 
jackson said his sense is that barry feels if it goes the 
complete judicial process that he will emerge with some strength and 
a public airing of it but he would rather spare the people of this 
long drawnout process as well as his family 
my sense is that he would choose publicly not to run again 
that he would be interested in serving out his term and obviously 
not going to jail and continuing his recovery process 
barry spent seven weeks in substance abuse recovery centers 
following his jan 18 arrest at the vista hotel 
on tuesday nine prospective jurors were sent into a pool from 
which a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be selected for 
the barry case 
among the 16 sent into the pool wednesday was a man who expressed 
concern that his name would become known and that he might be 
subject to threats if he sat on the barry jury

the hotselling 2 live crew rap 
album as nasty as they wanna be was declared obscene wednesday 
by a federal judge who cited its graphic sexual lyrics 
us district judge jose gonzalez agreed with the broward county 
sheriffs department that the album violates community obscenity 
standards 
it is an appeal to dirty thoughts and the loins not to the 
intellect and the mind gonzalez wrote in his opinion which was 
read to a packed courtroom that included the rap groups members 
the miamibased group sued after deputies threatened shopkeepers 
with arrest if they continued selling the album 
the groups attorney bruce rogow said hed appeal the ruling 
but predicted album sales which are approaching 2 million would 
get a boost from the decision 
i think the demand for the record is going to be 
extraordinary rogow said quoting a newspaper columnist who 
wrote people will crawl naked over broken glass to get what 
someone tells them theyre not supposed to 
gonzalez said the recording met the 1973 us supreme court test 
for obscenity as set by local community standards and cited state 
laws in his ruling 
florida has declared obscenity a crime he wrote to 
repeat violation of the law against obscenity is as much against 
the law as assault rape kidnapping robbery or any other form of 
behavior which the legislature has declared criminal 
the judge who listened to the album at a hearing in midmay and 
heard arguments from witnesses and attorneys did rebuke the 
sheriffs office for improper prior restraint of free speech he 
said deputies shouldnt have approached retailers until the material 
had been declared obscene 
sheriff nick navarro said his department hasnt made any arrests 
for selling the album which has virtually disappeared from stores 
countywide 
we will enforce the laws navarro said i intend to follow 
a very prudent and reasonable line 
2 live crews leader luther campbell said the obscenity ruling 
wouldnt change the groups musical style or lyrics 
well keep making the same music we probably wont sell no 
records in broward county he said outside the courthouse 
during the may hearing rogow played the double album for the 
judge and a packed courtroom he also showed xrated videotapes and 
displayed pornographic magazines obtained locally as evidence of the 
communitys standards 
two music critics and a sociologist appeared as expert witnesses 
testifying about the recordings artistic political and literary

us immigration investigators say they expect 
manuel noriega to be charged with being at the center of the largest 
aliensmuggling ring ever uncovered 
tens of thousands of chinese cubans and other immigrants paid 
millions of dollars to panamanian officials to use that nation as an 
illegal gateway to the united states and canada said robert harris 
chief criminal investigator for the immigration and naturalization 
service here 
the ring started as early as 1980 and about 4000 cubans used it 
to enter this country at miami international airport alone during 
the past seven years authorities said sixteen thousand people were 
caught in the pipeline when the united states invaded panama in 
december said robert penland who recently retired as assistant ins 
commissioner for antismuggling 
nobody ever operated an aliensmuggling operation to the extent 
of panama harris said it was operated by the government and 
it was a wellorganized wellrun operation 
he said immigration officials could not recall any such 
stateoperated alien trade 
there is already enough evidence to seek indictments harris 
said but ins and federal prosecutors decided to move cautiously 
because of the former panamanian dictators protracted 
drugsmuggling case due to go to trial next year 
we dont want to interfere with the current prosecution effort 
by the united states attorney he said recently any indictment 
could be after the trial 
in response to harris comments us attorney dexter lehtinen 
issued a statement wednesday saying there is no indictment 
currently planned or contemplated against general manuel a noriega 
in this district that includes any allegations of alien smuggling 
the allegations became public during a january bond hearing for a 
noriega codefendant pilot eduardo pardo when federal prosecutors 
said noriega and pardo helped smuggle aliens into the country 
noriega attorney frank rubino said he was surprised by the 
investigation and questioned the us right to prosecute his client 
in such a case 
the united states may like to police the world but theyve 
just gone a step too far rubino said what may have occurred 
internally in the country of panama is not within us 
jurisdiction 
the smuggling operation not only involved noriega and top 
intelligence officials but also panamas consulates the cuban 
government private attorneys and usbased smugglers 
investigators say 
panamanian officials acting directly or through private attorney 
middlemen charged from 10000 up to 20000 for visas into panama 
harris said he said the highest prices were paid by refugees from 
china while those from cuba hong kong and other points paid 
somewhat less harris said 
cuban officials worked with noriega on the visas to extract money 
from refugees leaving that island for panama and miamibased cuban 
rights groups also paid noriega to ensure their countrymen were 
cleared to travel to the united states harris said 
trusted noriega inlaws were put in charge of two of the most 
lucrative consulates taiwan and hong kong said the investigator 
all visa approvals had to come directly from the head of panamas 
intelligence service lt col rafael cedeno or from noriega 
himself harris said cedeno distributed a list to panamanian 
customs officials and no one could enter the country unless they 
were on it harris said 
entering panama was only the beginning however harris said 
once they arrived they were further exploited they would sell 
them residence visas extensions of stay sometimes 3000 to stay 
an extra year 
maj felipe camargo who headed panamas immigration agency for 
only four months was captured after the us invasion and is one of 
several former top officials to give details on how lucrative the 
ring was said harris 
in that four months he admitted personally getting 300000 
said harris if he got 300000 the higherups must have gotten 
at least that amount 
all orders came directly from noriega and cedeno at the 
panamanian defense forces headquarters the comandancia 
and the money was then passed on to the comandancia said 
harris that would be noriega or cedeno or cedenos 
predecessor guillermo wong before the october coup attempt 
after the invasion the panamanians apparently tried to destroy 
all financial records but investigators found one set of wire 
transfers to cedeno for 80000 they believe are linked to the 
aliensmuggling 
even when the aliens made arrangments to sneak into the united 
states they still had to pay panamanian officials to get on 
cedenos exit list said harris 
smuggling into the united states from panama was accomplished in 
various forms said harris while cubans could simply show up in the 
united states and claim political asylum chinese aliens had more 
difficulty 
they take a different route they try to evade the ins through 
fraudulent documents or cross over land borders he said 
as far as the ins can tell the new government of panama has 
stopped the alien trade into the country officials said 
but about 7000 chinese were stranded in panama after the 
invasion so the smuggling operations out of that country continue 
even though no longer organized by the government immigration 
officials said the 8000 others were either in the home countries 
in third countries or were still making their way into the united 
states officials said 
a flight of illegal chinese immigrants from panama was recently 
intercepted in canada and harris said arrests are still being made 
in miami

sure supermans super but hes short 
even puny 
thats the feeling of some metropolis residents who express 
concern that a 7foot5 statue of the man of steel is dwarfed by a 
supermarkets 32foot statue of a burly lumberjack 
as the ohio river city of 7200 begins its fourday annual 
superman celebration on thursday a move is afoot to replace the 
superman replica with a 15foot version 
i took a good long look at it one day and i decided we needed 
a new superman said od troutman one of six people on a 
committee organized to acquire a new statue we just want to get a 
larger one a better looking one and one that is better 
proportionally built 
the current superhero was built for 1000 four years ago but 
his stature now seems downright diminutive compared to big john the 
statue of a lumberjack that stands at the entrance to big johns 
supermarket a few blocks from supermans lowly brick pedestal in 
front of the courthouse 
though he says bigger is better troutman isnt ready to top big 
john it would be higher than the courthouse and it wouldnt blend 
in with the surroundings 
besides a superman the size of big john would thwart 
cameratoting tourists trying to snap a few photos of the kids 
clambering on the man of steel 
residents would readily contribute toward a new statue troutman 
said explaining ive had folks tell me if you get rid of the 
statue we will give you 100 for a new one 
a new steelandfiberglass model could be built within three 
months and have a grand unveiling at the 1991 superman celebration 
he said 
the celebration has been held annually since 1979 and is expected 
to draw more than the 20000 visitors it attracted last year said 
jenny walters celebration committee chairwoman 
metropolis the name of supermans fictional hometown adopted 
him in 1972 and the celebration honoring him with skits picnics 
and other familyoriented events gets bigger every year so a larger 
superman is a good move walters said 
but what about the old superman 
it would look good on top of our 150foot water tower 
troutman said

a private project to improve rural 
americans cardiovascular health resulted in an average ninepound 
loss of body fat as well as reduced cholesterol and blood pressure 
organizers said wednesday 
were talking about an impressive improvement in the quality of 
life about people being more productive and less stressed said 
bill reger director of bayer cos 33 million twoyear study 
our success has been phenomenal 
participants were encouraged to follow a lowfat highfiber 
diet to exercise and to use stress management techniques 
free cooking and aerobics classes were offered along with 
lectures on heart disease nutrition and weight loss stopsmoking 
clinics also were available 
those in the study which began in may 1988 had their blood 
pressures cholesterol pulse rates and other factors checked every 
three months 
the programs final screenings were completed late last month 
results from that screening will be distributed to the participants 
beginning thursday 
the program one of the first privately funded public health 
education programs for rural areas was sponsored by bayer and its 
new yorkbased parent company glenbrook laboratories 
organizers chose wellsburg a town of about 4000 people about 
45 miles southwest of pittsburgh because of its small population 
the 517 people who went through the program from start to finish 
lost an average of 86 pounds of body fat reger said an average 
52 pounds of that fat was converted to muscle tissue resulting in 
an average weight loss of 36 pounds 
the participants also saw their cholesterol reduced from an 
average reading of 220 at the start of the study to 208 
the reduction may not seem to be that much at first blush 
said reger but if you look further the people at the most risk 
were the ones who made the greatest positive changes and were 
thrilled with that 
average blood pressures of those in the study dropped from an 
average 132 over 81 to 126 over 78 
again the changes may appear modest but the people at most 
risk had the biggest reductions said reger overall people in 
the program are using far fewer high blood pressure medications now 
than they were two years ago 
west virginia has one of the highest obesity rates in the country 
at 29 percent according to a 1988 report by the federal centers for 
disease control the same study found that 27 percent of west 
virginians smoked 
nearly everyone in the study reported reducing their salt and fat 
intake and 57 percent of those who smoked when they started the 
program have quit reger said

the bush administration moved wednesday to 
defuse controversy over government financing of potentially 
objectional art by proposing a oneyear interim extension of the 
national endowment for the arts 
endowment director john e frohnmayer told a senate panel he 
hoped time would allow the temperature to go down on the dispute 
over federal aid of allegedly obscene art 
he urged that a 12member advisory commission half of it 
appointed by congress and half by the white house be given time to 
reach some recommendations about the future of the endowment and its 
grantmaking procedures 
this problem must be solved and i pledge to you my full 
attention to it frohnmayer said this controversy has been 
debilitating to my agency 
frohnmayer appeared before a senate appropriations subcommittee 
considering the budget for the nea the agencys legislative 
authorization is scheduled to expire at the end of this fiscal year 
president bush has recommended another fiveyear renewal or 
reauthorization of the nea with no restrictions on its grantmaking 
authority but the nea has drawn opposition among conservatives 
because of federal grants for controversial works by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and photographer andrews serrano 
and congressional supporters have acknowledged it would be difficult 
to win full renewal with no restrictions 
frohnmayer told the panel that the bush administration continues 
to prefer a fiveyear reauthorization of the nea without 
restrictions but would accept a threeyear or even a oneyear 
extension while awaiting the commissions recommendation 
at the white house deputy press secretary alixe glen called a 
oneyear extension the prudent thing to do 
given the political climate this isnt something we want to do 
hastily she said 
the advisory commission met separately wednesday for the first 
time to review the agencys grantmaking procedures its first 
meeting came more than a month after it had been directed by 
congress to make a report on the nea frohnmayer cited 
administrative delays and urged that the commissions life also be 
extended beyond its october expiration 
frohnmayer received a lecture from the subcommittee chairman 
sen robert c byrd dwva and sen james a mcclure ridaho 
about the peril posed to the endowment by the controversial grants 
byrd said some of the subsidized works of art were so 
repulsive that if viewed by the general public there would by a 
far greater outcry that could force an end to the nea altogether 
its too bad that a few little rotten apples will spoil the 
barrel but they surely will byrd said 
mcclure said he wanted to continue supporting the arts but 
complained of an attitude out there among the arts community 
that congress has no business exercising control on grants 
frohnmayer acknowledged the controversy has damaged the nea and 
said the endowment has taken steps to ensure grants go through 
careful review 
i would hope we could put mapplethorpe and serrano behind us 
because we have really bloodied ourselves he said 
mapplethorpes works included homoerotic photographs and 
serranos works included a depiction of a crucifix in urine 
the oneyear plan was decided upon at a meeting tuesday including 
white house officials and frohnmayer as a way to head off further 
restrictions on nea

several senators moved wednesday to end us 
talks with the palestine liberation organization because of the 
groups involvement in a foiled terrorist attack on israel 
the terrorist raid on israel last week was the last straw in a 
continuing pattern of unacceptable behavior by the plo said sen 
joseph lieberman dconn 
abu abbas a member of the plos executive committee claimed 
responsibility for the foiled boat attack against civilians on a 
beach in tel aviv 
lieberman and three others senators iowa republican charles 
grassley and democrats connie mack of florida and frank lautenberg 
of new jersey introduced a resolution that would force the state 
department to end talks with the plo until it renounces terrorism 
and recognizes israels right to exist 
lisa klinghoffer daughter of terrorist victim leon klinghoffer 
said a cold chill ran down my spine when she saw abu abbas on 
television recently 
abbas was convicted in absentia by the italian government of 
directing the terrorist takeover of the cruise ship achille lauro in 
the mediterranean in 1985 klinghoffer confined to a wheelchair 
was shot and killed his body dumped overboard 
the state department in a report released earlier this year 
said there was no evidence that plo officials directed terrorism 
even though there were scattered incidents of violence 
under existing law the united states cant deal with the plo if 
it endorses terrorism 
us officials have said they are reviewing last weeks attempted 
boat attack

a federal court ruling that the county board 
of supervisors drew district boundaries to dilute hispanic voting 
strength will be appealed 
us district judge david kenyon ruled monday in a voting rights 
lawsuit that board members conspired to protect their incumbencies 
and those of their allies when they redrew the countys five 
voting districts in 1981 
the boards conservative majority voted tuesday to appeal the 
twoyear legal battle over redistricting already has cost 3 million 
liberal supervisors dissented regarding the appeal and called for 
a settlement that would expand the fivemember board to offer more 
representation 
its time for at least nine supervisors supervisor kenneth 
hahn said 
hahn left before the closeddoor vote and fellow liberal ed 
edelman abstained 
conservative pete schabarum who is retiring favored the appeal 
as did mike antonovich and deane dana 
the 1988 lawsuit claimed the supervisors deliberately spread the 
countys hispanic population across several districts when they 
changed voting boundaries following the 1980 federal census 
hispanics make up an estimated 35 percent of the countys 87 
million people but no hispanic has been elected to the board since 
1875

defense secretary dick cheney joined white 
housecongressional talks wednesday but offered no indication the 
bush administration was ready to accept significant defense cuts 
participants said 
cheney entered the negotiations amid differences over how the 
talks might be affected by tuesdays vote in california to double 
that states gasoline tax democrats said it signaled that americans 
dont necessarily reject higher levies but most republicans 
discounted the notion that the california vote would make budget 
negotiators less fearful of boosting federal taxes 
most democrats and some republicans see the defense department 
budget as a source of big savings next year budget negotiators are 
trying to find a way to reduce next years deficit to 64 billion 
the target set by the grammrudman law however the administration 
has said the deficit could reach as high as 206 billion without 
special attention 
president bush has proposed spending 3033 billion on the 
military for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 opponents say that 
recommendation ignores warming eastwest relations and want to cut 
it by at least 8 billion 
no new numbers cheney said during a break when asked whether 
he had offered a new defense proposal 
the defense secretary joined by republicans instead justified 
the administrations spending request which calls for slight 
decreases in future years 
democrats said they were disappointed 
the administration appears to be holding strong to the position 
that defense should not be cut said senate budget committee 
chairman james sasser dtenn if we indeed are in a crisis 
situation with regard to the federal budget then defense is 
going to have to take its fair share of reductions 
cheney and lawmakers agreed to examine how much money could be 
saved by reducing military forces by onequarter an option the 
secretary said was already under study at the pentagon negotiators 
said this would allow the two sides to work from common figures and 
was not an indication of a final agreement 
while defense was the topic of the negotiations many lawmakers 
were mulling the 53 to 47 percent margin by which californians voted 
to double their gasoline tax to 18 cents the money is to be used to 
improve highways 
its an indication that the tax revolt has been tempered by 
a realization that we have to make investments in the country 
said house speaker thomas s foley dwash 
this confirms what the polls have been saying that people are 
willing to pay additional taxes if they know they are going for a 
specific purpose said house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif 
panetta and sasser agreed that on the other hand raising local 
taxes could make people more resentful of federal tax increases 
this does make it more difficult for people to accept higher 
federal taxes on top of it sasser said 
most republicans said the california vote would not affect the 
budget talks 
california is a state unto itself said rep bill archer of 
texas ranking republican on the taxwriting house ways and means 
committee thats not relevant to what were doing here 
house minority leader bob michel rill said it has always been 
difficult for congress to enact excise taxes on products such as 
gasoline but he said the california voting represents some little 
change of heart at least on the part of californians 
meanwhile house republicans and democrats skirmished over plans 
by democrats to immediately begin writing spending bills for next 
year 
gop lawmakers complained that the spending measures would be 
overly expensive unless budget bargainers were first given a chance 
to work out a deficitreduction deal they urged house leaders to 
set june 28 as a deadline for completing the budget talks 
democrats said work on the spending bills must begin now with the 
new fiscal year less than four months away

the government rounded up at least 
seven former communist party leaders wednesday in a move likely to 
hurt the chances of communist candidates two days before the 
nations first free election since 1946 
the party is running a distant third in opinion polls 
detained was vasil bilak the former party official thought to 
have invited in the soviet troops who crushed the prague spring 
reform movement of alexander dubcek in 1968 at least six other 
former senior communists were questioned 
in another political development josef bartoncik a major 
christian democratic politician accused of having been a secret 
police informer was denounced by the minister charged with 
investigating past secret police operations and urged to quit 
politics 
wednesdays developments seemed likely to benefit the civic forum 
movement of president vaclav havel already favored to win fridays 
elections the christian democrats are running second in the surveys 
rumors consistently cited bilak as the man who encouraged the 
soviets to invade in 1968 
the state news agency ctk said bilak was held on suspicion of 
committing serious criminal activity 
prominent communists questioned wednesday included former 
president and party chief gustav husak milos jakes the party chief 
ousted in last winters prodemocracy revolution and former premier

members and the imposition of orthodox communist rule after the 1968 
invasion 
former slovak communist official peter colotka was also 
questioned said an informed source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
all with the exception of husak spent the day at local police 
stations husak 76 is frail and was questioned at home 
deputy interior minister andrej samel said the questioning dealt 
with the 1968 invasion and other criminal activities 
state television news said it also touched on illegal 
acquisitions of property and mismanagement of hard currency accounts 
the move appeared timed to satisfy popular demand that bilak 
jakes and others be punished for their part in the invasion and the 
21 years of tough communist rule that followed 
communists excluded all parties contesting the parliamentary 
election on friday and saturday have campaigned heavily on an 
anticommunist platform 
in the past few weeks state television has repeatedly broadcast 
film of the invasion and other episodes associated with the hated 
communist rule the horrors of which also are chronicled in a 
recently opened exhibit 
bilak 72 a former chief communist ideologue was picked up at 
his home in the slovak capital of bratislava at midnight tuesday 
samel said 
he will be held for 48 hours state television said 
one of the other officials summoned for questioning was rudolf 
hegenbart formerly in charge of security for the communist party 
and identified last week in a british broadcasting corp documentary 
as the man who allegedly conspired with the soviet kgb to oust jakes 
the names of the others interrogated were not immediately 
available 
last april czechoslovak prosecutors began investigating the 1968 
warsaw pact invasion which they termed a criminal offense against 
peace deputy prosecutor general lubomir veleta said then the 
inquiry was intended to find all those responsible 
an offense against peace carries a maximum sentence of 15 
years in jail and does not fall under czechoslovakias 20year 
statute of limitations 
the investigation has been stymied to date by soviet refusal to 
hand over all documents connected with the invasion prague is 
particularly interested in a letter allegedly chronicling bilaks 
invitation to the soviets to intervene 
in a recent interview with the youth daily mlada fronta bilak 
denied writing such a letter 
in a statement on tv news deputy interior minister jan ruml 
accused bartoncik of breaking his word after promising tuesday to 
quit politics 
bartoncik is chairman of the peoples party which is in the 
mainstream christian democratic movement 
bartoncik repeatedly denied being a secret police informer but 
made the pledge after being confronted with what ruml termed facts 
that made bartoncik unfit to be a parliamentary deputy 
bartonciks party said he was hospitalized tuesday after reported 
cardiac arrest 
ruml accused bartoncik of trying to hide his past and said he 
felt compelled to speak out which may prompt more revelations about 
leading politicians who once cooperated with the stb the now 
disbanded secret police 
civic forum spokeswoman jana ryslinkova said wednesday some forum 
candidates had resigned after being screened for past links with the 
communist secret police 
she said she would not identify them because there were an 
estimated 140000 collaborators with the stb and it would be unfair 
to publish the names of some agents and omit others 
lets give them a chance to live but not to represent the 
civic forum she said

to go through in the formal prenotice period during which the 
proposed arms sales were made known to members of congress no 
objections were raised by lawmakers 
the sales help fulfill saudi arabias defense needs and support 
us strategic interests in the region the pentagon said 
the sales also help boost us weapons producers many of whom 
face the prospect of sharp reductions in us defense spending 
for the most part the saudis military arsenal is usmade 
though the desert kingdom concluded a 30 billion multiyear deal 
with british companies several years ago for fighter planes and 
other weapons 
this sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national 
security of the united states by helping improve the security of a 
friendly country which has been and continues to be an important 
force for political stability and economic progress in the middle 
east the pentagon said 
the largest of three separate packages announced by the defense 
department carries a 34 billion price tag and is destined to 
support the saudi national guard the pentagon said

cannon and a machine gun it is used by the us marines primarily 
as a reconnaisance vehicle as a troop carrier or as a 
lightarmored command and control center 
the other two packages include 
a 600 million modification and system integration program 
for five awacs airborne warning and control system surveillance 
aircraft and eight ke3 tanker aircraft to improve their mission 
navigation engine and aircraft protection systems the pentagon 
said 
the pentagon said the systems were necessary for a common 
configuration with similar us aircraft and to provide saudi 
arabia with an effective air defense command and control network 
capable of countering all potential threats in the persian gulf 
region 
the awacs were the subject of a bruising battle in congress in 
1981 over the introduction of such sophisticated aircraft into the 
volatile mideast region 
a 26 million sale of 12 m88a1 recovery vehicles with 
additional weapons and equipment including 12 m2 50caliber 
machine guns spare and repair parts 
the sale augments and earlier sale of nine such vehicles which 
are heavily armored and designed to tow damaged tanks or other 
tracked vehicles from the battlefield

boeing aircraft co of seattle 
the prime contractor for the lav sale is general motors of

eight greenpeace protesters dangled from the 
205foothigh astoria bridge on wednesday in a futile effort to 
block the battleship uss new jersey from entering the columbia river 
the protesters hung about 50 feet below the 4milelong bridge 
and unfurled banners that read nuclear free seas 
the 887foot battleship waited offshore to enter the river as 
authorities tried unsuccessfully to dislodge the protesters 
the activists raised themselves on ropes when a freighter 
approached said state police detective mike schacher they remained 
high enough to clear the ship when the new jersey came through later 
and a couple of them went up a little higher he said 
greenpeace spokeswoman cynthia rust said the protest was to 
prevent the uss new jersey from endangering the health and safety 
of the citizens of oregon and washington by bringing nuclear 
weapons up the columbia 
she noted that voters have declared coastal clatsop county a 
nuclear free zone 
schacher said police did not plan to physically hoist the 
protesters into custody 
we can get to them but were not going to he said the 
reason for that is the safety of our people and for them 
the protesters would be arrested at such time as they either 
come down or come up schacher said he said the demonstrators had 
enough rope to lower themselves into greenpeace rafts on the river 
i think theyre just going to hang around literally 
schacher said 
ms rust said the protesters planned to raise themselves to the 
bridge one at a time but did not say when 
we feel our protest was a huge success she said our 
intention was not to endanger the vessel or endanger the climbers 
the protesters face state criminal tresspassing charges and 
federal charges of violating the 200yard safety zone around the 
ship schacher said 
greenpeace wasnt certain what kind of weapons were aboard the 
new jersey the navy has a policy of not commenting on whether its 
vessels are carrying nuclear arms 
the new jersey is renowned for its 16inch guns each of which is 
capable of delivering nearly a ton of high explosives at a rate of 
one shell every 30 seconds 
firing of the guns and those aboard the three other iowaclass 
battleships has been suspended pending investigation of an april 19 
1989 explosion on the uss iowa that killed 47 
the new jersey was en route to portland where it planned to join 
30 other ships that traditionally tie up at the waterfront for the 
rose festival

china freed 97 prodemocracy protesters including 
two student leaders after the anniversary of the june 4 army attack 
on last years demonstrations passed without major unrest officials 
said wednesday 
the releases bring to 881 the number freed the past six months 
out of thousands arrested 
but new arrests have been reported as recently as last week and 
the releases did not signal a softening by the aging leadership 
the leaders still maintain last springs massive protests for 
democratic reform and an end to corruption were part of a coup 
attempt and that westernstyle democracy is inappropriate for china 
rather the leaders appeared to be trying to put the protests 
behind them and improve their image at home and abroad chinas 
mostfavorednation trade status remains under review in the us 
congress and foreign tourism and investment far below their 
prejune 1989 level 
there still was no word on the fate of three participants in last 
years movement who dropped out of sight last week as they planned 
to issue an open letter to the leadership calling for the release of 
jailed protesters 
the three had been the only chinese to continue speaking openly 
for democratic reform 
two of the three gao xin and zhou duo were jailed after the 
june crackdown and released in december and may respectively the 
third was wellknown folk singer hou dejian sources indicated they 
were taken into police custody possibly as a protective move before 
the june 4 anniversary 
three beijing university students were arrested may 25 for 
alleged counterrevolutionary activities 
the latest prisoner release announced by the official xinhua 
news agency included for the first time two top student leaders 
xiong wei and zhou fengsuo both students at qinghua university in 
beijing were arrested last june after being included on the 
governments list of 21 mostwanted students 
zhou was turned in by his sister and xiong surrendered in his 
mothers company according to official accounts the no 1 student 
on the list wang dan remains in jail 
xinhua said 19 other students also were freed 
most of the releases were from beijing jails but 21 were freed 
in shanghai among those was yao yongzhan a hong kong student who 
was released tuesday according to the hong kong government 
yao who was arrested at shanghai airport in june 1989 as he was 
about to board a flight to hong kong returned to the british colony 
wednesday 
xinhua said the 97 were given lenient treatment after having 
voluntarily confessed their wrongdoings and expressed a 
willingness to repent none had been charged or tried 
it said the government combined punishment with leniency in 
dealing with the protesters and made every effort to educate 
those who can be educated those who obstinately stick to an 
incorrect course and refuse to repent will be punished strictly in 
accordance with the law 
in another deveopment grassroots communist party committees in 
a region of china where a minority rebellion occurred in april will 
undergo a shakeup 
the xinjiang uygur autonomous region party committee will spend 
the next two to three years carrying out a rectification of party 
grassroots organizations and grassroots power the xinjiang 
daily newspaper said 
rectification is the partys euphemism for an intense 
investigation followed by purges of anyone failing to measure up to 
the political standard 
moslem ethnic minorities declared a holy war in april in baren 
township in xinjiang near the western border with the soviet union 
official reports say 22 died in an attempt to set up an independent 
republic of east turkistan the attempt was put down by soldiers and 
armed police

someone threw a grenade last week at the us 
embassy in somalia and us officials are concerned about growing 
anarchy in the strategically placed african country a us official 
said on wednesday 
the grenade which exploded without significant damage or 
injuries was lobbed into the embassy compound by an unknown 
assailant an administration official said 
the embassy complex the largest in subsaharan africa boasts 
three swimming pools and a ninehole golf course 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
seaside capital has been beset in recent months by fuel shortages 
water and electricity interruptions and rampant crime the 
security situation is at a nadir he said 
foreign reporters are usually denied access to somalia at the 
tip of the horn of africa on the eastern approaches to the red sea 
and reliable information about the situation there is hard to obtain 
the government of siad barre has been losing power over the past 
year to various coalitions of rebels fighting to unseat the aging 
oftenruthless leader the military is just not defeating them 
said the official 
despite the deterioration of security and the widespread 
opposition to barre us officials do not think he will be toppled 
in the near future somalia is unstable but were not expecting 
anything like that imminently the official said 
one reason is the disunity among the rebel groups and the lack of 
a leader with sufficient popularity or clout to replace barre who 
seized power in a 1968 coup 
barres repressive government has become increasingly isolated 
and the united states once one of somalias main backers has cut 
off virtually all aid plans call for the us embassy staff of 430 
to be reduced by half by years end 
the united states still has an agreement to use the somali port 
of berbera as a contingency base in case of an emergency in the 
region 
human rights groups say that as barres control has slipped his 
abuses have grown in an effort to exert control 
a threemember delegation from amnesty international will leave 
for mogadishu on saturday to discuss gross violations of human 
rights with somali authorities an official with the human rights 
organization said the group last visited in june 1989 
a report commissioned by the state department last summer 
concluded that the somali army murdered at least 5000 people over 
an 11month period

the bush administrations protocol chief 
joseph reed wednesday accused minnesota democratic gov rudy 
perpich of behaving very badly in barring the states two 
republican senators from a luncheon for soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
it was my understanding with governor perpich that they were to 
be invited as far as im concerned he reneged on that 
understanding reed told reporters at he white house 
in st paul minn perpich angrily denied that he ever agreed 
the senators would be invited to the gorbachev luncheon 
i feel very badly that such a successful visit could be marred 
by petty politics the governor said 
reed said sens david durenburger and rudy boschwitz showed up at 
the door of the governors mansion and were turned away from 
sundays luncheon for the visiting soviet vips 
they were directed instead to a luncheon next door for other 
politicians who were not invited said reed the state department 
official who was sent along by president bush to help facilitate 
gorbachevs swing through minnesota and san francisco after the 
soviet leader left washington last sunday 
and when i learned this there was nothing that could be 
done reed said of the slight to the two senators after all i 
was only a guest also i was not the host so i urged directly with 
president gorbachev that he meet the two senators and the entire 
congressional delegation which he did following the luncheon 
gorbachev held a hastily arranged handshaking session with the 
senators and other members of congress who had been excluded from 
the lunch 
the governor of minnesota behaved very badly reed said 
citing the incident as the only flaw in gorbachevs visit to the 
united states 
the two senators were not neglected by gorbachev both were 
invited to fly with him from washington to minnesota only boschwitz 
could accept and he had a long conversation with gorbachev on the 
flight

army officials and two pilots involved in the 
us invasion of panama hailed the use of nightvision goggles 
wednesday as lawmakers expressed concerns about accidents when the 
devices were used 
the us army and army aviation own the night maj gen 
rudolph ostovich iii commanding general of the us army aviation 
center told a house panel 
the army officials said use of the goggles during the december 
nighttime incursion provided the us military with a significant 
advantage in stopping the panamanian defense forces 
nightvision goggles electronically amplify moonlight and 
starlight displaying images on two tiny video screens 
capt tim jones whose helicopter was shot down during the 
invasion said he was in the area near fort amador for 20 minutes 
seeking out the enemy before his craft was fired upon 
he attributed the shootdown to a gunner sweeping the area or 
firing in the vicinity where he could hear helicopters 
if it had been the daytime i shudder to think what the results 
may have been had they been able to see us as well as the 20 plus 
other helicopters that came into that area jones said 
chief warrant officer larry mann who has worked with 
nightvision goggles for 10 years said without the devices it would 
have been a lot more catastrophic for us 
rep frank mccloskey dind an outspoken critic of the goggles 
said the use of the devices apparently contributed to the success of 
us invasion but stressed that there was no excuse for unsafe 
training procedures 
mccloskey noted recent statistics that show 77 nightvision 
goggles accidents per 100000 flying hours for the third and fourth 
quarters of 1989 and the first quarter of 1990 the armys overall 
flight accident rate is 18 accidents per 100000 hours 
the lawmaker said that since march 1988 there have been 22 
accidents and 70 deaths 
i realize semantic differences exist between myself and the 
pentagon as to whether a specific accident was caused by the goggles 
or by pilot error mccloskey said 
however the goggle technology while impressive does have 
limitations and these limitations must be recognized when the 
goggles are used in aviation

communist albania pledged wednesday to 
adopt basic reforms short of free elections and seek equal 
status with the 35 nations that signed the helsinki security and 
human rights accords 
albanian representatives to an eastwest human rights meeting 
said their country would also seek full membership in the conference 
on security and cooperation in europe as soon as possible 
adhering to the helsinki agreements and joining the conference 
would be major steps for the isolated balkan nation of 3 million 
the sole remaining hardline communist country in eastern europe 
after democratic reforms swept across its east bloc neighbors the 
past year 
the game is that we adopt all the rules of the conference and 
of course take care to accept what has been accepted by the other 
participating counrties said petriti bushati albanias 
ambassador to sweden who led the delegation 
but he said albania needed a transition period to study the 
international conventions which it would have to affirm as a 
condition for membership a consensus of conference members would be 
required to admit albania 
on tuesday the delegation was granted observer status to a 
conference meeting the 35 nations are holding a fourweek session 
to consider proposals on political pluralism and the rule of law in 
the member states 
albania is the only nation in europe that refused to sign the 
1975 helsinki agreements the group also includes the united states 
and canada 
despite some reforms albania has no intention to hold multiparty 
elections bejo sazan an albanian foreign ministry official told a 
news conference 
sazan said albania had no history of organized political 
opposition and he claimed the ruling communist party represented 
the interests of all the people 
no society anywhere where there is full approval of the 
government by the people would artificially create an opposition 
to this government he said we cannot see what will happen in 
50 years or 100 years but that is the situation today in albania 
there were reports earlier this year of politically or 
economically inspired riots outside the capital but they were never 
confirmed by the government 
asked about political prisoners bushati confirmed 85 prisoners 
are being held but said they were guilty of using violence to try 
to overthrow the government 
albania announced a series of reforms last month including freer 
travel for its citizens and abolition of restrictions on religious 
publications it also adopted economic reforms relaxing government 
control over enterprises 
premier adil carcani told the parliament in tirana in may that 
albania wanted to join the conference and establish diplomatic 
relations with the united states the soviet union and the members 
of the european community

the presidents of the baltic states of lithuania 
latvia and estonia asked president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
to open talks at once on their drives for independence a latvian 
spokesman said 
the council of baltic states appeals to you mr president to 
call a joint meeting without delay to define the issues and the 
order of full negotiations the telegram said 
aris jansons an aide to latvian president anatoly gorbunov 
translated the telegram unofficially in a telephone interview from 
the republics capital of riga where the three presidents signed it 
the meeting was the second gathering of the council since it was 
reestablished last month it came a day after gorbachev returned 
from the superpower summit in washington to face renewed unrest in 
the southern soviet union and impasse in the baltics 
gorbachevs tough stance with the baltics particularly 
lithuania has brought him censure from the west but president bush 
still signed an agreement with him last week opening the way to 
trade benefits for the soviet union 
members of the us congress however predict bush will have a 
hard time gaining needed support for the measure as long as 
gorbachev refuses to negotiate with lithuania 
at a news conference after the signing presidents gorbunov of 
latvia vytautas landsbergis of lithuania and arnold ruutel of 
estonia generally reserved judgment on what effect the superpower 
summit would have on the secessionist baltic region 
but jansons said gorbunov noted because neither gorbachev nor 
bush appeared to have changed his position on the issue in that 
sense we can conclude that the summit in washington was nothing new 
for us 
landsbergis said it was too early to predict what the summits 
effect would be and ruutel said it may help strengthen soviet 
democracy said jansons 
he said they kept their remarks brief and did not go into 
specifics 
lithuania declared its independence on march 11 and latvia and 
estonia have since announced the beginning of transition periods to 
full independence 
gorbachev clamped a partial economic blockade on lithuania in 
response and refused to recognize latvian and estonian independence 
moves he told prime minister kazimiera prunskiene of lithuania he 
would not open negotiations with her republic until it suspended its 
declaration 
the baltic council also ratified a pledge wednesday that 
nonnative permanent residents of the republics would be guaranteed 
full human rights jansons said many russians in the baltic 
republics say they fear they may become secondclass citizens or be 
forced to leave when the three states become fully independent 
the telegram to gorbachev complained that delays in settling 
relations between the baltics and the kremlin have led to the 
disorder of the economy and abnormal relations between peoples 
jansons said 
in latvia panic buying spurred by fears that the kremlin would 
include it in the partial blockade prompted authorities to introduce 
rationing on several food items last week 
in lithuania more than 400 factories have cut back their working 
hours and about 50000 people have been laid off reports said 
the three independent baltic states were annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 they revived their preworld war ii alliance on may 
12 it was orginally established in 1934

liberian president samuel k doe has asked the 
united states to help him deal with an increasingly powerful rebel 
movement that threatens to topple his government an administration 
official said on wednesday 
the official said earlier wednesday that doe has asked for help 
in getting out of the country but that same official later said he 
was unsure of his facts and knew only that doe had sent a letter 
asking for help in resolving the issue 
us diplomats told doe he should attempt to reach an 
accommodation with insurgent leaders said the official who asked 
not to be identified 
meanwhile other officials said the administration is arranging 
special flights to allow several hundred american citizens to leave 
liberia because of the deteriorating situation there 
the officials said the us government is in contact with an air 
carrier that will fly the americans to the neighboring ivory coast 
from where they will be flown to the united states 
the intermediate stop in the ivory coast is necessary because the 
biggest airport still operating in liberia is too small to 
accommodate large jetliners the operation is expected to begin on 
saturday 
but some americans are expected to be on two regularly scheduled 
air guinea international flights thursday and another on friday 
the state department is strongly urging all of the more than 
3000 americans still in liberia to leave the country because of the 
concerns about personal safety 
the us navy has a fourship flotilla in international waters 
off the liberian coast to evacuate the americans and possibly 
foreign diplomats if departures cannot be carried out through 
commercial means 
in response to a request from the soviet union the united states 
has said it would be willing to include soviet diplomats along with 
others in any evacuation state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said 
commenting on does situation the officials said the state 
department has been quietly asking several african countries whether 
they would be willing to provide him with a safe haven if he is 
forced to flee 
the officials refused to say which countries have been approached 
or what the responses were 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater had no comment on us 
diplomatic efforts in liberia except to say that both the government 
and the rebels have been asked to find a way to end their conflict 
the inquiries about a safe haven for doe underscore the 
administrations impression that his 10year old rule will not 
survive much longer and that what began as a tiny rebel movement 
last december probably will assume power shortly 
the rebels have seized the headquarters of the worlds largest 
rubber plantation owned by the japanese tiremaker bridgestone 
corp liberias biggest employer and are now believed to control 
every major industrial concern in the west african country 
the officials said there is little in the background of the rebel 
leader charles taylor to suggest a strong commitment to democratic 
principles 
the extent to which the rebels have been able to generate support 
is less a reflection of taylors appeal than of the widespread 
opposition to does government according to the officials 
doe is widely accused of mismanaging the economy his problems 
have been compounded by tribal divisions and mass desertions from 
the liberian army 
taylor 42 is a former high liberian government official who 
five years ago escaped from a massachusetts prison where he was 
awaiting extradition to his homeland on charges he had embezzled 
millions of dollars in public funds 
taylor who has studied in the united states has denied us 
charges that his group received backing from libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi 
historically the united states has had close ties with liberia 
because the country was founded by descendants of freed us slaves 
more than 150 years ago liberia also serves as a center for us 
military communications and as a relay station for voice of america 
broadcasts to africa

the us justice department was 
considering its next move wednesday after a federal judge threw out 
a desegregation lawsuit against the charleston county school 
district 
us district judge sol blatt jr late tuesday dismissed the 1981 
lawsuit which challenged a 1967 law creating the nearly 
43000student countywide school district 
in another decadesold desegregation battle school officials in 
jacksonville fla and naacp leaders agreed on a countywide 
desegregation plan with reduced mandatory busing 
in the south carolina case blatt found no intent to discriminate 
by state lawmakers who passed the 1967 law he ruled that some 
schools in the district remain predominantly black because of the 
makeup of neighborhoods geography and decisions by white parents to 
put their students in private schools 
justice department spokeswoman amy casner said the department was 
reviewing the decision and had not decided whether to appeal notice 
of appeal must generally be made within 60 days she said in a 
telephone interview from washington 
the 1967 act created a countywide school board to oversee eight 
local school districts and spread tax money among them the local 
boards retained control of faculty and student assignments however 
making it slightly more difficult to achieve greater 
desegregation blatt found 
the justice department later joined by the naacp legal defense 
and education fund asked that the local districts be abolished and 
blatt order a better integration plan 
fiftysix percent of the districts 42774 students are black 35 
percent of the black students attend classes in schools that are 90 
percent black but blatt said this was not necessarily evidence of 
illegal segregation 
it is possible that even without the local districts true 
integration would be impossible in charleston county because of its 
rather unique geography the judge wrote 
with all of its rivers and bridges and its nearly 100mile 
area extensive busing would be extremely dangerous he said 
blatts decision followed years of delays in the case and 11 
months of arguments in a nonjury trial involving 80 witnesses and 
more than 2600 exhibits 
arthur mcfarland an attorney representing student plaintiffs in 
the case said the decision will have to be reviewed before an 
appeal is considered 
in jacksonville the duval county school board and us district 
judge john h moore ii must approve the agreement school officials 
reached with the local chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
it would eliminate the busing of some 14000 students change 
groupings of grade levels provide 60 million for innercity school 
improvements and set up programs to attract students of all races to 
schools that have predominantly black enrollments 
superintendent larry zenke called the agreement reached tuesday 
after almost six months of negotiations a winwin proposition 
for both sides 
the rev henry green president of a coalition of about 60 black 
ministers said black residents must take a waitandsee attitude 
to make sure that promises that have been made are kept because so 
many promises that have been made in the past have been broken 
duval county was ordered by a federal judge in the early 1960s to 
desegregate its schools courtordered crosstown busing began in 
1971 and the naacp sued again in 1985 claiming the school system 
was not fully desegregated 
moore ruled in 1988 that students in duval county were getting an 
equal education but last fall an appeals court disagreed and placed 
the school system back under court review leading to the recent 
negotiations

argentines and east germans no longer require visas 
to enter britain the home office said wednesday 
the requirement will be dropped as of thursday said the home 
office which is responsible for immigration regulations 
the lifting of the curbs on east german citizens follows a joint 
agreement signed by common market countries last month 
there has been no announcement from argentina that it will allow 
british citizens to travel there without visas but such an 
announcement is expected 
an agreement signed earlier this year by foreign secretary 
douglas hurd and his argentine counterpart domingo cavallo paved 
the way for the restrictions to be lifted 
the two met in february and agreed to restore diplomatic links 
broken during the falklands war direct air travel had resumed 
earlier 
in a related development wednesday the organization of american 
states urged argentina and britain to continue negotiation until 
they reach definitive solution to all their differences over the 
falklands islands 
none of the britishargentine negotiations nor the steps taken so 
far imply any change in argentinas clim to sovereignty over the 
islands argentine delegate juan pablo lohle told the oas which is 
meeting in asuncion paraguay 
britain has ruled the falklands since 1833 but argentina which 
calls the islands the malvinas claims it inherited them upon 
declaring independence from spain in 1810 
argentine forces in 1982 seized the falklands 300 miles off 
argentinas southeast coast but a british task force retook the 
islands during the 74day war in which 712 argentines 255 britons 
and three islanders were killed

lawmakers took testimony wednesday on a 
bill intended to test the 1973 us supreme court decision 
legalizing abortion 
a gynecologist who said she stopped performing abortions because 
she felt like she was working in a slaughterhouse was among the 
witnesses who appeared before the state house criminal justice 
committee 
i just asked myself one day what am i doing ripping apart 
these beautifully formed bodies testified dr beverly mcmillan 
of jackson miss 
the louisiana legislature has a history of enacting tough 
abortion laws all of which have been stayed or declared 
unconstitutional over the past 15 years 
opponents of the latest bill acknowledge it will pass and be used 
to take advantage of what antiabortion activists hope is a 
readiness on the increasingly conservative supreme court to reverse 
its 1973 decision 
the supreme court in effect ruled in roe vs wade that nobody 
can know at what moment life begins geneticist jerome lejeune of 
paris testified wednesday but in the past 17 years geneticists 
have proven that the precise starting moment is the time that all 
genetic information is gathered in the fertilized egg lejeune 
said 
that moment is conception he said 
lejeunes testimony in a tennessee case was instrumental in a 
ruling last year that seven frozen embryos were human beings with 
constitutional rights that ruling will be considered by a state 
appeals court 
the committee was to hear testimony from opponents of the bill on 
thursday then take action 
rep woody jenkins a leader of the antiabortion effort pleaded 
with the committee not to amend the bill with exceptions such as 
for cases of rape and incest which he said would be inconsistent 
with past louisiana law the bill makes an exception only to save 
the life of the mother 
gov buddy roemer a democrat has said he will veto any bill 
that does not also make exceptions for victims of rape and incest 
and to protect the health of the mother

loyalist troops killed a commander of 
rebels bearing down on the capital and us officials said 
wednesday they were arranging special flights to evacuate americans 
from liberia 
the special flights which begin saturday would allow several 
hundred american citizens to leave liberia because of the 
deteriorating situation there said us officials in washington 
the state department is strongly urging the estimated 2000 
americans in this west african nation to leave because of the 
concerns about personal safety 
several miles off monrovia four us warships carrying 2000 
marines remained poised for a fourth day to evacuate americans and 
other foreigners officials said 
another american official in washington said president samuel k 
doe had asked for us help the bush administration official 
speaking on condition of anonymity corrected his earlier statement 
that doe had requested american help to leave liberia 
diplomats in monrovia said doe had refused a us offer of safe 
passage 
one bush administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said doe had requested american help but was told by us 
diplomats he should attempt to reach some sort of accord with 
insurgent leaders the official earlier said doe had asked for help 
in getting out of the country but he later amended his comment 
saying he knew only that doe had asked for us help 
doe met tuesday with christian and moslem leaders who offered to 
mediate between him and the rebels the meeting was stormy with doe 
angered by church leaders suggestion he resign an official source 
said 
doe took over the country of 25 million people in a bloody coup 
10 years ago the rebels accuse his administration of corruption 
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses 
information minister emmanuel bouwier and rebel forces on 
wednesday reported the death of the ustrained rebel commander 
elmer johnson both sides gave no details of his killing 
johnson said he served with the us military and was a member of 
the american forces that invaded grenada in 1983 though his claim 
could not independently confirmed 
refugees reaching monrovia meanwhile said rebels killed dozens 
of krahn and mandingo civilians in their advance toward monrovia a 
city of 400000 people suffering widespread shortages of foodstuffs 
due to the insurgency an african ambassador said only that the 
slayings occurred in several towns 
one mandingo woman said that in her town rebels burst into a 
mosque and began firing on people who spoke the mandingo dialect 
they just shot the people she said 
the civil war has pitted mandingos and krahns who support doe 
against gio and mano peoples which back rebel leader charles 
taylor troops supporting doe who is a krahn are accused of 
killing hundreds of rebel supporters 
the seeds of the ethnic war began in november 1985 when brig 
gen thomas quiwonkpa largely backed by gios and manos tried to 
overthrow doe quiwonkpa managed to take over much of monrovia 
before he was killed 
in revenge hundreds of gios and manos were killed according to 
international human rights organizations 
taylors rebels launched their invasion from eastern nimba 
county the homeland of gios and manos they have been within 
striking distance of monrovia since reaching the gates of 
robertsfield international airport on tuesday 
in the past day the rebels have made no attempt to advance 
since monday international carriers have refused to fly into the 
airport 25 miles from the capital 
retreating soldiers on wednesday opened fire on two american 
journalists at a roadblock at scheiffelin barracks between the 
capital and the airport neither man was wounded 
they yelled at us and gesticulated with their guns saying give 
us the car we tried not to run and then got into the car the 
driver made a uturn and then they fired at us i think two maybe 
three shots said stephen smith of milford conn he is a 
reporter for the french newspaper liberation he said the shots did 
not hit the car 
we looked back and saw a soldier kneeling down and firing at us 
it was not a warning shot said smith who was accompanied by 
michael roddy a new yorkbased reporter for the reuters news agency 
smith said they saw dozens of soldiers commandeering cars 
forcing passengers out and crowded into the vehicles 
on tuesday rebels captured a large rubber plantation and several 
other government strongholds plantation residents said dozens of 
rebels crossed the farmington river the last natural barrier 
before monrovia and moved onto the huge firestone tire and rubber 
co plantation the company is a subsidiary of japans bridgestone 
company 
residents said on wednesday rebels gathered about 28 expatriates 
managing the plantation and told them the installations would not be

the chinese government still clamps down on 
political freedom bans labor demonstrations and imprisons 
dissenters a year after the killings near tiananmen square in 
beijing us officials said wednesday 
despite that the bush administration wants to retain trade 
benefits for the chinese government a state department official 
told senators 
members of a senate foreign relations subcommittee clashed with 
richard h solomon assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs over the administrations china trade decision in a 
prickly session 
you really cant defend china here sen joseph biden 
ddel told solomon you cant defend them on trade you cant 
begin to defend them on human rights i find them absolutely 
reprehensible in the way they have conducted themselves 
biden asked solomon about reports that china was providing 
missiles and poison gases to the middle east and solomon replied 
that officials have received some indication that something might 
be going on in regard to chinas role in developing poison gas for 
others 
a congressional aide speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there have been reports that china has helped libya in the 
production of poison gases 
solomon said us officials have relayed to top chinese officials 
their concern over reports about beijings exports of warmaking 
technologies to the middle east the chinese have promised not to 
sell missiles to syria he said 
there are many evil regimes in this world today but none more 
deserves to be overthrown by its people than the one in beijing 
said sen jesse helms rnc 
a number of lawmakers have promised an attempt to block president 
bushs decision to continue most favored nation trade status for 
china for another year the designation would allow the lowest 
possible tariffs on chinese goods 
solomon acknowledged the bush administration is concerned about 
events in china a country where he said the underlying anger of 
the citizens towards the regime remains great 
labor unrest is a particular serious problem for the chinese 
prompting the government to raise salaries in an effort to contain 
workers solomon said at the same time he said demonstrations are 
banned 
solomon said also that us officials are disturbed about reports 
that the chinese are using forced labor to work in factories 
including those that make clothing exports for the united states 
between 10000 and 15000 people were imprisoned after the bloody 
massacre at tiananmen square us officials said today some 2000 
remain in prison although us officials said their reporting 
techniques were imprecise 
us officials have been disappointed by the chinese governments 
efforts to bring about reconciliation with students protesters 
solomon said 
still he added bush and his aides believe it would be 
counterproductive to halt trade with china as a means of showing 
disapproval 
our policy towards china seeks to encourage reform and human 
rights through a considered mix of engagement and sanction he 
said should most favored nation trading status be withdrawn from 
china the real losers would be chinas economic reformers and 
workers in export industries solomon said 
us diplomats in beijing believe most prodemocracy advocates 
would object to washington cutting trade ties with china solomon 
said but he acknowledged there were divisions of opinion among the 
chinese 
solomon also tried to play down the significance of most favored 
nation status as a diplomatic tool he pointed out for instance 
that some other countries criticized for human rights violations 
among them syria iraq and south africa receive the same treatment 
but sen alan cranston dcalif said the argument for us 
engagement as a way to bring about reform was one that was rejected 
by congress when it imposed economic sanctions on south africa 
the congressional hearing came as chinese student leaders made 
the rounds on capitol hill urging lawmakers to take concrete 
actions to promote human rights in china

state lawmakers finished work on a 528 
million public school finance reform package wednesday sending it 
to gov bill clements for his promised signature after months of 
special sessions on education 
i do think its a good bill i think its a great step 
forward clements said we made some very significant changes in 
the way were going to do business in public education in the state 
of texas 
lawmakers continued work on other bills but planned to end this 
session a record sixth and their fourth on courtordered school 
finance reform on thursday they have been meeting on education 
since february 
the funding reform package represents a compromise between 
democratic legislative leaders and the republican governor for 
meeting a state supreme court order to make more money available to 
poor school districts 
the house wednesday approved 13612 a bill outlining reforms in 
school funding and administration it also passed 1422 a measure 
making budget cuts and fund transfers to help raise money for 
education and financially strapped social service programs 
both bills earlier passed the senate 
the house and senate on tuesday passed a feeandtax package to 
raise the bulk of the 528 million for the school plan and about 
100 million for social services 
the tax bill includes a quartercent boost in the state sales 
tax currently 6 cents on the dollar 
clements killed two previous school finance reform plans because 
they each relied on a halfcent increase in the sales tax but he 
said he agreed to the quartercent increase to compromise and fend 
off the prospect of a courtwritten funding plan for schools 
i think that the quartercent sales tax will be dropped in due 
course i dont think that its really necessary for school funding 
for that to continue and im optimistic that in the next 
regular session it will be dropped clements said the 
legislature convenes in regular session in january 
some lawmakers said the legislation does not go far enough to 
meet the courts order to develop a constitutional system rep 
gregory luna said that among other things it includes no funding 
for school facilities 
members we will be back dont fool yourself we havent 
resolved the issue luna a democrat told lawmakers 
clements said i think that what we have passed here and what 
we have agreed upon will more than satisfy the courts 
thats my personal opinion and being a nonlawyer and a 
nonjurist and noneverything else why you know what my opinion is 
worth he added 
the 528 million would be pumped during the 199091 school year 
into the 135 billionayear school system which relies on state 
aid local property taxes and some federal money 
the package also includes increased testing of students 
exempting exemplary schools from certain state regulations and 
giving the governor authority to appoint the state education 
commissioner currently named by the state board of education 
texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned 
school finance systems in recent years the others are kentucky new 
jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut washington west 
virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
clements who is not seeking reelection said he hopes lawmakers 
will continue working to reform the education system

the pathologist whose friends call him 
dr death said wednesday he had no regrets about his role in 
ending the life of an alzheimers disease victim with a machine he 
devised 
why shouldnt they call me that or even dr suicide dr 
jack kevorkian said during an interview at his home in this detroit 
suburb why should it bother me death is a concept were all 
going to face it 
janet adkins flew 2000 miles from her home in portland ore to 
face death monday afternoon in kevorkians 1968 volkswagen van 
kevorkian 62 and a relative drove with mrs adkins to a park 
where they attached her first to a heart monitor and then to an 
intravenous tube 
mrs adkins 54 pressed a button that delivered a muscle 
relaxant and fatal doses of chemicals that put her into a coma then 
stopped her heart 
death came minutes afterward said kevorkian who delivered the 
body to police 
her last words to me were something like thank you thank you 
very much he said i wished her a good trip and as i leaned 
over her she seemed like she was rising to meet me perhaps to give 
me a kiss of gratitude 
kevorkian said mrs adkins had asked him to publicize her method 
of death to help others her dying wish was granted kevorkians 
name appeared wednesday on the front pages of newspapers nationwide 
i dont think ive broken a law kevorkian said i dont 
expect to be prosecuted but you never know what happens in a highly 
emotional society 
oakland county prosecutor richard thompson said wednesday he has 
yet to determine whether kevorkian committed a crime state police 
impounded the retired pathologists van 
thompson asked circuit judge hilda gage to issue a temporary 
restraining order preventing kevorkian from letting anyone else use 
his device in the county gage scheduled a hearing on the request 
for friday 
the michigan department of licensing and regulation on wednesday 
began investigating kevorkians role in adkins suicide said mary 
macdowell director of the departments health investigation 
division 
if the investigation determines that kevorkian violated the state 
public health code the state board of medicine could impose 
sanctions ranging from a reprimand to suspension or revocation of 
the physicians medical license mcdowell said 
kevorkians disdain of prosecution is matched by his scorn for 
the medical profession which he said is dominated by a dark ages 
morality hostile to his proeuthanasia views 
everyone says to me hey youre taking on yourself like god 
well then come on and do something he said if its legal 
let me do it if its illegal stop me 
the pontiac native received his medical degree in 1952 from the 
university of michigan 
he had developed a reputation as an outsider by the time he 
completed his residency in 1958 said a colleague who has known him 
for more than 40 years 
hes had unique ideas he thinks differently said dr murray 
levin 60 of bloomfield hills he wanted to use cadaver blood for 
blood transfusions thats something they maybe do in russia 
hes always been a free thinker said dr gerald abrams a 
former classmate of kevorkians and now a professor of pathology at 
the university of michigan medical school he always impressed us 
as being very bright very sincere his arent exactly mainstream 
ideas 
kevorkian joined pontiac general hospital in 1959 and spent about 
10 years there before opening a diagnostic clinic in southfield he 
worked from 1969 to 1976 at saratoga general hospital in detroit 
then at several small hospitals in the los angeles area before 
returning to michigan 
kevorkian a bachelor said he retired in 1982 to study ethics 
write articles for european medical and law journals and dabble in 
surrealistic paintings with medical themes and titles like 
nausea fever and coma 
theyre pretty powerful kevorkian said theyre not great 
art but theyve got a lot of impact i like to shake people up 
but developing his suicide device has taken up the time he used 
to spend painting 
hes a loner levin said hes dropped out of medical 
circles as far as i know it bothers me why a guy so competent and 
wellabled is retired 
in 1988 kevorkian asked the hemlock society which advocates the 
right to death on demand to refer terminally ill members to a 
center he wanted to open in california said derek humphry the 
societys founder and executive director 
i persuaded him not to take up in california humphry said by 
telephone from the netherlands where he was presiding over a 
convention of the world federation of right to die societies we 
didnt want to be involved in lawbreaking 
dr kevorkian is to be praised for his courage and his 
compassion humprhy said the history of the world shows that it 
sometimes takes a zealot to change peoples thinking

a jury on wednesday awarded comedian pat 
paulsen 233337 in damages in a lawsuit that accused his exwife of 
diverting funds from his business while working as his booking agent 
paulsen joked after the award that it will help in in his next 
whimsical campaign for the presidency 
this makes me a more viable candidate with a scandal and this 
is really a big one he told the rocky mountain news in a 
telephone interview from a hotel near washington 
whether he ever collects any of the money is not the point 
paulsen said its a moral victory more than anything ten million 
dollars wouldnt be worth all this hassle and all the stress 
linda chaney paulsen whose 162000 counterclaim against the 
comedian was rejected was not in court wednesday either 
contacted later she told the news i didnt do what ive been 
accused of which will become very clear in future legal 
proceedings 
the jefferson county district court jury deliberated six hours 
before reaching its verdict in the trial that began may 29

divorce two months after their 1988 marriage of diverting up to 
200000 in 1987 and 1988 from pat paulsen enterprises inc of 
lakewood where she was booking agent 
he also claimed his exwife hid business records from him leaked 
harmful stories about him to the national enquirer and faked 
illnesses and nosebleeds to get his sympathy 
in testimony in the case accountant robert arshagouni said he 
was aware the woman kept at least 157000 more than she was 
supposed to from paulsens performance fees 
she denied the allegations and filed a countersuit claiming 
paulsen married and divorced her simply to take over the business 
paulsen first gained national popularity on the smothers 
brothers comedy hour a 1960s tv show since then he has 
sporadically mounted tongueincheek campaigns for president and 
kept busy on the lecture circuit

million or one in a billion said district attorney kenneth

mary wesleys mailbox is frequently filled 
with letters from frustrated wouldbe novelists 
i get letters from people who say theyve always wanted to 
write a book and they want to know how i did it she says 
at 77 wesley is a newcomer to fiction she published the first 
of her seven novels when she was 70 her latest a sensible 
life topped the british bestseller list its first week of 
publication and will be published in the united states this summer 
the diminutive author dressed in navy blue sweatshirt light 
blue jeans and pearl earrings had been writing for 40 years and 
tearing up the pages except for two childrens books she only 
started writing seriously after her husband of 25 years journalist 
eric siepmann died in 1970 
my husband used to tell me i could write but i thought it was 
just because he loved me she said in an interview at her timbered 
elizabethan house in southwest england i was unhappy very poor 
writing purged myself of the destructive desperation 
she describes writing as a compulsion its companionship 
but its not always enjoyable it can be painful and frustrating 
like a dog digging at a rabbit hole when the rabbit is long gone 
a friend persuaded her to find a publisher for her first novel 
jumping the queue a black comedy about a middleaged widow on 
the brink of suicide it got enthusiastic reviews and sold 
respectably 
a sensible life traces the life of flora who achieves her 
childhood ambition of loving three men she meets as a girl 
abandoned by her selfabsorbed parents flora matures into a tough 
confident and attractive woman and eventually in middle age she 
settles down with one of the three men 
wesley captures the flavor of blackedout wartime london boozy 
weekends at country houses a lonely childs desperation her 
description of floras feverish cold makes the reader sniffle 
the book includes the ingredients wesley fans have come to 
expect a carefully drawn wartime setting upperclass english 
characters jaunty dialogue and racy scenes 
people go on about sex in my books because im so old wesley 
said when i was 30 i thought that i wouldnt have sex when i was 
40 and when i was 40 i thought id stop at 50 and so on but sex 
goes on no matter how old you are 
her plots can be complicated but her style is simple and 
unadorned an attribute she says comes from her frugality with 
paper in less prosperous times i hate overwriting the expense of 
foolscap helped my writing it made me more concise she said 
the author denies her vivid characters are modeled on herself 
but gutsy women from privileged backgrounds unafraid to defy 
convention are consistent with wesleys persona 
wesley like flora and helena dared to breach accepted behavior 
and was divorced as one of her characters would say when it was 
simply not done 
after the divorce many suitors were interested but it was 
siepmann who spotted her in the ritz hotel and gave her unbroken 
happiness wesley still feels the loss she often catches herself 
making a mental note to tell eric something amusing she has heard 
gardening writing and answering fan mail fill her day 
after an appearance on a popular radio program she says she got 
three letters one was an invitation to a literary lunch the 
second said if youre afraid to die here are the phone numbers for 
three clairvoyants and the third said theyd seen a picture of me 
admired my teeth and wanted the name of my dentist 
wesley said she is afraid of the process of dying but not of 
death itself 
im interested to know what happens she said i cannot 
believe there is nothing beyond and if there is then well thats 
that 
she is energetic and swims three times a week i dont feel 
that old i dont think about it she said i resent getting 
tired but i can see hear and chew i find it tiresome the way 
people talk about their age and illnesses 
publicity makes the author uncomfortable 
i feel very overexposed she said its a creepy feeling 
because im used to observing others and now im being observed 
her advice to those frustrated novelists who write to her is 
read read and keep on reading books have been her education 
but she cautions that writing is much harder than it may seem 
ive been lucky she says i wouldnt recommend it for 
anyone

enrollment in american seminaries the source for 
filling pulpits across the country turned upward last term after 
declining slowly but steadily for the past five years 
there are now more older students involved and more women 
so far the seminary output is about keeping up with the needs 
for new ministers in protestant denominations but theres a 
shortage in a growing number of catholic dioceses 
the new figures on seminarians were compiled by the association 
of theological schools based in vandalia ohio it includes most 
accredited protestant and roman catholic seminaries in the country 
203 of them 
their total enrollment reached 56083 up 51 percent over the 
55405 at start of the 198889 term which had been the low point in 
a gradual slide since 1984 when enrollment peaked at 56466 
while roman catholicism is experiencing priest shortages most 
major protestant denominations are just about replenishing their 
needs says the rev william baumgaertner the associations 
associate director 
theyre reasonably well supplied but theres no great 
surplus he added in an interview 
noting signs that a growing proportion of the current crop of 
seminarians plan careers other than the ordained ministry he said 
the sharp increase this year may well reflect the success of 
school efforts to serve a broader constituency with a variety of 
graduate level programs 
he said an increasing percentage of unordained but trained 
specialists now share responsibilities with clergy as music 
directors religious education leaders pastoral counselors and 
other ministries 
the base of ministry has shifted away from all being ordained 
to a lot of others who are not but who have advanced degrees for 
their specialities baumgaertner said 
he said the prevelance of older students has remained high with 
the average age about 31 many second career students those 
pursuing ordination after working in other fields are in their late 
30s or 40s 
they make about a fourth of the entire seminary enrolment 
the number of women students and their proportion of the total 
stays on the upgrade a trend that has gone on since 1972 when 
they constituted only 10 percent of seminary students 
at that time women were a relatively small but pioneering band 
of 3358 now the total is five times greater 16270 they amount 
to 29 percent of the total seminarians up 2 points in the last two 
years 
their ranks are not growing as rapidly as before 
baumgaertner said but their steady increase has brought predictions 
that a fourth of mainline protestant pastors will be women by the 
centurys end 
most major protestant bodies united methodist episcopal 
presbyterian american baptists lutheran and reformed now admit 
women to ordination although theyre barred from it in roman 
catholicism and eastern orthodxy 
among southern baptists its a controversial issue but some of 
their congregations have ordained women 
black students in seminary have increased steadily for two 
decades the gain averaging 55 percent per year for the past five 
years and now totalling 3814 
blacks now make up 68 percent of the total seminary enrolment 
compared to 42 percent a decade ago 
there is reason for encouragement in these statistics 
baumgaertner said 
however he said the increase in hispanic seminarians has been 
too slow to meet the needs up only 28 percent to a total of 1483 
continuing efforts of denominations to reach out to this group 
will be a challenge to the existing programs of theological 
schools he said 
students of pacificasian ancestry have increased much more 
rapidly and their total of 2058 now exceeds that of blacks the 
determination of this group to provide an educated ministry is 
obvious baumgaertner said 
despite overall seminary growth the number of fulltime students 
continued to drop now totalling 36431 or 65 percent down 35 
percent in the last two years the proportion has declined 11 
percent in the last decade from 76 percent 
schools have been focusing their energies on increasing 
endowment for student financial aid in order to reverse this trend 
and to permit more applicants to become fulltime students 
baumgaertner said 
it is obvious that more needs to be done

jose espinosa fled fidel castros cuba in 1961 with 
10 in his pocket he now heads a 3 millionayear company that 
caters to latins by operating up to 15 buses daily between miami and 
new york 
english is a second language on espinosas la cubana buses 
except for the movies on the overhead vcr system that entertain 
riders traveling the 1300 miles on interstate 95 
like many cuban exiles espinosa settled in miami for what he 
thought would be a temporary stay 
after castro took over everybody i knew who came to miami 
agreed fidel would be out of power within months everybody was 
mistaken he said of the cuban strongman in power since 1959 
espinosa came to florida alone but was able to get his wife and 
young daughter out of cuba when it became apparent castros reign 
would not be short his parents and most other relatives eventually 
moved to miami too 
his business began with a simple notion that many of the cuban 
exiles who traveled between new york and miami to visit relatives or 
work feared using a carrier that conducted business only in english 
he saw that spanishspeaking people werent getting the service 
they need said espinosas daughter rosa theodorou manager of 
the companys new yorkarea branch office in union city nj 
but getting the bus business off the ground proved to be a 
decadelong fight espinosa applied for a permit from the interstate 
commerce commission but busgiant greyhound lines inc opposed him 
and the battle dragged on until 1978 when espinosa finally 
convinced the commission his line would be unique 
i proved to the commission judge that there was a market for 
my service that other companies werent providing he said our 
passengers were not like other passengers our passengers didnt 
speak english they couldnt talk to the drivers 
to make ends meet espinosa worked at a freightforwarding 
company unloading goods and driving trucks 
and he began shuttling passengers without a license in an old 
station wagon he picked up fellow exiles in miami at their doors 
before dawn drove all day and night to the new york area dropped 
them off and then reversed the whole trip within days 
it was so much work he said that was before i had the 
permit i wasnt supposed to do it but i needed to make a living 
espinosa likened his prelicense hustling to nicaraguan vendors 
new to the country who today sell fruit on the streets of miamis 
little havana section without a permit 
it was a way to bring some food to the home he said 
through wordofmouth his business grew he bought a van and 
attached a trailer to carry passengers possessions once weary 
from a long haul to new york and a quick turnaround he forgot to 
lock the trailer door only to discover in south carolina that the 
goods had been strewn somewhere earlier along i95 
he was on the road constantly to meet demand so espinosa 
expanded again buying a bus that he drove for years until singer 
andy williams purchased it for his tours his daughter said 
now the business is established and espinosa 71 no longer has 
to drive for a living he has about 25 employees including 
bilingual reservation clerks who answer phones in new york and 
miami cubana in step with the times has a tollfree 800number 
the company has at least two buses on the road daily between 
miamis little havana and new york and up to 15 traveling each day 
during the busiest season christmas and july 
i dont know why the latins pick july to spend the month in 
miami beach espinosa said with a laugh 
he advertises on spanish tv and radio in the miami and new 
yorknew jersey markets but cubana generates most of its traffic 
from satisfied customers 
they feel like theyre in a family atmosphere said ms 
theodorou 
passengers on a recent trip southward were unanimous in their 
praise 
i like the music and its a fun atmosphere said katia 
chamah 18 
but at 69 each way the trip isnt much cheaper than the lowest 
airfares some air carriers have restricted oneway fares between 
miami and the new yorkarea as low as 79 and greyhounds fares 
range from 68 to 99 one way 
many latins however fear flying said ruben dario lugo a miami 
security guard who boarded the bus at cubanas small storefront in 
manhattan even though the trip takes an entire day and sometimes 
longer if there are any breakdowns along the way 
the thing to remember is if this falls lugo said patting 
the seat of the bus on a recent journey it doesnt fall nearly as 
far as a plane 
added ms theodorou we tell them if you were on a plane and 
it broke down you wouldnt be here to tell us

killed roger rabbit tshirt 
avenging force a violent bgrade film about a secret white 
supremacist society involved in killings in louisiana comes on and 
again the bus quiets most passengers transfixed by the tv screen

a slim crescent of moon rises in the sky soon the bus exits at 
chevy chase md and heads into washington dc to pick up a 
family of four 
a lot of people travel with us because theyre afraid to fly 
says niebla whose bus was delayed by a breakdown on the previous 
run its not just the latins either we get some haitians too 
katia chamah 18 comes up front as we pass the lighted lincoln 
memorial and washington monument she and niebla 33 begin talking 
mostly in spanish they switch easily between the two languages 
she speaks of vacations her college studies and dreams of a 
career as a forensic psychologist niebla talks of fishing in the 
florida keys and serving in the us military 
we pass richmond va its been six hours on the road the seven 
children on board seem wellmannered and none of the adults are 
misbehaving 
cubanborn niebla says he fled to florida with his parents in 
1967 his father a schoolteacher had opposed fidel castro and 
been publicly scorned by the cuban government his mother helped the 
anticastro underground niebla says 
she used to stick ammo in her shirt and take it to people 
hiding out in the mountains he says 
the heads of the sleeping passengers bob in the night daylight 
comes in a light fog in southern georgia the bus pulls into a truck 
stop for breakfast outside jacksonville fla then its back on the 
road for the final run to miami 
at this point in the trip most of florida looks the same mile 
after mile of palmettoes palms and wild brazilian pepper trees 
the bus continues on to west palm beach where a few passengers 
are let off many of the remaining travelers order coffee 
sandwiches and pastries from the adjacent cuban diner 
weary most everyone is quiet when the bus pulls into the 
oneroom cubana terminal which has a faded map of cuba on one wall 
in the little havana section of miami 
niebla is rewarded by chamah with a bag full of tips she 
collected from he passengers as the bus pulled into miami hes 
greeted by his wife and one of his daughters who clings to him 
hes on the road so much his wife says wringing her hands

as a lesson in capitalism us policy on trade 
with moscow loses something in the translation in this case 
business doesnt come before pressure 
commercial decisions hinge on soviet behavior and on american 
politics not on the marketplace 
and consistency is not part of the package 
pressing soviet trade the old communist mikhail s gorbachev 
argued like a businessman the course that now suits his economic 
purpose he told political leaders in washington and business 
leaders in minneapolis and san francisco that if american traders 
and investors dont move quickly into newly opening soviet markets 
other interests will be there first 
that concerns administration officials but they also have to 
deal with political realities one of which is that congress will 
not agree to a new trade deal until moscow offers at least a gesture 
toward granting lithuania independence 
the trade agreement gorbachev took home from the summit was 
described by the white house as a symbol of support for soviet 
economic change but it is only a symbol it will not be completed 
any time soon 
the soviet parliament may put off until fall its final action on 
an emigration law president bush said must be enacted before he 
sends the trade deal to congress even when that step is taken the 
agreement is not going anywhere without some easing in gorbachevs 
economic crackdown on lithuania 
at same time a renewed grain sales agreement is taking effect 
without regard to kremlin behavior on lithuanias independence drive 
or anything else 
the fiveyear grain deal extends agreements dating from 1976 
us negotiators wanted that one it is an economic boon to the 
midwest it expands the business american farmers already are doing 
and putting it in any doubt would be politically perilous 
when thenpresident carter imposed a partial grain embargo in 
1980 to punish the soviet union for the invasion of afghanistan 
republicans denounced the step 
they said wheat should not have been made a diplomatic weapon 
argued that moscow would simply buy its grain elsewhere ronald 
reagan lifted the embargo shortly after he became president 
the trade agreement and the mostfavorednation tariff status 
gorbachev wants are new business and politically vulnerable with 
no domestic constituency involved the grain sales are big business 
with powerful us voting interests behind them soviet negotiators 
apparently didnt want to sign the grain deal unless the trade deal 
also was signed 
grain sales including wheat sold at subsidized prices account 
for most current us trade with the soviet union under the new 
agreement those sales are supposed to increase to 6 to 8 billion a 
year 
soviet exports to the united states did not reach 1 billion last 
year 
the trade agreement could open the path to greatly expanded 
commerce between the two powers although at this point the soviet 
union does not have much to sell its major us exports now are 
vodka caviar and furs all subject to steep tariffs that would be 
sharply reduced by mostfavorednation treatment 
the trade deal also would make it easier for us companies that 
want to do business in the soviet union 
gorbachevs bottom line was a businessmans theres money to be 
made and the people who get there first will do best 
we need some economic moves some economic steps now he said 
during the summit visit if america lags behind then others come 
in we want america to be in 
he argued his case for the trade deal to congressional leaders 
and in his summit sessions with bush who finally offered the 
gesture of a conditional agreement congressional critics called it 
a cavein on lithuania the senate had voted 7324 on may 1 for a 
resolution saying that there should be no trade agreement without an 
end to the economic crackdown on lithuania 
sen george j mitchell dmaine the majority leader said 
monday that bush clearly expected congress to do what he wouldnt 
do and tie trade to soviet moves toward lithuanian independence 
not only to free emigration the latter condition dates from 1974 
it was set by congress to press for emigration rights for soviet 
jews 
bush also faces a trade policy dispute over his renewal of 
favorable tariff terms for china despite its repression of democracy 
demonstrators and the killings in tiananmen square a year ago 
congressional critics are trying to block the extension but they 
probably lack the votes 
bush had said his action on china sent no message except that 
isolation is bad and economic development is good 
the us message on soviet trade terms isnt quite the same

these are halcyon days for fox broadcasting co 
in the latest nielsen ratings the television network that 
refuses to call itself one broke into the top 10 for the first time 
in its young life 
the simpsons was the no 4 show in the country last week 
married with children was no 11 and in living color 
placed 19th never before in its fouryear existence has fox placed 
three shows in the top 20 
at its annual convention this week for affiliated stations fox 
is beside itself 
so whats an upstart network to do 
well try not to let it go to your head for starters or at 
least dont let it look like its going to your head and when you 
roll out your fall schedule dont let it appear that youre going 
toetotoe with the big boys even though you are 
before about 600 advertisers affiliate representatives and 
reporters monday fox trotted out sneak peeks and the stars of its 
fall lineup 
out came keenen ivory wayans and his brother damon whose in 
living color skits include black gay limpwristed film reviewers 
giving movies two snaps up and the homeboy shopping network 
featuring two black thieves auctioning stolen goods 
also on the stage of the beverly hiltons versailles ballroom 
were two of the stars of the new babes situation comedy about a 
triumvirate of extremely large sisters who are well theyre 
fat and they make jokes about it 
there were fox executives talking about fox being unique 
special young and highoctane tv and about how with a 
recent federal communications commission waiver in hand the network 
has bumped its programming to 18 hours without being bound by 
federal network rules 
but probably the most talked about and written about aspect of 
the upcoming season is foxs decision to put the grousing animated 
simpsons up against kingpin bill cosby and the cosby show on 
nbc the simpsons actually placed four slots higher than cosby 
last week with both programs still in their original time periods 
on separate nights 
cos is gonna have a cow dude screamed last weeks headline 
in the la daily news foxs family feud wrote the san 
francisco chronicle 
but peter chernin head of the fox entertainment group says no 
way man the point is not to beat cosby the point is to walk into 
no mans land and settle for second 
well be happy to be no 2 chernin said monday in an 
interview at the beverly hilton 
because cosby has owned the 8 pm edt thursday slot for the last 
few years abc and cbs simply walked away chernin said and now 
with rumors abounding that the fall season will be cosbys last on 
the show fox strutted in with its toprated program 
if bill does leave after this year chernin said then 
well step in 
fox does not chernin said expect to beat cosby in the fall 
rather its just one more example of guerrilla warfare a 
phrase chernin is partial to using when describing his network uh 
make that broadcasting company 
with only 131 stations across the country carrying fox 
programming compared to toprated nbc which has 208 affiliate 
stations the success of fox really does seem like a guerrilla war 
couple that with the fact that its not always easy to find the 
fox station in your hometown especially if you live in say 
lexington ky where the fox affiliate is wdky located on channel 
56 
overcoming such obstacles is not lost on fox which spared no 
expense in wining and dining its affiliates 
fox is no longer an alternative the affiliates were told 
amid much fanfare now its an essential 
lest they get too carried away with themselves fox executives 
did try to put a mute in their hornblowing 
we believe in taking risks chernin told the packed ballroom 
next we believe in aggressiveness we cant afford to get 
comfortable weve got to keep challenging ourselves

television might make your brain cry out for 
sustenance but it could be worse for couch potatoes if it inspires 
them to down the same junk they see actors eating on tv shows at 
night 
no kidding thats the opinion of a study that analyzed the food 
content of 11 top network shows and almost burped in dismay 
the primetime diet is inconsistent with dietary guidelines for 
healthy americans says a summation of the study published in 
this months issue of the american journal of public health 
the study conducted in the summer of 1988 was designed to 
examine whether what we see eaten on tv has any impact on what we 
eat could be it concluded however it added this is 
speculative and further research is needed 
but the report makes clear that such goodforyou eats as wheat 
germ apples spinach fish and even the mighty banana get short 
shrift in prime time 
the study finds that 60 percent of all food references in the 
studied shows were for low nutrient beverages and sweets 
a big boo to you mr tv producer 
the food references dont include the 261 commercials found here 
and there in the shows but they too indicate tv has become munchy 
city 
the study says 35 percent of the ads were for food with 
fastfood wares hamburgers fried chicken pizza and breakfast 
sandwiches leading the pack 
the shows analzyed for their depictions of tv dining ranged from 
whos the boss to the golden girls from murder she wrote 
to alf 
even la law which often has a fruit bowl on its conference 
table to indicate the series is about a los angeles law firm got 
the gimlet eye 
all this analyzing proved a veritable tums festival finding that 
references to food occurred an average of 48 times per halfhour 
for a grand total of 134 food references for what its worth fish 
got only one mention but then so did muffins 
the report takes care to note that verbal references using food 
in a figurative sense such as referring to someone as the big 
cheese were not included 
moving right along now the study found 86 occasions of eating or 
drinking on the shows and much of that was as stage business 
stage business consists of such things as shuffling smoking an 
iguana crossing the eyes tapdancing or firing off a howitzer when 
the script is so dumb actors must do something to look busy 
almost threefourths of the food eaten on the shows are eaten 
between meals with sweets the most popular the study says 
sweets had a 44 percent consumption rate whereas fruits and 
vegetables had a combined total of only 9 percent 
the formaldining analysis included the category of entrees 
which among other things the study says consisted of stirfry 
vegetables and chicken which the children refused to eat 
lets hear it for the kids 
but their parents should turn off the tv set and make them read 
or take them to a play maybe something by shakespeare 
not twelth night though no one has conducted a food 
analysis of it but it does have a character who would be ideal to 
conduct such a study better yet he could have a go at the art of 
dining on tv 
his name is sir toby belch

in these riskaverse times many savers and 
investors are shopping for more than just high yields when they look 
for moneymarket investments 
by all the evidence they are paying extra attention these days 
to the fine distinctions among competing alternatives like treasury 
bills bank certificates of deposit and moneymarket mutual funds 
each of these popular savings vehicles enjoys a longstanding 
reputation for safety and nothing has happened lately to alter that 
description in any drastic way 
nevertheless many financial analysts say the relative merits of 
each species are getting a new appraisal these days in the wake of 
such developments as the government bailout of failed savings 
institutions and a general post1980s tightening of credit standards 
there is a flight to quality from bank cds and commercial paper 
shortterm debt issued by corporations into treasury bills says 
the savings newsletter 100 highest yields 
tbills which are sold by the federal government in threemonth 
sixmonth and oneyear maturities are widely considered to rank 
among the safest paper investments available anywhere in the world 
most bank cds also are governmentbacked in the form of deposit 
insurance of up to 100000 however the sampl crisis has prompted a 
debate over how far uncle sam can and ought to go in the future in 
standing behind the banking system 
investors in money funds have no direct government protection 
but the funds can strive for safety through diversification of their 
portfolios and sticking with securities of toprated borrowers 
including the treasury they also rank high in liquidity and 
convenience 
money funds have come under increased scrutiny in the past year 
however from both regulators and private commentators because of 
defaults by a couple of issuers of commercial paper 
in those instances sponsors of several money funds dug into 
their own pockets to make up for losses that would have at least 
marginally and temporarily reduced the funds yields 
this spring has brought a pause in what was a steady advance of 
moneyfund assets to record highs in april according to the 
investment company institute the total in shortterm mutual funds 
dropped to 4592 billion from 4636 billion the month before 
while payments of income taxes were partly responsible said 
jacob dreyer chief economist at the trade group he also said 
investors purchased large amounts of newly offered treasury bills 
and notes by drawing on their money market fund balances 
if this shift was inspired first of all by a safetyfirst 
philosophy it drew further encouragement from an unusual pattern in 
market rates yields on tbills which typically stand slightly 
lower than the competition right now are very competitive 
as of early this month listings in barrons magazine showed the 
yield on 26week treasury bills at 817 percent compared to 
sixmonth cds at an average of 775 percent and money market funds 
at an average of 768 percent 
it appears analysts say that banks and money funds have made 
some concessions toward safety in their usual competitive efforts to 
offer top yields 
whether of their own volition or in response to regulatory 
prodding they have tightened the standards they apply to the credit 
risks they are willing to take that generally means accepting a 
lower yield 
in addition tbill yields are not affected by the management and 
operating costs that take a slice out of the returns banks and money 
funds can offer 
savers and investors who buy tbills from a bank or broker may 
see their effective returns reduced by transaction charges or 
custodial fees new treasury securities can be bought with no such 
charges however by dealing directly with a federal reserve bank or 
branch

teachers at rosman elementary school had a 
bold plan to transform their school into a highly unusual learning 
center where parents and students could study side by side 
such a center they believed might help break the cycle of 
poverty and illiteracy in their appalachian community 
but like many good ideas it lacked an essential ingredient 
money 
thats changed since the tiny school became one of 15 across the 
nation awarded grants from the rjr nabisco foundations 30 million 
next century schools program the largest corporate educational 
grant program ever for the benefit of elementary and secondary 
schools 
rosman elementary with 364 students in grades k6 will receive 
750000 over the next three years as part of the tobacco and food 
giants program designed to promote daring even risky changes in 
education 
the rjr grant program was announced last year and winning 
schools got their first awards in april 
its a dream come true said exie henson who teaches second 
and third grade at rosman elementary 
the grant will be used to broaden the mission of the school to 
help kids by helping their parents many of whom have severe social 
economic and educational problems of their own 
thirtysix percent of our kids are considered highrisk said 
principal dawson hogsed and so many of them have parents who also 
dropped out 
the school will transform itself into a parentchild learning 
center complete with computers where single mothers can obtain 
quality child care while they take college courses 
parents who never learned to read will be able to take classes at 
the school they will be encouraged to come to the library any time 
day or night to spend time with a book with their children 
the school also will be a place where women including teenage 
girls can get quality prenatal care 
school officials envision a community center where people can get 
all kinds of assistance without having to drive 20 miles to the 
nearest large town 
our campus could be open 24 hours a day said hogsed 
more than 1000 schools applied for the rjr grants nine of the 
15 awards went to schools in washington dc north carolina and new 
jersey where the company has operations 
of course some of the new programs we fund wont work said 
roger semerad president of the rjr nabisco foundation but thats 
a risk we are willing to take because we understand that true 
innovation and creativity always entails risking failure 
among the other schools receiving grants the bell multicultural 
high school in washington dc will purchase stateoftheart 
technologies and extend the school year 
at stanley elementary school in kansas city kan teachers and 
students will stay together for a threeyear period with the idea 
that the longerthanusual contact will promote learning 
university terrace elementary school in baton rouge la will 
use its grant to involve parents in educational planning put 
students of different ages in the same class and free teachers from 
paperwork 
in portland ore davis elementary school will use the recess 
period and afterschool hours to teach students and their parents 
math skills 
this is not dogoodism rjr nabisco chairman and chief 
executive officer louis gerstner said when the grants were 
announced this is in my selfinterest as well as my employees 
gerstner said he expects some of the initiatives to fail because 
they represent such radical changes in public education 
rjr nabisco is in effect providing 30 million of venture 
capital to enable risk takers in education to break up the 
institutional gridlock that has stifled innovation and creativity

outside support he said 
at rosman the challenge will be convincing enough parents to use 
the planned new facility residents of this town like many mountain 
communities are fiercely proud when it comes to unsolicited offers 
of help 
the parents are intimidated said barbara hyatte who teaches 
highrisk students in the fifth and sixth grades i have a lot of 
trouble getting my parents to come in 
one out of five students at rosman comes from a singleparent 
home nearly 40 percent are poor enough to qualify for the free 
lunch program 
we did a survey of our students and we found that 30 percent 
have at least one parent who did not finish high school said 
hogsed thats 30 percent of the entire school not just the 
highrisk students and 55 percent of them had at least one 
grandparent who did not graduate 
the principal a native who attended rosman elementary and the 
high school right down the street and his faculty of 17 teachers 
hope to enhance the education of their students by addressing their 
social problems 
our parents provide for their kids by doing without 
themselves said hogsed we want them to help their children 
realize the importance of education

many real estate and building people feel a new 
scourge has been let loose upon the american economy regulators 
those regulators they feel are sometimes overzealous 
irritating intimidating and arbitrary and they wonder occasionally 
if the activities of regulators might not even tip the economy into 
recession 
while that possibility might seem farfetched at this point 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of home 
builders asks that very question in an analysis for an association 
publication 
and alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board 
pointedly has suggested to bankers that they remain prudent rather 
than reactionary 
many of the real estatebuilding critics now concede that there 
might not be a traditional credit crunch that the federal reserve 
might be right in saying there is enough money out there but they 
add a big but 
the big but is this isnt it the same thing as a credit 
crunch if the banks have the money and because of more critical 
supervision by regulatory officials or their own lending officers 
they are unwilling to lend it 
seiders says there is indeed a crunch a regulatory credit 
crunch 
on feb 8 for example the office of the comptroller of the 
currency or occ issued an advisory letter to chiefs and directors 
of all national banks entitled real estate project and development 
lending 
this letter cited fundamental deficiencies and negative 
trends in bank real estate lending during 1989 and warned about 
problems of loan underwriting appraisal practices and inadequate 
risk analysis 
the result says seiders was to throw a deep chill over the 
source of credit that we were counting on to help fill in for the 
thrifts which of course have their own regulatory and lending 
problems 
all of a sudden he says builders and developers from markets as 
diverse as new england virginia and california reported that banks 
have simply closed their real estate lending windows 
seiders says the banks explain that armies of supervisors have 
them so uptight that real estate lending is just not worth the pain 
when there are plenty of other investment alternatives 
despite official denials that a credit crunch exists the 
national association of realtors is just as certain there is based 
on member reports it routinely reports on the credit crunch in 
its publications 
it quotes its own chief economist john tuccillo as saying that 
poor financial practices of savings and loans have given rise to a 
new zeal among many banking regulators 
he suggests it isnt only the regulators involved in the 
crackdowns but lenders too fearful of the feds he says many 
lenders operate in a tense environment of selfregulation in short 
they avoid problems by not lending 
much of the regulatory zealousness originates with the savings 
and loan debacle and daily stories of commercial real estate loans 
gone bust in almost every such story regulators are criticized for 
not having done their jobs 
while there is little evidence that home mortgage delinquences 
are on an upward trend the residential market might also suffer 
realtor news a weekly publication quotes one realtor as explaining 
if you had a late payment somewhere or a delinquency lenders 
used to just ask for a letter of explanation but now they just say 
no

of board president the rev r keith parks in saying 
denominational controversy has hurt mission efforts 
the rev mark corts noting that parks charge came shortly 
before the denominations june 1214 convention said it fuels the 
controversy rather than rising above it 
the 15 millionmember denomination has been embroiled for a 
decade in a conflict between fundamentalists and moderates over the 
bible 
it may be unfair for the controversy to be the scapegoat for 
our failure corts said in a letter to state baptist weeklies

are not controversy and decline in missions support 
symptoms of our desperate need for revival and reformation the

the popular old orator raconteur author 
preacher and irrepressible optimist the rev norman vincent peale 
was back in the pulpit on turning 92 age hasnt dimmed his sparkle 
he had the packed sanctuary of his longtime pastorate the 
historic marble collegiate church rolling with intermittant gales 
of laughter applause and concentrated listening 
you believe in yourself he exhorted believe in god and 
believe in jesus and follow him and i say toyou you can do 
anything 
that was the core of his message laced with scripture passages 
and illustrative anecdotes and it has been the nub of his long 
career brimming with confidence and zest for life 
the power of postive thinking he titled his immensely 
successful 1952 book still reprinted and internationally 
circulated followed by 17 others mostly stressing selfassurance 
and faith as keys to accomplishment 
the theme runs through many of the titles such as the 
toughminded optimist enthusiasm makes the difference and 
you can if you think you can 
besides spreading encouragement in his books hes done it on the 
lecture circuit in broadcasts in a syndicated newspaper column 
confident living and in a pioneering center he founded linking 
psychiatry and religion 
it probably had the most extensive influence in bringing the 
two fields together said the rev arthur caliandro now marble 
collegiates regular pastor the whole area has now opened up much 
more 
the center the institute of religion and health started in 
1937 still functions with staff psychiatrists at the church peale 
and his wife ruth also edit an inspirational monthly guideposts 
with 4 million circulation 
it had been two years since he had preached at marble collegiate 
which he led for 52 years until 1984 but he was back at that old 
stand once again on sunday may 20 prior to his 92nd birthday may 
3l 
of his first sermon there in 1932 he said i was scared he 
paused grinning and im scared today but his voice was about 
as strong as ever his gestures sure his downhome midwestern 
charm flashing 
when first called as pastor of the church he said it had been 
without a minister for three years another pause they called 
me because i was better than nothing 
laughter at that and other points sprinkled the hour caliandro 
once described peale as a loving laughing shepherd who made 
it fun to be in church 
peale eying his wife in a pew said that when he met and married 
her in 1930 she was acknowledged to be the prettiest girl in 
syracuse university and shes prettier now to the applauding 
congregation he added 
she still he paused how shall i say it shes still 
the most beautiful woman in new york state more applause 
gallantly he amended with the exception of all the women 
present laughter 
i got out of that pretty good didnt i he said more 
laughter 
thats how it went throughout peales 45minute sermon threaded 
with cheer and thoughtfulness his recollections homey sentiments 
stories and his masterfully timed phrasing still in sync 
easy and folksy as ever the ohioborn peale told a string of 
hilarious sometimes lessonpointing tales among the hymns that 
sunday was peales favorite be still my soul 
preaching on psalm 34 about a man who sought the lord and was 
delivered from all his fears and troubles peale said god stands 
ready to deliver you from all fears not some of them all of 
them 
peale seasonsed his sermon with quips and personal tales one 
about a personality development rally in columbus ohio 
involving a highly successful businessman who had risen from poverty 
asked how he had been so wonderfully successful the 
businessman said he believed in god in himself and in his job and 
had immersed myself in the bible there is wisdom in there in 
order to succeed i needed wisdom 
peale added that the bible is full of wisdom ive lived a long 
time and the bible never once failed me or let me down 
he told of a tiny 4foot11 woman who worked for the late new 
york mayor fiorello la guardia and who once in an elevator 
complained to him she couldnt do much because she was so small 
peale quoted la guardia as telling her young lady you listen 
to me im going to tell you something and i know what im talking 
about you trust god and believe in yourself and you can do 
anything 
as he left the elevator she noticed that the 5foot2 la guardia 
was short too but as he disappeared down the hall i saw he was 
a giant of a man 
so are you peale told his listeners by trusting god 
following jesus and believing in yourself he said you can do 
anything

vladimir zhironovsky chairman of the liberal 
democrats conducts interviews on a park bench not in an office 
his party couldnt afford an office even if one were available 
we dont have any money we dont have any press we dont have 
any advertising he said on the bench in a quiet shady corner of 
sokolniki park in northeast moscow 
nikolai travkin a plainspoken former communist party member who 
is forming a populist movement incites disgruntled citizens to 
throw out his former comrades the russian social democrats are 
looking for coalition partners and communists need not apply 
dozens of parties have formed since the communists and the 
national legislature agreed in february to end the partys monopoly 
on power the political spectrum ranges from monarchist to 
anarchist but the communist party remains dominant 
communist reformer vyacheslav n shostakovsky said the newcomers 
present a sideshow of protoparties while a struggle for control 
goes on in the 19million member organization that has ruled the 
soviet union since 1917 
travkin agrees what counts is not the number of parties but 
their ability to mount a nationwide challenge to the communists 
you can create as many parties as you want but the communist 
party will strangle them like chickens he told supporters at a 
rally 
in pressing for an end to the constitutional monopoly of power 
president mikhail s gorbachev said the communists would struggle 
for the status of the ruling party rather than having it 
guaranteed 
whatever the theory the party still controls newspapers radio 
and television 
it has lost none of the vast staff and organizational experience 
built up over 70 years and party cells in factories ministries 
the military and kgb secret police have not been eliminated 
opponents of the communists have none of those advantages but 
also lack the partys big disadvantage a legacy of repression and 
mismanagement that is an easy target to attack 
oleg rumyantsev said his social democrats are morally and 
politically opposed to the ideology and practical ways of 
revolutionary communism epitomized by the bolsheviks the party 
will consider a coalition with anyone except the communists he told 
the interfax news service 
zhironovsky of the liberal democrats is a lawyer and proponent of 
free markets who has spent years on the edge of the dissident 
movement 
he believes the soviet communists are going the way of eastern 
europes failed regimes 
the question is how they are going to leave and when he 
said 
many prominent people criticize the communist party but forcing 
it out will not be easy 
no big names have joined the small opposition groups telephones 
and apartments are so scarce there is no place for zhironovsky to 
put the liberal democrat headquarters so he splits it between his 
apartment and his office at a publishing house 
he hopes that in the interests of political stability the 
communists will decide to hand over some of their plentiful office 
space without a regular headquarters he said it is impossible for 
his 9000member group to maintain regular contacts even with 
legislators 
lawmakers have a mass of other problems and theyre going to 
spend two or three days looking for me he asked 
the communist reformer shostakovsky said small parties do not 
yet pose a serious challenge and the main contest is between 
reformers and conservatives within the communist party 
there are monarchists in the party as strange as it seems and 
there are anarchists said shostakovsky rector of moscows higher 
party school he is a leader of democratic platform reformers who 
want the party leadership to abandon the idea of leading and 
organizing the entire society 
other members include boris n yeltsin just elected president of 
the russian federation historian yuri afanasiev and gavriil popov 
mayor of moscow 
some kind of party split is almost certain a struggle now is 
under way for control of the party center and with it the majority 
of members 
shostakovsky fears an attempt to seize control by party 
hardliners who accused gorbachevs economic advisers in documents 
published may 13 of intending to dismantle soviet socialism they 
condemned private enterprise legalization of accumulating 
capital thirst for profit and individualism 
a national party central committee document criticized democratic 
platform this spring for threatening to split the party if it cannot 
force reform the differences probably will come to a head at the 
28th party congress beginning july 1 and it is not certain what 
direction gorbachev will take 
shostakovsky said he did not expect gorbachev to propose great 
changes if none occurred he said democratic platform would leave 
and take 500000 to 600000 supporters along 
it would be the largest opposition group by far but still a 
dwarf beside the mother party 
despite the prominence of many of its members democratic 
platform would face many of the difficulties confronted by other 
opposition groups most of its supporters are intellectuals and 
highly skilled workers and shostakovsky acknowledged it had 
virtually no support in the countryside 
democratic platform probably would cooperate with gorbachev as 
much as possible playing the role of a loyal opposition rather than 
trying to take power away from him 
travkin whose populist message has found an audience with 
radical workers has been a member of democratic platform and still 
has a partnership relationship with it shostakovsky said 
he added however that travkin was pressing too hard there is 
a taste of confrontation about it extremely tough confrontation 
he said 
as for travkin he said his populist party which does not yet 
have a name wants to replace local communist leaders not engage in 
endless round tables to negotiate issues 
shostakovsky said opponents may be surprised by the communists 
staying power 
they have watched sovietinspired parties in eastern europe 
quickly reduced to demoralized minority parties he said but 
communism was imposed there and was homegrown in the soviet union

on most nights the nightingale the 
flying carpet and the king clamber along the rocky smugglers trail 
in the foothills of mount hermon between lebanon syria and israel 
carrying american cigarettes scotch whisky and electrical 
appliances for syria on their backs they run the gantlet of syrian 
and israeli soldiers dug in along a front that threads across the 
snowcapped 9200foot mountain 
on the return leg they carry diesel fuel from iran and other 
goods that are prized in lawless lebanon where civil war began in 
1975 and central authority collapsed long ago 
the nightingale the flying carpet and the king are mules 
specially trained for the sixhour trek on and around mount hermon 
where the borders of lebanon syria and israel intersect 
because of their special skills each mule is worth about 3000 
twice the average for a pack animal in southeast lebanon those 
skills include recognizing and running from anyone in military 
uniform and leading pack trains of up to 100 mules 
its a nomans land out there said adnan daher a 
16yearold smuggler the israelis are on a hill to the west the 
syrians on a hill to the east and lebanon behind us 
no accurate figures on the smuggling trade are available but 
diplomats in syria say it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars 
a year 
shebaa a predominantly sunni moslem town in the israelioccupied 
sector of south lebanon has been a smugglers haven for decades 
the men of shebaa have traditionally defied authority 
about 5000 of shebaas original population of 200000 still live 
there said mohammed zoheiri a sprightly man of 90 who has been 
mukhtar or mayor for 45 years 
the others went to beirut other parts of lebanon or the oilrich 
persian gulf states because work opportunities are scarce here 
zoheiri said whlle sipping tea with visitors 
he said the mulers as he calls them have known no other 
way of making a living they were born on muleback 
some of his 40 grandsons are mulers as his own father was 
zoheiri said and added its shebaas profession 
over the border in syria is sirghaya the nerve center of syrian 
smugglers where half the 15000 people live off the contraband 
business 
theyd have to arrest the whole town if they wanted to stop 
us said a merchant in nearby madaya the main outlet for the 
smuggled goods he was unwrapping highheeled italian shoes that had 
just crossed the frontier 
although it costs money in lost tax revenue diplomats say the 
illegal trade also helps the troubled syrian economy 
a recent report by the us embassy in damascus said the 
offthebooks economy is both a sore point and a salvation the 
black market provides badly needed goods and in many ways keeps the 
economy going 
because of the steady flow of contraband the planners of syrias 
socialist economy do not have to divert precious foreign exchange 
for imports president hafez assads government generally turns a 
blind eye as long as the trade keeps to border towns 
diplomats in damascus said there even was a sizable illicit trade 
in goods from israel through the israelioccupied zone in south 
lebanon 
iron reinforcing bars and other building materials are 
particularly prized in syria the us embassy report said syrian 
construction workers would be out of jobs but for smuggled 
building materials 
daher the 16yearold smuggler from shebaa said after a recent 
nocturnal expedition we provide whatever our syrian partners 
demand 
he said the shebaa men hand over their loads to syrian mule 
trains 
each mule carries about 100 kilograms or 220 pounds each 
smuggler owns two mules and clears about 100 a week four times the 
average wage in lebanon 
syrian soldiers usually start intercepting us after the snow 
melts said a smuggler who identified himself only as ahmed we 
move to another unloading spot close to the israelicontrolled hill 
the syrians dont go there 
a few days earlier a syrian customs patrol fired on a pack train 
from shebaa and killed a mule but the smugglers escaped with the 
rest of their animals 
shebaa smugglers have 600 to 800 mules said amin a 51yearold 
who has been in the trade since boyhood 
its a dangerous profession but shebaas smugglers rarely get 
killed he said we know our way and the lead mules are well 
trained 
most shebaa men killed in recent years were victims of land 
mines he said 
amin said it takes up to three months to train a lead mule which 
should be big strong healthy and smart 
a mule chosen as a leader is kept in an isolated dark stable 
without food or water for two days he said 
then a man who shouldnt be a smuggler because the mule would 
get used to his smell goes in dressed as a soldier and beats the 
mule with a stick amin said a smuggler goes in after him and 
gives the mule food and water he said the soldier fires a 
rifle near the mule during the beating the soldier becomes the 
mules enemy he explained and the animal tries to escape the 
minute a soldier is seen or a bullet is fired at this point the 
mule becomes eligible to lead a caravan

dermot finucane northern ireland 
jailbreaker and ira gunman wanted by britain is enjoying a fine 
dublin summer savoring freedom and drawing welfare checks 
its a great victory said finucane 29 who has spent most 
of his adult life in jail or on the run for someone suddenly to 
say youre free its also frightening and bewildering and 
wonderful at the same time 
to the british government his freedom is infuriating and the 
reasons are disturbing 
in march the irish supreme court refused to extradite finucane 
to britishruled northern ireland it said his offense of possessing 
weapons was politically inspired since the irish republican army is 
fighting to unite ireland 
the five judges added that finucane probably would be beaten by 
prison guards if returned to the jail from which he escaped in 1983 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain called the ruling 
deeply offensive and said it encouraged terrorists to the view 
that they will probably find a safe haven in the republic of 
ireland 
disputes over extradition have long clouded relations between the 
two countries but things reached a new low after finucane and an 
ira comrade james clark walked free march 13 into the arms of 
jubilant supporters both were convicted in northern ireland and 
sentenced to 18year prison terms 
prime minister charles haugheys fianna fail party political 
heirs of the irish nationalist heroes who wrested independence from 
britain in the 1920s is instinctively opposed to handing irish 
people over to the british 
the ira is dedicated to overthrowing the institutions governing 
the irish republic as well as british rule in northern ireland 
ireland like britain outlaws the organization and keeps its 
supporters off radio and television 
extradition remains a problem however because of the deeply 
rooted belief that an irish nationalist will not get fair treatment 
from the british 
in the past year british appeal judges have quashed the 
convictions of four irish people jailed for ira bombings in britain 
in 1974 and three who were accused of plotting to assassinate a 
british government minister 
six irishmen serving life sentences for a 1974 bombing in 
birmingham that killed 21 people have won widespread support for 
their campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted 
it all reinforces widespread unease about the conduct of court 
cases in britain in which irish people are charged with terrorist 
offenses said columnist mary holland of the irish times which 
opposes the ira 
among those who got away is a roman catholic priest patrick 
ryan the irish attorney general refused his extradition on 
terrorism charges in 1988 declaring british politicians and 
newspapers had damned ryan in such intemperate language that a fair 
trial was impossible 
britain and other irish political parties are putting pressure on 
haughey to amend the extradition laws critics want it spelled out 
that such crimes as murder or possessing weapons cannot be deemed 
political 
the idea that such barbarism should somehow be construed as a 
form of political action is nauseating and immoral and cannot 
continue said desmond omalley leader of the progressive 
democrats the fianna fails junior coalition partner 
recent bombings in london have increased the pressure on haughey 
the british say the attacks herald a summer onslaught in mainland 
britain as part of the ira campaign to unite protestantdominated 
northern ireland with the overwhelmingly catholic republic 
haughey says a 1987 act curtailing the plea of political 
motivation will do away with the present difficulties he tells 
critics to wait and see how the courts apply the 1987 statute which 
incorporates the european convention on the suppression of terrorism 
our extradition laws are amongst the best in the world he 
told fianna fails annual convention soon after finucane was 
released 
also however delegates endorsed a resolution opposing any 
extraditions to northern ireland and britain in present 
circumstances it said suspects should be tried instead under the 
republics antiterrorist laws 
although finucanes case predates the 1987 act some critics say 
his release has undermined it and is good news for five northern 
ireland fugitives fighting extradition under the stricter law 
cases still take a year or more to grind through appeals and 
scope remains in the 1987 act for fighting extradition on political 
grounds 
since 1972 britain has made 112 applications for extradition of 
security offenders northern ireland officials say with seven 
granted 41 refused and five still being fought the rest lapsed 
to northern irelands unionists the protestant majority ireland 
looks like a haven for their terrorist foes the british feel let 
down because improved extradition procedures were supposed to be 
the reward for giving ireland a say in the running of northern 
ireland under the 1985 angloirish agreement 
irelands progressive democrats began a campaign may 14 to 
toughen the extradition law and found the opposition fine gael and 
labor parties generally supportive 
it is a huge scandal that that man finucane goes free 
party president michael mcdowell a lawyer said in an interview in 
the library of his home 
i know how i would feel if i were a unionist in northern 
ireland watching someone like finucane a convicted terrorist 
kicking his heels safe and free 
at the downtown headquarters of sinn fein the iras legal 
political front finucane retorted how does a nationalist feel 
when a british soldier walks free after murdering one of us 
finucane is one of eight children of a working class family in 
belfast and says his early memories are of his home being burned 
down by protestants 
growing up in a catholic ghetto he learned to hate the british 
and the local mainly protestant security forces 
as kids we played the ira and british troops finucane said 
you learned that if we didnt protect ourselves no one would 
at 17 he was arrested and he says beaten by british army 
interrogators soon afterward he crossed the line from hurling 
gasoline bombs in street riots to carrying an ira gun 
he married in 1980 and has a 9yearold daughter with whom he 
never has spent more than two weeks at a time 
in 1981 police captured finucane and two other ira men in a car 
chase after an attack on an army patrol in belfasts anderstontown 
district their weapons were in the car 
finucane was sentenced to 18 years in prison 
he joined a mass breakout from northern irelands maze prison in 
1983 and fled south to the republic irish security forces picked 
him up during a series of raids on suspected safe houses in 1987 
his brother patrick a lawyer who defended ira suspects was shot 
to death and protestant militants claimed responsibility another 
brother gerard is in an irish jail for ira activity and john 
finucane was killed in an auto accident en route to an ira operation

just after the titles for another 48 hrs two highway patrol 
officers and the bartender of a remote desert tavern are blasted 
pointblank by a trio of neanderthal bikers that pretty much sets 
the tone for the second of the heavyartillery movies this violent 
movie summer 
the first was total recall with arnold schwarzenegger as the 
main marksman coming soon are dick tracy robocop 2 and 
die hard 2 
few sequels have followed the pattern of the original as closely 
as another 48 hrs once again reggie hammond eddie murphy is 
in prison framed according to him jack cates nick nolte the 
loose gun of the san francisco police department is once more in 
trouble with his bosses as he continues his pursuit of the 
iceberg mastermind of a dope ring reggie is released and 
kicking and screaming becomes cates accomplice 
several gimmicks are repeated from 48 hrs reggies singing 
to james brown tapes on his walkman a donnybrook in a western bar 
but then the filmmakers must have concluded why tamper with 
success 
within the first 15 minutes the bikers shoot jack cates in the 
chest and then try to assassinate reggie while hes riding in a bus 
the pace never slackens thereafter 
walter hill who repeats as director is one of the best 
practitioners of nonstop action and he fills the screen with 
compelling images he favors closeups of shoes walking toward a 
shootout neon shimmering on wet streets bodies crashing through 
picture windows one bad guy falls from a building and lands on a 
truckload of fivegallon water bottles 
when bodies arent being blasted reggie and cates engage in 
shouting matches their repartee fortunately is brightly written by 
john fasano jeb stuart and larry gross and delivered with total 
relish by murphy and nolte of all the bickering partners in 
fighting crime they are the best 
another 48 hrs doesnt pause for romantic interest no time 
for that if the final unmasking of the iceman isnt much of a 
surprise thats ok the movie is meant to be existential 
after a few films unworthy of his talent eddie murphy returns to 
form with what he plays best the fasttalking survivor in a hostile 
world nick nolte also shines in a role tailored to his shambling 
frame the supporting cast which includes bernie casey as murphys 
convict friend and tisha campbell as his daughter is highly 
effective 
lawrence d wachs and lawrence gordon produced the paramount 
pictures release which is rated r for language and excessive 
violence running time 95 minutes

in 1984 ellen altmanns boss at laguardia 
hospital told her she was spending too much time assisting a man who 
had aids the physicians were angry with her and worried she was 
going to catch the disease by being in the same room with him so 
often 
so she did the only thing she felt she could do 
when i handed in my resignation ellen said i told them 
ive decided to work exclusively with patients with aids 
her supervisor was astounded what are you crazy arent you 
afraid you want to have a family someday youre going to catch 
something 
im not afraid ellen said im just not ignorant 
since the time before aids had a name ellen and ed altmann have 
built their professional and sometimes personal lives around 
caring for people with the fatal incurable disease they are both 
nurses colleagues for seven years spouses for five taking on the 
job it seemed at times no one else wanted 
aids is especially nursings disease said ellen 32 now the 
head nurse for the newly opened aids unit at lenox hill hospital on 
manhattans upper east side i could work in a doctors office i 
could work in a lab i could work in surgery i could work in 
maternalchild health where a lot of things are mostly happy 
but i think this is really the essence of nursing 
if aids is nursings disease as the altmanns believe it is 
because medical technology has made so little headway against it 
nursing care can make a difference can help keep a person with the 
fullblown disease out of the hospital 
but few drugs have any impact on the inexorable ravages of the 
virus 
i think this is a particularly insane profession very 
strenuous where youre always facing insurmountable odds said 
ed 36 who works in the nursing end of aids research running drug 
trials for the community research initiative 
working in a field like this keeping that separation between 
personal and professional keeping some control over your life it 
really is a skill a lot of people do burn out but to stay in 
it you really have to develop those boundaries for yourself 
there have been many times in their lives when the boundaries 
between their personal and professional lives have disappeared lost 
in their passion for their cause 
after ellen resigned she and ed went to st clares a small 
aging roman catholic hospital tucked into manhattans tough hells 
kitchen neighborhood 
there in the citys first dedicated aids unit they worked 
14hour days creating what would become a model for other hospitals 
the two of them were the entire nursing staff a pair with 
distinctly different yet complementary styles shes intense 
matteroffact a doer who exudes confidence and competence hes 
more easygoing a lowkey observer who seems quietly selfassured 
they also were newlyweds spending 24 hours a day together 
supporting each other fighting the tough fight and loving it 
we spent more time together working than we ever have ellen 
said we were fighting for a cause together something we were 
both committed to 
it was a tremendous task and a thankless job ed said but 
by doing it by putting ourselves in that situation we got the 
opportunity to learn how the system really works how to start a new 
program and make it fit into a hospital thats very resistant to 
change 
at first the doctors wouldnt come to their floor the 
housekeepers wouldnt come the xray technicians wouldnt come the 
kitchen served patients meals on paper trays the fear was palpable 
gradually that changed as the years passed staffers who had 
resented mandatory aids education classes that ellen taught began 
asking for them what never changed was the relative youth of the 
patients many of them vital people at the height of their careers 
and the inevitability of their deterioration we both ended up 
getting involved with special patients who for one reason or 
another became very close to us ellen said we were able to 
support each other through their deaths 
as patients have become their friends over the years so some of 
their friends have become patients 
for months the altmanns took turns nursing a friend who required 
daily care they were the only ones he would allow administer his 
twicedaily intravenous medication 
either ed or ellen would visit him in the morning before work 
and the other would come in the evening they kept their home 
stocked with iv supplies in case he was visiting their queens 
neighborhood 
we never made any plans that didnt include seeing him or 
communicating with him in some way ellen said we restricted 
our lives based on how he was feeling because we always wanted to 
be available 
it was really stressful and there were times we were angry we 
shouldnt have gotten so involved but how could we not she 
said adding that their care helped the friend avoid two or three 
hospitalizations he died in january 
i dont regret any of it ellen said even though at times 
it seemed overwhelming for him to be so dependent on us and us to 
have all our social plans revolved around his care i would not have 
done it any differently 
still the days are gone when they would unhesitatingly dedicate 
every spare minute to aids care with little thought to their 
personal lives now ed spends two days a week at home with their 
20monthold son joshua and ellen makes it a point to work regular 
hours and spend evenings and weekends with her family 
but the nature of their work the intensity of the demands the 
inevitability of death means they always will need to look to each 
other for special support 
when youre talking to a friend who is not a nurse and they 
ask what do you do i cant possibly answer that ellen said 
i can talk to you for weeks and weeks and weeks and you still 
wouldnt understand all the things i do as a nurse and ed 
understands 
sometimes ed said just a couple of words and i know 
exactly what shes going through

at the age of only 10 tony heard the words that 
pierced his heart and changed his world forever he wasnt wanted 
anymore his adoptive parents were giving him back 
the couple who had raised tony for nearly half his life said he 
didnt bond with them and was a disturbed child who abused and 
endangered his 8yearold brother sam 
their decision keep one boy return the other 
i was crying and i was very sad tony said in a tape 
recording made for the couple after he moved out i was adopted 
before and i dont like being pushed around by people 
while most adoptions in america succeed tonys case is among the 
small number that dont have a storybook ending just the pain and 
strain of a child and adults who share little but feelings of 
frustration and failure 
normally its a very traumatic experience said joe kroll 
director of the north american council on adoptable children it 
definitely tears at both sides youre losing a child a child is 
losing the parent 
tony whose legal fight to visit his biological brother captured 
national attention has turned the spotlight on failed adoptions 
stirring debate over the responsibility of prospective parents and 
the rights of children when forging family ties 
it creates new legal questions on some of the most 
difficult kinds of cases in the law because they really do hit you 
where you live said dan polsby a northwestern university law 
professor 
family law issues are characteristically gutwrenchers he 
said 
some argue adoption is an ironclad forbetterorworse 
commitment 
this is not something you go into thinking if it doesnt work 
we can always undo it said hal gaither a texas family court 
judge who has handled failed adoptions a child should not be 
treated like commodities that can be changed 
were talking about a human being were not talking about an 
automobile that youre tired of said pat murphy the cook county 
public guardian who represented tony in a court fight settled in 
late may when the adoptive parents agreed to sibling visits how 
many abandonments can you take in life before it really starts to 
kill you 
but others contend biological parents sever ties with children 
so adoptive families should have the same option 
there are lots of natural families who decide theyre going 
to terminate their parental rights said mary martin the attorney 
who represented tonys adoptive parents 
many legal experts say that rarely happens with older children 
however because the state and agencies are reluctant to accept 
them knowing they arent good adoption prospects 
lawyers also say parents generally dont reject adoptive children 
unless conditions are unbearable ripping apart families and 
marriages 
still there are exceptions murphy cited one couple who divorced 
and fought over the property but returned the child and another in 
which the father who was close to his adoptive son died and his 
wife returned the boy 
tonys adoptive parents known only as joseph and pamela doe a 
butcher and hairdresser from suburban bellwood said they couldnt 
cope any longer with the boys emotional problems and abuse of sam 
they claimed tony struck sam cut him and tried to drown him 
he certainly was doing things that were putting incredible 
pressure on them trying to live together as family ms martin 
said 
but murphy calls tony extremely likable engaging and notes 
psychologists say the parents were too rigid 
both boys were adopted in 1984 after being rejected twice by 
their natural mother who kept their sister 
as for tony he was shocked when his adoptive parents announced 
hed be returned to the state i thought they were kidding they 
werent he said on the tape made with friends last winter 
the couple refused to listen to his plaintive message according 
to murphy 
tonys plight engendered much sympathy in fact ms martin said 
the adoptive father told her if hed heard this story years ago i 
would have thought isnt that awful but you have to live in my 
shoes these last six years to know how you come to this point and 
how painful it is 
few adoptions end so tragically 
of some 50000 adoptions annually experts say less than 2 
percent fail but for specialneeds children those who are older 
or handicapped the rate is between 11 percent and 13 percent and 
nearly one in four for adolescents and teenagers 
marriages have a 50 percent failure rate said bill pierce 
president of the national committee for adoption in adoptions 
the fact we have a 13 percent failure rate is an astounding 
success 
some say however that rate may climb because healthy white 
babies are scarce while the adoption pool largely consists of older 
children with histories of neglect or abuse or infants born of 
addicted mothers 
the reason you might have more children who dont work out is 
were trying with tougher and tougher kids said adoption advocate 
kroll today every kind of kid has been adopted kids without 
arms or legs sexually abused those in foster homes twenty years 
ago they were written off 
a home though isnt an instant formula for success 
experts say adoptions fail for several reasons age handicaps 
parents cant handle lack of personal history and unrealistic 
expectations with some children harboring fantasies about 
idealized family life and some adults becoming disappointed when the 
children arent grateful or relieved to have a new home 
a study of 927 children 3 years and older adopted from 198084 in 
california found age was the strongest predictor of disruption and 
that the less information families had the likelier the problems 
said richard barth one of the authors and an associate professor at 
the university of californiaberkeleys social welfare school 
lack of access to personal files prompted a texas lawsuit by 
several families who claimed they werent told of their adoptive 
childrens histories of sexual abuse or physical problems 
thus far the federal courts have ruled against the parents who 
wanted the files to help their childrens treatment 
in a different adoption trauma in texas a couple gave up their 
adopted baby daughter after discovering she was severely mentally 
retarded and deciding they couldnt cope with that 
judge gaither who terminated their visitation rights but refused 
to end all parental obligations is not sympathetic 
a birth parent has to take what theyre given he said a 
lot of birth parents are saddled with problems that will never be 
solved 
tony now lives in a foster home 
in his taped message he was reassuring you dont have to 
worry about me because im doing fine and i miss you a lot he 
said he signed off as your loving friend and parttime son 
one of tonys buddies offered an epilogue saying when he heard 
what happened i started to cry i said well buddy im sorry 
you have to do this but this is life

the great majority of adoptions in america even those involving 
older or disabled children succeed but a small number of cases 
fail sometimes the parents cant cope other times the child

when rhonda and dan stanton adopted little stacey they thought 
the next 20 years of their lives would be devoted to nurturing 
raising and loving their daughter 
after years of being unable to conceive the texas couple finally 
had a child a soft sweetsmelling newborn girl no genie could 
have granted them a greater wish 
that promise soon turned to pain as stacey grew the couple 
learned she was severely mentally retarded they anguished they 
cried then they gave her up because mrs stanton said i just 
didnt have what it takes to cope with that 
the stantons became aware of staceys problems months after 
adopting her from a private agency in 1986 the child looked alert 
but something didnt seem quite right she began having eye 
problems she didnt cry 
the couple took her to the best doctors and therapists then 
mrs stanton recalled came a brutal assessment from a neurologist 
he said her brain stopped growing at nine months go home and 
grieve men do it different from women try not to fight with each 
other 
afterwards mrs stanton placed a sleeping stacey in the car 
thinking my beautiful little baby had died 
the stantons were torn wondering how they could keep stacey but 
how they could give her up for six months we died every single 
minute of every single day she said we laid on the floor and 
cried 
they gave her up mrs stanton said objecting to any suggestion 
they returned her shes not shoes or groceries 
in 1989 a judge ended the stantons visitation rights and 
suspended their financial obligations but refused to terminate 
parental rights that will happen if stacey now 3 and in a foster 
home is adopted 
the stantons say some folks have branded them cowards we feel 
terribly terribly guilty she said nobody knows how this just 
kills us 
she was the greatest joy and the most special love of our life 
there was no love like that love its like a giant hole in my 
heart a real shattered heart time wont ever completely mend this 
we still miss her incredibly

one of arlynn leiber pressers early childhood memories is the 
day she said goodbye to her mother and embarked on a new life in a 
new house with new parents 
its one thing to be put up for adoption when youre a day 
old she said at 3 years old you think my god what did i 
do what kind of horrible child was i 
ms pressers childhood years were turbulent with some joyful 
moments mostly in school and many more unhappy ones at home she 
says she never made many friends never went to the movies never 
felt like she belonged 
when her adoptive parents gave parties she says she often was 
asked to make a little speech im specially adopted of all the 
people my parents could have chosen they chose me im very lucky 
 
in some ways she now says all of us recognized i really 
wasnt their child 
ms presser says she was harshly punished ran away several times 
as an adolescent was kicked out and was committed to a psychiatric 
unit finally when she was about 15 years old she legally severed 
ties with her adoptive parents 
i really thought they were horrible people the chicago 
lawyer and freelance writer said i still feel that i feel like 
they bit off more than they could chew 
as an adult ms presser 29 tracked down her biological 
parents who divorced shortly after giving her up for adoption 
shes now happily married with two stepchildren and a 2yearold 
son but there are scars 
i felt enormously like i had done something terribly wrong 
she said this is a feeling i still have years later everybody 
else sitting in this world has parents who just adore them and fight 
like mother tigers when anything threatens them i failed at being a 
kid 
i look at the adoration i have for my son now she said i 
dont think that anybody looked at me with so much love as i look at 
my son with when he watches sesame street i watch it when he 
walks in a puddle i walk in it i feel like i live my childhood 
through him

susan tom still keeps a heartshaped box she received many years 
ago as a mothers day gift its a bittersweet reminder of one of 
the saddest experiences in her life

her daughter a dream that never came true the toms decided not to 
make permanent the adoption and the 9yearold left the toms home 
in fairfield calif after almost a year with them

had to tell her and i took her back the next day although she cried 
and i cried she never said ill change she had given 
up

now i would probably ride it out said ms tom a 42yearold 
single mother of six i was fairly naive at the time and did not 
have the support system that i now have i have learned there are 
probably things i should have done there are people i could have 
called

bonnie hudson mother of 13 is an optimist who doesnt like to 
give up on any child but when it came to her adopted son robert 
it was give up or destroy her family 
the hudsons already had adopted four special needs children when 
they welcomed a boy from india he had serious physical handicaps 
they didnt know about his tormented past was a surprise too 
robert they learned was in jail in india before the orphanage 
he was a clever pickpocket and had been sexually abused at 
knifepoint as a child 
so when robert began stealing and lying months after his arrival 
mrs hudson who was adopted as a child told him we want you to 
know its never too late for any human being to change as long as 
there is life and breath 
eighteen months later came a shocking discovery robert who was 
probably 12 years old not 9 as theyd been told had been sexually 
abusing three of their daughters two of them infants one a 
mentally slow firstgrader 
i wanted to kill him its beyond anger its rage said mrs 
hudson who asked that her and her adopted sons real names not be 
used there was no history to let us know this little guy could 
not be trusted in a household with a younger child 
the hudsons tried therapy switching schools having him watched 
constantly even locking him up in a psychiatric ward where mrs 
hudson said he sexually abused boys he couldnt promise to 
reform and he couldnt promise to control himself she added 
back home the fears mounted mrs hudson worried robert would 
set fire to their house 
this is the kind of kid who couldnt accept love in a family 
life its like catching a wild lion and saying you dont have to 
hunt and kill for your food 
after six years it snapped in my head for the sake of 
rehabilitating one you may lose the whole family she said 
in 1987 robert insisted they legally end the adoption he told 
me i would rather be on the streets in india begging than living 
with this family she said even the judge said this isnt 
going to work i kept saying ive never given up on a human being 
in my life 
i cried for three months i never failed with a kid said 
mrs hudson who lives in the midwest 
no one pats you on the back and says thank you she said 
they mark you off as a failed adoption 
mrs hudson said robert lives in a supervised foster home and 
calls occasionally but she doesnt want him in her house 
i still pray for him all the time she said he still calls 
me mom and i still think i am

democratic hopes of recapturing the 
governors mansion in south carolina rest with two insurgents 
painting their race as a rally of the masses against an entrenched 
aristocracy 
charging the statehouse doors are ernest passailaigue and theo 
mitchell state senate colleagues who meet in tuesdays primary the 
democratic victor faces popular republican gov carroll campbell in 
november 
passailaigue and mitchell are out to recapture for their party an 
office that democrats have held for all but eight years this 
century but they face a formidable challenge in trying to mobilize 
voters against campbell a firstterm governor who enjoys high 
public approval ratings 
the democrats have been trying to cast campbell as a career 
politician wooing the wealthy but forgetting the poor elderly and 
average working south carolinian 
ill be a citizens politician not a career politician 
passailaigue says referring to campbells six years in the general 
assembly and eight years in the us house before becoming governor 
mitchell who is hoping to become the states first black 
governor calls campbell the worst governor of south carolina in 
the 20th century he said campbell catered to the wealthy and 
privileged at the expense of the working people the poor people 
the retired and elderly 
its the oldest trick in the democratic bag of tricks to accuse 
the republicans of wooing the wealthy responded campbell 
spokesman tucker eskew 
the governor kicked off his reelection campaign last month 
stressing gains in the states economy environment and education 
system during his first term 
there is better education there are more jobs and there is a 
safer environment than we had three years ago he said 
his supporters cite the states rising per capita income 4 
percent unemployment rate and campbell initiatives against drugs and 
infant mortality 
campbells political strength is evident in his strong advantage 
in fundraising he has raised about 15 million in comparison with 
mitchells 65000 and passailaigues 69000 
the governor pulled in more than 500000 at a single fundraiser 
attended by president bush in may 
both passailaigue and mitchell have shied away from attacking 
each other a tactic passailaigue says is geared toward a democratic 
victory in november 
i think to beat campbell you have to run the perfect race he 
said you dont have any margin for error 
you really need a unified democratic party and then you need 
those coalitions that the democratic party one time had but no 
longer enjoys including groups such as environmentalists and the 
working class 
the platforms of both men are designed to rebuild those 
coalitions 
mitchell a 51yearold lawyer has consistently pushed for 
greater support of public transportation and assistance to the poor 
he has served in the general assembly for 16 years 
some state democrats privately fear a primary victory for 
mitchell could hasten the departure of whites from the party and 
undercut other democrats on the general election ballot but 
mitchell rejects such talk saying the vast majority of south 
carolinians are more concerned about a persons leadership ability 
experience and vision than his color 
passailaigue a 42yearold certified public accountant was 
first elected to the state senate in 1988 despite his freshman 
status he has been a frequent challenger of the senate leadership 
pushing for consideration of pet projects such as tax reform 
mitchell stresses his own public experience over that of 
passailaigue who responds that there are more important things to 
consider 
i think somebodys vision and what they want to do is more 
important than sitting in the general assembly or holding some other 
elected office passailaigue said 
both democrats say they want to reform the state tax system 
though they advocate different approaches on other issues the 
candidates share similar views 
both support a womans right to an abortion favor a state 
lottery to raise money for education and reject the states status 
as a dump for infectious hazardous and nuclear waste 
mitchell has kept a low public profile during much of the 
campaign but recently accused passailaigue of latching on to his 
own campaign themes 
my opponent has not only adopted my issues but five of my 
phrases as well he said mitchell accused passailaigue of picking 
up phrases of his such as clean nonpolluting industries and 
the regressive tax structure of south carolina 
passailaigue rejected the copycat charge

justice harry a blackmun says he is one of the 
supreme courts three old goats whose inevitable departure will 
solidify conservative domination of the court for the next 40 or 50 
years 
labeled a conservative when he joined the court two decades ago 
blackmun now is an outspoken critic of the courts rightward shift 
he demonstrated his candor during an interview with the associated 
press 
last year the cluster of five conservative members emerged 
and certainly this year they have control of the court completely 
and are making the most of it blackmun said 
he listed chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron 
r white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
as members of the courts conservative majority 
i had a feeling until last year that while they could have had 
control of the court they didnt really seize it the 81yearold 
justice said 
i suppose as long as i am not a member of that group it is 
difficult but we shouldnt resent it he said thats the way 
the system works that pendulum swings it will stay this way now 40 
or 50 years im sure 
blackmun who saturday marked his 20th anniversary as a justice 
predicts the court will grow more conservative after the departure 
of its three octogenarians himself and justices william j 
brennan 84 and thurgood marshall 81 
none of the three has indicated he is considering retirement 
brennan and marshall are the courts most liberal members often 
joined in the most divisive cases by blackmun and justice john paul 
stevens 70 
time will take its toll on the three old goats blackmun 
said we will be replaced by appointees of the current 
administration or the next one which is probably going to be 
another bush administration so it seems to me that before too long 
the court could be nine conservatives and that surely will last 
well into the next century 
when appointed by president nixon blackmun had the reputation of 
a politically and judicially conservative federal appeals court 
judge from minnesota 
early in his high court tenure he was ridiculed for his 
perceived dependence on thenchief justice warren e burger an old 
friend even after blackmun wrote the courts 1973 roe vs wade 
decision legalizing abortion he was considered a dependable 
conservative vote 
by 1980 however he had emerged as an independent force on the 
court in the past decade he increasingly sided with the liberal 
wing 
i dont believe ive changed in fundamental outlook blackmun 
said if one goes back and reads my opinions on the court of 
appeals youll find that they are not rockribbed conservatism of 
the type that seems to be popular today 
as a lower court judge blackmun said he and his colleagues 
always had the comfort of knowing that if were wrong those nine 
jokers down in washington will straighten us out here its the end 
of the line when one gets here he has to develop an indepth 
judicial philosophy 
he added one has to develop his attitude toward the 
constitutions great phrases what does equal protection mean 
what is cruel and unusual punishment i would hope that i have 
grown in that respect over the years but as far as shifting from 
conservatism to liberalism i dont believe i have done that 
on the bench blackmun most often displays a judicial scowl and 
can be snappish with lawyers off the bench warmth and humor 
emerge the justice turns downright effusive when discussing his 
three daughters and grandchildren or swapping baseball gossip 
he is less willing to discuss the possibility of retirement 
i think one has to have good health in this job i dont 
believe one can keep up without it and i am very conscious of the 
fact that some former colleagues of mine who were my age are long 
gone blackmun said 
after noting that he undergoes a complete physical exam at the 
mayo clinic each year blackmun smiled and said there are two or 
three out there who promise they will let me know when my level of 
senility reaches the unacceptable point 
blackmun has suffered from recurring cancer of the prostate 
gland most recently he was treated for it in 1987 no further 
problems have been reported 
blackmun realizes his role in court history will be defined 
largely by his writing the roe vs wade decision author of the 
abortion decision he once said we all pick up tags ill carry 
this one to my grave 
he has remained an ardent defender of a womans right to end her 
pregnancy and last year dissented bitterly from a decision that gave 
states more power to regulate abortion 
but blackmun said he hopes other aspects of his tenure will not 
be eclipsed i hope i would be remembered as a person of judicial 
integrity who wrote acceptably well and contributed in more than one 
field he told the ap 
id like to be known just as a good worker in the vineyard who 
held his own and contributed generally to the advancement of the 
law

latemay sales of north americanmade vehicles 
dipped just 33 percent from last years strong pace but analysts 
say real demand is weaker than the figures show 
the 10 major us car and truckmaking companies tuesday 
reported they sold vehicles at an average of 51002 a day during may 
2131 compared with a rate of 52767 during the same time last year 
a 59 percent drop in car sales more than offset a 16 percent 
rise in sales of trucks spurred mainly by general motors corp 
minivan and ford motor cos explorer sportutility vehicle sales 
although the sales pace picked up sharply from midmays 
disaster level i would not label overall demand as strong said 
analyst tom webb with the national automobile dealers association in 
mclean va 
the latemay sales drop came against a strong period last year 
when incentives were luring consumers into showrooms automakers 
lately have been trying to wean car buyers from rebates and 
lowinterest financing 
the latest figures would have been worse if not for another surge 
in sales of transplants cars made in the united states at 
japaneseowned factories 
latemay sales of cars made in north america by gm ford and 
chrysler corp fell 107 percent while transplant sales rose 23 
percent 
auto analyst david healy of barclays bank in new york said the 
strength of the transplant sales figures was a statistical quirk 
for instance us sales arms of toyota motor corp and honda 
motor co ltd reported they sold as many cars in the last 10day 
selling period of the month as they did in the first two periods 
combined 
we have another endofthemonth dramatic recovery in cars 
sales that doesnt mean a thing healy said i think youve got 
to look at car sales in the last 30 days and if you do that its 
going to smooth out that endofthemonth bulge 
for all of may domestic producers reported a 78 percent decline 
in car and truck sales with imported vehicles included sales ran 7 
percent behind the may 1989 level 
the big threes share of the us car market stood at about 61 
percent last month down from 66 percent a year before the 
transplants share of the market was about 12 percent in may 
compared with 73 percent a year ago imports made up the balance 
the industry softness reinforces a report issued monday by the 
conference board saying consumer confidence slipped slightly last 
month 
so far for the year sales of domestic and imported vehicles were 
43 percent behind last years pace with sales of domestic cars and 
trucks down 39 percent and import sales off 56 percent

a surge in stocks has taken the glitter off gold 
analysts say 
rumors of heavy selling by the soviet union and saudi arabia also 
have contributed to a slump that has pushed gold to its lowest level 
in a year the price could tumble to fouryear lows if it doesnt 
stabilize soon analysts say 
in recent days gold has traded in the high 350 range its 
lowest level since last june when the low for the month in london 
was 35870 
if it breaks 350 i think there will be more selling to 
335 said bernard savaiko senior metals analyst at painewebber 
inc 
the last time gold prices were that low was in june 1986 when 
the monthly low was 33675 according to the world gold council a 
nonprofit mining companies association 
gold was quoted at 35810 an ounce at londons afternoon fixing 
tuesday gold for current delivery settled at 35980 later on the 
new york commodity exchange up 120 from monday 
that marks a decline of about 15 percent since february when 
gold hit a nearterm high of 42375 the slide has been especially 
painful to investors because unlike stocks and bonds gold pays no 
dividends or interest 
some analysts said the slump stems from the rally in the stock 
market which has attracted investment money an ebbing of inflation 
fears because of recent signs of weak economic growth also has hurt 
gold which traditionally is bought as a hedge against higher 
prices they said 
rumors of large selling by the soviet union and middle eastern 
countries also have hurt the market twice since march sharp price 
drops have been attributed by market watchers to gold selling by 
saudi arabia 
the steep decline has scared many traders who are now afraid to 
bet on a rebound said mark kadlec a vice president at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
nobody knows how low low is there is a halfdecent 
possibility the low is around this level said fred bogart a gold 
trader and executive vice president at republic bank in new york 
if it drops below 350 all bets are off and anything could 
happen 
john lutely managing director of the gold institute in 
washington said reports that the soviets have had trouble meeting 
debt payments have made many traders fearful that the worlds 
secondlargest gold producer may begin selling more gold to raise 
hard currency the fear rather than any evidence of actual selling 
may be forcing the market down he said 
theyre smart traders and they know when its not in their best 
interest to sell and its not in their interest bogart said 
dismissing talk of big soviet gold solds 
some traders and analysts said its more likely that investors 
have left the gold market in favor of stocks judging by the rise in 
the dow jones industrial average toward the 3000 level in recent 
weeks the easing of inflation worries also has triggered a big 
rally in bond prices in recent weeks 
people have been going to paper rather than hold on to precious 
metals kadlec said

a bush administration plan to transfer 
authority over stock index futures from the commodity futures 
trading commission to the rival securities and exchange commission 
could tie up needed legislative reforms for both agencies say 
officials 
the treasury department unveiled the measure tuesday almost a 
month after indicating it would propose legislation to end the turf 
battle between the futures market overseer and the stock market 
regulator 
the cftc and the sec have been locked in an escalating war of 
words over which should oversee financial products that have 
elements of both a security and a futures contract such hybrid 
products include stock index futures which allow investors to 
speculate on movements in the stock market without having to buy the 
underlying stocks 
the administrations bill would unify regulation under the sec 
of the one market of stocks stock options and stock index 
futures according to a treasury fact sheet 
but in a speech delivered earlier tuesday mary l schapiro an 
sec commissioner worried that the bill had slim prospects for 
passage in the dwindling congressional session because this is a 
highly divisive emotionally charged issue on capitol hill 
and while we wallow in the jurisdictional quagmire other 
critically important legislation may be held up ms schapiro told 
the national economists club she favors an outright merger of the 
sec and cftc 
the chairman of the house agriculture committee rep kika de la 
garza dtexas said switching authority from one agency to another 
is not a solution 
the courts have interpreted the commodity exchange act as giving 
the cftc regulatory authority over any financial product with even 
the slightest aspect of a futures contract 
but sec and treasury officials have complained that this has led 
to long and costly legal battles while innovative financial products 
are being developed or copied in overseas markets hurting american 
competitiveness 
the administration bill would modify the exclusivity clause 
of the commodity exchange act to give the sec authority over stock 
index futures 
the move has been opposed vehemently by the cftc and its 
supporters on capitol hill mostly on the agriculture committees of 
the house and senate 
they have claimed that giving stock index futures to the sec will 
hobble the cftcs ability to regulate other futures contracts and 
reduce liquidity in the markets 
de la garza asked the treasury to submit legislative proposals 
to improve cftcs regulation of the markets for stock index 
futures 
noting that a cftc reform bill has been passed in the house but 
remains tied up in committee in the senate over the stock index 
futures issue de la garza called on the senate to act on the cftc 
reauthorization bill at the earlist possible time so we can go to 
conference and produce a final bill that gives the cftc the powers 
that it needs 
in proposing the bill treasury officials maintained tuesday that 
the only real change would be the name of the regulator because 
stock index futures would be regulated under the basic structure 
of the commodity exchange act not as securities 
the administration claimed the disruption to the futures markets 
would be minimal because stock index futures represent less than 
10 percent of the futures volume under cftc jurisdiction 
the bill also would give authority for setting margins the 
downpayment investors must make when buying securities on credit 
on stock index futures to the sec 
currently margins on futures contracts are set by the exchanges 
themselves usually at a fraction of the 50 percent required in 
securities transactions stock market margins are set by the federal 
reserve board the fed favors placing marginsetting authority under 
one agency although it hasnt said which agency it favors

investors bid up the price of rh macy amp co 
incs junk bonds after the retailer said it was looking at ways of 
restructuring its ponderous 567 billion debt 
macy disclosed the news tuesday in a letter to stockholders that 
accompanied its thirdquarter results 
investors and creditors have been concerned about macys 
financial health since the retailer suffered a 39 million loss in 
its second quarter which includes the crucial christmas shopping 
season 
the company which is still paying down debt from its 374 
billion leveraged buyout in 1986 told its stockholders we have 
been actively examining opportunities to reduce or refinance our 
debt 
we will continue to explore these alternatives in the hope of 
benefitting from current market conditions and opportunities the 
letter said 
the company also said it expected its results from the current 
quarter to be somewhat improved from the same period of last 
year 
word of the letter reached trading rooms in late afternoon and 
boosted the price of macys 14 percent bonds due in 2001 by 250 
to 67 per 100 face amounte the retailers 14 percent bonds due 
in 1998 rose 3 to 5650 
the companys bonds took a hit recently after several creditors 
known as factors said they were reconsidering their standards for 
financing shipments to macy 
some of the concerns were eased may 25 when the company said its 
cash flow the key to paying down its debt rose 4 percent during 
the third quarter on tuesday macy said it lost 631 million in 
its fiscal third quarter ended april 28 it lost 641 million in 
the same period a year earlier 
sales in the period edged up to 149 billion from 148 billion 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year macy reported a 
loss of 1353 million compared with a loss of 105 million a year 
earlier sales rose to 564 billion from 538 billion 
macy ran into trouble during the christmas season a time when 
it hoped to earn about half of its annual profits because it was 
forced to slash prices to compete with campeau corps department 
stores 
campeaus chains had cut their prices as they tried to bring in 
customers and avoid filing for bankruptcy court protection from 
their creditors the attempt was in vain the chains filed for 
chapter 11 reorganization in january 
it is no secret that we had a down christmas quarter last 
year macy said tuesday 
our game plan is working and it should yield significant 
improvement in cash flow and a return to historical levels of 
profitability for our november through january quarter the 
retailer said

to five friends and business associates the securities and exchange 
commission has charged

when tony quiroga received his 
termination notice from clairol inc last year he quickly found a 
new employer himself 
quiroga a former factory manager at the leading beauty products 
firm in stamford conn decided to ditch the corporate mainstream 
and start his own small business 
now he sets his own hours and signs all the checks for a 
franchise branch of mailboxes etc an office products and postal 
services chain in the nearby town of fairfield 
quirogas new life hasnt freed him from worrying about the 
amount of cash in the bank accustomed to company health plans after 
19 years he panicked when his 17yearold son got hurt a month ago 
and had to be rushed to the hospital he wasnt sure if his wifes 
insurance policy would cover the bill 
nonetheless quiroga said he likes running a small business so 
apparently do other former executives who have started their own 
companies after losing jobs in corporate overhauls 
thousands of lowerand midlevel executives have been laid off in 
the dizzying era of mergers takeovers and restructurings that have 
reshaped the face of corporate america in recent years 
the national planning association a washingtonbased business 
research organization estimates that based on government 
statistics plant closings and other corporate staff reductions have 
displaced an estimated 2 million workers a year since the late 1970s 
most executive victims of this workforce readjustment have sought 
jobs with other businesses where they find comfort and security in 
a steady salary and benefits said joan learn president of the 
greenwich group an executive counseling firm that encourages 
executives to consider selfemployment 
but evidence suggests a growing number of these people are 
viewing pink slips as golden opportunities to become their own 
bosses selling everything from flowers to computer software 
experts say part of the reason is the insecurity that layoff victims 
feel by going to work for someone else again 
challenger gray amp christmas a chicagobased consulting and 
executive placement company estimates the number of laidoff 
executives who have become entrepreneurs has tripled in the past 
five years from 7 percent of the total in 1985 to about 20 percent 
today the company bases the estimate on its own quarterly surveys 
of 600 displaced managers around the country 
there is no question that a prime factor in the decision to 
become an entrepreneur is concern over another discharge said 
james challenger company president these people are hoping to 
guarantee that they will never again hear an employer tell them they 
no longer have a job 
kathleen purdy walked down both career paths when she was laid 
off as director of internal management consulting for infilco corp 
of meriden conn she started looking for new jobs with help from 
learn but also drafted a plan to form her own consulting firm 
she chickened out when time came to launch the plan instead 
accepting a job as a marketing director for onsite energy a 
subsidiary of pacificorp in portland ore 
but when she got laid off from that job two years later she took 
the plunge 
i decided to go for it and im just delighted said purdy 
whose consulting firm opened in january its working out very 
well 
going it alone isnt always easy for the corporate type however 
especially middle managers who have staked their professional 
careers on loyalty to a wellestablished business with thousands of 
employees 
you miss the camaraderie of your associates you miss the 
secondfamily society that a large company has to offer you make a 
lot of good friends when youre working at large corporations 
said dan mccarthy a former senior executive at pitney bowes inc a 
leading officeequipment maker in stamford 
mccarthy left the company on his own last september when it 
announced a restructuring that watered down his job hes just 
getting started running a franchise branch of remedy temporary 
services an employment agency 
many displaced executives find they must readjust their focus 
away from expense accounts and profitandloss statements and 
toward concern for their customers whom they are often meeting face 
to face for the first time 
having been senior management for the last 18 19 years there 
is a management syndrome you have to be careful of you cant just 
sit at your desk and feel youre going to be firing off a lot of 
orders to people said mccarthy who spent 29 years at ncr corp 
in dayton ohio before he went to pitney bowes and then ventured 
out on his own 
there is a big difference in coming out of a corporate 
structure where things are much more formalized and there are many 
long meetings and a certain amount of politics that exist in every 
company he said thats fine for that way of life but it 
doesnt work for the entrepreneur you have to keep the customer in 
mind every time 
many former executives who turn to selfemployment say they find 
a new source of energy and excitement in their layoff afterlife that 
compensates for the anxieties 
im getting more of a kick out of doing this than id ever 
anticipated mccarthy said it allows me to bring forth all the 
experiences i had in the past and use that effort and energy on my 
own behalf 
learn who runs the greenwich group with her husband said the 
firm has grown steadily since its founding four years ago largely 
because of corporate restructurings and growing interest in 
selfemployment they estimate they will help 300 to 400 people from 
50 to 60 companies this year 
so far only one of the firms wouldbe entrepreneur clients has 
given up an executive who underestimated his need to be around 
people he sold the business and went back to work for someone else 
the rest appear to be thriving learn said 
even though its risky it just feels right purdy said 
you start creating things and you realize you have the power to 
create the income to create the business in a way its more 
security because you control it its not a company that may have to 
downsize there isnt security in corporations anymore

britain introduced a smaller five pound note 
wednesday that includes a new engraving of a gracefully aging queen 
the change the first in two decades is designed to combat 
hightech forgeries and cut production costs the new note is 
scheduled to be released into circulation on thursday 
no item created by man cant be recreated said nigel 
bevittsmith manager of design and development at the bank of 
englands printing works what we try to do is to make it 
timeconsuming and as expensive as possible 
the fivepound notes have been reduced in size from 57by3 
inches to 53by27 inches 
among the other changes the dominant blue in the notes was 
lightened from navy to turquoise and a blend of background colors 
was created to challenge sophisticated forgers who use modern color 
reproduction machines 
also the position and color of the numbers was changed and a 
silvercolored windowed thread running through the note was added 
the bank of england which already has printed 200 million of the 
new notes said queen elizabeths new portrait shows the monarch 
gracefully aged rather than as a delicate brunette young enough 
to be prince charles sister 
railway pioneer george stephenson replaces the duke of wellington 
on the new notes 
all english notes will be redesigned over the next four years and 
will be between 16 percent and 22 percent smaller the bank of 
england said

for years hes played a reallife game of 
monopoly with such swagger that it seemed the stakes were play 
money now a cash crunch may force the tycoon to trade away his 
yacht his hotels or his casinos 
donald trump whose name adorns everything from airplanes to 
board games usually in large letters may also have to wave 
arrivederci to the glitzy fastlane lifestyle he enjoyed during his 
rise in the 1980s 
creditors reportedly are pressing the multimillionaire for cash 
and negotiations that are under way could compel trump to sell huge 
chunks of his empire 
the real estate and casino magnate has a reported 2 billion in 
bank debt his holdings once estimated at 15 billion had been 
sliced to 500 million forbes magazine reported last month 
the taj mahal his centerpiece atlantic city casino is said to 
be for sale the trump princess his yacht is on the block the 
trump shuttle his airline is up for grabs 
on monday bondholders filed a lawsuit accusing trump of 
promoting the taj mahal at the expense of the trump plaza and trump 
castle in atlantic city 
add to the equation his estranged wife ivana who awaits her 
share with a 25 million prenuptial agreement thats looking better 
all the time 
hell have to trim the fat get rid of the boat the mansions 
the helicopter one banker involved in the trump talks told the 
wall street journal 
while this answers the question what do you give the man who 
has everything cold hard cash it raises another what will 
donald be left with trump the living room carpet the trump motel 
and drivein theater 
trump through spokesman dan klores declined to comment further 
on the situation tuesday but the donald never foresaw such problems 
in his first selfcongratulatory book trump the art of the 
deal 
i dont do it for the money ive got enough much more than 
ill ever need trump wrote in the 1988 bestseller as recently 
as april the developer claimed he was selling off assets only to 
become the king of cash 
marvin roffman was not swayed by such talk the philadelphia 
gaming analyst predicted problems for the taj mahal and he claims 
trump had him fired for saying so 
roffman apparently vindicated by the reports of layoffs and 
losses at the palatial resort bit his tongue tuesday and cited a 
pending legal action my attorneys have cautioned me and i really 
cant talk he said 
the new york tabloids had no such concerns and the rumors of 
impending financial crisis produced a round of entertaining 
trumpbashing 
uhowe headlined the front page of the post beneath a photo 
of trump inside the paper posed the question the taj eighth 
blunder of the world trump in a slump announced the daily 
news 
to me trump sounds about two steps away from selling used 
magazines on the sidewalk wrote daily news columnist gail 
collins at least one expert felt she might not be too far off 
trump just thought the real estate market was heading upwards 
indefinitely and people would keep buying at higher and higher 
prices he forgot that whatever goes up must come down said abe 
wallach an executive at the development firm first capital partners 
at the very least his financial problems could postpone

administration and congressional bargainers 
resumed their slowmoving budget talks today with a visit from 
defense secretary dick cheney whose agency is a prime target for 
spending cuts 
many congressional democrats have been arguing for months that 
with the breakup of the warsaw pact the pentagons budget should be 
cut republicans are more reluctant to make such reductions 
im going to give them an oldfashioned gospel revivalhour on 
defense the ranking republican on the senate armed services 
committee john warner of virginia said before entering the 
closeddoor meeting 
the session the fifth since bargaining began last month comes 
as democrats and republicans begin maneuvering for political 
advantage over the annual spending bills for next year 
congress majority democrats said they would start working on the 
appropriations measures in the house and senate this week 
sen phil gramm rtexas argued however that those bills should 
not be enacted until negotiators work out a deficitcutting deal for 
next year he contended that if democrats begin working on the 
spending bills before a budget deal is reached the measures will be 
too expensive because they will not reflect any cuts set by the 
budget bargainers 
if they do that it would represent a virtually insurmountable 
obstacle to negotiating a goodfaith compromise on the budget 
said gramm one of the budget negotiators 
but democrats noted that the start of fiscal 1991 is oct 1 less 
than four months away we are reaching a critical stage here 
said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee 
democrats planned to begin subcommittee wok on spending bills in 
the house as early as thursday democrats said the full senate could 
begin considering a 1991 budget within two weeks the budget is a 
nonbinding fiscal blueprint that lays the groundwork for spending 
measures 
the budget talks between the white house and congress were 
resuming after a break of nearly two weeks for lawmakers memorial 
day recess 
so far negotiators have reached an informal consensus to try 
reduce next years federal deficit by 45 billion to 60 billion 
they also want to find a total of 425 billion to 600 billion in 
savings over the next five years 
but there is still a long way to go democrats tend to prefer 
deficit cuts in the high level of those ranges while republicans 
favor lesser reductions 
and the bargainers have not yet traded proposals for shrinking 
the deficit by cutting spending and raising taxes such negotiating 
is not expected to begin for at least a week 
because of easing eastwest tensions the pentagon is expected to 
bear a heavy portion of whatever spending cuts are worked out 
cheney was stating the defense departments case at todays meeting 
when president bush submitted his budget in january he proposed 
spending 3033 billion for defense in fiscal 1991 the house 
approved a spending plan with 2954 billion for the military while 
the senate budget committee has earmarked 2939 billion for defense 
in its blueprint 
the goal of the talks is to find a way to limit next years red 
ink to no more than 64 billion as required by the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law the white house says that unless something is 
done the 1991 budget gap could be 206 billion that would be more 
than double the 1005 billion shortfall bush predicted in january

hitachi ltd of japan said wednesday it has 
developed the worlds fastest mainframe computer the first time the 
company has beaten industry leader ibm and other manufacturers to a 
newgeneration release 
the hitachi m880 processor family to be released friday will 
allow us to catch up with ibm and has increased our 
competitiveness hitachi vice president takeo miura told reporters 
he said the new generation computers will use about 20 percent 
less power and take up about half the space of the latest processor 
family developed by international business machines corp 
hitachi however was not expected to ship the new models in 
japan until the fall and in the united states until the second 
quarter of 1991 about the same time ibm was expected to have its 
latest mainframe ready said don young an analyst for sanford c 
bernstein in new york 
with ibms next generation still an unknown quantity i think 
what weve got here is apples and oranges apples is hitachi today 
and oranges is ibm tomorrow young said 
he added however that the announcement really makes hitachi 
an incredible player in this market and puts them into the range of 
competing with ibm 
hitachi said monthly lease charges on its new mainframes would 
range from 512450 to 102 million about 10 percent to 15 percent 
better than the pricing currently offered by ibm 
i would surprised if we dont see a 10 to 15 percent price 
improvement from ibm next year young said 
such generalpurpose computers are mainly used for information 
management systems in large corporations 
ibm currently controls more than 70 percent of the us mainframe 
market amdahl corp is no 2 with 10 percent to 15 percent and 
hitachi is a distant third with about of half of amdahls share 
young said in japan hitachi also lags behind ibm and fujitsu ltd 
the four new hitachi models were developed in response to 
customer demand for faster more powerful computers miura said all 
are ibmcompatible he said 
the topoftheline m880420 is capable of performing at 155 
million instructions a second compared to 88 for hitachis current 
highend model and 122 for ibms topline model the 3090 600j the 
company said 
this is the first time hitachi has beaten ibm and other 
competitors such as fujitsu and amdahl to a newgeneration release 
in the mainframe market

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade 
the market was heavily influenced by reports that a cloud with 
unidentified contents was heading towards finland from the soviet 
union said john frazier an analyst with gerald inc in chicago 
the cloud was first spotted over the soviet union on may 26 
according to viennabased international atomic energy authority an 
agency spokesman said wednesday the ussr had not informed them of 
any radioactivity in the cloud 
the reports triggered speculation about possible damage to 
farmland in those areas that could mean stronger demand for us 
grains and soybeans 
also influencing the market was a weather outlook by a private 
forecaster that calls for unusually hot dry weather in the midwest 
in late july and early august the heat is forecast for a period 
when corn and soybeans mature 
in addition to news of the unidentified cloud soybean futures 
received a boost from strong cash markets for soybeans light 
selling by farmers and the continuing brazilian port shutdown 
wheat futures received some support from commercial and 
speculative buying although forecasts of warm weather that would 
speed the harvesting of the winter wheat crop weighed on prices 
at the close wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 331 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with july at 281 a bushel oats were a 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with july at 146 a bushel soybeans 
were cent to 3 cents higher with july at 594 a bushel

all but one of the sakowitz specialty stores were 
slated for liquidation after no bids were received for the 
texasbased retailer at a bankruptcy court hearing wednesday 
the onceproud chain which includes four stores in houston one 
in dallas and another in cincinnati is 80 percent owned by lj 
hooker corp hooker has been disposing of its assets under 
bankruptcy court supervision 
us bankruptcy court judge tina brozman indicated she would 
approve the plan to liquidate all of the texas sakowitz stores and a 
formal order was expected to be issued soon goingoutofbusiness 
sales would start soon thereafter and run through the end of july 
the sakowitz in cincinnatis forest fair mall would remain open 
business at the shopping mall another hooker holding could suffer 
if the store closed similar arrangements were made when hooker 
divested its bonwit teller and b altman amp co department store 
chains hooker has kept the altmans and bonwit teller stores open 
for business at the forest fair mall hooker also has continued 
operating a bonwit teller in a columbia sc mall that it owns 
the sakowitz chain headquartered in houston has about 450 
employees it has focused on womens apparel and accessories during 
much of its 88 years in business the chain enjoyed a good 
reputation for quality and fashion sense 
but in the mid1980s a struggling regional economy due largely to 
the oil price slump proved too much for sakowitz it entered 
bankruptcy court proceedings in 1985 
sakowitz reorganized in chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
and emerged from court protection under the stewardship of a new 
company that teamed up with hooker at that time hooker acquired 
its 80 percent stake 
an attorney for hooker sheldon i hirshon said at the hearing 
that sakowitz never succeeded in really turning itself around in 
the year ended jan 31 1990 sakowitz suffered a net operating loss 
of 44 million and lost 13 million in the past three months 
hirshon said 
at the hearing hooker invited bids for either its interest in 
sakowitz or the assets of the chain no bidders came forward 
an attorney for robert t sakowitz formerly president and chief 
executive officer of the chain told the court that sakowitz had 
wanted to make an offer but needed more time to arrange financing 
sakowitz didnt make a formal bid and judge brozman moved the case 
forward 
sakowitz who attended the hearing and spoke with reporters 
expressed regret at the chains fate and disputed the implication 
that it was beyond redemption 
he distributed a personal statement in which he said the 
complications of hookers bankruptcy proceedings discouraged many 
domestic and foreign investors from joining him in bidding for 
sakowitz 
with the liquidation of sakowitz hooker will have disposed of 
the bulk of its retail holdings that were acquired since 1986 the 
atlantabased company which still has various commercial and 
residential property holdings is a subsidiary of australias hooker 
corp 
sydneybased hooker is being managed by a courtappointed 
provisional liquidator in a process similar to what its american 
subsidiary is experiencing in the us bankruptcy court

shearson lehman hutton inc overhauled its 
operations wednesday reviving a respected investment banking name 
and dumping a vestige of its expansionist 1980s in a bid to rebound 
from record losses on wall street 
the restructuring marks another step by parent american express 
co to reverse the fortunes of the nations second largest 
brokerage which lost 915 million in the first three months of the 
year 
shearson said it was grouping into two divisions from four 
shearson lehman brothers for individual investing and asset 
management and lehman brothers for investment banking and capital 
markets activities the full firm will be known as shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
in the investment banking division shearson hopes resurrecting 
the 140yearold lehman brothers name will mean more respect and 
cache during one of the slowest periods in wall street history 
we hope the lehman brothers name will have the magic still 
shearson chairman and chief executive howard l clark jr said in an 
interview a little magic wouldnt hurt 
shearson acquired the lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc investment 
bank in 1984 as part of a rapid growth strategy during the 
dealheavy 80s dubbing the new firm shearson lehman brothers inc 
same as the new one 
lehman brothers dates to 1850 when it was founded by immigrants 
from bavaria as a commodities house in montgomery ala the 
investment bank was among those dominating wall street in the early 
1900s and grew rapidly after world war ii 
about 1000 lehman brothers veterans still work at shearson the 
no2 brokerage behind merrill lynch amp co 
under thenchairman peter cohen who was ousted earlier this year 
by american express chairman james d robinson iii shearson 
acquired ef hutton amp co shortly after the 1987 stock market crash 
by dropping hutton from its name shearson erases the public 
connection with a merger that fostered a clash of corporate cultures 
and has been called the firms biggest expansion mistake 
clark said the new structure organizes the firm along customer 
lines with shearson lehman brothers for individual investments and 
lehman brothers for institutions he said the new shape would 
focus accountability and responsibility of the business to 
respond to client needs and interests 
clark is part of the american express invasion running the 
shearson overhaul when he was picked to head the firm he was chief 
financial officer of american express and his father is a former 
chairman of the company 
the credit card and travel service giant in recent months has put 
more than 1 billion in capital into shearson and is buying all of 
the brokerages remaining common stock american express now holds 
61 percent of shearson 
shearson lost an industry record 915 million in the first 
quarter in part because of expenses to pay for a restructuring 
including about 2000 layoffs most wall street firms have been 
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the stock 
market crash shearson also has been criticized for bad management 
overexpansion and excessive spending during the last decade 
shearson said its boston co money management subsidiary would 
remain a separate business 
richard s fuld jr a lehman veteran and current president of 
shearsons capital markets group and sherman r lewis jr 
president of investment and merchant banking were named cochief 
executives of the new lehman brothers division 
that division will serve corporations governments and 
institutions including capital markets sales research and trading 
as well as investment and merchant banking 
as expected jonathan s linen an american express executive 
was named president and chief executive of the shearson lehman 
brothers division linen currently is president and chief executive 
of american express direct marketing and travelers checks group

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter warned 
wednesday that an agricultural trade war could result if a deadlock 
over the united states demands at international trade talks 
continues through the end of the year 
the united states is seeking the removal of european farm export 
subsidies over 10 years 
if no agreement is reached i guarantee you the costs for some 
of our trading partners would increase dramatically said yeutter 
the luncheon speaker at a forum sponsored by the journal of commerce 
and the national foreign trade council 
the united states has to protect its own interests yeutter 
said ive thought about how we can do that and hope i can keep 
those thoughts in the back of my mind and never have to surface 
them 
yeutter while conceding that us farm policies also distort 
trade said us export subsidies amount to less than 1 billion a 
year while european help for farm exports comes to 10 billion 
annually 
we all have to go down the reform road together yeutter said 
yeutter said proposals for cutting european subsidies in half are 
insufficient 
the common markets export subsidies are intended to help 
relatively expensive european farm products compete against 
lowerpriced goods in the world market 
us negotiators unsuccessfully pushed their call to stop export 
subsidies as well as an end to import barriers and domestic 
subsidies at a meeting of the organization for economic cooperation 
and development last week in paris 
i am never surprised about intransigence on the part of the 
european community yeutter said of the deadlock 
us trade representative carla hills and other officials have 
said the agricultural issue is the linchpin for all other topics 
in the current round of negotiations under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt a forum for promoting freer trade 
the talks known as the uruguay round began in that country in 
1986 and are to end this december in brussels the negotiations 
involve about 100 countries and are designed to reduce barriers to 
trade 
us officials estimate that ending the farm subsidies could 
boost us agricultural exports by 11 billion annually 
common market officials say the subsidies can be reduced but not 
eliminated because so many small farmers depend on them 
earlier at the forum andreas van agt european community 
ambassador to the united states said europe would not agree 
unrealistic solutions that are politically unachievable such as 
abandoning subsidies 
among the areas of discussion held up by the deadlock are 
textiles and services 
third world countries want fewer barriers to textile trade the 
united states under pressure from the domestic textile industry 
has been seeking less comprehensive reduction of existing tariffs 
and quotas gatt doesnt cover textile trade which is handled by 
the multifiber agreement between about 80 countries 
the united states however is seeking to have gatt cover 
financial services poorer countries are opposed to gatt regulation 
of banking investment and insurance so they can protect their 
infant financial industries 
the next formal meeting of negotiators is scheduled for july 23 
in geneva switzerland

when lee iacocca hired gerald greenwald to help 
him rescue chrysler corp from collapse it began with a discreet 
phone call to greenwalds home in caracas venezuela where he 
worked for ford motor co 
more than a decade later a similar secret offer confronted 
greenwald again only this time a ual corp union coalition was 
making the surreptitious contact luring the chrysler vice chairman 
with the job of leading its effort to buy the airline company for 
454 billion 
why greenwald vacated chrysler especially at a time when its 
financial health again appears to be sliding dangerously may be 
debated for a long time 
greenwald and people who know him say he was lured away by the 
enormous challenge of carrying off the ual buyout a debtfinanced 
deal that would result in the largest employeeowned company in the 
country if successful 
here i am having a second chance to go through a major 
industrial event in american history greenwald said when he made 
the surprise announcement may 31 that he was quitting 
some auto industry people familiar with greenwald who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said theyre skeptical about his chances of 
assembling the financing needed to purchase ual which has seen 
several earlier buyout proposals fall through the current climate 
of tight credit wont make it any easier for him to meet an aug 9 
deadline for raising the money 
but others said that if anyone can coordinate the ual effort it 
is greenwald his calm and reassuring manner was critical in winning 
the confidence of skeptical lenders to chrysler in the early 1980s 
and helped convince the federal government to provide 15 billion 
in loan guarantees 
i could not think of anybody better suited to put together the 
awesome financial arrangements that the buyers of ual are trying to 
do he has tremendous talent with bankers said jerry h pyle a 
former chrysler executive who now is president of gulf states toyota 
in houston 
mr iacocca handled the feds and jerry handled the bankers and 
im not sure he didnt have a tougher job than lee did pyle said 
in greenwalds 11year tenure with chrysler he established 
himself as a careful deliberate diplomatic and softspoken 
complement to iacocca the scrappy chairman of the no 3 automaker 
greenwald is considered largely responsible for imposing the 
financial discipline that resurrected chryslers profitability and 
made himself and iacocca wealthy in the process 
the two men could hardly be more different iacocca 65 is a 
profane flamboyant engineer and the son of italian catholic 
immigrants greenwald 54 is son of russian jewish poultry 
wholesalers he grew up in st louis attended princeton on an eagle 
scout scholarship rose in the auto industry as a financier and is 
known to think carefully before making any important move 
iacocca was bombastic one former chrysler executive said 
jerry would examine offthewall ideas all the way to the obvious 
a lot of times he would take the more obtuse direction he was very 
much solicitous of the opinions of other people but he would come 
to the point of having examined this whole thing and say ok this 
is the way we should go 
despite their contrasting styles both men developed a warm 
friendship and greenwald widely was considered iacoccas likely 
successor but greenwald always treated the talk about taking 
iacoccas place with selfeffacing modesty i dont think anyone 
is going to step into lees 21inch shoes and walk the way he 
does greenwald once said 
greenwalds early experience in the auto business may have helped 
him prepare for his tenure at troubled chrysler which lost 11 
billion in 1979 and 17 billion in 1980 
his first job came with ford in 1957 as a personnel 
administrator for a new division called edsel it collapsed in three 
months greenwald later recollected i wondered how i could have 
done so badly so soon 
but his career fared better than the edsel he moved into 
financial analysis and by the late 1960s was concentrating on fords 
latin american operations 
the company promoted him to management positions in brazil 
paris london and caracas over most of the following 10 years it 
was a life of 12hour workdays and regular householdmoving 
upheavals for wife glenda and their four children 
greenwald liked life abroad but the prospect of rising further 
in fords hierarchy remained unclear so the phone call from iaccoca 
in the spring of 1979 offering greenwald a quantum leap in stature 
wasnt unwelcome 
despite the close iacoccagreenwald relationship that developed 
over the next decade speculation persisted about the succession 
question at chrysler the question was compounded by iacoccas vague 
plans about retirement and the automakers financial backslide in 
recent years 
clearly there was some kind of a battle shaping up over 
there a former executive said there is a certain amount of 
satisfaction and adrenalin that goes into the kind of situation that 
he and we all had at chrysler putting it all back together and 
making it succeed 
once youve done that then it didnt work out too well its 
downonyourknees time again 
some people familiar with greenwald speculated privately that he 
was excited at the prospect of going into a new industry and defying 
the skepticism that a large employeeowned airline will succeed 
i think he figures hes got a better chance of doing that than 
taking over an unhealthy chrysler corporation and making it work 
one former chrysler official said 
greenwald isnt considered extravagant or publicity hungry and 
is known for quiet demonstrations of generosity for example he set 
up a college scholarship program for 50 fifthgraders in the public 
schools of university city mo where he grew up it could cost him 
775000 if all go on to get undergraduate degrees 
greenwalds wife who established an independent writing career 
while the family was abroad founded and runs the magazine michigan 
woman it appears there will be no immediate changes in her 
professional life while her husband jets from home in the detroit 
suburb of bloomfield hills to uals base in chicago and to new york 
where lies much of the money he seeks 
we jokingly say if youve got to commute greenwald said 
have one of the spouses run an airline

officials of the central banks of japan 
france england and the united states expressed confidence wednesday 
in the ability of west germanys central bank to control inflation 
after east and west germany merge their currencies next month 
there has been concern that the plan could lead to inflation in 
west germany because east germans will be able to exchange some of 
their nononvertible ostmarks for the west german mark leading to a 
vast increase in the spending power of east germans 
inflation in west germany the dominant economy in europe could 
force the nations central bank the bundesbank to raise interest 
rates that could unsettle world financial markets and lead to 
higher rates in other countries 
but central bankers gathered at the annual international monetary 
conference told reporters they are unconcerned about that prospect 
because of the careful plans for monetary unification laid out by 
the west german government 
robin leighpemberton governor of the bank of england said he 
believes there will be a 10 percent increase in west germanys money 
supply as a result of much of east germanys currency being 
converted into marks that increase is roughly equal to the expected 
rise in the gross domestic product of the nations due to the 
unification he saidso it looks as though the immediate monetary 
situation is one of match and therefore the immediate effect on 
interest rates may be neutral he said 
he said the bundesbank has been confronted with a novel 
difficult political situation and in my opinion theyve handled it 
extremely well 
jacques de larosiere governor of the bank of france said the 
way this process is being handled the rapidity of the elaboration 
of the monetary unification treaty the way things have been 
carved out in terms of the monetary devices all goes well for the 
stability of system and for interest rates 
takeshi ohta deputy governor of the bank of japan said he also 
was confident about the ability of west germanys monetary 
authorities to ensure a smooth transition to a unified currency 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan said world interest 
rates already have a presumed forecast for the impact of the 
monetary unification but that many unknown factors remain 
there are a number of market forces that are involved in this 
process which will override whatever particular agreements are 
made he said 
it is quite conceivable that to the extent that events 
deviate from the markets expectations that rates either in germany 
or elsewhere could either go up or down he added 
bundesbank president karl otto pohl originally was scheduled to 
attend the session but canceled several weeks ago apparently due to 
constraints on his time in the face of the unification plan 
conference organizers said the conference brought together 
government and commercial bankers from 22 nations 
on another topic greenspan was asked why the federal reserve has 
not acted recently to ease us interest rates in light of signs of 
domestic economic weakness 
the signs in the economy at this stage are really quite 
ambiguous in that respect he said 
he said it is true that the rate of economic growth is 
exceptionally slow but that the unemployment rate has hardly 
changed in recent months 
what we are seeing is a really quite unusual phenomenon 
namely very slow labor force growth and a corresponding rather slow 
economy associated with it but we do not as yet see any underlying 
economic deterioration he said

foreign exchange dealers reported trading volume was light 
a series of concerns depressed the swiss franc and west german 
mark steering investors to the dollar

international monetary fund and speculation about possible declines 
in swiss interest rates encouraged selling of the franc said 
richard levine a first vice president at merrill lynch futures 
the west german mark came under renewed pressure amid reports of 
a potential strike by thousands of workers in east germany 
unconfirmed rumors of a possible accident at a soviet nuclear power 
plant stemming from reports that finnish authorities were checking

significant impact on currency trading overall

the midwest california and the southwest will see 
the biggest increases in real estate investment in the next two 
years leading real estate executives and economists predicted in a 
study released here wednesday 
the specialists however see a sluggish real estate market 
overall through 1995 citing recent overbuilding as the major 
detriment they expect the market to grow more slowly than the 
consumer price index in the first half of the decade 
the experts also expect a decline in available capital including 
foreign investment some respondents see a catastrophic impact on 
real estate from the savings and loan crisis but others believe the 
worst already has come 
the nationwide survey mailed in january compiles responses of 
400 real estate specialists to forecast the real estate market for 
the next five years 
the study was conducted by ernst amp young real estate advisory 
services and the national real estate index a computer service that 
tracks real estate values and rents 
houston was cited as offering the best overall potential for real 
estate investment over the next five years dallasfort worth was 
the second choice followed by los angeles seattle and washington 
despite the overall prediction of a slow market 284 percent of 
the respondents said their firms would increase investment in the 
midwest in the next two years compared with spending in 1989 
the specialists appear less enthusiastic about individual markets 
in the midwest however only chicago was selected among the top 10 
investment markets nationwide and only two others made the top 30 
columbus ohio at 29 and minneapolisst paul at 30 
i think part of thats a lack of knowledge about many 
midwestern cities said michael l evans national director for real 
estate advisory services in san francisco a branch of the 
accounting firm ernst amp young 
i think a lot of people view the midwest as being chicago he 
said i think they were looking at the principal cities in each 
region and perhaps didnt have the information about other cities 
almost 26 percent of the respondents expect to spend more in 
california and 24 percent will invest more heavily in the 
southwest the survey showed 
but 214 percent of the specialists think they will spend less on 
real estate in the northeast compared with 173 percent who expect 
to spend more in the region 
the decrease can be traced to the belief of 286 percent of the 
analysts that new york city is the most overpriced market in the 
country for real estate investment 
los angeles finished second in the balloting for most overpriced 
market but also was identified as the metropolitan market likely to 
produce the best real estate performance in the next five years 
i think it reflects the fact that los angeles placed high in 
every category said evans its just a feeling that the 
southern california economy doesnt want to stop 
other top overall performers are expected to be atlanta seattle 
washington and chicago 
other markets viewed as overpriced were boston chosen by 99 
percent of the respondents san francisco 75 percent and 
washington dc 56 percent 
the survey also examined projected growth in specific property 
sectors apartments warehouses retail space and central and 
suburban office space 
prospects for building apartments are best in los angeles the 
specialists said atlanta is next followed by seattle san diego 
and washington 
atlanta topped the list of candidates for warehouse space 
followed by chicago los angeles dallasfort worth and seattle 
seven of the top 20 projected retail markets are in california 
the specialists chose orange county and los angeles as the best two 
retail markets followed by atlanta san francisco and seattle 
washington was rated as the best market for central and suburban 
office space in the first half of the 1990s rounding out the top 
five markets for office space in the central business district were 
san francisco los angeles chicago and seattle 
los angeles was second in the voting for prospects for suburban 
office space followed by orange county calif atlanta and new 
york

energy futures prices finished higher wednesday on the new york 
mercantile exchange rebounding from early losses 
on other markets grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
precious metals declined and livestock and pork futures were mixed 
energy futures rallied after opening sharply lower in reaction to 
inventory figures released after the close of trading tuesday by the 
american petroleum institute 
the api report showed an increase of 25 million barrels in crude 
oil stocks a 23 million barrel increase in gasoline stocks and a 
41 million barrel increase in distillates which include heating 
oil 
but prices soon reversed course and began to rise the feeling is 
that all the bad news is out and from the fundamental perspective 
little more could adversely affect the market said nauman baraket 
an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
andrew lebow an analyst with edampf man international futures 
inc in new york said the market was also helped by tuesdays 
announcement by the saudis that they will stick to their oil 
production quota set by opec in may 
kuwait also said it would stick to the production quota set by 
the 13 members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
rumors of a possible nuclear power accident in the soviet union 
which would increase demand for crude oil and reduce soviet exports 
also fueled the market lebow said 
a mysterious cloud was first spotted over the soviet union on may 
26 and was moving towards finland according to viennabased 
international atomic energy authority an agency spokesman said 
wednesday the ussr had not informed them of any radioactivity in the 
cloud 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 24 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in july at 1692 a barrel heating 
oil was 12 cent to 29 cent higher with july at 4731 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 40 cent to 56 cent higher with july 
at 5836 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices were mostly higher on the 
chicago board of trade 
the market was heavily influenced by the reports of the cloud 
heading towards finland said john frazier an analyst with gerald 
inc in chicago 
the reports triggered speculation about possible damage to 
farmland in those areas that could mean stronger demand for us 
grains and soybeans 
also influencing the market was a weather outlook by a private 
forecaster that calls for unusually hot dry weather in the midwest 
in late july and early august the heat is forecast for a period 
when corn and soybeans mature 
soybean futures received a boost from strong cash markets for 
soybeans light selling by farmers and the continuing brazilian port 
shutdown 
wheat futures received some support from commercial and 
speculative buying although forecasts of warm weather that would 
speed the harvesting of the winter wheat crop weighed on prices 
wheat was 2 cents lower to a cent higher july at 331 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with july at 
279 a bushel oats were unchanged to a cent lower with july at 
146 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 4 cents higher with july 
at 594 a bushel 
precious metals futures declined on new yorks commodity exchange 
craig sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in 
new york said the market tried to keep the positive tone seen in 
tuesdays trading but was unable to do so 
the market is continuing a trend downward he said people 
are not interested in the market and there is nothing in the way of 
news that is significant to the market 
gold was 240 to 280 lower with june at 35240 a troy ounce 
silver was 33 cents to 35 cents lower with june at 5030 a troy 
ounce 
livestock futures were higher and pork lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 07 cent to 37 cent higher with june at 7522 a 
pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 48 cent higher with august at 
8545 cents a pound hogs were 98 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with june at 6605 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 125 cent 
lower to 37 cent higher with july at 6605 cents a pound

its not exactly michael jacksons thriller 
but corporate raider t boone pickens is turning to similar pop 
technology to step up his battle for changes in a japanese company 
hes done a video 
in an 8minute 22second videotape mailed this week to about 
4100 shareholders of koito manufacturing ltd pickens appears on 
horseback wearing a cowboy hat playing racquetball and with his 
family 
pickens claims that the companys unwillingness to seat him on 
koitos board of directors or make other changes that he wants is a 
symbol of japans unwillingness to open its markets to foreign 
competitors 
in the video in which he speaks under the voice of a japanese 
translator the texas oilman appeals for support on seven proposals 
he is asking koito shareholders to adopt at the auto parts 
manufacturers june 28 annual meeting 
finally pickens exhorts koito shareholders to do their part to 
change japans economic system or your children will not find 
opportunities to better their lives 
pickens is koitos largest shareholder with 26 percent of the 
common stock the company has rebuffed him for more than a year 
claiming he is after greenmail in which a company pays a 
shareholder a premium price to fend off a hostile takeover 
the tone of the tape produced at a cost of about 20000 
resembles us political television advertising 
pickens assistant andrew littlefair conceded wednesday that 
the pitch had little chance of success because socalled stable 
shareholders companies such as toyota motor co nissan and 
matsushita electric products co control more than half of koitos 
outstanding stock 
but it would seem to make a statement if a lot of the small 
individual shareholders vote with us littlefair said 
pickens claims he is being blocked by toyota koitos 
secondlargest shareholder and largest customer he also has 
attempted to enlist the us government in his fight claiming he is 
the victim of unfair and illegal barriers to foreign investment in 
japan 
he complains that koito toyota and other companies are members 
of an automotive keiretsu a business group that forces their 
auto parts makers to sell them parts at artificially low prices 
i have discovered something pretty disturbing pickens says 
on the tape the leadership of koito is deliberately keeping us 
out of the global marketplace and holding back financial returns to 
stockholders 
if something isnt done to break down the practice of keiretsu 
things will never change pickens says your children will not 
find opportunities to better their lives eventually since the 
marketplace is becoming increasingly global and competitive they 
may even fall behind 
koito plans to respond with its own proxy statement next week a 
us spokeswoman for the company said 
it sounds like pickens is using pressure tactics to coerce 
koito shareholders and disrupt koito business said a us 
spokeswoman for koito

commerce secretary robert mosbacher signed an 
agreement with the soviets on wednesday to share information on food 
processing 
he said the agreement was a start toward expanding trade between 
the two superpowers 
we are the two largest industrialized nations in the world 
said mosbacher we have one third of the worlds gnp but we do 
only a tiny fraction of world trade we have nowhere to go but 
up 
the agreement mosbacher signed with vladilen nikitin the soviet 
agriculture minister creates a team of us and soviet government 
officials who will study the food processing systems of the two 
countries and determine how us technology and methods can be 
incorporated into the soviet system 
a high proportion of soviet food production has been reported to 
spoil because of inefficient distribution handling and storage 
before it reaches the consumer 
nikitin said the agreement was a small step but everything 
starts with a small step 
for you its a key if you want to participate in the 
strengthening of our economy he said through an interpreter 
the pact was signed on the last day of a threeday conference 
sponsored by the food processing machinery amp supplies association 
and the national food processors association 
fiftyfive soviet officials met with representatives of more than 
50 food companies administration and congressional officials 
seeking deals that could lead to increased business for americans 
and modernization of food distribution for the soviet union 
john cady president of the food processors association said 
barriers are beginning to come down though americans still are 
concerned about getting paid for business with the soviets 
soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market 
leaving those companies doing business in the soviet union to either 
accept products in exchange or wait for longterm gains after the 
economy there improves 
we have to understand when companies invest its not going to 
be a threeyear turnaround but probably eight to 10 years said 
cady

the last bauxite mines in the united states were closed by the 
aluminum company of america after 91 years of operation the company 
said wednesday 
the mines located near little rock ark are adjacent to 
alcoas arkansas operations which includes a bauxite refinery and 
chemical facilities for processing alumina an oxide of aluminum 
present in bauxite 
some of the employees retired and others were laid off when the 
mines closed last week the refining operations also are being shut 
down alcoa said 
the mining and refining operations were ended because the 
reserves of bauxite were no longer economical to mine and refine 
the company said 
the bauxite was used to make about 275000 metric tons of alumina 
a year 
alumina once was used in the production of aluminum but recently 
was used mostly to produce chemicals for cements ceramics fire 
retardants paper and pharmaceuticals the company said 
about 700 employees who will remain at the plant will make 
chemicals from alumina feedstocks from other alcoa locations the 
company said 
the worlds largest reserves of bauxite are in australia brazil

energy futures prices regained some ground 
wednesday aided by technical factors and rumors of a nuclear 
accident in the soviet union 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil rose 24 cents to 1692 a 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange after having lost 82 cents over 
the first two days of the week later months also rose wednesday 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for july delivery which plunged 
nearly 3 cents over monday and tuesday moved 054 cent higher to 
5836 cents a gallon wednesday with subsequent months also advancing 
and the july contract for home heating oil picked up 020 cent to 
settle at 4731 cents a gallon after skidding 162 cents earlier in 
the week later months also advanced wednesday 
analysts said the market opened lower but rumors about a soviet 
nuclear disaster sent prices higher 
the rumors were sparked by the appearance of a dark cloud sighted 
over the western soviet union finnish authorities who were 
monitoring the cloud said it could have been caused by some kind of 
accident or it could just be an ordinary cloud 
traders bought up futures on the theory that if the cloud were 
the result of a nuclear accident the soviets might need other 
sources of energy 
technical buying throughout the day also boosted prices the 
analysts said 
in natural gas trading the july contract declined to 1560 per 
1000 cubic feet from 1567 on tuesday

greyhound refugees left in the dust by a 
3monthold strike of the only nationwide bus line are turning to 
planes trains and automobiles and analysts say the survival of 
coasttocoast bus travel is in jeopardy 
greyhound has vowed to continue service with replacement drivers 
while trying to reorganize its finances under bankruptcy las but 
many people are choosing alternate transportation 
some bus riders are paying more finding it harder to make 
connections and having to stay overnight where the prestrike 
greyhound schedule allowed them to return the same day 
bus industry officials say they see little concern in washington 
over the state of interstate bus travel 
i havent received a single call from any legislator mayor 
governor or anyone complaining about a lack of service because of 
the greyhound strike said wayne j smith executive director of 
the united bus operators of america 
jeremy kahn a washington lawyer who represents scores of bus 
lines said bus travel is ignored because congressmen and 
newspaper people dont ride the bus 
most travelers affected by the strike are rural poor or elderly 
he said this is not a very vocal constituency 
kahn said that whatever results from the strike and mondays 
bankruptcy filing the greyhound of the future will be considerably 
scaled down 
if greyhound goes down it probably will be virtually 
impossible to go from coast to coast by bus said john sim 
another lawyer who has represented bus companies for 40 years 
greyhound says its continuing to run buses to communities that 
provided 98 percent of its revenue last year but the use other 
modes of transportation is increasing 
amtrak ridership is up 12 percent over last year with increases 
of 30 percent or more on some routes spokesman cliff black said 
train travel was booming before the strike but added we have 
gathered some greyhound refugees and made them our own 
car travel is expected to increase 2 percent this summer said 
american automobile association spokesman geoffrey sundstrom but he 
said its impossible to tell how much of that if any will result 
from the greyhound strike 
airline travel is also up and a summer fare war has made some 
trips more affordable for people who might have taken the bus 
several small bus companies report increased ridership 
more than a dozen bus lines have been granted new routes by the 
interstate commerce commission since the strike began 
we were getting a fair share of the traveling public before the 
strike said phil mcbride of peter pan bus lines in springfield 
mass now were getting the lions share 
jim harmon operations manager of cascade trailways in tacoma 
wash said his line which has daily runs to sacramento calif 
used some of its tour buses to serve greyhound routes in the early 
days of the strike 
we backed out when they came back because the market couldnt 
support two of us he said but if greyhound fails cascade is 
ready to run buses to every town greyhound serves in washington he 
said 
while greyhound is the only bus system operating nationwide 
about 200 smaller lines run limited routes most of the other 1800 
lines carry tours and charters overall its a 12 billion industry 
charter lines that can charge more now that greyhound has scaled 
back its lowpriced charter services also are benefiting from the 
strike said industry officials 
but some bus companies say they are hurting because greyhound 
does their ticketing and hasnt been turning over the revenue and 
because the image of bus travel in general has been sullied by 
violence during the greyhound strike 
greyhound and police have reported more than 30 shooting 
incidents involving buses or terminals since the strike began 
in some areas enterprising small businesses have replaced the 
sleek greyhounds with homey little passenger vans that make runs 
like stagecoaches to isolated towns 
when greyhound stopped the buses were able to keep running on 
the freeways but some of the little communities were without bus 
service said lera dwyer of wichita falls texas and ive 
always been serviceoriented 
mrs dwyer who owns skylark transportation said business for 
her has quadrupled since the strike with 10 small vans making daily 
round trips to paris texarkana abilene and stops along the way 
abandoned by greyhound 
but even her company relies on greyhound to make connections for 
passengers and shipments of vital farm machinery parts fresh 
produce that has to arrive overnight thread to keep a clothing 
plant running and valuable bull semen 
it would be a great blow if we lost greyhound everywhere 
mrs dwyer said an awful lot of people who cannot or would not 
fly i dont know how they would get around

edward harshfield the new head of 
columbia savings amp loan association told shareholders bad business 
judgment rather than government intervention wiped out their assets 
harshfield who took over as chief executive three months ago 
did not mention predecessor thomas spiegel by name during his speech 
at the annual shareholders meeting on tuesday 
but he said executives of the thrift put the firm in harms 
way as far back as 1986 long before the collapse of the junk bond 
market 
earnings slipped from 193 million in 1986 to 65 million in 
1988 he said 
the bottom line is that all but 17 million in stockholder 
equity was wiped out not by government action but by the business 
judgements and management actions over those several years he 
said 
columbia which holds an extensive portfolio of the highrisk 
highyield junk bonds reported a 591 million loss in 1989 
the firm must sell its junk bond portfolio once valued at 3 
billion by 1994 to meet tough capital requirements imposed on the 
thrift industry by congress last year 
ed has been here for three months spiegel said after the 
meeting he has his perspective of the situation being here three 
months i have my perspective being here 13 years 
spiegel resigned as chief executive on dec 31 he and his family 
still own about twothirds of columbias common stock

drexel burnham lambert inc on wednesday 
presented creditors with a bankruptcy reorganization plan that 
promises to pay in full the debts of the collapsed wall street firm 
drexel attorneys said the plan envisions creating a separate 
business entity out of drexels junk bond holdings and giving 
creditors an interest equal to their claims 
creditors of the brokerage firm and about a dozen smaller 
subsidiaries of parent drexel burnham lambert group inc would be 
paid in cash drexel attorney alan b miller said creditors of the 
parent and two commodities trading subsidiaries would receive 
promissory notes 
the plan also proposes creating a separate fund for settling more 
than 400 outstanding lawsuits by investors who say they were 
defrauded by trading activities by drexel whose admission to 
securities felonies last year sped the firms demise 
the plan was announced by drexel attorneys at a twohour meeting 
with about 100 creditors and their representatives and was not 
formally entered into bankruptcy court drexels parent filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection in february and its brokerage 
subsidiary followed suit last week 
drexel has said it plans to emerge from bankruptcy court as an 
operating entity on wall street although it is unclear what shape 
the firm would take 
under the reorganization drexel would create a separate business 
entity out of its holdings creditors would receive promissory notes 
valued at the amount of their individual claims and backed by 
drexels assets miller said 
drexel says its holdings are worth about 2 billion but a large 
portion consists of junk bonds the firm has been unable to sell 
because of their low quality and a severe downturn in the highyield 
bond market 
the holdings also include socalled bridge loans which are 
temporary loans made to clients that remain unpaid typically 
because permanent financing has not been obtained 
miller said drexel was confident there would be sufficient 
backing in assets for all our constituents and hopefully value left 
over for our equity shareholders drexel employees owned the 
firms stock the value of which vanished when the firm collapsed 
barry dichter an attorney representing banco de portugal one of 
drexels largest creditors said determining the value of the 
holdings will be the great debating point in this case 
this is really the first step in what will be a lengthy 
negotiation process he said creditors will require a lot more 
information than they now have in order to evaluate the concepts 
that were put forward 
under the proposal creditors would be free to sell their notes 
in the open market if they can find a buyer giving them a way to 
recoup cash for what they are owed drexel attorneys said drexel 
would redeem a small portion of notes periodically or buy them back 
if it had the money 
it was left up in the air how and when drexel planned to value 
the assets in the unit creditors lawyers said they presumed the 
holdings would receive a value at the time drexel files its 
reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court 
drexel would manage the portfolio and be allowed to conduct other 
business activities at the same time but the composition of 
drexels management after it emerges from bankruptcy is an open 
topic for debate miller said 
drexel would seek to liquidate the junk bond holdings for maximum 
value and recoup the outstanding bridge loans from former clients 
we think you could return 80 percent of those bonds probably 
within a twoyear period miller said 
creditors attorney have said they likely would oppose allowing 
current management to be in charge 
another unresolved issue is some 260 million in bonuses that 
drexel paid to executives in the months before the bankruptcy filing 
drexel has requested a 120day extension from a june 13 deadline 
to file a reorganization plan in us bankruptcy court a spokesman 
declined to discuss the plan and drexel attorneys did not 
immediately return calls seeking comment 
the firm which rose to power on wall street by dominating the 
highyield bond business failed to recover from a government 
securities fraud investigation drexel last year pleaded guilty to 
six felonies and agreed to pay 650 million to settle insider 
trading and other allegations 
as of march 30 drexel said it had total assets of 326 billion 
and total liabilities of 28 billion

a federal appeals court wednesday gave 
states the authority to regulate new telephone services such as 
voice mail and computer access a move one baby bell company said 
could raise costs to consumers 
the decision could force the seven regional bell telephone 
companies to set up separate corporate entities to handle their 
regulated telephone services and their newer unregulated services 
officials said 
the 9th circuit court of appeals opinion vacated a 1985 federal 
communications commission rule that had required the baby bells to 
keep finances separate for regulated and unregulated services but 
not create separate corporations seven lawsuits had been filed to 
overturn the rule 
the courts ruling allows each state to decide whether to require 
separate corporations 
the california public utilities commission which filed three of 
the lawsuits against the fcc heralded the decision the plaintiffs 
had contended that the baby bells could have subsidized unregulated 
services by charging higher prices on regulated phone service 
it properly gives the states greater freedom to promote the 
development of enhanced services and the terms and conditions upon 
which those services are provided commission president g 
mitchell wilk said 
steven harris director of planning and policy for pacific bell 
said the company supports state regulation but fears state control 
could lead to a costly corporate division of regulated and 
unregulated services 
its not clear that we are going to have to split off harris 
said its up to the states but we strongly believe that 
independent subsidiaries are not necessary and would make it more 
difficult to provide the services to the public 
an fcc spokeswoman said the opinion is a setback for the 
communications industry 
we adopted the rules because we believed they would be in the 
public interest said spokeswoman jane mago so of course 
were disappointed in the outcome we have to start from scratch 
unregulated communications services have developed rapidly in the 
past 10 years into a multibilliondollar industry that ranges from 
voice and electronic mail to automatic teller machines harris said 
the appeals court ordered the fcc to develop new rules to help 
regulate new telecommunications services offered by the baby bell 
companies 
those companies had been prevented from providing information 
services under a court decree that stripped atampt of its local 
operating companies in january 1984 
later that year the fcc allowed the baby bells to offer 
unregulated services through separate subsidiaries but in 1985 the 
federal agency dropped the requirement for separate subsidiares 
the court said the fcc arbitrarily and capriciously reversed 
itself without showing that costshifting between unregulated and 
regulated services wouldnt occur and raise the bills of captive 
telephone customers 
the record yields no evidence that the bell operating 
companies power to extract monopoly rents from local telephone 
customers has diminished the court said

secretary of transportation samuel k skinner 
said wednesday that approval of a gasoline tax increase by 
california voters validates the administrations argument that 
states can and will raise their taxes to pay for highways and other 
transportation needs 
in a referendum on tuesday californians voted to increase the 
gasoline tax from 9 to 18 cents a gallon to finance a 155 billion 
freeway construction program 
i am delighted with that result said skinner architect of 
the administrations national transportation policy which looks 
largely to state and local financing to meet increasing needs 
he told reporters the california vote shows that states are 
willing to act to meet those costs so long as the voters know where 
their money is going 
i think the best validation of that principle is the vote 
yesterday in california skinner said 
he said the average voter would say no to a gasoline tax increase 
that wasnt earmarked for transportation and yes to one 
specifically targeted for roads bridges and other infrastructure 
needs 
i think thats what happened in california he said 
skinner said he assumed there would be discussion of increases in 
the federal gasoline tax currently 9 cents per gallon during the 
current negotiations on the federal budget and deficit he said he 
does not support or advocate an increase in that tax but when and 
if there is one it also should be earmarked for the infrastructure 
asked to name other states he believes should follow the 
california example skinner said 18 states have increased gas taxes 
in the past year and pointed to new york as one that has not 
he said it should be considered there i think its a good 
potential in a state with major infrastructure needs

armstrong world industries inc and the 
belzberg family have dropped all lawsuits stemming from their 
hostile takeover fight in a settlement that makes the canadian 
family 44 million richer 
under the agreement which armstrong announced wednesday the 
belzberg group will limit its holdings of armstrong stock for a 
period of 10 years to no more than 50000 shares 
the family whose investment vehicle is first city financial 
corp agreed not to interfere in any business aspect of the 
floorcovering company 
we have entered into this agreement because it will put an end 
to the many disruptions caused by the litigation not to mention the 
substantial expense armstrong spokesman john scheldrup said 
now we can devote all our resources and energies to running the 
business which is certainly in the best interests of the 
corporation he said 
last week first city financial corp announced it would abandon 
its bid to acquire the lancaster company 
the pullout came about a month after the belzbergs failed to seat 
three of four nominees on the armstrong board and the state of 
pennsylvania enacted legislation requiring corporate raiders to 
surrender shortterm profits from thwarted takeover bids 
first city said the takeover law and the largely unsuccessful 
proxy fight played a role in the decision 
the agreement calls for first city to pay armstrong 605000 and 
for armstrong to pay first city affiliates 5 million 
the payments are in part reimbursement of first citys expenses 
related to the proxy fight scheldrup said 
in addition the belzbergs have agreed not to pursue their 
petition proposing changes in armstrongs articles of incorporation 
the states antitakeover legislation was drafted last year after 
the belzbergs first disclosed an interest in acquiring the company 
in addition to garnishing raiders profits the law also restricts 
the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor contracts when 
corporations exchange hands

when trump went thump 
its a cash flow problem a slump de trump from trump the 
art of the deal to thump my life as a shlemiel the column 
continued

wednesday while negotiations continued between the developer and his 
creditors we wont be making any statements today said trump 
spokesman dan klores 
his wife ivana was talking wednesday she came to trumps 
defense promising to stand by her estranged husband through thick 
or thin and for better or worse 
trump in need of cash to pay off a reported 30 million debt on 
june 15 could be forced to sell off some assets the trump shuttle 
and the taj mahal casino have been mentioned to make the payment 
in april trump claimed he had no cash flow woes last month that 
turned out to be untrue 
the real estate magnate and casino operator has long been the 
target of trumpbashing even when things were going well spy 
magazine which dubbed trump the shortfingered vulgarian 
mounts monthly attacks at him 
but trumps legal woes have stepped up the pace 
at last all of us whove so loved the game of kicking donald 
trump while hes up will have the fiendish thrill of kicking donald 
trump while he down wrote new york newsday columnist robert reno 
a new york post cartoon showed a bedraggled donald panhandling 
from inside the trump carton 
others suggested the donald might have trumped up his money 
misfortunes to keep his estranged wife ivana from getting too big 
a piece of the pie in any divorce settlement 
a trump stunt asked the daily news which quoted an 
anonymous ivana pal as saying he is just trying to convince ivana 
that he has no money so shell soften up and go easy on him 
newsday raised the same possibility in an editorial titled art 
of the fall 
after all theres always the possibility the donald has pulled 
off the most artful deal of his career could it be an elaborate 
scam to keep the empire out of ivanas hands it asked 
but in a statement issued through her lawyer michael kennedy 
mrs trump made it clear she plans to stand by her man 
donald and i are partners in marriage and in business i will 
stand beside him through thick or thin and for better or worse 
said ivana who was not alone in refusing to kick donald while hes 
down 
strangely enough exmayor ed koch a charter member of the 
down with donald movement declined to join the trumpbashers 
while at city hall koch constantly feuded with trump and trashed 
the multimillionaire developer as piggy piggy piggy 
i dont believe in kicking someone when they are down so i 
have nothing to say about donald trump koch said call me when 
hes back on his feet

help at a closeddoor meeting on may 3 with the feds board of 
governors usa today said in wednesdays edition the newspaper said 
it obtained secret minutes of the meeting 
the bankers suggested that the governors allow banks to take real 
estate losses over a period of years easing the squeeze on bank 
earnings and allowing them more time to set aside reserves the 
newspaper said 
they also suggested relaxing capital rules to allow banks to hold 
and manage troubled real estate loans without a big increase in 
capital the newspaper said

requests some members delivered the suggestion and the governors 
listened intently ronald steinhart chairman of team bank

the federal deposit insurance corp said it had 
declined an unsolicited offer for its 26 percent stake of chicagos 
continental corp a move that angered the banks officials 
fdic spokesman alan whitney on tuesday declined to reveal the 
amount of the offer or the investors who made it except to say they 
included the bank itself and certain members of its management he 
said the offer was made in the last several days 
im dumbfounded that in a little more than six months the fdic 
has passed up two legitimate offers to sell its minority interest in 
continental continental chairman thomas c theobald said tuesday 
not only have they failed to turn their asset into cash but 
their continued ownership in a healthy bank is a wholly unwarranted 
role for a regulator 
the fdic became a shareholder of continental after rescuing the 
former continental illinois national bank and trust co in 1984 the 
rescue was expected at the time to cost the federal agency 45 
billion but continentals return to profitability has drastically 
reduced estimates of the cost 
in a brief announcement from washington the fdic said it had 
rejected the latest offer for its continental holdings but still 
remains committed to realizing full value for them it said it would 
explore all options for divesting its stake 
since the 1984 bailout the fdic has made three sales of its 
continental common stock selling 125 million shares in november 
1986 another 125 million shares in december 1988 and 9 million 
shares in august 1989
