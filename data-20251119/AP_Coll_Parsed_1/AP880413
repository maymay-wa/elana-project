an 18yearold woman has undergone an 
abortion in violation of a court order to prevent her from 
terminating her pregnancy the womans attorneys said wednesday 
the attorneys sent a notice of the abortion to the indiana 
supreme court one day after asking the high court tuesday for an 
immediate review of a vigo circuit court injunction to prohibit an 
abortion 
attorneys for both the woman and her 24yearold boyfriend who 
sought the injunction said they still want the supreme court to 
make a decision on the issues raised by the case the couple are 
from terre haute their names are withheld in court records because 
the case involves a paternity action 
faced with the decision of continuing with an unwanted 
pregnancy and with violating a court order she made the decision 
she felt was right said the notice signed by richard a waples 
an indiana civil liberties union attorney who represented the 
unmarried woman 
she arrived at the decision to terminate her pregnancy after 
consultation with her family and her physician the statement 
said she did what she had to do to protect both her physical and 
emotional health 
james bopp jr who represents the man who claims to be the 
father of the fetus said his client is absolutely devastated 
that his child has been taken from him 
bopp said he and his client havent thought about whether they 
would want vigo circuit court judge robert h brown to issue a 
contempt citation against the woman for violating browns 
injunction brown issued a permanent injunction on monday 
he loves this girl bopp said of his client hes not 
interested in punishing her 
however in a brief filed with the supreme court bopp argued 
that a violation of the injunction should be punishable by a 
contempt of court citation 
waples told the court he wants it to review the case because of 
the issues involved the precedent set by browns injunction and 
potential sanctions against the woman 
if allowed to stand browns ruling invites other indiana 
courts to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiry 
into and overruling of a competent adult womans decision to 
terminate her first trimester pregnancy waples told the court 
the womans attorneys said her first trimester would have ended 
sometime during the next two weeks the attorneys would not divulge 
details of when or where the abortion was performed 
waples argued browns decision violates the 1973 us supreme 
court ruling in roe vs wade which upheld a womans right to an 
abortion during the first three months of a pregnancy 
bopp who is also a general counsel for the national right to 
life organization said he wants a court decision detailing what 
rights a father has in such cases 
fathers have rights in particular cases all we said in this 
case is we want those rights to be balanced against the rights of 
the mother bopp said 
bobb told the supreme court the mothers reasons for wanting 
an abortion are the result of an immature reasoning process are 
insubstantial and border on the frivolous and do not outweigh the 
strong interests of the father in seeing the child born and in his 
custody 
bopps brief described the woman as an unemployed high school 
dropout who began a relationship with the man a delivery truck 
driver following a date on new years eve 
according to the brief browns ruling noted testimony that the 
woman wanted an abortion to preserve her figure so she would look 
good in a bathing suit and to keep from being pregnant during the 
summer

the transportation department worried about 
the financial health of texas air corp launched an investigation 
wednesday into the finances and management of the nations largest 
airline company 
in a separate action the federal aviation administration levied 
a proposed 823000 in fines against a texas air subsidiary 
eastern airlines for violating safety regulations and said it has 
begun a new round of safety inspections of the miamibased air 
carrier 
in announcing the twopronged action against the houstonbased 
airline company transportation secretary jim burnley said the 
departments concerns were raised by evidence that eastern and 
continental airlines also owned by texas air are under 
substantial increasing financial pressure 
the department wants to determine if texas air and its 
management are fit willing and able to carry commercial air 
traffic burnley said at a news conference also attended by faa 
administrator allan mcartor 
in a statement texas air called the federal probe union 
inspired and suggested the transportation department only had 
reacted to union leaders who have mounted a continuing 
campaign of distortion and lies about safety at both eastern and 
continental 
texas air remains financially strong with over 850 million in 
cash at the end of the first quarter the statement said 
but on wall street word of the federal investigation caused 
texas air stock to drop more than 1 a share to 1075 on the 
american stock exchange the stock closed at 1087 down 87 
cents from tuesday 
texas air corp had record losses of 466 million last year and 
its eastern subsidiary has been plagued with labor turmoil in 
addition to eastern and continental the company also owns a number 
of commuter carriers 
in recent months there has been increasing sentiment in congress 
for a closer examination of texas air whose airlines have nearly 
onefifth of the commercial airline market in the country a 
resolution which would have urged such a probe has gained the 
support of more than 150 congressmen 
the 823000 civil penalty against eastern comes 14 months after 
eastern agreed to pay 95 million in penalties because of earlier 
safety infractions faa officials said the latest fine stems from 
record keeping and maintenance infractions similar to those found 
in the earlier action 
the fine is based on findings from an investigation last 
september and october but eastern now has an opportunity to 
challenge it if the airline can produce evidence the faa considers 
valid the fine could be reduced 
mcartor said the new faa review was being conducted because of 
concern about the continuing pattern of fines safety violations 
and apparent insensitivity of some of easterns officials to faa 
safety regulations 
he also said the agency would examine its own routine inspection 
of eastern because of what appears to be recurring trends of 
noncompliance to faa regulations at the airline which is the 
countrys sixth largest 
in miami phil bakes easterns president called the latest faa 
action unfair and disparate and alleged that it was prompted by 
pressure from unions representing disgruntled eastern employees 
the faa inspection would include an examination of each of 
easterns 267 aircraft over the next 30 days at airport ramps where 
eastern flies officials said 
burnley and mcartor nevertheless said they are confident that 
both eastern and continental airlines are safe to fly burnley said 
he would not hesitate to use either air carrier adding that if 
circumstances were otherwise the faa would take actions to ground 
the airline 
easterns problems with the faa in part prompted the broader 
investigation into texas airs financial and management practices 
but department officials said that recent filings by texas air 
with the securities and exchange commission also suggested the need 
for the department to take a closer look at the financial fitness 
of both continental and eastern as well as its parent company 
the recent activities of the texas air corp and its carriers 
particularly continental and eastern raise questions concerning 
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety 
and economic rules applicable to air carriers the department 
said in its order for an investigation 
it said that a number of financial transactions between texas 
air and the two subsidiary airlines raise questions concerning 
whether substantial funds and other resources are being diverted 
from the air carrier subsidiaries 
the department questioned for example 
texas air shifting easterns profitable computer reservation 
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note which 
may be less than the systems fair market value 
eastern paying substantial fees for management services 
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company 
eastern accepting a nointerest note instead of cash for 16 
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its 
acquisition by texas air 
texas air borrowing 25 million from eastern in march 1987 in 
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when eastern was having 
cash flow problems 
b wayne vance the departmemts general counsel said 15 to 20 
government economists and auditors will focus on texas air corps 
financial records management practices and the financial 
relationships between the airline subsidiaries and their parent 
company 
in addition to eastern and continental texas air corp also 
owns rocky mountain airways britt airways bar harbor airlines and 
provincetownboston airlines

a sandinista negotiator on wednesday 
accused the contras of maneuvering to avoid a permanent ceasefire 
and keep receiving us aid 
we have serious doubts they want to enter into a definitive 
ceasefire deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco told a 
news conference 
they simply want to move into zones which means gains for them 
without a threat with security and to gain the release of 50 
percent of the prisoners american aid and participation in 
politics 
there was no immediate response from the rebels the government 
and contras have been arguing by letter about ceasefire talks 
jeopardizing a meeting set for friday that would be their first in 
managua since the war began in 1981 
the contras suggested in a letter wednesday that a meeting on 
implementation of the ceasefire be held thursday at sapoa a 
southern border post where a provisional truce was signed march 23 
and they threatened to boycott the friday meeting in the capital 
earlier this week they wanted the technical meeting held wednesday 
in a letter sent tuesday night to contra leaders in miami 
officials of the leftist sandinista government said talks on 
technical aspects of the truce should be held in managua on 
wednesday and that fridays highlevel meeting should go ahead as 
planned 
nicaraguan officials and the ussupported rebels also disagree 
on where contra delegates should stay while in managua and what 
they should be allowed to do 
the technical talks in sapoa broke down last friday after six 
rounds in which the two sides agreed only on seven zones to which 
contra fighters would be confined during the 60day truce 
still to be worked out are security for the rebels in those 
zones methods of resupplying them and other details of their 
existence during the two months allowed for negotiating a permanent 
ceasefire 
rebel fighters had been scheduled to be in the zones by this 
friday but they have not even begun gathering officials say they 
will free a second group of political prisoners when the contras 
are in the zones 
nicaragua is estimated to have more than 3000 political 
prisoners the sandinistas released 100 soon after the provisional 
truce was signed 
the truce began april 1 since then the sides have exchanged 
heated arguments but reached no agreement on ways to end the war 
on wednesday the contras said in a letter to defense minister 
humberto ortega that the friday meeting was subject to the 
results of the technical meetings at sapoa they contend there is 
nothing for leaders to discuss until the mechanical operation 
of the zones is resolved 
rebel leaders adolfo calero and pedro joaquin chamorro signed 
the letter which said the contra delegation had reservations at 
the intercontinental hotel in downtown managua the sandinistas 
want the contras at a governmentowned hotel near the airport 
because it has all the necessary requirements 
calero and chamorro said contra delegates also demand the 
freeedom to meet with civic and political organizations during 
their three days in managua 
sandinista officials say the truce agreement makes clear that 
contras can enter political life only after their combatants are in 
the ceasefire zones

a downtown theater operator said wednesday he 
is yanking the controversial film colors which is about street 
gangs because his staff is afraid it will draw violence 
the staff at the theater were in a panic because the home turf 
of one of the gangs in the movie is just a couple of miles from 
downtown said bob laemmle coowner of the popular laemmle 
theater chain 
the movie which stars sean penn and robert duvall as los 
angeles policemen battling street gangs is set to open friday it 
was scheduled to be shown at the laemmle grand which is downtown 
next to a luxury hotel 
the fact that a movie theater two days before decides not 
to play a motion picture that happens all the time said joel 
resnick in charge of distribution for orion pictures he said 
about 70 theaters in the greater los angeles area will show the 
film 
before a screening of the film wednesday director dennis hopper 
said there is nothing in this film that glorifies being in a 
gang he added that the film story is told from police officers 
point of view 
i dont know how people can twist it around and say im 
glorifying gangs 
however the beverly hillshollywood chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people joined the chorus 
objecting to the film opening in los angeles during a period of 
heightened tension over gang violence 
nearly 100 people have been killed this year in gangrelated 
violence in los angeles county last year there were 387 
gangrelated killings 
the balance between civil order and disorder in this city 
today is tenuous at best and we feel that a release of this film 
may result in more lost of young lives said naacp chapter 
president willis edwards

eli bradley jr admits he sampled one or 
two grapes at a grocery store the prosecutor says bradley ate 2 
pounds of grapes and felony charges are being pressed 
bradley said it was ridiculous to be charged with larceny from a 
building a felony punishable by up to four years in prison 
instead of the lesser charge of shoplifting which carries a 90day 
jail term 
if id known i wouldve made them take me straight to the 
hospital and had my stomach pumped said bradley 52 of summit 
township my only proof was in my stomach 
bradley was arraigned last week in district court on the felony 
charge he was released on 10000 personal bond pending 
preliminary examination april 19 
bradley had bought 14 worth of fruit including two bags of 
grapes and was leaving the store march 4 when a security guard 
stopped him 
they told me to come on back inside and called the police 
bradley said i told them youve got to be kidding me i 
didnt eat more than one or two i even offered them a dollar 
bradley said the guard might have mistakenly thought he was 
concealing a mouthful of grapes he said his front teeth had been 
knocked out by a cue stick leaving the exposed nerves sensitive to 
air 
i cover my mouth so the air doesnt hurt maybe they thought i 
was eating grapes he said 
bradley said he thought the case was closed after police 
questioned him at the scene but jackson county prosecutor joseph 
filip later issued a felony warrant for bradleys arrest 
filip said although 2 pounds of grapes are worth only about 2 
he filed the felony charge because several repeat shoplifters hes 
prosecuted have received probation

collegians who raise their steins to the

song instead as they sing a dry version of the song made famous

i respect your right to go drink your brains out but the 
university shouldnt encourage it said university of maine 
computer science professor george narkowsky who wants to delete 
all references to drinking and sexism from the lyrics 
for decades students at university events have sung fill 
your steins to dear old maine shout till the rafters ring stand 
and drink a toast once again let every loyal maine man sing 
instead of filling steins narkowsky suggests raise a song to 
dear old maine he would like to forget the toast and instead 
stand and sing an ode once again and let every loyal maine 
grad not man sing 
vallee attended the university in the 20s and made the song a 
hit in the 30s narkowskys version is to go before an asyet 
unchosen committee that will recommend whether the changes are in 
order 
there are strong feelings on both sides of the issue its the 
only school fight song to ever make the top 40 said tom 
caulfield a junior who calls the proposed word changes stupid

the armys problem with aging chemical weapons 
is likely to worsen in future years unless the outdated stockpile 
is destroyed say officials who report that more than 1000 of the 
weapons have sprung leaks 
army officials who reported the figure on tuesday said it 
represents only a small percentage of the american arsenal but 
sen john glenn dohio was still worried 
thats frightening 1000 leakers he said thats a 
serious problem 
army officials agreed with glenn when he said the problem is 
not going to get less as the stockpile already averaging 25 
years old continues to age 
acting on congressional orders the army has come up with a plan 
to destroy the chemical weapons at the eight us sites where they 
are stored but plans for local burning in closed incinerators face 
some opposition army officials said 
the leaking weapons are quickly enclosed in newer safer 
containers brig gen david nydam told the senate armed services 
subcommittee on strategic weapons 
nydam said the number of leaking weapons is only a small 
percentage of the total us stockpile but he declined to 
publicize the size of the stockpile telling the subcommittee the 
figure is classified published reports have estimated the 
stockpile by weight at between 25000 and 40000 tons 
the current us stockpile which was built before 1969 
consists of unitary weapons which include artillery shells and 
bombs filled with a variety of chemicals and nerve gases 
the army is now starting to manufacture newer chemical weapons 
known as binary weapons because they are composed of two chemicals 
kept separate until the shell is fired or bomb is dropped 
as part of the compromise that ended a long fight with congress 
over whether to build new chemical weapons the army agreed to come 
up with a plan to destroy the old stockpile the incineration plan 
will cost 27 billion and take until 1997 service officials said 
army officials say almost all the current stockpile is so old 
that the weapons are militarily useless 
the weapons are stored at the aberdeen proving ground md 
anniston army depot ala lexingtonblue grass army depot ky 
newport army ammunition plant ind pine bluff arsenal ark 
pueblo army depot colo tooele army depot utah and umatilla 
army depot ore 
us chemical weapons are also based in west germany and stored 
on johnston atoll a deserted island about 400 miles south of 
hawaii 
the army says the safest method of destruction is incineration 
in closed containers at the eight sites a plan opposed by 
communities in some of the areas 
john shannon assistant secretary of the army said residents of 
the areas around the aberdeen newport and lexington storage sites 
have objected to the incineration plans at the other five sites 
he said residents have expressed the desire that we get on with 
it 
shannon was told by sen daniel quayle rind that the army 
should do a better job of selling its plan to the public 
theres been some progress in swaying public opinion but 
weve got a long way to go quayle said we in the senate 
become involved when our constituency feels it is shortchanged 
shannon admitted mistakes were made at the site in quayles 
state we did not do a good job in newport in the beginning he 
said well have to do better 
other destruction options considered by the army included 
transportation of all the weapons by rail to tooele where they 
would be burned or transportation of some to tooele and others to 
anniston but both those plans involve movement of the weapons 
through at least 16 other states and opposition would likely 
surface in some of those states shannon said

offices of a studio producing a movie they say glorifies gangs 
police said tuesday the teenager was arrested monday and will 
be charged with murder the youth was not identified because he is 
a juvenile but police said he is a known gang member

task force that hit the streets last weekend and arrested 1453 
people 794 of them gang members

estimated nightly cost of 150000 have helped disrupt gang 
activity and heighten public awareness

118 cases submitted from the sweeps arrests a ratio reiner said is 
about average for felony cases the others were rejected for 
insufficient evidence said deputy district attorney stephen kay

after allegedly pushing and tackling security guards and were 
being held on 500 bail each said police sgt bp kelepecz

believes the film may galvanize public support for the war on gangs 
this is not west side story revisited reiner said of the 
movie these are not darlings who are going to dance their way 
into your heart these are sociopathic killers

a key legal decision puts the national 
archives one step closer to letting the public see presidential 
papers that richard m nixon wants kept secret 
the decision tuesday by the us court of appeals in washington 
knocks down a reagan administration attempt to force the archives 
to honor automatically all nixon claims of executive privilege 
it restores a regulation that says an archives review board will 
study disputes over executive privilege claimed by nixon and that 
the former president must go to court if he wants to overturn a 
board decision 
although 3 million pages of nixon documents have been opened to 
researchers nixon and his lawyers have been able to withhold 
150000 documents by claiming they involved executive privilege 
private political associations personal property or personal 
privilege 
a representative of nixons lawyers spent three years in the 
archives warehouse in alexandria va identifying documents to be 
excluded from public view the requests for exemption from 
disclosure totaled 3100 pages and the protected papers represent 
about 10 percent of the 15 million pages in the socalled nixon 
special files which contained the most sensitive documents 
the justice department did not decide immediately whether to 
carry the case to the supreme court weve got 90 days to make 
any decision said michael carvin a justice department lawyer 
who helped prepare the appeal of a lower court decision 
gary brooks legal counsel for the archives said processing of 
nixon documents had continued while the case was in the court the 
archives must now set up a presidential materials review board 
consisting of the archivist two assistant archivists the legal 
counsel and a historian of a federal agency 
the problem is nixons objections tend to overlap brooks 
said on one document there may be three different types of 
objections 
congress seized the papers 42 million pages and 880 tape 
recordings in 1974 after nixon resigned from the presidency the 
act directed that they be made public to disclose the full 
truth about watergate 
there followed years of legal wrangling over access regulations 
five sets of rules were invalidated for various reasons when the 
sixth set the regulations now in effect was presented to the 
reagan administration the justice departments office of legal 
counsel added what the court called its gloss to the rules 
the olc demanded that if either an incumbent president or nixon 
were to claim executive privilege for any document the archivist 
would be obliged to honor that claim the rule put the burden of 
challenging that decision on the person requesting the material 
tuesdays action reverses that procedure 
ronald reagan not richard nixon is the constitutional 
superior of the archivist the court said in its ruling ronald 
reagan has the constitutional power to direct the archivist not 
richard nixon 
the ruling said nixon must ask to withhold documents on a 
disclosurebydisclosure basis it also rejected nixons claim 
that someone requesting the materials must show a particular need 
for them 
the opinion was written by circuit judge laurence silberman a 
reagan administration appointee who has supported expanding 
executive branch authority since joining the court most recently 
he wrote an opinion striking down the law providing that 
independent counsels rather than the justice department would 
investigate executive branch officials accused of wrongdoing

the question for michael dukakis this week is 
the classic one for a frontrunner it is not how can he win the 
new york primary but how could he lose it 
the answer of course is very easily presidential politics 
is a particularly uncertain occupation and much can happen before 
next tuesdays primary 
but now the massachusetts governor is looking strong in the 
empire state 
for the first time outside of new england dukakis is showing 
the depth and breadth of support that a politician needs to become 
the democratic partys presidential nominee 
and his rivals jesse jackson and albert gore jr are 
fighting powerful negative feelings among democratic voters in new 
york that make it difficult for either to catch dukakis 
there are seven days of intensive media coverage of every 
candidates utterance left before the ballots are cast and the 
candidates are spending millions of dollars on television ads to 
reach the voters 
a major gaffe could wipe out dukakis lead or a particularly 
compelling move by gore or jackson could sway the voters into their 
column 
the latest marist institute poll taken april 56 gave dukakis 
a 4731 lead over jackson with gore picking up only 6 percent an 
uncommitted slate drew 8 percent 6 percent were undecided and the 
remainder were scattered 
its what i call the 2020 question said pollster lee 
miringoff at marist college if jackson gets 20 percent of the 
white vote and gore and uncommitted together get 20 percentthen 
youve got a dead heat for dukakis and jackson 
in the marist poll dukakis drew 60 percent of the likely white 
voters jackson 14 percent gore 8 percent and uncommitted 6 
percent 
gore is the wild card miringoff said 
in a state as diverse as new york one can always quibble about 
this or that finding in a poll 
for example jackson gets only 80 percent of the black vote 
in the survey of 408 likely democratic voters exit polls have 
shown him getting closer to 95 percent of the black vote this year 
if one gave jackson every single black voter in the marist 
survey it would narrow the gap to about 4535 for dukakis 
if black voters actually total more than the 22 percent of the 
likely electorate in the marist survey that would cut dukakis 
margin further 
and then one must look at the jewish turnout which usually runs 
a fifth to a fourth of the democratic primary voters 
here it is gore who has not done as well thus far as he must 
despite his effort to cast himself as the strongest friend of 
israel in the contest the tennessee senator drew the backing of 13 
percent of the jewish voters while dukakis took 69 percent 
jackson has a particular problem with the jewish vote because 
his statements on the palestinian question and dealings with arab 
leaders have caused some to suggest that jackson is antisemitic 
jackson and his supporters strongly reject such 
characterizations but those deep feelings against him are a 
problem in new york 
dukakis strength in new york is also reflected in the breadth 
of his support 
the massachusetts governor wins the moderates and conservatives 
and splits the liberals with jackson he holds majorities in the 
new york city suburbs and upstate again he splits new york city 
with jackson 
he is leading among the twothirds of the likely voters who are 
not in union households and runs even with jackson among the union 
members 
dukakis leads among each income group except the poorest likely 
voters 
the good news for dukakis actually stretches beyond new york 
provided he wins on april 19 the massachusetts governor is 
looking good in the big states coming up next on the primary 
calendar 
he is leading in the polls for pennsylvanias april 26 primary 
dukakis could get an added bonus there since the states process 
of voting directly for delegates favors a strong organization 
offering him a chance for a big delegate win that is all but 
impossible to achieve in most states 
dukakis is also leading in the polls on ohios may 3 primary 
where jackson has had some ballot troubles with his delegate slates

charges of deception are flying between safety 
advocates and audi importers following a consumer coalitions 
request that all 50 states prohibit advertisements claiming that 
the cars are unusually safe 
three consumer groups made the request in petitions sent tuesday 
to the attorney general in each of the states 
the center for auto safety of washington the audi victims 
network of plainview ny and the new york public interest 
research group said audi of america misled consumers in 
advertisements published in march and april declaring the audi 5000 
is among the safest cars in the us 
we ask that you put an end to this deceptive advertising by 
audi said the petitions 
the organizations said at least one out of every 145 audi 5000s 
sold in the united states has experienced sudden acceleration 
problems in which the car accelerates for no apparent reason 
audis us parent company volkswagen of america inc in turn 
accused the safety advocates of distorting numbers to mislead the 
public 
it is bloody near criminal the way theyre playing with 
numbers said joseph bennett volkswagen spokesman in troy mich 
thats a baldfaced lie and they know it 
audi last year recalled 255336 of its 197886 audi 5000s for 
installation of a shiftlock device to fix reported throttle 
problems on the cars the devices keeps a driver from putting the 
car in gear unless the brake is depressed 
the consumers groups allege driver complaints show the device 
doesnt prevent unintended acceleration 
they said each incident of unintended acceleration carries 
with it the potential for loss of life and serious injuries 
indeed already at least five people have died and over 2000 have 
had the daylights scared out of them as a result of audis running 
amuck 
bennett argued that a complaint of sudden acceleration does not 
necessarily mean such a problem actually occurred 
the company in documents filed this week with national highway 
traffic safety administration analyzed 394 reports of unintended 
acceleration involving cars equipped with the shiftlock device it 
said it found that all but 22 of the reports were flawed

a wideopen race for the senates top 
democratic leadership post is developing in the wake of majority 
leader robert c byrds decision to step aside after a decade as 
his partys chief senate strategist 
three senators immediately announced their intentions to 
campaign to succeed the west virginia democrat 
byrd 70 announced on tuesday that he will seek election to a 
sixth senate term and if he wins and his party retains senate 
control use his seniority to claim the chairmanship of the senate 
appropriations committee 
there is much to accomplish for my state in that capacity 
byrd said 
many in the chamber praised the work byrd has done as democratic 
leader since 1977 noting his widely acknowledged mastery of the 
legislative process but a number of democrats also agreed it was 
time for a change byrd in recent years has been criticized by some 
democrats for his leadership style and for lacking a slick 
television image 
with the retirement of other senior democrats this year byrd 
will become his partys most senior member and serve as the 
chambers president pro tem if democrats retain majority control 
i believe i have been fair firm and honest and i have done 
my best byrd told his fellow democrats through a decade of 
quiet labor i have led my party from the ambivalence of the carter 
years through the extremes of the reagan administration 
announcing their candidacies for the leadership post to be 
decided after the november elections were sens george mitchell 
dmaine daniel inouye dhawaii and j bennett johnston dla 
several senators said there is no clear frontrunner 
inouye who holds the democrats no 3 leadership position said 
his prospects are very good despite criticism that while 
serving as chairman of the senate irancontra committee last summer 
he permitted lt col oliver l north to steal the show 
johnston who challenged byrd in 1986 but dropped out when it 
became clear he could not win said he is very encouraged even 
though he does not yet have enough votes to win 
no one does johnston said 
the majority leader of the senate is the controlling partys 
chief strategist and spokesman and johnston called the job an 
opportunity without parallel 
despite grumbling about his image byrd told reporters he had 
great confidence he could have won because i know where the votes 
are 
but according to congressional sources byrd had told some 
senators in 1986 that if they supported him for the post then he 
would step aside when the twoyear term expired 
byrd said he had agonized over the decision until the last 
moment not making up his mind until late monday night 
he told his colleagues he had tried to give the senate a voice 
of resonance and power in the nations affairs 
many senators said they believed he had accomplished that 
but many also said they thought it was time for a change 
sen john melcher dmont told reporters the likelihood of 
byrds running again seemed to fade over the past year 
at the moment melcher added there is no clear indication of 
who might be first or second or even last 
sen frank lautenberg dnj said the time for change i 
think is appropriate 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said byrd made himself 
the grand master of senate rules and procedure 
he is one tough ball carrier for his party dole said 
paul g kirk jr chairman of the democratic national committee 
said that when democrats lost control of the senate in the 1980 
byrd helped fashion and execute a legislative strategy that 
moderated the excesses of ronald reagan george bush and the 
radical right 
since he first entered the senate 30 years ago byrd forged a 
reputation as a courtly master parliamentarian who revered the 
senate and its history and gained power inch by inch by attending 
to his colleagues smallest wishes 
he called in those favors in 1971 ousting sen edward m 
kennedy dmass from the no 2 party post byrd succeeded sen 
mike mansfield dmont as majority leader in 1977

greekamericans in upstate new york 
state are doing just as their counterparts elsewhere in the united 
states and rallying behind the presidential campaign of one of 
their own michael dukakis 
if a man is good in his work native greeks theyll always 
stick with him said peter apostol a 72yearold greekamerican 
who works for his son in a restaurant supply business in green 
island 
i think its strong said the son michael 42 of the 
grassroots sentiment for dukakis i think a lot of greeks are 
donating money a lot are excited that one of our own is running 
the greeks would like to see a greekamerican and an ethnic a 
hyphenatedamerican in control of the presidency its no 
different than why blacks support jesse jackson 
dukakis the son of immigrants will get a big boost from 
greekamericans who are also registered democrats in new yorks 
primary on tuesday and should he be the partys nominee in the 
general election in november some republicans and independents say 
they will cross over to vote for him just because hes greek 
among those ready to bolt the gop for dukakis is jimmy londis 
64 who came to the united states from greece 30 years ago and runs 
the popular jimmys lunch in troy known for its french toast 
i feel very warm about him said londis hes the right 
kind of person hes a good governor if its going to be jesse 
jackson and george bush ive got to vote republican 
the rev emmanuel mantzouris pastor of st basil greek orthodox 
church in troy whose congregation numbers about 250 said many 
greeks are politically oriented just knowing hes greek draws 
their attention somebody being greek in the limelight 
as much as 25 percent of the 15 million that dukakis has raised 
in campaign funds has come from greekamericans estimated to 
number one million 
a lot about the dukakis candidacy stimulates 
greekamericans says elias vlanton information director of the 
american hellenic educational progressive association he invokes 
his greek heritage and the values that greeks hold dear love of 
family the need and importance of public service 
paul brountas a greekamerican who is dukakis national 
campaign chairman acknowledges there may be some voters who will 
support him just because of his heritage but just the same he 
says dukakis has to prove himself on the issues first 
theres no automatic vote or contribution to dukakis just 
because hes greek says brountas i believe the majority of 
greek supporters hear his message the gap between what you know 
about a candidate and dont know is often bridged either by 
familiarity or a tie so he starts with the heritage connection 
one ardent supporter john oureilidis a 40yearold bowling 
equipment supplier from troy believes what dukakis says 
plus hes greek says oureilidis he talks sense nobody 
talks about poor people like he does i believe he can do it hes 
our boy so we have to vote for him 
but still there are some dissenters among greekamericans like 
michael wilson 31 who is in the printing business and his 
brother george 29 a continuity director for a radio station in 
schenectady both are diehard republicans and for good reason in 
1984 before moving to schenectady michael wilson was chairman of 
the fulton county reaganbush committee

jesse jackson is mounting his first major 
television drive of the presidential campaign season for next 
weeks new york primary and hell kick it off with an antidrug ad 
produced by filmmaker spike lee 
jackson spokesman eric easter said tuesday that the campaign 
expects to purchase tv time worth about 500000 10 times more 
than what jackson spent on media for the april 5 wisconsin primary 
in which he placed second 
we plan to run a number of commercials easter said we 
havent decided which ones to use and when to run them weve just 
decided a ballpark figure on how much were willing to spend 
despite the huge jump in jacksons media spending the civil 
rights activist probably wont match the tv effort planned by 
tennessee sen albert gore jr gore spokesman mark armour said the 
campaign had made a third media buy tuesday and were still 
intending to run a millionplus campaign in new york 
steve akey a spokesman for massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
declined to say how much the campaign is spending other than that 
we can be and we will be competitive with everybody in new york 
asked if dukakis would match or outspend his rivals akey 
replied its not always necessary we didnt spend the most 
money in wisconsin you have to be very careful about targeting 
your dollar 
jackson has relied mainly on energetic campaigning and heavy 
news coverage in past contests but he took in more than 2 million 
in march after strong showings in several states assuring him the 
means to project a stronger media presence in the expensive and 
highstakes new york contest 
the new jackson ad shot monday shows jackson and lee walking 
down a new york street lee comments on the sad state of the 
neighborhood and the devastating impact of drugs on the streets 
and jackson responds with a discussion of his antidrug positions 
according to easter in lees movie shes gotta have it 
lees character mentions having met jackson and told him to run for 
president lee has been a jackson supporter for some time 
easter said other new ads would be made from filming done last 
week while jackson was campaigning in brooklyn he said the 
campaign may also use endorsement spots that have proven effective 
in the past one by entertainer bill cosby and another by a farmer 
who says jackson helped him save his farm 
gore had been running a biographical ad another stressing his 
experience as a vietnam veteran and a third proposing that the 
military be mobilized to fight drugs armour said the biography was 
pulled tuesday and a new ad on trade was scheduled to start upstate 
and downstate on tuesday night 
dukakis on a roll after trouncing jackson in wisconsin was 
running three ads throughout new york one of them a biography one 
emphasizing his experience as a chief executive and the third 
emphasizing the war against drugs 
the second a variation on a spot he has used in several states 
says he is the only candidate to have balanced a budget created 
new jobs built affordable housing and provided job training and 
child care 
the third which began airing on tuesday included excerpts from 
a speech in which dukakis attacked the reagan administrations 
support until recently of panamanian military strongman manuel 
antonio noriega 
how can we tell our children to say no to drugs when we have 
an administration that paid 200000 a year to a drugpeddling 
dictator from panama dukakis says

millions of afghan refugees heading home when 
soviet troops withdraw will need united nationsrun relief services 
because of continued upheaval in afghanistan us officials say 
further mediation efforts also will be needed to arrange an 
interim government to replace the sovietbacked regime according 
to the officials a constructive effort is taking place to work 
out an interim government and to help the refugees return in safety 
and honor state department spokesman charles e redman said 
tuesday 
the process has to be done in such a way that its done 
securely that these people are taken care of he said 
there is obviously going to be some social disorganization 
inside afghanistan as this proceeds he said we need to try to 
do this in a coordinated way 
he said the united nations is the logical organization to 
coordinate the work 
refugee resettlement and political maneuvering to set the shape 
of future rule in afghanistan have emerged as the next major issues 
in the region as the estimated 115000 soviet troops prepare to 
withdraw 
under accords to be signed in geneva on thursday the troops 
will be out of the country by early next year ending an eightyear 
soviet military domination of the afghan government 
the accords to be signed at a ceremony attended by secretary of 
state george p shultz also envision a nonaligned afghanistan 
the return of the refugees and a peaceful afghanpakistani border 
diego cordovez the united nations mediator who led the 
settlement discussions is expected to continue in a private 
capacity to work for a further understanding between the 
usbacked afghan guerrillas and the sovietsponsored government 
in kabul 
complicating the problem is a superpower agreement to continue 
aiding their clients in the country after the soviet troops 
withdraw 
the united states had hoped to reach agreement with the soviets 
to cut all aid to the belligerents but when moscow insisted on its 
right to assist the kabul government the united states said it 
would continue helping the resistance forces 
president reagan sought on tuesday to assure a group of us 
supporters of the afghan resistance that the american commitment 
would continue after the soviets withdraw 
the president told us repeatedly and in very definitive terms 
that he is going to stand by the afghan freedom fighters no matter 
what said paul weyrich president of the free congress 
foundation leaders of the afghan insurgents have vowed to continue 
the war and with the spring thaw opening mountain supply routes 
western diplomats in pakistan have reported an increase in military 
activity in afghanistan 
renewed fighting has been reported near the large cities of 
kandahar and khost and soviet army forces continue to operate in 
strength the diplomats said 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said continued fighting would affect the return of the refugees 
but one expert said the removal of soviet forces from the fray 
would spark a massive return 
the likelihood of continued violence does not frighten the 
afghan people this official said 
what made them flee in the first place was not the violence 
it was the magnitude of the violence namely attacks from the 
soviet air force napalm attacks helicopter raids on villages 
when that ends they will want to return he said

academic year for making racial slurs to a black student a 
university spokesman said tuesday 
university president andrew de rocco ordered the two students to 
leave the campus by 5 pm wednesday said spokesman stewart dyke 
the students had been found guilty by the universitys judicial 
board of harassing aaron laramore a black senior by pounding on 
the wall of his dormitory room and yelling racial epithets the two 
students live adjacent to laramore 
the board had ordered the white students suspended for the 
coming fall semester but black students claimed that punishment 
was too lenient and called for a boycott of classes and organized 
protest rallies the suspension remains in effect dyke said

cable mogul ted turner has more on his mind 
these days than making money hes hoping to save mankind from 
nuclear destruction 
turners better world society founded in 1985 is sponsoring a 
series of television programs on such subjects as overpopulation 
and nuclear proliferation and the most recent is the terror 
trade buying the bomb airing tonight and again saturday on 
superstation tbs 
the content of the onehour documentary is impressive not to 
mention scary 
the centerpiece is an interview with eric a man who claims 
to be a former arms dealer who traded in blackmarket plutonium 
sought by many third world nations as well as terrorist 
organizations wanting to build their own nuclear weapons 
george case the british investigative reporter who reported and 
coproduced the documentary says erics credibility was verified 
by the us drug enforcement agency for whom he once worked as an 
informant 
at one point eric describes a flea market at a hotel in 
khartoum sudan where 12 kilos of stolen weaponsgrade plutonium 
were up for sale stored at the airport not in the hotel buyers 
eric said came from south africa libya israel iraq iran 
pakistan argentina and the palestine liberation organization 
eric said he was negotiating on behalf of south africa and 
unsuccessfully offered 5 million a kilo for the stuff he said he 
heard later that the plutonium was sold to iraq a few months after 
the sale in june 1981 israeli jets destroyed an iraqi nuclear 
research plant 
richard perle former assistant secretary of defense in the 
reagan administration is interviewed and says that while other 
countries publicly deplored the israeli attack many nations 
privately applauded it 
other officials interviewed include former president jimmy 
carter and former cia director stansfield turner 
the documentary suggests that ussoviet cooperation is the 
best way to stop proliferation 
turner said he thinks its a simple case of us and soviet 
leadership 
that threats always there we can nuke you and you cant 
nuke us back and it really makes the little countries angry 
said turner thats the ultimate status symbol in the world 
today its just awful we set a terrible example us and the 
soviets but the soviets want to get rid of nuclear weapons and so 
does the better world society at least the chairman does 
turner he created the society to finance controversial 
television projects about world population problems and the nuclear 
threat that couldnt draw advertisers 
ive got five children he said humanity is the most 
endangered species on the planet and it bothers the devil out of 
me ive just got a lot of pride i like to see things better i go 
around pickin up trash on my places on the weekend it kills me to 
see the trash on the side of the highway 
and to see all the wonderful people in this world ive been 
over to the soviet union and met the people over there and theyre 
just as nice as the people here in the united states and thats 
true of the people in iran and israel and everywhere its all 
misunderstanding thats all it is 
turners simplistic approach to world peace isnt always 
successful the sevenpart series inside the soviet union was 
largely dismissed by critics as too naive showing lots of happy 
soviets and ignoring serious issues such as religious suppression 
and persecution of those who seek to emigrate 
turner insisted that was the aim of the program to counteract a 
negative soviet image in the united states 
turner feels so strongly about world peace he has directed that 
his cable news network in news reports use the term 
international instead of than foreign 
its not really foreign its news from other parts of the 
earth he said we really should save the word foreign for 
meteorites and things that come from outer space because nothing 
is foreign on this planet weve already done it at cnn 
international instead of foreign

twice in the past week small groups of academics 
have staged protests on tiananmen square in central beijing 
daringly placing their careers on the line 
their message to the government give more money to education 
one group came with shoeshine kits to parody government 
suggestions that students and faculty work to supplement the 
schools meager budgets 
another group came with signs in english and chinese saying 
we want more money for education 
at beijing university chinas most prestigious posters have 
appeared saying that current financial strictures have made it 
useless to study just as political oppression did during the 
cultural revolution of 196575 
the academics timed their protests to coincide with the national 
peoples congress chinas legislature which today concluded an 
annual 20day session 
although the shoeshiners were quickly escorted by police off the 
square officers allowed the sitin by 19 students and teachers 
more important delegates to the congress acknowledged the 
protesters grievances are real 
xu jialu a delegate and vice president of beijing normal 
university questioned the congress about the policy whereby 
associate professors earn 33 a month is he or she worth so 
little 
shanghai delegates spoke of the devaluation of 
intellectuals and former congress vice chairman zhou gucheng said 
some academics cant even afford to buy dictionaries all this 
should not continue if the country wishes to develop he said 
the response to the protests has been markedly different from 
the conservative backlash that followed much larger prodemocracy 
student demonstrations in december 1986 and january 1987 
at that time students were arrested and hu yaobang the 
communist party head was purged from his post 
since then political activism has died out on campuses with 
students cowed by increased surveillance and threats of poor job 
assignments upon graduation 
the recent protests have avoided trouble because they have 
stayed away from politically sensitive areas they also came at a 
time when some powerful officials are pushing for more money for 
education 
the current government of senior leader deng xiaoping and 
communist party head zhao ziyang has recognized that intellectuals 
are crucial to the nations economic development and has tried to 
raise their social status 
last year millions of teachers and scientists were given 10 
percent pay raises their first in years 
but xu pei a young teacher demonstrating on tiananmen square on 
sunday told canadian television that living conditions for 
teachers remain terribly poor you cant imagine for instance a 
whole family with three or four or five members living in a small 
room about 10 square meters 110 square feet 
xu who said he earns 24 a month considerably less than a 
manual laborer at a profitable factory said he didnt want special 
treatment for teachers 
we only want teachers to get equal pay with other walks of 
society we think we are low we are mistreated 
educators say inadequate state funding for chinas 640000 
undergraduate and 45000 graduate students is seriously undermining 
academic achievment 
the state allocates around 485 a year for an undergraduate and 
1080 to 1620 for research students 
funding for education is to be boosted by 12 percent this year 
but much of that is for the daunting task of improving 
elementarylevel education in rural areas where 200 million people 
20 percent of all chinese remain illiterate 
party chief zhao has told institutes of higher education that 
they will have to fend for themselves saying it is necessary and 
possible for them to earn money by setting up factories and 
providing other services to society 
the state education commission also has proposed the financial 
crunch be eased by having students who now receive basically free 
educations pay their own tuition and be responsible for finding 
their own jobs when they graduate 
by 1993 according to one plan 70 percent of undergraduates 
will be paying tuition or will be sponsored by companies that will 
hire them after their studies are completed 
the reform also designed to motivate students to study more is 
generally accepted as necessary but qualms remain 
students said demonstrator xu now cant see any future 
for them because upon graduation they cant hope to make as much 
money as a worker

the federal aviation administrations 
ambitious modernization of its air traffic control system will cost 
billions of dollars more than the agency estimates because of 
unforeseen technical problems and delays a congressional report 
says 
largely because of unexpected problems in developing and 
installing the new communications radar weather observation and 
computer systems the upgrading will cost at least 24 billion the 
general accounting office told congress tuesday 
the faa which operates the air traffic control system and is 
obtaining the new equipment acknowledges that the program has 
fallen behind schedule but has put the expected cost at 153 
billion 
many of these technologies had to be invented and the faa 
underestimated how long it would take to invent some of these 
things kenneth m mead an associate director of gao told the 
house transportation appropriations subcommittee 
the report by gao congress investigative arm also said 
hundreds of pieces of equipment that are being delivered to faa 
facilities across the country are simply sitting in sheds because 
the agency lacks enough workers to install them 
its like ordering a piano and not having a living room to put 
it in said rep william lehman dfla chairman of the 
subcommittee 
faa administrator allan mcartor said in an interview after the 
hearing that the gao figures were misleading but acknowledged 
that the plan introduced in 1981 is running behind its original 
timetable 
the gao report focused on the national airspace system plan the 
second largest civilian technology project ever undertaken in the 
united states behind only the apollo manned spacecraft program 
federal officials believe the new equipment is necessary to keep 
up with the continuing growth of aviation the fastest growing 
segment of american transportation 
the faa originally hoped the new equipment would be in place by 
1996 but officials now concede that because of delays the project 
will not be completed until at least the year 2000 
the study by gao said that of the 12 major systems that comprise 
the modernization project only one a computer is nearing 
completion major components have been delayed from between one 
year and five years the report said 
reagan administration officials have blamed many of the delays 
on the slowness of federal purchasing procedures and on a refusal 
by congress to provide enough money to buy the equipment 
meanwhile a broad coalition of aviation groups aircraft 
manufacturers and airlines called on not only the industry but air 
travelers to put pressure on the government to expand airspace and 
airport capacity 
the coalition forming a group called partnership for improved 
air travel announced a twoyear campaign to enlist grassroots 
support for spending more money on airports and improvements in the 
air traffic control system 
the air traffic modernization plan must be put on a fast 
track and new airports must be built or air travelers will face 
declining service mounting delays and travel problems in the 
coming years the coalition warned at a news conference 
unless we modernize the air traffic system quickly well 
choke off growth to the detriment of all declared robert 
crandall chairman of american airlines 
crandall was among five airline chief executives and leaders of 
groups representing aircraft manufacturers business flyers 
private and commercial pilots and airport officials who attended a 
news conference announcing the campaign 
the group envisions spending up to 15 million over the next two 
years to publicize the need for more airports and an improved air 
traffic control system 
the nation has not yet made a commitment to create an 
aviation system that can efficiently meet todays demand and 
anticipate tomorrows said herbert kelleher the chairman of 
southwest airlines who also is chairman of the new coalition 
among the complaints voiced by the coalition were too few air 
traffic controllers are being hired and trained federal efforts to 
modernize the air traffic control technology is way behind 
schedule there are too few airports and the federal aviation 
administration needs to be restructured because it is hamstrung by 
bureaucratic restrictions

lawyers for oliver l north and three other 
irancontra criminal defendants say they wont be ready for trial 
until march 1989 after president reagan leaves office 
in the first pretrial hearing in the case the defense teams 
proposed schedule was sharply at odds with that of independent 
counsel lawrence e walsh who said he would be prepared for trial 
this july 
the dispute tuesday left the matter to us district judge 
gerhard a gesell who demanded a tight pretrial schedule but 
warned there may be no case at all unless thousands of government 
documents are declassified and made available to the defense 
the nearly four hours of courtroom arguments were devoted 
entirely to legal questions that were crucial to the case but far 
removed from the web of covert operations and multimilliondollar 
financial transactions detailed in the 23count indictment 
gone was the drama of the march 24 arraignment when former 
national security council staffer north exnational security 
adviser john m poindexter retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord and his business partner albert hakim pleaded innocent to 
the charges 
the masterminds of the secret us arms sales to iran and 
assistance to the nicaraguan contra rebels during congressional 
prohibitions are charged with running those operations as a broad 
criminal conspiracy 
a federal grand jury charged them with defrauding the government 
and then trying to cover up their alleged crimes north secord and 
hakim were accused of personally enriching themselves from the 
irancontra affair 
the next step in the case is an april 25 hearing that will give 
an indication of whether walshs evidence is fully admissible 
all the defendants except secord were given congressional 
immunity to testify before the irancontra committees last summer 
the law prohibits walsh from using the compelled congressional 
testimony of north poindexter and hakim as evidence against them 
gesell who said the hearing would not be the final word on 
tainted evidence invited the defense team to present one 
witness in an effort to prove its contention that much of walshs 
evidence is inadmissible 
barry simon a lawyer for north accepted the challenge 
commenting we think we can draw blood very quickly by 
presenting a grand jury witness who would testify he was influenced 
by immunized testimony 
unless im satisfied steps were taken to avoid taint im 
not going to try this case gesell said 
j herbert stern a former federal judge who is handling the 
question for walsh told gesell the independent counsel would 
likely testify at the hearing on the extensive procedures he 
undertook to avoid reading or listening to the congressional 
testimony 
in addition to the immunity question the judge said a major 
obstacle to a trial is the stack of 300000 classified documents 
that must be submitted to an interagency task force to see if they 
can be declassified and given to the defense 
we cant try a classified documents case it will never 
work the judge said 
walsh estimated that only some 50000 of the documents were 
relevant to the case but gesell said the defense team must have 
access to all the records and make its own decisions 
gesell raised the question of a july trial date walsh said he 
could be ready by then although he said september would be more 
realistic 
without elaboration gesell said he did not want the trial 
underway when the ballots are being counted for the november 
presidential election he also ruled out a trial that would run 
into the christmas vacation because it would be too great a burden 
on jurors who likely would be sequestered 
poindexter lawyer richard w beckler told gesell i dont 
really see a trial actually starting before march of next year 
beckler said numerous defense motions would be filed including 
one to dismiss the case on grounds the defendants were carrying 
out the foreign policy of the president of the united states were 
dealing with a political question rather than a question of 
criminality beckler said 
dont spend a great deal of time on that one gesell said 
when the question of pretrial publicity was raised gesell who 
presided at some of the watergate trials said that experience 
taught him not to worry about the problem because a lot of people 
dont read or pay any attention to the publicity

the decade of the 1970s was the most 
prosperous in the history of rural america but rural areas now 
are losing jobs population and a significant portion of their tax 
bases says an agriculture department economist 
unemployment and other economic troubles hit rural areas broadly 
in the early 1980s as smalltown businesses and industries as well 
as farmers felt the crunch ken deavers of the departments 
economic research service says the rural areas still have not fully 
recovered 
in terms of rural economic development you cant use what you 
did in the 1970s as a model for what youre going to do in the 
1980s he said therefore i think that the rural economic 
adjustment to the new set of realities both domestically and 
internationally is going to be very difficult 
during the 1970s the rural south became the nations 
manufacturing center for textiles apparel wood products and 
shoes in the west mining gas and oil production were thriving 
there was an unprecedented boom in farming and rapid growth in 
the service sector several million people moved from urban areas 
to the countryside and small towns 
but as international markets weakened and as third world 
countries stepped up the competition for lowwage lowskill jobs 
rural manufacturing suffered energy industries slipped into 
recession as a world oil glut sent prices downward 
deavers offered this profile of rural america in the current 
issue of farmline magazine 
the average unemployment rate is more than 9 percent well 
above the national average 
people are moving away in 1986 more than half of all rural 
and smalltown counties declined in population 
the tax base in rural communities is shrinking which means 
that local services such as schools fire departments water 
systems and police all suffer 
rural america is not primarily agricultural and its economic 
future is more tightly linked with national and international 
developments he said in short small towns across rural 
america are fighting problems of unemployment inadequate services 
and financial stress 
many small towns are working hard to develop selfhelp 
revitalization strategies deavers said and they are getting 
results 
an agency documentary aired on many public television stations 
across the country illustrates some of the local efforts the 
onehour video your hometown shows how several rural 
communities have approached economic development deavers also is 
featured in the program 
solving their own problems has got to be the basic strategy 
that rural communities follow deavers said developing 
opportunities that provide solutions to the problems has to come 
from within not from outside the community

agriculture secretary richard e lyng has 
announced a fiveyear plan to improve job opportunities for women 
and minorities at the agriculture department 
lyng said tuesday the plan sets goals to increase the 
employment of minorities and women in occupations and pay grades 
where they are underrepresented compared to the civilian labor 
force 
the plan which covers the fiscal year that began last oct 1 
through 1992 is another step in an initiative lyng announced two 
years ago to begin correcting inequities in usda employment 
practices 
at that time the us equal employment opportunity commission 
ranked usda 52nd in a field of 58 federal agencies in the 
employment of minorities 
since 1985 total usda employment has been reduced by nearly 
6500 permanent positions lyng said but the percentage of 
minorities in the departments current workforce of 90000 
permanent employees increased to 146 percent from 13 percent 
the number of women at usda increased to 35 percent from 329 
percent in 1985 he said 
it has been a long time coming but the fact that we have 
produced this departmentwide plan for affirmative employment makes 
it clear that the department of agriculture is totally committed to 
equal opportunity in every facet of its operation lyng said 
the plan was prepared by the departments office of advocacy and 
enterprise and the office of personnel it establishes specific 
hiring and promotion goals for each occupation and minority based 
on an analysis of current usda employment 
further the plan sets management guidelines and objectives for 
minority recruitment hiring and promotion employee development 
programs program monitoring and evaluation preventing sexual 
harassment and handling discrimination complaints 
according to the plan usda women exceed the governmentwide 
average in administrative occupations but trail badly in 
professional and technical positions 
in the technical jobs women work primarily at indoor 
occupations rather than fieldgoing jobs perpetuating the idea 
that women cannot or will not perform outside strenuous or dirty 
work the report said 
also it said 74 percent of all female employees are currently 
in pay grades gs8 and below compared with 26 percent of all male 
employees in those lower grades

a marine sentry was killed at an 
american military facility and us officials said he apparently 
was caught in crossfire between fellow guards on a night search for 
intruders 
a pentagon spokesman in washington said the identity of the 
intruders was not known but members of the panamanian defense 
forces are thought to have slipped into the facility before 
a spokesman for the us southern command in panama said there 
was no reason at all at this time to suspect that the 
panamanian military was involved in mondays shooting he said it 
appeared to be an accident 
the disaster was the second to befall us troops in panama on 
monday earlier two helicopters collided on a runway at another 
base about 50 miles away injuring eight soldiers 
the pentagon spokesman dan howard said there have been a 
series of intrusions at howard air force base in the past several 
weeks by individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged 
when one has intruders into the base perimeter who are in 
uniform and are camouflaged the assumption that one comes to is 
that of course they are members of the panamanian defense forces 
howard said 
however martin alberto paz a spokesman for the panamanian 
military said the defense forces had absolutely nothing to do 
this shooting and another official accused the united states of 
trying to create an incident 
this insinuation tries to implicate the panama defense forces 
in an incident in which only united states soldiers participated 
maj daniel delgado diamante told a news conference tuesday evening 
and lt cmdr doug schamp a us navy spokesman attached to the 
southern command said we have absolutely no indication the 
defense forces were involved in the shooting 
the defense forces are under the control of panamanian strongman 
gen manuel antonio noriega who has been indicted by a us 
federal court on drug trafficking charges the reagan 
administration has used diplomatic and economic pressure to try to 
drive noriega from power 
pentagon and us southern command officials said the marine 
apparently was shot by fellow guards while investigating a breakin 
at howard air force base on the other side of the panama canal 
from panama city 
the dead man was identified as cpl ricardo m villahermosa 25 
of santurce puerto rico a member of i company 3rd battalion 4th 
marine regiment of camp lejeune nc 
villahermosa was one of nearly 2000 marines and army personnel 
dispatched to panama in the past few weeks to increase security for 
the canal other us installations and american citizens 
us air force col ron sconyers of the southern command said 
villahermosa was part of a 12man marine patrol at the arriajan 
tank farm a fuel storage area near the air base 
he said the marine suffered massive internal bleeding from a 
single bullet 
the southern command and the pentagon issued identical 
statements saying the shooting occurred after an apparent 
intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area 
us security forces patrolling the area had split up and were 
in the process of rejoining when a trip flare was set off sounding 
like gunfire the statement said 
in response the two elements of the patrol fired seven 
rounds were discharged before the onthescene commander ordered a 
ceasefire initial indications are that the fatal gunshot wound 
was not the result of hostile gunfire but rather the result of a 
crossfire from the us shots fired 
in the helicopter accident eight soldiers were injured slightly 
when two uh60 helicopters collided at fort sherman about 50 miles 
north of the capital they were not immediately identified 
the southern command said they were permanently assigned to fort 
kobbe near panama city one of 10 us military installations along 
the canal

booked for murder whereupon he broke down and cried like the big 
coward that he really is police chief daryl gates said

congress bears a responsibility to see that 
children dependent on high technology machines to stay alive 
receive the care they need at home when possible says a federal 
task force 
the report issued tuesday makes no estimate of what such an 
approach would cost and acknowledges that bringing about the 
resolution it recommends will depend on generating public pressure 
for changes 
advocates must give special emphasis to raising public 
awareness of these children and the special issues affecting their 
care said the report by the task force on technology dependent 
children 
rep thomas j tauke riowa who was among those pushing for 
creation of the task force 18 months ago acknowledged to the head 
of the panel at a news conference that you have thrown a good 
portion of the challenge back to congress 
i will try to make sure these recommendations do not die on 
the vine tauke said at a news conference this report is going 
to put additional pressure on congress to respond to the need 
at the same time tauke said there is little likelihood of 
action this year with congress aiming for adjournment in advance of 
the november elections 
the task force said congress should 
develop and implement legislative strategies for ensuring 
access to programs that meet the individual needs of 
technologydependent children 
develop legislative strategies requiring all public and 
private payers that finance health care for technologydependent 
children to develop appropriate measures for ending 
institutional bias within these programs 
creation of the task force stemmed partly from the katie beckett 
case in 1981 medicaid rules in effect at the time kept her from 
being cared for at home at a cost of about 2000 a month but it 
was costing about 12000 a month to keep her in a hospital 
when the case came to president reagans attention he told 
aides in a widely publicized episode to find a way to cut through 
the red tape 
tauke said katie now 10 lives at home attends school and 
sings in her church choir 
for every katie thriving at home we still have many children 
in hospital wards tauke added 
administrative changes made since 1981 allow states more leeway 
in deciding how to spend medicaid dollars on such children who are 
dependent on machines to help them breathe as katie was or 
maintain other life sustaining functions 
estimates of the number of children who require such care range 
from 2300 to 17000 depending on the level of technology needed 
but the report says fewer than 400 are being cared for at home 
under the medicaid waivers now allowed 
the task force defined a technologydependent child as one 
requiring use of a specific medical device to compensate for loss 
of a lifesustaining function and one who requires daily ongoing 
care or monitoring by trained personnel 
were not talking about hearing aides or crutches said dr 
robert g kettrick the task force chairman who emphasized that 
drawing such a specific definition for the first time was in itself 
a significant step 
also for the first time it defines appropriate care as 
whatever is required to maintain life support and provide an 
environment conducive to growth and development it spells out 
that such a treatment plan is to be documented and managed 
through the use of an individualized plan developed and monitored 
by a team which includes parents or guardians

are found innocent in the irancontra affair but will keep his own 
counsel on the subject of a pardon if theyre not 
bush also conceded ive taken a lot of shots from democrats 
for refusing to reveal private advice he had given president reagan 
on the subject of arms sales to iran 
but it doesnt bother me because im doing whats right he 
said tuesday 
the vice president was asked whether he would pardon poindexter 
and north if elected 
i hope my own personal hope is theyre found innocent of any 
wrongdoing bush said 
all but assured of the republican presidential nomination bush 
campaigned in new york saying he doesnt see much difference among 
the three democratic contenders 
bush called the democratic contest heating up here in advance 
of the crucial new york primary next tuesday a bloodletting 
he accused all three democrats of seeking to set the clock back 
to the malaise days that he said marked former president jimmy 
carters term 
bush planned to visit a public school in east harlem today 
before campaign stops in buffalo and rochester 
at the school stop bush was expected to stress a favorite 
campaign theme a greater emphasis on education 
he was also making a bid for minority votes asked on tuesday if 
jesse jacksons candidacy would make it difficult for republicans 
to attract black votes bush conceded it probably would telling 
reporters in syracuse theres sort of a race pride there that i 
understand 
but he added i think my message of hope and opportunity 
more employment a better shot through education offers more hope 
than some of those ageold democratic answers that have failed 
bush threw out the first ball at a mets game at shea stadium on 
tuesday then attended a 1000aplate evening fundraiser 
sponsored by new york developer donald trump 
even though he has a lock on the gop nomination bush has 
indicated he plans to campaign throughout the remaining primary 
season particularly in voterich states like new york 
weve got to get into these states and command a presence 
said bush aide peter teeley 
bush in a session with new york broadcast reporters said any 
discussion of pardoning poindexter and north was too 
hypothetical a pardon imputes guilt and the american system after 
all is innocentuntilprovenguilty 
im not going to get into that he added if i had to face 
that at some time then ill keep my own counsel and make my own 
decision 
bush also said he strongly opposes creation of a palestinian 
state a subject that has become a major issue on the democratic 
side 
jesse jackson has said he favors a palestinian homeland 
tennessee sen albert gore jr has also accused massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis of harboring similar sympathies which dukakis 
denies 
there shouldnt be a palestinian state bush said its 
not good foreign policy solving the palestinian problem is 
on another subject bush told reporters that he did not think he 
was too aristoratic to build wide support 
if so why would i have cleaned them republican rivals up in 
the primaries he asked 
for you to suggest that some aristocratic bias makes it 
impossible for me to reach out just you watch bush declared

more companies are lining up behind 
environmental groups by promising to stop using a chemical compound 
that threatens the earths ozone layer 
the latest move away from chlorofluorocarbon or cfc compounds 
comes from the 15 or so companies who use them to make plastic foam 
food packages things like egg cartons 
theyll be using substitute compounds by the end of the year 
their trade association the foodservice amp packaging institute 
announced tuesday that will make it the first industry to give up 
cfcs completely 
consumers should notice little change since foam packages will 
still be on the shelves 
the announcement came after consultations with three major 
environmental groups the natural resources defense council the 
environmental defense fund and friends of the earth friends of the 
earth already had persuaded some fastfood chains to stop using 
cfcmade foam clamshell hamburger warmers and some cities have 
banned these products 
all three praised the industry and were joined by the 
environmental protection agency epa chief lee m thomas said in a 
statement the action was a welcome contribution to the protection 
of the earths ozone layer 
cfcs break down the ozone layer which protects the earth from 
the suns ultraviolet rays 
the institutes announcement was the third in washington since 
december on ending commercial use of cfc compounds 
in december the atampt corp said it was switching its solvents 
for cleaning computer chips from one of the cfcs 
last month the du pont co the largest producer of cfcs said 
it would work toward a total phaseout of cfc manufacture but set 
no deadline 
the institutes program said joseph goffman attorney for the 
environmental defense fund surpasses in three important respects 
the phaseout program announced by du pont it has a deadline 
provides for public reporting by the institute on cfc use and 
establishes a cooperative program with the environmental groups to 
encourage the search for an entirely benign substitute he said 
about a third of current foam packaging for food is made with 
cfcs and most of that is expected to be switched to a related 
compound called hcfc22 approved last december by the food and 
drug administration the institute committed itself to switch to a 
benign compound if it can be developed within a year of approval 
by the fda 
hcfc22 still has some potential to destroy the highaltitude 
ozone layer but epa estimates it is only about 5 percent as 
powerful as the compounds being given up 
the compounds used as blowing agents in making food packaging 
foams account for 15 percent to 2 percent of the united states 
total cfc use and geoffrey webb of friends of the earth conceded 
clearly this is not the bulk of ozone depletion 
but webb said its clearly an unnecessary use and the 
symbolism of the switch is important to the environmentalists 
david doniger attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said it is our intention to go to other sectors of the 
economy and say these guys did it so can you 
the cfcs used in blowing agents are gasses that escape to the 
atmosphere and rise over a decade to the ozone layer 15 miles to 25 
miles high 
epa figures each percent decline in the ozone layer means an 
increase in of 48 percent to 75 percent in the most common skin 
cancer for this and other reasons major nations agreed last year 
to cut cfc production by 50 percent by 1998

the woman who was raped and mutilated 
by lawrence singleton says his impending release and reports that 
he is seeking court action against her have prompted her to renew 
her court battle with him 
mary vincent left for dead after singleton raped her and hacked 
off her forearms said tuesday she has instructed her lawyer to 
serve singleton with a 24 million judgment she won against him 
last year in nevada 
before todays news i was almost ready to live and let 
live and go on with my life that is no longer possible vincent 
said tuesday 
singleton was convicted of the rapemutilation in 1978 and was 
sentenced to a 14year fourmonth term he is due for release from 
san quentin state prison on may 25 
vincents statement read by a spokesman for her lawyer came 
after a newspaper reported monday that singleton was seeking an 
investigation into his claim that she kidnapped him at knifepoint 
while hitchhiking 
singleton was paroled last year for good behavior and work 
credits but for the past 10 months has been living in a mobile 
home on the san quentin prison grounds after residents of several 
northern california communities fought plans to place him in their 
towns 
singleton who maintained that other hitchhikers were 
responsible for the attack on vincent also told the daily ledger 
of antioch that he may spend his first days of freedom with a 
church group in oregon 
vincent whose attorney says only that she resides in the 
pacific northwest was reported last year to be living in southern 
oregon 
the pastor of a church in azalea ore said tuesday that 
singleton would be welcome to live with church members after he 
regains his freedom 
wed be liars if we denied him a home now tom smith jr 
told the newsreview of roseburg ore he would have to agree to 
living our lifestyle which is caring more for your brother than 
yourself and not everybody is willing to do that 
smith said he hasnt been in touch with singleton though he had 
tried to reach him through the parole division in california 
when singleton was due to be paroled smith offered him a job as 
a handyman with the bride of christ church but oregon officials 
denied permission for singleton to move to the state

nearly one dollar in every four the world bank 
lends to third world governments is given on condition that they 
change their policies following the urging of the united states 
its not a new kind of lending but the report released this 
week reflects the importance the united states and other wealthy 
countries now give to influencing governments of poorer nations 
in 1979 the proportion of this kind of loan was less than one 
dollar in 300 the rest of the banks money was used as now for 
the traditional kinds of world bank loans building schools roads 
and hospitals dredging harbors and helping farmers without regard 
to how the government is run 
the bank the biggest source of aid for poor countries 
authorized more than 175 billion in loans in the year that ended 
last june 30 compared with 10 billion in 1979 in 1979 
policybased lending amounted to only 31 million compared with 
almost 35 billion in 1987 
the new proportions appeared in a special report issued as part 
of this weeks semiannual meetings of the bank and its sister 
organization the international monetary fund they are owned by 
the same 151 countries with the united states as the largest 
single contributor to both 
at a 1985 meeting in seoul south korea treasury secretary 
james a baker iii said the bank should take the lead in 
policybased lending the bank had already been making such loans 
on a smaller scale but bakers speech and the advent of a new bank 
president barber conable gave the process a push 
its called conditionality and the international monetary 
fund has been using it on almost all loans for years the imf 
however does not claim to be a development agency its job is to 
keep currencies stable and it rarely lends money for more than 
three years 
the banks mission is to raise living standards over the long 
term and it has lent for periods as long as 50 years 
bakers idea was for the bank to help work out longterm plans 
country by country that would adjust a governments policies 
and put the country in better position to handle its debts since 
then third world debt has risen from 738 billion to more than 
11 trillion the bank estimates 
the banks report measures the success of its adjustment 
programs by a countrys growth although it says there is no simple 
cause and effect and the effects can take a long time in coming 
it surveyed 16 countries which had such programs between 1980 
and 1984 before baker made his proposal it said eight of them 
increased the average citizens income south korea pakistan 
turkey thailand costa rica ghana mauritius and morocco only in 
the philippines and the ivory coast were there declines 
these programs have already produced solid achievements the 
report says 
further success will depend not only on the continued 
willingness of borrowers to undertake difficult adjustment but on 
sufficient external finance 
that was a reference to the banks effort to get a big increase 
in its capital so that it can increase its lending member 
governments including the reagan administration have approved the 
increase but there have been threats of trouble in congress because 
the united states is still behind with its payments on an earlier 
capital increase

a man who spent six years behind bars 
for a robbery he didnt commit credits his release from prison to 
the determination of a retired policeman who dug up the evidence 
proving his innocence 
he knew i wasnt guilty he knew i didnt do it charles 
blake said tuesday of the man who came to his aid robert seymour 
i just got caught in the system and it took me along 
blake 43 was freed last week from state prison after norfolk 
superior court judge john d sheehan listened to a tape recording 
of another convict confessing to the armed robbery blake was first 
jailed for in 1971 
blake was returned to prison in 1985 after being at large for 11 
years following an escape 
the judge reduced the one to fiveyear sentence he had given 
blake for his escape saying he had served enough time the 
sentence was the only one remaining since another judge reduced 
blakes original 10 to 15year robbery sentence last fall after 
hearing similar evidence 
i tell you those court officers would have yelled yea if 
they were allowed to said blakes cousin yvonne barklow 
among blakes supporters hugging and shaking hands in the 
courtroom was his former wife delores who had returned from 
california with their two children last may to work on his defense 
they plan to remarry next month 
but the focus of attention was seymour a 20year veteran of the 
springfield police force 
ive never had a case in which a police officer has gone to 
such lengths to try to show a man was unfairly convicted 
thompson said 
the selfeffacing seymour said only that kid spent a lot of 
time in jail for something he didnt do i feel rotten about it 
blake said he will treat seymour to dinner as soon as the former 
policeman has a free night from his parttime job as a security 
officer at holyoke community college he was the main ingredient 
in this blake said 
seymour said an informant called him the night of blakes 
conviction to tell him the government had the wrong man blake had 
been found guilty of one of two armed robberies in the springfield 
area both committed by a man wearing a full afro hair style 
the following year james d kelly was convicted of the other 
armed robbery and given a 12 to 18year sentence 
seymour then a sergeant conducting drug investigations 
believed blake might have been mistaken for kelly because of his 
afro although he was not assigned to the case seymour went to the 
prosecutor with surveillance photos and mug shots showing the 
similarities between the men the prosecutor said he saw no 
resemblance 
blake escaped while on furlough in 1974 and worked as a roofer 
for the next 11 years until his arrest in washington dc 
seymour meanwhile kept in touch with blakes family through 
the episcopal church they both attended and often visited them to 
keep their spirits up 
all the support i had was robert seymour said blakes 
cousin ms barklow 
in 1986 two years after his retirement seymour visited kelly 
in jail kelly confessed the robbery in writing and on tape 
seymour said although he later refused to testify at any hearings 
blake says hes planning to move to california resume work as a 
roofer and try to put the years in jail behind him 
im just glad to be free he said maybe i might be 
resentful later on

bouzbid 
the aps news agency said negotiations started at 450 am 
1150 pm edt tuesday algerian government sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity specified that negotiations were direct 
not by radio 
activity continued around the kuwait airways aircraft but 
nothing could be clearly distinguished from a distance reporters 
were being kept in the terminal area 400 yards from the aircraft 
the boeing 747 left larnaca cyprus after the gunmen freed 12 
more passengers in what they called a gesture of goodwill the 
hijackers have killed two passengers during the grim nineday 
odyssey

hotel overlooking the city center in the event they were needed 
to take in hostages 
earlier in cyprus akis fantis a government spokesman told 
reporters sources in algiers gave assurances that the gunmen 
would give up the hostages and the plane in algeria but one of the 
hijackers denied it

has been reported by radios and by the media that we are ready to 
hand the plane to anyone we refuse to do that until martyrdom 
he did not mention hostages 
on tuesday in larnaca the gunmen said they had donned death

reagan administration officials are bargaining 
with lawmakers over what kind of trade bill the president would be 
willing to sign but neither side appeared to be yielding ground 
we had a good healthy discussion us trade representative 
clayton k yeutter said tuesday after a 30minute session with 
three key senators that the participants acknowledged was 
inconclusive 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas merely 
said the meeting confirmed some of the things that i had 
thought but indicated he had not gone into the session expecting 
a quick deal 
also on hand for the session in bentsens office were treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and sens bob packwood rore and 
john c danforth rmo the idea was to find out what items must be 
dropped from the 1000page trade bill moving in congress to 
guarantee that president reagan would sign rather than veto it 
confusion surrounds the bill because most of it has been 
approved under a complex system set up by a conference committee to 
resolve differences between house and senate versions farm 
lawmakers have been unable to finish their work and another panel 
has yet to act on provisions requiring disclosure of foreign 
holdings in this country 
the reagan administration opposes some of the provisions that 
did get approval 
one is a requirement that major employers give notice of plant 
closings and largescale layoffs another is trade sanctions 
against japans toshiba corp for the sale to the soviet union of 
equipment that lets submarines run quietly 
lawmakers say they think reagan would sign the central 
provisions of the measure that streamline machinery for retaliation 
against trade violations including transfer of authority to order 
such action from the president to the us trade representative 
but the possibility remains that lawmakers who had tried to 
have a final product before their spring break last week will 
decide to go back to the drawing board for one last effort to get 
the measure into shape 
hours before the meeting house speaker jim wright warned 
lawmakers against watering down the bill by dropping its most 
stringent provisions in an effort to prevent a presidential veto 
it is not really prudent for the white house to try to get the 
last pound of flesh wright told reporters 
wright said the administrations persistent opposition to 
several elements of the trade bill creates doubt as to whether it 
really understands even yet the seriousness of americas 
competitiveness problems 
what does the white house really want wright said surely 
it shouldnt want to lobotomize the trade bill as the price for the 
presidents signature its spokesmen seem repelled by those 
provisions which are bold enough creative enough and potent enough 
to deal with our persistent and growing superdeficit in trade so 
inappropriate for a superpower 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday there had 
been notable progress on the trade bill but improvements must 
be made 
the administration is prepared to continue working with the 
congressional leaders and the full conference on an acceptable 
bill fitzwaters statement said 
but let there be no misunderstanding the president will not 
hestitate to veto a trade bill that will hurt americas economic 
prosperity it added

senators debating the 11 trillion federal 
budget for fiscal 1989 with few disputes over its details are 
questioning whether the spending plan accurately portrays the 
governments deficit 
the lawmakers hoped to complete work today on a budget blueprint 
in which the key questions about taxes and domestic defense and 
foreign assistance spending have already been settled 
during tuesdays second day of debate over the proposal some 
senators examined its projected 136 billion deficit and pronounced 
the budget misleading 
the 136 billion figure is crucial because that is the 1989 
deficit target set by the grammrudman balanced budget law should 
the deficit exceed that figure by 10 billion spending would 
automatically be cut across the board to the target level 
the problem said legislators was that the figure includes 
surpluses being stashed away by several government programs such 
as social security in which money is set aside for specific 
purposes 
the legislators argued that since those funds can be spent for 
nothing else it is deceptive to use them to reduce the 
governments red ink 
there is nothing less to call this but fraud said sen 
ernest hollings dsc 
in an 858 vote tuesday the senate gave preliminary approval to 
a nonbinding amendment urging lawmakers to discount the special 
highway and aviation funds when determining the size of the 
deficit those programs are expected to garner a 2 billion surplus 
in fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the budget committee 
has introduced another provision aimed at persuading senators not 
to count social security when computing the deficit 
social security which is accumulating money for the retirement 
of the baby boom generation in the early 21st century is expected 
to run a 46 billion surplus next year 
the budget itself contains little that is controversial largely 
because last falls summit agreement between president reagan and 
congressional leaders answered most of the questions that have 
sparked months of bitter debate in the past 
as a result congress work on the budget resolution is expected 
to be completed earlier than it has in years 
the senates spending plan calls for 294 billion in military 
spending 161 billion for foreign assistance and 1692 billion 
for domestic programs set by automatic formulas 
it also includes 14 billion in new taxes called for by the 
summit agreement and already enacted 
the major differences between the senate proposal and the 
version reagan sent congress in february are over domestic 
priorities the lawmakers would provide money for several 
development and transportation programs that the president sought 
to eliminate or slash severely 
the senators would increase space and science spending by about 
onefourth and also dramatically increase money for aids research 
education and drug enforcement 
their budget would also increase military salaries by 43 
percent and pay for civilian workers by 2 percent spend 500 
million for more farm commodities for the poor permit expansion of 
the medicaid health program and enactment of medicare catastrophic 
illness insurance and cut rural housing assistance elderly 
housing and community and regional development 
the house approved a similar version of the budget last month 
congress two chambers must ultimately approve identical budget 
resolutions but the presidents signature is not required

major issues in a sixway race won by jean grace who was endorsed 
by the 57yearold eastwood 
palm springs officials said their 55 percent turnout while 
higher than the average 30 percent to 40 percent would not be a 
record 
there are about 18000 registered voters in this city of 38000 
and usually 6000 turn out on election day said mayor frank 
bogert 76 who is retiring after serving two twoyear terms 
bono 53 rose to fame as the furryvested bellbottomed former 
hippie singing ive got you babe with cher who he correctly 
had predicted would win the best actress oscar on monday 
the new mayor will serve four years instead of two and be paid 
15000 a year

which has lost much of its glamour and tourist business to such 
neighboring desert communities as palm desert where jim and tammy 
bakker are living and rancho mirage where bob hope frank sinatra 
and gerald ford live 
bono has been at the forefront of the revitalization movement 
planning a celebrityfilled film festival concerts and a sporting 
event such as a marathon or triathalon to attract tourists and 
money if he is elected 
bono has said he began coming to palm springs 110 miles east of 
los angeles 14 years ago to escape the bigcity craziness of los 
angeles he moved here four years ago and opened an italian 
restaurant called bono 
after runins with city officials over the size of his 
restaurant sign and a retaining wall at the 1920s estate he is 
refurbishing he decided to run for mayor 
if they can do that to me just imagine how the ordinary 
person is treated who wants to start a business he said last 
week referring to unnamed city officials were trying to 
encourage business here not chase it away i have a big investment 
in this city i dont want to see it deteriorate or decline 
bono still dabbles in entertainment appearing with cher during

the rev charles curran says his battle with 
catholic university may be nearly resolved even though the 
universitys board of trustees stripped him of his authority to 
teach theology in the name of the vatican 
although they revoked the suspended theologians canonical 
mission the trustees tuesday allowed him to remain as a tenured 
professor and conceded curran can teach at the university in 
programs other than those requiring vatican sanction 
this action does not remove father currans tenure with the 
university the university said in a statement it does bar him 
from teaching in the universitys department of theology 
curran has dissented from church doctrine on a range of sexual 
issues expressing the view that contraception and sterilization 
are not intrinsically evil and that the church should allow 
divorce in certain circumstances he also said that for a 
genuine homosexual homosexual acts in the context of a loving 
relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be 
objectively and morally acceptable 
the trustees directed top board members to talk with curran 
about an alternative teaching assignment within an area of his 
professional competence 
that would leave him able to teach at catholic but outside of 
the department of theology where the internationally known 
theologian has taught for 22 years 
the action sets up a possible end to a controversy that has 
pitted the conservative church hierarchy against liberal catholics 
in the united states 
it comes a week after a judge rejected the universitys request 
to dismiss a suit by curran seeking his reinstatement 
curran has claimed in the lawsuit that he should be allowed to 
teach classes that do not require the canonical mission a form of 
license to teach programs accredited by the vatican 
the boards action appears to acknowledge that such a 
resolution may now be acceptable curran said in a statement 
released tuesday by his lawyers 
if that proves to be correct then we should be able to move 
quickly to put this matter behind us and get on with our work he 
said 
currans attorney john hunt said curran would only accept a 
teaching assignment that is for real his area of competence is 
moral theology 
curran has been suspended from teaching at catholic since 
january 1987 when washington dc archbishop james a hickey 
chancellor of the school acted on a vatican ruling that currans 
views on sexual issues left him neither suitable nor eligible to 
teach catholic theology 
curran is now a visiting professor at cornell university

robert carlyle byrd once described himself as 
a perfectionist who falls far short of perfection 
but this onetime meatcutter selfeducated fiddler and student 
of shakespeare used a lifetime of hard work attention to detail 
and an ability to change with the times to rise from the coalfields 
of west virginia to become a force in the united states senate 
he announced tuesday he would give up the post of senate 
majority leader at years end after seeking reelection to a sixth 
term as senator from west virginia characteristically he first 
informed his fellow democratic senators and his home state by a 
satellite hookup to institute wva before going public 
byrd had two homes west virginia and the united states senate 
he used the bible and the senate rule book to make his mark in 
both 
byrd led senate democrats for 10 years he was elected majority 
leader after the 1976 elections and served until 1980 when ronald 
reagan became president and republicans took control of the senate 
six years later when democrats returned to power in the senate 
byrd regained the post after brushing aside a challenge by sen 
lawton chiles of florida 
until tuesday byrd had kept constituents and fellow democratic 
senators in the dark about his future plans 
when he made his announcement at a party luncheon tuesday 
afternoon one senator who had left the room abruptly returned when 
told by reporters what byrd planned to say after dessert 
even speaker of the house jim wright of texas learned of byrds 
decision from a reporter 
byrds rise in the senate he unseated sen edward m kennedy 
as party whip in 1971 for his first major leadership post was 
almost as dramatic as his rise from childhood deprivation 
byrd was born cornelius calvin sale jr in north wilkesboro 
nc his mother died at age 10 his father abandoned him and he was 
sent to the coalfields to live with an aunt and uncle vlurma and 
titus byrd 
growing up in crab orchard wva byrd worked as a gas station 
attendant butcher store clerk and welder he learned enough to 
graduate first in his high school class and he learned to play the 
fiddle 
his fiddling earned him an honorary membership in the country 
music association his reading and continuing drive for education 
earned him a law degree in 1963 at age 45 and after he had been a 
senator for four years 
when he first ran for the us house of representatives in 1952 
a past brief membership in the ku klux klan was revealed and byrd 
was urged to drop out of the race 
instead he went on radio and explained that being only 24 at 
the time i joined the order because it offered excitement and 
because it was strongly opposed to communism after about a year i 
became disinterested quit paying my dues and dropped my 
membership 
that same year he gave up drinking he remains a teetotaler 
byrd started out a conservative on social issues voting against 
the civil rights act of 1964 and against the nomination of thurgood 
marshall to the supreme court 
but his move up the senate ladder moderated his positions when 
he voted against a supreme court nominee last year it was the 
conservative robert bork and when the civil rights restoration act 
was enacted over a presidential veto this year byrd was a strong 
supporter 
for all that he has remained an individual priding himself in 
his vast knowledge of senate rules his ability to recite poetry at 
length on the senate floor his ongoing rereading of the bible of 
the works of shakespeare and even the dictionary page by page 
word by word

robert byrds decision to step down from 
the us senates top post and become chairman of the powerful 
appropriations committee was welcomed by political figures in his 
economically struggling state 
byrds job as majority leader gave him enormous power to direct 
the flow of legislation in the capitol but at home where he is 
running for his sixth sixyear term his clout in washington has 
been overshadowed by criticism that he has done little for west 
virginia a state mired in poverty and financial troubles 
west virginia is hurting byrd said tuesday the recession 
that began in 1981 dealt a crippling blow to west virginia the 
economic recovery that other regions have enjoyed has for the most 
part bypassed our state 
the state in december reclaimed the national lead in 
unemployment when it surpassed louisiana with an 114 percent 
jobless rate joblessness swelled to 132 percent in february the 
latest federal statistics available one recent study found that 
slightly less than onefourth of children in west virginia living 
in poverty 
the state also has long ranked low on the list of recipients of 
federal aid once transfer payments to individuals such as food 
stamps and social security are excluded byrd said he hopes to do 
something about that as chairman of the appropriations panel 
byrd said he cannot work miracles but he will have a new 
opportunity to have a more direct influence on the allocation of 
our nations scarce fiscal resources 
several state political leaders had urged byrd this week to 
choose the appropriations chairmanship saying he could do more for 
the state there 
as majority leader you are being a choir director for a whole 
bunch of people which minimizes the time and dilutes the 
opportunities you have for your own agenda for your own state or 
district said huntington mayor bobby nelson a former state 
senator who once served as a capitol hill aide 
id tell him to take the appropriations chairmanship he can 
keep up better with the state and still have a powerful impact over 
his colleagues 
republican gov arch moore a longtime political foe was one of 
few west virginia politicians to criticize byrds decision 
i would be hardpressed to suggest that west virginians will 
notice any difference as a result of the change he said in a 
statement 
byrds seniority gives him first option on the chairmanship 
which is being vacated by retiring sen john stennis dmiss 
tradition would prevent byrd from serving as party leader and 
appropriations committee chairman 
after serving in the state legislature byrd was elected to the 
house of representatives three times beginning in 1952 in 1958 he 
was elected to the senate he became majority whip in 1971 and 
majority leader in 1977 
he faces bobbie myers a huntington moving company executive in 
west virginias may 10 primary election the winner will face state 
sen jay wolfe or buckhannon resident bernie lumbert both 
republicans in the general election

about the subject yet 
still the vice president has told reporters that suggestions 
keep coming to him over the transom under the door in plain 
manilla envelopes 
at least once this stock answer came out plain vanilla 
envelopes and more recently the suggestions have come to him in 
plain brown evelopes 
one unsolicited recommendation came from former president 
richard nixon who suggested on nbcs meet the press show last 
sunday that bush should team up with his defeated rival kansas 
sen bob dole 
bush said the proposal was interesting and noted it 
wasnt over the transom or under the door it was on channel 
four that was a reference to the nbc station that airs meet the 
press in washington 
it may have been in mock response to nixons comments that 
democrat michael dukakis was a word processor and jesse jackson a 
poet 
during his current campaign swing through new york state bush 
was asked by reporters in syracuse whether there was a dole in 
your future a reference that included both the senate minority 
leader and his wife former transportation secretary elizabeth dole 
could be responded the vice president i have great 
respect for elizabeth bob tells me she really wants to help

a guyanese immigrant convicted of killing his 
girlfriend and four members of her family including a 4yearold 
girl in a jealous rage was executed early wednesday in louisianas 
electric chair 
leslie lowenfield 34 professed his innocence as he was led 
into the death chamber 
the one who did this is still out there he said in a final 
statement 
moments earlier the us supreme court refused to put off the 
execution 
lowenfield was pronounced dead at 1225 am said roger thomas 
an assistant warden at the louisiana state penitentiary 
it was louisianas second execution this year and the nations 
fourth 
lowenfields attorneys argued that he was mentally ill and 
therefore unable to understand the death penalty they took their 
final plea to the high court after the 5th us circuit court of 
appeals us district judge peter beer and the louisiana supreme 
court all turned down appeals tuesday 
five of the nine us supreme court justices opposed delaying 
the execution justice william brennan wrote a dissent joined by 
thurgood marshall harry blackmun and john paul stevens issued a 
separate statement indicating they would have granted the requested 
stay spokeswoman kathy arberg said in washington dc 
warden hilton butler said lowenfield kept hoping until the end 
for a fifth delay of as many execution dates 
butler said lowenfield spurned the condemneds customary last 
meal and spent the evening with dale brown the head basketball 
coach from louisiana state university 
brown widely recognized as a motivational speaker had been 
corresponding with lowenfield since he took the lsu team on a tour 
of angolas death row in 1984 butler said 
a catholic priest and nun also were with lowenfield the warden 
said 
lowenfield a welder from guyana who came to the united states 
in 1981 on a work permit was convicted in 1984 in the august 1982 
slayings of his estranged girlfriend who was a jefferson parish 
sheriffs deputy and four others 
the case has alrady been appealed unsuccessfully to both the 
states highest court and the us supreme court lawyers based 
their latest appeal on a recent psychological study that found the 
prisoner to be a paranoid schizophrenic 
there is a serious question about leslies competency to be 
executed due to his mental illness said judith menadue attorney 
for the louisiana capital defense project 
she said the us supreme court has ruled that people who cannot 
understand what it means to be executed may not be put to death 
before the trial lowenfield was found competent and he refused 
to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense insisting 
instead that he was in florida at the time the family was killed 
but no witnesses backed up his story of being out of state 
the denial of the stay was issued without further comment from 
the state supreme court majority but the one member who backed the 
appeal issued a brief dissent 
the clinical psychologist who spent five hours with the 
defendant concluded lowenfield indicated that he is currently 
unable to understand the death penalty justice john a dixon 
wrote 
he noted that criminal law calls for halting prosecution when 
there are reasonable grounds to doubt a defendants sanity and for 
going ahead after that only when the defendant is found to have the 
mental capacity to do so 
prosecutors said lowenfield barged into his girlfriends house 
in marrero a new orleans suburb and shot everybody there 
the victims were the girlfriend sheila thomas 27 her 
daughter shantel osborne 4 her stepfather owen griffin 45 her 
mother myrtle griffin 44 and the little girls father carl 
osborne 33 
the prosecution said lowenfield was jealous of miss thomas they 
said the couple had lived together in a stormy relationship until 
earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the house on fire and she 
moved out 
investigators found a notebook full of obscenities and threats 
in one place he wrote she have to go to the wormes she took all 
i work for then leave to go and be with carl but i just cannot take 
it eany more 
lowenfield was arrested two months later in new york 
parts of the evidence against him were letters he wrote miss 
thomas relatives while he was jailed in new york one said osborne 
had grabbed the child as a shield and lowenfield had shot both of 
them 
on trial lowenfield insisted on an alibi defense saying he was 
in jacksonville fla looking for work at the time of the murders 
after a separate trial to determine the penalty jurors came 
back three times saying they could not decide whether he should 
die prodded on by the judge they decided on the fourth try to 
condemn him to death

two industrialists who have been members of 
president reagans kitchen cabinet and other wealthy 
businessmen paid at least 156000 each to buy the california home 
the reagans will occupy when they leave the white house 
a washington law firm disclosed the information tuesday by 
releasing an exchange of letters with the office of government 
ethics in july 1986 
businessmen holmes tuttle and earle jorgensen are among the 20 
or so people who helped buy the home the newly released documents 
show when paired with articles of incorporation on file with the 
state in sacramento calif 
tuttle whose son robert is director of the white house 
personnel office is a california automotive dealer and 
industrialist jorgensen is chairman of a steel and aluminum 
distribution company and both men have been members of reagans 
kitchen cabinet of unofficial advisers 
an informal opinion by the ethics office noted that the 
president is subject to neither the criminal conflictofinterest 
laws nor standards of conduct for the executive branch of 
government set out in a 1965 presidential order 
if the group of businessmen decided to give the bel air estate 
to the reagans the president would not violate the standards of 
conduct regulations for the executive office of the president as 
long as personal friendship was the motivating factor in the 
transaction said the ethics office 
however it said the president must take care not to give 
preferential treatment to any of the approximately 20 investors 
the new documents were released after reporters made inquiries 
at the ethics office one of the law firms partners robert 
washington has represented the real estate holding company set up 
exclusively for the reagan house purchase wall management services 
inc 
the lawyers for wall management were seeking an opinion on the 
ethical and legal implications of buying and renovating a home for 
the reagans that would be sold or leased to the president 
based upon the facts as you have presented them to us it 
appears that your proposal will not run afoul of the applicable 
standards of conduct and conflict of interest statutes the 
opinion said 
the request to the ethics office did say the president has 
appointed some of the investors their spouses or relatives to 
various commissions or federal posts 
standards of conduct for the executive office of the president 
prohibit the use of public office for private gain or the giving of 
preferential treatment to anyone 
once this proposal gets under way the president and the 
individuals involved will have to be careful not to take any 
actions that would reflect adversely on standards of conduct 
matters said the opinion by thenethics office director david 
martin 
the reagans began paying rent on the home in the exclusive bel 
air section of los angeles under a threeyear lease which took 
effect march 1 the reagans have an option to buy and the white 
house says the first couple is paying fair market rent 
in an interview wall managements chief financial officer ira 
revich said approximately 20 friends of the reagans had bought 
stock in the company he refused to identify them the documents 
written in 1986 mention a group of about 18 individuals

swiss banks and large financial 
institutions will come under closer supervision in accepting funds 
from foreign leaders the swiss banking commission said 
the cases of deposed presidents ferdinand marcos of the 
philippines and jeanclaude duvalier of haiti created the need for 
the stronger surveillance the regulatory agency said tuesday in 
its annual report 
philippines officials claim marcos kept up to 5 billion in 
switzerland during his 20year rule duvalier is alleged to have 
diverted several hundred million dollars into swiss accounts both 
were ousted from office in 1986 
the commissions probe of the case failed to find any wrongdoing 
by the banks involved which were not named but the agency said it 
will now require top management of swiss banks rather than 
lowerranking employees to judge whether to take up or continue 
such exposed business ties 
the panel also called for tougher swiss laws against money 
laundering terming existing measures insufficient to combat the 
practice

albert gore jr sharpened his criticism of 
michael dukakis at a debate by the democratic candidates bluntly 
challenging the frontrunner on welfare prison management and the 
middle east 
jesse jackson stayed clear of the confrontation as gore and 
dukakis wrangled sometimes heatedly at tuesdays forum dukakis 
at one point indirectly suggested that gores candidacy may not 
last long 
dont lick your chops too soon governor dukakis gore 
responded new yorks going to have a bigger say about that than 
you will 
the sharp comment was one of several fired off by gore who has 
been waging an aggressive campaign in hopes of reviving his 
flagging candidacy three more democratic forums are planned before 
the states april 19 primary 
jackson played the conciliator admonishing the audience for 
booing gore and clearly enjoying the limelight after a lifetime as 
an underdog he said now im one of the top dogs and i just 
love it 
the booing came with gores first offensive in which he 
maintained that it was not a personal attack for him to 
criticize jacksons advocacy of a palestinian state gore went on 
to say dukakis had expressed a lot more enthusiasm for such a 
state than gore had 
i didnt express enthusiasm for a palestinian state dukakis 
shot back tapping a table top with his fingers i expressed 
enthusiasm for presidential leadership for peace in the region 
much is riding on the new york primary for gore who has yet to 
win a northern industrial state he has campaigned pugnaciously 
enough for some party leaders to call on him to tone down his 
criticisms of his opponents 
dukakis took that tack early on in the debate which was 
sponsored by the daily news ultimately this is a race against 
george bush the likely republican nominee he said 
but gore said in closing remarks its not a personal attack 
to note for the record that neither of my opponents has had a 
single days experience in foreign policy 
gore also launched a direct blast on the issue of welfare 
policy charging that dukakis new proposed state budget includes 
very very deep cuts in poverty programs 
thats absolutely incorrect dukakis responded 
the newspaper accounts are wrong then said gore 
no dukakis shot back youre wrong youre wrong 
dukakis budget plan proposes a 55 percent boost in aid to 
families with dependent children just enough to offset inflation 
the budget proposes more than 50 million for other new programs 
for the poor and homeless and afdc benefits have risen by 47 
percent the past five years 
gore also went after dukakis on prison policy saying the 
governor had backed a state program providing twoweek furloughs to 
prisoners including convicted murderers in which 11 prisoners 
fled and two killed again 
dukakis responded with some apparent rancor al the 
difference between you and me is that i have to run a criminal 
justice system he said you never have he cited low crime 
statistics in his state and said prisoners must be prepared to 
reenter society 
dukakis said his states program had been revised to exclude 
prisoners serving life terms and it was widely approved by 
correction professionals 
jackson rejected gores claim that new york favors underdogs 
i do not think that new york has an underdog complex he 
said i was an underdog for 45 years and 11 months and now im 
one of the top dogs and i just love it new york loves a winner 
and im a winner

for 74606 in unpaid rent the companys lawyer says 
the campaign was already about three months behind in rent 
payments for a suite of offices at greenbrier tower i when it moved 
out last december breaking its lease said roger schafer an 
attorney for greenbrier tower i associates 
the defendants have failed to make the required payment of the 
rent and late charges due under the lease and therefore are in 
default schafer said tuesday 
a spokesman for americans for robertson the candidates 
campaign organization said the campaign has been negotiating 
payment with its former landlords but was not aware that they 
planned to sue 
there have been negotiations between our offices on the terms 
of that lease and we have been working with them on a repayment 
schedule said barbara gattullo a campaign spokesman 
the campaign owes money to other vendors but is not being sued 
for payment by any other company ms gattullo said 
as far as i know this is an isolated case she said i do 
know we have made arrangements with many of our vendors to put them 
on a payment schedule but that is nothing unusual 
robertson a former religious broadcaster from virginia beach 
has lost a string of presidential primaries and acknowledges that 
he is unlikely to win the 1988 republican nomination 
americans for robertson has scaled back operations dramatically 
cutting staff and expenses to avoid exceeding federal campaign 
spending limits 
robertson initially had his national campaign headquarters at 
the suite of offices at greenbrier tower i but has relocated to 
more austere offices nearby 
robertson himself is being sued in the rent dispute because he 
signed the lease schafer said 
about 18000 of the 74606 is back rent robertsons campaign 
owed before it moved from the building schafer said robertson and 
his campaign owe the remainder for breaking the terms of the lease 
by moving he said 
the suit was filed in chesapeake circuit court last week but 
will not be processed until court clerks receive a filing fee that 
schafers office mailed tuesday he said

the closing of this years national peoples 
congress with its stress on reforms marks the end of the career 
of peng zhen a stodgy conservative who made the legislature into a 
force to be reckoned with 
pengs fiveyear term as chairman officially ended friday when 
he was replaced by reformminded former vice premier wan li 
the 86yearold peng was a harsh critic of senior leader deng 
xiaopings reforms of the past decade and developed his own power 
base in the legislature to slow down the pace of change 
he was a strong advocate of state control over economic 
political and social life in china and saw marketstyle economic 
reform and opening to the outside world as bringing in 
pernicious capitalist and western trends 
peng was believed to have been behind the january 1987 ouster of 
party chief hu yaobang who was blamed for prodemocracy student 
demonstrations staged in a dozen cities around the country that 
winter 
he was a leading figure in the campaign against bourgeois 
liberalization or western ideas that followed the protests 
several leading intellectuals were purged from the party as a 
result 
pengs leadership role in the congress began in 1979 not long 
after he returned to beijing from the mountains of shaanxi 
province where he had spent the cultural revolution years 
he was made head of the congress legislative committee and 
drafted a criminal code that was adopted the same year 
peng presented a new state constitution to the congress in 1982 
that substantially increased the powers of the legislature 
the constitution gave the congress until then a powerless and 
largely ceremonial body the power to enact laws and supervise the 
state council 
the following year peng became chairman of the legislature and 
under his leadership it began to shed its image as a rubber stamp 
for all party dictates 
peng shrugged off suggestions that he was an antideng xiaoping 
conservative and like all chinese leaders claimed loyalty to 
the idea of reform but he also openly criticized the decline of 
orthodox marxist principles and warned of the dangers of 
liberalization 
pengs official biography says he was born in 1902 to a peasant 
family in shanxi province and joined the communist party in 1923 
he rose through the party ranks acquiring a reputation for his 
organizational and administrative skills 
unlike most of his contemporaries peng did not participate in 
the long march and therefore did not establish early ties with mao 
tsetung but he was closely associated with former president liu 
shaoqi 
he became mayor of beijing in 1951 and directed mass executions 
of counterrevolutionaries in the capital that same year 
he continued to live up to his reputation for heavyhanded 
methods as one of the main forces behind a major anticrime 
campaign launched in 1983 that in four years has resulted in the 
executions of more than 10000 criminals 
peng was one of the first victims of the 196676 cultural 
revolution accused of attempting to stage a coup against mao 
he was stripped of all his posts banished for 12 years to the 
chining mountains of shaanxi province and not rehabilitated until 
1979

the police chiefs abrupt resignation amid 
controversy over minority shootings and the killing of three 
officers has prompted one city leader to demand that his successor 
be an outsider and black 
billy prince 45 announced his immediate resignation on 
tuesday saying he had realized on easter sunday at the end of an 
11day vacation that he dreaded returning to work 
i feel kind of runover here said prince who has been a 
policeman for 24 years six of them as chief its come to the 
point when its time to let someone else get in the middle and 
thats what ive decided to do 
within minutes the citys ranking black elected official city 
councilwoman diane ragsdale called for hiring a black police chief 
from outside dallas 
i think it would be a sad mistake for the police chief not to 
come from outside this city ms ragsdale who has sharply 
criticized police relations with minorities said tuesday 
we dont need contaminated leadership mired in the past 
she said we need brand new leadership to bring this city into 
the 20th century 
city manager richard knight who is black named first assistant 
police chief louie c caudell a white as interim chief in the 
nations seventhlargest city 
knight who has hiring authority said he has not decided 
whether he would continue the 43year tradition of promoting a new 
chief from within the department 
we have invited any internal candidates who are interested to 
by all means apply and we will also be looking nationally 
knight said 
prince came under fire for criticizing city council members and 
opposing reforms in his department which came under congressional 
review because of police shootings most of them black and hispanic 
he has been caught between the demands of city council members 
who want more police accountability including broader powers of a 
civilian review board and the dallas police association a private 
coalition that opposes greater control 
he was rebuked by knight and mayor annette strauss when he said 
criticism of the department had created a climate of hostility that 
set the stage for the january slaying of officer john glenn chase 
by a vagrant goaded by black youths 
although the three publicly reconciled the rift continued to 
grow 
prince said his decision to resign was totally my own and 
that he would serve as an adviser through the summer i dont 
want to be a lameduck leader or a lameduck chief he said 
two other officers were slain this year and prince ordered 
officers to patrol in pairs for safety 
the chase shooting and the feud produced a backlash of support 
for the police in dallas and the dpa collected 20000 signatures 
to force a referendum on the review board 
the departments problems continue last week a state judge 
held the city liable for damages in a wrongful death lawsuit 
brought by the widow of a suburban officer killed by a dallas 
officer in a bungled drug raid 
the judge found the dallas department had withheld evidence in 
the case

chinas parliament today ended an annual 20day 
session hailed as its most democratic and open ever by passing laws 
that reconfirm the governments commitment to economic reform 
the national peoples congress 2900 delegates approved a 
government work report by premier li peng urging more 
marketoriented reforms while acknowledging serious problems with 
rising prices and faltering agricultural production there were 
three opposing votes and six abstentions 
the congress produced few surprises and solidified communist 
party leader zhao ziyangs position as the nations strongest 
political figure behind his mentor semiretired senior leader deng 
xiaoping 
zhao 69 who became party chief last year after seven years as 
premier advocates further opening to the outside world and a rapid 
shift away from central planning and toward a more efficient 
competitive economy 
the congress as expected named gen yang shangkun as state 
president and wan li as chairman of the congress both are allies 
of deng and zhao and solid supporters of reform they replaced the 
conservative li xiannian and peng zhen 
on tuesday the legislature also named a new state council or 
parliament that stressed continuity with zhaos policies a 
majority of ministers either retained their posts or turned them 
over to younger bureaucrats within their ministries 
li peng 59 who was confirmed as premier earlier in the 
session is regarded as more concerned with economic stability than 
reform but his work report delivered on the opening day of the 
session backed zhaos reform program tempered only by several 
warnings against being too impetuous in revamping the economic 
system 
the official xinhua news agency said more than 100 changes were 
made in the final version of the report with more emphasis given 
to education and the issue of chinas minority nationalities 
the revised report encourages employees of universities and 
institutes to provide paid social services a controversial issue 
that has spurred protests during the congress by students and 
teachers who say education is underfunded and that academics should 
not be made to do outside work to boost college incomes and 
compensate for low salaries 
the report emphasizes the importance of protecting the rights of 
chinas minorities buddhist monks in tibet in the past six months 
have led violent demonstrations against what they say is oppression 
by authorities in beijing 
the delegates passed with two opposing votes and 11 
abstentions an enterprise law which is to end direct state 
controls over state enterprises and give factory managers greater 
authority over their operations 
under the law managers will be responsible for profits and 
losses and after consultation with local worker unions can decide 
on hiring and firing bonuses and punishments for workers 
the party secretaries who previously had final say over business 
operations are ordered not to interfere with daytoday affairs 
other bills passed included a jointventure law guaranteeing 
that foreign investors will have a favorable climate for investing 
in chinese industry and a bill making hainan island off the 
southern coast of china into a province 
hainan also was declared a special economic zone giving it 
powers to offer better conditions in order to attract foreign 
investment 
during the nationally televised final session several delegates 
stood up to state opinions about the activities of the congress 
one woman delegate voiced concern that the government might not 
give proper attention to the opinions raised by delegates during 
the session another deputy complained that he had received the 
revised version of the enterprise law only that morning and did not 
have time to study it properly 
a woman delegate from hong kong said she was unhappy with a line 
in lis work report criticizing capitalism china has promised hong 
kong it can keep its capitalist system after britain returns the 
colony to china in 1997 
zhao deng and others on the podium could be seen listening

the state supreme court canceled the 
gubernatorial recall election denying evan mecham a last 
desperate chance to return to office in what could be the final 
word to 15 months of political upheaval 
the court did not provide a detailed explanation of tuesdays 
41 decision which means the new governor democrat rose mofford 
would serve out mechams term through 1990 
the 65yearold former secretary of state became governor on 
april 4 when her republican predecessor was convicted on 
impeachment charges by the senate 
the court said that since mecham already has been removed the 
regular order of succession must take precedence over the state 
constitutions recall provisions 
mecham recall committee founder ed buck who had favored holding 
the election said his reaction still was one of relief 
im a little bit disappointed because i think a recall 
election would have given us the opportunity to put evan mecham 
behind us once and for all buck said because evan mecham 
would have received so few votes that he and his supporters would 
see how weak evan mecham really was 
the former governor said he planned to make a statement this 
evening about his plans 
weve been handed a bucket of lemons and were going to make a 
barrel of lemonade mecham told supporters in mesa there isnt 
anything in the law in the constitution that says that the 
supreme court can cancel this election 
mecham was removed last week from the ballot in the may 17 
election which was called after nearly 400000 arizonans signed 
petitions last year he would have faced a court battle if he 
decided to attempt a candidacy 
the recall was challenged by two taxpayers who contended it was 
no longer necessary and would be a waste of money their attorney 
andrew gordon told the court tuesday the purpose of the recall 
has been fulfilled recall is the peoples alternative to 
impeachment 
mrs mofford returned to phoenix on tuesday from washington 
dc where she had been lobbying for the central arizona project 
and for the state bid for a federal atomsmasher 
i can see that the constitution is working in arizona working 
well she told reporters im glad to be home and looking 
forward to moving ahead in arizona 
however republican recall candidate jack londen said he would 
consider challenging the supreme court decision in federal court 
he said he thought the decision violated his due process rights as 
a candidate and taxpayer 
im shocked londen said adding that he believes the 
constitution allows voters to recall a governor and choose the next 
one 
mecham 63 was convicted by the senate of trying to thwart a 
death threat investigation and misusing 80000 from the governors 
protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership 
he still faces a may 19 criminal trial on charges of concealing 
a 350000 campaign loan 
republican recall candidate john rhodes the 71yearold former 
us house minority leader issued a statement saying he was 
disappointed but was willing to support mrs mofford 
like the little boy that abraham lincoln told about im too 
old to cry but it hurts too much to laugh said rhodes who had 
planned to hold a fundraiser tuesday night in washington dc

for more than a decade algeria has 
played a pivotal role in crises involving hostages from a 1977 
airline hijacking by japanese terrorists to this weeks grim 
odyssey of a commandeered kuwait airways jet 
at one point algeria adopted a policy of not accepting 
hijackers after it drew critical reaction for mediating deals and 
was accused of being a sanctuary for terrorists 
but it gained international prestige for helping end the crisis 
in which 52 americans were held by iranian revolutionaries who 
seized the us embassy in tehran on nov 4 1979 the hostages 
were held for 444 days before being flown from iran to algeria and 
freedom in january 1981 
the nonaligned north african nation uses secret diplomacy and 
maintains a practice in diplomatic exchanges of following other 
countries wishes 
in 1985 trans world airline flight 847 carrying 145 passengers 
and eight crew members flew twice to algeria in a harrowing 
journey that began june 14 and ended 17 days later 
on the first day 19 us women an american child and three 
people of other nationalities were released at the algiers airport 
the plane flew to beirut lebanon the following day and then 
returned to algiers where 53 additional passengers and five flight 
attendants were freed in exchange for the release of a comrade of 
the hijackers at the athens airport 
starting in november 1980 algeria reluctantly agreed to work as 
mediator in usiranian negotiations to free the captive embassy 
personnel in tehran 
a happy ending might change the american view that we are 
communists a senior algerian official said at the time 
in october 1977 algerian officials negotiated facetoface at 
the foot of a japanese airlines dc8 hijacked by japanese red army 
guerrillas the negotiators secured the release of the hostages in 
exchange for a 6 million ransom payment and the release of six red 
army members in japanese jails 
officials later indicated the hijackers were allowed to slip out 
of the country 
algeria had agreed to let the plane land after a written request 
from the japanese government but it was roundly denounced by 
people who said algeria was too lax with the hijackers 
in a statement later the government of thenpresident houari 
boumedienne made it clear algeria would not agree to use force 
against hijackers 
experience has shown that it is only by accepting the demands 
of hijackers that it has been possible to save the lives of 
hijacked passengers said the statement transmitted by the 
official algerian news agency 
all those who disagree can go ask the opinion of hijacked 
passengers it added

democrats in the house and senate went behind 
closed doors to begin deciding who among them will be delegates to 
the democratic national convention while a tight presidential race 
hangs in the balance 
were proceeding on the basis of seniority senate majority 
leader robert byrd dwva said tuesday evening as he emerged 
from the capitols lyndon b johnson room after a halfhour closed 
session to nominate 32 senators to be delegates 
the house and senate democrats next week finish the selection of 
more than 250 of their members who will be delegates representing 
more than a third of as many as 646 super delegates to the 
national convention 
tuesdays meetings were secret despite a provision in the 
democratic partys charter that requires all meetings held under 
its auspices to be open to the public 
we really have no authority on their rules said jim carey 
executive director of the partys compliance assistance commission 
which is charged with enforcement of the rules they have every 
right to decide how their meetings are run 
carey said the house democratic caucus and the democratic 
conference of the senate are not official democratic national 
committee entities even though both are picking delegates to go 
to the national convention and the rules for picking the delegates 
were approved by his commission which also helped to write them 
among the 32 senators nominated tuesday was sen barbara 
mikulski dmd a freshman who was picked because she is the only 
democratic female in the senate according to byrd 
byrd did not name any other senators on the list and did not say 
whether every senator wanting to be a delegate had been nominated 
an aide to sen carl levin of michigan said levin also is among 
the 32 senators nominated 
however senate sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that some lowseniority senators who had asked to be delegates 
were not nominated 
those senators and others get a second crack at being picked 
nominations to fill the remaining 11 delegate slots from the senate 
had to be filed by noon on friday lists of nominees are to be 
circulated among democratic senators who will vote next week 
this weeks meeting and the lists of nominees are secret 
next weeks vote is to be in public 
i think that this will probably be a five to sixsecond 
operation linda peek a spokeswoman for the senate democrats 
said of the actual election of senate delegates the names are 
read the conference votes and the names are released within a 
matter of minutes i dont see any reason to believe that we are 
attempting to elect these delegates in any kind of closed fashion 
house democrats meanwhile were holding 12 regional meetings on 
tuesday and today to nominate 153 of their members another 51 
could be nominated individually by the end of today 
those meetings too were held behind closed doors 
i just dont know by what authority it is closed said mark 
mcburney a spokesman for the house democrats 
the house nominees will be considered at a house democratic 
caucus meeting next week 
the super delegates who include members of the democratic 
national committee governors and other current or former party 
leaders do not have to pledge their support to any presidential 
candidate or declare themselves uncommitted as a condition of 
becoming a delegate 
the other 3517 delegates to the convention do have to make such 
a declaration and were being picked through the series of primaries 
and caucuses across the country and overseas

primary elections and caucuses in other 
states have narrowed the democratic presidential field but have 
produced no detectable bandwagon effects among ohio super 
delegates to the partys national convention 
a survey showed tuesday that of the 15 ohio democrats assured of 
being convention delegates six remained in support of choices 
announced earlier and the others were still undecided three could 
not be reached including one delegate who has been out of touch 
with the state party for many months 
in the last ap poll of ohio super delegates march 4 there were 
two votes each for jesse jackson and massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis while sen paul simon of illinois and sen albert gore of 
tennessee had one each 
ohio will send between 180190 delegates to the democratic 
convention in atlanta on july 1518 after an involved process that 
includes the may 3 primary in which 104 delegates will be elected 
from ohios 21 congressional districts 
fiftythree will be elected statewide may 3 and an undetermined 
number of ohios 13 democratic members of congress probably most 
will also be added to the present 15 super delegates

the island of 6 million people became chinas 30th 
provinciallevel government and will be allowed to keep all its 
foreign exchange earnings 
already thousands of young and unemployed are streaming into 
the island creating problems for local officials hainan 
authorities have now received 150000 letters from jobseekers and 
say 26000 people have come to the island in search of work only a 
tenth of them have received jobs china daily said 
zeng peiyan vice minister of the electronics industry said his 
office is already negotiating with the world bank to finance 
various projects 
by making these changes china hopes it can catch up with its 
rivals in asia and give the four economic tigers of singapore 
hong kong taiwan and south korea a run for their money 
liang xiang head of the hainan preparatory group said he has a 
formula to make the island a success the three freedoms of 
inflow and outflow of capital import and export of goods and 
entry and exit of foreigners 
despite the freedom there will still be a lot of restrictions 
our market economy differs from the free economy in hong kong 
or other capitalist forms of free economy liang said in a 
statement carried by the official xinhua news agency 
the state will still control railways shipping 
telecommunications banks and other economic lifelines in this 
way liang said we shall not deviate from the socialist economic 
orbit 
there also are doubts over whether china can overcome the 
problems standing in the way of making hainan island a center of 
commerce 
there is a serious lack of infrastructure people still work the 
land buildings date from the early decades of the century housing 
is in short supply and some peasants live in huts of mud and straw 
and go without electricity 
travel is difficult and there are few flights to the region 
previously part of guangdong province 
the chinese say new highways deepwater ports railways and 
power stations will be built and that all projects that would be 
helpful to the islands economic development will be encouraged

some of the hostages released by the arab 
hijackers of a kuwaiti jumbo jet said they were well treated during 
eight days in captivity and did not know their captors had killed 
two passengers 
the hostages were among 12 freed tuesday in larnaca just hours 
before the kuwaiti airways boeing 747 left with about 35 other 
hostages and six to eight moslem shiite hijackers for algeria 
where the plane landed early today 
we were not beaten we were not harassed they treated us very 
nicely said sherif mahbojh badrawi said a cairobased ticketing 
agent for kuwait airways badrawi and other passengers spoke to 
reporters in larnaca general hospital like other freed hostages 
he looked tired as he sat on a bed 
i didnt see them harming anyone said badrawi 
the only time we felt scared was when we went to the bathroom 
or wanted a drink because they had pistols pointed at our head 
whichever way we went we were all kept in the center of the 
plane 
the hijackers killed two kuwaiti hostages on saturday and 
monday dumping their bodies on the larnaca airport tarmac the 
plane had been at larnaca for five days 
mohammed kamel sayyid rehan a 32yearold egyptian who works as 
a caterer for the airline also said he and his fellow hostages 
were treated well 
he said none of the passengers was aware of the killings 
rehan was returning from a threeday holiday in thailand when 
the plane was seized april 5 on a flight from bangkok thailands 
capital to kuwait he asked several times how he could get in 
touch with his wife and four children 
most of the 12 passengers freed tuesday wore pajamas as they sat 
or lay on beds at the hospital some with intravenous tubes in 
their arms 
dr george olympios who examined the 12 said they appeared 
healthy 
no one is in a grave condition olympios said most are in 
good health but are staying for observation nothing serious apart 
from fatigue 
there were marks on the wrists of most of them apparently 
from plastic strips used for binding he said 
badrawi and rehan said they could not give a precise number of 
hijackers but that all were well armed 
we saw all kinds of arms badrawi said they had automatic 
rifles grenades pistols we always saw them in pairs i saw six 
all together once they would cover their heads 
we saw many weapons rehan said i also saw mines 
saadi yousef quttaineh a 60yearold jordanian who lives in 
kuwait with his family of six said i was relaxed all the time 
except in the beginning i was a bit afraid 
they would move us from one place to another all together in 
a group we received good treatment we got enough water and food 
badrawi described the hijackers as good moslems 
he said they spoke to us in a very koranic language using 
phrases and words common to the moslem holy book they were 
always using verses from the koran

housing and urban development secretary samuel 
r pierce says federal housing officials plan to significantly 
increase the number of people getting vouchers to help pay their 
rent 
the voucher program the reagan administrations alternative to 
building more public housing now assists about 100000 lowincome 
families with another 34000 to be added by the fall pierce told 
a house appropriations subcommittee 
hud plans to add another 100000 families in 1989 he said 
tuesday 
rather than subsidizing housing units the program gives poor 
families a voucher which can be used to pay a portion of the rent 
on living space they choose for themselves the value of the 
voucher is fixed according to each familys income leaving the 
amount of additional rent flexible the program was made permanent 
by congress last year 
vouchers give families the dignity of choice offering them 
the opportunity to locate near family and friends schools 
churches and jobs rather than in public housing projects said 
pierce he appeared before the subcommittee on hudindependent 
agencies to discuss his 216 billion budget request for fiscal 
1989 huds 1988 budget is 186 billion 
pierce said the number of households to be assisted by various 
hud programs would increase from 43 million in 1988 to 44 million 
next year

the bureau of land management says it is going 
to decide whether recent allegations of cruelty to animals should 
mean an end to its practice of giving away large numbers of wild 
horses 
were putting the largescale adoptions under an intensive 
review blm spokesman tim locke said tuesday but he declined to 
confirm a report that the nofee largeherd adoption program 
had been suspended 
since the mid1970s the bureau has offered for adoption the 
wild horses taken in its roundups from the western range on payment 
of 125 
use of the term adoption is really a marketing tool since 
after a year the bureau gives the foster parent title to the 
horse 
since 1984 the bureau has waived the fee for people willing to 
take 100 animals or more 
locke said the review was prompted by recent allegations of 
abuse including one at sheyenne nd where earlier this month 
bureau officials reclaimed what was left of a herd of 400 horses on 
a ranch there 
the grand forks nd herald last week quoted john boyles head 
of the bureaus wild horse and burro division as saying were 
not approving any more than those already approved 
both boyles and robert burford director of the bureau were 
traveling tuesday and unavailable for comment locke would say 
only the instruction memo has not been issued largescale 
adoptions are still in our regs

seven hours after amtrak train no 392 began its 
run five people were dead killed in two separate grade crossing 
accidents that an amtrak official says the train crew could not 
have prevented 
they were powerless to avoid the accidents and no 
disciplinary action is planned debbie marciniak an amtrak 
spokeswoman said tuesday after the accidents 150 miles and 3 
hours apart 
that does not make the deaths of a young couple and two of their 
children then later of a 20yearold woman any easier on the 
crewmen who made the 300mile carbondaletochicago run tuesday 
you dont forget things like this you get the shakes 
said engineer tb parker whose fireman was at the throttle late 
monday when the first accident occurred killing the young couple 
and the children 
the victims were identified as cecil ray chandler 26 of la 
clede in south illinois his wife brenda 25 their 4yearold 
daughter kerry and their 3yearold son carl police said 
parker said he and his partner fireman william white 55 saw 
the chandler car on illinois 37 near effingham about 90 minutes 
into the run 
the car made a right turn and kept on going at a slow rate of 
speed across the track about 60 feet from the highway parker 
said 
i could see the female occupant of the car and she never 
looked at us i thought i saw the woman holding a child 
mr white had already applied the brakes parker said he 
started blowing the whistle then we put the brakes in emergency 
but it was too late 
he said the engine had been traveling about 76 mph a speed ms 
marciniak said was within the maximum allowed for that area 
the train was delayed about an hour and then headed north from 
kankakee traveling at the maximum 79 mph parker said 
as we were moving on we saw a car approaching rapidly from 
the west he said the crossing signals were working the gates 
were down and we were blowing the whistle 
the driver allegedly skirted the horizontal warning gates and 
struck the trains front wheels causing what parker described as 
a minor jolt that destroyed the vehicle and killed annette 
hanshew 20 who lived near bourbonnais authorities said 
ms marciniak said the crossing in the first accident had a 
warning sign and the second had crossing gates she said the 
federal railroad administration had contacted amtrak about the 
accidents 
the illinois commerce commission said it could find no 
obstructions or other factors that caused the first accident 
it is sort of puzzling from our standpoint said dan drewes 
the agencys assistant chief engineer in springfield 
one of two tracks on the solid timber crossing needs repair but 
isnt believed to be a factor drewes said 
parker said he doesnt believe the chandler family saw the train 
at the crossing marked with a crossing symbol but with no gate or 
lights 
the family moved to illinois from mount airy nc said ronald 
pagel owner of pagel funeral home in edgewood chandler a former 
sawmill worker was unemployed he said adding the couple had 
three other children 
last year illinois ranked second nationally with 481 accidents 
at rail crossings ms marciniak said texas was first with 625

the federal communications commission 
wants to protect radio and tv station owners from frivolous license 
challenges that the agencys chief says make running a station a 
kind of russian roulette 
some of the commissions license renewal policies result in 
nothing short of extortion that is costly for station owners 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said tuesday in a speech to the 
national association of broadcasters convention 
im know youll agree that running your business as a kind of 
russian roulette cannot help but disserve the public interest 
patrick said on the closing day of the convention 
at license renewal time a station owner can face challenges by 
groups that want to compete for the license to use that stations 
frequency radio licenses must be renewed every seven years and tv 
licenses every five years 
challengers can easily structure an application that looks 
better than the record of the existing station because they do not 
have to prove they have the necessary financial and technical 
qualifications to run a station patrick said 
existing procedures give preference to certain applicants such 
as those who are female minority and from the local community the 
fcc has been concerned that existing procedures make it easy for 
sham applications those filed by groups that have recruited 
someone who fits the preference criteria so they will have an edge 
in the competition for the station license 
renewal challenges often are settled by a station owner making a 
financial payment to competing applicants he said 
petitions to deny are a useful and statutory part of the 
process where they identify bona fide problems patrick said 
but where they are filed in a bad faith attempt to extract money 
or concessions unrelated to any legitimate public interest 
concerns they are nothing short of extortion and it has to stop 
he mentioned specifically the case of wbbmtv in chicago which 
currently is facing challenges to its license renewal the 
proceeding may put some washington lawyers kids through college 
but i can think of other uses for the money that would be more 
beneficial to audiences in chicago patrick said 
the chairman said the fcc can take some actions to change 
policies governing the process without need for congressional 
action 
he said the commission will formulate policies that would give 
station owners who perform acceptably a reasonable expectation of 
renewal while ensuring that bona fide applicants can still mount 
a challenge

defense lawyers at the racketeering trial of 
rep mario biaggi may have thrown a prosecution witnesss entire 
testimony into doubt after getting her to admit she lied under oath 
near the end of her testimony tuesday the defense had former 
wedtech corp bookkeepper celia lewis admit on the witness stand 
that she had previously lied about meeting with prosecutors 
mrs lewis denied speaking with government lawyers three times 
before she was forced to own up after a prosecutor spoke with the 
judge 
you deliberately lied a few minutes ago didnt you when you 
said you had not met with the prosecutors defense attorney 
jeffrey glekel asked 
yes i did she replied 
the admission came after assistant us attorney mary shannon 
informed the judge first in private and then in open court that 
she had met with mrs lewis for about 90 minutes on monday evening 
and for 45 minutes tuesday morning 
the government has a duty us district judge constance 
baker motley told the jury to advise the court whenever a witness 
has said something which is not true which the government knows is 
not true 
although both sides declined to comment on the disclosure 
citing a gag order banning discussion of the case with reporters 
defense lawyers were visibly jubilant as they left the courtroom 
during a recess 
there was no allegation of wrongdoing by prosecutors who are 
allowed to speak with government witnesses before and after their 
testimony unless they are being crossexamined by the defense 
cross examination of mrs lewis was completed monday afternoon 
followed by redirect questioning by the prosecution 
biaggi dny his former law partner bernard ehrlich wedtech 
founder john mariotta and four others are accused of turning the 
nowbankrupt defense contractor into a racketeering enterprise that 
paid bribes in return for government contracts 
mrs lewis who began her testimony last week has directly 
linked mariotta to a 5 million slush fund she supervised for 
wedtech officials 
mrs lewis testifying with full immunity from the government 
also previously has topld the court she kept track of 50000 in 
payoffs wedtech officials allegedly gave former bronx borough 
president stanley simon another defendant 
in later testimony a lawyer who once worked in biaggis law 
firm said its political connections were what got the firm hired by 
wedtech 
they were paid for political connections said carlos 
cuevas a former associate at the law firm of biaggi amp ehrlich

former president chun doohwan today 
resigned all his public and political posts to accept 
responsibility for his brothers role in a massive corruption 
scandal 
chun looking tired and strained told a news conference he was 
resigning as chairman of the advisory council of state elders and 
as honorary president of the governing democratic justice party 
the former president said he was giving up the offices because 
he failed to prevent his brothers embezzling a fortune in cash 
land and stocks through government contacts he said his brother 
should be judged sternly 
i cannot but keenly feel that it was due entirely to my own 
incompetence and lack of discretion that i have failed to control 
and supervise my younger brother chun said 
chun doohwans resignation leaves him without any official 
positions and appears to signal his departure from politics as 
president of the advisory council he served as a principal adviser 
to the president 
chuns brother chun kyunghwan is awaiting trial on charges of 
embezzlement influence peddling and extortion while he was head of 
the semiofficial saemaul undong or new community development 
movement 
the younger chun was named to the post in 1981 while his 
brother was president and resigned last year the movement 
oversees rural and urban development projects 
government prosecutors say they have evidence that millions of 
dollars was stolen by the younger chun and his associates to build 
a private empire that operated under official protection 
some government officials are being investigated on suspicion 
they covered up protection to protect the presidents family the 
former president has not been implicated in the corruption probe 
i cannot refrain from being sorry that my foolish younger 
brother has committed scandalous acts and caused uneasiness of 
heart among the people the former president told reporters 
opposition parties demanded the elder chun cooperate with the 
probe into saemaul and prove he was not involved in the scandal 
the opposition party for peace and democracy which has charged 
the former president was involved in corruption demands he prove 
he was not involved in spiriting funds overseas 
the opposition hopes to make the saemaul revelations a major 
issue in the april 26 national assembly elections to embarrass the 
governing democratic justice party 
president roh taewoo who succeeded chun feb 25 is thought to 
have sanctioned the corruption probe to discredit his predecessor 
and undermine chuns attempts to retain power the former president 
reportedly wanted to use his advisory position to wield influence 
behind the scenes 
roh a former general helped put fellow general chun in power 
with military backing in 1980 but roh promised during last years 
presidential campaign to investigate allegations of widespread 
corruption under the chun administration

fabricated quotes to president reagan 
i dont think it is the proper way to do the job to put words 
into anybodys mouth especially your boss mouth gennady 
gerasimov said at a news conference tuesday 
im not going to this i think if i do this i will be 
discovered and fired

twice attributed to reagan statements the president did not make 
gerasimov speculated that the quotes were made up including one 
during a 1985 summit meeting between reagan and gorbachev in 
geneva because president reagan is not always talkative

spearheads uncovered in an apple 
orchard here and a human skull fragment found in kansas date back 
more than 10000 years and could be evidence of the first humans to 
walk the continent scientists say 
two workers installing underground sprinklers at rampr orchards 
last may stumbled upon stone spear points that could be 11000 
years old said c vance haynes a university of arizona professor 
of anthropology and geology 
this is probably one of the most exciting finds thats 
occurred in many many decades haynes said tuesday there is a 
possibility these were the first people into the new world 
artifacts uncovered so far in this central washington town 
include stone tools projectile points and bone implements no 
human remains have been found since formal excavation began monday 
scientists say 
however a human skull fragment discovered in kansas was 
recently shown by new dating techniques to be about 15400 years 
old reported larry martin a systematics and ecology professor at 
the university of kansas 
the skull fragment found in 1975 was dated using electron spin 
resonance which involves measuring the density of trapped 
electrons that accumulate in bone as a result of environmental 
radiation after the material is buried 
the fragment likely has a real shot at being one of the oldest 
americans martin curator of the universitys museum of natural 
history said last week 
haynes however said resonance is a much newer and less 
tried method than the carbon14 dating usually used in dating 
archaeological discoveries he said he was unaware of the kansas 
discovery and was reluctant to compare the two finds 
the washington artifacts have not been scientifically dated say 
archaeologists on the excavation team which includes 
representatives of washington state university the university of 
wyoming and the smithsonian institution 
the orchard workers initially unearthed about 20 stone pieces 
and an additional seven were found by archaeologists on monday 
many are socalled clovis points named after a new mexico site 
where such stone tools were initially discovered in the 1920s and 
1930s 
the points would have been used on the end of spears to stab 
mammals like elephants horses and bison said peter mehringer of 
washington state and director of the excavation project 
he too contended the find indicates people at least as old as 
any previously discovered in north america although finds on other 
continents may be as old as 40000 years 
clovis is the oldest north american culture for which we 
have duplicated evidence haynes said archaeologists on the 
scene said all previous clovis finds have been scientifically dated 
to about 11000 years ago 
richard daugherty a retired wsu professor involved in the 
digging said the clovis points which are fashioned from chipped 
rock are unique in their number and their size 
some are more than 8 inches long and are brown and cream in 
color 
this is the largest cache of clovis points ever found said 
dennis stanford of the smithsonian institution something real 
interesting was going on here that we cant explain the points are 
about twice the size they should be 
daugherty said scientists are not sure why they would be so big 
although haynes said the size could indicate ceremonial use

a fire at the wharncliffe volunteer 
fire department engulfed the building before firefighters could get 
their fire truck out officials say 
i was just devastated said fire chief james dotson 
dotson said he arrived at the firehouse early tuesday to find a 
storage building connected to the station engulfed in flames 
the firehouse was still intact and dotson opened the station 
door intending to move the engine but the heat was so intense it 
drove him back his protective gear was of no use because it was 
inside the station too 
firefighters from nearby gilbert were called to wharncliffe when 
the blaze was reported but it took them more than 30 minutes to 
negotiate the 13 miles of winding mountain roads between the towns 
by then the stations ceiling had fallen in and the front wall 
of the second floor fell in just as firefighters got into position 
there was no chance of saving either the truck nor any of the 
equipment said kendell simpson gilberts assistant fire chief 
i just could have cried said hazel toler a dispatcher in 
gilbert who said she saw the fire as she drove to work 
the fire probably was caused by old wiring authorities said 
wharncliffes fire truck and 50000 worth of equipment were 
destroyed officials said no one was in the building when the fire 
began and no one was injured 
firefighters managed to save a 1958 2000gallon tanker that was 
being repaired dotson said 
simpson said gilberts fire department will cover wharncliffe 
until it returns to operation expected within a week

sikh militants today fired into the air 
with automatic rifles and other weapons inside sikhisms holiest 
shrine 
there were no reports of injuries from the shooting which 
occurred at the golden temple during a religious holiday for the 
minority faith 
police said the 15minute burst of gunfire panicked devotees 
trying to visit the temple for baisakhi the anniversary of guru 
gobind singhs introduction of the socalled baptism by sword for 
sikhs in 1699 
the new evidence of militants keeping weapons inside the shrine 
came as tensions were increasing over the sikh radicals demand for 
an independent nation they call khalistan or land of the pure 
in the punjabi language 
police also said for the first time that the militants were 
building fortifications inside the temple complex and chipping 
gunholes into walls apparently to prevent police or soldiers from 
entering the shrine 
in june 1984 the indian army carried out a massive raid to 
drive militants from the golden temple and more than 1200 people 
were killed including jarnail singh bhindranwale a militant sikh 
preacher five months later prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by two sikh bodguards in revenge for the raid setting 
off antisikh rioting in which 2000 people died 
police say sikh separatists who have been fighting a guerrilla 
war for five years for an independent homeland in punjab often take 
refuge in the temple 
the united news of india reported at least 18 deaths in the last 
24 hours in punjab as sikh radicals kept up attacks to press their 
separatist demands more than 700 people have been killed this year 
in the northern state in attacks blamed on the radicals 
izhar alam amritsars police superintendent said it was not 
known why the militants fired inside the temple today except to 
mark the holiday 
he said the militants also raised flags of khalistan atop 
several buildings in the complex including the akal takht the 
socalled throne of immortals where the temples chief priest 
sits 
witnesses said 400 to 500 devotees visited the temple today 
compared with more than 20000 who used to come for the holiday in 
more peaceful times 
baisakhi marks the day when at a meeting of the sikh masses 
the 10th and final sikh guru called for five men to come forward 
and sacrifice their lives for the faith one by one they entered a 
tent and screams were heard 
in the end guru gobind singh presented the five men to the 
crowd all alive and called on sikhs to become soldiers of their 
faith he decreed sikhs would carry swords introducing militancy 
to the erstwhile pacifist faith 
the low turnout at the temple today may have been due to fears 
of trouble and the fact that a chief sikh priest jasbir singh 
rode called a meeting of all sikh organizations the same day at a 
seminary in southern punjab 
sikh radicals maintain a separate nation is needed to keep their 
minority sect from being overwhelmed by hindus who are more than 
80 percent of indias 780 million people sikhs make up 2 percent 
of the countrys population but they are a majority in punjab 
they allege discrimination by hindus

until now the pizza sold in moscow only vaguely 
resembled the americanstyle pie 
it usually consisted of a thick doughy crust smeared with 
tomato paste toppings when available included canned cold 
tomatoes sardines chopped egg or lumps of salt pork 
so it was no surprise when a crowd of muscovites lined up in 
lenin hills on tuesday for pizza from a specially equipped van that 
is part of a joint economic venture involving a new jersey company 
nearly 1200 slices costing 210 each were dispensed by the 
mobile pizzeria a threehour period by midafternoon workers 
couldnt say exactly how many slices were sold because some were 
given away 
the reaction is extraordinary said louis piancone 
president of roma food enterprises in piscataway nj at the 
vans first day of operation in moscow well be moving through 
the city to determine what the market is for opening pizza 
restaurants judging from today at just this location theres a 
market 
a new law allowing soviet firms to enter into joint ventures 
with foreign companies is one of the steps taken by mikhail s 
gorbachev to raise productivity and provide sorely needed consumer 
goods and services 
many western entrepreneurs have been wary however saying the 
rules require the joint firms director to be a soviet that 
hirings and firings must conform to soviet law and that the 
venture can compete with its western parent abroad 
since the law went into effect joint ventures have been signed 
involving coal paint and fertilizer production pepsico inc last 
fall signed a contract to have two pizza hut restaurants in moscow 
but they have not yet opened 
we thought this was a great opportunity we thought wed get 
the yankee spirit and come here and open this said piancones 
us partner shelley m zeiger standing in front of lettering on 
the van proclaiming the first american pizza in moscow 
zeiger said they intend to open as many as 25 pizza restaurants 
around moscow if the soviet government approves and demand is 
sufficient 
only tomato and cheese slices were sold tuesday but piancone 
said 20 toppings including meat would be sold starting today 
he said ingredients from the united states are being used now 
but company officials hope to use some soviet ingredients 
eventually 
this is part of the spirit of the joint venture zeiger 
said we hope to work with the soviet agricultural people so we 
can get tomatoes with just the right acidity for our recipes and 
the cheese we want to buy soviet cheese but it has to have the 
right fat content 
he said pizza will be sold for foreign currency in a few weeks 
but only when the van is parked near hotels and areas that 
frequented by tourists depending on its location the van will 
sell pizza for either rubles or foreign currency but not for both 
in the same day 
zeiger who operates a trenton nj real estate and import 
firm said 51 percent of the profits go to his soviet partners and 
the remainder to the new jersey company

defense attorneys for abbas 
hamadi asked a federal court to acquit the lebanese man charged in 
the kidnappings of two west germans in beirut 
in a surprise announcement tuesday a frankfurt state court said 
hamadis brother mohammed hamadi will be tried in a juvenile 
court 
that decision means mohammed hamadi charged with murder and air 
piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a twa jet faces a maximum 10year 
prison sentence if convicted an adult court could sentence him to 
a possible life term upon conviction 
abbas hamadi is accused of kidnapping two west germans in 
lebanon in january 1987 allegedly to force west germany to free his 
brother 
i had no direct or indirect involvement in the kidnappings 
abbas hamadi told the fivejudge panel tuesday after his attorneys 
concluded their final arguments 
earlier defense counsel ludwig hoeller told the court that his 
client did not contest charges of possessing explosives he 
recommended that hamadi be sentenced to one year in prison but 
added that hamadi should be released immediately because already he 
has served more than a year in investigative custody 
prosecutors last week asked for a prison sentence of 11 years 
on kidnapping coercion and explosives charges 
a verdict is expected next week 
hamadi is charged with kidnapping west german businessmen rudolf 
cordes and alfred schmidt in beirut in 1987 
cordes was seized at beirut airport on jan 17 1987 and schmidt 
was abducted from his beirut hotel room three days later schmidt 
was released last september in what his captors called a goodwill 
gesture while cordes remains in captivity 
much of the evidence against my client is based on testimony 
from witnesses of dubious credibility on hearsay and on 
interrogations that were conducted improperly chief defense 
counsel eckart hild hild said earlier tuesday 
federal prosecutor karlheinz schnarr said evidence including 
wiretaps and fingerprints proved conclusively that abbas hamadi 
was involved in the kidnappings 
the abductions came shortly after mohammed hamadi was arrested 
at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 carrying liquid explosives 
abbas hamadi was arrested in frankfurt on jan 26 1987 
mohammed hamadi was charged in february with murder hijacking 
hostagetaking and other crimes stemming from the june 1985 
hijacking of a twa jetliner to beirut during which a us navy 
diver was killed and 39 us citizens held hostage for 17 days 
a frankfurt state court on tuesday said mohammed hamadi would be 
tried in a youth court because the perpetration of the crime 
may have begun before he was age 21 the statement said the state 
prosecutors office in frankfurt listed mohammed hamadis birth 
date as june 13 164 
the state court has studied this case intensively and is 
convinced that it belongs in the juvenile court hesse state 
court spokesman thomas kehren said 
it is possible that the juvenile tribunal declines the case 
but that is highly unlikely under the circumstances kehren 
told the associated press in a telephone interview 
under west german law defendants age 21 or older at the time of 
the crime are considered adults those between 18 and 21 are 
adolescents and those under age 18 are juveniles adolescents as 
well as juveniles are tried in juvenile courts

anonymity said the ministry had received information through the 
japanese embassy in washington that the man detained in new jersey 
for possession of explosives was carrying a japanese passport

provide information to us investigators but declined to give 
further details

believe the man held in the united states may have a forged 
passport or may have obtained it illegally

send the fingerprints of the man detained for identification

the former wife of presidential candidate 
jeanmarie le pen says her exspouse is antiarab antisemitic and 
does not practice the morality he preaches to his extremeright 
followers 
he is profoundly antiarab pierrette le pen is quoted as 
saying in an interview in this months french version of rolling 
stone magazine appearing today 
i have always lived in the antisemitism of jeanmarie le pen 
he completely denies the existence of the nazi gas chambers 
ms le pen said her exhusband used racial slurs to refer to 
jews and called adolf hitler uncle dolphie when saying for 
instance uncle dolphie didnt go far enough 
she made similar comments in an interview published last week in 
the socialistleaning monthly magazine globe the statements have 
spiced up a presidential campaign described by french political 
observers as listless and lacking serious debate 
a spokesman for le pen alain vizier said neither he nor the 
candidate would comment on ms le pens remarks 
le pen 59 a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire has 
often been charged with racism but has won libel cases against his 
accusers 
running on an antiimmigration platform with slogans such as 
keep france french le pen says north african workers should be 
sent back home and social benefits should go first to the native 
french 
ms le pen who left her husband in 1984 after 25 years of 
marriage raised eyebrows last year when she appeared halfnude in 
playboy magazine in a series of seductive poses 
in the interviews she is quoted as saying that her willingness 
to divulge family secrets was aimed at getting back personal 
possessions including the ashes of her mother family photos 
letters furniture and money 
ms le pen is quoted as saying she has sued seven times for the 
return of her possessions and lost 
last fall le pen caused a scandal when he said during a radio 
interview that the question of whether nazi gas chambers existed 
was merely a detail of world war ii 
le pen leans heavily in his campaign rallies on the themes of 
god and family saying he is the only candidate to do so 
but ms le pen is quoted in rolling stone as saying that her 
former husband had no sense of the morality which should reign 
within a family and was completely contrary to the image he 
wants to give 
she said he did not strongly discipline the couples three 
daughters who she now says refuse to see their mother 
le pen whose national front party has 33 deputies in the 
577seat national assembly is ranked fourth in opinion polls 
behind socialist president francois mitterrand and the two main 
conservative candidates premier jacques chirac and former premier 
raymond barre 
the latest opinion polls give le pen as much as 12 percent of 
the vote

massachusetts institute of technology in cambridge 
oberlin college in ohio reported no change and nine schools did 
not provide information for brandeis informal survey 
some education experts were upbeat about the figures saying 
they appeared to point to an imminent reversal of a protracted 
downturn in black enrollment 
the most recent statistics supplied by the us census bureau 
show 286 percent of collegeage blacks enrolled in colleges and 
universities in 1986 compared to 334 percent in 1976 the low was 
261 percent in 1985 
if this survey is reflecting the national trend this is great 
news said bob hochstein spokesman for the carnegie foundation 
for the advancement of teaching when theyre up that 
dramatically it suggests that will be translated into increased 
enrollment 
it suggests that progress is being made and its a tribute 
to colleges and universities that have actively been pursuing 
enrollments said hochstein whose nonprofit foundation acts as a 
thinktank for american education 
others were more cautious 
it may result in an increase in enrollment said trevor 
chandler dean in residence at the council of graduate schools in 
washington but increased applications dont necessary translate 
into increased admissions 
six other colleges reported increases in black applications 
they are clemson university south carolina with 514 percent 
georgia institute of technology atlanta 374 percent rice 
university houston 33 percent claremont colleges california 
196 percent reed college portland ore 11 percent and the 
university of california at los angeles 103 percent 
the admissions office at syracruse university syracuse ny 
said figures were up from last year but did not break them down 
into a percentage increase in the survey brandeis provided a copy 
of results to the associated press 
applications in general also were up but in lagged far behind 
those from blacks alone claremont and clemson both with 15 
percent showed the highest overall rate of increase in 
applications 
brandeis spokesman bob mitchell said in a telephone interview 
tuesday that the colleges polled were picked at random with the 
intention of covering as large an area as possible 
admissions or minority recruitment officials at several colleges 
concurred in separate interviews that more aggressive courting of 
blacks in recent years likely played a role in the upswing 
rice spokesman bill noblitt said his college blanketed the 
country last year with information that minority scholarships 
were available to gifted blacks 
richard vos claremonts dean of admissions and finances said 
there was a lot of handwringing in the early 1980s when black 
admissions began declining and in our shop we spent more time 
and money on minority recruiting than in past years

little rocks suspended police chief 
apparently killed himself with a bullet to the head authorities 
said one day after he denounced a misdemeanor theft charge against 
him as unjust 
jeff f doc hale 47 was found dead tuesday at his home in 
this town 30 miles northeast of little rock said lonoke county 
sheriff jo isaac hales wife jean discovered his body in a 
laundry room when she came home for lunch isaac said 
little rock city manager tom dalton said the single gunshot 
wound appeared to be selfinflicted however isaac declined to 
speculate about the death until autopsy findings were released 
today 
no suicide note was found isaac said but friends said hale was 
disturbed about the allegations against him 
hale was suspended with pay until a charge was settled that he 
took less than 200 from a drugstore cash register in february and 
march buice drug store a popular hangout for politicians and 
police is owned by the son of state rep george wimberly 
wimberly the stores pharmacist is a former little rock mayor 
who has dabbled in police politics 
hale who was arrested by state police outside the drugstore 
march 10 said he had an unwritten arrangement with the elder 
wimberly to borrow money from the register other lawmen have said 
they took similar loans 
after a court appearance monday on the charge hale labeled the 
accusation a bunch of bull he was to have been tried may 24 
and faced up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine 
kenneth w collins hales neighbor of 17 years said that 
everything was normal when he and the chief did farm work 
monday afternoon although hale was concerned about the effect of 
his legal problems on his elderly mother 
hale promised to fight all this collins said 
we said hey doc what can we do to help collins said 
when i talked to him he said i dont drink i dont smoke i 
dont do anything wrong and i cant believe any of this stuff 
attorney general steve clark for whom hale directed medicaid 
fraud investigations for four years said the theft charge 
challenged at the core of what he held to be the most dear and 
that was his integrity and character 
clark added the pressure of that challenge and there had to 
be lots of it in some way influenced his thinking or his decision 
that led to his death 
flags were at halfstaff and officers wore black tape across 
badges at the little rock police department where hale was 
appointed chief oct 20 1986 he joined the department in 1962

the massachusetts legislature meeting in a 
marathon session delivered a firstinthenation universal health 
care bill to gov michael s dukakis by a narrow margin early today 
the state house accepted a housesenate compromise by a vote of 
7775 and the senate did the same by an 1815 margin those close 
votes came despite overwhelming democratic majorities in both 
chambers 
dukakis who has frequently pointed to the health care plan as a 
national model during his quest for the democratic presidential 
nomination has indicated support for the compromise legislative 
leaders said he could sign it as early as next week 
lawmakers adopted the plan to guarantee health insurance to all 
massachusetts residents by 1992 after nearly nine months of intense 
legislative debate and negotiations with a host of special 
interests 
its been very difficult senate ways and means chairman 
patricia mcgovern said its been the most difficult piece of 
legislation i have ever been involved with personally 
but mcgovern who first proposed universal health care for the 
state more than a year ago added i think it has the potential 
to be the most rewarding piece of legislation it really is 
landmark it is historic it is breaking new ground 
dukakis presidential ambitions were also raised at every turn 
in the drive to pass the bill i hear television commercials are 
being held up so the governor can run with this legislation in new 
york assistant minority leader kevin poirier said tuesday 
referring to the new york presidential primary april 19 
but a dukakis campaign spokesman denied the report i know of 
no such commercials in existence he said commercials arent 
made in advance you wait until things happen and then you put them 
together 
mcgovern and house ways and means chairman richard voke who 
cochaired the committee that reached the compromise and were floor 
leaders on the bill pointed to heavy lobbying from a multitude of 
special interests as the main factor in the close legislative 
voting 
businesses hospitals insurers labor unions and consumers all 
had concerns about the bill as late as tuesday labor unions were 
upset by a provision in the compromise bill that potentially could 
reduce public employee health care benefits by removing the issue 
from collective bargaining 
the health care bill sets jan 1 1992 as the deadline for 
businesses to begin offering health insurance to their employees or 
begin paying an surcharge to the state so it can provide coverage 
to the states estimated 600000 uninsured residents 
the bill includes tax breaks exemptions for businesses of five 
or fewer employees statesponsored pooled insurance and the 
possibility of outright state subsidies 
republican opponents repeatedly warned that the bill would raise 
business costs putting some out of business and discouraging 
expansion of others 
the twopart bill also renews the states hospital financing 
law containing about 1 billion in hospital fee increases over the 
next four years another 95 million in new revenues was added for 
42 hardpressed hospitals 
despite the legislatures lengthy consideration of the proposal 
some lawmakers were still asking late tuesday how much the bill 
will cost what it will offer the uninsured and how many people 
ultimately will take advantage of the program 
dukakis has budgeted 78 million in fiscal 1989 as the states 
share in the first full year of the fouryear universal health care 
phasein but cost estimates over the fouryear period vary widely 
from 550 million to 12 billion 
specific health plan coverage will be decided later by a new 
state agency set up to oversee the program

increased american investments in south africa 
may do more to erase apartheid than sanctions and disinvestment 
former president richard m nixon said today 
south africa has failed a moral litmus test on its policies 
toward blacks nixon said 
south africa presents a problem where everybody agrees we are 
against apartheid he said the question is what can we do 
about it 
he said sanctions and pulling out investments should be given a 
chance to work but if they dont we may have to go completely in 
the other direction 
i do know that american corporations are one of the most 
progressive forces for change and i think its really better to 
have them into south africa adopting policies providing equal 
opportunities and going far beyond that than their getting out and 
having south african racists running the country 
nixon made his remarks on nbctvs today program in the last 
of three interviews in connection with his seventh and latest book

premier ciriaco de mita the christian 
democrat leader today formed italys 48th postwar government and 
ended a monthlong political crisis triggered by the resignation of 
his predecessor giovanni goria 
the 60yearold de mita put together a coalition of his party 
the socialists social democrats republicans and liberals the 
same fiveparty alliance that has governed italy through most of 
the 1980s 
de mita presented his choice for the 32member cabinet to 
president francesco cossiga at the quirinal palace 
goria stepped down march 11 after eight turbulent months in 
office his coalition was weakened by factional disputes in his own 
christian democrat party as well as feuding with the socialists 
led by former premier bettino craxi 
leaders of the five parties agreed on the terms for the new 
government monday and the parties met again separately tuesday to 
give their final endorsement 
the crucial support came from the socialists the secondlargest 
party in the coalition and a frequent foil for the christian 
democrats who have led or dominated all italian governments since 
the end of world war ii 
most of de mitas cabinet members were holdovers from the 
previous goria government they included foreign minister giulio 
andreotti a christian democrat defense minister valerio zanone a 
liberal and treasury minister giuliano amato a socialist 
gianni de michelis a socialist was given the post of deputy 
premier previously held by amato 
goria did not join the new government as a minister 
with de mita holding both the premiership and his post as 
secretary of the christian democrat party at least for the time 
being the government was viewed as potentially stronger than 
gorias coalition 
but craxi said tuesday he thought it would be a miracle if 
de mitas government lasted through the end of the legislative term 
in 1992 
as required by the constitution de mita will seek a confidence 
vote in parliament where the coaliton holds a comfortable majority 
in both houses the vote is expected next week 
as a sign of the kind of problems de mita could face 
parliamentary deputies of the small social democrat party 
immediately protested their partys choice of its two cabinet 
ministers 
de mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties on monday 
agreed on proposed antitrust legislation for the italian media 
under the accord no individual or group can own or control both a 
newspaper and a television network 
the proposed law would also clear the way for live nationwide 
broadcasts by private networks 
on the controversial issue of nuclear power the parties put off 
a final decision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at 
montalto di castro near rome the socialists had demanded the plant 
be reconverted to another form of energy while the christian 
democrats favored completing the nuclear station

hundreds of weapons teams today 
combed streets for unexploded missiles from a weekend blast that 
showered rockets on residential areas and killed 96 people 
the government said tuesday that 170 teams of explosives experts 
were working around the clock and had cleared 20000 missiles 
grenades and other weapons from the streets of the twin cities of 
islamabad and rawalpindi 
the weapons rained down on residents after an explosion sunday 
at a army ammunition depot injuring nearly 1100 and causing 
secondary explosions and fire about 100 people remained missing 
today 
the government has said the blast may have been the work of 
saboteurs seeking to undermine pakistans position in talks on 
withdrawing soviet troops from afghanistan 
the defense ministry said today it would begin detonating 
unexploded ammunition in an unpopulated area near islamabad 
a fourman us team of explosives experts so far recovered 
about 20 fallen projectiles at american facilities including the 
us embassy 
medical vans roamed the streets and medical workers vaccinated 
people for cholera and typhoid the neighborhoods remained without 
water and electricity 
little pockets of fire still burned today at the ojeri army camp 
where the initial blast occurred many houses in surrounding 
neighborhoods were damaged and narrow alleys were littered with 
bricks twisted metal broken furniture and glass 
government teams inspected damage and promised compensation to 
victims within three days 
no official cause of the initial blast was given but defense 
minister rana naeem mahmoud said tuesday that military 
investigators are not ruling out the possibility of sabotage 
he said saboteurs might have been attempting to put pressure on 
pakistan before the signing of the geneva agreements on 
afghanistan scheduled for thursday pakistan has been supplying 
weapons to rebels fighting the sovietbacked afghan government 
eyewitnesses said they spotted burning trucks bearing afghan 
license plates sunday near the ammunition depot 
the disaster has prompted several small demonstrations accusing 
authorities of negligence some opposition leaders have called for 
president mohammad zia ulhaq to resign

israeli soldiers today shot and killed three 
arab guerrillas who were trying to infiltrate from lebanon on a 
hostagetaking mission the military said 
violent protests persisted for a second day in the gaza strip 
which was home to five of the eight palestinians whom israel 
deported to lebanon on monday hospital and relief officials said 
at least 21 arabs were injured 
israel says the deportees incited much of the violence in the 
occupied lands that has claimed the lives of 143 palestinians one 
israeli soldier and a tennage jewish settler since it began dec 8 
before dawn today soldiers on a routine patrol spotted the 
three guerrillas just north of the kfar yuval collective farm 
chased them and opened fire the army said in a statement 
the military communique did not give the affiliation of the 
guerrillas who carried out todays raid but said they were armed 
with m16 rifles four rockets and hand grenades it said they were 
on a hostagetaking mission but gave no other details 
it was the second attempted infiltration in nine days at the 
same location and the 10th across israels borders since november 
an april 5 attempt was claimed by two factions of yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization 
israeli officials have linked past guerrilla raids to the 
4monthold palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza which 
israel seized in the 1967 middle east war 
in the gaza strip united nations relief workers and arab 
hospital officials said soldiers opened fire today at protesters 
outside a school in jabaliya refugee camp wounding 14yearold 
diah ahmed jaber in the left thigh 
twenty other palestinians were injured by tear gas and rubber 
bullets said dr ahmed yassih of gaza citys shifa hospital where 
some of the injured were treated 
in the deir el balah refugee camp soldiers today confiscated 
identification documents from most of the men in the camp and told 
them they would have to pay their electricity and water bills 
before they would be returned said un official eric peterson an 
administrator of the camps 
the israeli military command said it was checking the reports 
the army said one arab died 25 were hurt and one soldier was 
injured tuesday in fighting in the west bank and gaza 
in another development today an israeli newspaper said an army 
inquiry into the killing of a jewish settler girl in the west bank 
village of beita last week indirectly would blame the shooting on 
the jewish guard roman aldubi who was knocked out by a rock during 
the melee and remains hospitalized 
a preliminary army probe determined that 15yearold tirza porat 
died from a bullet fired by aldubis m16 rifle settlers claim she 
was shot either by an arab who took the rifle or by an arab with 
another weapon israeli officers have said they believe aldubi 
accidentally fired the fatal shot in panic 
the hadashot newspaper said the final army report shows arabs 
wrested the rifle from aldubi but did not fire it the paper said 
the inquiry implies that aldubi accidentally shot the girl before 
he was knocked unconscious 
the controversy over the shooting caused a stormy session of 
parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee on tuesday 
during which the chief of staff lt gen dan shomron accused jewish 
settlers of trying to manipulate public opinion against the armys 
findings 
i hope and pray we dont reach the stage in which we have to 
have recourse to a polygraph test the jerusalem post quoted him 
as saying 
shomron has called the april 6 clash which occurred as the 
teenage settlers and two armed guards were on a holiday hike a 
misunderstanding and said residents of beita had sought to aid and 
protect the israeli youths 
the post also said shomron indicated the army razed 16 arab 
homes in beita before the investigation was concluded because it 
believed swift action was needed to prevent reprisals by settlers 
leftwing legislator yossi sarid accused the settlers of 
pressuring the army into taking the punitive measures even though 
it was not yet clear if any arabs were involved in killing the 
jewish girl the newspaper said 
ehud olmert of the rightwing likud bloc criticized the army for 
leaking findings on the shooting to the israeli media 
i recommend that army officers not make media appearances and 
then they wont be dragged into political debates olmert 
reportedly said

there were no takers for the former home 
of jim and tammy bakker and the ptl auction fell far short of its 
4 million goal but ministry officials say theyll keep trying to 
sell off excess property 
the auction tuesday brought in only 596500 toward the 53 
million the ptl ministry based in nearby fort mill needs to raise 
by a may 2 bankruptcy court deadline 
only five bids were accepted on nine properties offered bids on 
two others were insufficient and a 425000 bid on former ptl 
president richard dortchs home is still being considered ptl 
trustee david clark said 
there were no bids on the former residence of the bakkers the 
ministrys deposed founders clark said although several people 
have expressed a serious interest in the home 
its the kind of house that you have to have a special buyer 
for said clark and i think that person is the kind of person 
who might not come to an auction 
the auctioneer began the bidding at 900000 on the former 
bakker residence a 9300squarefoot lakeside home with 4 bedrooms 
and 5 bathrooms in tega cay 
but auctioneer rodney l robinson stopped the auction when he 
had dropped the price to 500000 without any takers 
we didnt get an offer that i thought was substantial enough 
to open the bidding robinson said afterward 
about 40 bidders participated in the 30minute auction 
one of the rejected bids was 900000 for 33 acres of 
undeveloped land clark said that property and all others remaining 
would now be sold through real estate agents 
we are not going to give away the assets of the church he 
said 
ptl has an estimated 60 million debt as well as a 60 million 
to 80 million claim of back taxes from the irs clark said 
ptl already has laid off almost 300 of the 1153 employees on 
hand at bakkers departure last year amid a sex scandal clark said 
tuesday that officials are reviewing all operations and will make 
further cutbacks if necessary

mean to be executed or why he was being executed 
shortly after midnight the us supreme court refused to issue 
a fifth stay of execution for him 
lowenfield was pronounced dead at 1225 am 
it was the nations fourth execution this year and louisianas 
second the state has put to death 17 murderers since it resumed 
executions in 1983 
it was also the 97th execution in the nation to be carried out 
since the 1976 us supreme court ruling legalizing the death 
penalty 
lowenfield a welder from guyana who came to the united states 
from canada in 1975 on a work permit spent most of his final hours 
with dale brown head basketball coach at louisiana state 
university and two spiritual advisers 
the murders occurred aug 30 1982 in the new orleans suburb of 
marrero prosecutors said lowenfield barged into his girlfriends 
house and shot everybody there including her 4yearold daughter 
as most of them were eating boiled crabs at a kitchen table 
the victims were the girlfriend sheila thomas 27 who was a 
jefferson parish sheriffs deputy her daughter shantel osborne 
4 ms thomas stepfather owen griffin 45 mother myrtle griffin 
44 and shantels father carl osborne 33 
before the 1984 trial lowenfield was found competent and he 
refused to allow his lawyers to use insanity as a defense 
insisting instead that he was in jacksonville fla at the time 
the family was killed 
prosecutors said lowenfield was jealous of osborne they said 
lowenfield and ms thomas had lived together in a stormy 
relationship until earlier in the summer of 1982 when he set the 
house on fire and she moved out 
he was convicted of three firstdegree murders and two 
manslaughters and received three death sentences 
two members of the victims family connie and byron encalade 
of harvey were in the front row of witnesses when lowenfield 
entered the execution chamber he addressed them first saying 
connie and byron i hope yall feel satisfied 
he then spoke briefly to his original defense lawyer the 
sheriffs detective who investigated the case and also the chief 
prosecutor 
then after professing his innocence lowenfield said thanks 
to yall peace 
brown a catholic priest and a catholic nun arrived about 9 pm 
tuesday to spend lowenfields final hours with him said warden 
hilton butler 
brown widely recognized as a motivational speaker had been 
corresponding with lowenfield since brown took the lsu team on a 
tour of angolas death row in 1984 butler said 
it was a lifetime here tonight a lifetime with leslie a 
lifetime with the warden you dont see it in the movies brown 
said after the execution i asked him several things can i ease 
the pain and he said no thank you

environmental groups armed with videotape 
of panamanian fishermen killing dozens of dolphins are suing the 
government to enforce an import ban on nations violating the marine 
mammal protection act 
the lawsuit filed in us district court tuesday against 
several federal agencies claims that they are allowing the illegal 
slaughter of hundreds of thousands of dolphins by failing to 
enforce the act 
the suit also asks that the commerce department be compelled to 
enforce requirements that the us tuna industry use the best 
equipment and safety measures to minimize the killing of dolphins 
each year tens to hundreds of thousands of dolphins which 
unlike tuna are expressly protected by federal law are brutally 
and needlessly killed and their battered and torn bodies discarded 
into the sea said the lawsuit by the earth island institute the 
marine mammal fund and berkeley environmentalist david r brower 
many dolphins die during tunafishing operations because they 
tend to congregate above the schools of tuna and nets trap both 
tuna and dolphins 
named in the suit in addition to commerce are the treasury 
department the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and 
the national marine fisheries service 
in washington noaa spokesman brian gorman called the lawsuit 
specious because it makes it sound as if were ignoring some 
regulations that havent gone into effect yet 
he said noaa which is part of the commerce department 
published regulations last month that go into effect next monday to 
force foreign tuna fleets to adhere to the same limits as american 
fleets or run the risk of having their tuna haul embargoed 
the us fishing industry has an overall dolphin kill limit of 
20500 a year and has abided by that limit gorman said foreign 
fleets selling tuna in the united states are supposed to abide by a 
comparable limit but gorman acknowledged some countries have 
ignored the quota 
according to the marine fisheries service 125000 dolphins or 
porpoises were killed annually by commercial fishermen between 1983 
and 1987 most of them by foreign fleets two years ago us 
fleets reached their quota in october and were ordered to suspend 
fishing for the rest of the year 
the 1972 marine mammal protection act proclaimed an immediate 
goal that the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of 
marine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing 
operations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero 
mortality and serious injury rate 
to achieve that goal congress granted the secretary of commerce 
the power to enforce the regulations of the act 
dolphin kills are associated with yellowfin tuna fishing in the 
eastern tropical pacific ocean a 3000mile wide area that 
stretches from southern california to chile 
the tuna swim beneath schools of dolphins that glide near the 
waters surface tuna boats encircle the schools with giant purse 
seine nets that trap both the dolphins and the tuna 
as many dolphins as possible are supposed to be released but 
some inevitably die or are injured their beaks and flippers 
broken or ripped from their bodies when they become entangled in 
the nets the suit said

an accident that overturned two boats 
and swept a fisherman to his death under a lake okeechobee lock 
gate was probably caused by a 5foot chicken snake an investigator 
said 
sometimes the truth sounds very abstract said don grey of 
the florida marine patrol but im 95 percent positive as 
farfetched as it sounds i have to go with it 
the snake apparently crawled over an electrical switch while the 
two boats were in the chamber between the watercontrolling gates 
of a lock march 3 the locks are equipped with gates to change 
water levels to raise or lower boats so they can enter and leave 
lake okeechobee 
the reptiles weight probably about two pounds a snake expert 
said put enough pressure on the switch to send a signal one lock 
gate was shut when it actually was raised two to three feet grey 
said tuesday 
that triggered the raising of the other gate causing water to 
rush into the chamber prematurely swamping the boats and pulling 
hubert major 68 under one of the gates 
major a retired engineer who lived in lakeport drowned in the 
turbulent water the other boater donald blickenstaff of 
sharpsburg md was able to reach a ladder on the wall and climb 
out 
the south florida water management district has installed a 
second switch on the other side of the gate in an effort to prevent 
future accidents 
there will have to be a 15footlong snake or two snakes 
working in cahoots with each other to trip both of those switches 
now said francis davino contract locktender at lakeport 
chicken snakes also called yellow rat snakes are a common 
nonpoisonous family of reptiles that can grow to 7 feet they 
climb the lock structures to find warmth davino said

art scholar arnold rubin whose diverse 
interests took him from africa to pasadena as he studied everything 
from human tattoos to the annual tournament of roses parade has 
died at age 50 
rubin an associate professor of art history at the university 
of california los angeles died saturday of stomach cancer said 
his daughter hannele rubin 
he had just finished editing and contributing to an anthology on 
tattoos and other forms of body adornment titled marks on 
civilization 
we put holes in our noses or we dont we put plugs in our 
ears or we dont we put designs on our bodies or we dont rubin 
had said last month in discussing his studies of how human beings 
adorn their bodies 
he saw such actions as challenging the definitions of what it 
means to be civilized 
his study of the annual new years day tournament of roses 
parade in pasadena started while he was teaching a class on art 
research methods at ucla he recalled that he and his students 
decided to find a local art event that couldnt be judged by 
traditional standards 
he said the parade caught his interest because the floats were 
joint efforts unlike most art works which are created by a single 
artist and because the floats do not last as traditional art is 
supposed to 
the measure of art is not in its permanence he said of the 
parade this is a whole body of art born for a brief lifespan 
but this is still art 
rubin is survived by his daughter and a son gabriel

new premier li peng said today he believes in 
fighting to the end to get what he wants but dismissed reports he 
fights with communist party chief zhao ziyang over policy 
the major decisions are all products of collective 
discussion he told a news conference in the great hall of the 
people zhao and i have no differences on political issues 
li 59 an engineer by training generally sounds a more 
cautious tone that zhao in public statements emphasizing the need 
for economic stability over rapid change he was approved as 
premier during the 20day session of the national peoples congress 
that ended today 
zhao tends to emphasize the need for speedy action if china is 
to transform its ricepaddy economy into one capable of competing 
internationally in high technology 
there is some comment in the foreign press that zhao favors 
reform and opening to the outside world and im in favor of 
stabilizing the economy they somehow pit these two views against 
each other li said 
this is a misunderstanding the very purpose of reform is 
to bring about economic growth and sustained and steady economic 
growth in turn will facilitate the smooth pursuit of reform 
asked to describe his philosophy of life li said he believed in 
marxism but added i believe that if i set my mind to something i 
cant waver but have to stick it out to the end 
the official translator used a more colorful phrase in english 
than li chose in chinese quoting li as saying he believed in 
slugging it out 
lis news conference was reminiscent of one given by zhao last 
november immediately after being appointed party general secretary 
during that conference the first of its kind by a high chinese 
leader a highspirited zhao walked about the room shaking hands 
with reporters and clicking glasses with them as he fielded 
questions 
lis news conference was more formal he and his three vice 
premiers wu xueqian yao yilin and tian jiyun sat behind a 
table facing rows of seated reporters 
he appeared more relaxed than at past public appearances but 
refused to answer several questions including one about his 
experiences during the far leftist cultural revolution hundreds of 
thousands of chinese suffered during that violent campaign from 
196676 but li was protected by his adopted father then premier 
chou enlai 
asked if his own rapid rise in politics was due to his 
relationship with chou chinas most popular leader li said i 
think my promotion has nothing to do with him 
li was orphaned at 3 when his father was killed by nationalist 
troops in chinas civil war chou and his wife deng yingchao who 
had no children of their own adopted about 10 war orphans 
li attempted to portray his ties with chou as somewhat distant 
saying that as a youth he lived with fellow students not chou and 
deng and saw them only occasionally 
but their ideals and moral influence had a profound impact on 
my upbringing he said 
li said university students who have put up posters in the past 
week calling for more funds for education are welcome to 
voice their opinion much of which is correct 
he played down the significance of the posters and of a sitin 
sunday in tiananmen square by 18 students and teachers he said 
chinese have the right to express their views but within the 
scope allowed by law 
li also said china would welcome talks with the exiled leader of 
tibetan buddhism the dalai lama 
the panchen lama tibetan buddhisms secondhighest leader and a 
supporter of chinese rule indicated last week that the dalai lama 
would be allowed to live in tibet if he returned to china from his 
indian exile

two of its members bill weinberg and paul ilyinsky cracked 
jokes at the time that athans took to be ethnic slurs he called 
the remarks very ugly 
both councilmen apologized and weinberg said they have come 
to a common agreement and we now have a little agape between us

backers of a drive to recall mayor federico pena 
were racing to meet todays deadline for filing petitions with 
enough signatures to force a new mayoral election 
were counting them every minute said recall organizer 
marge doty who launched the recall effort of the metropolitan 
action committee in january its looking real good 
the recall drive was launched late last year by a group angered 
over what they claimed was fiscal mismanagement by the pena 
administration the campaign gained momentum after many residents 
were left stranded for several days by a major holiday snow storm 
while pena was vacationing outofstate 
doty expressed optimism there would be a recall but stopped 
short tuesday of a promise to deliver the necessary 39091 
signatures of registered denver voters to the denver election 
commission that number is 25 percent of the total number of votes 
cast in the last mayoral election 
i hope so doty said adding thats not a yes or a no 
doty said volunteers worked late tuesday to check the signatures 
for accuracy only an unusual run of invalid signatures could block 
the drive doty said i dont think were going to find that im 
not seeing that now 
while there is some dispute about procedures denvers charter 
calls for an entirely new election 
any candidate who collected 300 names on a nominating petition 
could run and if no candidate mustered a clear majority a runoff 
would be held next 
susan duncan head of a volunteer committee of recall opponents 
predicts there will be enough errors in the petitions to thwart the 
recall 
some 300 pena supporters planned to gather at state democratic 
headquarters early thursday to begin checking and challenging the 
signatures

a judge rejected a jurys recommendation and 
sentenced a former state trooper to the electric chair in the 
slaying of his trooper girlfriend because the killing was a planned 
execution 
prosecutors said elizabeth cobb 31 was fatally shot in a plot 
by joe duncan to collect 350000 in life insurance benefits 
the killing was a premeditated diabolic planned execution 
dallas county circuit judge jc norton said tuesday at the hearing 
where he ordered that duncan be executed instead of serving a life 
sentence 
duncan whose attorneys said they would seek a new trial told 
the judge at the hearing that he did not kill miss cobb and would 
join her in heaven to be judged again 
the judge said his assessment of duncans guilt stemmed from 
videotaped interrogations during which duncan initially denied any 
knowledge of the oct 11 slaying but later conceded he discovered 
miss cobbs body 
norton said duncan was convicted out of his own mouth 
duncan told investigators that he and miss cobb 31 bought the 
insurance policies while planning to be married 
the slain troopers body was found oct 12 seated in her patrol 
car behind a rural church her service revolver ticket book and 
keys were missing and have never been located 
the judge rejected the jurys recommendation by a 102 vote 
last month that duncan be given a sentence of life in prison 
without parole the jury had found duncan guilty of two counts of 
capital murder earlier in the month

seattle water officials say drought controls 
enacted last summer have been ended due to recent spring storms 
that have restored the citys water supplies 
the reservoirs are above normal and 90 percent full and 
mountain snowpack will bring them up to capacity by june officials 
predicted in announcing the end of the drought emergency on tuesday 
however seattle residents were asked to continue to limit lawn 
watering to every third day and to practice other conservation 
techniques 
last year the water department was faced with the worst water 
shortage in its history as a result of a prolonged dry spell 
special pumps had to be installed in reservoirs and most outdoor 
uses of watering were restricted 
other parts of the state remain dry and water shortages are 
expected this summer in some areas east of the cascade mountains 
meanwhile firefighters in southcentral oregon battled a 
60acre blaze as other crews began mopping up another fire that 
charred 35 acres in the siskiyou mountains 
a series of fires has prompted forestry officials to consider

the city of seattle has agreed to pay 50 million 
to washington public power supply system bondholders left holding 
225 billion in debt after the system abandoned two nuclear power 
plants and defaulted 
junius hoffman a courtappointed special master overseeing 
negotiations to settle lawsuits in the case announced the 
agreement tuesday the tentative settlement has to be approved by 
the federal court handling the securitiesfraud litigation 
the city is the fourth party to settle in the case which 
stemmed from the largest default in the history of the municipal 
bond market the two plants were abandoned six years ago following 
cost overruns and studies indicating the power from the plants 
would not be needed 
the city of seattle was not among the 88 utilities that 
participated in constructing the plants wppss nos 4 and 5 
however hoffman noted the city was a member of the supply system 
and designated individuals who served on the wppss board of 
directors and its executive board at the time the bonds for the two 
projects were issued 
the agreement was worked out between attorneys for class 
plaintiffs people who have a fraud claim against the defendants 
and chemical bank which represents bondholders on one side and 
lawyers for the city and its insurance carriers on the other 
doug jewett seattle city attorney said the city would pay 68 
million while its insurance carriers would pay 438 million 
we think it is a good settlement for the city because the 
dollar amount is less than would have been spent on defense 
costs alone those costs have been running 25 million a year 
jewett said 
of even more concern to the city of seattle was its risk as 
being a defendant in a case where the plaintiffs are seeking 225 
billion plus interest 
with the settlement of the underwriters we had become the 
deepest pocket in the lawsuit jewett said we are breathing 
easier tonight now that that exposure has been removed 
jim irwin an attorney with the seattle law firm of shidle 
mcbroom gates amp lucas who represented bondholders said we 
think it is a fair and reasonable settlement and we are pleased 
the tentative settlements still need approval by us district 
judge william browning of tucson ariz who is presiding over the 
fraud case and appointed hoffman a university of arizona law 
professor as special master 
all together the four settlements reached so far would mean 
payments of about 156 million to plaintiffs irwin said 
the chief remaining defendants include the supply system and 
utilities that participated in constructing the plants 
trial in the case is set to begin sept 7 in tucson and could 
last as long as two years 
the supply system attempted to build five nuclear plants in all 
during the 1970s one plant is operating two have been mothballed 
and two were abandoned

no state charges will be filed against a 
control tower operator who caused an amtrak crash that injured 25 
people because authorities cannot prove drugs were involved a 
prosecutor said today 
traces of marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine were found in 
blood and urine samples taken from the control tower operator tom 
connor more than 72 hours after the jan 29 wreck in which a 
passenger train struck a work vehicle district attorney william 
ryan said 
however his usage of these controlled substances cannot be 
related back to the time of the accident and there is no evidence 
that connor was impaired by or under the influence of drugs at the 
time of the accident ryan said at a news conference 
connor could have been charged with counts of recklessly 
endangering another person ryan said but prosecutors concluded 
they could not prove the druguse relationship needed for a 
conviction 
connor said he forgot to switch the amtrak night owl from the 
track occupied by the work vehicle but he denied being under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol at the time according to 
investigators the train was bound from washington to boston 
connor who fled his post at nearby marcus hook immediately 
after the accident told national transportation safety board 
officials that he blamed himself according to investigators he 
said he panicked when he saw the wreckage fearing the two men on 
the work vehicle had been killed 
connor did not emerge from hiding until three days after the 
accident he then spoke with investigators and underwent drug tests 
ryan said he will ask state lawmakers to introduce legislation 
that would make it a crime for railroad operators to leave the 
scene of an accident us rep curt weldon a republican who 
represents the area introduced similar legislation in congress 
ryan said 
connor 30 quit his job in february before an amtrak hearing on 
the accident

a british airways jet with 119 people aboard had 
to veer off a taxiway into mud to avoid being hit by another jet 
that landed on the wrong runway at gatwick airport authorities 
said today 
the incoming jet a british island airways aircraft carrying 117 
people landed on the taxiway instead of the parallel runway it was 
supposed to use the civil aviation authority said 
the airports main runway was closed for repaving and pilots 
were directed to use alternative runways 
the landing jet threw its engines into reverse and screeched to 
a stop about 750 feet short of crashing into the other jet said an 
aviation authority spokesman 
he said the incident occurred at 1020 pm 520 pm edt 
there were no injuries 
airport duty manager ian maccorquodale said the pilot of a 
british airways boeing 737 was taxiing toward a runway for takeoff 
when air traffic controllers ordered it to take evasive action to 
avoid being hit by the british island airways bac 111 
he said the british airways jet swung to one side and came to a 
stop with its wheels stuck in the mud and grass beside the runway 
british airways said its plane was traveling slowly when it 
took the evasive action 
maccorquodale said the closure of the main runway shouldnt have 
contributed to the near disaster but the 1300strong guild of air 
pilots and air navigators disagreed 
the worry lies in the fact that the british airports authority 
are digging up the main runway at one of the busiest times of the 
year said the organizations clerk capt paul wilson 
freddie yetman technical secretary of the british airline 
pilots association said possibly the emergency runway was not 
as well lit as the main runway would have been but its up to 
pilots to be very very careful when there is a change in landing 
procedures 
airport officials praised the controller who diverted the 
british airways jet an airport spokesman said the controller 
prevented an incident from becoming an accident 
he also commended the ba pilot for responding quickly and 
positively 
gatwick airport 25 miles south of london was closed for 20 
minutes while the british airways jet was towed away it was not 
damaged 
next to londons heathrow airport gatwick is the worlds second 
busiest airport in terms of international passengers 
the bac111 was arriving from venice italy and the british 
airways jet was destined for the greek island of rhodes 
british island airways and the civil aviation authority were 
investigating the incident and the airline said it took its flight 
crew off duty while the investigation was going on 
the air traffic control center in west london and the civil 
aviation authority said they are also investigating a near 
collision monday involving a military jet and a civilian helicopter 
the helicopter owned by dollar air services was doing pipeline

two family service workers fired for failing to 
do their jobs properly have been indicted on misconduct charges in 
connection with the murders of two babies whose homes they were 
assigned to investigate 
a cook county grand jury handed up the indictments tuesday 
against hattie roland 37 and diane henton 35 former employees 
of the department of children and family services 
the indictments said states attorney richard m daley should 
serve as a notice to other caseworkers that were going to be 
looking at those records in order to protect all the children of 
this county 
the two women worked in an office in which as many as eight 
caseworkers had to be disciplined said gordon johnson director of 
the department 
i think we should have done a better job of administering that 
office he said im not sure it would have saved the children 
but i would have been satisfied that we had done everything 
possible 
we transferred terminated and suspended seven or eight 
people he added 
ms roland and ms henton were fired by the agency last year 
after an internal investigation 
ms roland was indicted on 63 counts of misconduct on grounds of 
allegedly failing to file adequate reports falsifying reports and 
failing to provide child protection services said lisa howard a 
spokeswoman for daleys office 
she is accused of lying about her visits to check on debra 
hardy a chicagoarea mother who was convicted of strangling her 
4monthold son ms howard said 
according to the indictment ms roland said she had been in the 
hardy home on nine separate dates between feb 21 1983 and june 
21 1984 when in fact she had never set foot in the house 
ms hardy was convicted of murder and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison 
ms henton who also supervised other caseworkers was charged 
with failing to report the abuse of jonathan campbell who was 
killed jan 25 1986 on his first birthday 
anthony habener a friend of the childs mother was convicted 
of murder and sentenced to 65 years in prison 
ms howard said ms henton visited the home on jan 16 eight 
days before jonathan was killed and closed the case two days later 
an autopsy report showed the childs ears were nearly torn off 
and that he had 25 or more bruises on his body many at least 10 
days old 
ms howard said the women face up to five years on each count of 
misconduct if convicted of the charges 
ms roland appealed her firing to civil service officials who 
overturned the department ruling johnson said but has not 
returned to work pending the outcome of the indictments

evacuations because most residents of homes near the well were at

princess caroline responded of course im very sad for the 
florida chicken producers now that i know its not a florida 
chicken i certainly wont touch it 
many people believe a freerange chicken tastes better than one 
grown in a controlled atmosphere because it is a happier chicken 
that is allowed to exercise and eat whatever it wants said 
florida poultry federation spokeswoman valinda parsons 
but womble doesnt believe a happier chicken is necessarily a 
tastier chicken 
chickens that roam free will eat anything they can get their 
beaks on and sometimes that means dirt or manure said womble

april 10 
the el paso texas times on the income tax deadline 
why is midnight april 15 the deadline for all income tax 
returns 
remember the waits for state drivers licenses and vehicle 
plates when every driver was required to get them by the same date 
then someone proposed renewing licenses in the month of the 
drivers birthday and plates in the month of the vehicles original 
purchase 
why cant that be done for income tax returns congress and the 
internal revenue service have made april 15 into national trauma 
day 
the us postal service is overloaded and overtime must be paid 
to handle the crush of lastminute returns 
then too because of the single deadline the irs has hired 
thousands of temporary workers many of whom are giving faulty 
answers to taxpayers 
april 15 is a day dreaded by millions of people in this country 
it should not be it would not be if the irs and congress would 
figure out how to divide the taxpayers by 12 and make it a 
yearround operation

evening express portland maine on john zaccaro jrs cocaine 
conviction 
it was perhaps a typical mothers response to a sons 
conviction on drug charges she blamed herself the police and 
prosecutors 
but this typical mother just happened to be a former 
assistant district attorney member of congress and vice 
presidential nominee geraldine ferraro 
at a news conference outside the vermont district court in 
rutland following her son john zaccaro jrs conviction for cocaine 
peddling ferraro did fault her son for drug possession but at 
the same time blamed my candidacy for making my son a target 
she hinted that vermont police set up her son because of her 
role as the democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 
finally ferraro aimed her bitterest remarks at state prosecutor 
john quinn for rejecting a plea bargain arrangement 
ferraros defensiveness about her sons drugpushing may be 
understandable in a loyal parent 
but for someone who has served both as a lawmaker and a law 
enforcer her attempts to pin the blame on others had a hollow and 
selfserving ring

richard nixon is at least consistent he still believes that 
the presidency is an elected monarchy and all the presidents 
vassals should be pardoned from any crimes committed in service to 
him 
if president reagan pardons john m poindexter and oliver l 
north he says to the country i am the president i am above the 
law and these men acting on what they thought were my directives 
are above the law also 
its unfortunate that nixon learned so little from his forced 
resignation in 1974 
almost 14 years after his departure from the oval office nixon 
should understand by now the reason behind his fall from grace

the baltimore sun on trade tradeoffs 
the trade bill sluicing through congress can be fairly compared 
to raw sewage passing through a water treatment plant 
at midstage in the process it is a good deal cleaner than when 
it went in but unless it is subjected to a lot more filtration it 
will not be fit for the law books 
what president reagan must guard against is the natural 
inclination of republican lawmakers to do something about 
massive trade deficits lest they be clobbered by democrats 
preaching economic nationalism 
as it stands now reagan should veto the trade bill it dilutes 
presidential authority by passing critical decisions affecting 
relations with other nations to a cabinetlevel trade 
representative who could be badgered by congress 
and its disclosure provisions could scare off foreign investors 
whose funds are needed to finance huge reaganera federal debts and 
deficits

sentenced in spain to six years and one day in prison plus an 
18083 fine on a drugtrafficking charge 
the photographer who has been held without bail since he was 
arrested a year ago says he is innocent that he thought the 
suitcase he was transporting for a washington dc travel agency 
on a fourday assignment requiring a flight from chile to spain was 
filled with travel brochures not cocaine 
even if he were only an unwitting drug courier the 
freelancers story underscores a message that the us state 
department says american tourists should take to heart travel 
abroad warrants caution 
in many countries people caught with drugs in their possession 
no matter how small the amount can be assured of one thing hefty 
penalties that will make them think two or three times before 
trying that again when they finally get out that is 
that is something this country should be emulating

the chattanooga tenn times on air traffic controllers 
the house vote to require the reagan administration to rehire at 
least 1000 of the 11400 air traffic controllers president reagan 
fired in 1981 presents the administration with a crucial decision 
should the safety of the nations air traffic control system have a 
higher priority than the labor dispute that prompted the firings 
common sense says yes 
the system is still operating with fewer controllers now than in 
1981 roughly 15500 compared with 16375 moreover fewer of the 
controllers now working are at the full performance level of 
the most experienced and proficient controllers working in 1981 
meanwhile there have been major increases in air traffic the 
federal aviation administration argues that safety is not being 
compromised and that it is adding more controllers into the system 
gradually 
the controllers were wrong to strike in violation of the law 
but thats no reason for the government to put the air traffic 
system at risk by refusing to approve this bill

ballesteros 
we doubt if many people were disturbed by the report of how 
american drug agents used subterfuge and foreign police to arrest 
an alleged international cocaine czar and bring him back to the 
united states for trial 
as a matter of fact there are probably a lot of folks 
applauding the federal drug agents ability to get their hands on a 
major drug suspect in honduras juan ramon matta ballesteros 
defense lawyers and civil libertarians may throw up their arms 
in dismay but the us courts agree with the opinion of most folks 
how defendants got to the united states is not a legal concern if 
no us laws were broken 
the practice of getting suspects from beyond our borders will 
not prevent criminals from going about their business but it sends 
a message that the long arm of uncle sam can extend into foreign 
countries

the orlando fla sentinel on the plight of the homeless 
often the first step toward solving a problem is to achieve a 
consensus on how serious it is thats why its encouraging to 
learn from a new poll that 90 percent of americans think the plight 
of the homeless is a national disgrace 
the people interviewed also are concerned about the need to 
rehabilitate lowincome housing and provide down payment loans for 
young families who cant buy homes without them 
in fact more than 60 percent of people questioned by the 
national housing institute said they would be willing to pay 120 a 
year in additional taxes if it would help solve our housing 
problems 
enthusiasm for additional taxes tends to wane when hypothesis 
turns to reality but institute officials estimate an average tax 
increase of that size would bring in between 12 billion and 17 
billion a year 
that would about double the shamefully little money the federal 
government is putting into housing programs now

between players one player even threw a chair at a fan 
in a welcome attempt to restrain the mayhem new rules have been 
adopted by the national collegiate athletic association 
with the new ncaa rules a uniform system of discipline has been 
introduced into the game 
nevertheless violence is as out of place in basketball as are

vicksburg miss evening post on the need to curb use of 
chemical weapons 
the altogether convincing evidence of hideous mass deaths 
indicts iraq once again for using chemical weapons in its war 
against iran 
incredibily iraq also committed a monstrous crime against 
hundreds of its own people kurdish iraqi civilians in order to 
use poison gas against iranian troops occupying an iraqi frontline 
village halabaja 
international horror over chemical warfare during world war i 
led to the 1925 geneva protocol which banned the use of what 
winston churchill called a hellish poison 
the dangerous turn in the iraniraq war confirms the need for a 
new international agreement that restates the prohibition against 
chemical weapons destroys existing stockpiles and provides a 
credible international punishment for those who violate it 
meanwhile washington and moscow should join in making it clear 
to the persian gulf combatants that the use of chemical warfare 
will result in joint economic and military sanctions

obstruction of justice and misuse of state funds they were 
charges though of the sort that could be explained away and 
probably are in hundreds of instances 
true a third charge of concealing a 350000 campaign loan was 
dismissed by the arizona senate because mecham faces a criminal

but the plain fact is that mecham made america ridicule arizona

from being a sticking point when gorbachev and president reagan 
meet in moscow may 29 to talk about reducing strategic nuclear arms 
but the soviet troop withdrawal to begin may 15 will likely be 
followed by more bitter fighting and possibly efforts to partition

the sun westerly ri on trucks with idling engines 
anyone who has paused at a truck stop along the highways knows 
the sound of parked behemoths there they stand sometimes 20 or so 
giants muttering softly as their diesel engines are left idling 
while the truckers go in for a coffee or a meal 
there are reasons for this practice the idling engines keep the 
truck cab cool and warm according to the season and may also be 
used to keep fuel warm for a ready departure 
but argonne national laboratory researchers have taken some of 
the fun out of it a study reportedly shows that an hour of idling 
causes as much engine wear as two hours of driving the bad effects 
are cumulative 
the director of argonnes center for transportation research 
offers this formulation the average truck is left idling some 800 
hours a year equivalent to 64000 miles on the road and that 
requires an engine overall about a year sooner than would otherwise 
be necessary

reagan greeted lee at the white house for a 90minute meeting 
and lunch which both sides indicated would cover a wide range of 
issues including eastwest relations 
lee does not want ussoviet summitry and superpower accords on 
arms control and a soviet withdrawal from afghanistan to overshadow 
the unsolved problem of cambodia said spoke only on condition of 
anonymity 
moscowbacked vietnamese troops have occupied much of cambodia 
since 1978 the year after the red army entered afghanistan 
lee already has conveyed his concerns to us officials during 
two days of talks that included meetings with reagans national 
security adviser colin l powell and secretary of state george p 
shultz 
lee was quoted by the aide as telling shultz that if the soviet 
union can withdraw from afghanistan there is no reason the 
vietnamese cannot pull out of cambodia 
shultz briefed lee about the afghanistan withdrawal accords 
which the united states will endorse in geneva on thursday and the 
two men also discussed the justbegun negotiations about the lease 
of us bases in the philippines 
singapore would like to see a favorable outcome from the 
negotiations in order to ensure a continued us commitment to the 
region to counter a growing soviet presence

massachusetts will pay the federal government 24 
million for polluting boston harbor in a settlement reached after 
years of negotiations a top state official said today 
the agreement marks a departure because 2 million of the total 
will go to a special boston harbor cleanup fund according to 
william geary who heads the metropolitan district commission 
of the total amount 425000 will be paid as a fine to the us 
treasury geary said 
the settlement stems from a lawsuit that began in the mid1980s 
when environmentalists and lawyers representing the city of quincy 
sued the district commission for polluting the harbor the 
commission has wide authority over public services in the 
metropolitan area 
as part of the case the state created the massachusetts water 
resources authority which took control of the harbor cleanup effort 
and was granted power to bill sewer and water service customers 
but negotiations between the state and the us environmental 
protection agency continued over damages for pollution of boston 
harbor which state and federal officials say is the dirtiest in 
the nation 
fortunately the commonwealth and the epa have come to terms 
with establishing a vision for the future in which we clean up the 
harbor rather than dwelling on the past of how it got polluted 
geary said the agreement closes that sad chapter 
geary said 2 million of the money would go into a special 
harbor trust to benefit harborrelated projects such as beach 
restoration and protection of wildlife

a jury has acquitted a man who shot up 
the offices of the anchorage times of attempted murder finding he 
didnt intend to kill anyone but convicted him of attempted 
kidnapping and other charges 
the defendant donald ramsey was upset with publisher bob 
atwood because the times refused to print a political advertisement 
attacking sen frank murkowski ralaska in october 1986 the 
prosecution said 
ramsey stormed the newspaper office threw a smoke grenade and 
confronted atwood and his daughter elaine the atwoods subdued 
ramsey and no one was injured seriously although numerous shots 
were fired 
atwood and several other people from the times listened 
impassively from the back of the courtroom as the verdicts were 
announced tuesday afternoon atwood 81 said later he just wanted 
to make sure ramsey stayed in jail for awhile 
my only concern has been if they found him not guilty and 
turned him loose he said what position does that leave me in 
what are my options with him running around loose 
in addition to attempted kidnapping the jury convicted ramsey 
of thirddegree assault and reckless endangerment 
in statements to investigators ramsey expressed great animosity 
to atwood he said he believed the publisher and other political 
figures were conspiring against him and were responsible for a fire 
that destroyed his apartment 
defense attorney craig howard described ramsey as a naive 
political activist who just snapped when he found he couldnt 
right wrongs by simply pointing them out to public officials 
the attempted kidnapping conviction carries a recommended 
sevenyear prison term but assistant district attorney valerie van 
brocklin said she might argue that ramsey should get more because 
of the unusually serious nature of his actions 
howard said he expected superior court judge mark rowland would 
give ramsey a substantial sentence with lots of probation time 
tacked on

dukakis said the united states must be prepared to use nuclear 
force in the event of a soviet invasion of europe that could not 
be halted with conventional forces according to a newspaper report 
published today 
dukakis said he could conceive of a scenario using nuclear 
weapons against the soviets in europe 
i dont think its going to happen he said in a meeting 
with new york daily news reporters and editors but he added 
weve got to be prepared to use nuclear force obviously with 
great restraint only when there seems to be no other alternative 
dukakis statement drew criticism from rival albert gore jr 
that it was unwise and irresponsible gore said the comments 
indicated the massachusetts governors lack of foreign policy 
experience 
but dukakis spokesman leslie dach disputed gore saying today 
that al gore read the morning newspapers and started shooting 
and once again he got his facts wrong experienced leaders dont do 
that they check their facts before they act 
dukakis also said he would order in the military if communist 
forces crossed the west german border or the 38th parallel in korea 
dukakis was back in boston today attending to state business as 
governor of massachusetts taking a break for part of the day from 
the campaign for new yorks important democratic presidential 
primary one week away 
vying with gore for the support of jews who make up close to 
onefourth the democratic voters in new york dukakis met privately 
with orthodox and hasidic jewish leaders in brooklyn on tuesday he 
emerged to address a large rally with people filling a city street 
and received the strong endorsement of rabbi morris shmidman and 
the areas congressman rep stephen solarz 
shmidman is executive director of th council of jewish 
organizations a group representing 190 different jewish 
organizations 
i know in my heart michael dukakis is the best choice and i 
will vote for him the rabbi said i urge you my friends to 
follow me 
dukakis praised the jewish community warmly and drew analogies 
with his own heritage as the son of greek immigrants but he did 
not directly respond if he heard them to the repeated shouts from 
some young people in the crowd pressing him for more detailed 
answers on support for israel and to draw distinctions with 
jackson a candidate who has stirred strong opposition among some 
jewish leaders for past statements and associations 
i have some disagreements with rev jackson dukakis said 
i have some disagreements with sen gore im going to run a 
strong campaign that puts my best foot forward in the hope i 
can win the support of the people of new york 
dukakis met a day earlier with other jewish leaders following 
by more than a week a similar appearance by gore in which he struck 
a strongly proisrael stance that has won him some support among 
jewish leaders meeting in a debate earlier in the day gore 
suggested dukakis had shown enthusiasm for creation of a 
palestinian state a move opposed by some jewish leaders and which 
shmidman called a dagger at the heart and soul of israel 
responding to reporters surrounded by those at the rally 
dukakis said that israel must exercise maximum restraint in 
dealing with palestinian unrest in the west bank and gaza 
some in the crowd shouted to dukakis what about jackson 
afterward some in the crowd voiced only qualified support 
he was very vague in regard to israel said daniel cohen a 
hebrew teacher i find him very hazy 
yet several also voiced a concern often heard here that a vote 
for gore would in effect help jackson in what is regarded as a 
twoway race for the lead in new york with dukakis 
there is a fear of jackson cohen said 
dukakis later campaigned at a rally with new york women 
repeating his commitment to providing basic health insurance for 
all americans he was praised by a colleague vermont gov 
madeleine kunin who called him a candidate who not only gives 
you rhetoric but gives you a record

seven major us companies said wednesday theyve 
joined forces with the soviets to produce everything from crackers 
to computer disks in a consortium that will market capitalist 
products in a socialist economy 
in addition us industrialist armand hammer announced a joint 
venture under which he will build two plastics factories in the 
ukraine 
us commerce secretary c william verity and a group of about 
400 american business leaders are in moscow this week for meetings 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and other officials about 
the possibility of expanding trade between the superpowers 
several agreements have been announced already and the 
businessmen say the climate for broader cooperation has warmed 
considerably in recent months 
james h giffen president of the new american trade consortium 
involving the seven companies said this weeks activity could lead 
to an unprecedented volume of ussoviet trade 
giffen who also is president of the mercator corp attributed 
the trade successes to the improved political atmosphere 
following soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs visit to the united 
states in december 
both governments began campaigning for expansion of commercial 
ties after the washington summit the businessmen said 
the soviets are actively seeking joint business projects with 
capitalist countries to help improve the quantity and quality of 
consumer goods and to earn convertible foreign currencies to pay 
for grain and other imports 
few us companies had been able to put together joint ventures 
while there is huge demand among soviets for consumer goods and 
services they have only rubles to spend which cannot be converted 
by the western businesses seeking to take home their profits 
but on monday honeywell inc announced a joint venture to 
supply automated production controls for soviet fertilizer 
factories and on tuesday roma food enterprises of piscataway 
nj began selling pizza in moscow from a mobile van 
hammers 200 million plastics plant deal was the second joint 
venture he has announced recently and the companies forming the 
new consortium claim their efforts will result in a network of 
projects to make goods for both soviet and foreign markets 
this is not aid this is trade said giffen what were 
after is profit 
no jointventure agreements have been completed by the 
consortium yet and giffen declined to say how much they expect the 
trade volume to be worth once the individual deals are put into 
writing 
rjr nabisco vice chairman robert j carbonell said his company 
is negotiating with the kremlin to produce cookies and crackers 
breakfast cereals and cigarettes in the soviet union and ford 
motor company vice president alexander j trotman said his company 
is talking about producing cars light trucks and parts at soviet 
plants 
by forming a consortium the businesses are effectively matching 
the soviet bureaucracy which groups various government industries 
and agencies together to put together joint ventures with foreign 
firms but the consortium arrangement also gives the companies more 
flexibility in financing their projects 
because soviet rubles are not convertible foreign companies 
entering into ventures with the soviets have to devise ways of 
either earning hard currency or taking their share of the proceeds 
out in soviet commodities 
giffen confirmed that by pooling the individual joint ventures 
under one umbrella some of the deals could produce goods solely 
for the soviet market but take out hardcurrency profits from the 
export sales of the other companies 
he declined to give details of the financing arrangements until 
the joint ventures are signed 
there are difficulties for american and other western 
countries to interface with planned economy countries giffen 
said what weve tried to set up is a mechanism that will allow 
them to interface 
complex regulations on joint ventures were introduced by the 
soviets last year and revised several times but most western 
businesses that have signed jointventure agreements have 
negotiated separate unique deals that allow them to repatriate 
their profits 
the new jersey pizza company plans to use its ruble income to 
buy commodities like mushrooms that it can use or sell abroad 
hammer who has had business dealings with the kremlin since the 
1920s told reporters hes convinced the soviet union is 
committed to making joint ventures succeed 
he said the two plastics plants his occidental petroleum corp 
will have in operation by 1991 would help improve the supply of 
consumer goods to the soviet public 
if socialism is to succeed in russia you must improve the 
standard of living of your people hammer told alexander 
ustkachkinzev first deputy minister of the soviet chemical 
industry after signing the agreement 
hammer announced in november that occidental petroleum italian 
and japanese companies would participate in another joint venture 
to build a petrochemical complex near the caspian sea 
other projects in the negotiation stage under the consortium 
include an eastman kodak co plan to help the soviets produce 
clinical chemicals for blood analysis and manufacture of magnetic 
computer products 
william d dearstyne of johnson and johnson said talks are under 
way with his company on projects that would have soviets producing 
their brandname pharmaceuticals personal care items and 
disposable hospital products 
the other companies taking part in the consortium are chevron 
overseas petroleum inc which has been talking with the soviet 
ministries overseeing geology and oil production and archer 
daniels midland co looking into commodity production 
opportunities

to reopen suspended talks on a disputed himalayan glacier

industrialist jon huntsman abruptly 
dropped his frontrunning quest for the republican gubernatorial 
nomination today citing business reasons and a need for party 
unity 
huntsmans decision came one day before he was to formally 
announce his candidacy for governor and 30 days after he had said 
he was seeking to wrest the partys nomination from gov norm 
bangerter 
the building of our economy is and will be far more important 
to me than the actual title of governor huntsman said in a brief 
statement at huntsman chemical corp headquarters he said a recent 
business trip to asia presented unexpected opportunities to expand 
his 1 billionperyear chemicals empire 
without specifically naming taxcutting independent 
gubernatorial candidate merrill cook a republican huntsman called 
on independents to unite behind bangerter 
huntsman had already shocked republicans once with his 
announcement last month that he would challenge bangerter who was 
trailing democratic challenger ted wilson in polls for the gop 
nomination 
a longtime player behind the scenes in the state republican 
party huntsman quickly gathered major support for his candidacy 
from major party figures and launched a 236000 television and 
radio campaign on saturday 
without specifically naming taxcutting independent 
gubernatorial candidate merrill cook a republican huntsman called 
on independents to unite behind bangerter 
bangerter who also attended the news conference said there 
were no conditions set by either man for the withdrawal bangerter 
said he would draw heavily on huntsmans expertise to bolster the 
states economic development 
huntsman supporters certainly have nothing to be ashamed of 
and have nothing to fear from norm bangerter the governor said 
huntsmans decision came three days after a poll in the salt 
lake tribune showed the challenger had widened his lead over the 
firstterm governor the poll by bardsley hardison amp neidhart 
found huntsman with a 48 percent to 40 percent lead although the 
telephone survey had an error margin of 7 percent 
wilson the former mayor of salt lake city said it was 
difficult to assess the impact of huntsmans decision 
however he said were encouraged we think this does help 
our chances it allows us to go out and take full command of the 
jobs issue 
huntsman 50 former presidential aide and founder of a 
chemicals empire with annual sales of 1 billion had personally 
loaned his campaign 100000 while awaiting arrival of some 
200000 in pledges made the day after his march 15 announcement 
the 30day campaign was huntsmans first quest for public 
office but he has been a force in the state gop for more than a 
decade his fundraising skills personal wealth and washingtn 
connections left a number of republicans in his debt 
he is presently utah finance chairman for vice president george 
bushs presidential campaign 
in 1980 the gop nomination to challenge popular democratic gov 
scott matheson was virtually assured huntsman but he declined 
saying a campaign would not allow him enough time with his wife and 
nine children 
his transformation from supporter to opponent was a bitter blow 
to bangerter who scored huntsman for a lack of loyalty bangerter 
was deserted by several people who withdrew endorsements and 
switched to huntsman 
for 12 months during 1971 and 1972 huntsman served as a special 
assistant to president richard nixon 
a graduate of the wharton school of finance at the university of 
pennsylvania huntsman founded huntsman container corp in 1970 
huntsman container focused on food packaging and the firms 
accomplishments included the invention of a styrofoam container for 
big mac hamburgers 
in 1982 he formed huntsman chemical corp the companys major 
product is bulk polystyrene and other plastics derived from 
petroleum byproducts

retail sales rose a healthy 08 percent in 
march the government reported wednesday propelled by easter 
buying at department and food stores 
the commerce department said retail sales for the month 
increased by a seasonally adjusted 11 billion to 1307 billion 
it was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest 
since december when sales shot up 11 percent revised figures 
showed sales rose 06 percent in february and 01 percent in 
january 
ever since the october stock market crash economists have 
watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer sector of 
the economy would weaken but more recently some analysts have 
raised fears that too much consumer demand could rekindle inflation 
if consumer spending were sustained at the march pace for 
several months to come we would probably be heading toward 
higher inflation and higher interest rates said bruce steinberg 
senior economist with merrill lynch capital markets however he 
said growth in retail spending will likely slacken in april and may 
the consumer was feeling good about spending in march but 
that doesnt indicate that a new consumer boom is in the making 
steinberg said 
economists had predicted only a 02 percent to 03 percent gain 
in march they said wednesday that because easter fell on april 3 
earlier in the year than usual more people may have shopped for 
the holiday in march than normally 
sales at department and other general merchandise stores rose 
16 percent after suffering a steep 26 percent drop in february 
sales at food stores rose 11 percent following a 06 percent 
decline the month before 
the increase at department stores is definitely 
easterrelated said james newton an economist with economic 
perspectives inc a delaware ohio consulting firm he said the 
increase at food stores might also be a bit easterrelated 
march sales increased in all categories execept furniture and 
restaurants in contrast to the first two months of the year when 
overall sales growth was spurred by auto sales 
the strength in retail sales had been largely in autos said 
scott hoyt an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm now were seeing it across the board 
indicating somewhat broader strength 
auto sales rose 09 percent in march excluding autos sales 
were up 08 percent the same as the overall rise 
in february and january car sales were much stronger than other 
sales they rose 2 percent and 25 percent respectively while 
other sales increased only 02 percent in february and declined 06 
percent in january 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last three or 
more years were up 05 percent in march while nondurable goods 
were up 1 percent 
the department offered these details of march sales 
hardware and garden supply stores up 05 percent after soaring 
30 percent in february 
furniture and appliance stores down 2 percent after a strong 
29 percent increase a month earlier 
gasoline up 14 percent following a 12 percent decline 
specialty clothing stores up 03 percent restaurants and 
bars down 06 percent and drug stores up 16 percent

new york gov mario cuomo heaped praise on 
jesse jackson today as a singularly important democrat who 
could win for the party in november jackson thanked cuomo for not 
endorsing any of the presidential candidates 
he is making this race a manifestation of the american idea at 
its very best said cuomo during a late morning news conference 
with jackson 
while cuomo held to his pledge not to endorse any of the three 
democratic candidates before the end of the primary season on june 
7 jackson said that was fine with him 
governor cuomo just keep a freeze on all endorsements and 
keep extending your support the candidate told the new york 
governor as jackson supporters cheered 
jackson met with cuomo for about a half hour this morning 
following a speech at a 100 per person breakfast fundraiser for 
about 200 people in albany 
in his introduction of jackson cuomo said the candidate was 
suffering from the dumb blonde syndrome in which potential 
voters think that if a candidate demonstrates charisma and passion 
there is little else nothing could be further from the truth 
cuomo said of jackson cuomo an eloquent political speaker has 
said he suffers from the same putdown 
cuomo told jackson that the fact you can get to be president 
or so close that they put your face on the front page of national 
magazines just to explain this phenomenon that is extraordinary 
progress 
for his part jackson said he felt it was a wise use of 
power for cuomo to hold off backing any candidate until after the 
primaries jackson said the move would encourage more people to 
vote

a man who says he prayed to a saint for help in 
picking the winning numbers on a lotto ticket has won a sevenyear 
legal battle for half of the 28 million prize 
christopher pando 24 said he and the tickets holder daysi 
fernandez had agreed to split any winnings and a jury decided 
tuesday after a sevenday trial that he was telling the truth 
i believed in justice and i finally got it said pando who 
is unemployed 
pando is entitled to 14 million plus a couple hundred 
thousand dollars interest that has accumulated on the money since 
it was placed in escrow said his lawyer joseph ettinger 
pando testified that he prayed to st elegua who told him which 
numbers to play on four lotto tickets he bought for ms fernandez 
in june 1981 
one of the tickets won at the time the 28 million prize 
paid in annual installments over 10 years was the staterun games 
biggest payout 
initially justice edward greenfield dismissed the case saying 
it could not be proved that st elegua had given pando the numbers 
but the judge was reversed on appeal with the higher court saying 
that this was not the issue that it was whether pando and ms 
fernandez had an oral agreement 
ms fernandez 44 a mother of three who had been on welfare 
about 10 years when she won said they never had such a deal 
in the five years after she won ms fernandez collected about 
half of the prize at about 267720 a year in july 1986 pando won 
a court order stopping further payments until the case was 
resolved she will receive any money remaining from her half of the 
prize 
when the verdict was announced ms fernandez wept ettinger 
said

albert gore jr today accused fellow democratic candidate 
michael dukakis of making unwise and irresponsible comments 
about a us nuclear strike against the soviet union dukakis 
spokesman called gores remarks a desperate move 
rival jesse jackson met with new york gov mario cuomo who 
declined to endorse him but did say he was a singularly important 
democrat who could win for the party in november 
jackson who appeared with cuomo at a news conference in albany 
ny said governor cuomo just keep a freeze on all 
endorsements and keep extending your support 
on the republican side vice president george bush was winding 
up an easydoesit campaign swing in new york 
all three of the remaining major democratic presidential 
candidates were campaigning in the state six days before its big 
primary with 255 national convention delegates at stake 
massachusetts gov dukakis in an interview published in todays 
new york daily news said he could envision using nuclear weapons 
if the soviets invaded europe and conventional weapons failed to 
stop them 
i dont think its going to happen he said but weve got 
to be prepared to use nuclear force obviously with great 
restraint only when there seems to be no other alternative 
gore at a breakfast with corporate executives on long island 
characterized dukakis comments as saying he would launch a 
nuclear first strike against the soviet union if they invaded 
europe with conventional forces 
he said presidents and candidates for the office traditionally 
have avoided the trap of spelling out in advance when the united 
states of america would use the awesome power contained in our 
nuclear arsenal 
later to reporters gore said governor dukakis made a 
significant mistake thats unwise and irresponsible 
dukakis communications director leslie dach said in an 
interview today al gore read the morning newspapers and started 
shooting and once again he got his facts wrong experienced 
leaders dont do that they check their facts before they act al 
gores action today is a desperate move for a candidate and a 
dangerous move for a president 
gore also criticized jackson for what he said was jacksons 
comment several years ago that he would unilaterally halt 
deployment of missiles in europe 
the three democrats met tuesday in the first of four debates 
preceding next tuesdays new york primary bush meanwhile threw 
out the ball at the start of a new york mets baseball game and 
talked of campaigning against the ghost of jimmy carter 
the debate featured several sharp exchanges between dukakis the 
democratic frontrunner and gore the tennessee senator who needs 
a strong new york showing to revive his candidacy 
at one point gore declared that dukakis had sounded a note of 
enthusiasm about an independent palestinian state gore also 
criticized jackson on the same issue saying he disagreed with 
the way jesse jackson advocates a palestinian state 
dukakis retorted that gore was just plain wrong i didnt 
express enthusiasm for a palestinian state yesterday he said 
for his part jackson did not back down from his support for a 
palestinian homeland while we can guarantee secure borders we 
cannot ensure tranquility so long as there is occupation 
gore and dukakis have been courting jewish voters while jackson 
has been trying to mend fences with them they traditionally make 
up a quarter of the turnout in new york democratic primaries 
on tuesday in the ap delegate count dukakis had 75015 votes 
jackson 7131 gore 3968 and uncommitted 5067 
bush rubbed elbows with the rich and famous attending a 
1000aplate fundraiser in new york city put on by wealthy 
developer donald trump bush also struck a presidential pose by 
tossing out the first baseball at a mets game 
today he was going after the black vote while visiting a public 
school in east harlem before campaign trips stops in buffalo and 
rochester 
bush said in a speech in syracuse that he had no problem 
running against the ghost of jimmy carter 
do you want americans to go back to those terrible days of 
malaise and darkness he asked 
explaining to reporters why he was campaigning against carter 
who left office in 1981 bush said it was because the policies of 
the democrats will take us right back to the high interest rates 
and the doubledigit inflation of the carter years 
bush also said he hopes indicted former white house aides john 
poindexter and oliver north are exonerated in the irancontra 
affair but he refused to say whether he would pardon either if he 
became president 
a pardon imputes guilt he said and the american system 
after all is innocent until proven guilty 
im not going to get into that he added if i had to face 
that at some time then ill keep my own counsel and make my own 
decision 
all the candidates were pulling out their advertising guns with 
jackson spending a record amount for his campaign 500000 and 
running an antidrug advertisement produced by filmmaker spike lee 
dukakis who previously had said he was running two ads 
unveiled a third ad also against drugs the ad also had a 
foreignpolicy twist attacking the reagan administration for its 
previous support of panamanian military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega

president reagan told young business 
executives wednesday they should work to keep the white house in 
republican hands this fall if they want to protect their interests 
reagan did not make a direct pitch for vice president george 
bush who is expected to be the gops presidential nominee but did 
say the election could determine whether there is a healthy 
business climate 
and i want to ask you to become active and involved this year 
because the stakes are too high and the choice too clear for it to 
be left up to others reagan said 
speaking to members of the young presidents organization in the 
old executive office building reagan said that if the policies 
under which your companies have flourished are reversed how could 
your companys bottom line not suffer 
we cannot afford to have american businessmen once again 
treated like a bunch of hired hands laboring on the federal farm 
he said where the folks in washington act as if what you produce 
belongs to them 
reagan said that under his leadership the nation has entered 
the 65th month of recovery from the 198182 recession the longest 
peacetime expansion and said nearly 16 million jobs have been 
created during this period 
its no coincidence that while weve held down the rate of 
growth in government the private economy has been booming he 
said real gnp gross national product grew by nearly 5 percent 
in the fourth quarter last year and inflation remains low 
without singling out any of the democratic candidates for 
president reagan made clear he does not believe any of them would 
create conditions favorable to businesses 
america will face choices this fall that will determine what 
lies ahead for american business and the economy he said if 
we can continue the progrowth policies of the last seven years i 
believe that the next decade will be known as the roarin 90s 
the choice we face is a very simple one is the federal 
government going to grow or is your business going to grow 
reagan has remained neutral in the republican party presidential 
sweepstakes although it has been increasingly clear he favors 
bush presidential aides have said that reagan likely will be 
actively involved in the general election campaign

about 100 us marines engaged in a 
twohour firefight with about 40 unidentified intruders at a 
military fuel tank farm in a jungle area a us military spokesman 
said today 
col ron sconyers chief public affairs officer for the us 
southern command told a news conference there were no apparent 
injuries on either side in tuesday nights fighting it was the 
second reported incident of its kind in two days at the tank farm 
in howard air force base near panama city 
the firefight took place at the arriajan tank farm an 800acre 
depot where a marine was shot and killed monday night while 
investigating what us officials called a suspected breakin by 
six to eight camouflaged men 
a defense department spokesman in washington said the victim 
appeared to have been shot accidentally by fellow marine guards 
but suggested the incident was sparked by the intrusion of 
panamanian military personnel 
the panamanian government said the statement was totally false 
and stupid and aimed at justifying a military intervention 
sconyers said a 12man marine patrol reported receiving fire at 
about 735 pm edt tuesday from a location where they had observed 
between 40 and 50 unauthorized personnel 
the marines returned the fire sporadic firing continued for 
about two hours sconyers said 
sconyers said the marine patrol summoned reinforcements who 
engaged the intruders in small arms fire followed by three high 
explosive mortar rounds at their suspected positions and 
illuminated the area with aerial flares 
sconyers said the intruders were wearing dark uniforms and had 
some kind of military hats but declined to identify them as 
members of the panamanian defense forces 
i can neither confirm nor deny that they were pdf he said 
on monday night a us marine cpl ricardo m villahermosa 
25 was killed while investigating a suspected breakin at the 
storage depot 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said tuesday that villahermosa 
apparently was shot accidentally by fellow marine guards but added 
there had been a series of intrusions at the base in recent weeks 
by individuals who were uniformed and camouflaged 
about two hours after the fighting tuesday most of panama city 
was plunged into darkness by an apparently unrelated power failure 
earlier another southern command spokesman lt cmdr doug 
schamp told reporters there was no reason at all at this time 
to suspect panamanian military involvement in mondays shooting 
incident 
gen manuel antonio noriega the countrys de facto leader and 
head of its 15000strong defense forces has so far successfully 
defied us efforts to force him out of office 
the reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on panama 
after noriega was indicted on us drug trafficking charges in 
february panamas banks have been closed for more than a month and 
the economy is in a shambles but noriega has maintained power 
in a statement tuesday night the defense forces public 
relations director maj edgardo lopez called howards suggestion 
totally false and stupid 
another panamanian military spokesman maj daniel delgado 
diamante later called howards comments an act of provocation 
aimed at justifying an aggression against our territory our 
people 
schamp said there have been numerous intrusions in the area over 
the years the most recent by a poacher caught with two dead 
animals last week 
villahermosa of santurce puerto rico was one of nearly 2000 
marines and army personnel sent to panama in the past few weeks to 
step up security for the panama canal other us installations and 
american citizens 
officials said he was a member of i company 3rd battalion 4th 
marine regiment of camp lejuene nc and had arrived just a week 
ago 
sconyers said villahermosa was part of a 12man marine patrol at 
the depot 
the southern command and the pentagon issued identical 
statements saying the shooting monday occurred after an apparent 
intrusion by six or eight individuals into the tank farm area 
sconyers said the marine had been shot in the stomach and died 
from massive internal bleeding the pentagon said the incident was 
under investigation

as chinas legislature on wednesday ended what 
has been officially described as its most democratic session ever 
there was one enlightening and slightly embarrassing moment 
the presiding official xi zhongxun introduced a measure for 
passage and asked for comment but there was none 
approved he declared without waiting for the usual 
formality of a show of hands a titter went through the massive 
great hall of the people 
habit murmured one chinese reporter 
china will have to shake off many habits bred during more than 
2000 years of imperial rule and nearly 40 years of communist 
authoritarianism if it is to become democratic 
many chinese do not believe such a drastic change is possible 
or even entirely desirable 
its only a matter of form said one college student 
talking about real democracy in china is out of the question 
the top leaders have stressed that they dont intend to 
relinquish the communist partys leading role instead as the 
national peoples congress chairman wan li told the congress 
closing session the goal is to fully arouse the peoples 
enthusiasm for socialism and the huge task of modernizing chinas 
largely peasant economy 
wan used the word democracy 17 times in the 10minute address 
during the 20day congress delegates spoke out more frankly on 
chinas economic and social problems than at any previous session 
staterun newspapers published letters and phone calls from 
nondelegates commenting on the proceedings also with rare 
frankness 
the delegates and letter writers complained about inflation too 
little money for education the need for roads or other projects in 
their home regions and official corruption some suggested that 
many leaders talk a good line but dont do much to correct problems 
the number of letters sent to the congress 460000 by sunday 
and the number of dissenting votes cast in approving congress 
reports and new laws have been publicized as evidence that china is 
becoming more democratic 
the number of votes opposing the election of various officials 
was not officially released but unofficial reports said as many as 
500 of the 2970 delegates opposed some communist partyselected 
candidates 
what has now been achieved in this respect would have been 
utterly unthinkable 10 years ago the englishlanguage china 
daily said in an editorial typical of those published in the state 
media in recent days 
ordinary chinese wonder how long this passion for criticism will 
go on and how far 
if people were to become really active im afraid the leaders 
would have to strengthen their control said a college student 
older chinese remember the 1956 hundred flowers movement during 
which intellectuals were encouraged to speak frankly and then were 
punished 
wait and see what happens to those who speak out now cautioned 
a man peddling a cart 
fear and a sense of futility will make it difficult for the 
frankness movement to filter down to ordinary people 
the vast majority of chinese follow politics chiefly to know 
which way to duck when the next change comes not to formulate 
opinions of their own 
most chinese dont get very excited about things since the 
cultural revolution said one apolitical young man referring to 
the 196676 far leftist campaign to end all political campaigns 
during which hundreds of thousands of people were purged 
of more than a dozen chinese interviewed on the street not one 
believed his opinion could have an affect on government action 
the congress and the laobaixing the ordinary people are 
two different things said one man 
asked if the congress delegate from his district had accurately 
conveyed local peoples concerns he said we dont have a 
representative then qualified it i dont know my delegate 
right now the ordinary people are worried about prices and the 
standard of living said a woman 
but china badly needs to inspire its people to hard work if it 
is to reach its goal of doubling the gross national product by the 
year 2000 
so far wage bonuses for increased production have inspired many 
chinese to work harder but leaders caution that not everyone will 
be able to get rich and inflation will continue to eat at the 
gains nonmaterial incentives are needed to revive the jaded 
populace and a dose of democracy may be senior leader deng 
xiaopings pragmatic prescription 
still unclear is whether it will work or whether it will work 
too well and raise expectations for democracy beyond what the 
leadership plans to deliver 
chinese citizens are free to express their opinion premier 
li peng told a news conference wednesday but he added within 
the scope of the law and regulations set by local governments

the leader of the dominant christian democrat party 
formed italys 48th postwar government on wednesday from the same 
five moderate parties that made up the previous coalition 
ciriaco de mita said he will present his government to 
parliament next week for approval 
giovanni goria a fellow christian democrat resigned as premier 
march 11 after eight turbulent months in office the alliance 
which has figured in nearly all the governments this decade also 
included the socialists republicans social democrats and liberals 
also remaining the same are many of the faces in the cabinet 
including foreign minister giulio andreotti a christian democrat 
and defense minister valerio zanone a liberal 
asked if the new government would last through the end of the 
legislative term in 1992 de mitas rival former socialist premier 
bettino craxi said tuesday it would be a miracle 
de mita after announcing the government on wednesday was asked 
about craxis comment men dont produce miracles de mita said 
the new premier will have to grapple with some of the same 
complex and sticky issues that bedeviled goria they include the 
future of italys energy policy and how to reform a cumbersome 
lawmaking process and bureaucracy 
in negotiations leading to de mitas announcement that he had 
succeeded in forming a government the parties put off a decision 
on whether to complete a nuclear plant north of rome 
president francesco cossiga on march 16 asked de mita to try to 
put together a government factional fighting among christian 
democrats gorias own party had beleagured the goria government 
hastening its demise 
the final straw for goria was strong socialist objections to a 
government decision to go ahead with construction on the power 
plant despite a voter referendum which effectively called for a 
moratorium on nuclear development 
right after de mitas announcement of the cabinet some social 
democrats said they were unhappy with the two members of their 
party chosen for the cabinet 
however they said they would support the government 
de mita 60 has been leader of the christian democrats since 
1982 the party regularly winning about onethird of the votes is 
italys largest ballotgetter and its leadership is considered the 
countrys most powerful political seat 
de mita is the first christian democrat to hold both the 
premiership and the party helm in 29 years christian democrats 
will decide if they like that novelty in the fall when the party 
convention is expected to be held 
the new premier has said that also holding the party post gives 
him the authority to govern effectively 
the son of a tailor de mita was born in nusco a poor mountain 
village east of naples his bald pate delights political satirists 
he was first elected to parliament in 1963 and has held cabinet 
posts none of them key ones 
for the first time there is more than one woman minister with 
cultural affairs joining special affairs as ministries headed by 
women

militant sikhs fired a barrage of 
bullets around the golden temple on wednesday and raised the 
outlawed flag of their visionary sikh nation to mark the holy 
harvest festival of baisakha 
the shooting sent many pilgrims who visit the shrine for a 
ritual bath on holidays running for cover shopkeepers outside the 
temple sikhisms holiest shrine closed their shutters in fear 
police said the firing at the pool surrounding the golden temple 
was evidence that the militants were gathering weapons inside the 
complex 
the golden temples chief priest jasbir singh rode said that 
if police enter the golden temple the foundation for a separate 
state will be laid 
baisakha commemorates both the harvest and the anniversary of 
guru gobind singhs introduction of the socalled baptism by sword 
for sikhs in 1699 the guru was the 10th and last in the faith 
the militants at the golden temple fired automatic rifles and 
other weapons for about 15 minutes and raised the outlawed saffron 
flag of khalistan the name they give their wouldbe state police 
and witnesses said 
there were no reports of injuries but police said many of the 
estimated 400 pilgrims at the temple panicked 
police also said for the first time that the militants were 
building fortifications inside the temple complex and chipping 
gunholes into walls apparently to protect against any entry of 
police or soldiers into the shrine 
in talwandi sabo about 120 miles south of amritsar rode told 
about 40000 sikhs that if police enter the golden temple the 
foundation for a separate state will be laid 
rode is the nephew of jarnail sing bhindranwale who is regarded 
as the founder of the militant sikh movement 
bhindranwale was killed during the indian armys 1984 raid on 
the golden temple complex which was aimed at driving militants 
from the shrine hundreds of sikhs were killed and prime minister 
indira gandhi was assassinated later that year by sikh bodyguards 
rode announced the merger of two factions of the the merger of 
two factions of the all india sikh students federation which is at 
the forefront of the militant movement 
sikh extremists have been waging a guerrilla war since 1982 for 
more political autonomy or a separate homeland in punjab state 
sikhs are a religious minority in india and claim discrimination by 
the majority hindus but they are a majority in punjab 
sikhs have been blamed for killing more than 715 people this 
year 
in new delhi prime minister rajiv gandhi told moderate sikhs 
who came to his home with holiday greetings that there was a 
conspiracy to alienate the sikhs from the rest of indian society 
the united news of india quoted gandhi as repeating his 
accusation that rival pakistan was aiding sikh militants who are 
fighting for an independent sikh homeland the challenge he said 
has to be met collectively by the people of india 
gandhi said the government was prepared to talk with anyone 
within the framework of the constitution ruling out the 
militants demand that talks focus on formation of a separate sikh 
nation

the ethiopian governments decision to shut 
down an international relief effort has raised the specter of a 
human catastrophe with more than 2 million people facing 
starvation the state department said wednesday 
department spokesman charles redman accused ethiopia of 
sacrificing the interests of millions of its citizens in pursuit of 
military objectives in two northern provinces where antigovernment 
rebellions have been under way for years 
he said the united states does not accept ethiopias contention 
that the decision was made for the security of persons in that 
area that the expulsions of relief workers is temporary and that 
indigenous organizations can take up the slack 
these claims ring hollow against the sheer magnitude of the 
disaster redman said 
he said that even before the recent fighting the combined 
international and local feeding effort was slowly losing ground to 
the growing numbers of hungry people 
to assert that greatly reduced operations can now succeed is 
folly the spokesman said the world cannot stand idly by and 
permit innocent people to die 
redman called on ethiopia to reconsider its decision and to 
allow relief operations on an open roads open risk basis 
without a quick resumption he said hundreds of thousands of lives 
may be lost 
a united nations emissary is expected to arrive in addis ababa 
on thursday to encourage ethiopian authorities to resume relief 
activities 
the ethiopian decision was the result of a dramatic escalation 
in the conflict in eritrea and tigray provinces where many of the 
towns that served as distribution points have been taken by forces 
opposed to the marxist government 
the united states has pledged a contribution of 250000 tons of 
food to ethiopia for this fiscal year comparable to the amount 
promised by the soviet union ethiopias principal ally 
total confirmed pledges by all foreign donors combined add up to 
about 890000 tons 
the us contribution amounts to 907 million excluding 66 
million for transportation costs

inspected the statue he found it was facing the fondren library to

president reagan said today he fears that 
public criticism of jesse jacksons campaign positions has been 
muted because of concern that it could be considered racist 
answering questions during an appearance the american society of 
newspaper editors convention reagan said it seems to him that 
more attention is being paid to the difference in color than is 
being paid to what he jackson is actually saying 
reagan rarely has singled out any of the democratic candidates 
for criticism usually assailing general party positions on issues 
but when asked to assess the state of civil rights in this 
country during a year in which a black is running for president 
reagan said of jackson 
i have to believe that a great many of us would find ourselves 
in great disagreement with the policies that he is proposing and 
would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasnt for concern 
that thatd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial attack 
reagan whose administrations civil rights record was 
criticized by supreme court associate justice thurgood marshall 
late last year said the most frustrating thing that ive endured 
since ive been here and the imagemaking that goes on is that 
ive been portrayed so often as in some way a racist or prejudiced 
with regard to racial matters 
its hard for me to take the president said because i 
grew up in a family in which that was considered the greatest sin 
prejudice and discrimination 
reagan went on to say he had opposed discrimination all my 
life 
back when i was a sports announcer broadcasting major league 
baseball i was one of the little handful across the country that 
continued to editorialize for the breaking of the ban and the 
allowing of blacks into organized baseball he said 
but reagan also said i just regret that race has become a 
factor in the 1988 presidential campaign 
the candidates campaigns should all be based on what are 
their policies and what is it that they would propose to do he 
said 
and i would be very frank with you i find a great 
disagreement with some of the things that are being proposed by 
jesse jackson but i also find a great deal of disagreement with 
his fellow candidates in that party which is why ive suggested 
everybody support a republican reagan added 
he did not spell out which jackson positions he did not like 
asked how he thought the presidential sweepstakes would turn 
out reagan said that in the republican party of course it has 
now narrowed down to one candidate george bush but even so there 
is a convention to be held 
and on the other side he said i dont know whether the 
candidates now campaigning whether anyone of them is going to 
wind up at the convention with the nomination or whether there will 
be a brokered convention or whether the democratic party will go 
afield seeking to draft someone who has not been campaigning in the 
primaries 
i just refuse to try to make a guess on this reagan said

ethiopias chief relief official 
said wednesday that full drought aid operations in the north will 
resume only after the government defeats rebel troops 
western relief officials fear this will cause deaths from 
starvation within weeks 
our worry is not only the problem of famine but the integrity 
of the country berhanu jembere head of the government relief 
and rehabilitation commission told the associated press in an 
interview 
it is the obligation of any government to defend its 
territory he said of the civil wars in eritrea and tigre that 
have crippled efforts to feed 32 million drought victims as 
soon as the area is cleansed of bandit activity we will resume our 
operation 
berhanu could not give a date i have to leave that to the 
military personnel in charge of the situation 
also wednesday the government warned crossborder operations to 
get relief food to the north would be met with an appropriate 
response 
the tigre peoples liberation front in march announced it had 
stockpiled 9 tons of food in neighboring sudan and would deliver it 
to areas it controlled in ethiopia this month 
a strongly worded statement from ethiopias ministry of foreign 
affairs said it had no doubt that sudan will not fall prey to the 
machinations of sinister forces and collaborate in such a serious 
breach of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ethiopia 
after years of official silence ethiopia two weeks ago admitted 
to being at war after losing or abandoning much of the north to 
secessionist rebels who have been fighting 27 years in eritrea and 
14 years in tigre 
the government pullback and last weeks expulsion of foreign aid 
workers has left the entire relief operation to berhanus 
commission and the joint relief project a christian consortium 
that includes the ethiopian orthodox church and is closely involved 
with indigenous aid agencies 
berhanu claimed his agency could feed 24 million people but 
said neither his commission nor the christians could operate 
outside small areas still under government control 
western relief officials say the commission and the relief 
project together could feed only 1 million people at most 
they said starvation deaths could begin within weeks and expect 
mass migration of the hungry toward mekele in tigre and the 
eritrean capital of asmara two towns still held by the government 
berhanu said the government already has set up feeding centers 
there and was preparing other contingency plans including 
shelters for refugees who include civil servants and local 
government officials fleeing the wars 
the government and aid agencies for months have tried to avoid 
shelters during the 198485 famine which killed about 1 million 
ethiopians more people died from diseases contracted in 
overcrowded unsanitary feeding camps than from starvation 
berhanu stood firm on ethiopias expulsion of about 60 
expatriates from eritrea and tigre and rejected relief agencies 
requests for a skeleton staff to remain to monitor food 
distribution 
the foreign ministry statement warned continued 
misrepresentation of the evacuation order could compel the 
ethiopian government to suspend their services altogether 
it suggested some relief workers were spies saying some have 
started shedding crocodile tears perhaps because a few of their 
agents masquerading as relief workers are no longer in place to 
continue to perpetrate their sinister roles 
berhanu warned of grave consequences unless all foreign 
workers of the international committee of the red cross left the 
north by wednesday red cross spokesman vincent bernard said five 
western employees were expected to return wednesday night 
the relief operation relied almost solely on huge food shipments 
from western donors and heavily on westernfinanced trucks and 
airplanes 
berhanu said c130 cargo planes carrying grain to mekele would 
be allowed to continue operations but all light aircraft must 
leave ethiopia most of the small planes ferried passengers but 
some carried food to inaccessible regions south of tigre and 
eritrea

two convicted murderers commandeered an 
ambulance wednesday and held a prison guard and three medical 
workers hostage but police stormed the vehicle after two of the 
hostages bolted and the other two escaped unharmed 
the two inmates were recaptured unhurt and returned to the 
tennessee state penitentiary police said 
edward corley 35 and jerry lynn driver 22 face charges of 
escape aggravated kidnapping and aggravated assault authorities 
said

emergency medical technicians who came to the prison after one of 
the inmates apparently faked an illness 
the hostages were identified as nurse vivian bone prison guard 
robert peebles and medical technicians morris tidwell and james 
pollard said metro nashville police homicide detective david 
miller 
the two men forced the hostages into the ambulance early 
wednesday and drove east on interstate 40 about 10 miles the 
ambulance was stopped and surrounded near the stewarts ferry pike 
area east of the city maj frank galbaugh said 
galbaugh said one of the paramedics may have been able to warn 
police of the escape over the ambulances radio 
negotiators dealing with the suspects over the radio obtained 
the freedom of one of the hostages 
the hostage negotiators did a real good job in getting one of 
the emts released and he was debriefed galbaugh said 
meanwhile we set up our tactical operation and when the 
negotiators reached an impasse they turned it over to the swat 
team 
the special weapons and tactics team had surrounded the 
ambulance and when the second paramedic bolted from the vehicle 
they moved in galbaugh said 
the suspects were getting hysterical threatening to kill the 
hostages galbaugh said that emt was a brave individual to get 
out and give us a chance 
galbaugh said no injuries were reported but said the two 
inmates might have been shaken up during their arrest 
when we disarmed them both and took them out of the vehicle 
they might have been bounced around a little bit he said 
were very happy that nobody got hurt seriously 
when the swat team entered the vehicle corley was lying on one 
of the two benches in the rear of ambulance holding ms bone by 
the neck galbaugh said driver was lying on the floor near the 
drivers seat and peebles was sitting on the other bench galbaugh

a house subcommittee was stymied wednesday on 
the issue of whether to slap aid sanctions on five hemispheric 
neighbors for not doing their part in the war on drugs 
the foreign affairs western hemisphere subcommittee deadlocked 
in a 66 tie on whether to penalize mexico the bahamas peru 
paraguay and bolivia all countries on a state department list of 
major drugproducing and transit points 
the impasse similar to one reached a day earlier in the senate 
foreign relations committee sent the five separate resolutions to 
the full foreign affairs committee without recommendation full 
committee action is likely next week 
during debate over the issue a standoff emerged between 
lawmakers who feel domestic political pressure to strike a blow 
against drug trafficking and those who believe imposing sanctions 
on allies and neighbors would do more harm than good 
these nations may feel themselves offended said rep ted 
weiss dny who supported the sanctions bills but these are 
real lifeanddeath threats that my constituents face daily 
rep henry hyde rill argued against the legislation saying 
it was more a political palliative than an effective weapon in the 
war on drugs 
we are not serious about stemming the drug traffic in the 
united states hyde said wed rather point the finger at bolivia 
and paraguay than miami chicago and san francisco 
leonardo ffrench a spokesman for the mexican embassy in 
washington said his country regards the drug problem as a threat 
to its own wellbeing and is devoting all possible resources to the 
battle regardless of pressure from the united states 
we are not looking for cheers or for jeers from abroad the 
spokesman said we ought to strengthen cooperation instead of 
pointing fingers and blaming each other that might only favor the 
interests of the drug traffickers themselves 
under the law countries identified as drug production or 
transit points must be certified by the president each year as 
fully cooperating with us antidrug efforts or risk losing 
half their aid money trade preferences such as sugar import 
quotas and us support for loans from international development 
banks 
on march 1 president reagan made such a certification for 17 of 
the 24 countries on the drug production and transit list including 
mexico the bahamas and bolivia the administration said paraguay 
wasnt cooperating sufficiently but certified it anyway for 
national security reasons as the law allows 
because none of the countries receives large amounts of us 
economic and military aid the sanctions would have little economic 
effect the country with the most at stake is bolivia which gets 
about 22 million in economic aid 
but their political impact is potentially great usmexico 
relations always are delicate and the mexican government has 
served notice privately that if congress succeeds at 
decertification cooperation with antidrug efforts will be sharply 
curtailed and us authorities may be kicked out of the country 
the senate is likely to take up as soon as thursday similar 
sanctions bills dealing with mexico and the bahamas and a separate 
measure adding haiti to the list of countries that should come 
under increased scrutiny because of drug trafficking

convicted murderer leslie lowenfield went to 
his death wednesday in the louisiana electric chair professing his 
innocence to the end as two relatives of his victims looked on 
lowenfields attorney had argued unsuccessfully in the last 
appeals that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who could not 
comprehend the possibility of execution four members of the us 
supreme court indicated support for a stay of execution but a 
majority of five turned the appeal down 
lowenfield 34 was convicted of gunning down his estranged 
girlfriend sheila thomas and four members of her family 
including a 4yearold daughter in 1982 
miss thomas sister and her husband connie and bryan encalade 
were in the front row of witnesses who watched lowenfield die in 
the electric chair shortly after midnight 
connie and bryan i hope you all feel satisfied lowenfield 
said in his brief final statement he stood directly in front of 
the couple looking into their faces from three feet away behind a 
window 
dont give up on me although my life will be over tonight 
because the one responsible is still out there he said no 
reason to hold anything against me and the rest who would lie 
under prison rules the witnesses were not allowed to talk to 
reporters after the execution 
in the eight hours before he died the appeal was rejected in 
quick succession by the louisiana supreme court and three federal 
courts 
lowenfield was the only man in recent louisiana history to 
receive three death sentences 
he was found guilty of shooting miss thomas 27 who was a 
jefferson parish sheriffs deputy her daughter shantel osborne 
4 her stepfather owen griffin 45 her mother myrtle griffin 
44 and the little girls father carl osborne 33 prosecutors 
said notes written by lowenfield showed he was jealous of osborne 
though his final appeal hinged on the argument that lowenfield 
was mentally ill lowenfield insisted he was in florida at the time 
of the murders and refused to allow an insanity defense at the time 
of his original trial 
five of the nine us supreme court justices opposed delaying 
the execution justice william brennan wrote a dissent joined by 
thurgood marshall harry blackmun and john paul stevens issued a 
separate statement indicating they would have granted the requested 
stay a court spokeswoman said 
during lowenfields final hours he was paid a surprise visit by 
louisiana state university basketball coach dale brown 
regardless if hes guilty or not guilty i imagined the fear 
he must be experiencing brown said afterward he said lowenfield 
had been writing him letters since they met in 1984 when brown and 
some of his players visited the prison 
i saw no fear brown said i saw no bitterness i never 
saw it in any letters either he said he heard tuesday that 
lowenfields execution was imminent and he reread all the letters 
before deciding to call and ask to see him 
lowenfield was the 97th person put to death in the united states 
since the supreme court allowed states to restore the death penalty 
in 1976 and the fourth this year seventeen of the executions have 
been in louisiana

stephen craig schiefelbein was already on trial 
for murder when a prosecutor realized the case was in the wrong 
county setting off debate over whether a defense lawyer who knew 
of the mixup was right to keep mum and whether schiefelbein must go 
free 
it would be a miscarriage of justice if he were able to escape 
because of a problem like that said steve roberts the chief 
assistant district attorney in dekalb county where prosecutors 
hope to renew the charges that had to be dismissed in neighboring 
fulton county 
but bob joiner schiefelbeins public defender isnt 
apologizing 
all this guys got going for him is me he said wednesday 
if ive got to help the prosecutor my god hed be better off 
without a lawyer 
schiefelbein 38 was accused of fatally stabbing a man who 
befriended him and invited him to dinner on christmas eve 1986 the 
stabbing occurred in a home in an atlanta neighborhood which 
crosses the fultondekalb county line 
law officers in both counties had assured prosecutors the house 
was in fulton county said assistant district attorney linda 
finley and no one contradicted them until the first day of 
schiefelbeins trial had been completed april 5 in fulton county 
superior court 
then ms finley said she telephoned the owner of the house 
who was to testify the next day to go over his testimony and he 
informed me that his house was in fact about two houses over the 
line in dekalb county 
the next day superior court judge philip etheridge declared a 
mistrial and lectured joiner who said he had known the case was in 
the wrong court the judge told joiner he wasted a lot of time 
and did your client absolutely no service whatever 
joiner contends what he really did was earn an eventual 
acquittal for his client he said federal courts have held that 
part of a criminal case is proving it is being brought in the right 
court so failure to prove that amounts to failure for the entire 
prosecution another prosecution for the same crime would violate 
the constitutions ban on double jeopardy joiner argued 
in an interview etheridge disagreed saying his court never 
really had jurisdiction over the case so anything we did would be 
a nullity 
therefore the judge said joiner had no reason to withhold his 
information except to delay things 
geoffrey c hazard jr a yale law school professor of legal 
ethics who was the main draftsman of the american bar associations 
model code of ethics said joiner was under no obligation to tell 
the judge what he knew 
clearly not he had an obligation not to say anything 
hazard said 
the defendant in a criminal case is permitted to require the 
state to go to its proof on every possible issue and its the 
states responsibility to carry the burden in that respect he 
said the defendant did nothing to mislead the prosecution and i 
think joiner did the right thing 
if he wins his argument that schiefelbein cannot be tried again 
joiner said it will not be a case of an obviously guilty man going 
free he said schiefelbein the victim michael g hadden and 
others in the house had been drinking no one present at first 
thought haddens wound was serious enough to summon help joiner 
said raising the possibility he might have died from a lack of 
medical attention 
schiefelbein also contends hadden was choking him he said 
roberts said the dekalb county district attorneys office will 
not decide whether to prosecute schiefelbein until his case file 
and the judges order are received from fulton county

the chinese legislature ended its annual session 
wednesday with tributes to retiring leaders and promises from the 
new ones to make economic development their top priority 
the national peoples congress completed the business of its 
20day session by approving laws promising company managers and 
foreign joint ventures freedom from government interference in 
making business decisions 
the delegates also voted to make hainan island in the south 
china sea a new province and a special economic zone intended to 
attract foreign hightech joint ventures 
the congress made up of 2970 delegates who serve fiveyear 
terms was characterized by unprecedented criticism of chinas vast 
economic and social problems and by a strong commitment to the 
economic and political reform program of senior leader deng 
xiaoping 
the present congress should make it its primary duty to ensure 
and promote reform newly elected congress chairman wan li said 
in a speech to the closing session in the great hall of the people 
wans predecessor peng zhen was a harsh critic of the reforms 
and growing western cultural influences that have accompanied them 
including pressure for democratacy 
wan thanked a sourlooking peng for having increased the 
influence of the national peoples congress peng helped draft a 
new constitution in 1982 that gave the congress the power to enact 
laws 
the new president yang shangkun a close ally of deng also 
paid tribute to his predecessor li xiannian 78 who asked to 
retire 
the delegates voted by a show of hands to approve the laws and a 
series of work reports delivered to the congress one to three 
delegates voted no on nearly every item including the keynote 
report delivered by acting premier li peng on the congress opening 
day 
three delegates voted against the report and six abstained the 
official xinhua news agency said the approved version contained 100 
amendments to the one li originally delivered and included a new 
emphasis on protecting the autonomy of chinas minority groups 
at a rare news conference later wednesday in the great hall li 
told reporters the report was drafted collectively by the top 
leadership he dismissed foreign news reports that he and communist 
party chief zhao ziyang clashed over its content and tone 
zhao is an enthusiastic supporter of rapid modernization while 
li has stressed the need to move cautiously 
zhao and i have no differences on political issues li said 
there is some comment in the foreign press that zhao favors 
reform and im in favor of stabilizing the economy they 
somehow pit these two views agaist each other 
the 59yearold li also denied that his rapid rise in politics 
was due to nepotism li orphaned at age 3 was adopted and raised 
by the late premier chou enlai one of chinas most popular 
leaders 
i think my promotion has nothing to do with him li said 
there was heavy coverage in the official media of congress 
delegates demanding stronger government action to solve such 
problems as inflation stagnating grain production and a shortfall 
of education funds 
li promised that the government and party would try to 
formulate solutions 
he also said the leadership welcomed the comments of university 
students who in the past week held a lowkey sitin in tiananmen 
square calling for more money for education

black denison university students called 
off a twoday boycott of classes wednesday after the schools 
president stiffened the punishment for two white students found 
guilty of racial harassment 
the black student union which had called the boycotts monday 
and tuesday suspended the action after university president andrew 
de rocco ordered the two whites to leave the campus for the 
remainder of the semester 
the students who have not been identified by the university 
were given until 5 pm wednesday to leave 
the university judicial board comprised of four students and 
four faculty members had earlier found the white students guilty 
of racial harassment of a black student and ordered the whites be 
suspended for the 1988 fall term that suspension will remain in 
effect but de rocco on tuesday night announced the additional 
sanctions 
the issues raised by this case have led to an expression of 
intense feelings on the campus among students faculty and others 
to an interruption of classes and to an atmosphere that is not 
conducive to the orderly processes of student and faculty life 
de rocco said 
the two white students were accused of harassing aaron laramore 
a black senior from toledo laramore claimed in a complaint he 
filed against the students that they pounded on the wall between 
their room and his and yelled racial epithets 
the white students testified in their judicial board hearing 
that their remarks came in a private conversation but the black 
student union said the slurs were aimed at laramore the 
dormitorys head resident 
most students continued to attend classes during the twoday 
boycott which was accompanied by rallies to protest campus racism 
and the initial onesemester suspensions 
bheki khumalo a member of the black student union said 
wednesday said the group was not fully satisfied with the 
universitys latest action but believed the protest had 
accomplished its goal 
evidently this was the best the president could do khumalo 
said weve laid the foundation for more things to come on our 
campus 
about 80 of denisons 2100 undergraduates are black according 
to the university a liberal arts school about 25 miles northeast 
of columbus

a study of teenage mothers concludes that those 
who put their children up for adoption did not suffer significantly 
more psychological distress than those who kept their children 
mothers in the two groups reported essentially equal levels of 
satisfaction with self and life and said they were generally happy 
with their decision about the baby the study found 
researchers cautioned the results would apply only to teenage 
mothers who participate in a pregnancycounseling program similar 
to one used by the 269 mothers in the study 
in addition it would be wrong to conclude that it is easy for 
adolescents to relinquish their children wrote steven 
mclaughlin diane manninen and linda winges of battelles health 
and population research center in seattle 
the federally financed study appears in the current issue of 
family planning perspectives 
it includes 123 mothers who reared their children and 146 who 
chose adoption all gave birth to their first child as an unmarried 
teenager and participated in a pregnancy counseling program 
affiliated with a large adoption agency that permits communication 
between biological and adoptive parents 
they filled out a questionnaire six months to seven years after 
the birth researchers considered differences in elapsed time when 
comparing the groups 
both groups reported moderately positive levels of 
selfsatisfaction they did not differ significantly in 
lifesatisfaction child rearers were more likely to call their 
lives difficult 
on a fivepoint scale to measure satisfaction with their 
decision to relinquish or keep the baby relinquishers averaged 
435 less satisfied than the 469 reported by those who kept their 
babies but both scores are high and the difference should be 
interpreted with some caution researchers wrote 
for one thing adolescents who chose to rear their children will 
probably not report regrets because it might be interpreted as not 
loving the child researchers wrote

michael dukakis jesse jackson and albert gore 
jr in a new round of television ads before new yorks democratic 
presidential primary next tuesday are stressing their calls for 
more action against drugs 
in the tv spots dukakis the governor of massachusetts urges 
a real war not a phony war on drugs while gore a senator 
from tennessee says the military should be enlisted in this 
battle meantime jackson having preached against drugs for years 
reviews his ideas with filmmaker spike lee in an ad set to start 
thursday 
this is the first time jackson has had enough money for a media 
campaign to rival those mounted by gore and dukakis and reflects 
jacksons fundraising success since his strong showings in recent 
primaries and caucuses 
jackson spokesman eric easter said the campaign expected to 
purchase tv time worth about 500000 10 times more than what 
jackson spent on media for the april 5 wisconsin primary dukakis 
won in wisconsin jackson ran second and gore finished third 
we plan to run a number of commercials easter said we 
havent decided which ones to use and when to run them weve just 
decided a ballpark figure on how much were willing to spend 
gore spokesman mark armour said the campaign made a third media 
buy tuesday and were still intending to run a millionplus 
campaign in new york 
steve akey a spokesman for dukakis declined to disclose how 
much the campaign is spending other than saying we can be and we 
will be competitive with everybody in new york 
asked if dukakis would match or outspend his rivals akey 
replied its not always necessary we didnt spend the most 
money in wisconsin you have to be very careful about targeting 
your dollar 
dukakis introduced a new ad tuesday night including excerpts 
from a speech in which he attacked the reagan administrations long 
relationship with panamanian military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
im running for president because i want to see a real war 
not a phony war against drugs and alcohol dependency in this 
country dukakis says how can we tell our children to say no 
to drugs when we have an administration that paid 200000 a year 
to a drugpeddling dictator from panama 
a chief executive can make a difference in the fight against 
drugs a narrator says echoing another ad now running in which a 
narrator points out that of all the candidates only dukakis has 
been an executive with a state to run 
the new jackson ad shows jackson and lee walking down a new york 
street lee comments on the sad state of the neighborhood and the 
devastating impact of drugs on the streets and jackson responds by 
discussing his antidrug positions 
lees character in his movie shes gotta have it mentions 
having met jackson and told him to run for president according to 
easter he said lee has been a jackson supporter for some time 
gore is using an ad stressing his experience as a vietnam 
veteran and another proposing that the military be mobilized to 
fight drugs he added a new spot tuesday night on trade

jewish leaders on wednesday assailed as 
antisemitic political ads appearing in boston subway cars that 
feature a photograph of israeli soldiers subduing an arab and the 
words your tax dollars pay for the violence 
the 200 advertising cards are on subway cars of the 
massachusetts bay transportation authority together bostonarea 
chapters of the mobilization for survival the american friends 
service committee and the lebanon emergency committee paid 2300 
for the monthlong ad campaign which began last week 
the sponsors say their message is only an attack on us policy 
in israel and an endorsement of selfdetermination for 
palestinians but rabbis and other leaders among greater bostons 
180000 jews say the ads are racist 
the advertisements include a photograph of seven israeli 
soldiers guns raised subduing a palestinian youth unrest on the 
west bank and gaza strip has continued since late last year 
the accompanying text reads your tax dollars pay for the 
violence in the israeli occupied territories since december 
thousands of palestinians have been shot beaten and teargassed by 
the israeli military every year the us sends more than 4 
billion in military and economic aid to israel isnt it time to 
speak out no aid for the occupation 
rabbi richard yellin of congregation mishkan tefila in newton 
called the ads blatantly antizionist blatantly antiamerica 
yellin said he tried to get the transit authority to remove the 
ads but he gave up in the face of arguments that the first 
amendment right of free expression protects the ads and the people 
who put them up 
vincent carbona spokesman for the transit authority said the 
advertisements were installed after legal advisers approved them 
yellin said the only recourse is to take out new ads in a 
counterattack but he discarded that idea as likely to inflame the 
issue out of proportion its not worth it its a lowbrow a 
bumpersticker mentality 
philip perlmutter executive director of the jewish community 
relations council of greater boston called the ad campaign to me 
a brazen example of propaganda and hypocrisy these people have 
never spoken up about the violence of arabs against arabs 
melani mcalister middle east staffer at mobilization for 
survival in cambridge denied charges the ads attack jews 
we really believe were standing with israelis and with jews 
and palestinians who support peace and a negotiated peace ms 
mcalister said 
people would have to distort whats there to see it as 
antisemitic she said adding that the organization also works 
to combat antisemitism and racism people have to learn to 
separate israeli government policy and jews 
joseph gerson a jew and a spokesman for the american friends 
service committee called the charges of antisemitism ridiculous 
people have to be able to criticize the policies of a 
government state and what the poster does is call attention to the 
occupation gerson said 
the american friends service committee is run by quakers to 
promote various ideals such as peace and social justice said 
another spokesman robert dove membership is open to nonquakers 
as well as quakers

the navy is doing a poor job of keeping 
records about the millions of items in service inventories of spare 
parts and needs to improve its bookkeeping procedures a 
congressional watchdog agency said wednesday 
the service is doing a better job than it used to but its 
still not good enough said the review by the general accounting 
office 
the navys accounting situation is like a bank forgetting how 
much money it loaned out then asking the borrowers how much they 
owe said sen john glenn dohio chairman of the senate 
governmental affairs committee which asked for the gao review 
the review centered on the naval supply center at norfolk va 
and the ships parts control center in mechanicsburg pa 
the survey was the latest in a series of gao studies of defense 
department recordkeeping and inventory control done for the 
committee over the past four years the panel has focused on 
trying to improve the pentagons management of its vast stockpile 
of spare parts and other items 
in fiscal 1986 the gao found the norfolk center had a record 
accuracy rate of 69 percent meaning that records for almost 
onethird of the items were erroneous 
with a value of roughly 28 billion the navys inventory of 
supply items and repair parts is a significant investment in our 
national defense said glenn 
these supplies must be wellmanaged and ready for delivery on 
short notice we simply cannot tolerate accounting inefficiences 
that could undermine the navys ability to perform its duty we 
need effective supply operations on shore if we are to have 
effective ship operations at sea 
at mechanicsburg officials couldnt account for all the items 
sent to contractors or to other facilities for work meaning the 
items could have been stolen or lost the gao said the center did 
not maintain adequate stock or financial records it said 
in a response that was part of the gao review the pentagon 
generally agreed with the gaos recommendations but disputed the 
criticism 
in the gaos criticism of both navy facilities the report 
exaggerates the significance of observed incidents and does not 
recognize the existence of effective management programs said 
robert costello assistant secretary of defense for production and 
logistics 
the gao said the pentagon should improve administrative 
management of the two centers including requirements that better 
records be kept

the nations private pension funds lost 135 
billion or 104 percent of their assets in the oct 19 stock market 
crash and its wake a private research group said wednesday 
the fourthquarter 1987 loss the largest in five years 
helped reduce the total assets of 800000 pension plans covering 40 
million active and retired workers from 13 trillion to 112 
trillion the employee benefit research institute said 
net capital losses of 152 billion resulting primarily from the 
25 percent decline in stock prices were partially offset by 
dividend payments and interest income of 18 billion the institute 
said 
despite the fourthquarter losses the nations private pension 
plans still finshed 1987 with 376 billion more in assets 
including 292 billion in total capital gains for the year than 
they had at the end of 1986 
altogether the pension plans sold off a net 5 billion or about 
1 percent of their stock holdings in response to the crash the 
institute said 
larger plans with total assets of at least 75 million joined 
the selling spree in reaction to the crash more than smaller plans 
the large plans sold a net 68 billion or 4 percent of their 
equity holdings in the fourth quarter 
the smaller plans apparently finding several bargains in the 
depressed stock prices showed net purchases of 18 billion for 
the quarter 
the institutes data indicates that some pension plan managers 
had anticipated a downturn in the stock market selling off a total 
of 34 billion in stock during the first three quarters of 1987 
the crash did have two significant impacts on pension plans 
according to the data 
first the declining stock prices reduced the equity share of 
their portfolios from 40 percent to 36 percent and the plans paid 
out 455 billion more in benefits than they took in in 
contributions during the quarter

the mother of 7monthold twins conceived 
under a surrogacy contract has agreed to surrender custody to the 
arkansas man who contracted for their birth attorneys said 
wednesday 
the agreement averts a custody trial scheduled to begin next 
week 
laurie yates of ithaca mich and barry huber of jonesboro 
ark reached settlement late tuesday said attorney kathleen boyle 
under the terms of the settlement barry huber has legal and 
physical custody of the children theyll reside with him and his 
wife glinda in arkansas she said 
mrs yates will be allowed to see the twins once a year said 
lisa vogler one of the lawyers who represented the surrogate 
mother in her suit to keep the twins 
nobody was bought off nobody was bought out of the suit 
said attorney robert macalpine who negotiated the settlement for 
mrs yates and her husband richard it was probably the ultimate 
act of love on laurie yatess part 
they realized that in their precarious financial condition 
they could never provide the kind of home for the twins that the 
hubers could he said both are unemployed 
boyle said she did not know when the hubers would be able to 
take the twins homethey were placed in foster care on saturday to 
protect them from stress and attention during the trial that was to 
have begun next week before that the babies divided their time 
between the two families spending two weeks at a time with each 
mrs yates sued for custody before the twins were born 
she had a midpregnancy change of heart about surrogate 
parenting and decided she could not give up her children 
earlier this year gratiot county circuit judge timothy green 
declared the surrogate contract unenforceable so the trial would 
only have determined which set of parents was most fit to raise the 
twins

of fear that any comments would be misinterpreted as some kind of 
racial attack 
it seems that more attention is being paid to the difference

told the american society of newspaper editors convention 
i just regret that this has become a factor he said 
it was the first time reagan had commented on the sensitive 
question of how race has become an issue in the 1988 presidential 
contest jackson a black leader is waging a neckandneck battle 
with massachusetts gov michael dukakis for the democratic 
nomination 
emphasizing his own stand reagan said i find a great 
disagreement with some of the things proposed by jackson who has 
advocated deep cuts in pentagon spending and an array of costly 
social programs 
reagan made his comments in a speech and a question and answer 
session with the audience he also made these points 
he did not know until recently that his former spokesman larry 
speakes had made up quotes in 1983 and 1985 and passed them to 
reporters as reagans own words speakes makes the disclosure in 
his new book speaking out 
reagan said he reads the newspapers every day but he did not 
explain how he missed reading what speakes had done 
i can tell you right now that i have no affection for these 
kissandtell books that are being written and i find it entirely 
fiction reagan said another longtime aide michael k deaver 
published an insider book about reagan last year and another by 
former chief of staff donald t regan is due out in may 
in his speech reagan quipped that one of the nice things about 
his job is that you get to quote yourself shamelessly and if you 
dont larry speakes will the audience laughed 
he expects afghan rebels to continue fighting the marxist 
regime in kabul despite an agreement being signed thursday for the 
withdrawal of 115000 soviet forces after an eightyear occupation 
reagan said there is nothing in the agreement that prevents the 
united states from supplying the rebels as long as they need it 
and as long as the soviet union continues to supply the afghan 
forces in their puppet government 
the us banking system has some troubles but reagan also 
said i dont think it is a problem that could suddenly bring 
disaster down upon us 
discussing politics reagan acknowledged the republican 
presidential race is down to one vice president george bush but 
he did not give bush his endorsement saying there still is a 
convention to be held 
he spoke about jackson when a member of the audience asked him 
to assess civil rights in america in a year in which a black man is 
running for president 
i hope that race will not be a part of this campaign in any 
way reagan said 
but im sorry that in the campaign thats going on with one 
candidate of the black race that it seems that more attention is 
being paid to the difference in color than is being paid to what he 
is actually saying the president said 
and i have to believe that a great many of us would find 
ourselves in great disagreement with the policies that he is 
proposing and would perhaps be more vocal about them if it wasnt 
concern that thatd be misinterpreted into some kind of a racial 
attack reagan added 
defending his own record reagan said one of the most 
frustrating things he has encountered is the charge that he is in 
some way a racist and prejudiced with regard to racial matters 
he said he has battled all his life for the removal of racial 
barriers 
saying race has become a factor in the presidential race reagan 
said the candidates should all be based on what are their 
policies and what is it that they would propose to do 
he said his opposition to jacksons policies is the reason why 
ive suggested everybody support a republican 
reagan refused to hazard any guess on the outcome of the 
democratic contest 
i dont know whether the candidates now campaigning whether 
any one of them is going to wind up at the convention with the 
nomination or whether there will be a brokered convention or 
whether the democratic party will go afield seeking to draft 
someone who has not been campaigning in the primaries reagan 
said

president reagan said wednesday he did not 
learn until recently that his former spokesman larry speakes had 
put words in his mouth on at least two occasions while briefing 
reporters on presidential meetings 
reagan did not directly answer however when asked whether he 
approved of the practice or would allow it to continue his current 
spokesman marlin fitzwater has condemned any such procedure and 
said he never would do it 
speakes says in his new book speaking out that he once 
attributed remarks made by secretary of state george p shultz to 
the president and once collaborated with an aide in making up 
quotes which he then credited to reagan 
reagans first comment on the book came in a questionandanswer 
session after a speech to the american society of newspaper editors 
katherine fanning editor of the christian science monitor and 
president of the editors group asked reagan did you approve of 
that process and would you continue to allow that to happen in 
your white house 
i was not aware of that and just learned it recently the 
president responded as all the rest of you did and i can tell 
you right now that i have no affection for these kissandtell 
books that are being written and i find it entirely fiction 
speakes in an interview on tuesday said i generally told 
him what i had done and the reasons for doing it he never objected 
to these cases where i said ive gone ahead and done this 
speakes who left the white house 14 months ago to become vice 
president for communications of the wall street firm of merrill 
lynch did not immediately return a call seeking comment wednesday 
george reedy who served as a press secretary to president 
johnson said when asked about the faked quotes the thing that 
bothers me is not so much that larry speakes did it but that a 
president would let him get away with it 
reedy now nieman professor of journalism at marquette 
university said in a telephone interview late tuesday it 
bothers me very much that the president would allow somebody to 
come through and put words in his mouth 
reedy said the misattributed shultz remarks which followed the 
shooting down of a korean air lines passenger plane in 1983 and 
the madeup quotations attributed to reagan at the geneva summit 
in 1985 are fairly harmless but thats not the point 
suppose those words got the united states embroiled in some 
real crisis of some sort he said its one thing if the 
president makes a mistake and gets the nation in a crisis but to 
have a statement drawn up by a technician with the presidents name 
stamped on it to get us into a crisis is too much 
reagan also made an oblique reference to the speakes controversy 
in a speech to the editors before he answered questions 
after referrring to a previous speech that he had made reagan 
said thats one of the nice things about this job you get to 
quote yourself shamelessly and if you dont larry speakes will 
reagans reference to kissandtell books evidently referred 
not only to the speakes book but to the book behind the 
scenes by his former deputy chief of staff michael k deaver 
and a forthcoming volume by former chief of staff donald t regan 
in his book speakes says he quoted reagan as saying after the 
downing of the kal jet that the incident posed a problem not 
between the soviet union and the united states but a soviet 
versus the world problem 
he said that comment really came from shultz he said he also 
credited reagan with some suggestions for possible retaliatory 
measures which also had been made by shultz 
in the other instance speakes at the time quoted reagan as 
telling soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during their geneva 
summit meetings there is much that divides us but i believe the 
world breathes easier because we are talking here together 
he said in the book that he and a press aide mark weinberg 
concocted this quotation

an additional 15000 soviet troops have been 
sent into afghanistan during the past week even as the soviets 
prepared to sign a united nations agreement on the withdrawal of 
the red army from afghanistan administration sources said today 
at the same time soviet armored units consisting of an 
undetermined number of troops and 420 vehicles including t72 
tanks armored personnel carriers and mobile rocket launchers 
moved south from kabul toward the city of gardez said intelligence 
sources who have been monitoring the fighting they spoke on 
condition they not be further identified 
the road to gardez where a soviet special forces or spetsnaz 
regiment is garrisoned was cut off recently by the mujahedeen 
guerrillas one source said the city is 80 miles south of kabul 
and 60 miles from the pakistani border 
some analysts believe the soviets will withdraw the spetsnaz 
unit to kabul as they begin to pull the red army from afghnistan 
the advancing column and the spetsnaz regiment are also expected 
to attack stockpiles of guerilla armaments 
under the geneva accords the soviets are supposed to withdraw 
50 percent of their troops within 90 days and us analysts 
believe the red army will concentrate in kabul and around the 
northern city of mazarisharif 
the united nations brokered agreement on withdrawing the soviet 
troops also calls for noninterference and nonintervention by 
foreign powers in afghan affairs and the soviets are expected to 
use that language to pressure pakistan despite a separate deal 
reportedly worked out between the united states and soviet union 
under which both will continue to supply the warring afghan parties

jesse jackson delighted with the decision 
by gov mario cuomo to stay out of the endorsement business 
campaigned in upstate new york on wednesday and was annointed by 
the governor as a singularly important democrat who could win 
in november 
cuomo said jackson was suffering from the dumb blonde 
syndrome in which potential voters think that if a candidate 
demonstrates charisma and passion there is little else there 
nothing could be further from the truth said cuomo an 
eloquent speaker who has complained in the past about being treated 
that way himself of jackson he said he is making this race a 
manifestation of the american idea at its very best 
jackson said he felt it was a wise use of power for cuomo 
and other party leaders to hold off backing any candidate until 
after the primaries jackson said such a position encourages the 
maximum people participation 
governor cuomo just keep a freeze on all endorsements and 
keep extending your support he said 
cuomo has pledged not to endorse any of the three democratic 
candidates before next tuesdays new york primary that was fine 
with jackson who may have thought massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis would get cuomos nod 
jackson and sen albert gore jr are locked in a battle with 
dukakis for the lions share of the 255delegate prize in new york 
a big victory could propel dukakis to the nomination cuomo aides 
said the governor expects to appear later with gore and dukakis 
cuomo has said he will get behind the frontrunner after the 
primaries and help that person collect enough uncommitted support 
to win the nomination and thus avoid a deadlocked convention 
cuomo told jackson that the fact you can get to be president 
or so close that they put your face on the front page of national 
magazines just to explain this phenomenon that is extraordinary 
progress 
i havent heard a candidate address that subject as 
consistently as intelligently as jesse jackson said cuomo of 
jacksons message on combatting drug abuse 
asked whether jackson should be guaranteed a spot on the ticket 
cuomo said there should be no guarantees other than that jackson 
dukakis or gore should be the presidential candidate 
i think it would be a good thing to have a jewish president a 
woman president an italian president a black president a good 
thing to establish to prove that its possible for everybody to 
make it but i wouldnt make that the criteria said cuomo of 
chosing a ticket 
during his breakfast speech jackson turned to a favorite 
campaign theme that a key to battling drugs was more money for 
education and social programs 
four years at state university costs 30000 full 
scholarship said jackson four years at attica costs 160000 
full scholarship thats the message 
jackson said he was encouraged to see the other presidential 
candidates both republicans and democrats speaking out on drugs 
but he said they have come late to the cause 
they are sergeants but i am the bonafide general in this 
war he said

the ptl network will drop jimmy 
swaggarts daily television shows if he tries to return to church 
and television pulpits may 22 a spokesman said wednesday 
the network is currently broadcasting swaggarts show with 
substitute ministers 
theres no doubt it is one of our better accounts its not a 
decision that we would make lightly david west of the ptl 
network in charlotte nc said in a telephone interview 
however west said ptl has a waiting list of other people who 
want time on the cable network which he said reaches an estimated 
12 million homes 
last week the assemblies of god defrocked swaggart because he 
refused to accept a oneyear suspension from preaching because of 
his involvement with a prostitute 
swaggart said friday that the finances of his church and the 
jimmy swaggart bible college couldnt stand up under a oneyear 
suspension he said he was returning to both his church and 
television ministries on may 22 
earl weirich with the christian broadcasting network in 
virginia beach va said officials there will decide tuesday 
whether to continue televising swaggarts programs 
he said cbn which reaches an estimated 39 million homes got a 
mixed bag of calls at the start of the swaggart controversy 
right now we are receiving very little interest there are a 
surprising few letters and phone calls he said 
he said its a marked contrast to what happened when the network 
considered canceling a childrens show 
a while back we talked about cutting off a kids show on our 
network and we were flooded with thousands of calls it was like an 
avalanche 
west said swaggarts television show a study in the word is 
shown three times daily on ptl and there is another swaggart 
telecast shown once on saturday and sunday 
a cable television official said swaggart could buy time on 
dozens of individual television stations to make up for the loss of 
a network however that would be an expensive and cumbersome 
project the official said

exporters have sold china an additional 
350000 metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices for delivery 
this year the agriculture department said wednesday 
the sales equal to about 128 million bushels were handled by 
four companies continental grain co 35000 tons cargill inc 
215000 artfer inc 35000 and louis dreyfus corp 65000 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the sales were part of an 
authorized 2 million tons of wheat announced april 5 under the 
export enhancement program or eep and some left over from an 
earlier authorization 
although no selling prices or other details were announced 
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around 279 
per bushel indicating a us farm value of about 36 million 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
china bought more than 49 million tons of wheat under previous 
eep arrangements which allow exporters to sell commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged 2828 per 
ton or about 77 cents per bushel of wheat the bonuses will be 
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the departments 
commodity credit corp 
china has more than 19 million tons remaining for use under the 
eep initiative announced on april 5 he said

an international panel of judges began a televised 
inquiry wednesday into whether austrian president kurt waldheim 
should be charged with nazi war crimes or is a victim of rumors 
about 40 witnesses are scheduled to testify in nine days before 
the panel which includes shirley hufstedler a former justice of 
the us court of appeals and the education secretary under former 
president jimmy carter 
thirteen german army world war ii veterans who served alongside 
the young waldheim when he was a lieutenant in the balkans are 
among those scheduled to address the panel 
reporters are being allowed to watch some of the proceedings 
but reporting on them will be embargoed until a date to be 
announced by coproducers home box office and britains thames 
television the hearings will be edited to 3 hours for screening 
in britain and the united states on june 5 
in a studioturnedcourtroom at thames london headquarters the 
five judges will try to decide whether waldheim is a victim of 
rumor and exaggeration or whether there is foundation to 
allegations linking the former un secretarygeneral to war crimes 
thames and hbo said six months of research have produced new 
evidence and witnesses that werent available to an international 
historians commission that investigated waldheims wartime 
activities 
that commission said in its february report that waldheim was in 
close proximity to nazi atrocities but did nothing to stop them it 
left open the question of whether he was guilty of war crimes 
himself but it said he had concealed his wartime past 
the producers of waldheim a comission of inquiry say the 
28 million project will be the most serious analysis yet of the 
case against waldheim 
this is unique said telford taylor the us chief 
prosecutor at the 1946 nuremburg trials and a program consultant 
some of adolf hitlers top commanders and perpetrators of 
atrocities were sentenced at nuremburg 
sensitive to charges of trialbytelevision the producers and 
lawyers involved insisted at a news conference that the documentary 
is an inquiry not a mock trial 
we will try to separate rumor speculation and possible 
fiction from fact said retired british appeal judge sir 
frederick lawton the chairman of the judges panel 
we may not succeed but we hope to go a long way to establish 
what really happened 
producer jack saltman said 24 researchers including one who 
read through the entire west german telephone directory had 
tracked witnesses and collected 15000 pages of material from 11 
countries 
hufstedler and lawton are joined by three other retired judges 
west german walter hubner canadian gordon cooper and swede gustav 
petren 
presenting the evidence is a harvard lawyer and former director 
of the us justice departments nazihunting office of special 
investigations allan a ryan challenging the evidence is lord 
rawlinson britains former attorney general 
no one will represent the character of waldheim but saltman 
said he told the president about the proposed documentary in a 
personal interview last summer 
he said something to the effect that nobody but the austrian 
people could try him and by electing him president they had given 
their opinion said saltman 
he also said that if i and what he called the waldheim 
industry searched for 100 years we wouldnt find anything 
producers said no attempt would be made to embellish the 
proceedings with artificial drama 
i dont think anyones going to get rich on this and there 
are no movie stars bridget potter hbos senior vice president 
for original programming said in a telephone interview from new 
york but certainly in this country theres never been a real 
examination on a broad level of the evidence against kurt 
waldheim 
the allegations against waldheim were raised in 1986 during his 
presidential campaign the president denied wrongdoing and the 
historians panel that presented the february report was convened 
at his request

the head of the securities and exchange 
commission on wednesday said he endorsed farreaching legislation 
to permit banks to enter the securities business as long as 
consumers are protected adequately 
sec chairman david s ruder told the house telecommunications 
and science subcommittee that the commission supports the 
senatepassed repeal of the glasssteagall act as long as the 
investor protection concerns arising from the entry of banks into 
securities activities are simultaneously addressed 
glasssteagall is a depressionera law that separated banking 
from the securities business in the aftermatth of the 1929 
financial crash 
ruder told subcommittee chairman edward j markey dmass that 
the commission has accepted the safeguards in the bill sponsored by 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee 
but he said that under ideal conditions the sec would solely 
regulate banks dealing in securities and not share the 
responsibility with the federal reserve board 
if eventually signed into the law the bill which passed the 
senate 942 on march 30 would grant banks immediate power to 
underwrite mortgagebacked securities commercial paper and 
municipal revenue bonds banks would be able to deal in mutual 
funds and corporate bonds six months after enactment 
in a concession to the securities industry the bill withholds 
power from banks to underwrite corporate stock viewed by senators 
as the riskiest securities area unless congress authorizfes that 
in a separate vote in april 1991 
in conjunction with the new securities powers the bill would 
erect fire walls limiting loans and other connections between 
banks and their securities affiliates to prevent risky investment 
activities from endangering federally insured bank deposits 
in the house a more restrictive bill has been circulated by 
banking committee chairman fernand j st germain dri 
banking interests are strongly opposed to the st germain draft 
which would grant much more limited securities powers and includes 
stricter consumer and insurance provisions than the senate bill 
markey who has indicated he is no hurry to push through the 
legislation said congress should concentrate on one special 
interest the public 
deregulation and relaxed supervision make sense as public 
policy only if the unfettered market forces they would unleash work 
naturally to the benefit of the public markey said this is 
clearly not the case with respect to either our securities markets 
or the banking industry 
the plain truth is that in the absence of an adequate 
regulatory structure and proper supervisory vigilance the same 
unchecked market forces that gave us program trading bank failure 
after bank failure and continuing market instability will again 
have free reign he said 
consumer advocate ralph nader told the subcommittee congress 
should not repeal the provisions of the law which prohibit banks 
and bank holding companies from underwriting and dealing with 
corporate securities 
nader representing the center for study of responsive law said 
commercial bank underwriting and dealing in corporate securities 
involves serious conflicts of interest that can injure public 
investors undermine the integrity of capital markets and are not 
readily controlled by any realistically available set of 
safeguards

drug kingpins and people who commit drugrelated murders should 
be executed and quickly

before the states primary also talked with third and 
fourthgraders at a public school in east harlem trying a little 
french on them during a discussion of homework 
during a breakfast speech to the association for a better new 
york the republican presidential candidate called for mandatory 
death penalties for certain drugrelated crimes 
and frankly id like to find a way to make this penalty 
swift he said only a swift penalty will serve as a true 
deterrent 
asked by reporters how punishment could be speeded up without 
infringing on a defendants constitutional rights of due process 
bush responded due process is fine but weve got to find a way 
to speed it up i dont know the answer im not a lawyer 
bush also proposed a drug summit of western nations and called 
for an international antidrug police force under the auspices of a 
global body such as the united nations 
he suggested that the three democratic contenders wouldnt as 
aggressive in pursuing drug traffickers as he would i challenge 
the democrats to stand up on this point you say this is a war 
then treat it as such dont let these killers back on the 
streets 
bush himself has been criticized by democratic candidate jesse 
jackson for offering no leadership as head of the 
administrations south florida task force on drugs 
and candidate michael dukakis unveiled a new television 
advertisement wednesday attacking the reagan administration for its 
previous support of panamanian military strongman manuel antonio 
noriega 
how can we tell our children to say no to drugs when we have 
an administration that paid 200000 a year to a drugpeddling

exciting things 
but now im running for president he said

effort was praised in an editorial in that newspaper 
teeley said that bush worked with the state department in 
helping americare a private humanitarian organization to cut 
through red tape and make the shipment possible he believes in 
the importance of a free press particularly in a country that has 
had very little in the way of independent dissemination of the 
news teeley said 
bush made brief campaign stops in buffalo and rochester before 
heading for a fundraising dinner in scarsdale at the conclusion of 
his threeday swing through new york he was accompanied in buffalo

reagan administration officials expressed 
concern wednesday that a suspect in a 1985 twa jetliner hijacking 
and murder of a us navy diver could be freed after 10 years even 
if convicted under a ruling by a west german court 
the tribunal in the west german state of hesse decided this week 
to turn the case of mohammed hamadi over to a juvenile court to 
decide if he should be tried as a minor or as an adult 
if convicted as an adult he could receive a life term in prison 
but as a juvenile his maximum sentence would be 10 years 
we are urging that if germany tries hamadi in juvenile court 
they try him as an adult where he could receive the maximum 
penalty of life imprisonment in connection with the crimes of the 
hijacking including murder and hostage taking justice department 
spokesman john russell said 
we would be very disappointed if the court tries hamadi as a 
juvenile therefore making him eligible for far less severe 
punishment he said 
hamadi is awaiting trial on charges he led the hijacking of 
twas athenstorome flight 847 in june 1985 and forced it to land 
in beirut where us navy diver robert stethem was shot to death 
hamadi was arrested in frankfurt in 1987 when he allegedly was 
caught at the airport carrying liquid explosives 
last year when west germany rejected a request that hamadi be 
extradited to stand trial in the united states for stethems 
murder us officials consoled themselves with assurances from 
bonn that hamadi was subject to equally stern punishment if 
convicted in frankfurt or washington 
they were consoled again this week that the latest ruling was 
not the ultimate decision on hamadis possible sentence 
german authorities tell us that even if hamadi is tried in a 
juvenile court he could be sentenced as an adult and receive a life 
sentence state department spokesman charles e redman said 
as weve stated before the federal republic of germany has 
given assurances that hamadi will be prosecuted to the full extent 
of german law on all charges associated with the twa 847 case 
including murder hijacking and hostage taking as well as crimes 
committed in the federal republic redman said 
we expect the frg will continue to abide by these assurances 
and hope that hamadi will be tried and sentenced as an adult as he 
would were he were tried in the united states the spokesman said 
redman said press coverage of the case will be permitted most 
juvenile proceedings in the united states are closed to reporters 
redman noted that under west german law juvenile courts receive 
jurisdiction in cases where there is doubt about whether a 
defendant was 21 during all the events leading to a crime 
the court ruled that hamadi was born on june 13 1964 which 
would have made him 21 the day the hijacking began june 14 1985 
a court spokesman said however a possibility exists that the 
perpetration of the crime that he is accused of may have begun 
before june 13 1985 and went back to the time of his 
adolescence 
a state department terrorism expert speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was difficult to argue with the courts logic 
given the requirements of german law if the court had rejected the 
defendants request to be tried in a juvenile court and hamadi were 
convicted in an adult tribunal the conviction might be thrown out 
on appeal the official said 
still this official said there has been some residual 
concern in the department about the effect this will have on the 
possible sentence

mistreated despite a law meant to make sure they have safe and 
permanent homes preferably with their own families congress was 
told wednesday 
the adoption assistance and child welfare amendments passed in 
1980 are not being enforced by the federal government or the states 
and the results are devastating said marcia lowry director of the 
childrens rights project of the american civil liberties union 
the harm to these kids is immeasurable she told a joint 
hearing of two house panels their ability to form relationships 
with adults is destroyed we are breeding a generation of 
psychopaths 
lowry was accompanied by a 12yearold identified as boyd a who 
spent years moving from one new york city foster home to another 
while his mother who had been temporarily hospitalized tried to 
get her five children back it took a class action lawsuit to 
reunite the family 
they didnt let us come back because they said she wasnt well 
enough but that wasnt true boyd said 
sometimes we didnt like to visit our mother you know why 
sometimes they would have to tear us apart we wouldnt leave i

just waiting to come back to my real family 
more than 450000 children spend some time in foster care each 
year as a result of parental illness or disability parentchild 
conflicts a childs severe emotional or behavioral problems or an 
encounter with the law said rep tom downey dny acting 
chairman of the ways and means public assistance subcommittee 
the foster care population declined by over a third between 1977 
and 1984 but it has begun to rise again since then despite the 
early success of the law said rep george miller chairman of 
the select committee on children youth and families we will 
attempt to unravel exactly what has gone wrong 
the 1980 amendments stress preserving and reuniting families as 
well as finding permanent homes for children who cannot return to 
their parents they attempt to protect children in the system by 
requiring case plans and case reviews within specific time frames 
but lowry said the aclu in research for lawsuits in several 
states has found widespread violations of the law and an almost 
complete lack of federal enforcement 
she said states are not monitoring and evaluating cases as 
required are not finding permanent homes for children are not 
providing family services that could prevent the need for foster 
care 
access to adoption is a cruel hoax it doesnt exist for most 
of these kids she said largely because states are very slow to 
move in that direction by then the kids are so old and so 
damaged by their experiences that they become very hard to place 
she said 
lowry also cited the troubling results of a kansas city review 
of 25 foster care cases chosen randomly she said 25 percent of 
the children had been abused or inappropriately punished and 88 
percent of the reports were not properly investigated 
this amazing result violates the states own procedures as 
well as a consent decree and sections of two us laws she said 
boyd described several instances of physical abuse and other 
problems including his placement with a spanishspeaking woman 
with whom he could not communicate another foster care veteran 
daryl morris of houston said he was in six homes before finding a 
family with whom he spent five years 
ive had to deal with rejection all of my life said morris 
now 18 and a high school senior its hard living with different 
people and being moved from one place to another while we were 
never physically abused this was mental abuse the scars go 
away from your body but not from your mind

a report prepared for the nations roman 
catholic bishops urges them to stick by their conditional 
acceptance of defensive nuclear weapons but questions president 
reagans star wars program the national catholic reporter says 
a committee headed by cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago was 
to have submitted the report on its study of morality and nuclear 
deterrence during the annual meeting of the national conference of 
catholic bishops in washington last november 
however bernardin announced then that the report was being 
postponed until spring so the bishops could assess the impact of 
the arms control summit meeting at washington in december 
editor thomas fox of the national catholic reporter in an 
article published in the weekly newspapers april 15 edition said 
the ad hoc committee report was approved by the bishops 
administrative board at a meeting in washington last month and will 
be debated by the full body of bishops in june 
the communications office at the archdiocese of chicago said no 
one was available wednesday for comment on the report 
the newspaper said the 63page committee report contains a 
1000word pastoral message a review of the 1983 challenge of 
peace pastoral a look at arms negotiations between the 
superpowers in recent years and an analysis of arms race advances 
we are persuaded to renew the judgment of the challenge of 
peace that nuclear deterrence merits only strictly conditioned 
acceptance the newspaper quoted the report as saying in a 
dangerous world a world of both widespread nuclear knowledge and 
extensive nuclear arsenals we find condemning nuclear deterence 
too drastic a solution and embracing it too simple a response 
we believe that strictly conditioned acceptance is the 
judgment most appropriate for urging countries particularly our 
own to plan for and to pursue bilateral and multilateral arms 
control and to move toward progressive disarmament 
the 1983 pastoral did not address the reagan administrations 
strategic defense initiative or star wars policy since it was 
announced shortly before the bishops released their letter 
according to the reporter the new report questions the wisdom 
of star wars saying that while the goal of a defensive system may 
sound attractive it poses a collective danger and leaves us 
unconvinced of the merits of proceeding toward deployment 
once it is clear that intentions must be measured against 
possible consequences a morally adequate moral framework exists 
for the policy debate on sdi the report was quoted as saying 
some critics members of the bishops conference among them have 
criticized even conditional acceptance of nuclear deterrence for 
example auxiliary bishop p francis murphy of baltimore called 
last year for withdrawal of that acceptance saying it provided a 
moral loophole for the nuclear arms race to continue 
in an editoral the reporter criticized the committee report as 
a technical document lacking encouragment for new energy in the 
long and often lonely work of peacemaking

environmental protection agency administrator 
lee thomas said wednesday he backed efforts in congress to better 
regulate cities incinerator ash as local officials complained 
that current waste standards are unclear 
thomas told a house energy and commerce subcommittee that he 
supported the approach of a bill by reps thomas luken dohio 
that seeks to end confusion over the handling of ash from 140 
municipal waste combustors processing about 15 million tons of 
refuse each year 
at issue is whether incinerator ash is to be considered 
hazardous or nonhazardous solid waste thomas said epa is looking 
to congress for help on whether ash from wastetoenergy 
incinerators should be exempt from stringent hazardous waste 
regulations that could mean high cost and lots of paperwork for 
communities 
currently the determination of whether a waste is considered 
hazardous is based on toxicity tests 
but confusion over the tests for example how to handle the 
varying levels of toxicity in bottom ash versus fly ash has 
spawned lawsuits and garbagehandling problems have mounted 
ordinarily municipal officials as im sure you well know 
resist and resent endless federal mandates said beulah 
coughenour a city council member in indianapolis who spoke on 
behalf of the national league of cities 
this time we come before you from the opposite perspective we 
are here to ask for exactly that federal intervention in an area 
that is uniquely a local government responsibility coughenour 
said 
carrie s perry mayor of hartford conn urged the panel to 
pass ash legislation that provides more clear direction to public 
jurisdictions currently facing waste disposal crises 
with room for exceptions lukens bill would place incinerator 
ash under nonhazardous waste regulations and give states the lead 
in enforcing the bills requirements 
epa however would be directed to write new regulations for 
operating solid waste incinerators and to develop a new test for 
ash residue 
thomas said legislative action was needed and the approach 
subcommittee chairman luken has proposed seems to me to be on the 
right track

none of the mainline us antitank weapons 
would work against soviet tanks because the soviet union is so far 
ahead of the united states in producing topgrade armor congress 
was told wednesday 
in addition soviet weapons likely would destroy a large part of 
americas armored force of tanks and bradley fighting vehicles 
during the first stages of any war retired army gen donn starry 
told a senate armed services subcommittee 
starry retired last year as commander of the armys training and 
doctrine command where he specialized in armor systems 
three years ago a pentagon defense science board concluded not 
only that the soviet union had the edge over the united states both 
in armored protection and in defeating armored protection but that 
the gap was growing worse 
the situation is now a matter of considerable national 
urgency starry said 
army officials who testified along with starry before the armed 
services conventional forces subcommittee wednesday agreed with 
him although their assessments were not as quite gloomy 
the army agreed with the dsb conclusions in 1985 and still 
agrees with the conclusion that we are behind the soviets said 
lt gen donald s pihl deputy to the assistant secretary of the 
army for research and development we need to regain the lead and 
maintain that advantage 
the soviet union has about a 3to1 numerical advantage in 
tanks but us officials have long contended that many of the 
soviet tanks are far older than the modern tanks fielded in europe 
by the united states and its nato allies 
in addition the united states and other nato armies have tens 
of thousands of antitank missiles such as the dragon several 
varieties of the tow weapon and the topoftheline hellfire 
missile carried by the apache antitank helicopter 
senators were surprised by starrys assessment 
are you including hellfire asked sen william cohen 
rmaine 
yes starry said 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of the subcommittee asked 
are you saying that if we went to war our bullets and missiles 
would bounce off soviet tanks 
thats correct starry said 
starry said the soviets are fielding a series of tank armors 
made of glass and ceramic composites atop those armor platings 
the soviets are putting a series of applique boxes which 
contain specially designed explosives that blow up when the armor 
is hit by an incoming missile the explosion on the applique box 
draws off the explosive energy of the incoming weapon and renders 
it less powerful 
the applique boxes were first fielded by the israelis about 10 
years ago starry noted and were first used in combat during 
israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
the unhappy fact is that tanks with reactive armor on top of 
builtin glass composite or ceramic laminate armor will quite 
likely defeat the warheads of all deployed weapons used by 
western forces he said 
starry also said the soviets have more effective antitank 
weapons meaning they likely would take a high toll among us 
tanks during the early stages of any war 
last month army officials unveiled a plan to improve the armor 
on the main us battle the m1a1 abrams by using depleted 
uranium 
at the time army officials said in a statement that move was 
a significant enhancement of us armor capabilities and would 
allow the abrams to meet the anticipated threat well into the 
1990s 
asked about that assertion starry declined comment in open 
session but speaking later with reporters he said its too 
early to tell how effective it will be 
the soviet advantage combined with the new ussoviet treaty 
that will eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles from europe 
poses a grave danger starry said 
the soviets obviously believe that they now have the means to 
execute the operational concept they have embraced for so long 
achieve quick decisive victory at theater level of war and do so 
with such thoroughness and dispatch that the nuclear decision in 
the west is yet in abeyance even as they consolidate their theater 
level gains

india has been given approval to buy 12 
million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said india will be 
allowed to buy the grain under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep it is the first time india has been eligible to 
buy subsidized wheat under the program although vegetable oil has 
been made available 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under eep arrangements exporters can sell specified us 
commodities to designated countries at reduced prices in order to 
meet foreign competition and then collect free government surpluses 
of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
subsidies have ranged from less than 20 to more than 40 per 
ton of wheat or in the range of 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
the soviet union also has been a big buyer of us wheat under 
eep with purchases totaling more than 118 million tons in the 
last year and china has bought more than 5 million tons under the 
program

gov michael dukakis responding to campaign 
criticism from democratic presidential opponent albert gore jr 
said wednesday that as president he might use nuclear forces but he 
refused to elaborate 
the policy i advocated has been the policy of the government 
of the united states for many many years its the policy of the 
nato alliance dukakis said at a boston press conference 
if senator gore wants to take issue with that policy he 
should do so but he ought to get his facts straight dukakis 
added 
he was responding to criticism from gore who told an audience 
in new york earlier in the day that it was unwise and 
irresponsible for dukakis to suggest that he would use nuclear 
forces to repel a soviet invasion of europe 
dukakis and his aides insisted that gore was distorting his 
comments 
and dukakis dismissed gores criticism insisting that his 
position on nuclear weapons was the same as the policy of every 
us president in the nuclear era 
the governor said he would consider the use of nuclear forces as 
an option in the event of a soviet invasion of europe but he 
refused to spell out the exact circumstances under which he would 
definitely use nuclear weapons 
dukakis was asked specifically how he would respond as president 
if soviet ground forces overwhelmed western troops in europe 
we have always reserved the right to use nuclear force under 
those circumstances thats not saying were going to do it but we 
have always reserved the right to do so that has been the policy 
of our government it is the policy of the nato alliance the 
governor said 
jack corrigan the deputy manager of the dukakis campaign was 
more blunt in his reaction to gores comments 
senator gore is shooting from the hip in an act of political 
desperation corrigan said were just lucky that hes only in 
charge of his mouth and not in charge of the button 
gore who is competing with dukakis and rev jesse jackson in 
next weeks new york primary said that traditionally candidates 
and presidents avoid the trap of spelling out in advance when 
the united states would use nuclear weapons 
one of my opponents said in an interview yesterday that he 
would launch a nuclear first strike against the soviet union if 
they invaded europe with conventional forces gore said dukakis 
did not use the phrase first strike 
in a key passage of the daily news interview dukakis said 
im for a policy of no early first use but our present strategy 
in europe assumes that if the soviets were to invade and 
conventional forces couldnt stop them that wed reserve the right 
to use nuclear force i dont think thats going to happen and in 
fact i see the opposite happening i see a real opportunity now to 
bring down the level of conventional forces with the soviets i 
think gorbachev is serious about his need to significantly reduce 
his commitment of conventional forces so i dont think its going 
to happen but until that happens weve got to be prepared to use 
nuclear force obviously with great restraint and only when there 
seems to be no other alternative

the reagan administration came under attack 
wednesday for taking four years to implement a 1984 law intended to 
reduce sharply the number of dolphins killed by tuna fishing in the 
eastern pacific 
this is an embarrassment sen john breaux dla said at a 
senate commerce committee hearing that also heard similar criticism 
from conservation groups and the us tuna industry 
drawing the fire was the national marine fisheries service 
which is the national oceanic and atmospheric administration agency 
charged with carrying out a congressional order to deny foreign 
nations access to the us tuna market if their fishing boats dont 
reduce their dolphin kills 
the foreign tuna fleet in the eastern tropical pacific is 
killing over 100000 dolphins a year and our government agencies 
have done little to implement the 1984 changes designed to address 
the problem sen john kerry dmass said 
the 1984 law was designed to put teeth into the marine mammal 
protection act enacted in 1972 to minimize the number of dolphins 
killed by an international tuna industry that switched in the late 
1950s from baited hooks to huge seines 
for reasons unclear to biologists yellowfin tuna congregate 
beneath groups of surfaceswimming dolphins which serve as tuna 
markers to fishing boats conservationists estimate that some 6 
million of the mammals have drowned over the years after being 
snared in tuna nets 
because of improved seining techniques the number of kills by 
us tuna boats has dropped from 368000 in 1972 to 13992 the 
hearing was told foreign kills reportedly fell from 423678 in 
1972 to an estimated maximum of 82000 last year compared with 
108767 in 1986 and 37505 in 1985 
william fox a member of the marine mammal commission said 
we face a serious situation in the tropical pacific fox said 
preliminary findings from a dolphin census show some stocks are 
smaller than thought and others are declining 
it was not until recently that the fisheries service published 
regulations to carry out the 1984 law the plan would give foreign 
tuna fleets until 1991 to match the performance of the us fleet 
which is allowed to kill up to 20500 dolphins a year 
why are we waiting until 1991 said sen pete wilson 
rcalif i think we should pursue why it will take until 1991 to 
impose these import restrictions 
james douglas noaas acting assistant administrator for 
fisheries said were not particularly proud of the amount of 
time it took to do these regulations 
he said regulators were walking a tightrope wanting to foster a 
reduction in foreign fleet dolphin kills but not wanting to cause 
other nations to forgo the us market sell their tuna elsewhere 
and not adopt techniques to save dolphins 
david burney general counsel of the us tuna foundation an 
industry group said foreign tuna fleets should be required to 
adopt us methods there is no excuse for them not having done 
that he said it should have been done three years ago

the senate energy committee approved 
legislation wednesday that supporters say would spur development of 
slurry pipelines to transport coal from mines to markets 
the bill endorsed 106 is the latest attempt in a 10year 
effort by sen bennett johnston dla and others to get a 
coalslurry proposal though congress 
the legislation would give coal pipeline developers a federal 
right of eminent domain the legal authority to force landowners to 
sell them property for a pipelines rightofway 
supporters of the bill say that mixing coal with water or other 
substances and shipping it through a pipeline would save 
transportation costs and make the fuel more competitive with 
foreign coal 
the railroad industry has opposed such proposals in the past 
saying that if it loses coal business it would have to charge 
higher shipping rates for other commodities 
as an inducement to the railroads the committee voted 108 for 
an amendment that would repeal the law that prohibits railroads 
from owning coal leases on federal land

us marines tightened security at a 
sprawling military fuel depot on wednesday after claiming they had 
repelled 40 to 50 intruders in a twohour firefight the night 
before 
it was the second time in two days that us military officials 
had reported an intrusion at the depot and wednesdays report 
seemed sure to worsen already bitter relations between the united 
states and the government controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega 
panamanian officials scoffed at the latest account suggesting 
it was the product of fear and imagination on the part of 
inexperienced edgy american troops 
that is their version and nothing more said martin alberto 
paz a spokesman for the panamanian defense forces the 15000man 
military and police unit that is the source of noriegas power 
it seems they are trying to create confusion paz added 
its the first time that the gringos dont know whos shooting 
at them 
col ron sconyers spokesman for the us southern command said 
there were no apparent injuries in the latest incident at the 
underground petroleum storage facility at howard air force base 
sconyers said he could neither confirm nor deny that the 
intruders were penamanian military personnel but said all were 
reported wearing dark uniforms 
noriega is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges for months he has successfully resisted 
efforts by the internal opposition and washington to oust him 
us officials said the clash took place at the arraijan tank 
farm an 800acre reserve near panama city where a marine sentry 
was shot to death monday night while investigating what was 
described as a breakin by six to eight camouflaged intruders he 
was apparently shot accidentally by another marine us officials 
said 
sconyers said the latest incident involved about 100 marines it 
began he said when a 12man marine patrol reported receiving 
fire at about 735 pm tuesday 835 pm edt from a location 
where they had observed an estimated 40 to 50 unauthorized 
personnel 
the marines returned the fire sporadic firing continued for 
about two hours sconyers said 
he said the patrol called in reinforcements who exchanged small 
arms fire with the intruders fired three high explosive mortar 
rounds at their positions and illuminated the area with flares 
helicopters with searchlights were dispatched 
despite the intensity of the battle marines who swept the area 
after daylight found no evidence of injuries and no equipment the 
intruders may have left behind sconyers said 
the colonel said the estimate of 40 to 50 intruders was made by 
an unidentified marine captain at the scene tuesday but added 
this is a very very thick canopied jungle area so its very 
difficult to make exact assessments at any point in time even in 
daylight 
sconyers said the patrol first sighted the intruders at dusk 
about an hour and a half before the fight began and later kept 
them under surveillance with night detection devices 
asked why the intruders were not stopped when first sighted 
sconyers said they were not into an area at that point that 
necessitated that action and after the firefight broke out there 
were no prisoners taken 
sconyers described the fuel dump as partially fenced in and 
very heavily traversed by local residents he said that us 
soldiers could not tell whether the intruders were armed when they 
first spotted them 
the only reason now that we know in fact they were armed is 
because we heard gunshots and there were muzzle flashes the 
colonel said 
a pentagon spokesman dan howard suggested in washington 
tuesday that the shooting death of a marine guard at the fuel dump 
monday may have been provoked by panamanian defense forces 
personnel 
howard said the victim apparently was shot accidentally by 
fellow marine guards but cited what he described as a series of 
intrusions in recent weeks by individuals who were uniformed and 
camouflaged 
the panamanian government rejected the accusations

a timid 450pound black bear named 
thor has awakened from his winter slumber in the back yard of a 
suburban home unaware that hes been banished by municipal 
officials to a home outside city limits 
hes very gentle owner charles crosby said one time when 
he was out he saw a little poodle that was walking down the 
street well he just turned right around and hightailed it back 
to the house 
the city council originally wanted to move thor out last fall 
but crosby said he wasnt willing to wake him from his hibernation 
for fear of raising the snoozing bruins ire 
thats something i really wouldnt want to do crosby said 
the council delayed the move while the 6foot animal hibernated 
in his concrete den in the back yard this spring the councils 
april 15 deadline was extended once again giving crosby and his 
wife 30 more days to finish a new home a log cabin outside this 
twin cities suburb 
crosby said he and his wife had planned to move before the 
council decided that thor had to leave but adds that he would have 
fought the decision if they wanted to stay because they went 
through all the proper channels when they got the bear 
crosby purchased thor from a game farm three years ago when he 
was 5 weeks old getting up as much as four times a night to feed 
him with a baby bottle before bringing the bear home crosby said 
he checked state and city laws and obtained a special license from 
the department of natural resources 
but that was before the bloomington city council passed an 
ordinance that went into effect a year ago forbidding wild animals 
from being kept in the city someone complained about thor and 
that was that 
we used to take him for walks around the neighborhood but now 
he gets about two houses away and wont go any further he wants to 
come back home crosby said 
still the crosbys are optimistic that thor will take to his new 
home deborah crosby said the cabin is situated on 12 acres and 
thor will have a large cage that has trees in it and a pond to swim 
in she said 
ardie oberstar who lives next to the crosbys said shell miss 
thor we love the bear we never worried about him hes very 
gentle 
crosby said he and thor like to wrestle but if thor gets too 
carried away he knows how to stop him 
hes real ticklish on his stomach when i start tickling him 
he rolls over and shakes crosby said his ears go back and it 
looks like hes laughing

former head of the black political group says he doesnt think 
jackson will win the white house 
some time in the future its possible a black can win 
birmingham mayor richard arrington said tuesday 
but i do not think jackson can win partly because he carries 
a lot of baggage among whites as a civil rights leader this is not 
to say anything negative about jackson this is a negative comment 
on where america is 
in 1987 the new south coalition then headed by arrington 
endorsed jackson for the democratic nomination 
but arrington the first black mayor of alabamas largest city 
said jacksons recent successes are now backfiring 
now that he has become such a force were seeing a stop jesse 
movement he said i think initially it came out of the party 
itself which tossed the ball to the media and now youll see more

democrats put a black on their ticket for the november election has 
prompted a flood of telephone calls from party leaders who disagree

his earlier suggestion to columnist mary mcgrory that the democrats 
should select jesse jackson or another black to run for vice 
president if massachusetts gov michael s dukakis is the 
presidential nominee 
flynn said the party should do that even if that means we lose 
the election id rather see the democrats lose than win without 
a black on the ticket 
they have put their time and hard work into the party and have 
gotten very little in return he said having a black on the 
ticket would help reunite this country more so than any piece of 
legislation 
flynn declined to identify party leaders who called to disagree 
with him but said he understands why others believe we should 
win at all costs but im talking from my gut instincts 
democratic national chairman paul kirk in a statement from 
spokeswoman julie anbender said whatever combination of 
candidates has the best chance of winning will be chosen the color 
of their skin is not what matters

an airliner landed on the wrong runway at londons 
gatwick airport forcing a boeing 737 carrying 119 people to swerve 
into the mud to avoid a crash authorities said wednesday 
an air traffic controller spotted the potential danger and 
prevented a collision the civil aviation authority said the 336 
people aboard the two planes were unharmed it said 
the incident happened tuesday about 1020 pm 520 pm edt 
when a british island airways bac111 carrying 117 people was 
arriving from venice italy 
at gatwick about 25 miles south of london a british airways 
boeing 737 with 119 people was moving along a taxiway toward the 
runway for takeoff to the greek island of rhodes 
instead of landing on the runway the incoming aircraft headed 
toward the adjacent taxiway when the tower notified the jet of the 
error the landing jet threw its engines into reverse and stopped 
about 750 feet short of a collision said an aviation authority 
spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
at the same time the british airways plane which was moving 
slowly swerved off the tarmac and came to a stop in the mud and 
grass beside the runway he said 
the aviation authority launched an inquiry and provided no 
immediate explanation for the neardisastrous error but gatwicks 
sole runway had been closed overnight for repaving and the 
adjacent taxiway was being used as a temporary runway 
airport managers praised the traffic controllers alertness in 
preventing an incident becoming an accident a gatwick airport 
spokesman said he also commended the british airways pilot for 
responding quickly and positively 
the 1300strong guild of air pilots and air navigators said the 
incident highlighted the dangers of having just one runway at 
gatwick 
the worry lies in the fact that the british airports authority 
gatwicks operator are digging up the main runway at one of the 
busiest times of the year said the organizations clerk capt 
paul wilson

a senior citizens lobby said wednesday it has 
sued the government to force it to credit 585 billion in wages to 
individuals social security accounts 
the national committee to preserve social security and medicare 
said it was unsatisfied with the governments efforts to resolve 
the discrepancies which has been costing some retirees an average 
of 17 a month 
john trollinger a spokesman for the social security 
administration said he had not seen the lawsuit and would have no 
comment but he said the administration is improving and making 
changes in the way we gather this wage information so that the 
discrepancies will be kept to an absolute minimum were 
working very diligently with the irs to resolve disrepancies from 
the past 
former congressman james roosevelt the chairman of the lobbying 
group said in a statement although the government has known 
about this problem for years its response has been wholly 
inadequate 
the problem arose after the government switched to a dual system 
for reporting employee earnings in 1978 since then employers have 
sent one set of employee earnings reports to the irs and another to 
the social security administration 
according to the general accounting office approximately 585 
billion in wages has not been properly credited to social security 
accounts from 1978 through 1984 nearly 97 million people 
including active workers and those now retired had some earnings 
that were erroneously omitted from their records 
the gao said that in a sample of cases it reviewed the typical 
retiree whose wage record was not up to date had lost an average of 
1681 a month for 31 months 
roosevelt said the discrepant reports were continuing to pile up 
at the rate of 500000 or more a year and employers are only 
required by law to retain employee wage records for four years 
the social security administration urges all workers to check 
their wage records every three years to make sure their wages were 
reported correctly they can fill out a form and receive a printout 
of past years wages credited for social security and compare that 
with their own wage records 
the group said it filed the lawsuit tuesday in us district 
court in washington

the federal government plans to write off or 
defer payment on a total of 88 billion in debt owed by farmers to 
the farmers home administration the agencys administrator said 
wednesday 
it is true that we are probably writing off upwards of 8 
billion to 9 billion over the next couple of years and the 
agricultural credit act is responsible for a substantial portion of 
that fmha administrator vance clark told a senate hearing 
the disclosure followed unconfirmed reports last month that the 
government might write off as much as 7 billion in debt under 
provisions of a bailout bill for the farm credit system that was 
passed by congress last year 
a farm lawmaker sen charles grassley riowa immediately 
criticized clark for saying the farm credit act was responsible for 
the substantial loss to the federal government 
farm legislators have been sensitive to complaints that 
taxpayers are footing too high a bill for subsidies to keep farmers 
afloat grassley said he wanted to head off any such statements in 
this case 
fmha said in specific it is writing down or deferring 
payment on 21 billion in debts to improve the cash flow of 
farmers who cannot pay their debts at the moment in such cases 
the government hopes eventually to recapture the amount owed 
it said it would simply write off 67 billion in debt of 
farmers who would not be able to achieve a blackink cash flow even 
if their debt were written down 
grassley noted that the farm credit act allows such actions only 
if they would cost the government less than foreclosing on 
debtburdened farmers 
a substantial amount of debt piled up in the early 1980s when 
many farmers found themselves overinvested in farmland amid a 
nosedive in peracre prices many such producers had borrowed 
heavily to acquire the land and could not achieve sufficient cash 
flow to make payments amid a general stagnation in the farm economy 
theyre including costs that would have been there even if 
congress had not passed the bill grassley said following the 
hearing 
he said that was true because the legislation had as a key 
test whether foreclosure and restructuring would best benefit the 
federal treasury 
thats a very objective bottom line decision that really means 
that what congress passed isnt costing the federal government 
anything he said grassley also said that regulations have not 
been written and thus it is not possible to say exactly how much 
money is involved

scientists have found small residues of a 
potentially cancercausing animal drug in milk being sold in 10 
us cities a food and drug administration official said wednesday 
the drug sulfamethazine is approved for use in pork and beef 
cattle feed but is not supposed to be used in dairy cattle feed 
the levels we were finding in milk should not cause a public 
health problem but we are concerned because this is an illegal use 
and that drug must not be used in dairy cattle gerald guest 
head of the agencys center for veterinary medicine said in a 
statement 
we have been meeting with the appropriate industry groups and 
they already have programs under way to communicate this concern to 
their respective industries guest said the message is that 
sulfamethazine should not be used on dairy cattle 
fda spokesman chris lecos said the contaminated milk samples 
were taken in early march as part of an fda program to develop a 
simple and effective test that dairies can use to make sure they 
are not buying contaminated milk 
he said it was a small sampling exercise to evaluate an onsite 
milk testing technique that fda scientists believe is nearly ready 
for widespread use in detecting prohibited use of the drug in dairy 
cattle 
fda officials conducting the survey bought pasteurized whole 
milk from five grocery stores in each of the 10 cities boston 
baltimore atlanta dallas chicago kansas city denver san 
francisco seattle and new york 
of the 49 samples 36 showed some sign of the drug lecos said 
of the 36 he added only five were above trace levels 
there is no reason for the public to be concerned about the 
safety of the milk lecos said the point is we dont want to 
find it sulfamethazine in milk at all 
the effort to develop a quick and accurate test for milk 
contamination comes as the fda is conducting a larger review of 
whether sulfamethazine which has been used since the late 1950s 
to treat respiratory disease in food animals should be banned 
outright 
fda commissioner frank e young met with manufacturers of the 
drug last month to discuss the review and has convened a twoday 
hearing next month to further study the issue 
fda studies have suggested that sulfamethazine used in the feed 
of an estimated 80 percent of all hogs marketed in the united 
states can cause cancer in mice 
the agency decision to reopen the question of whether the drug 
should be allowed at all stems from those recent studies coupled 
with improved onsite agriculture department pork testing methods 
that suggest higher levels are reaching the market than earlier 
detection methods revealed

the sailor accused of killing 
the uss john hancocks payroll officer and stealing 94000 
reported for duty as usual each day since the crime a month ago 
navy investigators said 
petty officer 1st class ruben colon a 14year navy veteran was 
in the brig wednesday after being arrested aboard the ship the 
previous day on a charge of murder and theft 
the navy said 94629 in cash plus blank us treasury checks 
were stolen from the ships payroll office on tuesday 
investigators found 89000 in cash as well as blank checks in a 
bank safe deposit box rented by colon 
because visits on ships such as the hancock are tightly 
restricted authorities had suspected the killer might be among the 
320 officers and sailors aboard the destroyer 
lt jg ratish prasad 24 was shot and choked before his body 
was shoved into a storage area of the ship in the early morning 
hours of march 15 a payday for the sailors aboard the hancock 
colon 34 was confined wednesday in the navy brig at 
jacksonville naval air station said david l brant special agent 
in charge of the naval investigative service office at mayport the 
killing occurred while the ship was docked at mayport 
colon of vega baja puerto rico has been assigned to the 
hancock since 1984 and worked as a career counselor brant said 
colon had reported for duty regularly since the killing 
colon will be arraigned by the end of the week and later a 
military board similar to a civilian grand jury will convene to 
determine what formal charges would be brought brant said no 
hearing dates have been set 
if colon is charged with premeditated murder and convicted in 
military court he could face the death penalty brant said 
investigators refused to disclose what led them to colon but 
brant said nis and fbi agents obtained a search warrant tuesday for 
a safe deposit box rented in colons name at a bank in jacksonville 
agents recovered 89000 in cash plus most or all of the 
missing blank us treasury checks and colon was soon arrested 
brant said 
this is the most intensive investigation undertaken by this 
office brant said weve been working on this case for nearly 
four weeks and more than 40 agents from nis and the fbi have been 
involved 
prasad the only son of indianborn parents enlisted in the 
navy in april 1985 and had been stationed on the hancock since may

lawyers police officers and new york city 
officials on wednesday endorsed a bill aimed at giving american 
citizens greater protection against crimes committed by foreign 
diplomats and dependents who are immune from arrest or prosecution 
the passage of this bill will send a clear message to those 
lawbreakers who know our hands have been tied by the present laws 
that they will no longer be able to wave a paper called diplomatic 
immunity and walk away scotfree said dennis ray martin deputy 
sheriff of saginaw county in michigan and president of the 
68000member american federation of police 
the state department said recently that from august 1982 through 
last february there were 147 criminal incidents in the washington 
area involving foreign diplomats their staffs or dependents the 
violations mostly involved shoplifting but also included murder 
rape and assault 
during the same period 44 diplomatic crimes were reported in 
the new york metropolitan area 
under an international agreement which was approved by the 
senate in 1965 and implemented in 1978 ambassadors and other 
diplomats and their family members enjoy complete immunity from 
criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits but various exceptions are 
made for lesser personnel 
the bill sponsored chiefly by rep stephen j solarz dny 
would provide federal assistance to the 37 states that have funds 
for compensating crime victims if they extend eligibility to 
victims of diplomatic crimes 
the measure would put congress on record as favoring state 
department action to obtain waivers of diplomatic immunity or the 
forced departure of diplomats who are charged with serious crimes 
the state department would be required to publish an annual list 
of the names and countries of diplomats who have violated us 
laws and to cooperate more closely with us immigration 
authorities in barring reentry of those who have returned home 
the department would be barred from hindering a state or local 
criminal investigation or prosecution of a diplomatic crime 
where immunity is not involved the bill also calls for the 
president to study ways to prevent diplomatic pouches from being 
used to smuggle arms or illicit narcotics into the united states 
the state department said recently that it generally supports 
the draft legislation but objects to several provisions as 
unnecessary or potentially harmful to us relations with other 
countries 
at a hearing by the house foreign affairs subcommittee on 
international operations the bill won qualified endorsement from 
steven stein chairman of the new york city bar associations 
committee on international law and gillian sorensen the new york 
city commissioner responsible for liaison with the 35000 foreign 
diplomats staff members and dependents in the new york area 
stein said the victims compensation provision may be the most 
important part of the bill he suggested creation of a federal 
compensation fund to reimburse victims of diplomatic crimes in 
states where assistance is lacking

commercial space launching will 
develop into an important industry in the 1990s and competition 
may include the soviet union a us department of transportation 
official said wednesday 
i think we will see innovation in the commercial space 
industry courtney stadd director of dots commercial 
transportation office told about 400 space industry workers at the 
fourth national space symposium here there is some advantage to 
taking private spaceports seriously 
dot as a result of the commercial space launch act of 1984 has 
a mandate to define and regulate commercial space efforts 
stadd said dots role is to encourage a competitive and 
diverse launch industry and to regulate efficiently to ensure 
safe and reponsible launch activities 
the scope of the space industry is expanding with the start of 
competition in the commercial launch field and the soviet union 
may become one of the bidders stadd said he added that he does 
not see the soviets as an active competitor in the near future 
commercial space launch was born in the era in which the us 
government concentrated its spending on the space shuttle program 
when the challenger explosion and us rocket failures created a 
large backlog of commercial payloads japan china and france began 
competing for us launching business 
the concept of commercial launch competition has brought up new 
issues stadd said the major problem being worked out is how to 
allocate launching facilities among government agencies and private 
corporations

rare criminal misconduct charges have been filed 
against two former social workers in the deaths of two abused 
children whose cases they monitored 
the charges against hattie roland 37 and diane henton 35 
should send a message to social workers that the states 
attorneys office will be reviewing their work to protect all the 
children of this county said richard daley the cook county 
prosecutor 
the two women who had been fired by the illinois department of 
children and family services last year were indicted by a county 
grand jury tuesday 
ms roland is accused of falsely claiming she visited a home and 
ms henton is accused of failing to report apparent abuse said 
lisa howard a spokeswoman for daley 
the women are to enter pleas at a hearing thursday daley said 
tuesday they were the first indictments of their kind to be brought 
against social workers in the state 
howard davidson director of the american bar association child 
advocacy center in washington said wednesday criminal charges have 
been filed in rare instances but civil suits are much more common 
because criminal convictions are difficult to obtain 
dcfs director gordon johnson said wednesday that heavy 
childabuse caseloads especially in chicago may make it 
impossible for caseworkers to make the recommended onceamonth 
visits 
the question is lying about it johnson said those 
individuals who dont tell the truth about providing services 
should be fired 
the job just cannot be done said barry friedman president 
of local 2081 of the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees youre out there and if you make the wrong 
decision youre going to be blamed as a babykiller 
ms roland was indicted on 63 counts of misconduct including 
allegedly falsifying reports ms howard said 
she is accused of reporting nine visits to the home of debra 
hardy between february 1983 and june 1984 that she never made 
ms hardy was convicted of murder in december for the 1984 
strangling of her 4monthold son and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison 
ms henton was charged with eight counts of misconduct 
including failing to report the abuse of jonathan campbell the 
child was killed jan 25 1986 his first birthday six days 
after ms henton closed the case after a home visit 
an autopsy report said the childs ears were nearly torn off and 
he had 25 or more bruises on his body many at least 10 days old 
anthony habener a friend of the childs mother was convicted 
of murder last september and sentenced to 65 years in prison 
the two women face up to five years on each count of misconduct 
if convicted 
both defendants who had supervised other dcfs caseworkers were 
fired after an internal investigation accused them of misconduct in 
the babies deaths johnson said six other supervisors from the 
departments chicago office also were fired transferred or 
suspended at that time 
civil service officials overturned ms rolands dismissal on 
appeal and ordered a 120day suspension said dave schneidman a 
dcfs spokesman that suspension has expired but ms roland has not 
returned to work and the department would seek to block any attempt 
by her to do so he said 
ms henton has accepted her dismissal schneidman said 
the average caseload for state workers who investigate reports 
of abuse is about 45 dcfs spokeswoman jo warfield said wednesday 
it is expected to rise to 48 by next year despite an increase in 
the work force she said forty cases would be manageable and 30 
would be ideal she added 
in chicago the caseload is as high as 60 or 80 johnson said 
we can point fingers but the problem is that we just dont 
have enough money he said 
the number of child abuse and neglect reports has been exploding 
in recent years because of economic frustration better reporting 
procedures and more public awareness warfield said childabuse 
reports rose to 91723 in fiscal 1987 from 6700 in fiscal 1976

eastern airlines was accused in a lawsuit 
wednesday of violating a labor contract by using company planes to 
train nonunion flight attendants to serve passengers in the event 
of a possible strike 
the suit by the union that represents eastern flight attendants 
is the latest in a series of challenges to the laborrelations 
policies of texas air corp which bought financially troubled 
eastern in 1986 
the transport workers union of america local 553 charged that 
eastern planes are being used by orion lift services inc an 
independent cargo airline to train nonunion flight attendants 
last month eastern lost a similar suit involving the training 
of nonunion pilots on its aircraft by orion 
the transport workers union charged that the training of flight 
attendants violates its contract with eastern 
telephone calls to eastern headquarters in miami went unanswered 
wednesday evening 
last month us district judge barrington parker ordered 
eastern to stop allowing orion to use easterns planes to train 
nonunion pilots 
orion which is based in raleigh nc has a contract with 
eastern to train flight attendants and pilots to fly the passenger 
carriers aircraft in the event of a threatened strike this spring 
by 13000 members of the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers 
the flight attendants suit was assigned to parker who 
determined that the pilot training constitutes a unilateral 
repudiation of the collective bargaining agreement eastern had 
with the air line pilots association 
eastern also suffered another legal setback last month when 
another federal judge in washington held the company in contempt of 
court for taking steps to sell its northeast shuttle operation to 
another subsidiary of texas air 
us district judge john h pratt threatened to fine eastern 
10000 a day unless it stopped all efforts to complete the 
transaction which he said violated the terms of an injunction he 
had issued last year in another labor dispute 
the company agreed to comply with pratts order to purge itself 
of the contempt citation and avoid the fines

the house gave final congressional approval 
wednesday to legislation awarding the states title to abandoned 
historic shipwrecks lying within their waters after rejecting a 
proposal to guarantee access to wrecks by sport divers and salvage 
operators 
by a 34064 vote the house passed and sent to the white house 
for president reagans signature the same measure it narrowly 
rejected two weeks ago when opponents complained they were denied 
the opportunity to offer amendments to the bill 
the bill was brought up again wednesday under different 
parliamentary ground rules that allowed consideration of 
amendments but the major proposed change the access guarantee 
sought by rep norman d shumway rcalif in behalf of sport 
divers and salvors was defeated on a 268134 roll call 
shumways adversaries had warned that approval of any amendments 
would require sending the bill back to the senate where they said 
the measure almost certainly would die shumway dismissed the 
warnings as scare tactics but the measure cleared the house 
without any changes 
before the final vote the house rejected 221183 an amendment 
by rep robert s walker rpa that would have required the 
states to give federal law enforcement agencies freedom to pursue 
drug smugglers into state coastal waters 
it also defeated by voice vote another shumway proposal to limit 
coverage to wrecks listed on or eligible for the national 
register of historic places 
the measure wouuld give states title to the estimated 5 percent 
to 10 percent of the shipwrecks in state waters that are considered 
historically important all others having no historic interest 
plus all shipwrecks lying beyond three miles offshore would be 
governed by federal admiralty law 
admiralty law awards shipwrecks and cargoes to the finders and 
permits salvage operators to claim a major portion of the cargoes 
they raise 
under the bill admiralty law would not apply to the small 
number of historically significant shipwrecks in state waters and 
indian tribes would have title to shipwrecks on their lands the 
federal government would retain title to any abandoned wrecks on 
public lands 
until now both states and federal admiralty courts have claimed 
jurisdiction over such wrecks in state waters 
the submerged lands act of 1953 gave the states ownership of all 
natural resources and submerged lands up to three miles offshore 
but did not cover manmade objects on those lands 
the house had defeated the measure march 29 by a 263139 margin 
five votes short of the twothirds majority required for passage 
under ground rules for accelerated debate with no amendments the 
rules in effect wednesday required only a simple majority for 
passage 
the bill passed the senate by voice vote on dec 19 
rep jack fields rtexas who supported the shumway amendment 
said he would urge the president to veto the bill unless it 
guaranteed the nations 4 million sport divers and latterday 
christopher columbuses the right to search state waters for 
undiscovered shipwrecks 
rep jack brooks dtexas countered that the bill already makes 
clear in a nonbinding provision that congress wants the states 
to guarantee exploration and recovery of wrecks under federal 
guidelines intended to protect historic artifacts against 
plundering by profiteers

minnesota is putting the swan back into 
swan lake 
the state wednesday released four giant trumpeter swans at the 
southern minnesota lake to help restore the largest north american 
waterfowl to the area 
it was really thrilling for me said duwayne giefer a 
director at the nicollet conservation club where the rare 
snowwhite birds were released they let them the first pair go 
and they half paddled half flew out of the lagoon to the bigger 
part of the lake then they paddled until they got out behind some 
rushes and disappeared from view 
the release marked the start of the second year of restoration 
efforts by the state department of natural resources 
the giant birds which weigh up to 35 pounds and have a wing 
span of up to eight feet were hunted by pioneers for their down 
and meat 
some of the birds continue to die despite the protection of 
state and federal laws and fines that can exceed 1500 said 
carrol henderson the states nongame wildlife supervisor some 
hunters mistake the swans for ducks or geese and other birds die by 
ingesting lead shot he said 
a number of people had written off trumpeter swans like the 
buffalo i took that as a challenge i felt the birds deserved a 
chance to make a comeback henderson said 
the trumpeter swan population dwindled to fewer than 100 birds 
in the continental united states 50 years ago henderson said they 
now number about 11000 in north america with most of those in 
alaska and have started to make a comeback in the western united 
states 
no one knows how many trumpeters once lived in minnesota but 
the sioux indians called swan lake manha tanka otamenda or 
lake of the many large birds henderson said 
now the state has about 125 of the swans said donna compton of 
the trumpeter swan society 
compton works on a 22yearold restoration project of hennepin 
county parks in the minneapolis area that has placed about 50 birds 
around the state but she admits that success isnt guaranteed 
its a gamble at this point said compton 
the state is raising birds at a cost of 1600 each from eggs 
collected from the western united states canada and alaska and 
plans to release them as they turn 3 years old 
it released its first crop last year in northwestern minnesota 
thirteen birds survived and migrated to iowa and central minnesota 
and they are expected to return this month and mate 
up to 16 more pairs will be released next wednesday near detroit 
lakes in the northwestern part of the state as part of plans to 
place 40 trumpeters a year through 1990 henderson said 
the project is the biggest beneficiary of the states nongame 
wildlife fund which residents can contribute to through their 
income and property taxes the state has spent 140000 so far he 
said 
no federal funds can be used because the bird is not on the 
endangered species list 
actually it was more rare than the bald eagle and yet because 
of this little bureaucratic technicality there was no way we could 
get federal funding to start the program henderson said

the soviets on the verge of signing an 
agreement calling for their withdrawal from afghanistan sent large 
numbers of trucks across the border this week and some 
administration sources said they contained up to 15000 fresh 
combat soldiers 
at the same time soviet armored units already in afghanistan 
moved south from kabul to relieve the beleaguered city of gardez 
according to intelligence sources 
analysts who montor the fighting disagreed over whether the 
trucks which moved across the border contained troops one source 
speaking on condition of anonymity said they apparently were empty 
and intended for use in a soviet withdrawal 
another source said the trucks were believed to contain elite 
combat units to replace engineering and other support troops that 
are thought likely to be among the first to be pulled out 
the activity was reported the day before the soviets were 
expected to sign as guarantors of a united nations agreement on the 
withdrawal of the red army from afghanistan 
the soviet units headed for gardez 80 miles south of kabul and 
60 miles from the pakistani border consisted of an undeterined 
number of soldiers and 420 vehicles including t72 tanks armored 
personnel carriers and mobile rocket launchers said one 
administration source 
mujahedeen guerrillas recently cut the road to gardez where a 
soviet special forces or spetsnaz regiment is garrisoned said 
the source 
some analysts said they believe the soviets will withdraw the 
spetsnaz unit to kabul as they begin to withdraw the red army from 
afghnistan 
the advancing column and the spetsnaz regiment are also expected 
to attack stockpiles of guerilla armaments 
us intelligence analysts were divided as to why the soviets 
sent the 15000 additional soldiers to afghanistan some suggested 
they were sending in more elite combat units to replace engineers 
in their occupation force estimated to total 120000 
other analysts in the administration and on capitol hill fear 
the soviets will heavily fortify the area around the capital city 
of kabul and the northern provinces adjacent to the soviet union 
where afghanistans rich natural gas fields are located 
under the withdrawal agreement the soviets are supposed to pull 
out 50 percent of their troops within 90 days and us analysts 
believe the red army will pull back from exposed positions and 
concentrate in kabul and around the northern city of mazarisharif 
most us analysts believe that the kremlinbacked regime headed 
by najib will collapse during or after the soviet withdrawal the 
intelligence sources said the withdrawal is supposed to be 
completed by feb 15 1989 but the united states wants it finished 
earlier they said 
but the collapse of the kremlinbacked government may not be 
as imminent as we thought before said one source the afghan 
guerrillas are thought to be divided and may not be strong enough 
to take kabul by storm 
the najib regime is backed by an estimate 40000 regular army 
troops 30000 agents and uniformed military units in wad the 
security police agency plus about 40000 men in tribal militias 
the explosion this week at an ammunition depot in islamabad 
pakistan destroyed a large number of us weapons intended for the 
guerrillas pakistani and american officials say they are 
investigating the possibility that the blast was detonated by 
communist agents 
by late wednesday us intelligence had not received concrete 
evidence that the blast was anything but accidental according to 
government sources 
there is no evidence in the intelligence community that it was 
sabotage it is plausible but we dont have any evidence said 
one source 
wad created and run by the soviet kgb has detonated hundreds 
of explosions in pakistan over the last two years 
the intent of the explosions has been to pressure pakistan to 
stop allowing the use of its soil for the training and arming of 
the guerrillas according to us and pakistani officials 
the united nationsbrokered agreement on withdrawing the soviet 
troops also calls for noninterference and nonintervention by 
foreign powers in afghan affairs 
the soviets are expected to use that language to pressure 
pakistan despite a separate deal reportedly worked out between the 
united states and the soviet union under which both will continue 
to supply the warring afghan parties 
defense secretary frank c carlucci reiterated wednesday that 
the covert aid to the guerrillas will continue 
we have negotiated what we call positive symmetry with the 
soviets carlucci said on abctvs good morning america 
program that is to say if they continue their aid to the puppet 
government we will continue our aid to the freedom fighters 
rep charles wilson dtex one of the most ardent 
congressional supporters of the afghan guerrillas said after a 
meeting with secretary of state george p shultz wednesday that he

the senate on wednesday kicked aside two days 
of arguments about truthinbudgeting and began expanding the war 
on drugs as it moved to finish its 11 trillion fiscal 1989 
spending plan 
leaders said they would complete action on the fiscal blueprint 
by thursday 
the senate approved 7618 on wednesday night an amendment 
cutting government travel accounts by 125 million to finance new 
federal prisons and drug law enforcement efforts 
a second 14 billion expansion of drug programs was being 
prepared for the electionyear plan 
lawmakers had been ensnarled since monday in a debate over 
whether surpluses in the social security system and other federal 
trust funds masked the extent of the deficit problem 
the budget claims a deficit of 136 billion in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 but it would be about 220 billion if trust fund 
earnings werent counted 
senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles dfla proposed 
that the senate go on record opposed to counting against the 
deficit the social security surpluses being built up now to be 
spent for future retirees 
other senators then loaded on amendments covering trust funds 
for aviation roadbuilding the postal service military 
retirement and the banking system 
after the accounting issue threatened to put the senate into a 
stall sen pete v domenici rnm won a substitute amendment 
it referred the issue to the new national economic commission 
which will be examining deficit issues over the next year 
the way was then cleared for other amendments including an 
expected proposal to increase spending on drug treatment and law 
enforcement by 14 billion next year 
the amendment being drafted by sens dennis deconcini dariz 
and alfonse damato rny would breach the limits of last falls 
deficit reduction agreement between president reagan and 
congressional leaders 
however the money could be allocated under a clause providing 
for dire emergencies certified by the president and congressional 
leaders the sponsors said the increased cost could be covered by 
increasing collection of debts owed the government and tax law 
enforcement 
last falls budget agreement set overall spending levels for the 
military foreign aid and domestic agencies 
in meeting those caps outside of the new drug spending the 
senate plan cut spending on some subsidies and for development and 
transportation however it also included big increases in spending 
in selected areas those include 
a 27 percent increase in the space program 11 percent more for 
national science foundation research aid and money to start work 
on the proposed superconducting super collider nuclear physics 
project 
a 19 percent boost for aviation safety including hiring more 
air traffic controllers and modernizing equipment 
an increase of 74 percent for education programs 
the pentagon under the budget agreement would spend 294 
billion and 161 billion would be spent on foreign aid 
there were no tax increases included beyond the 14 billion 
enacted last december under the agreement 
the senate and house must agree on a single budget resolution 
before it becomes final the budget which does not require the 
presidents signature becomes congress internal guideline for its 
fiscal legislation 
although this years budget resolutions are similar because of 
the deficit agreement the house and senate disagree on some 
priorities 
the house plan would provide more money for development programs 
and less for the space program the house also voted for a 3 
percent pay raise for all federal employees while the senate 
adopted reagans proposal to give the military 43 percent and 
civilian workers 2 percent

enter israel from lebanon on wednesday and a 70yearold 
palestinian woman died after soldiers tossed tear gas into her

moneychanger and setting stalls ablaze in the bethlehem produce 
market police and witnesses reported an arab passerby was 
reported injured by the firebomb 
soldiers clashed for a second day in gaza with arabs protesting 
the deportation of eight palestinians to lebanon on monday 
five were from the 28milelong coastal strip captured from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war israel accused the deportees of 
inciting much of the four months of violence palestinians call 
the uprising 
soldiers also raided the west bank village of salfit 21 miles 
north of jerusalem the army said several dozen arabs were arrested 
in the village which has declared itself liberated from israeli 
occupation israeli media said 70 were arrested

mission armed with m16 rifles hand grenades and four rockets it 
was the second attempt to infiltrate that area in nine days and the

among the 15 million palestinians in the occupied territories 
which israel has governed since seizing them from jordan and egypt 
21 years ago

propels guerrilla organizations to try to show more participation

mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday a window of 
hope has been opened by the agreement on soviet military 
withdrawal from afghanistan and other improvements in international 
relations 
the soviet leader said the superpowers could reach agreement 
rapidly on a 50percent cut in strategic weapons presumably 
meaning before his fourth summit with president reagan begins may 
29 in moscow 
we are convinced that this goal is attainable in the immediate 
future if both sides are guided by the fundamental approach agreed 
upon at the meetings of the us and soviet leaders rather than by 
momentary considerations and political opportunism he said 
gorbachev played host at the kremlin on wednesday night to 
visiting american business leaders attending the 10th annual 
meeting of the usussr trade and economic council his 
remarks were reported by the official tass news agency 
gorbachev told his american guests including commerce secretary 
c william verity that his ambitious program of economic and 
social reform gives the two countries an opportunity to develop a 
new system of trade ties between the superpowers 
the united states and soviet union can become mutually 
supplementary components of the world economy in the 21st 
century he said offering a review of his leaderships plans for 
accelerating soviet economic progress 
he contended however that some americans still want to use 
economic relations as a lever to interfere in soviet domestic 
affairs 
there are and will be serious differences between our 
countries gorbachev said but the times demand that these 
differences not be a source of enmity and begin being used insofar 
as this is possible as a stimulus to mutually advantageous 
competition 
on international relations we believe that the situation has 
changed for the better that a window of hope has opened a 
little he declared the possibilities of finding solutions to 
complicated issues engendered in the years of the cold war have 
become more apparent 
he said the agreement on afghanistan to be signed thursday in 
geneva may have international implications on a par with the 
superpower treaty signed in december to ban mediumrange nuclear 
missiles 
the geneva agreement commits the kremlin to withdrawing its 
estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan soviet soldiers entered 
afghanistan in december 1979 presided over the replacement of one 
promoscow leader by another and stayed to help fight moslem 
guerrillas 
by participating as mediators and official guarantors in 
settling the afghanistan problem the ussr and the us create 
a precedent of constructive interaction which is needed so badly 
to improve international relations in general gorbachev said 
he said he hoped the afghan settlement will lend an impulse 
to bring about settlements for other regional conflicts 
gorbachev said his program for domestic reform known as 
perestroika or restructuring spawned disagreement in soviet 
society because some people are unwilling to change or give up 
comfortable and convenient practices 
naturally an acute confrontation i would even say a clash 
of views has begun he said 
the soviet leader seemed at pains to assure his american guests 
many of whom do business with the soviet union or may enter joint 
ventures with soviet companies that the confrontation has limits 
and that his reforms will not include introducing capitalist 
practices 
there is struggle but it takes place on a socialist 
platform gorbachev said i would like to warn against 
delusions on this account on the part of those who watch this 
struggle from the sidelines

the rusting williamsburg bridge will be closed 
for inspection and causing headaches for thousands of commuters for 
at least three weeks but the city probably wont be forced to 
close it for good officials said wednesday 
im very very concerned with what i have found its much 
worse than expected in key locations foster j beach iii 
regional director of the state department of transportation said 
wednesday but i think we caught things early enough to repair 
it 
the 85yearold bridge is one of three that cross the east river 
between brooklyn and manhattan and is used by an estimated 100000 
cars and more than 400 subway trains a day 
the bridge was abruptly closed to all vehicles tuesday evening 
after investigators found 30 of the hundreds of steel girders 
inspected thus far were rusted out said transportation 
commissioner ross sandler 
earlier in the week inspectors had already ordered the closing 
of the subway lines across the crumbling bridge and half of the 
car lanes were also out of service the shutdown of the remaining 
car lanes made wednesdays rush hours a nightmare with long 
backups on alternate routes 
at the bridge which was vacant except for an occasional 
pedestrian bicyclist or reporter more than 60 inspectors scoured 
the span about 45 percent of the inspection the first full 
examination since 1984 had been completed officials said 
depending on the results of the search and the corresponding 
repair of any faults the bridge could be open in three weeks said 
deputy commissioner samuel schwartz but the discovery of 
additional major flaws or repair problems could extend that to a 
month or more he warned 
both schwartz and beach indicated that initial fears that the 
bridge would never reopen would probably not be realized but 
officials stressed that the problems at the bridge were severe 
weve found 30 faults already and we could find twice as many 
today said transportation department spokesman victor ross 
these are sections literally holding on by the paint 
mayor edward i koch after examining the bridge himself 
promised the city would not agree to a quick reopening to ease 
congestion while a longterm solution to the bridge problem is 
sought 
it is better to be inconvenienced and safe than convenient and 
dead koch said were going to be very conservative about 
opening this bridge 
the city is due to decide this summer whether to repair the 
bridge at a cost beach estimated at 250 million or to pay 200 
million to 800 million to replace it 
as for who is to blame for the rapidly deteriorating bridge 
officials pointed back to neglect by previous administrations 
the city of new york had no capital budget prior to when i 
came in this bridge has been falling apart since world war ii 
said koch 
all of this was preventable by painting schwartz 
agreed but after world war ii the focus was on building new 
things there was no ribboncutting for the painting of the 
williamsburg bridge 
if wed taken care of it we wouldnt be talking about the 
funeral of the bridge he said wed be talking about its 
centennial

top finance officials of the worlds seven 
major industrial powers putting on a show of unity to reassure 
financial markets agreed wednesday to continue efforts to 
stabilize the value of the dollar 
the group consisting of finance ministers and central bank 
leaders from the united states japan west germany britain 
france canada and italy issued a statement announcing the 
extension of a dec 22 agreement that has so far successfully 
halted the greenbacks threeyear decline 
the twopage joint communique followed a full day of private 
meetings hosted by treasury secretary james a baker iii and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
the statement also announced the adoption of an innovative 
suggestion made by baker last september to use gold and other 
commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures 
in addition the finance ministers were critical of the newly 
industrialized nations of south korea taiwan singapore and hong 
kong for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances 
the meeting was the first facetoface encounter the top finance 
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last 
october a selloff triggered partly by squabbling among the top 
economic powers 
mindful of investors continued uneasiness at any signs of 
disunity the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint 
statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each 
other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession 
the statement reaffirmed a dec 22 agreement that had been 
issued after longdistance discussions in which the seven countries 
pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further 
against major currencies 
the statement said the nations expressed their determination 
to continue to coordinate economic policies to strengthen 
underlying fundamentals 
the general feeling is that the economies of the various 
countries are performing well canadian finance minister michael 
wilson said at the conclusion of the session 
the upbeat tone in the view of most analysts is justified 
growth is higher this year than had been expected and the threat of 
a global recession caused by the market crash has receded 
while the united states is still running a large trade deficit 
the imbalance has been slowly improving in recent months 
the seven nations adopted an american proposal to urge taiwan 
south korea singapore and hong kong to accept greater 
responsibility in correcting large trade imbalances by making 
further efforts to reduce trade barriers and to allow their 
currencies to appreciate more 
all four countries had large trade surpluses with the united 
states last year accounting for almost onefourth of this nations 
record 171 billion trade deficit 
the statement also said the seven nations had agreed to develop 
a commodity price index as an additional economic barometer the 
countries will use to help them to coordinate policy goals 
the statement set no deadline for when the index would first be 
used there were also not details provided of what commodities 
would be included 
at the groups last meeting in september baker had caught other 
finance ministers by surprise when he first suggested the use of 
gold and other commodities as a signal of the presence or absence 
of inflationary pressures 
baker has stressed that the proposal is not a first step back 
toward a gold standard the system by which currencies were 
stabilized for a quartercentury following world war ii 
french finance minister edouard balladur briefing reporters 
after the meeting said that the commodities to be included in the 
index were still to be decided while no timetable was set for 
completion of the study balladur said he expected bakers proposal 
would be reviewed again in midjune at the economic summit in 
toronto 
the joint statement was generally in line with what economists 
and financial investors had been expecting 
i think they realize that if anything would be 
counterproductive at the current time it would be renewed 
squabbling said cynthia latta an economist with data resources 
inc of lexington mass 
the dollar has risen in recent days on currency markets in 
anticipation of the unity statement analysts cautioned however 
that those gains could be quickly lost if a report to be issued 
thursday shows that the us trade deficit for february was 
unexpectedly large 
the administration and its allies launched in effort in 
september 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way of reducing 
americas trade deficits and heading off protectionist moves in 
congress 
the administration publicly renounced further efforts to weaken 
the dollar in february 1987 in an agreement with its allies known 
as the louvre accord in that agreement the major economies 
pledged to work to support the dollars value at thencurrent 
levels 
despite that pact the dollar continued falling for much of 
1987 pushed down by financial markets which feared that steadily 
worsening monthly trade figures would force the administration to 
work for a weaker dollar despite public assurances to the contrary 
the falling dollar raised fears in the united states about 
renewed inflation and prompted the federal reserve last september 
to hike interest rates 
after the oct 19 stock market plunge raised fears of a possible 
global recession the economic powers issued the dec 22 pledge 
reaffirming their commitment to stabilize the dollar they backed 
up that pledge with massive intervention in currency markets the 
process by which countries buy a weak currency such as the dollar 
to prop up its value 
the meetings of the seven top industrial countries were taking 
place during sessions of the 151nation internatinal monetary fund 
and world bank

larry speakes disclosure that he concocted 
quotes for president reagan while white house spokesman drew 
criticism from public relations executives wednesday with most 
calling it deceptive and damaging 
however none was willing to say speakes should quit his 
position as head of communications at the wall street investment 
giant merrill lynch amp co a few said they expected the entire 
episode to fade quickly from public interest 
some sources speaking on condition they not be identified 
suggested it was possible speakes could face sanctions by the 
public relations society of america for violation of its code of 
ethics 
article 7 of the code states a member shall not intentionally 
communicate false or misleading information and is obligated to use 
care to avoid communication of false or misleading information 
but speakes did not become a society member until november well 
after his departure from the white house and the societys 
national secretary isobel parke said the groups attorneys 
believed the code covers the actions of members while they are 
members 
it is written in the present tense it does not refer to 
actions that members may or may not have done before they joined 
she said 
ethicscode violators face penalties from warnings to expulsion 
from the 13000member society 
ms parke would not comment specifically on speakes 
disclosures made in a book about his white house tenure she also 
wouldnt speculate on whether his credibility had been damaged but 
said if any individual deliberately fabricates quotations it will 
indeed damage his trustworthiness particularly with the press 
merrill lynch spokesman william clark said there was no change 
in speakes status at the company and clark rejected a suggestion 
that merrill lynchs own credibility may have been hurt 
the events portrayed in the book had nothing to do with 
merrill lynch clark said 
speakes said tuesday that he had told reagan about the quotes 
and the president never objected but reagan said wednesday he was 
not aware until recent days that speakes had attributed statements 
to him he didnt make 
in the 34 years ive represented controversial and prominent 
people ive never taken it upon myself to make up a quote said 
howard j rubenstein who heads a large pr firm in new york i 
think that goes well beyond reason and creates a false impression 
that public relations people are manipulative and cant be 
trusted 
rubenstein whose clients have ranged from corporate takeover 
strategists to media magnate rupert murdoch seemed to reflect the 
majority view in the industry in saying that credibility is crucial 
and that speakes behavior was quite damaging to all public 
relations people 
nevertheless rubenstein said he did not believe merrill lynchs 
credibility was threatened by the disclosures 
i just think its unfortunate im glad he disclosed it 
though i think its an important catharsis rubenstein said 
if he said nothing no one would ever know about it that would 
be unfortunate because he would be living with a lie 
speakes was criticized by many other public relations 
executives from the biggest international firms to the small 
oneoffice operations 
the bottom line is credibility said anthony r katz senior 
vice president of day ogilvy amp mather one of the worlds largest 
public relations concerns the role of the pr person is to 
communicate to advance a persons point of view responsibly 
the presidents cause was not advanced 
vivian manuel president of vm communications inc a small new 
yorkbased public relations agency said i think when you say 
somebody said something they should have said it 
nevertheless a few said they could understand how speakes may 
have likened the concocted quotes to the job of a speechwriter who 
is sensitive to a clients time pressure and intimately familiar 
with how a client thinks 
if he was making up quotes that in effect made up public 
policy id be a lot more concerned said ernest j dirico chief 
operating officer of fleishman and dirico public relations in 
atlanta 
but i think in a lot of cases whether its a business 
executive or public official they employ a pr person to act as 
official spokesperson he said they assume the pr person would 
have the good sense to know where the boundaries are if you step 
over the boundaries you get fired

algerian officials said wednesday that 
kuwaits intransigence had created a deadlock in negotiations 
with shiite moslem hijackers for the release of 32 hostages on a 
kuwaiti jumbo jet 
food and water were taken in the afternoon to the blueandwhite 
boeing 747 which the hijackers call the plane of martyrdom it 
baked under the north african sun on an isolated patch of tarmac at 
houari boumedienne airport 
a delegation from kuwait arrived wednesday afternoon to help in 
efforts to free the remaining hostages and the plane which was 
hijacked april 5 on a flight from bangkok to kuwait with 112 people 
aboard 
it spent three days on the ground in mashhad iran flew to 
cyprus on friday and arrived here early wednesday 
the six to eight gunmen who have killed two passengers demand

of rejecting blackmail the persian gulf sheikdoms official news 
agency kuna reported we would not change our attitude 
a ranking algerian official told the associated press privately 
if they merely wanted to restate their known position there was 
no need for them to send their highlevel delegation to algiers 
he said the intransigence of kuwait had stalled negotiations 
his remarks appeared to confirm unofficial reports that algeria 
was pressing kuwait for more flexibility 
talks between algerian mediators and the kuwaiti delegation 
continued late wednesday two algerians entered the plane briefly 
wednesday evening 
algiers radio quoting its correspondent at the airport 
reported movement in negotiations between two algerian officials 
and the hijackers according to the british broadcasting corp 
monitored in london 
as a result concrete progress has been made and this might 
lead to a peaceful end to the hijack in the next few hours said 
the correspondent for the stateowned radio 
however the official algerian news agency aps later reported 
little likelihood of an end to the affair tonight 
the news agency said the hijacked plane would be moved to the 
end of the runway to permit a plane carrying zambian president 
kenneth kaunda to land kaunda had been due on a state visit 
the jet left larnaca cyprus early wednesday after 12 more 
hostages were released they arrived wednesday night in kuwait and

northeastern iran passengers released tuesday said one gunman 
boarded the plane at massad and the hijackers got a new supply of 
weapons there 
mohammed saud alosaimi a kuwaiti deputy foreign minister led 
the ninemember delegation to algiers 
he told reporters i hope this will be the last stage of the 
voyage but the kuwait daily al watan quoted yasser arafat 
chairman of the palestine liberation organization as saying i 
dont think this operation will come to an end in algiers 
the plo has been involved in negotiations with the hijackers 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman 
said we had repeatedly indicated that we believed the plane 
should be kept on cyprus and we regret the decision to allow it to 
leave 
a truck drove to the plane wednesday and the hijackers lowered a 
rope made of knotted tablecloths to lift cases of food and water 
through the doorway 
at about the same time one gunman leaned through the pilots 
window and lowered a white sheet to cover part of the kuwait flag 
emblazoned on the aircraft 
before the kuwaitis arrived interior minister hedi khediri 
visited the plane twice and told reporters he was assured the 
gunmen would use no violence on algerian territory 
khediri said he saw five or six hijackers but did not know the 
exact number and was told there were 32 hostages 
adnan rashi majiki a kuwaiti in his 60s who was one of the 12 
freed in larnaca told the ap the hijackers were six but i think 
in mashhad they became seven a kuwait newspaper said wednesday 
one gunman was believed to have boarded the plane in mashhad 
another passenger ramadan ali told us television they 
changed the crew you know their team one of them left and 
another two guys came over and they provided them with new 
weapons and bombs and ropes and explosives 
in an interview with cable network news arafat blamed iran for 
the hijacking when asked who was involved he said some of them 
are lebanese some of them belong to the iranian government 
according to my best information they the iranians are 
behind the whole operation arafat said by telephone from north 
yemen

iraq said wednesday its troops repulsed 
an iranian offensive in kurdistan province and missile batteries 
fired three longrange rockets into tehran iran said it fired two 
missiles into baghdad 
irans islamic republic news agency said iraqi troops launched a 
series of counterattacks tuesday night seeking to recapture 
territory they lost in the northeastern iraqi province 
it said 3500 iraqis have been killed or wounded since the 
offensive was launched monday across the mountainous border south 
of the town of penjwin 
the iraqi news agency said two longrange missiles were fired 
into tehran around noon a third was fired about two hours later 
the iranian agency said four civilians were killed and several 
wounded in the first barrage 
it said two missiles were fired into baghdad several hours 
later iraq did not immediately confirm the reported strikes 
iraq says it has fired 123 missiles into the iranian capital 
since the latest round of the socalled war of the cities 
flared feb 29 iran has retaliated with 57 into baghdad 
tehran radio said iran also fired two shortrange missiles at 
the town of alamarah in southern iraq in retaliation for the 
latest iraqi attacks 
it said iranian jet fighters bombed iraqi troop concentrations 
in the northern province of sulaymaniyah 
reporting on the land offensive the iraqi agency said the 
iranians could not seize a single inch of iraqi territory 
the situation settled in favor of the iraqi forces at 635 
pm 1035 am edt tuesday after 60 hours of unabated 
fighting it said adding that the iraqi troops killed or wounded 
thousands of iranians wiping out four entire brigades 
the iranian agency claimed iraqi warplanes dropped chemical 
bombs as the defenders lost ground in their push into the strategic 
region east of iraqs important kirkuk oilfields 
it said iranian troops were equiped with gas masks and 
protective clothing but many were injured it did not 
elaborate 
it said the iranians captured 25 square miles of iraqi 
territory including strategic heights and several villages 
the agency said iranian jets twice bombed a headquarters of the 
iraqi armys 1st corps at kani mizan west of penjwin on tuesday 
inflicting heavy damage 
penjwin is 25 miles north of an iranian bridgehead around lake 
darbandikhan seized in an offensive last month 
the iraqi agency said helicopter gunships flew 136 combat 
missions on tuesday indicating a sizeable engagement 
there was no independent confirmation of either sides claims 
iran and iraq rarely allow correspondents into the battle zones of 
the 7yearold war 
baghdad has admitted losing territory around lake darbandikhan 
where the iranians say they are threatening a hydroelectric dam 
that supplies much of the power for the region and baghdad 
the new thrust appeared designed to intensify the pressure on 
iraqi troops in the region who are already bogged down fighting 
iranianbacked kurdish guerrillas 
in the persian gulf two more convoys of usflagged kuwaiti 
tankers sailed without incident tuesday 
the uss jack williams escorted the 81283ton oil products 
carrier surf city and the us navy tanker gus w darnell from

representatives of 24 third world countries 
asked banks and governments of developed nations wednesday to 
relieve them of some of their debt burden due to reach 1245 
trillion by the end of this year 
there is no way out of the debt problem without a reversal of 
the negative transfer of resources and a reduction in the debt 
overhang they said in a summary of their recommendations 
the negative transfer refers to the estimate that payments 
by third world countries to the industrial countries last year were 
29 billion more than funds they received this was largely due to 
interest payments on the debt 
the group of 24 speaks for about 130 countries of the 151 
members of the world bank and international monetary fund which 
are holding semiannual meetings in washington this week 
the overriding issue is that the volume of aid to developing 
countries is inadequate to meet the needs of economic growth 
poverty alleviation structural adjustment and the resolution of 
debt difficulties president barber conable of the world bank 
said in a report being presented this week 
he added that if more money is not forthcoming the debtors 
would hold back some of their payments 
there was little expectation of any debt relief on a large scale 
dutch finance minister h onno ruding chairman of the interim 
committee that makes major imf lending decisions spoke earlier in 
the day against grandiose schemes for debt relief 
he spoke in support of the present policy of dealing separately 
with each debtor nation though he added it has been working for 
some but not for others 
negotiators for creditors say any reduction in debt should take 
place only in agreement with the creditors they have accepted some 
losses by stretching out what they call rescheduling 
payments of interest and by reconciling themselves that few heavy 
debtors are paying anything on the prinipal they owe 
brazilian finance minister mailson ferreira da nobrega chairman 
of the group of 24 agreed that solutions should be 
marketoriented he repudiated the practice of some debtors of 
suspending interest payments without the consent of creditors 
brazil did that for most of 1987 
withholding of interest is not good for the whole system he 
told reporters after the meeting

countries

an airliner landed on the wrong runway at londons 
gatwick airport forcing a boeing 737 carrying 119 people to swerve 
into the mud to avoid a crash authorities said wednesday 
an air traffic controller spotted the potential danger and 
prevented a collision the civil aviation authority said the 236 
people aboard the two planes were unharmed it said

killed in the nazi holocaust and president chaim herzog said the 
jewish state was the only guarantee jews would never again be 
victims of mass persecution 
never again will jews become helpless victims never again 
will they be defenseless homeless people without shelter at a time 
of distress never again will their fate be subject to others 
herzog said in a ceremony marking holocaust day 
israel later this month celebrates its 40th anniversary but the 
festivities are overshadowed by the fourmonth arab uprising in 
which 146 people have been killed 144 palestinians and two 
israelis 
the creation of the state of israel saved the jewish people 
from complete destruction herzog told several hundred people at 
the televised ceremony at the yad vashem holocaust memorial on 
mount herzl the holocaust was so desperate it could have been 
the death blow to the jewish people 
never again will there be another holocaust and the state of 
israel is a guarantee for that herzog added 
herzog also stressed that while israelis may be divided on how 
to solve the arabisraeli conflict we are united in all issues 
relating to the security of the nation and there will be no 
compromises 
holocaust day officially called martyrs and heroes remembrance 
day marks the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising of 1943 
in which jews armed with homemade weapons fought housetohouse 
battles with nazi troops backed by tanks 
the ghetto fighters held the nazis back for nearly a month 
about 56000 jews were killed in the battle 
on wednesday and thursday about 100 memorial services were 
scheduled throughout israel

family was killed and those whose family was not we are all the 
second generation of holocaust survivors poet rivka miriam told 
israel radio 
i grew up in a house without grandparents without uncles and 
aunts she said i felt that since i live and exist i live 
for them too

state education officials said wednesday 
they may nullify about 1100 high school students graduation tests 
in paterson after someone raced into a classroom and stole an 
examination booklet 
eastside high school principal joe clark who has earned the 
praise from president reagan for his ironfist nononsense method 
of ruling the urban school claims someone was paid to steal the 
test in order to embarrass him 
it was the essence of chicanery and stealth clark said 
it was done to denigrate and excoriate me 
clark said he didnt know who was behind the tuesday morning 
incident but called them adversarial forces he claimed the 
thief was not a student 
paterson detective sgt samuel torres said he believes based on 
student accounts the thief was a young man who attends the high 
school he said officers werent able to track him down wednesday 
but hoped to find him by thursday 
approximately 1150 eastside students were scheduled to take the 
test 
tuesday was the first day the high school proficiency test was 
administered to about 130000 students across the state students 
must pass the threepart threeday examination in order to 
graduate it is first taken in the 9th grade but students in the 
10th and 11th grades who failed the test in the past are also 
taking the test this week 
assistant education commissioner cummings piatt says an 
instructor was prepared to pass out the tests to five students in 
one eastside classroom when someone holding a hall pass walked into 
the room 
as the teacher inspected the pass said piatt the individual 
reached across a desk grabbed one of the test booklets and ran 
the teacher screamed for help but hall monitors and others were 
unable to catch up to the thief piatt added 
he said that if there is evidence the booklet was circulated 
among students education commissioner saul cooperman and other 
officials may determine that every student at the high school must 
retake the test 
although the test is administered over three days the booklets 
include all three sections said assistant commissioner joel bloom 
torres said he didnt believe that other students had seen the 
test but that he couldnt be sure until a suspect is apprehended 
and questioned he also refused to speculate about a motive 
clark discounted the theory that the suspect is a student and 
said a student wouldnt have been able to pull off the theft 
the rigidity of discipline would have precluded that he 
said 
clark has been recognized by reagan and us education secretary 
william bennett for restoring order at the school once known for 
its violence and open drug dealing 
clark said the individuals behind the theft could include school 
board members city residents or state officials who are jealous of 
his success 
being no 1 makes you vulnerable clark added

the deaths or disappearances of 15 british 
scientists in six years is more than coincidence but there still 
is no proof the cases are linked a computer magazine said thursday 
computer news a highly regarded industry weekly analyzed in 
its latest issue the string of cases dating back to march 1982 
computer news feeling is that its certainly more than a 
coincidence said jane lawrence the magazines editor but we 
have no conclusive evidence 
the government has admitted the spate of cases is odd but has 
insisted the frequency of the deaths is a coincidence and rejected 
calls for an inquiry 
it is possible to believe that the official reluctance to give 
information on these deaths is instinctive rather than 
conspiratorial the magazine said it is equally possible to 
believe that these cases are the tip of an iceberg 
computer news said several of the scientists were working on 
sensitive defense projects particularly in fields relating to 
signal processing which is critical to detecting identifying and 
tracking targets 
many died in unexplained even bizarre circumstances it said 
most resembled suicides although only two have been so ruled 
eight died in 1987 alone 
computer news said speculation the scientists committed suicide 
because of stress cannot be ruled out although many relatives 
felt the scientists had been in good spirits 
the magazine said a particularly odd case involves peter 
peapell 46 found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage 
peapell had a highsecurity job at the royal military college of 
science testing titaniums resistance to explosives 
peapells wife maureen said she last saw her husband alive 
about 3 am one morning in february 1987 after they returned from 
an evening out the magazine said she went to bed and left her 
husband to park the car 
about six hours later she awoke and found him dead under the 
car with the engine running and garage doors closed carbon 
deposits on the garage door showed the engine had been running only 
a short time 
the magazine said peapells head was sticking out faceup from 
underneath the car his mouth virtually aligned with the end of the 
exhaust pipe 
it is not known whether peapell knew john brittan who had left 
the college to work at a defense ministry research establishment 
brittan also was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in his 
garage he and peapell died shortly after returning from business 
trips to the united states 
a young scientific officer at the college died in a mysterious 
car crash in cyprus in april 1987 the magazine said 
another scientist involved in signal processing disappeared four 
days before brittan died but was traced four months later by a 
british newspaper to a boutique in a paris redlight district 
avtar singhgida disappeared while finishing his doctoral thesis 
on underwater signal processing at loughborough university he has 
refused to talk about his disappearance or the death of an 
acquaintance vimal dajibhai a computer programmer at marconi 
defense systems an electronics firm 
dajibhai fell to his death from a bridge in august 1986 
questions also surround the october 1986 death of ashhad sharif 
another expert in advanced ignal processing the magazine said an 
inquest ruled that sharif killed himself by tying a rope to a tree 
looping the other end around his neck and then driving off in his 
car 
four other digital communications experts died unusual deaths 
the magazine said including one who drove a car filled with 
gasoline tanks into an empty cafe

the military was on full nationwide 
alert as president corazon aquino left thursday on a fourday visit 
to china and hong kong her first trip abroad since 1986 
coup jitters have been aggravated by the recent escape of rebel 
military officers including former lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan who tried to overthrow the government in august 
the prudence of this visit at this time after a recent 
incident has been questioned mrs aquino said before leaving 
in a reference to opposition calls to cancel the visit because of 
honasans escape 
on the contrary its cancellation would be the greatest 
folly she added for our visit to china will show our great 
neighbor that we have at least achieved the internal political 
stability and peace to play a responsible and important role that 
is expected of us in asian affairs 
mrs aquino said the visit would also provide an opportunity to 
meet chinas new leadership and renew our mutual principal of 
noninterference in each others internal affairs china stopped 
supporting communist rebels in the philippines after beijing and 
manila established full diplomatic relations in the mid1970s 
mrs aquinos last trip abroad was to japan in november 1986 
on wednesday mrs aquino assured her cabinet that maximum 
security measures had been taken to keep the country safe during 
her absence according to presidential press secretary teodoro 
benigno defense secretary fidel ramos said the 160000member 
armed forces would crush any attempted coup 
nothing can happen that can topple the government in one fell 
swoop said brig gen rodolfo biazon manila area military 
commander on wednesday 
however he said both military renegades and communist rebels 
fighting the government for almost 20 years could still be 
dangerous of course these crazy guys running around out there 
can commit some crazy things like bombing some isolated facility 
or even assassinating somebody 
cardinal jaime l sin the countrys most prominent clergyman 
appealed for peace wednesday he said he was praying to keep all 
the enemies of peace and democracy away from our beautiful land 
during mrs aquinos absence 
after wednesdays cabinet meeting ramos announced the 
nationwide troop alert and said it would remain in effect until the 
president returns sunday 
he also said security had been doubled at a military prison near 
manila to prevent further escapes by 157 military officers and 
enlisted men held in connection with the aug 28 coup attempt the 
most serious of several bids to overthrow mrs aquino since she 
came to power in february 1986 it left 53 people dead and more 
than 300 wounded 
honasan the alleged mastermind of that coup escaped with 14 of 
his prison guards april 2 from a ship where he had been held since 
his december arrest 
three other soldiers held for previous coup attempts have also 
escaped in the past two weeks 
the military also said wednesday that communist new peoples 
army guerrillas fired on one of its helicopters shortly after it 
landed near dumaguete about 400 miles south of manila on negros 
island 
two colonels and two sergeants were wounded in tuesdays attack

the leaders of the national symphony and the 
new york philharmonic were the toppaid music directors of leading 
orchestras each pulling in upwards of 600000 according to a 
survey of 1986 tax records published wednesday 
mstislav rostropovich earned 687000 at the national symphony 
in washington during 1986 and zubin mehta earned more than 
638000 as music director of the new york orchestra the same year 
according to internal revenue service records 
the baltimore evening sun obtained the 1986 irs records the 
survey offers a glimpse into the inner workings of these 
organizations which usually steer clear of revealing financial 
details 
at other orchestras with glossy artistic reputations music 
directors apparently earn more modest salaries the boston symphony 
paid its music director seiji ozawa 381000 in 1986 the 
cleveland orchestras christoph von dohnanyi earned nearly 
332000 and the chicago symphony paid sir georg solti 355000 a 
year earlier the newspaper reported 
patty okelly a spokeswoman for the national symphony 
orchestra disputed the figure for rostropovich and said auditors 
were reviewing tax records in response to the evening sun article 
we believe that mr rostropovichs salary was misstated by 
more than 200000 due to an inadvertent error by our former 
auditors ms okelly said we are having the form reworked 
by our current auditors and will be filing an amended return 
in accordance with their findings 
she said rosptropovichs exact salary would not be known until 
the audit is finished 
music directors conduct their home orchestras only part of the 
year solti and rostropovich for example lead their orchestras in 
a concert season that lasts only eight to 10 weeks per year plus 
whatever time is spent in rehearsal ozawa conducts boston about 16 
weeks during the regular season 
when they are not appearing with their home orchestras 
conductors make guest appearances at other orchestras and at summer 
festivals which can significantly increase earnings 
private expense accounts and the royalties from recordings and 
broadcasts are also not listed on tax returns some conductors 
such as solti and ozawa record extensively 
as taxexempt organizations symphony orchestras must file irs 
tax returns those documents require each orchestra to list its 
five highest paid employees as well as the five highestpaid people 
hired as consultants or other professionals 
despite this at least one orchestra surveyed elected to omit 
the music directors salary from its tax return philadelphia left 
out any reference to music director riccardo muti from its 1985 tax 
return the latest available the orchestra declined to comment to 
the newspaper 
in some cases the payments are made to corporations set up for 
tax reasons 
bostons ozawa is paid through a corporation called veroza inc 
which is an amalgam of his wifes name vera ozawa rostropovichs 
fees are paid to pooks concert inc named after the russianborn 
conductors late pet a miniature dachshund the minnesota 
orchestra expressed former director neville marriners salary as a 
range of 250000 to 350000 a notation informs the irs that the 
exact figure is available on request 
symphony salaries have come under increasing scrutiny as many of 
the nations orchestras suffer difficult financial times and turn 
to taxpayers for assistance 
the baltimore symphony has steadfastly declined to reveal 
financial details of david zinmans new sixyear contract as music 
director even though more than onethird of the orchestras 9 
million operating budget is underwritten by maryland taxpayers the 
orchestras 1986 tax return lists zinmans salary as 193500 for 
the 198586 season his first as music director 
most orchestras had similar responses to requests for comment 
the newspaper said 
weve made it a longstanding policy not to discuss any aspect 
of salaries said francis little spokesman for the new york 
philharmonic 
the newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that recent 
reports that lorin maazel will get 1 million per year in a 
contract set to take effect later this year at the pittsburgh 
symphony were exaggerated 
nevertheless music industry insiders believe that maazel will 
be the highest paid music director in america next fall the 
evening sun said maazels salary at pittsburgh in 1986 when he 
was only a parttime music adviser was 125000

between afghanistan and its eastern neighbor pakistan where about 
35 million afghan refugees live the soviet union and the united 
states which supports the guerrillas will sign as guarantors 
the insurgents who began fighting after a communist coup in 
april 1978 were not included in the negotiations and say they will 
ignore the result pakistan spoke for them in geneva

attacks on soviet and afghan units since spring thaws opened their 
mountain supply routes the kremlin sent military forces to 
afghanistan in december 1979 and now has an estimated 115000 
soldiers there 
us government analysts in washington said wednesday that large 
numbers of soviet trucks were sent to afghanistan in the past week 
some reagan administration sources said the trucks carried 15000 
more troops but other analysts said they were empty and were sent 
to bring soldiers home

secretary of state george p shultz will sign for the superpowers

the horizon the dawn of victory is taking its place 
he praised gorbachev for statesmanship farsightedness and 
courage declaring that the soviet leader chose the way of 
peace put a balm on the bleeding wound of the soviet union 
junejo said pakistan is indebted to reagan for his determined 
and principled support which enabled the great freedom struggle to 
meet with success 
pakistan refused to deal directly with afghanistan because it 
does not recognize the communist government now led by najib 
cordovez shuttled between the two delegations during six years of 
negotiations 
some elements of that problem persisted in arrangements for the 
final ceremony 
all signers agreed to convene in the same room an ornate 
chamber of the palais des nations the geneva un office and 
former headquarters of the league of nations 
foreign minister abdul wakil of afghanistan however will enter 
through a different door than pakistani counterpart zain noorani 
cordovez said the two are not expected to shake hands or exchange 
documents directly 
the agreement provides for withdrawal of all soviet troops 
pledges by pakistan and afghanistan of noninterference in each 
others affairs and the safe and voluntary return of about 5 
million afghan refugees from pakistan and iran 
moscow and washington are to guarantee afghanistans future 
nonalignment and the united nations will supervise the settlement 
including the return of refugees 
soviet troops are to leave within nine months starting may 15

gov rose mofford freed from the threat 
of a recall aimed at her predecessor began filling empty slots in 
state government wednesday but said she had not decided whether to 
seek a full term in 1990 
meanwhile republican exgov evan mecham criticized tuesdays 
state supreme court decision canceling the recall election but 
declined immediate comment on his own plans 
in a radio interview wednesday mecham said an appeal to the 
us supereme court of the state court ruling is a possibility 
thats open to us but he acknowledged the high court might not 
agree to hear the case theres also been no decision on whether to 
appeal a senate impeachment decision to the federal courts he said 
weve been handed a bucket of lemons and were going to make a 
barrel of lemonade he told supporters tuesday there isnt 
anything in the law in the constitution that says that the 
supreme court can cancel this election 
mecham had been scheduled for a live interview tuesday night on 
a ktsptv news program but he walked off the set seconds before 
airtime saying there was not a meeting of the minds on the 
format mecham said he wanted to read a statement but ktsp news 
director david howell insisted on only questions and answers 
mrs mofford a democrat on wednesday appointed a new secretary 
of state to replace her in that position and said she plans to name 
her permanent staff by friday 
she became governor april 4 when mecham was convicted on 
impeachment charges she had been acting governor during the trial 
mecham had hoped to regain the governors post in the recall 
election that had been set for may 17 in her comments to reporters 
wednesday mrs mofford 65 declined to say if she would run for a 
fouryear term in 1990 saying it was a long way off 
she also said she hoped to begin sending nominations of agency 
heads and commission members to the senate for confirmation 
state elections director jim shumway was appointed secretary of 
state after karen osborne who had been serving as acting 
secretary turned the permanent post down mrs mofford said 
speaking with reporters after an appearance at a day care center 
for state employees she said she would oppose any effort by 
wouldbe recall candidates to recoup expenses from the state and 
had no plans for a quick state of the state address to the 
legislature because theres enough legislation there that needs 
work already 
the gopcontrolled legislatures annual regular session began in 
january and normally wraps up several months later however 
mechams impeachment trial by the senate took up so much time that 
a delayed adjournment is expected with a major sticking point a 
198889 budget shortfall projected at 300 million to 350 million 
mrs mofford said she would concentrate on boosting arizonas 
economy i plan to go out in the hinterlands she said 
in tuesdays 41 decision on a suit filed by two taxpayers the 
state supreme court said that because mecham already was removed 
from office by impeachment conviction the regular order of 
succession must take precedence over the state constitutions 
recall provisions 
the justices did not give detailed reasons for their ruling 
saying they would issue a formal opinion later justice james duke 
cameron provided the dissenting vote 
mecham still faces a may 19 trial on criminal charges accusing 
him of concealing a 350000 loan to his 1986 campaign 
the impeachment trial ended with his conviction on charges that 
he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat and 
that he misused a protocol fund by loaning 80000 to his auto 
dealership

the united states has plans to continue using 
pakistan as a covert resupply point for afghan rebels so long as 
the soviet union funnels weapons to the current regime in kabul 
lawmakers briefed by secretary of state george p shultz said 
wednesday 
the arrangement as understood by both the soviets and the 
united states is at odds with a deal under which the soviet union 
is pulling its troops out of afghanistan and pakistan is pledging 
not to intervene in its neighbors affairs 
this is planned calculated ambiguity said rep charles 
wilson dtexas a member of the intelligence committee and one of 
the leading house supporters of the anticommunist rebels known as 
the mujahedeen we have said publicly to the russians and to the 
world that we are going to continue to supply the mujahedeen 
asked whether that aid would be accomplished overtly or 
covertly wilson said everything has been done covertly and 
noted that pakistan continues to deny officially that they have 
helped in us rebel supply efforts 
we fully expect the soviet union to accuse pakistan of 
violating this agreement and we fully expect pakistan to deny 
it he said 
and we fully expect the soviet union to accuse us of 
continuing to supply arms to the mujahedeen and we fully expect to 
accuse the soviet union of continuing to supply a minority puppet 
government in kabul and we fully expect our side to win wilson 
said 
shultz who separately briefed house members and senators on 
wednesday was traveling to geneva thursday for a signing ceremony 
for the agreement which he will sign for the united states as a 
guarantor of the accord 
wilson and most other lawmakers said they were satisfied with 
shultzs assurances that the rebels will continue to receive us 
aid but a few staunch conservatives voiced objections to the 
agreement 
were depending on assurances the good faith of the soviet 
union to abide by vague agreements said rep phil crane rill 
who noted that the rebels themselves whom the united states 
recognizes as the legitimate voice of afghanistan have rejected 
the agreement and vowed to continue fighting 
i cant help but entertain a great deal of skepticism crane 
said 
rep dan burton rcalif said i assume that there would 
have to be some kind of violation of the accords to continue aid 
to the rebels because aid can only be supplied through pakistan 
my concern is that at some point they might be forced to live 
up to the letter of the accords burton added he said he feared 
that the soviet union at some point would be able to turn any us 
covert supply effort in violation of the agreement into a 
propaganda weapon against the united states 
the mujahedeen have the soviet union with their tail between 
their legs heading for the border he said the pressure 
should be constant until the soviets are completely out of the 
country 
fourteen republican senators in a letter to president reagan 
made public wednesday said they were shocked that the united 
states intends to sign as a guarantor to the geneva accords 
despite the vehement opposition of the afghan resistance alliance 
the senators said the us action sends a tragic message to 
the people of afghanistan the letter was released by rep gordon 
humphrey rnh a staunch backer in congress of the antisoviet 
guerrillas

democrat albert gore jr said wednesday 
that rival michael dukakis showed foreign policy inexperience with 
an unwise and irresponsible statement that he would reserve the 
right to respond with nuclear force if the soviets invaded western 
europe 
gore said dukakis had erred in saying that he would launch a 
nuclear strike against the soviet union under specific 
circumstances but transcripts indicated the governor did not 
make such a statement 
nonetheless gore accused the massachusetts governor of 
violating a longheld tenet of american foreign policy that 
presidents and aspirants for that office do not spell out to the 
soviets or any other country how the united states would make use 
of nuclear arsenals in response to agression 
with new yorks democratic presidential primary one week away 
and looming as crucial for his candidacy the tennessee senator 
seized on comments attributed to dukakis in an interview published 
wednesday in the new york daily news 
governor dukakis made a significant mistake in saying that he 
would launch a nuclear strike against the soviet union under the 
following specific circumstances gore said thats unwise and 
irresponsible and it underscores that experience in foreign 
policy is relevant 
gore made his assault on dukakis at a breakfast with business 
and civic leaders on long island and later with reporters 
dukakis remarks were contained in a story in the newspaper 
which quoted him as saying of the scenario of a soviet attack on 
europe our present strategy in europe assumes that if the 
soviets were to invade and conventional forces couldnt stop them 
we reserve the right to use nuclear force i dont think thats 
going to happen and in fact i see the opposite happening 
gore also had criticism for rival jesse jackson saying he had 
displayed his lack of foreign policy experience with a remark 
before the ussoviet agreement on intermediate nuclear weapons in 
europe was reached that he would unilaterally halt deployment gore 
said the agreement would not have taken place had the united states 
taken the position jackson advocated 
gore also criticized dukakis as a little murky on the 
question of establishing an independent state for palestinians a 
subject of campaign discussion in recent days as the battle for new 
yorks 255 delegates has focused on middle east issues and the 
concerns of the states influential jewish population 
the gore campaign however considered dukakis statement on a 
nuclear response to be a major event in the new york campaign san 
francisco fundraiser and gore adviser duane b garrett said 
dukakis has shown he is error prone and compared the nuclear 
statement to major gaffes of earlier campaigns president fords 
suggestion that poland was not under soviet influence and 
republican george romneys remark that he had been brainwashed on 
the issue of vietnam 
i see this as a major blunder of that caliber said garrett 
speaking to the breakfast group gore said neither of his 
democratic rivals had any foreign policy experience and defending 
his own statement added thats not a personal attack its just 
fact 
he described the dukakis interview as a fresh illustration 
one of my opponents said in an interview yesterday that he 
would launch a nuclear first strike against the soviet union if 
they invaded europe with conventional forces gore said in an 
apparent misrepresentation of dukakis comments 
it is a mistake it is irresponsible to publicly state well 
launch our missiles and trigger nuclear war under these 
circumstances or those circumstances gore said thats been 
held in reserve and covered with uncertainty we want to exist in 
the minds of our adversaries in this world for good reason 
later campaigning in niagara falls ny gore stood by his 
criticism of dukakis and his characterization of dukakis remarks 
i think it is most unwise for a president of the united states 
or a major candidate for the presidency to be drawn into a 
hypothetical discussion of when we would launch our nuclear forces 
and trigger the destruction of human civilization he said 
asked if he would rule out the use of nuclear weapons gore 
said i will not be drawn into a hypothetical discussion 
governor dukakis made a serious mistake in allowing himself to be 
drawn into that discussion and then in saying that he would launch 
a first strike against the soviet union if they launched a 
conventional war on europe 
during an appearance wednesday night in westchester county gore 
read from a transcript of the newspaper interview and said dukakis 
had been asked whether he could conceive of the first use of 
strategic weapons 
nato has purposely refused to respond to that hypothetical 
he said the president of the united states has traditionally 
refused to respond to that hypothetical 
gore stood in front of the love canal hazardous waste site and 
denounced the reagan administration for what he said was a failure 
to enforce environmental protection laws and a failure to see that 
such sites are properly cleaned up 
this administrations record on environmental protection is 
disgraceful and love canal stands as a symbol of their 
unwillingness to act he said 
as a house member gore chaired the first congressional hearings 
into the dumping of hazardous wastes at the love canal site

details of a hostel but that mrs thatcher told mother teresa about 
the work being done by british voluntary service organizations 
mother teresa said that during her london visit i went with 
the sisters to bring a little bit of hot soup and food to homeless 
people 
they were inside that cardboard box made like a little coffin 
i didnt know what to say my eyes were full of tears 
there was this man lying there protecting himself from the 
cold with no home and no hope he looked up and said its a 
long long time since i felt the warmth of a human hand 
also at the oxford forum mother teresa disagreed sharply with 
advocates of contraception urging natural family planning 
methods instead 
i never give a child for adoption to a family that uses 
contraceptives that kill the power of love she said how can a 
mother love anothers child if she has killed the child of her 
love

gov michael s dukakis hailed an innovative 
universal health care bill wednesday as the product of broad 
popular support despite its extremely narrow margin of approval in 
the state legislature 
im very proud of the fact that massachusetts will be the 
first state in the nation ever to have legislation which will 
guarantee basic health insurance to all of our citizens something 
which is long overdue for massachusetts and long overdue for the 
country dukakis said at a statehouse news conference 
the governor who has trumpeted the legislation in his 
presidential campaign said he had not decided when to sign the 
bill but it was widely expected that he would do so before next 
tuesdays presidential primary in new york 
this is the culmination of months of work years really by 
a great many people in this state and across this country he 
said we couldnt possibly have done it without the help of a 
broad and very strong coalition of labor business and health 
care professionals 
in fact however the bill barely passed the legislature which 
is dominated by a 4to1 democratic majority the house accepted a 
lastminute compromise version by a vote of 7775 and the senate 
did the same early wednesday by an 1815 margin 
the votes which ended nearly nine months of intense legislative 
debate and negotiations with a host of special interests resulted 
in a plan to guarantee health insurance to all massachusetts 
residents by 1992 at a possible cost of 1 billion 
as late as tuesday labor unions were upset by a provision that 
potentially could reduce public employee health care benefits by 
removing the issue from collective bargaining 
legislative leaders fearing they would be unable to get a 
twothirds majority needed to correct the bill decided to put the 
collective bargaining amendment in an unrelated bill which dukakis 
promised to sign 
dukakis argued that the concern over rollbacks in public 
employee health plans was the primary reason for the narrowness of 
the vote citing public opinion surveys and a ballot question 
dukakis said universal health care was an idea whose time has come 
i think were sending a very important signal out that is 
that 40 yeras after harry truman first proposed it were finally 
on the road to basic health security dukakis said 
the bill sets jan 1 1992 as the deadline for businesses to 
begin offering health insurance to their employees or begin paying 
an unemployment surcharge to the state so it can provide coverage 
to the estimated 600000 uninsured residents of the state 
despite adding an exemption for businesses of five or fewer 
employees tax breaks statesponsored pooled insurance and the 
possibility of outright state subsidies republican opponents 
repeatedly warned that the bill would raise business costs 
bankrupt some businesses and discourage expansion of others 
the twopart bill also renews the states hospital financing law 
and contains about 1 billion in hospital fee increases over the 
next four years about 95 million in additional new revenues was 
added for 42 hardpressed hospitals 
dukakis has budgeted 78 million in fiscal 1989 as the states 
share in the first full year of the fouryear universal health care 
phasein but cost estimates over four years vary widely from 
550 million to 12 billion

an estimated 1000 turkish aliens and their 
supporters rallied outside parliament tuesday but gained no 
concessions from the government in their fight against deportations 
about 100 turks had marched for nine days from montreal to 
ottawa in a proptest against canadas deportation policies some 
said they planned to march back to the montreal airport and ask 
people along the route for help in their campaign 
immigration minister barbara mcdougall told leaders of the 
group and later informed parliament in a special statement that 
she would not give a reprieve to the turks who have been ordered to 
leave the country 
about 2000 turks sold their belongings and flew to canada two 
years ago after travel agents in turkey told them they would have 
no trouble starting a new life in canada as refugees 
most settled in montreal and found jobs 
but canadian authorities subsequently declared that the turks 
were not legally refugees and said they should have applied to 
immigrate through normal channels about 400 returned to turkey 
voluntarily the march was launched after the government began 
issuing deportation orders to the others 
opposition parties asked the immigration ministry to offer 
reprieves to the turks for humanitarian reasons noting the 
government granted special admission to 40000 refugees last year 
they were just fooled by some crooks in their own country 
said liberal party sen jacques hebert who joined the march 
they are here almost two years now and then we say well 
byebye theres something cruel and inhuman in that 
but the immigration minister said waiving the rules for the 
turks would set a precedent for handling the backlog of 48000 
refugee claimants who entered canada in the past few years under 
immigration policies that she said were lax 
the government has introduced two bills now in the senate to 
toughen the laws 
we recognize they the turks were victims of unscrupulous 
travel agents the minister said 
she added she would approve immigrant visa applications for any 
of the turks who once back in their country applied through 
normal procedures to come to canada and live 
but the turks said they could not afford the transportation 
costs 
the people at the rally marched to parliament hill behind a 
large white banner saying today the turks tomorrow the rest 
one man held up a small message reading i love canada please 
let me stay here

white house press secretary james brady who 
was injured by a shot from a saturday night special in the 
assassination attempt on president reagan applauded marylands new 
gun control law tuesday 
at a news conference brady called the law one small step for 
mankind one giant step for maryland 
on monday the maryland legislature passed a law that would make 
it the first state to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as 
saturday night specials gov william donald schaefer has promised 
to sign the legislation 
bradys wife sarah had campaigned vigorously for passage of 
the bill and called it a good first step she said tuesday she 
hoped other states will follow marylands example 
its a wonderful victory for advocates of gun control said 
mrs brady who called the cheap handguns the no 1 crime gun in 
the country 
mrs brady told legislators at a hearing earlier this year that 
a 29 handgun that would be banned under the maryland law was used 
by john w hinckley jr in his 1981 assassination attempt that 
wounded the president and left her husband partly disabled 
brady has held on to the title of press secretary despite his 
injury and visits the office about once a week 
the bill directs the governor to create a state handgun roster 
board headed by the state police superintendent the ninemember 
board will list guns that can be sold in maryland and will be 
required to withhold approval of 
guns that are inaccurate poorly made easily concealed and 
manufactured of cheap materials 
guns made mostly of plastic or ceramic materials that cant be 
readily detected by security systems at airports and public 
buildings 
guns that have had the manufacturers serial number obliterated 
or altered 
the bill provides fines of 2500 to 10000 for anyone who 
sells guns not on the approved list it will be illegal only to 
sell the weapons not to own them 
illinois hawaii south carolina and minnesota have laws that 
ban guns based on the melting point of the metal according to the 
lobbying group handgun control inc guns with lower melting points 
are of poorer quality and thus cheaper 
however both the national rifle association and handgun control 
said no state regulates guns on the basis of accuracy ease of 
concealment plastic or ceramic construction or the other 
characteristics in the maryland law 
clearly this is going to add some impetus to other states 
considering gun control laws this is an example well be taking to 
other states said michael beard executive director of the 
national coalition to ban handguns 
im hoping congress will look at what maryland did said 
attorney general j joseph curranthats where this action is 
needed 
but an nra representative said he feared the spread of similar 
legislation 
i just hope its not a trendsetting thing where a lot of 
states start setting up boards said nra liaison charles h 
cunningham after the senates 3510 vote saturday the house passed 
the bill 9541 monday 
the ban on the sale of saturday night specials will take effect 
jan 1 1990 the board will be required to prepare a list of 
approved guns by july 1 1989

the children wanted to know about the ghost 
in the lincoln room and president reagan was pleased to tell them 
that his dog rex may have had an encounter 
the president said his dog would go by the lincoln room look 
in growl and back out said ac lyles producer of 
conversations with the presidents a onehour show to be shown 
on abc on saturday 
mr reagan told them rex must see something i dont see 
mrs roosevelt used to talk about how lincoln would come and visit 
with her 
lyles who has known ronald reagan since their early days in 
hollywood persuaded reagan and former presidents ford and carter 
to talk with groups of children 
reagan talked to the children at the white house carter was at 
the presidential center at atlanta and ford at rancho mirage 
calif 
former president nixon withdrew from the show after abc 
announced a miniseries based on the book final days which told 
of his last days as president before he resigned 
ronald reagan and i came to hollywood about the same time 
said lyles who has been with paramount studios for 50 years i 
saw a side i liked the human side most people dont see that i 
thought what a wonderful thing it would be if children talked to 
the presidents 
i remember when i was just a kid working on the newspaper in 
jacksonville fla and i interviewed president roosevelt when he 
came to town i took the idea to abc got an ok i mentioned it to 
the president when i was on air force one and he loved the idea 
then i got in touch with the former presidents 
lyles said he wanted children because they ask questions adults 
would never think to ask one child asked reagan what he was 
thinking about when he was sworn in as president another asked him 
how he met the first lady and did they kiss on their first date 
carter told of being the first person in his family to go to 
college adding that he went to the naval academy because it was 
free 
carter told them his house had no running water and there was 
no electricity in the town lyles said he said their only 
source of entertainment was the radio every night they took the 
battery out of the car and rigged it up to run the radio carter 
was asked who he would like to play him in a movie and he said 
robert redford ford told them of being the only president who was 
adopted as a child 
lyles said he thought the children would be intimidated at going 
to the white house to meet reagan but they went right in and i 
think the president put them right at ease he said i dont 
know who had more fun the kids or the president 
the children who were selected by the schools in each area 
ranged in age from 9 to 14 
one girl told me her grandfather was going to tape the show 
said lyles she said she could hardly wait to show it to her 
kids 
lyles talked about the show at paramount studios where he is 
practically an institution his office walls are covered with 
dozens of pictures of himself with stars and other famous people 
on a tripod in his office is an old handcranked mitchell camera 
used to film wings the first movie to win an academy award

funnyman bobby bittman doesnt get much of a 
reaction when he tells his nightclub audience that a crew is there 
filming his life story but bittman cannot be denied 
i think that deserves a little applause the shameless 
bittman says and he gets it 
slimy grasping grating and unfunny bobby bittman is easily 
the least lovable television character outside of a world war ii 
documentary 
hes getting more despicable by the day said sctv alumnus 
eugene levy director writer and star of autobiographies the 
enigma of bobby bittman the cinemax comedy experiment premieres 
saturday and repeats april 19 22 24 and 28 
i love the character because it was the only character i did 
on sctv that was just revolting and obnoxious levy said he 
was fun to do 
levys sctv work also included mel slurp the nerdy host of 
mels rock pile anchorweasel earl camembert and stan shmenge 
the skinny half of the shmenge brothers polka act 
in the cinemax show bittman is even more offensive and 
untalented than he appeared on sctvs sammy maudlin show 
braying howarya and trading fawning tributes with the host 
joe flaherty and his oleaginous sidekick william b john candy 
the sammy maudlin show was a product of second citys attempt to 
start a theater in a shopping mall in pasadena said levy who was 
part of a group picked from the toronto and chicago casts to open 
the venture 
in california they discovered a parodists promised land on 
television sammy davis jr and sammy and company 
oh it was just hypnotic levy said 
sammy would bring someone on and say isnt this man 
marvelous isnt he just marvelous could i say something about 
this man right here i know you dont want me to talk about it 
man but i feel its a story that has to be told 
then he would gush about the charitable works of the guest who 
in turn praised the host and so on on the sctv version sammy 
william b and bobby were often reduced to tears by the 
magnificence of each others hearts and talents 
and no there was no truth to speculation that levy brought 
bittman to the big apple to catch some reflected glamour from the 
rat pack tour which brought davis and frank sinatra through 
town a week earlier 
i would have seen that concert had it come to toronto you 
know i would have paid 75 and gone and seen those boys levy 
said 
instead he got a review from fellow canadian paul shaffer 
director of david lettermans late night band who is either 
doing or has become a neverending parody of vegas 
shaffer found the rat pack show disappointing levy reported 
sadly 
i was kind of hoping it would be a great concert for them in 
some strange perverted way because its like a bygone era levy 
said 
its true a lot of the basis for some of the characters we 
did on sctv like the sammy maudlin show their center of gravity 
was 60s vegas you know the shecky greens the alan kings and 
that whole thing 
in his cinemax autobiography bobby shows a lot of jerry lewis 
especially in his split with partner buddy dummy phelps and 
the trademark howarya is a swipe at marty allens hello 
dere 
this is no affectionate tribute levys bittman is more of an ax 
murder in some swingin lounge scene man 
there are a lot of people that might say why dont you end 
this mans life and do us all a favor but no im not through 
with him levy said 
while waiting for that sentimental bittman and company tour 
in 2010 levy is spending more time writing and hes just signed a 
deal with disney to develop some television programs 
he hopes too that sctv can come back together 
it was just a huge creative high doing the show a lot of 
great memories and it doesnt matter what weve done since the 
show i dont think there has been any one project that has been as 
creatively fulfilling levy said

use the same baby sitter often hire a 
collegestudent neighbor to cut your lawn during the summer 
have a regular housekeeper governess au pair handyman 
gardener butler or chauffeur 
congratulations you are most likely an employer of domestic 
help eligible to pay social security tax federal and state 
unemployment tax and maybe even withholding tax on the workers 
income 
you may not think of yourself as a member of the upstairs 
downstairs set with the kind of resources at your disposal to 
preside over a household staff 
but the rules say that if you pay anybody as little as 50 or 
more in any calendar quarter for household services you may have 
yourself an employee for whom at least social security taxes must 
be paid 
people who have been through this sort of thing attest that it 
is an experience full of paperwork hassles and the potential for 
bureacractic nightmares dealing with a wide variety of government 
agencies 
it doesnt take a cynic to acknowledge that a great many 
household helpers around the country are paid off the books in 
cash this kind of work is a big and vigorous part of what is known 
as the underground economy it is not only cheaper to operate that 
way but also a whole lot simpler 
however household employers who either wittingly or unwittingly 
fail to follow the letter of the law do so at their peril 
suppose you hire a regular baby sitter with the understanding 
that the two of you will skip the heavy paperwork and that 
payments will be made in cash things dont work out to your 
satisfaction and a few months later you dimiss the baby sitter 
if only just to spite you the baby sitter could decide to 
report you to the authorities 
once they determined that you hadnt complied with the rules 
they would very likely start dunning you for payment of both your 
and the baby sitters share of social security taxes owed 
together thats 1502 percent of all wages up to 45000 a year 
add to the bill interest from the date the payments were due 
plus penalties of up to 25 percent of the amount owed and another 
25 percent for failure to file the required returns 
furthermore you could also be subject to penalties for 
negligence observes the accounting firm of spicer amp oppenheim 
beyond social security federal unemployment taxes must be 
withheld for anyone whose pay exceeds 1000 a year while state 
rules vary 
earnings for domestic work performed in a private residence are 
not subject to withholding for income tax purposes unless both the 
employee and you want to handle it that way 
one school of thought holds that you might as well go ahead and 
do the incometax withholding if you are already reporting and 
paying the required social security and unemployment taxes 
there is at least one legal way to get the household services 
you want done without taking on the burden of becoming an employer 
if a baby sitter for example comes from an agency that is in 
the sitting service business and that sets the hourly rates and 
conditions of employment in most cases the service rather than 
you is considered the employer 
beware though of trying to make such a case if the service 
merely operates as an employment agency providing referrals 
this is a fine distinction in an area of the tax rules that is 
full of fine distinctions 
in the daily busyness of life it is easy to let such matters 
slide it also can be very costly

you can defer taxes while saving money for your 
retirement sometime in the future but you cannot defer taxes while 
saving for the down payment on a home for the present 
to some housing people this constitutes a monumental 
incongruity and they would like to see a housing equivalent of 
individual retirement accounts which allow many people to 
accumulate funds without immediate taxes 
among other things they contend that living well during the 
preretirement decades is equally as important as living well in 
the fewer years to follow 
they concede that lowincome retirement years can be difficult 
without a supply of funds but they counter by saying that low 
incomes and big expenses of young couples can make them as 
distressed as any retiree 
among others the national association of home builders is now 
pushing a housing agenda for the 1990s that would allow interest on 
savings to be taxdeferred if earmarked for the purchase of a house 
youll be hearing a lot about that agenda because hearings are 
now being held around the country to assist congress in gathering 
data on the subject and that data is liking to serve as a 
blueprint for later action 
while it can be argued that home builders will support almost 
any legislation that makes their lives more comfortable they do 
have some telling evidence in support of a housing ira 
first there is the high price of housing high is a relative 
term of course but how can you argue that a fivefold increase in 
housing prices over the last 20 years or so hasnt exceeded that of 
most increases in incomes 
price no doubt has a lot to do with the falling homeownership 
rate especially for younger people since 1980 ownership for 
those aged 25 years to 29 years dropped to 359 percent from 432 
percent for households aged 30 years to 34 years the rate dropped 
to 532 percent from 611 percent 
the down payment is the big obstacle once a house is owned it 
may cost no more to finance and operate than a rented apartment by 
deferring taxes it is argued young couples can at least get a 
foot in the door 
anyone who came through the great depression of the 1930s might 
be inclined to have little sympathy for this predicament since a 
house of any kind was out of the question for most of them but why 
use that period as a criterion 
a more cogent argument is that a home is both shelter and 
retirement fund it can be lived in during working years and in 
retirement the house can become an annuity to support the owners as 
their incomes fall 
reverse mortgages the financial instrument for utilizing home 
equity have existed for at least a decade although with little 
popularity those who have them withdraw equity on a regular basis 
to finance daytoday expenses 
the flaw in the houseasretirement thesis is that preretirees 
might tap the equity to finance expenses during their highincome 
years with interest tax deductible incidentally leaving little 
for retirement years 
the housing lobby is strong however and is dedicated to making 
housing a national commitment through legislation it isnt likely 
to retreat from the challenge since safeguards against abuse could 
be built into an ira law

a decade after agreeing to desegregate their 
university systems georgia and five other southern and border 
states still fall short of the goals 
the six states have been chastised by the us education 
department for lagging in improving largely black colleges and in 
better integrating the races at all public colleges 
the president of one mostly black school says money funds for 
capital improvements is the key billy black president of albany 
state college noted that the georgia legislature usually approves 
only half the budget requested by the university system of georgia 
theres no question but that these schools up until recently 
were neglected black said in an interview at the campus here in 
southwestern georgias pecangrowing country 
if you have a coupleofhundredyear history of being 
underfunded youll probably need some catchup money to be 
competitive he said 
but fatter budgets are not the only route to racial balance 
georgia is also exploring another avenue outright merger of such 
black colleges as albany state with nearby white institutions 
h dean propst chancellor of the state university system is 
expected to make final recommendations on mergers in may 
the education department report in february sharpened the focus 
on progress and problems at traditionally black colleges which 
last year enrolled 217367 students and which account for 40 
percent of blacks earning degrees in the united states 
the report cited georgia missouri delaware florida oklahoma 
and virginia for such shortcomings as poor facilities on black 
campuses and failure to meet goals for recruiting blacks for 
whitedominated colleges and whites for mostly black colleges 
the goals were set in 1978 in agreements between the states and 
the federal government which had accused the states of violating 
the 1964 civil rights act 
at the time washington officials said the states though no 
longer segregating colleges by law had not eliminated vestiges of 
segregation from their dual systems of higher education 
in the february report education secretary william bennett 
asked the six governors for formal assurances they will carry out 
building repair and other projects to fulfill the plans 
samuel myers head of a washingtonbased group that lobbies on 
behalf of 117 traditionally black colleges says facilities are 
being upgraded and more programs offered at black schools 
attracting more students of all races 
but myers president of the national association for equal 
opportunity in higher education says further improvements are 
needed to ensure equal educational opportunities 
the consensus is that none of these states has done all that 
they should do or all that they said they would do he said 
in the case of georgia bennett ordered officials to 
complete a business administration building at largely black 
savannah state college 
renovate a complex at fort valley state another mostly black 
institution 
better promote transfers from predominantly white darton 
college a twoyear institution to fouryear albany state 
start an agricultural extension program administered jointly by 
the university of georgia and fort valley state 
in an interview chancellor propst said the building projects 
are in the works and other deficiencies should be easy to correct 
kay miller the chancellors spokeswoman says the capital 
improvements mean the state spends significantly more per student 
at black colleges than at other schools an annual 11315 at 
albany state for example compared with 5449 at traditionally 
white valdosta state college 
the bennett report covered 10 states four west virginia 
arkansas north carolina and south carolina were found in full 
compliance with their desegregation plans 
three other deep south states louisiana mississippi and 
alabama never submitted desegregation plans the justice 
department eventually took them to court the mississippi case was 
recently dismissed the others remain in litigation 
the education department said the 10 states covered in the 
report have spent more than 240 million enhancing black colleges 
in addition congress appropriated 732 million for support this 
year 
but after bennett made his formal assessment of progress 
critics of the reagan administration contended he should have been 
tougher on the states concentrating more on integration of 
students and less on physical improvements at black campuses 
after years of desegregation efforts albany state remains 
overwhelmingly black of 1994 students enrolled for the winter 
quarter 366 were white five were hispanic two were asian and 
three were american indians 
but the college which 10 years ago had less than 4 percent 
white enrollment has met the plans general goal of a 
20percentwhite student body and is now focusing on new buildings 
and expanded programs 
it will soon have a new campus entrance more paved parking 
lots a 6 million library and a new nursing and allied health 
center in the longer term a performing arts center a new 
administration building and a new physical education complex are

when he was a boy on the way to school in 
litchfield minn his route went by a roman catholic church it 
then seemed such an alien place that in passing it he would cross 
to the other side of the street 
now as head of his protestant denomination in a new ecumenical 
climate he confers with the pope in rome and moves about the 
vatican as a trusted friend 
the change in the short span of youth to maturity of lutheran 
bishop herbert w chilstrom depicts the swift transformation of 
christianity into a broader shared household 
i have the strong sense that i entered a home with many rooms 
and that i was privileged to go into four of them he says of his 
recent visits to four centers of the faith 
as the head of the newly merged evangelical lutheran church in 
america inaugurated in 1988 chilstrom made his getacquainted 
journey to inject a personal dimension to links with other churches 
it signified that we are part of a great family of 
christians he says 
on his january trip he visited the eastern orthodox patriarch 
demetrios i in istanbul russian orthodox patriarch pimen in 
moscow anglican archbishop of canterbury robert runcie in london 
and pope john paul ii in rome 
as a lutheran whose denomination bears the name of the 16th 
century reformer martin luther who sparked the protestant break 
from rome chilstroms reception at the vatican most pointedly 
dramatized the new ties 
his aides at the chicago headquarters of the new 
53millionmember denomination gave this account 
seated with the pope beside a desk in the papal library 
chilstrom told the story of how as a boy on the way to school he 
took to the far side of the street to avoid coming close to nuns 
outside a roman catholic church 
i consider it a gift of the spirit that i have now come 
here he told his vatican host 
the pope smiling at how old aversions had gone voiced 
optimisim about ecumenical efforts citing important progress in 
us catholicprotestant dialogues and said steps must be found to 
make unity visible 
chilstrom said he had helped officiate at the marriage of his 
lutheran niece to a catholic and hoped that someday the couple 
would be able to take holy communion together 
lack of agreement on sharing in that lords supper the central 
act of christian worship remains one of the most poignant barriers 
between rome and protestantism 
the pope said of intercommunion he was keeping that hope 
before us seemingly implying that the churches may not have to 
resolve all their theological problems before positive steps could 
be taken 
the lutheran bishop was greeted with a hug by cardinal johannes 
willebrands head of the vatican secretariat for promoting 
christian unity recalling their meetings in the us 
chilstrom also met other vatican cardinals including joseph 
ratzinger head of the vaticans section on doctrine 
he pointed to new potentialities in a study by german catholics 
and lutherans about lifting the mutual 16th century condemnations 
of each others churches a step necessary for communion between 
them 
eastern orthodox patricarch demetrios i of the ancient see of 
constantinople modern istanbul told chilstrom we meet in the 
same faith and have the same goal of celebrating the holy sacrament 
together 
in a twohour conversation with orthodox leaders chilstrom said 
lutherans are an activist church very practical minded but 
had a growing desire for spiritual deepening 
you have the gift that we need to know more about 
in moscow greeted by the ailing russian patriarch pimen and 
meeting with other russian orthodox leaders chilstrom said that 
when we reach out we learn not only about your faith but we 
enrich ours as well 
in london at lambeth palace archbishop runcie head of the 
worldwide anglican communion voiced joy at the interim sharing of 
holy communion between us episcopalians and lutherans 
in rome countering chilstroms story about his boyhood 
avoidance of a catholic church willebrands told of his own boyhood 
in holland when neighborhood protestant and catholic boys each year 
set a day for a fight 
they would line up across from each other and on signal began 
slugging away but willebrands said he and a nextdoor protestant 
lad were friends and they always made sure they were not opposite 
each other 
in more ways than one chilstrom says the trip convinced him 
that the old battlers are a lot alike he says the family of 
gods people with its rich diversity shares much in common that 
needs to be affirmed

a study by a university of akron sociologist 
finds that religion contributes to a happy life a comfortable 
marriage and a positive outlook on personal health 
based on a survey of 560 akron residents sociologist margaret 
poloma said simply feeling close to god is more important to 
overall happiness than church attendance denominational 
affiliation or specific religious creed 
she says the indications are that the frequency of prayer does 
not directly relate to a sense of wellbeing but the type of 
prayer does 
those who use a conversational type of prayer are more likely 
to feel good about their lives than those who limit themselves to 
reciting memorized prayers she says

a speckled swirling mass crossed the 
horizon at midday and circled like a huge amorphous buzzard then 
vanished over the northern hills 
weve got a swarm a locust tracker shouted at a driver and 
ordered him to speed into town with the alarm 
after 30 years of grace the locusts are back cutting a swath 
from the desert to the rich agricultural lands of north africa and 
possibly beyond 
they have settled on the doorstep of tunis the seaside capital 
on its outskirts an infested cemetery shivers with a strange new 
life 
thousands of dead locusts have washed up on beaches outside 
rome carried across the mediterranean by the same winds that 
pushed the bargou on its northward course winds determine the 
course of a locust swarm 
moving in waves from mauritania desert locusts have infested 
morocco algeria tunisia and libya they now are overrunning the 
atlantic islands of cape verde off mauritania 
the magnitude of this plague is probably greater than the one 
which struck the region in the 1950s edouard saouma head of the 
un food and agriculture organization said at his office in rome 
the 1950s plague ravaged farmlands for years 
his agency predicted a general invasion of the sahel countries 
on the southern edge of the desert in june if the north african 
swarms are not reduced before the winds shift authorities said a 
swarm covering 160 square miles was sighted in tunisia early in 
march 
the one over bargou 100 miles southwest of tunis in north 
central siliana province had settled by nightfall in the hills and 
groves of borj el amri 15 miles from the capital 
it was as big as a cloud when i saw it i got scared said 
youssef mojhanmi owner of an infested almond grove people were 
making noise burning tires to stop the locusts from settling but 
they kept coming down 
mojhanmi was happy however because his grove was saved local 
officials had enough warning and began ground spraying soon after 
the landing 
by dawn locusts were dropping in mounds under mojhanmis almond 
trees or clinging stifflegged to the branches tree trunks lining 
the property seemed to writhe covered with fingersized insects 
trying to escape 
high winds limited aerial spraying at daybreak but falling 
temperatures had immoblized the insects which need a body heat of 
77 degrees to take flight 
affected countries are mobilizing all available resources and 
calling for aid locusts eat the equivalent of their own weight 
every day and could devastate the food supply of north africas 
agriculturebased economies 
the fao has said 150 million is needed to fight the plague 
no official damage estimates have been available since the 
locusts first were sighted in morocco in october and there is no 
indication of widespread crop loss so far tactics have been either 
to contain the swarms in nonagricultural areas or strike them when 
they settle 
were trying to do the maximum killing at the algerian 
frontier said malek ben salah director of tunisias 
agricultural production ministry 
efforts to kill the flying hordes have led to violations of bans 
on toxic pesticides tunisian authorities acknowledge minor cases 
of poisoning attributing them to improper use of masks during 
spraying or eating chemically treated locusts 
some experts have reopened discussion on the toxin dieldrin 
suggesting its longlasting poison could break the plague cycle 
but lukas brader director of the fao locust operations emergency 
center said it would not be used 
brader said aid donors and affected governments made the 
decision at a meeting april 67 sponsored by the un agency 
since the locusts arrived march 8 tunisia has mounted a 
veritable war with a national command post regional situation 
rooms watch committee and a council that is led by the prime 
minister and includes the defense minister 
the us agency for international development sent a team of 
experts last week to provide technical and logistical support 
a tour with the us team revealed a patchwork of infestation 
carpets of dead and dying locusts pink brown and yellow 
covered fields groves and pine forests the area stretched from 
western oases around gafsa near the algerian border where the 
locusts entered tunisia to cap bon in the northeast the nations 
breadbasket 
the situation is changing very rapidly said jeremy roffey 
the fao locust expert the swarms have moved north and many have 
blown into the mediterranean 
since flight paths are determined by the wind swarms now are 
entering tunisia through a northern corridor moving straight to 
rich farmland 
by april 3 tunisia had treated only 127300 hectares compared 
to more than 1 million treated in morocco one hectare equals 247 
acres 
mehrez chebil entomologist with the agricultural production 
ministry said the problem is much more serious with us because 
our agricultural zones are directly threatened and tunisia is 
fighting two plagues at the same time 
because of a drought afflicting the country only 18 percent of 
the land planted in cereal grains is expected to produce a normal 
harvest this year officials say 
when a swarm lands teams attack it at night with ground 
spraying and continue with aerial treatment in the morning when 
feasible national telvision tells people what to do when the 
locusts come and cars mounted with loudspeakers warn them when 
treatment starts 
this is the very beginning of a plague christopher hemming 
a british locust expert on the us team said after seeing mounds 
of dead locusts in an olive grove outside kairouan about 100 miles 
south of tunis 
local officials estimated the number of dead locusts under the 
800 trees at 460 million 
more than 250 species of locusts exist among the most 
formidable is the schistocerca gregaria or desert locust 
it is about three inches long with a wingspan of twice that 
nearly weightless and like a piranha on the land 
beginning as earthbound hoppers in larva form they 
accumulate and nestle then move into their swarming and ravenous 
phase poised for takeoff with the right combination of hot wind 
and humidity 
a swarm churning inward downward and upward can remain a 
cohesive entity for weeks 
seeing a swarm from the inside you get the impression of 
towers of locusts said hemming someone once described it as a 
column of advancing tilting cigars 
expert estimates of swarm density range from 125 million to 250 
million locusts per square mile 
most accounts trace the origin of this plague to the summer of 
1987 in regions of northern ethiopia southern sudan and northern 
chad that could not be treated because they were theaters of war

a single fluttering desert locust has 
the innocence of a hummingbird but millions in a swarm are as 
devastating to farmland as a prairie fire 
a reporter accompanied experts from the us agency for 
international development on a twoday tour of infested areas in 
tunisia which like the rest of north africa faces the worst locust 
plague in 30 years 
its netlike wings and pink brown or bright yellow shell over 
the locusts 3inchlong body are an intriguing sight up close 
although short on beauty 
visiting land infested by locusts is an experience like no 
other walking on the writhing carpet of dead or dying insects 
seeing them cling to leaves and branches with spiny black legs in 
what to a farmer is an embrace of death 
tree trunks alive with them appear to move locusts knock 
against an intruder in the desperate attempt to escape 
crawl over an obstruction and a hand comes down in a patch of 
insects settle to take a photograph and the ground crunches 
look down and they are crawling up your leg others settle on a 
companions shoulder anothers hat 
with the us team led by robert thibeault of the us office 
of foreign disaster assistance we pursued a swarm from central 
siliana province to its landing ground southwest of tunis in borj 
el amri 
after relaying a sighting over bargou to a passing motorist we 
moved on to kairouan whose local watch ommittee said the swarm had 
landed outside tunis 
up at 430 the next morning we hurried north again arriving 
for the finishing touches of an attack with insecticides on an 
infested almond grove 
millions of locusts were dead a rustling crunch underfoot but 
those that escaped the chemical fog scurried over a cemetery across 
the road

joyce zick saw it happen in her old neighborhood 
as hispanics and blacks moved in middleclass whites fled 
frightened by real estate agents fanning fears of declining 
property values 
when the panic peddlers came through my parents made a 
conscious decision to stay and live with the families who moved 
in mrs zick recalled they stayed and the property values 
declined then the neighborhood changed again and the property 
values declined again 
today mrs zick is working with a homeowners coalition lobbying 
the city council to pass a plan designed to prevent drops in 
property values and halt middleclass flight from racially changing 
neighborhoods 
but the plan known as home equity has drawn fire from 
black leaders who contend its intended to maintain segregated 
black and white neighborhoods 
its saying that as a direct result of blacks moving in the 
economic stability and vitality of a neighborhood is undermined 
said alderwoman marlene carter who is black 
im insulted by it she said i think its motivated by 
racism under the guise of economics 
supporters of the plan contend homeequity would benefit 
minority middleclass homeowners as much as whites 
under the proposal participating homeowners would pay a special 
property tax 10 to 25 a year and the money would be used to 
create an insurance fund the fund would guarantee the resale price 
of a persons home at its appraised value 
if the home sold for less than its appraised value the plan 
would allow the homeowner to collect the difference from the home 
equity fund to be protected by the fund a homeowner would have to 
maintain the house in good condition and not sell for at least five 
years 
supporters of the plan say home equity would take away the fear 
some white homeowners have that their propertys value will decline 
if the racial makeup changes in their neighborhood 
once that fear is removed homeequity supporters argue whites 
will be more likely to stay in a neighborhood when blacks or other 
minorities move in thus promoting natural integration and keeping 
the white middleclass in the city 
it doesnt matter what race you are this will protect the 
value of everyones home said alderman william banks who is 
white and who cosponsored the proposal everybodys money is the 
same color green 
the city council is weighing a proposal to establish homeequity 
pilot programs in two predominantly white neighborhoods if the 
city council doesnt act by may 1 illinois house speaker michael 
madigan says he will push for a statewide program 
the program is a psychological tool it makes people feel 
confident they wont lose their property value said philip 
nyden who studied the issue with fellow loyola university 
sociologist kathleen mccourt 
we saw this program as a way to intervene in this process and 
build stable middleincome neighborhoods that are integrated 
ms mccourt said 
nyden added that the biggest winners of the homeequity 
program would be the black middleincome homeowners who have a 
tough time finding homes and have the most to lose if their 
neighborhoods deteriorate 
oak park an integrated suburb on the western edge of chicago 
was the first community in the nation to enact a homeequity 
program ms mccourt said 
although oak park has never had to pay a claim from its 
homeequity fund she said it instituted the plan in the late 
1970s to prevent white flight when adjacent chicago neighborhoods 
became predominantly black 
the 1960s and 1970s saw real estate agents engaging in a kind of 
blockbyblock resegregation she said 
their policy was to show blacks homes on a blockbyblock 
basis after several blacks had already moved in she added 
there was a lot of panic peddling at that time white people 
being told they better sell their home quickly or they wouldnt get 
a good price for it 
mrs zick for instance says her parents were pressured to sell 
when hispanics began moving into the west side neighborhood where 
she was raised 
she says her mother now 78 resisted the tide of middleclass 
white flight and stayed until last summer but finally sold the 
family home and moved to the suburbs because crime grew so bad 
she lived under siege mrs zick said there were gunshots 
in the night and shed look out and see a dead body on the 
street 
from 1960 to 1980 chicago lost 263278 middle and upperincome 
families according to a report by the save our citiessave our 
neighborhoods coalition a homeowners group pushing the issue 
last april voters in predominantly white northwest and 
southwest chicago overwhelmingly approved advisory referendums 
calling for testing home equity in their neighborhoods 
jane sobczyk a homeowner on the citys northwest side says the 
program is widely supported in her middleclass neighborhood of 
ethnic polish filipinos italians mexicans and puerto ricans 
this is really talking about middleclass communities wanting 
to keep their middleclass socioeconomic base she said its 
a socioeconomic issue its not a color issue 
but ms carter contends that by requiring homeowners not to sell 
their houses for five years in order to qualify for home equity 
the program is designed to hold the line on integration 
its in some peoples interests to polarize the community and 
pit different neighborhood groups against each other said erik 
wogstad the save our cities coalitions project director for home 
equity 
ms carter and other black aldermen are painting the issue in 
white vs black terms to win political support from their 
constituents he asserted 
the chicago board of realtors which has 3000 members also 
opposes the program 
it contends federal equal housing laws have eliminated the need 
to protect homeowners from socalled panic peddling real estate 
agents and views the program as a slap in the face to 
minorities said tom hughes the boards executive vice president 
helen coston a middleclass black homeowner doesnt object to 
the program for racial reasons but says she doesnt think it would 
stabilize a racially changing neighborhood 
when she and her husband moved to the chatham neighborhood on 
the south side 30 years ago there were only a few blacks in the 
area gradually all the whites left but not because of declining 
property values which she says have doubled and tripled 
i would think probably back then the whites just didnt want 
to live around blacks she said i think if a person wants to 
move i think they would move whether or not the plan was in 
place

after years of plenty the world seems to be 
losing some of its flab the record global grain stockpiles are 
receding and consumer demand is helping push up prices a bit 
its sort of an economic twilight time an uncertain period that 
might portend another world food crisis of the sort that occurs 
periodically often when there is massive crop failure or other 
catastrophe 
on the other hand american farmers have idled millions of acres 
under government crop programs and those could be put back to work 
in short order if the need arises 
meanwhile world population keeps increasing so in the long run 
farmers will have to produce even more to fill the orders maybe 
the idled land will have to be put back into crops regardless of 
the weather blight and locusts 
a monthly supplyanddemand analysis issued last week by the 
agriculture department showed that the world stockpile of grain 
including wheat corn and milled rice is expected to be about 165 
million metric tons at the end of the 198788 marketing season 
that would be a 19 percent drop from more than 203 million tons 
left over at the end of 198687 
the overall figure includes a 32 percent drop in the size of the 
wheat inventory a 40 percent decline for rice and a 16 percent 
drop for corn 
the statistics showed that the inventory declines resulted from 
smaller harvests in 198788 and a rise in consumption 
last fall the washingtonbased consulting firm of ea jaenke amp 
associates noted in a series of articles that its too early to 
declare victory over world hunger despite what some of the 
experts say 
we do that every 10 years the jaenke report said in the 
mid1960s following massive us grain shipments to feed the 
starving in india the green revolution emerged to erase food 
deficits in south asia and create general optimism that hunger was 
a thing of the past 
but by 1974 hunger had broken out again 
there was bad weather in the soviet union and africa a poor 
fish crop off peru and of all things a grain shortfall in the 
united states the report said secretary of state henry 
kissinger called a world food conference in rome and sure enough 
the problem was solved within a year 
but in 198384 the most publicized food crisis of all 
occurred in some two dozen countries of africa the report said 
the us and other nations responded with food and money and the 
american pop music industry organized a transatlantic live aid 
concert in july 1985 that raised tens of millions of dollars 
again the pendulum swung and the hunger story disappeared from 
american television screens 
the world produces plenty of food but it comes mostly from a 
relatively few countries including the united states countries 
that have the money can afford to buy from the surplus holders in 
the third world where money is scarce hunger can be plentiful 
estimates by the united nations food and agriculture 
organization fao show that in 1985 an estimated 512 million 
people suffered from hunger and malnutrition and the effects of 
malnutrition in developing countries other than china an increase 
of 37 million from 1980 
hunger doesnt have much to do with the general availability 
of food in the world it has to do with poverty the jaenke 
report said poor countries and poor people dont eat well 
because they dont have the money 
it added the truth is that we will solve world hunger only 
with economic growth that puts money in peoples pockets and 
creates new customers for the worlds farmers 
earlier this month 200 agriculture and development experts met 
in another world food conference in brussels belgium to see what 
could be done about surpluses building up in the developed nations 
while much of the third world goes hungry 
zambian president kenneth kaunda pleaded for an end to 
economic parochialism and a greater liberalization of world 
trade he urged the big food producers not to dump surpluses on the 
third world as food aid 
instead he said selfsufficiency and development should be 
nurtured in the third world 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng called for an end to farm 
subsidies as a way of bringing about reform that view first 
advocated last year has been attacked frequetly by european 
economic community leaders 
frans andriessen the eec agriculture commissioner told the 
brussels conference that the us position was neither possible 
nor desirable and that some form of stabilization and 
protectionism will always be needed 
lyng said the united states over the last several years has been 
shifting to a more marketoriented agricuture with a fair degree 
of success 
reduced domestic price supports on feed grains rice and wheat 
and lower target prices across the board have helped discourage 
worldwide overproduction and have helped boost us sales he said 
the disruptive effect on world trade from existing policies 
has been damaging to those who can least afford it the developing 
nations lyng said thus in those countries where agricultural 
exports are the main source of revenue the increased income from 
liberalizing trade should stimulate domestic economies 
by removing agricultural subsidies the third world will have 
more to invest in other domestic and export industries he said 
domestic income growth would be stimulated and debt burdens can be 
eased

stacy keach who portrays ernest hemingway in 
a new tv miniseries is working offstage with the famous writers 
granddaughter to combat the abuse of drugs and alcohol 
just as hemingway was known for his boozing keach knows a thing 
or two about drugs 
while he was still doing the mike hammer series he was 
arrested in april 1984 in england for smuggling 13 ounces of 
cocaine he spent six months in prison in late 1985 and early 1986 
the lowest point of my life and says he has been free of 
drugs ever since 
i did an antidrug film and im still very active in the 
fight he says i just went to corpus christi texas with 
margaux hemingway to help raise money for a drug and alcohol 
program 
miss hemingway a 32yearold model was treated for alcoholism 
at the betty ford center in rancho mirage calif in december 
keach stars in hemingway a sixhour syndicated miniseries 
that will begin playing on stations across the country this weekend 
he recalls that a few years ago he and a friend were touring 
hemingways house in key west and looking at pictures of the nobel 
prizewinning writer as a young man my friend asked me 
something ring a bell i said no and he said go look in a 
mirror so when we got back to that house to film it was like deja 
vu 
keach says that three years ago when he was doing mike hammer 
he almost got a hemingway project off the ground with cbs 
then i found out danny wilson was doing this show and that he 
had me in mind for hemingway its the old cliche of being in the 
right place at the right time in a strange way i believe i was 
destined to play this part 
hemingways 16 novels and 49 short stories are still in print 
with worldwide sales of more than 1 million copies annually 
although some of his novels show signs of age his distinctively 
crisp terse actionpacked style make his short stories and 
journalistic pieces seem as relevant and as contemporary as ever 
he was a man who looked for one true sentence keach says 
he never used adjectives he tried to write the way cezanne 
painted but he was a man who turned on his friends i think it was 
the booze he helped ts eliot get started he helped f scott 
fitzgerald get back on his feet but he turned on them 
he was passionate about his work and his family he was 
sensitive although i hate to use that word because it can be 
misconstrued and when he got loaded he was a difficult person he 
was a terror i think he felt he had earned the right to live the 
way he did he got up early wrote then had breakfast and drank a 
bottle of wine 
keach gained 35 pounds for the role which he is still taking 
off he also grew a beard

his grandson describes david bengurion 
who was the force behind the founding of israel and became its 
first prime minister as an inveterate bookworm who often seemed 
oblivious to lifes realities 
yariv beneliezer who teaches film and television at tel aviv 
university said his grandfather took him to a publishing house 
every birthday after he was eight 
he would say choose whatever book you want and as many as 
you want i ended up with a big box loaded with books and then he 
would sit down and write on each book from grandpa and the 
date beneliezer recalled showing his interviewer an 
inscription from 1951 
i guess this was his way of teaching me to love books he 
never preached or said you ought to read like we do to our kids 
said the 48yearold professor the eldest of bengurions seven 
grandchildren and the only one who knew him well 
books and politics so consumed israels founding father his 
grandson said that he often seemed unaware of the value of money 
and naive about the material needs of his family 
he never carried money with him and he didnt know the value 
of money so much because he never cared said beneliezer whose 
mother was bengurions daughter geula grandmother care of the 
household 
beneliezer mentioned his own wedding where his grandfather 
beckoned him to a corner and whispered conspiratorily so what 
kind of book would you like me to give you for a wedding present 
the young man who was in the army and had very little money 
said he was astonished because i didnt need a book i needed a 
stove and a refrigerator he got his grandmother to intervene and 
the appliances were forthcoming 
bengurion never lost his sense of proportion beneliezer said 
making his point with childhood memories of celebrations nov 29 
1947 the day the united nations approved nationhood for israel 
everybody went into the streets dancing and singing and he was 
alone in his room beneliezer said my uncle came to him and 
said why dont you join the celebrating and bengurion said 
because i know what the cost will be 
bengurion who died in 1973 at age 87 also had an image of 
sternness and most visitors were afraid to waste his time by 
telling jokes or exchanging pleasantries 
thats one of the reasons people would say that he wasnt so 
friendly and that he didnt like to associate with people his 
grandson said adding that the opposite was true he would love 
to be with young people who didnt have inhibitions and would treat 
him like another youngster

american ambulance service is in such a state of 
emergency that some cities should set red lights flashing and 
sirens wailing experts say 
emergency medical service for certainly more than half the 
united states ranges from deep trouble to critical but 
stable said jack stout a miami consultant who has designed 
ambulance systems in six cities 
ems is some of the nations largest cities is in critical 
condition absolutely critical theyre out of control or broken 
down said james page chief of the monterey park calif fire 
department which handles ambulance runs and publisher of the 
journal of emergency medical services 
emergency care has improved dramatically from the 1960s when 
broken bodies were simply scooped off the pavement and whisked to 
the nearest hospital without thought to onsite care given 
todays capabilities however deaths from injury and heart attack 
are considered unacceptably high 
quality and control have fallen off with a drop in federal 
money lack of federal oversight and haphazard training according 
to some critics too many systems are plagued by mismanagement 
inefficiency poor design and simple mistakes 
one tipoff to a troubled system is access less than half the 
us population can get an ambulance by dialing 911 others must 
know the exact department or agency to call britain has used a 999 
number since 1930 
a properly organized and equipped national ems system could 
prevent 30000 heart attack deaths and 25000 deaths by injury each 
year according to estimates by the national academy of sciences 
were killing more of our own citizens in a year than were 
killed in all of vietnam said james hitlin a former paramedic 
in florida and a lobbyist for a bill to promote a national ems 
program were forfeiting lives because of disorganization 
a spot check of ambulance service in major cities by the 
associated press found 
in washington dc a man who suffered a seizure jan 17 
waited 38 minutes for a lost ambulance his family finally drove 
him to a hospital where he died callers to 911 in the capital 
city sometimes get a recorded message ambulances routinely take 30 
minutes to arrive 
in new york city where 100 ambulances are dispatched every 
hour two paramedics were disciplined for waiting for their 
sandwiches in a deli despite a call to help a man dying from a 
heart attack less than two blocks away feb 17 last august a 
70yearold woman died of heart failure after a twohour wait for 
an ambulance and three calls to ems by friends and relatives 
officials blamed a dispatching mixup and a shortage of units for 
the delay 
on the other hand 
in tulsa okla a computer knows in an instant the ambulance 
nearest an emergency instead of being parked at a station house 
each vehicle moves around under guidance of the computer which 
calculates when and where accidents and heart attacks are apt to 
happen radar tracks the ambulance shown as a magenta blip on a 
30inch electronic screen so it cant get lost ambulances must 
respond in 8 minutes 90 percent of the time or the private company 
that runs the service is fined 
seattle draws praise for its lifesaving rate fire department 
paramedics revive half the 300 people who suffer heart attacks each 
year giving them a chance to make it to a hospital about 80 of 
those 150 recover completely citizens also get involved 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation is mandatory in king county schools 
and part of health studies in seattle schools 
the type of service varies from city to city some ambulances 
are run by fire departments others as separate municipal services 
some cities hire private companies others rely on hospitals 
volunteers handle emergencies in 30 percent of the cases 
nationwide but only one of the 150 largest cities has a volunteer 
service 
as recently as the 1960s most ambulances were operated by 
funeral homes because hearses were the only rigs big enough to 
carry patients on cots care was crude and rides were 
roughandtumble 
those were the days of you call we haul thats all said 
john chew ems program director for the us department of 
transportation 
the federal government stepped in 22 years ago telling states 
to upgrade emergency services to provide some form of rudimentary 
medical care the highway safety act of 1966 was used to pressure 
reluctant states with the threat of forfeited highway money 
in 1973 the emergency medical act went further providing 30 
million over seven years to establish a nationwide ems network but 
in 1981 oversight shifted and money got tighter under the reagan 
policy of putting most federal funds into block grants 
that left the states to decide how to divvy up all preventive 
health and health services money among such programs as ambulances 
rat control and fluoridation 
ems allocations dropped 34 percent from 1981 to 1983 according 
to the general accounting office which was asked to review the 
system by democratic sens alan cranston of california and edward 
kennedy of massachusetts 
state spending has made up some of the difference since but has 
not hit previous levels the gao said 
cranston has sponsored a bill to provide 75 million for ems and 
trauma centers over three years a similar bill is pending in the 
house 
ambulance care has evolved on two levels basic life support 
offers cardiopulmonary resuscitation bandages and oxygen provided 
by emergency medical technicians advanced life support features 
highly skilled paramedics who can inject medicine restart hearts 
with electric jolts and clear airways with tubes 
the country has 400000 emts and 35171 paramedics federal 
guidelines suggest 110 hours of training for emts as many as 1000 
hours for paramedics only 30 states require certification through 
a written and practical test for paramedics given by the national 
registry of emergency medical technicians 
in some states paramedics get less schooling than hairstylists 
in ohio for example hairstylists train 1800 hours for a license 
a paramedic needs only 1000 hours 
there are very few jobs where somebodys life is in hands that 
take less training said william burns of the national registry 
to get better performance some cities have turned to private 
companies pinellas county fla which includes tampa and st 
petersburg pays hospital corporation of america 727000 a month 
for ambulance service 
theres no incentive to be efficient in the public sector 
said robert forbuss president of the american ambulance 
association and head of a private ambulance company in las vegas 
nev theyre at the mercy of unions and civil service you cant 
fire the fire department if it does a bad job 
about 65 percent of ems providers are volunteers but paid 
professionals cover the largest cities and care for 70 percent of 
the population according to the federal government 
increasingly towns are abandoning volunteer systems due to 
demand for more sophisticated care and to fewer people who can 
balance the demands of regular jobs with the time needed for 
emergency work 
the volunteer system is crumbling theres no place for 
volunteers in a professional service said patrick kennedy 
president of a private ambulance company that serves reading pa 
were not making cookies or putting out fires out here you 
can rebuild a building you cant rebuild a life

the sick junkie was dying from a bad batch of 
heroin but when paramedic bill jones rescued him by injecting an 
antidote he got no thanks for his trouble 
i was saving his life but he was mad at me for ruining his 
high jones said with a laugh 
but if you can prevent one death from happening that day 
weve accomplished something when i save a human life i get a 
high you would never believe said jones 40 who has also 
delivered 27 babies in his 10 years as a washington dc 
paramedic 
paramedics and emergency medical technicians are the front door 
of medical care they are the eyes ears and arms of doctors their 
ambulances are emergency rooms on wheels 
they never know if the next alarm will be a heart attack car 
wreck shooting stabbing or cobra bite sometimes its less 
urgent hemorrhoids cut fingers stubbed toes bleeding moles 
splinters or people who use them as taxis to the hospital 
this is the front line its dodge city we try to beat the 
devil on every call said calvin haupt an emergency medical 
technician here 
they see the worst life has to offer as a routine part of 
their job said john cavenagh director of washingtons emergency 
ambulance bureau 
not all of it is as heroic as the life portrayed on the old 
television show emergency 
that program glorified everything no one ever died id never 
lose a life either if i could edit the film said bo pounds who 
runs the metro ambulance service in marietta ga 
its a highrisk highstress occupation theres high 
burnout lots of divorce lots of alcholism lots of suicide but 
its exciting work the red lights and sirens syndrome said 
john chew an emergency medical services specialist with the us 
department of transportation 
ems is more dangerous than police work more hazardous than 
firemens work and more stressful than both put together said 
frank fishburne president of local 3721 of the american federation 
of government employees in washington 
on march 19 two new york paramedics trying to aid a manhattan 
man whod slashed his left wrist were attacked by three men who 
felt the ems treatment was not to their satisfaction said 
police spokesman john clifford 
one paramedic suffered a sprained wrist the other was cut and 
bruised the three men were charged with seconddegree assault 
paramedics require about 1000 hours of training to be 
certified their pay ranges from 21000 to 40000 they 
frequently work 24hour days and not surprisingly they seek the 
same esteem given police and firefighters 
in new york city paramedics were angered when mayor edward koch 
called them ambulance drivers who didnt deserve the same pay as 
police and firefighters 
they want to be recognized as legitimate professionals they 
want to be recognized for the risks they take and the lives they 
save said dr alexander kuehl vice president of the health and 
hospitals corporation the new york agency that runs the ambulance 
program 
ems is a young persons occupation people are very 
enthusiastic at 20 at 40 its hard to lift a person down 17 
flights of stairs kuehl said theyre exposed to physically 
taxing work and danger 
so why do it 
we do it because we like it said fred hurtado 41 a 
paramedic for 15 years in los angeles and a former navy medic 
you get a special feeling when you know you made a difference and 
kept someone from getting their ticket punched

the citys traumatized 911 ambulance service has been a 
spectacular citywide disaster for longer than anyone cares to 
remember 
washington post editorial 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
blood streamed from mozone kellys mouth and 
nose his frantic family called 911 for an ambulance they called 
again and again 
after 38 tortuous minutes they gave up waiting for an ambulance 
that twice drove to wrong locations in a series of blunders jan 
17 two brothers wrapped the unconscious kelly in blankets and 
drove him to a hospital he died an hour after the first call 
it seemed like minutes were hours i wouldnt feel so bad if 
the ambulance had showed up said anne glover kellys mother 
i could accept it if my brother was dead on arrival added 
macleta oliver but i cant accept them saying they were just 
lost im outraged at this incompetence 
mr kelly got caught up in a system thats got too many faults 
in it said william jones 40 a paramedic and officer of local 
3721 of the american federation of government employees 
washingtons emergency ambulance bureau is among the nations 
busiest last year it made 142000 runs in a city of 626000 
critics say it is also among the nations worst some ambulances 
take 30 minutes or more to arrive because of disorganization and 
lost crews 
a frustrated jones called it crisis management at its worst 
dr howard champion head of washington hospital centers trauma 
unit said its faults were an institutionalized litany of 
incompetence dr joy drass a colleague called it a national 
disgrace 
some items 
dispatching callers to 911 at peak times sometimes get a taped 
message advising them to wait for the operator its kind of hard 
when a recording is telling you to hold the line when your husband 
is holding his chest and turning blue jones said 
last march a dispatcher was fired for telling a man whose 
stepmother was dying of heart failure hey hey grow up 
paramedics did not arrive until 27 minutes after the first of three 
calls 
training in june an entire class of 14 emergency medical 
technicians failed a national certification test until this year 
medical technicians were given two hours of map training on city 
streets its now 40 hours 
management fifteen directors have headed the service since 
1974 including one for two hours on a friday afternoon we are 
forever changing heads and never getting to the problem said 
frank fishburne president of the paramedics union 
in february mayor marion barry stripped control of the 
ambulance bureau from the fire department and placed it under the 
city administrator the shakeup came after the mayors committee 
overseeing city emergency services voted 54 it had no confidence 
in fire chief theodore colemans management 
the system should be junked according to critics such as robert 
forbuss president of the american ambulance association an 
industry group for private ambulance services 
you just need to start over its flawed beyond fixing until 
they have a major overhaul said forbuss i dont care if 
superman is running it its clear they have no idea what theyre 
doing 
john cavenagh former ems director in philadelphia was hired in 
october to run washingtons system and has a 2year plan to turn 
it around 
the elements of an excellent system are all here it remains 
only to assemble those elements into a cohesive system he said 
cavenagh maintains that help is on the way though not as much 
as hed like 
the bureaus budget this year was increased from 94 million to 
128 million but that was 22 million less than requested the 
city has 33 paramedics cavenaugh will hire 32 more although he 
wanted 65 new posts 
he called mozone kellys death an isolated incident a very 
unfortunate but isolated incident 
in that episode the family called three times from 9 to 910 
am after kelly had a seizure 
the dispatcher gave an inexact address and firefighters advised 
the departing ambulance crew to try a location two miles from 
kellys home they twice drove to wrong locations 
what should have been an eightminute trip took 38 minutes 
kelly 38 the father of two was already on his way to the 
hospital in his brothers car 
one of the crew was later suspended for 10 days the other for 
five

a 70yearold woman died of heart failure while 
waiting two hours for an ambulance summoned in three frantic phone 
calls from relatives and friends 
the delay last august was blamed on a dispatching mixup and a 
shortage of units in a system that handles 100 emergency calls 
every hour 
new york citys response time kills people its a killer a 
genuine truebred killer said robert forbuss of las vegas 
nev who runs a private ambulance company and is president of the 
american ambulance association an organization of private 
emergency services 
but new york is not alone in needing to improve on a job where 
minutes are critical 
a spot survey by the associated press of response times showed a 
range from an average 35 minutes in milwaukee and 4 minutes in 
seattle to 104 minutes in detroit and 1356 minutes in new york 
last year 
critics say the averages are misleading some are measured from 
the time the call is made to when the ambulance arrives others 
count it from when the unit rolls discounting the time a 
dispatcher takes to screen a call 
an ambulance should be on the scene in 8 minutes experts say 
if a 10minute response time is the best you can do why 
bother to show up said james page publisher of the journal of 
emergency medical services 
time is essential because a stopped heart can be restarted by 
electric jolt within 4 to 6 minutes when a person stops breathing 
lack of oxygen damages the brain in 4 to 6 minutes a trauma 
patient can bleed to death if help is late 
here are capsule looks at three troubled ambulance systems 
new yorks response times have improved the city upgraded its 
dispatching system and separated lifethreatening calls from 
nonemergency ones saying the critical calls are answered in less 
than 6 minutes 40 percent of the time the time starts when the 
unit leaves not when the call comes in 
its improved but there are too many individual cases where 
people wait an inordinately long time said saul stern spokesman 
for city council president andrew stein a critic of the service 
in july an ambulance took 60 minutes to answer us attorney 
rudolph giulianis plea for help for a friend suffering chest pains 
unless i were reassured that this problem has been cured i 
would seriously consider getting a taxi or my car and going right 
to the hospital giuliani said 
in february two paramedics were disciplined for waiting for 
their sandwiches in a deli despite a call about a heart attack two 
blocks away the man died 
thats just two stupid idiots said bo pounds who runs the 
metro ambulance service in marietta ga if two guys worked for 
me and they were eating sandwiches i wouldnt discipline them 
id fire them you dont need breaks when people are out here 
dying 
detroit has also improved the average dipped from 104 
minutes to 86 minutes this year six extra ambulances were 
deployed at peak times and one 24hour ambulance was added 
response times were horrendous they were inhumane compared 
to what we were weve improved 90 to 100 percent said jeff 
white of michigan ambulance one of six private companies that 
handle overflow calls when city crews are busy 
detroits 9 millionayear ambulance service has just one 
fulltime advanced life support unit for 11 million people a 
second unit is available 12 hours a day and the city has 19 units 
offering a lower level of care 
for 9 million of taxpayers money you get absolutely 
nothing except maybe a happy union said jack stout a miami 
consultant who has designed ambulance services in six cities 
in broward county fla officials plan to take over a system 
run by three private companies who serve 60 percent of the county 
around fort lauderdale the reason slow response 
the companies breach a 10minute response limit 30 percent of 
the time according to browards emergency services division the 
8 million takeover will replace the companies in three stages 
ousting the slowest company first 
broward emergencies are handled by a twolevel system county 
paramedics treat patients at the scene while private ambulances 
ferry them to hospitals 
in one recent case the daughter of an anesthesiologist from 
broward general hospital had a heart attack at home her father 
worked to revive her until paramedics arrived 
the ambulance took 34 minutes to get there by then the woman 
was dead 
they got lost said pierce adams spokesman for the county 
paramedics

behind the stern granite face of the allegheny 
county courthouse and jail kate soffel whispered her 
turnofthecentury scheme of passion and escape with the 
imprisoned biddle boys 
more than eight decades later and four years after the movie 
mrs soffel her courthouse on sunday marks 100 years since 
completion the last major work by henry hobson richardson who 
helped shape american architecture 
you know a richardson building when you see it either that or 
a copy of one said george white current architect of the us 
capitol 
richardson was said to be aiming for a dignified pile of 
rocks the result was the fortresslike blocklong courthouse 
and jail joined by a great stone walkway over ross street that is 
still known by grimfaced prisoners and passersby as the bridge 
of sighs 
other famous richardson works include trinity church in boston 
marshall field wholesale store in chicago city hall in albany 
ny and town hall in north easton mass 
many late 19th century buildings imitate richardsons revival of 
the medievel european roman style that came to be known as 
richardsonian romanesque 
architect frank lloyd wright was said to be enchanted by the 
courthouse calling it worth all the other buildings in 
pittsburgh put together 
it might have been pittsburghers of the 1880s were horrified by 
richardsons extravagant plans and the 23 million pricetag 
expensive 8footlong granite slabs used to build the arches 
were displayed on street corners by critics according to james w 
knox a county planning director who has worked in the courthouse 
for 42 years 
they said the halls were too big the courtroom ceilings were 
too high knox said 
but pittsburgh led the nation in iron work and steelmaking and 
officials wanted a grand courthouse to serve the growing city 
and yet after being selected from about 100 american 
architects richardson died a year before the building was 
completed let me but have time to finish pittsburgh and i should 
be content without another day he supposedly lamented in his 
last days 
in january 1901 mrs soffel the wife of the jails warden 
engineered the escape of handsome jack and ed biddle who were 
awaiting the hangman for murder 
with them she fled about 30 miles north before police shot the 
men down mrs soffel was wounded and recovered to serve two years 
in prison 
diane keaton and mel gibson acted out the torrid tale in the 
movie producers returned to the original setting closed down ross 
street hauled in mud to cover asphalt and concrete and sprinkled 
manmade snow on stone in the summer sun 
today what had been mrs soffels bedroom is jail administrator 
ed urbans office only the homey fireplace hints that the room 
once served as living quarters 
this place has an amazing history said urban who has 
collected old photos records and letters detailing a century of 
life and death in the jail 
one record notes that a few years after mrs soffel went astray 
william j byers was being hanged for murder on a wooden scaffold 
in the courtyard when the noose slipped and he fell 10 feet to the 
ground cold water brought him back to decidedly unheavenly 
surroundings 
where am i i cant be dead i seem to be living the record 
quotes byers as saying a few minutes later he was hanged 
efficiently 
today guards still carry heavy brass rings with keys that have 
locked the jails 620 cells since richardsons time 
across the street the courthouses 325foot tower houses a 
183bell carillon and the smaller towers as richardson had 
planned store official records 
hes the first really creative american architect who created 
an architectural idiom that then became not only national in style 
but international said william h pierson an architectural 
historian and author in williamstown mass 
his great genius as an architect was that he was able to solve 
very practical problems and at the same time give those buildings a 
very powerful evocative romantic expression said richard 
cleary an architectural historian at carnegie mellon university 
the interior of the courthouse and jail has changed much since 
richardsons day the original 27foot courtroom ceilings for 
example have been dropped to 12 feet 
more than 1000 people work in the courthouse the corridors 
often are crowded and the cranky elevator breaks down periodically 
but county clerk donald glunt says no one minds much 
ive never heard anybody say oh this building is so old or 
the ceilings are too high he said 
you really feel that this is the peoples courthouse and 
there is nothing like it anywhere else knox said

a stronger dollar weakening interest rates and a wave of 
computerized program trading has pushed the stock market to its 
highest levels since the october market crash 
a late rally sparked by program trading sent the dow jones 
industrial average up 1409 to 211008 its first close over 2100 
since the oct 19 crash the rise brought the widelyfollowed 
indexs gain over the past six sessions to about 130 points 
stocks rallied even though oil prices broke the 18abarrel 
barrier for the first time in four months a possible harbinger of 
higher inflation oil was pushed higher by rumors of a panama 
pipeline shutoff and opecs moves to reduce supplies 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for may delivery 
of west texas intermediate crude which jumped 101 a barrel 
monday rose another 20 cents to close at 1809 
analysts noted the dow average had flirted with the 
psychological 2100 barrier in several recent sessions but on 
tuesday investors did not back away once the key market barometer 
held above that level in midafternoon 
stock prices were mixed earlier in the session and the market 
appeared to lack direction 
analysts noted that volume remained extremely light initially 
indicating a lack of investor enthusiasm but then serving to

a twoday surge in oil prices has pushed crude 
over the 18abarrel barrier for the first time since december 
although so far the rally has relied largely on words from opec 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for may delivery 
of west texas intermediate crude which jumped 101 a barrel 
monday advanced another 20 cents tuesday to settle at 1809 
it was the first time oil for the nearmonth contract closed 
over 18 since the dec 11 close of 1831 
prices also rose strongly the second consecutive day among 
refined products traded on the exchange wholesale heating oil rose 
103 cents a gallon to close at 4891 cents and wholesale unleaded 
gasoline rose 112 cents a gallon to close at 5207 cents 
its just a perception change about what opec is saying and 
doing said richard redoglia an analyst at merrill lynch energy 
futures in new york the perception has waned back and forth 
because usually any statement they make is discounted but the 
market heard something we havent heard before 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries said it had 
invited eight nonopec exporters to a meeting april 23 to discuss 
coordinated strategies for reducing output and forcing prices up 
news of the meeting monday was a key reason for the markets rally 
the carryover in tuesdays trading was aided by a report that 
norway an important nonopec producer that wasnt among the eight 
exporters invited to the meeting would send an observer the 
report by norways national news agency added to the possible 
significance of the meeting traders said 
prices also advanced on rumors apparently unfounded that a 
crucial transpanama oil pipeline would shut down the rumors 
stemmed from an incident at a us military base in the troubled 
central american nation in which a marine guard patrolling a 
petroleum storage area was shot dead 
the market is sensitive to anything to do with anything and 
nothing to do with supply and demand thats exactly whats going 
on said peter beutel assistant director of elders energy 
futures inc in new york 
some market experts have detected what they call a profound 
shift in the oil market because of opecs effort to stem an erosion 
in prices others say the fractious 13nation cartel historically 
has failed to maintain pricing discipline and the latest effort 
likely will collapse

in the old days maple sugaring consisted 
mainly of a grove of sugar maples buckets horsedrawn sleighs to 
collect them and a wood fire to boil down the collected sap 
these days on david marvins maple farm sugaring means purple 
plastic tubing vacuum pumps and a reverse osmosis unit 
this is hightech maple sugaring maybe not as romantic as a 
bucket on a tree but much more common 
there are more and more people who are using the advanced 
technology all the time said everett willard maple marketing 
specialist for the vermont department of agriculture he estimates 
75 percent of this years sap will be sucked out through plastic 
tubing instead of dripping into a bucket 
stretching through marvins sugarbush the grove of sugar 
maples are miles of green plastic tubing attached to a vacuum 
pump two vats and an underground piping system in the sugarhouse 
a reverse osmosis unit concentrates the sap before its boiled in a 
vshaped vat with steamheated copper tubing 
last year there were counties in the state that did not have a 
reverse osmosis unit i dont know if thats true now added 
sumner williams a research technician at the university of vermont 
maple research center in underhill 
the machinery is in use right now as sugar makers ply their 
trade in the waning days of the sugaring season theyre expecting 
a good year although uncooperative weather could curb the sap 
output that will surpass last years production of 275000 
gallons although they dont expect to top the 338000 gallons 
produced in 1986 
the record production was nearly 163 million gallons in 1927 
runs in the south are looking good so far there are loads of 
sap and it has been making goodtasting syrup too 
yesterday morning i called five producers in five vermont 
towns and every one of them told me they made more than last 
year everett said recently 
up north where marvin taps sugar makers had a slow start 
producers need warm days and chilly nights for the sap to flow but 
even a daytime high of 40 degrees wasnt coaxing the clear liquid 
from the trees during a late march trip through marvins sugarbush 
the runs improved a few days later perfect sugaring weather 
sent a flood of sap from the trees and producers were boiling for 
hours on end but the good luck lasted just a few days and as 
temperatures rose it looked like production wouldnt be much better 
than the yield in 1986 
in marvins sugarbush sap tubing which is often green or 
purple stretches like a psychedelic clothesline as its strung 
from tree to tree the lines are attached to the vacuum which 
helps suck sap from the tubes the sap is stored in the two large 
vats which are piped to the sugarhouse 
the reverse osmosis machine pushes the sap through membranes so 
that the relative sugar content increases from about 2 percent to 8 
percent that means less water in the sap and a lot less boiling 
time to turn it into syrup 
such innovations have grown more common as more people take up 
sugaring a trade once dominated by dairy farmers willard 
estimates the number of tree taps has at least doubled in the last 
10 years 
vermonts maple research center runs a sugarmaking operation and 
passes on production tips through meetings and publications 
marvin whose father jim cofounded the center has tried to 
keep up with the latest technology from new machinery to better 
trees one researcher dr mariafranca morselli is doing 
laboratory tests on tree varieties 
i dont foresee my planting trees that come from a test tube 
however there is a great deal of practical application to what 
shes doing and others have been doing before shes really looking 
at the importance of genetic traits in sap production and yield and 
so forth said marvin 
marvin sees this year as a watershed in the trend toward 
hightech sugaring 
if we have a good year i see people making capital 
improvements whether its a vacuum system or an evaporator he 
said however if its a poor year i think people are going to 
be discouraged 
my hope is we have just an average year he said and 
there wont be so much maple syrup that it floods the market

seeking greater operating efficiency 
westinghouse electric corp and the swiss firm abb asea brown 
boveri plan joint ventures in their multibilliondollar electric 
generation transmission and distribution businesses 
with the entrenched fixed costs and relative slow rate of 
growth in those industries a partnership is the way to go said 
julian manear an analyst in chicago for pershing amp co theres a 
sharing of resources so you dont have a duplication 
the two companies announced tuesday that they had signed a 
memorandum of understanding to proceed 
westinghouse will have a 55 percent interest and abb a 45 
percent interest in each of two partnerships abb also will pay 
westinghouse about 500 million 
one partnership will make sell and service steam turbines and 
generators for us and canadian utilities the businesses have 
current annual sales of about 700 million and employ about 5000 
people 
generally joint venturing is considered an alternative to 
divesting said hp smith of smith barney in new york they 
take a business cut it back as far as they can then if its still 
not meeting the goals they consider selling it or finding a 
partner 
westinghouses turbine business hasnt earned a lot of money 
for quite a number of years now the market is depressed and will 
stay depressed smith said 
the other partnership will involve transmission and distribution 
products including transformers meters controls and switchgear 
now sold in the united states and canada the businesses have 
annual sales of about 14 billion and employ about 11000 people 
the partnership allows abb to buy the transmission and 
distribution joint venture or westinghouse to force the sale in 
1990 
smith said westinghouse improved its transmission and 
distribution equipment business to a point where it was making ok 
money but still well below the corporate goals 
in both cases the partners will combine plants and engineering 
and marketing organizations in fully developed industries that show 
reduced growth potential 
manear said he does not expect wholesale employee layoffs or 
plant closings but foresees delays in capital spending 
john c marous who became chairman and chief executive of 
westinghouse in january recently told securities analysts the 
companys goals for 1988 include sales growth of 85 percent and 
operating profit margins of at least 10 percent 
westinghouse recently announced joint ventures in factory 
automation with the west german electrical equipment giant siemens 
ag 
smith said the joint ventures under marous are showing this 
new administration is not going to sit back and rest on the 
laurels of westinghouse 
abb headquartered in zurich was created jan 1 with the merger 
of asea ab of sweden and bbc brown boveri ltd of switzerland with 
sales of 18 billion and 180000 employees worldwide the company 
is one of the world leaders in electrical engineering 
westinghouse based in pittsburgh had 1987 sales of 107 
billion in electrical equipment defense electronics broadcasting 
and other businesses the company employs about 110000 workers

computerized program trading a strategy blamed 
by some analysts for worsening the 1987 stock market collapse has 
helped push the market to its highest level since the october crash 
a late buying surge boosted the dow jones industrial average up 
1409 points to 211008 on tuesday its first close above 2100 
since the market crashed on oct 19 the gain was the sixth 
consecutive rise for a total increase of nearly 130 points in the 
widelyfollowed market index 
after lackluster early trading a latesession flurry of program 
trading triggered a surge of stock buying that rallied the market 
such computerized trading programs seek to profit from price 
disparities between stock index futures and the stocks represented 
by the indexes 
trading volume remained light which accentuated the move upward 
once buyers did step in 
stocks also were helped by the dollars strength in foreign 
exchange and by declining interest rates in the bond market 
analysts said 
analysts said many investors are limiting their activity while 
awaiting fresh economic data such as the governments report on 
the us trade deficit for february which is due out thursday

if successful iowas underdog challenge to 
citibanks practice of bypassing that states consumer credit laws 
could wreak havoc on the credit card industrys pricing structure 
say some consumer groups and analysts 
iowa is challenging banks where theyve thus far been 
unchallenged said elgie holstein director of the washington 
dcbased consumer group bankcard holders of america its 
revisiting the whole issue 
but bankers and some lawyers maintained tuesday that iowa 
doesnt have a legal leg to stand on and that the supreme court 
already addressed the question a decade ago in dealing with 
interestrate caps 
the state filed a federal lawsuit against citibank on monday in 
an attempt to force it to obey iowa consumer credit laws when 
issuing credit cards to iowa consumers 
citibank maintains that the more lenient laws of south dakota 
where its credit card operation is based apply to its cards 
wherever they are issued 
in december 1978 in the case of marquette national bank vs 
first omaha services corp the supreme court ruled that nationally 
chartered banks could export their homestate interest rates to 
credit card customers in other states the court also barred states 
from regulating fees materially related to interest rates charges 
congress passed a law granting similar immunity to 
statechartered banks in the early 1980s 
but whether banks also can set all card fees such as late 
charges in excess of levels permitted by state laws is at issue in 
iowas suit 
this is where we get into interpretation said anita 
boomstein a banking expert and partner in the boston law firm 
gaston amp snow 
she said the banking industry probably would prevail in iowas 
federal lawsuits filed monday against citibank and three months 
ago against first national bank of wilmington in delaware 
there has been no definite case law defining whats material 
of the rates she said 
i think banks are in a good position that all of the 
financial outlook including the fees is in determination of 
interest rates 
the american bankers association expresses the same position 
contending the individual states interfere with banking competition 
by regulating credit card rates and fees 
william mcguire a spokeman for citibank the nations biggest 
credit card issuer and the flagship of the largest us bank 
holding company has refused to comment on the case except to say 
that the bank was following federal laws 
even holstein concedes iowas suits are based upon a narrow 
interpretation of the marquette decision but he commended the 
state for taking such an unprecedented stand while others have 
ignored the issue 
it was a lawsuit just waiting to happen he said 
citicorp and first national bank of wilmington arent the only 
two banks whose credit card fees and charges have surpassed the 
levels permitted by some state laws 
connecticut imposed a 15 percent limit on interest rates charged 
by local and outofstate credit card companies during 1987 taking 
the strongest action to regulate consumer credit practices eleven 
other states also passed laws regulating consumeroriented aspects 
of the credit card industry last year 
but enforcing those laws has been a different story to get 
around them banks need only base their credit card operations in 
states that have less stringent regulations and usury laws like 
delaware and south dakota said holstein 
iowa is seeking to stop citibank and first national bank of 
wilmington from applying the laws of south dakota and delaware 
respectively regarding to late payment fees and insufficient check 
charges iowa says other companies may be sued as well 
if they iowa were to win citibank may just decide not to 
issue cards in iowa which only has 36000 citibank masercard and 
visa cards anyway said stephen berman a banking analyst with 
county securities usa 
but he conceded that should other larger states take similar 
action banks and their pricing structure could face some big 
problems

investors reacted calmly to news that atampt 
chairman james e olson has undergone surgery for colon cancer and 
will be absent from daytoday management for an indefinite period 
analysts said olsons forceful style of management has set the 
company moving in the right direction although some were concerned 
that an extended absence could be harmful 
atampt confirmed newspaper reports tuesday that olson 62 
underwent surgery march 25 to remove a malignant tumor from his 
colon and was recuperating at his new jersey home while receiving 
outpatient chemotherapy 
atampts stock rose 25 cents a share to 2812 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading 
fulton holmes an analyst at thomson mckinnon securities inc 
said he was more pessimistic than other observers about atampts 
prospects without olson at the helm 
he has essentially singlehandedly turned this company 
around holmes said i have major reservations about this 
company if he ends up having to either lessen his input or turn it 
over totally to his successor 
atampt said it could not predict when olson would return to active 
duty or whether he would attend the companys annual meeting in 
denver next wednesday 
robert e allen 52 the president and chief operating officer 
is running the company in his absence 
olson has made atampt more aggressive more costconscious and 
more certain of its direction since taking office in september 
1986 analysts said 
olson landed his first job in the bell system at age 17 
cleaning silt out of manholes in north dakota and is considered a 
takecharge executive with an emphasis on getting results 
i think olsons personality has begun to permeate throughout 
atampts organization said jack grubman an analyst for 
painewebber inc 
olsons undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of william 
mcgowan the chairman of mci communications corp who suffered a 
heart attack in december 1986 received a heart transplant and 
returned to office in september 1987 
both companies drew criticism for failing to announce their 
chiefs illnesses until news leaked out to the press 
the new york times and wall street journal reported olson was 
ill in their tuesday editions 
atampt spokesman bill mullane who confirmed olsons illness when 
asked about the reports said lawyers assured him the matter did 
not need to be disclosed because it was not considered material 
under the law 
mullane said olson has kept up some correspondence from his home 
and would be available in case of a crisis 
if there was a critical issue that had to be discussed with 
him today it would be discussed with him just as if he were in 
fiji on vacation mullane said 
securities and exchange commission spokesman chiles larson said 
the illness of a chief executive is not specified as a matter that 
automatically requires disclosure he declined to comment tuesday 
on whether the sec was investigating the appropriateness of atampts 
actions 
the absence of olson is less significant to atampt than mcgowans 
absence was to mci the distant secondplace contender in the 
longdistance communications market said daniel rosenbaum 
executive editor of wiretap a morristown njbased newsletter 
atampt is a much more mature company it has executives in place 
who can pick up the slack rosenbaum said

the united auto workers union has blasted ford 
motor co as having greedy shortsighted instincts for 
awarding nearly 248 million in bonuses to its executives for 1987 
vice chairman harold poling was fords top earner for 1987 with 
compensation of 108 million including 8060272 from exercise 
of stock options cash bonuses of 2 million plus salary and 
benefits totaling 808697 according to a proxy statement mailed 
tuesday to ford shareholders 
ford chairman donald petersen received the largest cash bonus 
for 1987 28 million in addition to 929934 in salary and 
benefits ford disclosed 
ford said it awarded 2479 million in cash bonuses to 5166 
executives or an average of nearly 48000 each ford will 
distribute half of each bonus friday and half in january unless an 
executive has the payments deferred 
in 1986 ford awarded 5528 executives 1643 million in bonuses 
petersen said that while the increase in bonuses appeared to be 
large the nations secondlargest automaker believed they were 
warranted by the companys record profits in 1987 
but in a written statement united auto workers union president 
owen bieber and vice president stephen p yokich who directs the 
unions ford department said the bonuses send the wrong message 
to workers and consumers 
when it comes to executive compensation fords behavior shows 
the same greedy shortsighted instincts that almost all american 
corporations exhibit they stated 
we just dont believe that mr petersen or anyone else is 
worth over 100 times as much as a uaw production worker is worth to 
ford 
ford earned a company record 46 billion last year boosting 
its 1986 earnings by 41 percent and outperforming industryleader 
general motors corp for the second consecutive year 
last month ford distributed profitsharing checks amounting to 
a record 636 million to more than 156000 hourly and salaried 
workers in the united states making for an average check of just 
more than 4000 each 
gm announced feb 9 that although its profits rose 206 percent 
to 356 billion in 1987 it earned too little on its us 
automaking business to trigger profitsharing payments to workers 
but gm said it would give stock valued at 1846 million to 
about 5000 of its top executives 
chrysler corp the nations thirdlargest car maker is 
expected to issue its proxy statement next week chrysler which 
does not have a profitsharing plan in its union contract posted a 
71 percent decline in its 1987 profit to 129 billion 
petersen poling and 42 other ford executives received cash 
bonuses totaling 299 million for 1987 in addition to salaries and 
benefits amounting to 129 million that compares with 45 top 
executives receiving 195 million in bonuses and 113 million in 
salaries and benefits in 1986 
in 1986 petersen received a 13 million cash bonus in addition 
to 660772 in salary and benefits poling got a 11 million bonus 
and earned 531327 in salary and benefits 
the proxy statement was issued in advance of fords may 12 
annual meeting in detroit

a national association of securities dealers 
task force is urging the federal government to impose rules for 
brokerage firms that would help thwart illegal insider trading 
in a report on tuesday the nasd regulatory review task force 
said many brokerage firms already had socalled chinese wall 
procedures designed to keep sensitive information from leaking from 
a firms mergers and acquisition staff to its trading staff 
but the report said neither the securities and exchange 
commission nor selfregulatory organizations such as the nasd 
which operates the overthecounter stock market have established 
standards for chinese wall procedures 
regulators must do a better job of making sure the information 
barriers are effective said the task force which began work a 
year ago and was headed by aa sommer jr a securities lawyer and 
former sec commissioner 
it also recommended 
requiring firms to more expeditiously announce news that could 
affect the price of their stocks thus cutting down on the 
opportunity for illicit trading 
improving nasd computer programs designed to detect unusual 
stock trading 
abolishing limits on nasd fines for insider trading 
making disciplinary records of brokers more readily available 
to the public 
passing legislation making it easier to restrict reentry into 
the securities business of brokers found guilty of serious 
misconduct

roger wilson paid his taxes but refused to pay the late fee and 
his business was shut down by authorities march 17 the next day 
wilson paid the fee and reopened his business 
wilson said he was pleased to hear about the refund but even 
happier that the city council is considering a measure that would 
establish new policies restricting the treasurers authority to 
seize property 
its scary when a person like that has the authority to 
mobilize a police force to take her point of view to the limit

armand hammer chairman of occidental petroleum 
corp today signed an agreement with the soviet government on a 
joint project to build a pair of plastics factories worth as much 
as 200 million in the ukraine 
hammer said the two plants which are expected to begin 
operating in 1991 would help improve the supply of consumer goods 
to the soviet public 
if socialism is to succeed in russia you must improve the 
standard of living of your people hammer told alexander 
ustkachkinzev first deputy minister of the soviet chemical 
industry after signing the agreement 
hammer who has had business dealings with the soviet union 
since the 1920s told a news conference he is convinced the soviet 
union is committed to making joint ventures succeed 
us commerce secretary c william verity and a group of 400 
american business leaders are in moscow this week for meetings with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and other officials on expanding 
trade relations 
the soviets are actively seeking joint business projects with 
capitalist countries in an attempt to revive their stagnant economy 
with more and better quality products 
there are few joint sovietus business ventures but on 
monday honeywell inc announced a joint venture to supply 
automated production controls for soviet fertilizer factories and 
on tuesday roma food enterprises of piscataway nj began selling 
pizza in moscow from a mobile van 
in addition seven major us companies today announced they had 
formed the american trade consortium an umbrella under which 
ussoviet joint ventures will be negotiated to produce consumer 
goods ranging from cookies to cars 
no new joint ventures have been signed yet but negotiations are 
under way on several said consortium president james h giffin of 
the mercator corporation 
the other six companies involved are chevron overseas rjr 
nabisco ford motor company eastman kodak archer daniels midland 
and johnson and johnson 
the two plastics plants to be built near kalush not far from 
the czechoslovak border will produce polyvinyl chloride or pvc 
said hammer 
one will produce film for food packaging wall coverings pond 
and reservoir linings while the other will produce resins for 
vinyl flooring upholstery fabrics and molded vinyl items the 
company said in a statement 
hammer said occidental is the largest producer of pvc in the 
united states 
the estimated cost of the plants is between 160 million and 
200 million hammer said threequarters of the plants capacities 
will be sold in the soviet union and its allied countries but 
occidental will receive 25 percent to sell on the international 
market where it can earn convertible currency 
one of the major stumbling blocks to more joint ventures is that 
the soviet ruble is not convertible into other currencies so it is 
difficult for western companies to earn profits that can be taken 
out of the soviet union 
companies must make agreements to produce goods that can be sold 
outside the soviet union for hard currency or agree to take other 
kinds of soviet goods that they can sell abroad 
hammer announced in november that occidental petroleum italian 
and japanese companies would participate in another joint venture 
to build a petrochemical complex near the caspian sea 
occidental president ray irani told the news conference 
negotiations on the two plastics factories began in late 1986 but 
originally focused on another site once the focus shifted to the 
kalush site negotiations were completed in six months he said

international business machines corp today 
reported strong firstquarter earnings on sharply higher revenue 
which analysts called an important signal that the worlds largest 
computer company is snapping back after a disappointing slump

i think its very very good said peter labe a computer 
analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc in new york its a better 
revenue gain than anybody was expecting

because they followed a string of lowerthanexpected results for 
the company and came during a quarter that historically is the 
weakest in the computer industry 
the gains in earnings and sales also came despite a higher tax 
rate and fears of a businessspending cutback in the aftermath of 
the stock market crash six months ago 
on the new york stock exchange ibm jumped 137 to 115 a 
share in heavy trading a reflection of investor confidence 
ibms business continues to improve chairman john f akers 
said in a statement from the companys world headquarters in 
armonk ny we are pleased that customers are responding

finance leaders from the worlds top 
industrial countries met today in rare harmony for a session at 
which they were expected to reaffirm a fourmonthold pact that has 
successfully stabilized the value of the dollar 
the finance ministers and heads of the central banks of the 
seven nations were meeting at a session hosted by treasury 
secretary james a baker iii 
japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa told reporters before 
the meeting started that he expected cordial discussions with 
little disagreement 
the conference will not be so difficult unlike the others we 
have had before he said 
german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said he was looking 
forward to good discussions 
the meetings began with a session of the group of five 
countries the united states japan west germany britain and 
france they were joined later in the morning by italy and canada 
in the past wrangling between the countries over interest 
rates proper currency levels and trade imbalances has sent 
financial markets into an uproar 
but this time there appear to be no major disagreements 
americas allies are happy that the country is finally making 
progress to reduce its huge federal budget deficit which they 
blame for keeping world interest rates high and the reagan 
administration has been pleased that japan and west germany are 
doing more to stimulate growth in their countries actions expected 
to reduce the huge us foreign trade deficit 
the seven nations pledged dec 22 in a communique worked out 
longdistance to support the value of the dollar at its current 
leels that pact has been working lending reassurance to jittery 
financial markets 
there had been fears that the global collapse of stock markets 
on oct 19 would lead to a worldwide recession in 1988 but that 
doomsday scenario failed to materialize 
the world economy is growing at a faster pace than expected 
while a relentless downward slide in the dollar which contributed 
to last falls market turmoil has been at least temporarily halted 
the major industrial countries of the world obviously favor 
stability of exchange rates and we have been very pleased with the 
stability we have seen since december baker said monday 
while the industrial countries have repeatedly professed a 
harmony of views over the past three years their disagreements 
over currency values trade imbalances and interest rates have 
often roiled financial markets 
the administration and its economic allies launched an effort in 
september 1985 to push the value of the dollar down as a way of 
reducing the soaring us trade imbalance believing that a weaker 
dollar would curb americans appetite for imports while making us 
goods more competitive on overseas markets 
the administration formally abandoned that push in february 1987 
at a meeting in paris with its economic allies 
however the dollar continued to slide for much of 1987 often 
lurching downward with each monthly release of the latest us 
trade deficit total showing the imbalance between what the country 
imported and what it sold abroad was remaining at stubbornly high 
levels 
this convinced financial markets that despite the 
administrations public pledge it secretly wanted the dollar to go 
lower 
the falling dollar raised inflation fears in this country and 
prompted the federal reserve last september to boost interest 
rates the turmoil involving the dollar and higher interest rates 
are often cited as two factors which helped spark the october stock 
market collapse 
the collapse served as frightening evidence of the dangers in 
economic disunity and spurred a dec 22 pledge by the top economic 
powers to work harder to keep the dollar from falling further 
that commitment was backed up by massive intervention in 
currency markets the process by which governments buy weak 
currencies to prop up their value 
in addition to reaffirming the december pact the finance 
ministers are also expected to review and perhaps agree to a novel 
idea first advanced by baker last september to use the price of 
gold and other commodities to help the top economic powers 
coordinate their policies 
baker has stressed that he is not proposing a return to a gold 
standard the system by which currencies were stabilized for a 
quarter century following world war ii 
rather baker has said the commodity basket of goods should be 
added to the other economic indicators the countries have been 
using since the tokyo economic summit in 1986 to measure their 
performances this group of indicators includes individual growth 
rates inflation and trade balances 
bakers commodity basket of products including gold would 
introduce a pricesensitive measure into the economic planning 
process if commodity prices were rising in particular countries 
they would be encouraged to boost interest rates to fight 
inflation but if commodity prices were failing in certain 
countries those nations would know they had room to cut interest 
rates and stimulate economic growth 
some countries in particular west germany have opposed the 
commodity index seeing it as a device whi in one new initiative on third 
world debt world bank president 
barber conable announced tuesday the formation of a new worldwide 
agency to insure private investors against loss from war and other 
hostile actions 
conable said the new multilateral investment guarantee agency 
which will start with 108 billion would attract more direct 
investment into third world countries by issuing insurance policies 
to protect investors

commission wednesday threatened to take its opposition to japanese 
taxes on car imports to the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
if japan does not answer eec complaints within two weeks 
eec external affairs commissioner willy de clercq will raise the 
issue at a meeting with japans commerce minister hajime tamura in 
vancouver british columbia this weekend an eec spokeswoman said 
us canadian eec and japanese officials will meet for trade 
talks in the canadian city 
japan levies special taxes on cars with engines bigger than 2 
liters and a width of more than 17 meters as most european cars 
imported by japan exceed these measures the eec finds the taxes 
discriminatory 
the eec spokeswoman said the eec believes the tax unduly 
penalizes eec imports in various ways and might take the matter 
to gatt if it does not get a satisfactory answer by the end of the 
month 
gatt is a 94nation organization that oversees international 
trade 
on another issue de clercq will seek a japanese pledge in

recent news coverage about several 
airlines complaints concerning defects in boeings widebody 747 
and 767 jetliners was due partly to boeings open way of dealing 
with its problems company officials say 
furthermore more boeing workers are now aware of items that 
need improving phil condit boeing commercial airplanes executive 
vice president said tuesday 
air transportation is the safest transportation mode there 
is and is getting even safer because airlines manufacturers and 
regulatory agencies work together to identify and correct problems 
condit said 
boeings news conference came one day after the federal aviation 
administration confirmed it has issued 50 airworthiness directives 
in the last two years telling airlines to fix various problems with 
boeing jets 
the most recent warning issued friday concerned possible fuel 
leaks in the cargo area of boeing 747200s the leaks can be caused 
by a bolt giving way in a wing section and airlines using the jets 
were ordered to inspect them before returning the planes to service 
boeing officials said the order applied to 317 operating 
747200s 
airlines boeing and faa officials have said none of the defects 
cited to date has been linked to a crash or other major damage 
condit said that as soon as a problem is discovered boeing 
corrects it and notifies all operators of the plane along with 
regulatory agencies 
boeing which had more than 50 percent of the worldwide 
commercial jet market last year writes about 1000 service 
bulletins annually to point out improvements or possible problems 
condit said most are minor but he said some are serious enough to 
require an airworthiness directive to ensure all carriers check for 
the problem 
condit said the recent reports presented only a snapshot 
view of boeings ongoing process of checking its planes to see how 
they can be improved 
because boeing has become more open with its work force sharing 
customer complaints and asking for employees advice on solving 
problems its more likely that word of such problems will reach 
the public he said 
in addition boeing this year started an audit of its 
aircraft testing procedures to make sure problems arent falling 
through the cracks condit said 
last year boeing added more than 3000 workers at its everett 
widebody plant bringing employment there to about 14000 said 
william shineman vice president and general manager of the everett 
division another 500 to 1000 will be hired this year he said 
he and condit acknowledged that as boeing increases 747 and 767 
production theres an increased potential for defects until 
production methods new staff and suppliers are brought to speed 
the faa monitors manufacture of us civilian aircraft to ensure 
they meet design specifications nick wantiez of the seattle faa 
office said tuesday that in recent months the agency expanded 
those investigations at boeing to include the recent airline 
complaints which range from wrong parts to incorrectly installed 
firefighting systems 
he said the most recent directive came after reports of 
complaints by japan air lines northwest airlines lufthansa air 
india aerolineas argentinas and a leasing company starting nov 
21 with a jal report in los angeles of a fuel leak involving a bolt 
that had broken from corrosion 
complaints about other problems have also been sent to boeing by 
american airlines british airways jal and all nippon a domestic 
japanese carrier 
the problems cited by all nippon included a wing flap 
disintegrating in flight on the first day of service smoke from a 
misassembled power unit that caused an emergency landing and 
problems in a fire extinguisher system 
jal and american also complained about the firesuppression 
system 
condit said all of the problems reported had been fixed

retail sales spurred by gains at department 
stores and auto showrooms rose a strong 08 percent in march the 
fifth consecutive increase the government said today 
the commerce department said retail sales rose a seasonally 
adjusted 11 billion to 1307 billion 
sales were strong in all categories except furniture stores and 
restaurants and were well above expectations most economists 
before today predicted an increase of 02 percent to 03 percent 
the march increase came atop a 06 percent gain in february 
revised upward from the 04 percent estimate released a month ago 
the latest rise was the strongest since a 11 percent increase 
in december ever since the october stock market crash economists 
have watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer 
sector of the economy would weaken 
but more recently some analysts have raised fears that too much 
consumer demand could refire inflation and lead to higher interest 
rates 
much of the strength in march came from sales at department and 
other general merchandise stores boosted by an earlierthanusual 
easter their sales rose 16 percent following a 26 percent 
decrease in february 
auto sales rose 09 percent following a 20 percent increase a 
month earlier excluding autos sales were up 08 percent the same 
as the overall rise 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last three or more 
years were up 05 percent while nondurable goods were up 10 
percent 
the department offered these details of march sales 
hardware and garden supply stores up 05 percent after 
soaring 30 percent in february 
furniture and appliance stores down 20 percent after a 
strong 29 percent increase a month earlier 
food and grocery stores up 11 percent after an earlier 06 
percent rise 
gasoline up 14 percent following a 12 percent decline

at various times in the past two decades or so 
the us economy was gripped by extremes measured mainly as 
inflationary booms and recessionary busts but by lesser 
indicators too 
the savings rate dropped to historic lows unemployment reached 
doubledigit levels housing prices soared five times borrowing 
and interest rates hit record highs odd things kept happening 
throughout the economy 
seeking explanations some economic theorists came up with 
equally odd theories the most popular of them being that the 
nation had lost its work ethic and common sense and was on a 
relentless course downward 
now comes evidence that maybe what happened to produce these 
events or to exacerbate them was a factor so obvious it wasnt 
duly considered an unlikely possibility until you take into 
account the imperfections of human perception 
that unlikely cause was the baby boom of 1946 to 1964 
edward yardeni an economist for prudentialbache securities 
inc contends that the boom not only caused some of those extreme 
readings but is likely to produce a few extremes mainly positive 
for the future as well 
the baby boomers have had a tremendous influence on our 
economy says yardeni 38 years old and therefore a boomer 
himself 
undoubtedly they will continue to be extraordinarily 
influential yet most models of the economy completely ignore 
demographic trends he said 
background 
during the 19 years between 1946 and 1964 more than 76 million 
babies were born in the united states almost onethird of our 
present population this of course produced a population bulge 
that as it moved through the years produced economic change 
in the 1970s inflation roared and unemployment soared as baby 
boomers overwhelmed the job market 
they entered the labor force faster than the economy could 
create jobs says yardeni observing that the labor force rose 
113 percent in the 1950s and 18 percent in the 1960s compared 
with 30 percent in the 1970s 
as the jobless rate rose policymakers responded by stimulating 
the economy in an effort to create more jobs for the boomers 
politicians knew also that the boomers were entering another 
marketplace the political arena 
so yardeni notes economic policy became biased towards 
inflation 
inflation didnt bother the baby boomers they could beat 
inflation by getting married and bringing home two paychecks those 
two paychecks in turn gave them the purchasing power to fuel even 
more inflation 
they needed a place to live so they leveraged their paychecks 
with large mortgages for condominiums and houses forcing housing 
prices to rise even faster than the general level of inflation 
interest rates rose too 
they needed items to fill those houses so they consumed 
eagerly they needed furniture and appliances and cars and that 
didnt leave much money to save especially since they were still 
well below their peak earning years 
now as the demographic bulge moves on the baby boomers are 
growing older and leaving behind the habits of the young 
increasingly the highspending yuppies are shifting to the 
conservative savingsminded couch potato stage 
so says yardeni we can expect this within the next five years 
the savings rate will rise from the current 54 percent to 10 
percent a rate previously not reached in peacetime for any 
sustained period of time 
the jobless rate will fall to 4 percent from marchs level of 
56 percent 
increases in consumer spending should slow markedly 
home prices should rise at a much slower pace 
productivity should grow rapidly because the boomers will have 
peak skills this same factor should help keep the inflation rate 
low 
while other factors contributed to the extremes of the past two 
decades it is difficult to argue that yardenis demographics 
didnt play a very large role a role so big it seems incredible 
it wasnt given proper attention 
the message now is a pleasant one the baby boomer bulge that 
gave the economy indigestion for two decades is now spelling relief

for koppers co a pittsburghbased cement and building materials 
concern

lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank plc in launching a 
bid for the company

services company that owns an federally insured bank from taking 
more than a 5 percent equity interest in a company not involved in 
financial services 
shearson owns boston safe deposit and trust co which ranks as 
the nations 20th largest bank it also owns nearly 50 percent in 
bns the company beazer formed to make the bid for koppers 
the ridgewalgren bill also would prohibit a foreign bank 
holding company that owns a federally insured bank from using its 
financial resources to acquire interest in a company not engaged in 
financial services 
if investment banks are permitted to become full partners in 
takeover efforts through an equity interest that is to go beyond 
the traditional role of lending money corporate america will be 
controlled by banks at unprecedented levels walgren said

the federal government today announced a 
special investigation of texas air corp to determine whether the 
nations largest airline company and its management are fit 
willing and able to carry commercial air traffic 
the investigation by the transportation department came as the 
federal aviation administration announced a civil penalty of 
823000 against eastern airlines a texas air subsidiary because 
of recurring trends of violations of safety regulations 
transportation secretary james burnley told a news conference 
the investigation of texas air corp will be completed within 30 
days and is being conducted to determine whether the company is 
complying with federal regulations and whether its management is 
competent to operate commercial aircraft 
burnley said that one reason for the investigation is the faas 
fine against eastern which came just over a year after eastern 
agreed to pay a 95 million fine in connection with other safety 
violations 
in addition he said the departments concerns were raised 
after an examination of texas airs financial filings with the 
securities and exchange commission which showed the airline company 
to be under substantial increasing financial pressure 
texas air corp had record losses since the beginning of 1987 
burnley said it had a net loss of 466 million last year 
b wayne vance the departmemts general counsel said 15 to 20 
government economists and auditors will focus on texas air corps 
financial records management practices and the circumstances 
surrounding texas airs purchase of eastern and more recent 
attempts to shift eastern assets away from the miamibased airline 
in its order directing the 30day investigation of texas air 
the department said recent filings by texas air with the sec 
suggest a need to examine easterns and continentals 
financial fitness 
the recent activities of the texas air and its carriers 
particularly continental and eastern raise questions concerning 
whether the carriers can and are disposed to comply with the safety 
and economic rules applicable to air carriers the order said 
texas air which is based in houston is the parent company for 
eastern and continental airlines together these two carriers 
account for nearly 20 percent of the commercial airline market 
in a separate action faa administrator allan mcartor said the 
faa will begin an indepth 30day inspection of eastern that 
will literally touch every one of easterns 267 planes to 
determine whether they are being operated within federal safety 
requirements 
mcartor said at the same time the agency has proposed a civil 
penalty of 823000 against eastern for alleged violations already 
discovered in the miamibased airline 
the new round of inspections by faa teams was prompted by what 
appears to be recurring trends of noncompliance of safety 
regulations i am concerned about the degree to which eastern 
management systems are providing adequate supervision and control 
over easterns aircraft fleet mcartor said

cbs inc said wednesday its firstquarter 
earnings rocketed higher but the rise resulted from a huge 
onetime profit on the sale of its records group and from interest 
earned by investing cash from other asset sales 
the company said the operating profit of its broadcast group 
fell 19 percent compared with strong results a year ago 
cbs reported an aftertax profit of 9113 million or 3534 a 
share for the januarymarch period compared with earnings of 
487 million or 193 a share a year earlier revenue fell 46 
percent to 6963 million from 7297 million 
the latest results included a onetime gain of 8666 million 
mainly due to the sale of the cbs records group to sony corp the 
japanese electronics concern for 2 billion 
income from continuing operations surged to 447 million from 
78 million a year earlier but cbs said that was because it 
netted 517 million on interest income in the latest quarter 
while it had interest expenses of 93 million in the same period 
in 1987 its interest income was augmented by a pretax gain of 14 
million on the sale of treasury securities 
cbs has accumulated its cash by selling assets that are not 
directly related to its core broadcasting business over the past 18 
months it sold its book and music publishing units in late 1986 
and its magazine division in 1987 
the cbs broadcast group made an operating profit of 156 
million down from 219 million mainly because of lower results 
for the cbs television network which has seen its prime time 
ratings slump to third place behind nbc and abc for the first time 
the tv networks results a year ago benefitted from the 
inclusion of broadcasts of college basketballs and professional 
footballs championship games another network carried the super 
bowl football game this year and the cbs telecasts of the ncaa 
basketball finals occurred in the second quarter 
cbs said that net sales for the broadcast group which were off 
5 percent at 6962 million would have improved if the impact of 
the sporting events were excluded 
despite a difficult sales environment broadcast group 
earnings met our budgeted expectations said laurence a tisch 
president and chief executive officer

albert casey who piloted american airlines to 
profitability as its president during the turbulent deregulation of 
the 1970s could find the ride even bumpier as the new chief of 
ailing first republicbank corp analysts said wednesday 
texas largest bankholding company announced tuesday that it 
expects to lose 15 billion for the first quarter even after a 1 
billion emergency cash infusion last month 
in addition its top executives have left in a steady stream 
the latest on tuesday when chairman and chief executive officer 
gerald w fronterhouse resigned 
casey 68 named president and chief executive officer by the 
banks board of directors the same day has been described by 
financial analysts and former employees as both a motivator and a 
hatchet man 
he was credited with stripping fort worthbased amr corp 
americans parent company of layers of bureacracy and mercilessly 
streamlining its operations his was one of the few major airlines 
showing a profit when he stepped down as its president in 1984 
casey smiles a broad irish smile shakes hands with a firm 
grip and tells the best jokes at any dinner party said an 
executive once fired by casey but he carries a big stick and 
doesnt mind using it 
but casey is also known as a people man an executive who 
works well with others and motivates his employees 
al casey is clearly an outstanding executive who has had very 
broad experience said robert f erburu chairman of the times 
mirror co and a former casey associate he is wellversed in 
problemsolving and possesses skills as an outstanding motivator of 
people with special strengths in financial matters 
first republicbank corp presents the veteran corporate 
repairman with a daunting set of challenges 
a projected 15 billion firstquarter loss triple that of 
corporate projections 
panicked depositors whose run on first republicbank was 
stemmed march 17 by a sixmonth 1 billion emergency loan from the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
resignations of top executives including the chairman of its 
lead bank in dallas and the companys largest shareholder dallas 
cowboys owner hr bum bright 
as a condition of the emergency aid from the fdic top 
executives agreed to resign if asked following a financial 
examination of the company fronterhouses resignation timed to 
coincide with the stunning revelation of first republicbanks 
quarterly figures threw a spotlight on the new chief executive 
casey took over amr in 1974 at a time when it was topheavy with 
management layers brought on by 30 years of government regulation 
in a series of dramatic moves casey sold off holdings 
unconnected to running the airline including large unprofitable 
holdings in hotels 
when i came to american i just took the whole thing and found 
layers and layers of stuff vice chairman of subsidiaries hotel 
companies and five management consulting firms casey recalled in 
an interview with the dallas morning news not long before he 
retired from american airlines i fired them all cleaned them 
out 
during caseys 10year reign he cut americans cost per 
operating unit by 25 percent the company relocated from new york 
to fort worth and liquidated its moneylosing hotel business 
caseys whole career has been one of financial markets said 
donald j carty senior vice president at american who worked with 
casey he knows and is wellrespected by every major banker in 
the country and by every financial guru on wall street 
casey said he would spend the next few weeks reviewing the 
existing management team before making further changes at the 
company 
casey also announced the boards appointment of a new executive 
committee with casey as chairman and mark shepherd jr chairman of 
texas instruments inc the vice chairman 
the 15 billion loss projected would be the secondlargest ever 
for a us bank after citicorps 25 billion loss in second 
quarter 1987 
the bank holding company the nations 14th largest in terms of 
assets attributed the loss to a 50 percent increase in its 
loanloss provision to 231 million and writedowns from 
foreclosed properties all totaling 15 billion 
the bank reported a loss of 656 million in 1987 
fdic chairman l william seidman last month estimated that the 
first republicbank bailout will cost a total 17 billion although 
industry experts say it is likely to cost substantially more

meeting and a slate of directors will be elected to the companys 
board 
the meeting was requested by carlo de bendetti the flashy 
italian financier who announced nearly three months ago that he 
sought control of the 166yearold company which has interests in 
a third of the belgian economy 
de benedetti who heads olivetti spa claims he and his 
associates own about 49 percent of societe generales 282 million 
outstanding shares 
but an alliance led by cie financiere de suez of france and 
groupe ag belgiums biggest insurer claims to hold a 507 percent 
stake in the company 
shares will be counted for the first time at thursdays meeting 
and shareholders will establish how many of those shares are valid 
the ownership issue has been clouded by the fact that the belgian 
government does not require shareholders to identify themselves or 
their allies 
on the eve of the meeting the rival bidders tried once again to 
negotiate a settlement but were unsuccessful 
cie financiere and groupe ag are expected to claim they can 
purchase another 2 million shares that are part of a contested bloc 
of 12 million new shares issued to dilute de benedettis stake in 
the company 
de benedetti is seeking seats on the board for himself and two 
allies including andre leysen chairman of belgiums gevaert nv 
his rivals are willing to let him join management but are 
opposed to his taking control of the company 
de benedetti wants to turn societe generale into a paneuropean 
holding before 1992 when the european economic community will 
remove a thicket of regulatory curbs that frustrate free movement 
of goods and services within the community 
societe generale has its tentacles in some 1300 companies 
involved in banking financial services engineering and mining and 
chemicals among other industries 
during the heated takeover battle societe generale stock shot 
up at one point to 10000 francs a share or 286 but on 
wednesday it was trading at 4830 francs a share or 138

georgiapacific corp reported wednesday its 
earnings increased 33 percent during the first quarter of 1988 
although operating profits fell in the companys building products 
segment 
the company reported earnings of 106 million or 102 per 
share compared with 80 million or 71 cents a share for the same 
quarter last year 
sales for the quarter totaled 21 billion up from 19 billion 
in the first quarter of 1987 
the companys building products operating profits declined to 
108 million from 119 million a year ago 
chairman and chief executive officer t marshall hahn jr 
attributed the decline to the effect of bad weather on housing 
starts and a reduced demand for gypsum products 
however good demand from home improvement and industrial 
markets lessened the impact of the drop in housing starts 
net income was a record for the threemonth period and sales 
were strong throughout the quarter hahn said we are 
particularly pleased with our good performance during a season when 
activity is typically slower 
georgia pacific said it had good demand for its paper products 
during the quarter

a strong performance by its newly expanded 
pepsicola bottling operations helped ic industries inc post a 
nearly 41 percent increase in profits in the first quarter the 
diversified company said wednesday 
ic reported record firstquarter net income of 407 million or 
38 cents a share compared to 289 million or 26 cents a share 
in the same period of 1987 
the profits came on record sales of just over 1 billion 
compared to 9005 million in 1987 the chicagobased company said 
in a statement 
pet inc ics specialty foods subsidiary accounted for more 
than a third of the companys revenues for the quarter 
but pepsicola general bottlers inc a subsidiary that was 
expanded late last year through a joint venture with pepsico inc 
showed the greatest improvement sales for the division increased 
514 percent to 1864 million and operating income was up nearly 
140 percent at 224 million due to improved operating margins 
ic said 
ic also owns mufflerandbrake specialist midas international 
corp aircraft parts maker pneumo abex corp foodservice 
equipment manufacturer hussman corp and the illinois central 
railroad which it is in the process of spinning off as a separate 
company 
the results included a gain of 237 million or 22 cents a 
share from an accounting adjustment made to conform with a change 
in income tax laws that was largely offset by a 196 million loss 
at illinois central which is reported as a discontinued operation 
although the railroad had an operating profit there was a special 
pretax charge of 35 million to cover a downsizing and 
costreduction programs

jp morgan amp co reported wednesday that its firstquarter 
profit jumped 24 percent from a year ago and the chairman of the 
nations fifth largest banking company expressed cautious optimism 
about the rest of 1988 
after the difficulties of 1987 the new year has begun on a 
more optimstic note chairman lewis t preston said at the 
companys annual shareholders meeting 
for the three months ended march 31 morgan said it netted 
2814 million or 152 a share compared with earnings of 2264 
million or 122 a share the same time a year ago 
the increase reflected several factors including higher net 
interest income and corporate financerelated fees which more than 
offset an increase in noninterest operating expenses and in its 
loanloss provision 
noninterest operating income during the quarter totaled 4352 
milion up from 3368 million but noninterest expenses also rose 
sharply to 4441 million from 3711 million 
interest income increased to 142 billion from 130 billion 
while interest expenses also rose to 4382 million from 3830 
million 
morgan said that during the quarter it raised its provision to 
cover troubled loans including those from third world countries 
like brazil to 50 million from 35 million 
last spring morgan and other major banks made hefty additions 
to their loanloss reserves after brazil imposed a temporary 
moratorium on interest payments on its international debt the 
banks had hoped to safeguard themselves against possible future 
losses 
preston told shareholders that while the brazilian government 
has since resumed partial payment of interest on its debt he was 
also optimistic about current negotiations on restructuring that 
countrys debt 
we remain convinced that the developing countries debt 
problems cannot be solved by any single action or institition he 
said the situation of each country and each creditor is 
different 
the starting point for any solution is structural economic 
reform in the developing countries 
achieving significant progress in that direction has been 
mexico preston said 
earlier this year morgans principal subsidiary morgan 
guaranty trust co sponsored a debtswap program aimed at helping 
reduce that countrys 105 billion foreign debt the plan called 
for mexico to issue new 20year bonds back by us treasury 
securities in exchange for old bank debt 
the mexican loan exchange was not intended as a panacea for 
the ldc less developed country debt problem but we believe it 
was useful effort that will lead to other approaches preston 
said 
besides the third world debt crisis he said morgan and the 
banking industry faced a myriad of other problems during 1987 
including the oct 19 stock market crash that followed a sharp rise 
in interest rates 
the heartening fact is that the world financial system and 
morgan have weathered these shocks rather well preston told 
shareholders the crash itself has been much less harmful effect 
on the economy than had been commonly feared

owensillinois said wednesday it had 
completed its merger with brockway inc creating the nations 
largest glass container company 
toledobased owensillinois said integration of the companies 
operations had been under way for several weeks completion of the 
merger ended a process that began last september and has so far 
survived a challenge by the federal trade commission 
on feb 29 a subsidiary of owensillinois completed the 
acquisition of more than 98 percent of brockways shares 
outstanding for about 740 million that followed a decision by the 
government against appealing a court decision in favor of the 
merger 
each common share of brockway still outstanding will be 
converted to 60 in cash owensillinois said 
robert lanigan chairman of owensillinois has said the merger 
will make the combined operations and the glass container industry 
significantly more competitive with can plastic and other 
materials in the worldwide packaging business 
the ftc had attempted in court to block the merger saying it 
might violate antitrust laws by substantially reducing competition 
and creating the conditions for price discrimination 
however us district judge joyce hens green denied the ftcs 
request for a preliminary injunction on the basis that the agency 
had failed to prove the deal would harm competition a federal 
appeals court sided with judge green saying the ftc had failed to 
make its case 
the ftc has scheduled administrative hearings on potential 
anticompetitive effects of the merger and spokeswoman susan 
ticknor said owensillinois could be ordered to divest itself of 
brockway holdings if the agency determines that the merger violates 
antitrust laws 
brockway of jacksonville fla had sales of nearly 11 
billion last year owensillinois had sales of more than 3 billion

public service company of new hampshire 
wont flatly predict when or if its seabrook nuclear power plant 
ever will operate but the estimate it makes for financial planning 
purposes has slipped again to jan 1 1990 
that is 18 months later than public services prior written 
planning assumption though company officials told state regulators 
last year that the date had slipped at least to april 1989 
in its annual report for 1987 filed this week with the 
securities and exchange commission public service also raises the 
possibility that federal regulators would set rates if the company 
emerges successfully from bankruptcy protection and reiterates 
that rates likely would have to increase 
barred by state law from charging ratepayers for any of its 36 
percent share of the 53 billion reactor before the plant operates 
commercially and unable to borrow any more money public service 
on jan 28 became the first big investorowned utility in more than 
50 years to seek bankruptcy protection 
company spokesman nicholas ashooh emphasized on wednesday that 
the new seabrook startup assumption is not a prediction of when the 
beleaguered reactor will produce electricity 
after earlier projected startup dates repeatedly passed with 
seabrook remaining idle public service originally hoped to have 
it operating commercially in 1979 the utility in recent years has 
said it cannot predict when or if the 1150megawatt plant will 
ever surmount evacuationplanning obstacles to a license 
but in compiling its reports for the sec we just have to have 
an estimate to make some financial planning assumptions ashooh 
said 
the companys most recent previous seabrook startup assumption 
had been july 1 though utility officials had told state regulators 
during hearings on an emergency rate request last year that date 
probably would be missed 
public service was denied the seabrookrelated rate increase 
when the state supreme court upheld the law that bars utilities 
from charging ratepayers for power plants before they produce 
electricity two days later the utility new hampshires largest 
power company sought bankruptcy refuge 
public service this month appealed the state court ruling to the 
us supreme court hoping to increase the value of the company in 
reorganzation by being allowed to charge ratepayers for seabrook 
before it operates 
it is believed that some level of rate increases will be 
essential to develop and implement a successful plan the company 
told the sec 
two new england utilities have announced they are interested in 
taking over public services nonseabrook assets new england 
electric system of massachusetts has said it envisions having new 
hampshire regulators retain ratemaking authority while northeast 
utilities of connecticut has not divulged details of its takeover 
plan 
the reorganization plan could involve a sale of the company 
or certain of its assets or a splitup of the company and its 
assets into two or more companies resulting in the latter case 
in a potential change in rate regulation to the federal energy 
regulatory commission public service told the sec

the dollar rose against most of the major 
foreign currencies wednesday although most traders stayed on the 
sidelines waiting for thursdays release of us trade deficit 
figures 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
late bid of 44660 for a troy ounce of gold down from 45020 
late tuesday 
dollar traders were not making any major commitments in advance 
of the trade figures said jack barbanel a first vice president 
with gruntal amp co in new york 
the trade deficit has affected the dollars direction in recent 
months because the reagan administration has supported a lower 
dollar as a way of narrowing the gap 
a betterthanexpected figure could boost the dollar thursday 
the market was expecting the february deficit to fall within the 
range of 112 billion to 118 billion barbanel said 
traders were especially looking for signs of improvement in us 
exports barbanel said 
the foreign exchange markets also were waiting to see what would 
transpire at the meeting of finance ministers from the group of 
seven major industrial nations no announcements came out of the 
washington gathering by the time the markets closed in new york 
the ministers were discussing the dollar and other economic issues 
the dollar was down against the japanese yen in tokyo the 
dollar dipped 005 yen to a closing 12645 yen later in london 
it was quoted at 12630 yen and in new york it slipped to 12644 
yen from 126685 yen 
barbanel attributed the dollars slippage against the yen to the 
ripple effects from trading between the japanese currency and the 
british pound 
one british pound cost 18445 in london cheaper for buyers 
than late tuesdays 18515 in later new york trading sterling 
slipped to 183755 from 18468 
other late dollar rates in new york wednesday compared with 
late tuesdays prices included 16950 west german marks up from

tuesdays rates included 16895 west german marks up from

exchange in new york where it had closed at 45090 on tuesday 
in earlier london trading bullion was sold at a bid price of 
44925 a troy ounce down from late tuesdays 451 
traders said trading was lackluster in europe because most 
participants have squared their positions ahead of the release of 
the us trade figures 
in zurich golds bid price was 44950 an ounce down from 451 
late tuesday earlier in hong kong gold fell 139 to close at a 
bid 45082

oil prices were little changed wednesday but 
analysts were heartened that the market had no trouble holding at 
higher levels after an impressive twoday rally 
contract prices for unleaded gasoline posted a modest gain 
while crude and heating oils were fractionally higher 
on the new york mercantile exchange contracts for may delivery 
of west texas intermediate crude which jumped 121 a barrel in 
the last two sessions rose 2 cents to settle at 1812 a barrel 
oil prices had not traded above the 18abarrel level since 
last december 
wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 35 cent a gallon to close at 
5242 cents and heating oil rose 11 cent a gallon to close at 
4902 cents 
the market was exceptional simply because it had been expected 
to fall after the sharp twoday runup said bob baker a senior 
energy analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
reports of higher us inventories and some profit taking took 
crude below 18 a barrel in early trading but prices soon moved 
higher and held in a narrow range 
the market couldnt be depressed said richard kane a 
trader at merrill lynch energy futures theres good underlying 
support 
echoing that sentiment baker said the market showed 
surprising resilience 
analysts anticipate little change in oil prices between now and 
april 23 when a number of nonopec exporters are scheduled to meet 
to discuss coordinated strategies for reducing output and forcing 
prices up 
news that the organization of petroleum exporting countries had 
invited eight nations to participate in the meeting was a key 
factor in sparking the rally earlier in the week 
the impending meeting will keep the market in a 
sidewaystoupward momentum until we have some solid evidence on 
supply kane said 
analysts expect the market to be pelted with rumors until the 
meeting actually takes place it will be a psychological battle 
until then baker said 
reports that 100 us marines clashed with unidentified 
intruders at a military fuel tank farm in a panamanian jungle had 
no effect on trading 
in the previous session however the market advanced when the 
fatal shooting of a marine who was guarding a petroleum storage 
area on a us military base in panama sparked rumors that a 
crucial transpanama oil pipeline would shut down

international union in an effort to settle bitter labor disputes at 
four facilities 
international paper spokesman william greener said the union was 
evaluating the proposals but both sides agreed not to discuss any 
details until the plans are presented to local memberships 
wayne e glenn international president of the union said in a 
statement issued from its nashville tenn headquarters that the 
next step would be to take the proposals to the membership no time 
frame was announced

to set up a framework for pursuing the companys labor problems on 
a local level

contract disputes in mobile ala 1200 workers have been locked

premium pay had been eliminated with labors approval from past 
contracts but an improved financial picture for the industry in 
the last year prompted the unions to campaign to revive the benefit

the federal government admitted wednesday that 
it might wind up paying somebody to take the great plains coal 
gassification plant in north dakota off its hands 
allen wampler assistant secretary of energy for fossil energy 
told a house subcommittee the energy department would insist on a 
fair value for the plant and a commitment by the buyer to keep it 
operating or it wouldnt sell 
but wampler declined to say whether the department would insist 
on at least a theoretical retention value for the plant a 
value that congressional investigators estimated at about 1 
billion 
were not going to sell if it doesnt make sense to do it from 
the standpoint of fair value and the assurance of continued 
operation wampler told the energy and power subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee 
rep philip sharp dind chairman of the subcommittee called 
the hearings to explore whether the administration was about to 
engage in a giveaway of the 2 billion plant that the 
department took over in 1985 when its sponsors defaulted on 16 
billion in government loans 
the plant near beulah planned in the nearpanic energy hunts of 
the late 1970s has been a technical success it produces more than 
140 million cubic feet of synthetic natural gas per day from 
lignite selling it under 25year contracts to four pipelines 
the contract price is tied to the price of heating oil recently 
the pipelines have been paying 396 per million btus of gas 
roughly 1000 cubic feet while the average wellhead price is about 
175 
the plant has been running an operational surplus of about 50 
million a year though not charging for depreciation 
in two years the contracts will change to a price just below the 
most expensive 10 percent of gas purchased by the pipelines 
the congressional general accounting office reported that net 
revenues from the project through the year 2009 using private 
forecaster assumptions on future natural gas prices had a 
theoretical value of 569 million in other words a buyer would 
pay that now in exchange for all the future net revenues 
if a private buyer is eligible for production tax credits 
granted by congress in 1980 as an incentive the governments sale 
price would have to be about 1 billion to realize a net gain of 
569 million this makes 1 billion the retention value the 
point where the government is equally well off selling the plant or 
keeping it 
to avoid jeopardizing negotiations with eight potential buyers 
the department has not stated what price it expects the 
congressional investigators said they were respecting that secrecy 
and it is therefore very important to keep in mind that we did 
not estimate the present value of the projects future cash flow to 
a private investor and that our hypothetical sale prices does not 
represent our judgment on the projects market value 
wampler said the administration philosophically favored a sale 
because there is no prevailing reason for the government to 
operate a gas plant 
asked by rep mike synar dokla whether the department would 
sell if the selling price were below theoretical value wampler 
replied i cant answer that i dont know if i would or not 
pressed then on whether he would be basically paying somebody to 
take this off your hands wampler replied with the production 
tax credits yes it would be

international business machines corp and rival 
digital equipment corp traded places in profits on wednesday as 
ibm announced a 163 percent increase in the latest quarter and 
digital reported a 08 percent decline 
ibms strong results and digitals weaker ones came as a switch 
after more than two years in which ibm was regarded as a stumbling 
giant and maynard massbased digital as its burgeoning main 
rival 
ibms stock jumped 250 a share to 11612 in consolidated new 
york stock exchange trading digital announced its results as it 
always does after the close of the market its stock had risen 75 
cents a share to 10837 
most encouraging in ibms report was that revenue rose 10 
percent in the first three months of 1988 compared to a year 
earlier the biggest revenue gain since an 184 percent rise in the 
1985 fourth quarter 
analysts said armonk nybased ibm showed strength at the two 
extremes of its product line personal computers and big mainframe 
computers that fits the pattern of the industry as a whole said 
analyst jay stevens of dean witter reynolds inc 
it looks like theres a trend as we start out the year toward 
a twotier system stevens said 
digital and other companies that earn most of their money from a 
middle tier of minicomputers are slowing down stevens said his 
comments were borne out later in the day by digitals earnings 
announcement 
ibms firstquarter earnings per share 153 slightly exceeded 
the mean analysts estimate of 147 compiled by institutional 
brokers estimate system a service of lynch jones amp ryan brokerage 
house 
digitals 233 a share was in line with forecasts that digital 
had communicated to wall street in an effort to prepare investors 
for bad news the companys stock had sunk last month after it 
lowered its forecast from 270 a share to 250 then lowered it 
again to 230 a share 
ibms earnings of 913 million were up from 785 million or 
130 a share in 1987s first quarter revenue rose to 1175 
billion from 1068 billion a year earlier 
we are pleased that customers are responding positively to our 
strengthened product line john f akers ibms chairman and 
chief executive said in a prepared statement 
digitals earnings in its third fiscal quarter ended march 26 
totaled 3051 million down from 3076 million or 229 a share a 
year earlier earnings per share improved because of a reduction in 
outstanding shares 
digitals revenue rose 172 percent to 282 billion from 241 
billion 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year digital said its 
profit rose 19 percent to 9046 million or 683 a share from 
7602 million or 569 a share a year earlier 
results at digital would have been worse if not for sharply 
lower taxes the companys income before income taxes was 4069 
million in the latest quarter down from 4602 million a year 
earlier 
kenneth h olsen digitals president issued a statement 
saying the companys order rate growth while not what we 
planned continues to outpace that of the industry and is 
particularly robust for workstation products 
digital said demand for some of its larger computers was less 
than planned because of such factors as customers evaluation of 
new products and their concern about us and overseas economic 
conditions 
ibms new personal system2 line benefited from an industrywide 
boom in personal computer buying and the 3090 mainframe line was 
helped by price cuts and performance improvements that were 
announced in the first quarter said michael geran an analyst for 
nikko securities co international inc 
growth was strongest in europe and the far east and weakest in 
the united states he said 
in spite of slow growth in recent years ibm returned in 1987 to 
its customary role as the nations most profitable company exxon 
corp which had usurped the top rank in 1986 fell back to no2 in 
a forbes magazine list of 500 companies ranked by net profit 
sales of products other than software rose 143 percent an 
encouraging rise in ibms biggest business segment software 
revenue jumped 217 percent continuing its rapid rise while 
revenue from maintenance rentals and other services fell 
things look pretty good said wendy abramowitz an analyst 
at argus research corp she said the gain in hardware sales was 
really exceptional

the french communications giant hachette sa made 
its second major venture into the us publishing market this week 
with an announcement wednesday it will buy a major magazine 
publisher for 712 million 
hachette said it had agreed to buy diamandis communications 
inc a privately held concern that publishes a dozen magazines 
including womans day car amp driver popular photography road amp 
track and stereo review 
the announcement came four days after hachette reached an 
agreement to buy grolier inc the danbury connbased book 
publisher for 450 million 
hachette which is based in paris has interests in television 
radio magazines and book publishing 
in conjunction with publications filipacchi hachette publishes 
74 magazines in 10 languages that sell 650 million copies annually 
it said the acquisition of diamandis would give the 
hachettefilipacchi organization revenue of 19 billion this year 
rivaling time inc for the title of the biggest magazine publisher 
in thw world time reported 16 billion in magazine revenue in 
1987 but has made no projection for 1988 
diamandis was formed in october when it acquired the magazine 
division of cbs inc for 650 million in cash 
the buyers in that deal included the management of the cbs 
magazine division led by the divisions president peter g 
diamandis and two merchant banking subsidiaries of prudential 
insurance company of america that financed the buyout and took a 70 
percent stake in the new firm 
since the acquisition from cbs diamandis sold seven of its 19 
original magazines raising in excess of 232 million 
the money from those sales combined with that from hachette and 
excess cash flow boosts total proceeds from the originally acquired 
properties to more than 1 billion diamandis and prudential said 
given the magnitude of the overall gain and the timeframe 
involved this has to be considered one of the most sucessful 
leveraged buyouts ever undertaken said kenneth e macwilliams 
president and chief executive of prudential capital corp one of 
the two pudential subsidiaries 
analysts said the consensus when cbs sold the magazine division 
was that it had gotten a good price they said a combination of the 
dollars decline against the french franc costcutting steps 
undertaken since the buyout and hachettes evident desire to expand 
apparently made it worth more to hachette 
hachette had talked to cbs about buying its magazine division 
for 600 million before it was sold to diamandis 
daniel filipacchi vice chairman of hachette acknowledged 
wednesday that hachette had held some discussions with cbs in 
july although nothing came of them 
we continued to watch the company and felt that it was 
becoming more and more attractive that together with the quality 
of its people decided us on the acquisition he said in the 
statement announcing the agreement 
the purchase price includes 345 million for the equity in 
diamandis communications and the retirement of 367 million in debt 
that the prudential subsidiaries arranged prudential spokesman 
scott peterson said 
peter diamandis said in a telephone interview that his company 
was not actively seeking a buyer when it was approached by hachette 
about the possibility of selling he said their talks took about a 
month 
diamandis who has signed a threeyear contract to continue at 
the company said the deal gives his organization greater financial 
resources to expand its publications overseas tailor some hachette 
foreign publications to the us market and start new magazines 
filipacchi said his company bought diamandis communications to 
expand it not sell it off in pieces he said it would be the 
nucleus for expansion of hachettes activities in the united 
states 
the hachettefilipacchi organization entered the us magazine 
market in 1985 by launching an american version of the french 
fashion magazine elle in a 5050 joint venture with murdoch 
magazines which is controlled by media figure rupert murdoch 
it also publishes premiere a movie magazine in a joint venture 
with murdoch magazines 
the purchase of diamandis communications is being undertaken 
through hachette publishing inc a subsidiary of hachettes 
magazine division 
the grolier acquisition is being made by the hachette book 
publishing division 
filipacchi said the deals were negotiated separately and said 
it was a coincidence that the deals have come so soon after one 
another

platinum futures prices fell sharply wednesday as the dollar 
gained strength ahead of thursdays report on the us trade 
deficit which many traders expected to show a lessening of the 
importexport gap 
the dollars advance against most foreign currencies also 
contributed to weakness in the other precious metals analysts said 
on other exchanges soybean and grain prices fell crude oil 
futures edged higher livestock and meat were down and stockindex 
futures retreated 
fairly heavy selling of platinum futures by foreign investors 
sparked the decline in the preciousmetals complex analysts said 
the active june gold contract cracked the psychologically important 
level of 450 a troy ounce on new yorks commodity exchange but 
buying interest then surfaced to halt the slide and held losses to 
4 to 5 
platinum plunged 1630 across the board on the new york 
mercantile exchange where the contract for delivery in july 
settled at 52280 a troy ounce 
expectations of a sharp reduction in the february trade deficit 
from januarys 124 billion added to the negative tone in precious 
metals said stephen platt an analyst in chicago for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
what traders are looking at is the dollars strength and the 
subsequent limiting of any strong investment demand by the us in 
precious metals if that does occur platt said 
working in favor of higher gold prices however was a drop in 
supplies at commodity exchange warehouses said jerry rothman an 
analyst at elders futures inc 
rothman said the comex reported warehouse stocks at 1548 troy 
ounces down from about 26 million troy ounces less than two 
months ago 
the relatively tight supplies of deliverable gold stocks 
indicates that in the longer term the price of gold should tend 
to move upwards rothman said 
gold settled 390 to 550 lower with june at 44960 a troy 
ounce silver was 75 cents to 87 cents lower with may at 6345 a 
troy ounce 
soybean futures lost as much 9 cents a bushel on the chicago 
board of trade the grain markets followed suit as traders took 
profits amid an absence of bullish news 
soybeans started the day lower and plunged near the bell 
extending for a second day a selloff that follows last weeks rally 
caused by government reports indicating potentially tight supplies 
the wheat market received some bullish news after the close when 
the agriculture department announced it had targeted india for 12 
million metric tons of subsidized us wheat 
wheat settled 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 318 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 204 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 162 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 9 cents lower with may at 675 
a bushel 
crude oil moved higher on the new york mercantile exchanage for 
the third consecutive session on rumors that the organizaiton of 
petroleum exporting countries would declare their april 25 meeting 
an emergency session said nauman barakat of smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york 
such a declaration would enable the oil ministers to take action 
to limit production a prospect that appears increasingly likely 
barakat said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 15 cents 
higher with may at 1812 a barrel heating oil was 02 cent lower 
to 11 cent higher with may at 4902 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 31 cent to 54 cent higher with may at 5242 cents a 
gallon 
live cattle futures settled sharply lower on the chicago 
mercantile exchange with the sentiments matched to a lesser degree 
in the feeder cattle and pork pits 
live cattle settled 117 cents lower to 50 cent higher with 
april at 7375 cents a pound feeder cattle were 47 cent lower to 
05 cent higher with april at 7965 cents per pound hogs were 37 
cent to 128 cents lower with april at 45 cents per pound frozen 
pork bellies were 137 cents lower to 10 cent higher with may at 
5165 cents per pound 
stockindex futures retreated slightly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for june delivery of the standard amp 
poors 500 index settled 45 point lower at 27210 the underlying

raytheon co one of the nations top 
government defense contractors reported wednesday that its fiscal 
firstquarter earnings rose more than 11 percent over a year ago 
for the three months ended april 3 raytheon said net income 
totaled 1133 million or 168 a share on sales of 195 
billion that compared with earnings of 1018 million or 137 a 
share on sales 175 billion last year 
raytheon credited some of the increase to a boost in profits 
from several divisions including aircraft and electronics 
the company attributed a 226 percent increase in earnings per 
share to a drop in the number of shares outstanding due to a stock 
repurchase program raytheon had 673 million shares outstanding 
during the first quarter compared with 742 shares outstanding 
during the yearago period 
raytheons wichita kanbased beech aircraft corp division was 
boosted by last years introduction of the 19seat beech 1900 
turboprop plane which is being used by several domestic and 
foreign airlines said spokesman larry mccracken 
the electronics division currently producing airtraffic 
control radars for the us and canada led the company in both 
sales and profits while the energy services division which 
produces nuclear and nonnuclear power plants was the only segment 
to report a drop in sales 
raytheon was ranked as the sixth largest defense contractor by 
the department of defense for fiscal 1987 which ended sept 30 
the lexingtonbased company was ranked seventh the previous fiscal 
year mccracken said 
the backlog of govermentfunded orders including the fiveyear 
contract for the patriot surfacetoair missile rose from 520 
billion in the first quarter of 1987 to 631 billion for the first 
quarter this year 
total orders are presently 86 billion compared to 752 
billion for the first quarter of 1987

the labor department fined a rhode island 
company 612000 wednesday for what officials described as a scheme 
to underreport job accidents and deny injured employees full 
workmens compensation benefits entitled them 
the occupational safety and health administration cited collyer 
insulated wire co of lincoln ri for 102 instances of 
willfully underreporting or misrecording workdays that 
employees lost to injuries and the medical treatments they required 
osha officials cited one instance in which a worker had to have 
the tip of his thumb amputated and another in which a worker had 
to have his index finger amputated 
while both workers were off for several days 
governmentrequired records showed them not missing any work 
according to the officials 
collyer a subsidiary of the santa monica califbased wickes 
cos employs about 340 workers at the lincoln plant 
officials at the plant referred questions to the parent company 
its spokeswoman susan williams said wickes officials would have 
no comment on the osha charges until after they have studied the 
agencys complaint 
under the law the company has 15 days to either pay the fine or 
contest it before a threejudge review panel 
osha investigators said there were dozens of cases at the 
lincoln plant in which workers who were off because of injuries 
were told to punch in for their shifts and then return home 
the company called this light duty but in fact these 
represented lost workdays which the company did not report said 
terry mikelson a spokesman for the agency in some cases injured 
employees may have collected less in pay and benefits than they 
would have under workers compensation 
deputy assistant labor secretary frank white said the socalled 
lightduty program effectively masked serious injuries and the 
number of lost workays 
it is lost workdays that osha state agencies and insurance 
companies measure in determining whether to inspect a plant and in 
calculating the premiums it has to pay for workers compensation 
insurance 
it was clear to us that collyers approach was deliberately 
misleading to osha and posssibly to others said george salem 
the labor departments solicitor one incentive for companies to 
underreport is to keep their workmens compensation insurance 
rates low

westinghouse electric corp on wednesday said 
improvements in its financial services commercial and industries 
divisions helped lift its firstquarter profit by 138 percent from 
a year ago 
the company said it earned 1685 million or 116 per share 
in the first three months of the year compared with 1481 million 
or 103 per share a year earlier

have been slightly less than 138 percent without the accounting 
changes 
operating profits improved significantly in the financial 
services commercial and industries divisions and also improved in 
electronics and broadcasting but operating profits fell 
significantly in energy and utility systems compared to a strong 
1987 first quarter

top finance officials of seven nations announced wednesday they 
would keep working to stabilize the value of the dollar extending 
an agreement reached last december 
in domestic economic news the commerce department said retail 
sales rose 08 percent in march and automakers said sales of 
domestic cars and light trucks fell 108 percent in early april 
compared to a year earlier 
stock prices retreated slightly as the dow jones industrial 
average fell 298 points to 210710 it was the first dow decline 
after gains of more than 129 points in six sessions 
the finance officials meeting in washington announced they 
would use gold and other commodities as a way of measuring 
inflation pressures a concept long advocated by treasury secretary 
james a baker iii 
however their announcement fell far short of suggesting a 
return to a gold standard for currency values 
the group consists of finance ministers and central bank leaders 
from the united states japan west germany britain france 
canada and italy 
the finance ministers were critical of the newly industrialized 
nations of south korea taiwan singapore and hong kong for not 
doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances 
the meeting was the first facetoface encounter the top finance 
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last 
october a selloff thaty may have been triggered partly by 
squabbling among the top economic powers 
the drop in auto sales came after three months of unexpectedly 
strong results 
its the weakest period in a long time but i think its 
just a hiccup said david healy industry analyst with drexel 
burnham lambert in new york 
retail sales were helped by easter buying at department and food 
stores 
the commerce department said retail sales for the month 
increased by a seasonally adjusted 11 billion to 1307 billion 
it was the fifth consecutive monthly increase and the largest 
since december when sales shot up 11 percent revised figures 
showed sales rose 06 percent in february and 01 percent in 
january 
ever since the october stock market crash economists have 
watched retail sales closely for signs that the consumer sector of 
the economy would weaken but more recently some analysts have 
raised fears that too much consumer demand could rekindle inflation 
the dollar rose against most of the major foreign currencies 
wednesday although most traders stayed on the sidelines waiting 
for thursdays release of us trade deficit figures 
gold prices fell republic national bank of new york quoted a 
late bid of 44660 for a troy ounce of gold down from 45020 
late tuesday 
a betterthanexpected figure could boost the dollar thursday 
the market was expecting the february deficit to fall within the 
range of 112 billion to 118 billion 
the dollar ended the day down to 12644 japanese yen in new york 
compared to 126685 yen late tuesday

bond prices overcame some early weakness to 
finish with small gains wednesday as traders looked toward an 
impending report on the nations trade balance 
the treasurys 30year bond rose point or 125 per 1000 in 
face amount as its yield slipped to 873 percent from 875 percent 
late tuesday 
maury harris chief economist for the investment firm 
painewebber inc said trading was limited mostly to professional 
speculators rather than investors and was relatively light 
he said some traders were reluctant to take a large position in 
advance of thursdays announcement of us trade deficit figures 
for february 
the prices of some longterm treasury issues initially declined 
as much as 5 for every 1000 in face value after the government 
reported an 08 percent rise in retail sales in march somewhat 
higher than many analysts had expected 
the report depressed bond prices because it suggested the 
economy may be continuing to grow at a vigorous pace raising 
concerns that inflation and interest rates could be headed higher 
to the detriment of bond prices 
but bond prices bounced back later in the day as commodity 
prices continued to fall indicating that inflation may pose no 
imminent threat 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
issues rose 232 point intermediates edged up 332 point and 
20year governments rose 732 points according to the financial 
information service telerate inc 
the merrill lynch daily treasury index which measures price 
movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities of a 
year or longer rose 013 to 11176 the shearson lehman composite 
index which makes a similar measurement rose 127 to 116903 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years 
or longer rose 065 to to 28240 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell 8 basis points to 583 
percent a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point 
sixmonth bills fell 4 basis points to 604 percent and oneyear 
bills fell 4 basis points to 641 percent

philadelphia electric co stockholders on 
wednesday overwhelmingly rejected a dissident move to cancel the 
utilitys costly limerick ii nuclear power plant as protesters 
demonstrated outside on stilts 
limerick i located on the schuylkill river 20 miles northwest 
of philadelphia has been operating for nearly two years and its 
controversial twin tower is 85 percent complete 
stockholders defeated the limerick resolution with 88 percent 
voting against it and 12 percent in favor 
about 500 stockholders of more than 295000 who own shares 
attended the annual meeting where about 30 people many walking on 
stilts and with animal masks on their heads demonstrated outside 
protesters carried signs that read stop limerick nuke power 
we all lose and just say no to nukes 
protesters also criticized pecos peach bottom nuclear plant on 
the susquehanna river near york pa which the nuclear regulatory 
commission temporarily closed a year ago after controlroom workers 
were found sleeping on the job 
both plants have been costly to peco with the peach bottom 
shutdown costing the company 5 million a month and limerick ii 
having 1 billion in cost overruns 
corbin a mcneill jr pecos executive vice presidentnuclear 
told stockholders the utility hopes to reopen peach bottom before 
the end of this year and load nuclear fuel into the limerick ii 
reactor by august 1989 
j andy smith iii director of the american baptist churchs 
national ministries investment program for the ninth consecutive 
year introduced a resolution aimed at cancelling limerick 
we are following the guidance of the policy of the general 
board of american baptist churches that utilities place a hold on 
nuclear plants until they can be safely constructed and operated 
and the waste permanently disposed he said 
citing peach bottoms management problems smith said he had 
serious doubts about the ability of peco to operate any nuclear 
plant

editors from some of the nations leading 
newspapers on wednesday debated the best way to get more women into 
management positions with recommendations ranging from promoting 
women over more qualified men to simply giving women 
importantsounding titles 
benjamin bradlee executive editor of the washington post 
generated lively discussion when he made a wry suggestion that 
newspapers could include women in their mastheads the list of top 
management people usually run on editorial pages even if the 
women dont make key decisions 
the creative use of mastheads is a wellknown solution to 
personnel problems he said 
to that boston globe columnist ellen goodman responded ben 
youve just devalued the prize 
and marlene sanders an author and host of a pbs television 
show currents said expanding the masthead is phony 
solution people know who has the power 
the discussion opened a series of panels and seminars scheduled 
during the threeday annual convention of the american society of 
newspaper editors which featured a luncheon address by president 
reagan an estimated 685 editors are attending the convention 
minority hiring also was a topic arnold rosenfeld editor of 
the austin texas americanstatesman delivered an asne report 
that showed a slow growth in the past year in the number of black 
hispanic asian and american indian on newspaper staffs 
the rate went from 656 percent last year to 702 percent 
rosenfeld said obviously much needs to be done he said 
linda grist cunningham editor of the trenton nj times 
reported on a survey of journalists that found the people who 
gather and process the news today are predominantly white and male 
but women and minorities are gaining in numbers 
nearly everybody is collegeeducated and most are under 36 
years old there is considerable mobility in and out of 
newspapering and from one newspaper to another the prevailing 
outlook is liberal pay remains an issue she said 
of special interest to the editors she said was the finding 
that staff members give us dismal ratings for management skills 
eightyfive percent of our staff say our weaknesses lie in our 
inability to work with people our failure to encourage them and 
provide helpful feedback and our weakness in making assignments and 
decisions 
but the panel discussion of women in the newsroom called if 
women are doing so well where are they on your masthead 
attracted the most attention from editors attending the convention 
early in the discussion moderator charles ogletree a harvard 
university law professor asked the panel whether they would 
promote a woman into a top management position if that post had 
just been vacated by the only woman in a command post 
philadelphia inquirer executive editor eugene roberts said he 
would put another woman in the job charlotte observer editor 
richard oppel agreed 
i dont like designating a womans seat oppel said but i 
would not step back from appointing a woman thats affirmative 
action sometimes you need a push 
ogletree then asked if the editors would consider promoting a 
woman over three more qualified men 
oppel said he still would promote the woman because i want to 
see women filling management jobs 
but bob herbert a member of the editorial board and a columnist 
for the new york daily news said youre not going to address 
the situation by appointing one black or one woman 
kay mills author of a place in the news from the womens 
pages to the front page agreed that newspaper management has to 
make a fullscale commitment to hiring and promoting women and 
minorities 
people tend to hire people like themselves mills said 
its a clone factor affirmative action at least reduces that 
clone factor but its a commitment at the top that brings 
change she said 
bradlee suggested one way a manager could show his commitment to 
hiring women and minorities is make sure that for every vacancy 
you get a list of women and minorities interviewed for the job 
claude sitton editorial director of the raleigh nc news amp 
observer and times said another way to demonstrate the commitment 
is that you spot a promising woman reporter and send her to 
management training sessions to help her along 
in the afternoon discussion centered on the news media and 
coverage of changes in cities in the two decades since a national 
commission on civil disorders known as the kerner commission 
warned that america is moving toward two societies one black 
one white 
former new york mayor john lindsay who was vice chairman of the 
commission said blacks and other minorities have made major 
strides in the intervening years but said there are still miles 
to go 
lindsay criticized the reagan administation for doing nothing to 
erase the economic differences between blacks we probably have a 
worse problem now in relations between whites and blacks 
philadelphia mayor w wilson goode said newspapers do a better 
job now in reporting the plight of the poor but added that 
newspapers often fall short in explaining the rise in black 
political power in cities and in putting urban problems into a 
national context

top finance officials of the worlds seven 
major industrial powers putting on a show of unity to reassure 
financial markets agreed wednesday to continue efforts to 
stabilize the value of the dollar 
the group consisting of finance ministers and central bank 
leaders from the united states japan west germany britain 
france canada and italy issued a statement announcing the 
extension of a dec 22 agreement that has so far successfully 
halted the greenbacks threeyear decline 
the twopage joint communique followed a full day of private 
meetings hosted by treasury secretary james a baker iii and 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
the statement also announced the adoption of an innovative 
suggestion made by baker last september to use gold and other 
commodities as a way of measuring inflation pressures 
in addition the finance ministers were critical of the newly 
industrialized nations of south korea taiwan singapore and hong 
kong for not doing enough to reduce global trade imbalances 
the meeting was the first facetoface encounter the top finance 
leaders have had since the global crash of stock markets last 
october a selloff triggered partly by squabbling among the top 
economic powers 
mindful of investors continued uneasiness at any signs of 
disunity the finance leaders went out of their way in their joint 
statement to emphasize their strong desire to cooperate with each 
other in keeping the global economy from toppling into a recession 
the statement reaffirmed a dec 22 agreement that had been 
issued after longdistance discussions in which the seven countries 
pledged to work together to keep the dollar from falling further 
against major currencies 
the statement said the nations expressed their determination 
to continue to coordinate economic policies to strengthen 
underlying fundamentals 
the general feeling is that the economies of the various 
countries are performing well canadian finance minister michael 
wilson said at the conclusion of the session 
the upbeat tone in the view of most analysts is justified 
growth is higher this year than had been expected and the threat of 
a global recession caused by the market crash has receded 
while the united states is still running a large trade deficit 
the imbalance has been slowly improving in recent months 
the seven nations adopted an american proposal to urge taiwan 
south korea singapore and hong kong to accept greater 
responsibility in correcting large trade imbalances by making 
further efforts to reduce trade barriers and to allow their 
currencies to appreciate more 
all four countries had large trade surpluses with the united 
states last year accounting for almost onefourth of this nations 
record 171 billion trade deficit 
the statement also said the seven nations had agreed to develop 
a commodity price index as an additional economic barometer the 
countries will use to help them to coordinate policy goals 
the statement set no deadline for when the index would first be 
used there were also not details provided of what commodities 
would be included 
at the groups last meeting in september baker had caught other 
finance ministers by surprise when he first suggested the use of 
gold and other commodities as a signal of the presence or absence 
of inflationary pressures 
baker has stressed that the proposal is not a first step back 
toward a gold standard the system by which currencies were 
stabilized for a quartercentury following world war ii 
french finance minister edouard balladur briefing reporters 
after the meeting said that the commodities to be included in the 
index were still to be decided while no timetable was set for 
completion of the study balladur said he expected bakers proposal 
would be reviewed again in midjune at the economic summit in 
toronto 
the joint statement was generally in line with what economists 
and financial investors had been expecting 
i think they realize that if anything would be 
counterproductive at the current time it would be renewed 
squabbling said cynthia latta an economist with data resources 
inc of lexington mass 
the dollar has risen in recent days on currency markets in 
anticipation of the unity statement analysts cautioned however 
that those gains could be quickly lost if a report to be issued 
thursday shows that the us trade deficit for february was 
unexpectedly large 
the administration and its allies launched in effort in 
september 1985 to push the dollar lower as a way of reducing 
americas trade deficits and heading off protectionist moves in 
congress 
the administration publicly renounced further efforts to weaken 
the dollar in february 1987 in an agreement with its allies known 
as the louvre accord in that agreement the major economies 
pledged to work to support the dollars value at thencurrent 
levels 
despite that pact the dollar continued falling for much of 
1987 pushed down by financial markets which feared that steadily 
worsening monthly trade figures would force the administration to 
work for a weaker dollar despite public assurances to the contrary 
the falling dollar raised fears in the united states about 
renewed inflation and prompted the federal reserve last september 
to hike interest rates 
after the oct 19 stock market plunge raised fears of a possible 
global recession the economic powers issued the dec 22 pledge 
reaffirming their commitment to stabilize the dollar they backed 
up that pledge with massive intervention in currency markets the 
process by which countries buy a weak currency such as the dollar 
to prop up its value 
the meetings of the seven top industrial countries were taking 
place during sessions of the 151nation internatinal monetary fund 
and world bank

the senate wednesday night voted 
overwhelmingly to expand its budget for the war on drugs even 
though that would bust the spending limits in last falls 
deficitreduction agreement with president reagan 
a pair of antidrug amendments were approved after the senate 
kicked aside two days of arguments about truthinbudgeting that 
had been dominating debate on its 11 trillion blueprint for 
fiscal 1989 leaders said a final vote on the budget would be 
thursday 
the senate first approved 7618 an amendment calling for cutting 
government travel accounts by 125 million to finance new federal 
prisons and drug law enforcement efforts 
it then by a vote of 930 added to the electionyear spending 
plan a 14 billion spending expansion in drug programs ranging 
from blocking imports to treating addicts 
the amendment drafted by sens dennis deconcini dariz and 
alfonse damato rny would breach the limits of last falls 
deficit reduction agreement between the president and congressional 
leaders because it would not cut spending elsewhere 
however the money could be allocated under a clause providing 
for dire emergencies certified by the president and congressional 
leaders the sponsors said the increased cost could be covered by 
increasing collection of debts owed the government and tax law 
enforcement 
as far as im concerned if you have to raise additional 
revenues and bust the cap then you do it damato said 
lawmakers pointed out that the cap was not immediately broken 
because the revenues would be put aside and not spent unless the 
president and congressional leaders certified there was an 
emergency and enabling legislation were passed 
the senate had been ensnarled since monday in a debate over 
whether surpluses in the social security system and other federal 
trust funds masked the extent of the deficit problem 
the budget claims a deficit of 136 billion in the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 but it would be about 220 billion if trust fund 
earnings werent counted 
senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles dfla proposed 
that the senate go on record opposed to counting against the 
deficit the social security surpluses being built up now to be 
spent for future retirees 
other senators then loaded on amendments covering trust funds 
for aviation roadbuilding the postal service military 
retirement and the banking system 
after the accounting issue threatened to put the senate into a 
stall sen pete v domenici rnm won a substitute amendment 
it referred the issue to the new national economic commission 
which will be examining deficit issues over the next year 
last falls budget agreement set overall spending levels for the 
military foreign aid and domestic agencies 
in meeting those caps outside of the new drug spending the 
senate plan cut spending on some subsidies and for development and 
transportation however it also included big increases in spending 
in selected areas those include 
a 27 percent increase in the space program 11 percent more for 
national science foundation research aid and money to start work 
on the proposed superconducting super collider nuclear physics 
project 
a 19 percent boost for aviation safety including hiring more 
air traffic controllers and modernizing equipment 
an increase of 74 percent for education programs 
the pentagon under the budget agreement would spend 294 
billion and 161 billion would be spent on foreign aid 
there were no tax increases included beyond the 14 billion 
enacted last december under the agreement 
the senate and house must agree on a single budget resolution 
before it becomes final the budget which does not require the 
presidents signature becomes congress internal guideline for its 
fiscal legislation 
although this years budget resolutions are similar because of 
the deficit agreement the house and senate disagree on some 
priorities 
the house plan would provide more money for development programs 
and less for the space program the house also voted for a 3 
percent pay raise for all federal employees while the senate 
adopted reagans proposal to give the military 43 percent and 
civilian workers 2 percent

frank a lorenzo chairman of texas air corp 
often has said one of his major goals was to solve problems 
connected with consolidating several airlines and winning back 
disaffected customers 
his task took on new dimensions after the transportation 
departments announcement wednesday that it was investigating texas 
airs finances and management to determine whether the troubled 
airline was fit to carry commercial traffic 
lorenzo was traveling wednesday and was not available to be 
interviewed by reporters said texas air spokesman bruce hicks 
lorenzo 47 spent more than a decade building texas air corp 
into one of worlds largest and most aggressive airline companies 
acquiring such carriers as continental airlines eastern airlines 
new york air frontier airlines people express and smaller 
commuter airlines 
texas airs airlines now serve nearly onefifth of the us 
commercial airline market 
but along the way came major problems with coordinating computer 
systems flight schedules work forces often bitter 
unionmanagement relations and customer defection to other carriers 
texas air has said problems in consolidating several airlines 
were unavoidable and that by acquiring other carriers in many 
cases it was helping them stay in business 
after a bitter takeover battle in 1981 lorenzo merged 
continental with his smaller regional carrier called texas 
international airlines but by mid1983 the new carrier was losing 
money heavily lorenzo took continental to bankruptcy court later 
emerging with a nonunion airline 
but the losses continued with texas air sustaining a company 
record loss of 466 million last year 
in an interview aired last week on abcs 2020 lorenzo said he 
hoped to create the airline of the future 
our mission today is to put together and continue the process 
of smoothing out what has been put together and to bring to the 
consumer what the consumer demands and create the airline for the 
1990s lorenzo said 
i can tell you that in my 16 years in this business safety 
has never taken second place he said 
lorenzo studied economics at columbia college and received a 
masters degree in finance from harvard business school in 1963 he 
joined trans world airlines as a financial analyst in 1963 but left 
two years later to become manager of easterns financial analysis 
department in 1966 he and robert j carney a harvard classmate 
formed a financial advisory firm 
three years later the two men founded jet capital corp which 
bought a controlling interest in texas international in august 
1972 with lorenzo becoming the carriers youngest president ever 
at age 32 
in 1981 texas international bought continental for 100 
million with the resulting carrier keeping the continental name 
continental is now part of texas air whose principal shareholder 
is jet capital

profit in the first quarter of 1988 compared with a loss during the 
same period a year earlier the company reported wednesday 
caterpillar the worlds largest manufacturer of earthmoving 
equipment lost 84 million in first quarter 1987 
sales rose 42 percent to 235 billion in the first quarter from 
165 billion in the same period last year 
the januarymarch results gave caterpillar four consecutive 
profitable quarters the surging company is rebounding from a 1981 
market collapse which led to three years of record losses totaling 
950 million 
len kuchan caterpillar treasurer attributed the companys 
performance to higherthanexpected sales due to high demand for 
its expanded product line he said profits were curbed somewhat by 
the new 1988 tax laws and shortages of certain popular models 
caterpillar sales in the united states rose 38 percent to 118 
billion during the quarter while foreign sales jumped 47 percent 
to 117 billion 
sales fell in south america because of declining demand in 
brazil and argentina but sharply higher sales in japan and the far 
east as well as gains in canada and europe 
the company suffered in the early 1980s due to a general 
overcapacity in the industry and fierce competition at home and 
abroad where it was hampered by the strong us dollar 
caterpillar has plowed its way back to financial health through 
a costcutting program that included plant closings and widespread 
layoffs

billionaire real estate developer harry helmsley 
and his wife leona the selfdescribed hotel queen have been 
indicted on federal and state income tax evasion charges a law 
enforcement source said wednesday 
they were indicted several days ago according to the 
source who added that federal and state prosecutors are just 
waiting for a convenient time to hold a joint press conference 
the helmsleys lawyer stephen kaufman denied the couple ever 
evaded taxes and said any such charge was unfounded unfair and 
unjust 
the helmsleys have paid more taxes to the government over the 
years than practically any other individual in this city or 
country kaufman said in a twopage statement in the last five 
years alone they have paid more than 250 million in taxes 
the offices of the state attorney general and us attorney 
refused comment 
the ailing helmsley 80 and his wife are accused of disguising 
millions of dollars in renovation costs on their connecticut 
mansion as business expenses according to the source who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
the renovation bills on the sprawling greenwich estate were 
allegedly written off as tax deductions the source said 
the source said the expected charges were income tax evasion and 
falsifying business records 
us attorney rudolph giuliani and state attorney general robert 
abrams mounted a joint investigation into the helmsleys taxes 18 
months ago 
mrs helmsley 68 who is prominent in ads for the familys 
string of hotels recently turned down a deal from prosecutors who 
said they would not seek the indictment of her husband if she 
pleaded guilty to fraud the source said 
a problem for prosecutors will be the immunity mrs helmsley 
received last year in return for her testimony in cases against 
merchants of expensive luxury items including jewelry stores were 
accused of shipping empty boxes to addresses out of state so 
customers could take goods with them but avoid paying state and 
city sales taxes 
immunity received in state cases does not apply in federal 
cases even if the federal charges stem from the same acts that 
prompted the state charges according to paul shechtman chief 
counsel to manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau 
but federal prosecutors may not use leads and develop cases from 
testimony given under immunity before a state grand jury shechtman 
said 
the daily news quoting unidentified sources close to the 
defense said frank turco mrs helmsleys former top aide and 
joseph licari the couples former financial manager also were 
expected to be indicted 
the indictments followed a 15month investigation into the 
helmsleys finances by the new york post 
the daily news said the four targets of the probe were directed 
to surrender for arraignment at 815 am thursday their attorneys 
in the past have denied any illegal activity by their clients 
william broadsky turcos lawyer said his client is confident 
that when all the facts are disclosed in court he will be fully 
exonerated 
the news said as many as 30 past and current employees of the 
helmsley organization were given immunity from prosecution in 
return for testimony before state and federal grand juries
