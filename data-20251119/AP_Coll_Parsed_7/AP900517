florida congressmen said after meeting with 
president bush thursday that they were optimistic bush would bar 
new oil drilling off the south florida coast 
but sen bob graham dfla said the president made no 
commitments on the matter 
his previous statements as well as statements he made today 
were indicative of a disinclination to proceed with further 
drilling in the tract 116 off south florida graham said after 
the 13 congressmen met with bush at the white house 
the lawmakers unanimously recommended against new drilling 
republican sen connie mack said 
with respect to his attitude i dont think that anyone in this 
meeting came away with a feeling of disappointment there was a 
feeling that the president is going to be ruling in a way that 
were gong to be very happy he said 
democratic rep dante fascell was less willing to assume the 
president would decide to block exploration and drilling but said 
he too was optimistic the president will make the right 
decision 
bush is to announce perhaps as early as next week what his 
plans are for the oil lease area off southern florida and two areas 
off northern and southern california 
he held up any oilexploration activity in the three regions 
last year and named a task force to study the prospects and impacts 
of drilling 
the task force submitted its report in january but bush a 
former texas oil company executive has yet to act he met this 
week with task force members to discuss options and also has 
consulted with the california delegation 
bush indicated to the florida lawmakers he felt there was not 
enough oil in the florida waters to warrant the risk to the 
environment that oil exploration would cause said republican rep 
porter goss 
he did not seem to feel that we had a whole lot of oil out 
there to really justify all this havoc goss said 
but joe lastelic spokesman for the american petroleum 
institute said the governments 1989 estimates were that the south 
florida basin could contain as much as 106 billion barrels of oil 
unocal corp has said it could be more than 25 billion barrels 
that compares with an estimated 10 billion barrels of 
undiscovered oil off the coast of california said lastelic 
there are 42 gallons in each barrel 
bush asked the congressmen what should be done about 73 existing 
leases where activity has been held up fascell said 
the congressman said he told bush the government should 
reimburse the lease holders

a jury thursday found a 19yearold white man 
guilty of seconddegree murder in the killing of a black teenager 
in bensonhurst the most serious racial incident to polarize the 
city since the 1986 howard beach case 
joseph fama of brooklyn accused of being the triggerman in the 
killing of 16yearold yusuf hawkins faces a maximum sentence of 
25 years to life in prison 
jury forewoman tonya bailey delivered the verdict shortly after 
7 pm the decision followed 10 tensionwrought days of 
deliberations during which police lined the steps of brooklyn state 
supreme court to quell occasional scuffles 
hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of whites last 
aug 23 after they ventured into the mostly white bensonhurst 
section of brooklyn to look at a used car 
the verdict the first conviction in the case was greeted with 
shouts of glee outside the courtroom by hawkins family and 
supporters and chants of yusuf yusuf 
mayor david n dinkins in a statement said the guilty verdict 
allows us to turn our attention to the process of healing 
yusuf hawkins died of racism in the first degree that is a 
crime far more common than most of us are willing to admit the 
mayor said 
fama was found guilty on 13 of 15 counts including 
seconddegree murder by depraved indifference to human life riot 
unlawful imprisonment menacing discrimination and criminal 
possession of a weapon in the third degree 
the defendant was acquitted of seconddegree intentional murder 
the equivalent in seriousness of the depraved indifference charge 
as well as criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree 
the shooting of hawkins shocked the city and is the most serious 
racial incident since the december 1986 attack in which a gang of 
whites in howard beach queens chased a black man to his 
hitandrun death on a highway 
in the days after hawkins death racial tensions in the city 
flared as chanting protesters marched through bensonhurst clashing 
with white residents who screamed obscenities and racial slurs 
fama sat impassively beside his lawyer as the verdict was read 
several jurors wiped tears from their eyes 
moses stewart the victims father let out a quick yeah 
but then said nothing else as the other charges were read 
hawkins family and friends holding hands with their advisor 
the rev al sharpton walked silently out of the courtroom saying 
nothing then they let out a shout 
quickly they were surrounded by about 150 supporters who shouted 
yusuf yusuf at one point stewart raised a clenched fist in 
the air and smiled when someone handed him a bullhorn he joined 
in the chant for his slain son 
this is a victory for the people said dave walker an 
investigator for a brooklyn civil rights group the tensions 
high throughout the city throughout the whole country all 
communities needed the verdict 
meanwhile famas family was in a thirdfloor corridor and not 
speaking to reporters 
in bensonhurst the mood was defensive 
i feel bad for joey said john deliso 21 it wasnt a 
fair trial the judge and the media sort of practically forced the 
jury to come up with a guilty verdict 
he was a good boy ive known him 20 years said his next 
door neighbor a woman who refused to be identified they didnt 
have enough evidence nobody saw him with a gun nobody picked him 
out of a lineup 
bailey the jury forewoman said she did not feel the evidence 
supported the prosecutions claim that fama was the shooter i 
personally had decided that he was the shooter but there was not 
enough evidence according to the law for me to convict him of 
that 
bailey a college professor at brooklyn technical college said 
the deliberations took so long because it was that we examined 
every single aspect of the law we had differences of opinion 
in how we interpreted the law 
the case had worried city and community leaders who feared 
increased racial strie because of the murder 
we hope that this is the last time we ever have to try one of 
these cases said prosecutor james kohler but something tells 
me that well be back here again trying another one of these cases 
until people learn how to get along with one another and stop all 
of this racial hatred 
a second jury considering charges against codefendant keith 
mondello ended its deliberations thursday without reaching a 
verdict 
david depetris famas lawyer blamed the verdict on judge 
thaddeus owens instructions to the jury which he called 
substantially onesided 
he said the prosecution theory focused on fama as the shooter 
and his defense focused on rebutting that charge but the judges 
instructions enabled the jury to convict fama for participating 
even if it found he did not fire the shot 
i think the verdict pretty clearly demonstrates that this jury 
was following the judges instructions as best as they could 
depetris said but i think it also points up that the basis for 
their conviction was that joe fama was on 69th street and nothing 
more 
the fama jury had begun deliberations at 5 pm last monday 
codefendant mondello was tried in the same courtroom 
the victim was slain on a warm evening when he and three 
friends all black went to the mostly white bensonhurst 
neighborhood of brooklyn to look at a used car 
fama fled after the shooting but surrendered a few days later 
and has been held without bail since six other young whites have 
been charged in the attack and still face trial 
a milelong demonstration march through downtown brooklyn a week 
after the shooting ended in a violent confrontation as 
bottlethrowing protesters clashed with riotequipped police 
officers on the approach to the brooklyn bridge 
prosecutors allege mondello also 19 assembled a gang of 30 or 
more of his friends from the neighborhood in south brooklyn because 
he feared 25 black and hispanic friends of a neighborhood girl 
gina feliciano were coming to beat him up 
when hawkins and his pals appeared on the street at about 920 
pm the whites apparently mistook them for outside troublemakers 
several of the batwielding whites surrounded hawkins and pinned 
the teen in a doorway prosecutors said 
fama then pulled a 32caliber automatic pistol and squeezed off 
four shots 
two of the bullets went through hawkins chest ripping apart 
his heart another bullet hit his hand the teenager tried to 
flee but collapsed bleeding on the sidewalk and died 
in his closing remarks to the jury assistant district attorney 
edward boyar stared fama straight in the face and shouted mr 
fama you are responsible for the death of yusuf hawkins you had 
the gun you pulled the trigger you are responsible 
but defense lawyer david depetris methodically went through what 
he called uncertainties and contradictions in the prosecutions 
case against his client 
yes the death of yusuf hawkins was a tragedy depetris 
said yes whoever shot and whoever the prosecution proves shot 
yusuf hawkins should be punished 
he argued prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt 
that fama was the gunman

jurors who convicted a young white man thursday 
in the bensonhurst racial slaying said prosecutors failed to prove 
their charge that the defendant was the one who shot a black 
16yearold 
but jurors said they believed joseph famas role as part of the 
white mob that attacked yusuf hawkins was enough to convict him of 
seconddegree murder by depraved indifference to human life and of 
12 of 14 other charges 
i feel that he had the choice if he knew what was going on 
to leave the area said jury forewoman tonya bailey 
to act with a mob is depraved indifference to me ive seen 
mobs and it becomes one entity as opposed to individuals said 
bailey a professor at brooklyn technical college 
i was personally convinced that he was the shooter but there 
was not enough evidence for me to convict him of that she added 
hawkins and three other friends were attacked aug 23 as they 
walked through the mostly white section of bensonhurst in brooklyn 
jurors convicted fama 19 after state justice thaddeus owens 
told them the defendant could be found guilty of seconddegree 
murder even if he only participated in the attack 
he is just as liable if he contributed to the realization of 
the plan if he helped or made it possible owens told jurors 
late wednesday 
the last holdout on the jury telephone company worker steven 
berquist told reporters he agreed to vote guilty on the murder 
count thursday morning as the panel began its 11th day of 
deliberations 
if i had any reasonable doubt i wouldnt have convicted he 
said 
although the case was one of the most racially charged in new 
york race played no role in the difficult deliberations said 
debbie cose and michele gardner two of the three black jurors on 
the 12member panel 
we put that aside in the jury room said cose a secretary 
in an accounting firm 
we were family for 11 days said gardner 
as bailey delivered her verdict just minutes after 7 pm 
several jurors wiped tears from their eyes 
the sympathy that we feel for both families made it very 
difficult said kelley freer a young bank employee her eyes 
still red from weeping

alberto fujimori the roman catholic son of 
buddhist immigrants counts on protestant evangelicals to help him 
defeat novelist mario vargas llosa an agnostic for the presidency 
of peru 
fujimoris parents immigrated to this predominantly catholic 
country from japan in 1934 he finished a close second to vargas 
llosa in a field of nine candidates april 8 and a runoff between 
them is scheduled for june 3 
vargas llosa an advocate of free markets was the favorite but 
fujimori surged late in the first campaign despite a shortage of 
advertising funds polls show the onceobscure agronomist leading 
his famous opponent less than three weeks before the runoff 
evangelical christians responding to fujimoris message of 
work thrift and honesty carried his campaign to areas the 
polltakers never penetrated 
they spread the word in revival meetings knocked on doors in 
lima slums and the violent peruvian countryside 
raul gonzalez a sociologist attributed fujimoris strong 
support in regions where leftist guerrillas are dominant to the 
grassroots work of evangelicals and the diminishing presence of the 
catholic church 
the evangelicals have been working door to door almost person 
to person he said that has been very important 
evangelical denominations have grown rapidly in peru 
sociologists say they offer moral and social discipline in a nation 
being driven to anarchy by economic crisis and the leftist 
insurgency 
about 1 million of perus 22 million people attend storefront 
protestant churches and the number has doubled in five years 
according to the churches the largest denomination is the assembly 
of god which has 1152 churches in peru 
the evangelical movement also has grown elsewhere in latin 
america efrain rios montt a retired army general and evangelist 
who led a guatemalan military government in the early 1980s is a 
leading candidate for president this year 
jaime althaus a peruvian anthropologist and newspaper 
columnist said the evangelicals reflect the conservatism of change 
90 embodying the values of work effort savings that are at the 
base of grassroots capitalism 
fujimori recruited carlos garcia a baptist preacher in 
november as a candidate for one of the two vice presidencies 
garcia later was elected president of the national evangelical 
council an organization of protestant churches ranging from 
methodists to pentacostals 
evangelicals made up about onefourth of the 200 congressional 
candidates for change 90 fujimoris party many young party 
workers belong to the movement 
change 90 won about 50 of the 240 congressional seats april 8 
but the official results have not been announced fujimori got 30 
percent of the vote for president two points less than vargas 
llosa 
the evangelicals like fujimori because he is honest and he is 
the only truly independent candidate said campaign worker 
ricardo massa a bornagain christian 
massas uncle alejandro rojas is an evangelical minister and 
general secretary of change 90 
guillermo yoshikawa a methodist minister and change 90 
congressional candidate addressed a letter to the evangelical 
public urging churchgoers to support the partys candidates 
no longer will we have to ask favors it said our 
brothers in parliament will make sure that the rights granted us in 
the constitution become a reality for all evangelicals 
catholic church officials claim change 90 supporters sent flyers 
to convents monasteries and groups of catholic mothers urging 
people to vote against vargas llosa because he is an agnostic 
cardinal augusto vargas alzamora has said the church would not 
endorse a presidential candidate but the apostolic league of st 
pius x a conservative roman catholic group declared in its 
monthly newsletter 
if the evangelicals come to power sooner or later peru will 
become protestant no more masses no more processions no more 
saints 
fujimori says attempts to portray change 90 as a disguised 
religious crusade are unfounded 
im not preoccupied by religion and i dont discriminate on 
grounds of religion he said but added in an obvious reference 
to his opponent i believe catholic people would prefer a 
catholic president

americans in the philippines long 
accustomed to deferential treatment in the country the united 
states once ruled still live the good life here but safety is a 
growing concern 
ordinary americans often live in opulence undreamed of by poorer 
filipinos many have homes in in plush residential districts 
guarded by private security firms away from the noise pollution 
and rundown conditions of even middleclass manila neighborhoods 
but in the past two weeks three us enlisted men have been 
slain by suspected communist rebels bringing to eight the number 
of americans slain in politically motivated attacks since april 
1989 
there is no widespread panic in the 140000member american 
community but there is a sense of unease 
everyone is aware of the threat said mark blacker 
president of the american chamber of commerce in the philippines 
we all live with a little bit of apprehension 
concern is greatest among american diplomats and military 
personnel believed to be the rebels primary targets senior 
diplomats now drive in cars without diplomatic license plates and 
vary their routes to work armed guards screen visitors at their 
homes 
we used to drive up to clark air base every week to shop in 
the commissary said the wife of one american diplomat who spoke 
on condition her name not be published but no more people think 
the area around the bases is just too risky 
it was near clark that two young airmen were slain sunday 
the us militarys far east network airs frequent security 
warnings including advice against wearing uniforms off base 
children of officers assigned to the joint us military 
assistance group are forbidden from giving their home addresses and 
telephone numbers even to the staff of schools they attend 
security concerns of americans were heightened by decembers 
bloody attempt to topple the government of president corazon 
aquino the coup bid was crushed with the help of us jets 
but fears were fueled by persistent rumors of a fresh coup 
attempt and continued threats from communist rebels 
we will not stop until all us bases and all american 
occupational soldiers are kicked out of our country said 
communist rebels who claimed responsibility for sundays killings 
the slayings came on the eve of usphilippine talks on the 
future of the six american military bases in the philippines 
those talks have pumped up nationalist sentiment among the 60 
million filipinos many of whom view the bases as a vestige of us 
colonial rule 
many filipinos believe the united states which ruled the 
philippines from 1898 until independence in 1946 still dominates 
their nation economically culturally and politically 
some examples of that can be seen in everyday life americans 
are addressed as sir or maam while other foreigners 
generally are not police often ignore americans minor traffic 
violations 
but such treatment does little to calm anxiety 
after sundays killings the offbase movements of 40000 
military personnel civilian defense department employees and 
dependents were restricted such warnings are becoming common 
several american families said they had curtailed the nightlife 
of their teenage children they said they planned summer vacations 
in the united states after foreign schools close in june 
the american womens club has noted a sharp decline in 
attendance at social functions because british australian and new 
zealand nationals have been advised by their embassies to stay away 
from places where americans gather 
we used to go somewhere every weekend said the wife of one 
american businessman speaking on condition of anonymity now i 
just travel between my home and the supermarket 
last march the commander of the rebel army romulo kintanar 
said the guerrillas would not target american civilians who had no 
links to the counterinsurgency 
officials acknowledge that if the rebels expanded their targets 
to civilians guaranteeing their safety would be impossible 
maj gen rodolfo biazon chief of the national capital region 
defense command pointed to the huge number of potential american 
targets 
how can we protect them all he said

southfork ranch was spared the recent 
flooding in north texas but jr ewings home on dallas hasnt 
exactly been left high and dry 
in fact recent events sound more like a soap opera than many of 
those shown this season on the tv series 
the international symbol of texas glitz and glamour as portrayed 
on the series filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
temporarily blocking the 41acre tourist operation from being sold 
at auction 
employees also say 
there have been two rounds of staff layoffs 
ranch house carpeting required replacement because pipes burst 
during a winter freeze 
two texas longhorns broke down part of a fence trying to get 
at a tourist who was irritating them by snapping photographs 
and buffie the ranch buffalo is pregnant 
its discouraging but i think well remain open said ranch 
tour guide paul smith 23 of garland 
its no secret any longer that times are tough on the ranch 
filmed as the home of the fictional jr his mother miss ellie and 
the rest of his extended family 
the ranch 25 miles north of downtown dallas is the states 
ninth mostvisited tourist attraction its fortunes seem to have 
fallen just as in real life the texas oil industrys aura of 
invincibility evaporated and its ties to the television series are 
all but cut 
even the neighbors have noticed 
jr ewing would be welcome out here if he needs to move 
joked nelda burge manager of the southfork mobile home park just 
down the road we have a jr avenue and a miss ellie lane 
owner terry v trippet did not return several phone calls made 
over two weeks by the associated press 
in august lorimar distribution producer of dallas filed a 
lawsuit to cut off sales at the ranch of any souvenirs or other 
items related to the series lorimar contends trippet didnt renew 
a licensing agreement and even wants him to remove the encircled sf 
from the front gate 
it is lorimar televisions policy never to discuss pending 
litigation said lorimar spokesman david stapf in culver city 
calif when asked the status of the lawsuit 
trippet who like jr was once an oilman bought the ranch in 
1984 for 7 million in a heavily financed transaction the ranch 
generates income from groups who rent it for private parties 
weve had a couple proms already this year smith said 
there are dinners maybe four nights a week 
although some firsttime visitors are shocked at how small the 
ranchhouse really is its amazing what a wideangle lens can 
do says smith southfork holds a special place in the hearts of 
dallas fans worldwide 
the show is broadcast in more than 100 countries and has been 
translated into more than 30 languages 
on a recent afternoon a family from malaysia a foursome from 
great britain and a swedish man toured the ranch and snapped 
pictures 
im interested to see the entire world but especially this 
said hans helgemar 40 of uppsala sweden 
his only disappointment was the absence of the man he knows as 
yayare 
that is a constant disappointment for many other visitors 
stapf the lorimar spokesman said the season that ended friday 
was the first in 13 years in which no episodes were filmed in the 
dallas area 
smith promised a group of tourists that the cast members would 
be back this summer for more filming but stapf said he does not 
know if that is so 
ms burge said many foreign tourists knock on her door asking 
for directions 
but ms burge has wearied of the series herself to be honest 
ive quit watching it she said 
the series contract with cbs has one more year the network 
hasnt said if it would renew the contract last weeks episode 
ranked 30th in the ac nielsens co ratings

with the death of puppeteer jim henson creator 
and alter ego of kermit the frog and scores of other muppet 
characters it is like a room crowded with old friends has fallen 
suddenly silent 
kermit cut a heroic figure for this age a bemused voice of 
reason in an absurd world its not easy being green kermit 
sang on the preschoolers sesame street but concluded that 
many nice things are green 
henson was tall lean bearded with an unruly mane of graying 
brown hair and a scholars slouch the loudest thing about him were 
his sports coats 
he always seemed a bit uncomfortable in front of the cameras 
exposed to this world he would patiently explain the logic of his 
where fluffy furry feathered critters had quirks and qualms like 
our own 
on sesame street kermit would interview three little pigs 
about construction techniques hed cover the cow that jumped over 
the moon as if it were a nasa space shot 
as emcee of the syndicated muppet show kermit brought 
dignity and intense frustration to the impossible task of 
mounting a variety show with dozens of muppets and one live human 
like liza minnelli or paul simon 
there was no joke too ancient no sight gag too skewed no pun 
too awful that henson and his collaborators could not dust it off 
and trot it out usually with an elegant variation for the 
muppet show 
in one inspired bit singer della reese sits in her dressing 
room surrounded by clattering shellfish dont ask why oh clam 
up she snaps in another scene muppets horrifically collide on 
a ski slope to the ambling strains of tumbling tumbleweeds 
through it all kermit would cope or try to where others would 
give up and henson even while presiding over a multimillion 
dollar muppet empire stayed with the frog 
like others of his generation hensons first exposure to 
puppets was burr tillstroms tv show kukla fran and ollie 
featuring hand puppets kukla the clown and oliver j dragon with 
their human friend fran allison 
henson saw that television and muppets were made for each other 
the little screen might turn humans into onedimensional talking 
heads but muppets literally could fill the screen with action 
top bottom and sides 
henson also took his puppets out of the traditional punch and 
judy proscenium using sophisticated materials and technology to 
create them and put them through their paces and what wonderful 
characters 
big bird a whopping yellow bird on sesame street with 
the same cares and questions about the world as any 5yearold if 
a bird that big can have questions about things maybe its ok for 
a small person to wonder as well 
cookie monster blue and shaggy with quivering crazy eyes 
could devour nonfood substances with impunity but would lapse 
into hoarsely bellowing cookie cookie cookie at the prospect 
of eating one 
miss piggy a prima donna whose blond tresses blue eyes and 
snout have graced pinup calendars famed for her shrill battle cry 
and karate blows and her notsosecret passion for kermit who of 
course wanted nothing to do with her frog meets pig frog loses

poor emily she was taken before her time may her 
sweet pigs soul rest in peace 
the 680pound swine was led down the garden path and out to 
slaughter the victim of mans brutish ways 
they just sent her off to market without a faretheewell 
said karin stoll who raised the 4weekold piglet to fullgrown in 
the marthas vineyard town of west tisbury only to see her end up 
in the hands of jimmy dean sausage makers 
she had no business dying that way the bereaved petowner 
said in a telephone interview wednesday 
stoll a longtime resident of marthas vineyard shared her sad 
story with friends and neighbors on the summer resort island in an 
obituary for emily published in the vineyard gazette 
two weeks ago about 15 mourners held a vegetarian pignic in 
memory of emily who met her maker after a change of hands at the 
farm where she was boarded until last month 
everywhere i go people give condolences stoll said 
emily was a wellloved fixture known to many as stolls pride 
and joy but for 10 cents a pound the man who took her to auction 
chose to overlook who she was 
she was a good pig a gentle pig emily liked strawberries 
leftovers from fat tonys restaurant rolling around on her tummy 
and grunting along to favorite songs 
but for all her talents in the end emily was just a pig like 
any other in the eyes of her new caretaker he telephoned out of 
state to ask the old farm owner who said the pig belongs to 
the farm do what you want and he did wrote stoll 
the farm manager hired a man to haul emily to auction in 
seekonk where she was eventually sold to jimmy dean the sausage 
company owned by the country and western singer 
it stinks said stoll who has taken some solace from her 
two cats and two dogs she never thought things would end this way 
when emily grew to 400 pounds too big for stolls back yard 
her first adoptive home was with steve morgan who boarded emily 
with his pig helen i arranged to pay for the corn and steve 
took on the slop detail wrote stoll emily became a social 
sow as people went out of their way to visit the girls and of 
course to feed them 
but those golden days came all too quickly to an end steve 
morgan moved away and stoll found the pig a new farm the last home 
she would know 
life seemed sweet for em stoll remembered until i 
found her gate open and her pen empty 
stoll said she didnt believe the farm manager and others 
implicated in emilys death acted out of malice it was something 
worse she said 
after much investigation the culprits seem to be apathy 
greed and ultimately cruelty wrote stoll who did not identify 
the owners 
how could such a thing happen especially in this wonderful 
safe place we call marthas vineyard

the police force is not called the 
sandinista police anymore but who really controls them is far from 
certain something made glaringly clear tuesday and wednesday in 
the strike of government workers 
in other countries strikers and police often fight with tear 
gas rocks firebombs and nightsticks but practically nowhere is 
the police force still so closely identified with a political party 
that became the opposition only three weeks ago 
its the same people said joaquin morales a 
40yearold construction worker at managua city hall different 
name but still the same 
supporters of the new government of president violeta barrios de 
chamorro see the police as a sandinista force sandinistas cant 
understand why the police obey a government they consider a class 
enemy 
at the height of a standoff between the government and striking 
workers sandinista labor leader lucio jimenez said he didnt worry 
about police force breaking up the walkouts 
we are going to give a fraternal embrace to police he told 
reporters 
police are stationed in front of government buildings and 
facilities taken over by prosandinista workers 
at the telephone company striking workers took food and ice 
water to police officers outside the main building 
officers took naps under trees sitting next to strikers who 
left the main building for a cooler spot 
at the foreign ministry the only site of violence police made 
what looked like a halfhearted attempt on tuesday at pushing 
through a human barricade blocking the main gate 
when a mob rushed the foreign minister and a dozen diplomats 
standing across the ministry parking lot only three police 
officers stood guard outside the gates of a restaurant the 
officials ducked inside in a hurry 
people in the mob yelled at the officers what are you doing 
guarding them you should be protecting us you should be on our 
side 
the chamorro government wants to appear in control of the police 
la prensa mrs chamorros family newspaper on tuesday night 
published glowing accounts of the police action at the foreign 
ministry calling its behavior diplomatic and running a 
headline saying police obey order from minister hurtado 
carlos hurtado took over from commander of the revolution tomas 
borge whose interior ministry was renamed government ministry when 
mrs chamorro assumed power the ministry includes the police 
immigration and other public order departments 
it was borges pride a force commanded by sandinista militants 
where paramilitary discipline was as important as party discipline 
but the police situation remains such that when negotiations to 
end the strike began tuesday night between mrs chamorro and 
sandinista labor leaders police chief rene vivas a committed 
sandinista sat in as an impartial witness

latvians who poured into the streets to 
sing their traditional anthem when their leaders declared 
independence are doing more listening these days 
strollers in riga the capital clutch small transistor radios 
pressed closely to one ear people at bus stops hold out radios so 
others can hear 
the attraction is not a sporting event or a concert of latvias 
beloved folk songs 
latvians now have their ears pricked to the internal politics of 
independence they are riveted to the live debate in the republics 
parliament as it forms a new government 
wednesdays session was not highly dramatic it included for 
instance the confirmation hearing for the next state arbitrator 
latvians listened nevertheless 
everyone is interested of late when such crucial questions 
are being considered said indra grube a teacher who is also a 
member of a private dance group 
people are devoting some of their free time to politics 
especially nowadays she said 
miss grube dressed in a traditional white folkdancing costume 
and gold headband spoke in a small central park where riga 
television was taping performers in preparation for the annual 
summer songanddance festival 
next to the park about three dozen people were mixing the twin 
passions of song and politics joining in an impromptu chorus of a 
patriotic melody beneath a white stone obelisk topped by the statue 
of mother latvia 
someone in the crowd waved a flag of the neighboring baltic 
republic of lithuania as the group sang on the shores of the 
daugava a traditional song of latvian unity 
latvia declared the beginning of a transition to independence on 
may 4 and lithuania proclaimed outright independence on march 11 
someone in the crowd wednesday shouted why are you waving a 
lithuanian flag 
another person replied because we need solidarity 
late wednesday lithuanias parliament offered to suspend laws 
it enacted since declaring that republics independence if moscow 
agrees to negotiate an end to their tense impasse 
the site known as the freedom monument often has been compared 
to londons speakers corner where all manner of people voice 
their opinions to anyone wholl listen 
on wednesday max sikka 60 proudly displayed his estonian 
passport that predated the soviet annexation of the baltic 
republics in 1940 
others standing near the monument which was decorated with 
hundreds of lilacs carnations and tulips spoke of a hopeful mood 
in latvia 
we are not afraid of economic difficulties our shops are 
empty anyway because moscow has spoiled our economy said raitis 
jansons a member of the proindependence peoples front 
we are afraid of arms tanks and such military shows of force 
as in lithuania now he said 
asked if latvian independence would come at the cost of peace 
with the russians who live in the republic jansons said i know 
very many russians who support independence it is possible that 
there will be a good economic situation after independence and 
that will bring peace 
at the other end of rigas central lenin street stood a massive 
statue of soviet founder vladimir i lenin the statue standing 
deserted was caked with grime from the passing traffic

tourists admiring the grassy serenity of 
lafayette square little suspect that it once was the site of a 
lovetriangle murder helen hayes stage debut and a makeshift zoo 
where ulysses s grant kept a menagerie of deer and prairie dogs 
some of the secrets of lafayette square both amusing and 
tragic were disclosed wednesday during a historical tour of the 
sevenacre park opposite the white house the tour was sponsored by 
the national trust for historic preservation 
according to tour guide sarah shaffer the square that is 
inhabited today by homeless vagrants and antinuclear demonstrators 
once was surrounded by elegant hotels and clubs and the homes of 
prominent washington figures 
the square is no stranger to scandal more than a century before 
the watergate scandal engulfed the nixon white house a lurid sex 
scandal resulted in the death of the son of francis scott key who 
wrote the starspangled banner 
phillip barton key was fond of crossing the square from his 
boarding house to visit the wife of daniel sickles a new york 
congressman when she waved an allclear signal from her bedroom 
window sickles enraged at the discovery of his wifes infidelity 
killed key with a shotgun blast in 1859 
on the east side of the square lived dolley madison the 
destitute widow of james madison who had to mortgage her house 
before henry clay persuaded congress to give her 20000 to pay off 
her debt to john jacob astor 
nearby is the site of the old belasco theater a vaudeville 
palace where actress helen hayes made her first stage appearance as 
a 5yearold singer 
on the northeastern edge of the square where the department of 
veterans affairs has its headquarters stood the posh arlington 
hotel where industrialist andrew carnegie once spent 10000 on a 
dinner party for his friends 
the park originally contained a private farmhouse apple orchard 
and graveyard before it was bought in 1791 to help create the 
capital city envisioned by george washington 
it served as the unkempt front lawn of the executive mansion for 
a while until thomas jefferson ordered pennsylvania avenue built 
right through the middle it was a military campground in the war 
of 1812 and again during the civil war when president lincoln 
crossed the street to visit troops guarding the white house 
the presidents park was renamed lafayette square during the 
french military heros visit to the united states in 1824 but it 
is andrew jackson not lafayette who is honored with an 
equestrian statue in the center of the park 
the statue was cast at a local foundry from melteddown british 
cannons seized in the war of 1812 it was unveiled in 1853 and 
celebrated by spectators who toasted old hickory from open kegs 
of rum and whiskey 
the square was haunted by tragedy too 
conspirators in lincolns assassination in 1865 bungled an 
attempt to kill secretary of state william seward in his home on 
lafayette square although seward survived his wife and daughter 
died of nervous prostration shortly after the attack 
in a home on the present site of the hayadams hotel on the 
northern edge of the square clover adams daughterinlaw of john 
quincy adams committed suicide by drinking chemicals from her 
rooftop photography lab 
long before the square was beautified with fountains and floral 
gardens president grant had the park drained and landscaped 
removed a civil war cemetery and installed his pet deer and prairie 
dogs 
grants zoo was closed when the neighbors complained of the 
noise and stench 
the tour was part of local observances of national historic 
preservation week an annual event sponsored by the nonprofit 
national trust to encourage public support of efforts to preserve 
buildings objects and sites of historic significance

the overwhelming senate vote for a nearly 3 
billion bill to help states and cities cope with aids expenses will 
encourage president bush to find room for the spending in the 
federal budget a key republican backer says 
sen orrin hatch rutah said he believe white house officials 
will drop any reservations about the bills cost when they hold 
budget deliberations with congressional leaders in part because of 
the breadth of the senates 954 vote wednesday 
i think basically they wanted to see how the bill would 
ultimately sift out they now know at least from the senate 
standpoint hatch said 
were very hopeful that the white house will see the 
merits of it and will help to include it in the summit agreement 
and i have no doubt that they will he said 
hatch a leading conservative joined with liberal sen edward 
kennedy dmass in sponsoring the aids bill 
the measure now goes to the house where a similar but bigger 
version awaits floor action lobbyists for aids groups were 
optimistic about its chances there 
the senates bill would provide 600 million a year in the 1991 
and 1992 fiscal years to cities and states to deal with aids 
patients overburdening many public hospitals 
half the money would go to 13 big cities that have reported 
2000 or more cases of aids 
it would authorize spending such sums as may be necessary 
for three more years through fiscal 1995 the congressional budget 
office estimated the bill would increase federal outlays by 29 
billion over five years 
the bill was approved after three days of debate and a long 
series of amendments it was vigorously opposed by sen jesse 
helms rnc who charged money was being diverted from other 
diseases and that the bill would encourage homosexual practices 
which he termed immoral 
joining helms to vote against the bill were sens gordon 
humphrey rnh william roth rdel and malcolm wallop rwyo 
not voting was sen john heinz rpa 
the senate accepted an amendment establishing 150 new food and 
drug administration inspectors as a step to ensure the blood supply 
used by hospitals is free of the aids virus 
it also approved another amendment barring local governments 
from using any federal money provided by the bill for needle 
distribution to users of illegal drugs a stronger helms amendment 
to bar cities or states from distributing either needles or 
syringecleaning bleach was defeated 
the senate rejected 5247 another helms amendment that would 
have made it a federal crime to knowingly donate blood tainted by 
the aids virus or for intravenous drug users or prostitutes to 
give blood 
it accepted a milder version requiring that states have laws 
adequate to prosecute anyone who knowingly and intentionally 
tries to donate tainted blood 
the aids virus is transmitted through blood and other body 
fluids and homosexual contact and illegal intravenous drug use are 
primary transmitters 
the national commission on aids whose members are appointed by 
congress and the president said in a statement that it endorses 
the principles and objectives of the senates bill a spokesman 
thomas brandt said the commission similarly supported the house 
bill 
the 13 big cities are to receive half the money in the first 
year and 150 million of that in the first 60 days after 
enactment those cities and congressional estimates of their 
firstround allocation are 
atlanta 47 million boston 35 million chicago 5 million 
dallas 38 million houston 66 million los angeles 158 
million miami 68 million new york 563 million newark 
nj 77 million philadelphia 44 million san francisco 
235 million san juan puerto rico 58 million and washington 
dc 64 million 
those cities will be eligible to apply for a second round of 
150 million later in the first year of the bill 
the other half of the bills money would go to states the money 
would be used to care for aids patients and to provide 
communitybased services and support programs

the annual assembly of the world health 
organization warned there could be up to 3 million tobaccorelated 
deaths per year during the 1990s and called for a steppedup 
antismoking campaign 
the resolution adopted on wednesday without a vote suggested 
raising taxes on tobacco among proposals to discourage smoking 
it also urged concerted action to eliminate eventually all 
direct and indirect advertising promotion and sponsorship 
concerning tobacco 
member nations including the united states also were urged to 
consider measures to protect nonsmokers exposed to smoke in public 
the resolution said unless current smoking rates decrease there 
will be 3 million tobaccorelated deaths per year during the 
1990s it did not give the current rate 
an increasing number of americans have kicked the habit but 
smoking is still on the rise especially in many developing 
countries 
the resolution was initiated by new zealand and had 23 
cosponsors

the bush administration worried that 14000 
nicaraguan contras may run out of food has come up with a 
contingency plan to feed the rebels for a month us officials say 
the administration had hoped that congress would have approved 
by now a 300 million nicaragua aid proposal that includes food 
supplies for the contras and president bush complained on 
wednesday about procedural gridlock on capitol hill 
as a stopgap measure the administration is expected to take 
between 1 million and 15 million from aid programs to other 
countries in order to help feed the contras said the us 
officials who asked not to be identified 
democrats indicated wednesday that it was unlikely the aid 
requested by the administration would be passed before the end of 
next week when congress is scheduled to begin its memorial day 
recess but at a news conference bush urged lawmakers to stay 
through the holiday weekend to complete the bill 
the package also includes 420 million for panamas 
fivemonthold government bush blasted congress for piling on 
scores of domestic spending proposals that have nothing to do 
with panama and nicaragua 
one of the most controversial amendments would approve use of 
local tax dollars for abortions in the district of columbia the 
president said he would veto any bill including such a provision 
house and senate negotiators are trying to resolve differing 
versions of the bill passed by their chambers 
democrats said bush was using the aid package as a foil to 
divert attention from problems facing his administration such as 
looming budget deficits 
he should be concerned with his deficits as he is with aid 
for central america said rep david bonior dmich health care 
education taxes and budget were the pressing issues in his 
district not foreign aid bonior said 
as part of an elaborate peace plan the contras have assembled 
in five security zones that are offlimits to soldiers of the 
sandinista army of nicaragua about 30 million of the 300 million 
would be used for humanitarian aid for the contras and resettling 
them back to their home towns 
but officials of the organization of american states who are 
assisting in the resettlement process report that only a few days 
supply of food remain 
the officials declined to say which countries would be affected 
by the proposed transfer known as reprogramming in diplomatic 
jargon 
state department lawyers were attempting to determine whether it 
would be legal for the administration to give back the funds to the 
countries originally earmarked for the aid once congress approves 
the aid package 
what worries the administration is that the food problem facing 
the contras could unravel the nicaraguan peace process 
the administration has said that the contras if they are 
deprived of food might leave the security zones in search of fresh 
supplies raising the possibility that they could come in contact 
with the sandinista army 
even though political power in nicaragua has passed from the 
leftist sandinista government to usbacked president violeta 
chamorro the loyalties of the sandinista army remain uncertain 
the hostility between the sandinistas and the contras remains 
strong after 10 years of warfare and officials are worried about 
renewed armed conflict if the rebels leave the safety of the 
security zones 
bush said he has exhausted all administrative avenues for 
providing aid to nicaragua and cannot legally grant mrs chamorros 
request for an emergency 40 million loan the treasury department 
cannot make such loans without assurance nicaragua would get us 
aid or other revenues to pay it back 
democrats said conservative republicans were the villains in the 
tangled legislative web because they had rejected a compromise on 
strings attached to military aid to el salvador measure even 
though the state department was willing to negotiate 
as a result the democrats have attached the el salvador measure 
to an aid authorization bill setting the stage for a floor fight 
when the measure comes before the full house next monday 
democrats are insisting that the authorization bill be passed 
before any money flows to nicaragua and panama along with that 
measure lawmakers would have to pass an appropriations bill 
providing the actual dollars 
the el salvador proposal would condition aid to the usbacked 
government of president alfredo cristiani in an attempt to 
encourage his government and leftist rebels to negotiate peace in 
the central american country 
the measure would hold back 50 percent of the 1990 military aid 
which totals 85 million it would do the same for military aid in 
1991

tom wolfes novel the bonfire of the 
vanities includes headlinegrabbing politicians zealous 
journalists and an unyielding judge 
life imitated art on wednesday when essex county executive 
nicholas amato announced at a packed news conference that the 
county is suing new jersey chief justice robert n wilentz 
wilentz barred film crews from the county courthouse because he 
said the script for the movie version of bonfire called for a 
scene that showed blacks acting in a riotous lawless and 
lifethreatening manner 
angry over the loss of 250000 in filming fees amato sued 
the american civil liberties union joined the lawsuit 
contending that the chief justice is interfering in the 
moviemakers first amendment right of free expression 
hes violating the first amendment amato said hes also 
costing the taxpayers in essex county a lot of money and for 
what 
carl golden a spokesman for the state courts said wilentz has 
not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it 
his position hasnt changed though golden said its 
important to remember that the chief justice is not saying you 
cant make a move hes saying is he wont allow a courtroom for 
this particular scene 
warner bros has no part in the lawsuit the movie studio said 
it doesnt have the time to wait for the matter to be settled to 
complete the scene 
the suits not something thats going to make the filming of 
the movie any easier and thats what we want to do make a 
movie said warner spokesman rob harris 
the movie is based on the wolfe novel about a white wall street 
bond salesman sherman mccoy who is thrust into the new york 
citys bronx court system after he accidentally kills a black youth 
in an auto accident 
wilentz objects to a scene that shows a metal gate being slammed 
in the faces of a black mob after the charges against mccoy are 
dismissed 
what the scene depicts is rage over the outcome said 
harris the judge seemed to think that that rage could be 
conveyed through two people engaged in dialogue 
if he really thinks that i wouldnt want to see any movie he 
would direct 
the lawsuit says wilentz is unlawfully seeking to censor 
restrict and regulate the content of the movie it asks that 
wilentz be barred from prohibiting use of the courthouse and seeks

a treatment with bright lights that can ease 
wintertime depression is showing promise for nonseasonal depression 
too although why it works is a mystery a scientist says 
it may work by adjusting the timing of internal body activities 
or by replacing the sunlight missed by people who spend most of the 
day indoors said dr daniel kripke 
he discussed the topic wednesday in a news conference at the 
annual meeting of the american psychiatric association other 
speakers reported preliminary success in using light therapy for 
premenstrual syndrome and for chronic inability to fall asleep at a 
reasonable hour 
kripke of the university of california san diego and other 
researchers tested light therapy on 51 veterans who were 
hospitalized for depression 
twentyfive patients were exposed to bright white light usually 
from 8 pm to 11 pm every night for a week the 26 others 
received a placebo treatment of dim red light for those hours 
at the end of the week patients who received the experimental 
treatment showed significant lessening of depression while those 
on the placebo did not improve kripke said 
the benefit was probably better than a medication could do in a 
week he said drugs require several weeks to reach full 
effectiveness and it is not yet clear how light therapy would 
compare in a longerterm study he said 
still i think theres a real effect here said norman 
rosenthal of the national institute of mental health it will take 
more work to tell how useful light therapy could be he said but 
in treating depression you take anything you can get 
light treatment was in the news earlier this month when 
researchers announced it could help nightshift workers avoid 
daytime insomnia and onthejob sleepiness 
one study presented wednesday suggests light treatment may also 
help people whose sleep troubles are caused not by their jobs but 
by an internal abnormality 
people with delayed sleep phase syndrome are chronically 
unable to fall asleep when they want to at night which makes them 
groggy the next morning at work or school said dr jean 
josephvanderpool of the mental health institute some may stay 
awake until 5 am or so he said 
they may drink four or five cups of coffee a day to stay awake 
in the morning and may abuse medications or alcohol in their 
attempts to fall asleep sooner at night he said children with the 
disorder may be considered lazy or irresponsible by their parents 
he said 
nobody knows how common the disorder is although one study 
found it in 7 percent of a group of new york high school students 
he said 
josephvanderpool and colleagues tried light treatment in 20 
patients each was exposed daily for two weeks to bright light from 
7 am to 9 am and wore dark goggles from 4 pm to dusk 
the experimental treatment helped the subjects fall asleep about 
two hours earlier and feel more alert between 9 am and 11 am 
josephvanderpool said 
the approach is a very reasonable thing to try to do said 
sleep expert merrill mitler of the scripps clinic and research 
foundation in la jolla calif 
the basic cause of the sleep abnormality is not known for sure 
he said in a telephone interview 
in another study dr barbara perry of the university of 
california san diego said light therapy showed promise in 
relieving depressive symptoms of premenstrual disorder 
the condition can also include such symptoms as sudden mood 
shifts irritability difficulty concentrating and decreased 
interest in ones usual activities symptoms appear in the week 
before menstruation 
perhaps 5 percent of women with menstrual cycles have symptoms 
severe enough to interfere with their daily lives parry said 
in her study six patients were treated with bright light in the 
morning for two hours daily for a week during their premenstrual 
phase 
they showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms she 
said 
she cautioned that the work must be repeated to better assess 
its promise but the approach may someday replace or add to 
medications for some people with the disorder she said

vietnam veterans who suffered cancer and other 
diseases after exposure to agent orange should receive disability 
payments says a government adviser who had ordered spraying of the 
herbicide 
retired adm elmo r zumwalt jr told a department of veterans 
affairs advisory panel that he believed 27 cases of illness mostly 
cancers could be sufficiently linked to agent orange exposure to 
justify compensation 
zumwalt spoke to the environmental hazards advisory committee as 
its newest member and as a personal adviser to veterans secretary 
edward j derwinski jr 
the committee on wednesday began reviewing scientific evidence 
on the health effects of agent orange 
zumwalt speaks from a unique perspective as commander of naval 
forces in vietnam he ordered the spraying of the 
dioxincontaminated herbicide which was used to deny jungle cover 
to the enemy 
in addition zumwalts son who served in vietnam died of a 
cancer linked to agent orange exposure and a grandson has birth 
defects linked to exposure 
zumwalt urged the panel to take a fresh look at the scientific 
evidence on agent orange he also said a study he conducted for 
derwinski parallels the work of an independent group of scientists 
hired by three veterans groups 
that group the agent orange task force said this month there 
was enough evidence to justify compensation for eight diseases or 
ailments that have been linked to exposure the panel said there 
were 13 other health problems mostly cancers for which there is 
sound evidence of connection but not yet enough evidence to justify 
compensation 
i suggest to you that any objective review by knowledgeable 
experts in the field would predictably lead to much the same 
conclusion zumwalt said he contended the va panel lcked a 
systematic approach or epidemiological perspective 
zumwalt went further saying he believes 27 ailments mostly 
cancers could be compensated using va criteria that were adopted 
as the result of a court order last year 
the main diseases cited by the task force zumwalt and others 
are nonhodgkins lymphoma hodgkins disease soft tissue sarcoma 
chloracne and other skin disorders liver disorders a metabolic 
disorder known as porphyria cutanea tarda and birth defects 
zumwalts list includes 13 kinds of cancer in addition to those 
already cited 
the va has said it will come up with final rules this year on 
compensation derwinski must make the decision based on the 
recommendations of the 15member advisory committee a panel of 
scientists and lay people 
the va decided in march to award compensation for 1800 vietnam 
veterans with nonhodgkins lymphoma that decision was based on a 
centers for disease control study that found an increased risk of 
the disease among vietnam veterans as a whole the study was 
inconclusive on agent orange exposure 
about 36000 claimants have been denied compensation despite 
their contention that agent orange exposure caused their health 
problems about 240000 say they have been exposed to the herbicide 
the zumwalt statement heartened congressional vietnamera 
veterans who have pushed for legislation to award compensation 
the evidence is there said sen tom daschle dsd the 
only question left is whether or not the federal government is 
willing to accept its responsibility

a paralyzing strike by public 
employees ened wednesday night when the new government agreed to 
double workers salaries and promised not to fire those who walked 
off the job 
the agreement included a 100 percent pay raise beginning next 
month to workers belonging to sandinista unions 
the workers went on strike friday demanding a 200 percent pay 
raise and restoration of a law under the former leftist sandinista 
government that protected public employees from being fired 
the walkout virtually shut down managua and much of this central 
american nation of 35 million residents three weeks after the 
sandinistas turned over power to conservative president violeta 
barrios de chamorro on april 25 
labor minister francisco rosales read the agreement to reporters 
wednesday night other details of the accord were not immediately 
available 
earlier wednesday the beleaguered chamorro government reached 
tentative accord with sandinista labor leaders to end some of the 
crippling strikes by government employees 
but most of her 3weekold administration remained frozen by the 
walkouts and suffered a further blow when president bush said 
wednesday that legally his administration cannot provide 40 
million she sought in emergency loans 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo had described the situation as 
very difficult he met wednesday with former president daniel 
ortega 
ortega later told reporters obando agreed to his request to 
intercede with the government so negotiations do not break down 
and would also ask that talks be held between the government and 
sandinistas to discuss other issues such as demobilization of the 
rebels known as contras and agrarian reform 
obando said he agreed because we must seek a climate of 
reconciliation 
the national panorama is very tense because of the strike and 
the pot could explode if more wood is fed into the fire obando 
told reporters 
most government workers are sandinista holdovers of the ortega 
government 
bush told a news conference in washington that nicaragua is 
absolutely bankrupt and asked congress to act quickly on 
pending legislation providing 300 million in aid to the 
usbacked government 
but he said of mrs chamorros request for a loan to get her 
through the immediate financial crisis i cant provide that 
because the nicaraguans have no assured means of repayment 
in earlier talks strike leaders reduced their demand for salary 
increases from 200 to 180 percent and the government responded by 
doubling its offer to 120 percent union leaders said they accepted 
the lower 100 percent figure to do their part to fight raging 
inflation 
both sides agreed to review labor contracts and other pending 
issues and work together to reform a jobprotection civil service 
law the sandinistas enacted shortly before leaving office last 
month after nearly 11 years in power 
mrs chamorro then proposed to rehire labor leaders fired last 
week and rescind an order declaring the strike illegal 
mrs chamorro labor minister francisco rosales and their 
advisers worked out the tentative accord with leaders lucio jimenez 
and jose angel bermudez of the sandinistadominated general 
federation of state employees federation spokesman douglas diaz 
told the associated press 
nicaraguan and us government officials have accused the 
sandinistas who were defeated in feb 25 elections of trying to 
undermine the conservative chamorro administration 
until wednesday ortega and other sandinista front leaders were 
conspicuously quiet about the strike 
railroad workers on wednesday resumed supplying crude oil to 
refineries to prevent a fuel shortage but the rest of the 
administration continued to be at a virtual standstill 
managuas international airport schools and banks remained 
closed public transportation was next to nothing and thousands of 
people were stranded about 20 buses were running in the capital 
public hospitals were open but at least one limited treatment to 
the very old or young pregnant women and emergency cases 
in messaging bush on may 11 to ask for emergency aid mrs 
chamorro said my country is bankrupt and that inflation was 
running at 70 percent monthly 
administration officials said they inherited an economy ravaged 
by years of sandinista rule and us economic sanctions with only 
3 million left in the treasury and an 11 billion foreign debt 
a municipal construction worker makes about 10 a month at the 
parallel market exchange rate a secretary 70 a technician 140 
and the deputy manager of a stateowned bank 350 a month the 
parallel rate is the one most people use to buy and sell dollars 
the official rate is a preferential rate used for key imports and

a movie shows a spirited 16yearold high school 
student being raped and beaten by teenage thugs hired by the 
younger sister of her boyfriend 
why shes a korean in japan 
the victim is the heroine of yuns town directed by kim 
uson a lifelong korean resident of japan although the attack is 
fictional kim says it symbolizes the discrimination against the 
nearly 700000 koreans who live in japan 
acrimony between japan and its neighbors on the korean peninsula 
dates back centuries and scars are still visible from the 191045 
era when japan ruled korea as a colony many of the koreans who 
live in japan today are either those brought over as forced 
laborers or their descendants 
the bitterness has emerged in a series of events preceding the 
may 23 state visit of roh taswoo only the second such trip to 
japan by a south korean president 
on tuesday prime minister toshiki kaifu said he will apologize 
for japans colonial rule but some koreans want the apology to 
come from emperor akihito a demand resisted by japans governing 
party 
under japanese rule koreans were told to worship the emperors 
father the late emperor hirohito and they were forced to learn 
japanese in school some were drafted into the japanese army and 
many died during the war 
in south korea opposition parties and others have urged roh to 
stay at home 
last month under pressure from roh japan agreed to throw out a 
fingerprinting requirement for the most recent generation of 
koreans in japan but the decision affects only four infants the 
grandchildren of those who registered as residents as of 1971 
fingerprinting is just one of many measures that put ethnic 
koreans at a disadvantage in japans homogenous society 
many ethnic koreans are lifelong japanese residents but they 
cannot vote or apply for civil service jobs they face deportation 
if they commit serious crimes and find it almost impossible to 
obtain jobs as public school teachers like other foreigners in 
japan they are forced to register as aliens and cannot become 
citizens without adopting japanese names 
outside the south korean embassy in tokyo radical rightist 
groups regularly jeer koreans go home through loudspeakers 
as in the movie yuns town there are many cases of korean 
junior high and high school students being bullied 
ironically for those who see the movie as an indictment of a 
racist culture kim says he made yuns town to show a brighter 
side of the korean people 
the stereotypes about koreans in japan are that they feel 
nothing but bitterness and hatred toward japanese because they are 
objects of discrimination said the 37yearold director 
i wanted to make a movie that showed fleshandblood people 
koreans who can delight in life and communicate on an equal footing 
with japanese said kim who shot the movie in a korean ghetto in 
osaka where he was born 
while planning the 760000 movie kim went to major japanese 
studios but all refused financing 
this says as much about selfcensorship within the movie 
industry as it does about discrimination against koreans kim 
maintains 
koreans are not the only film taboos kim says films on atom 
bomb victims are also off limits to make such movies is to point 
a finger at emperor hirohito and film makers and studios fear 
this kim says 
what they fear is attacks on their theaters by radical rightists 
who revere the imperial family 
kim finally got the funds he needed from korean investors in 
japan and from a group of japanese artists and actors 
despite applause from the critics kim encountered difficulties 
in getting the movie distributed it was shown in only a dozen 
theaters 
nonetheless kim won the new directors award last year from the 
japan film directors association the first time it had ever gone 
to a nonjapanese 
the government culture agency also gave the director a 63000 
grant 
yuns town was shown at the cannes film festival in france 
last year and at several other major festivals including the 
hawaii international film festival where it was one of five 
nominees for the top award 
japanese nowadays say its an international era in japan but 
i dont think theres internationalization here at all there are 
koreans chinese filipinos living here but japanese treat us as 
if we dont exist kim says

a childrens advocacy organization says it 
will help lowincome households install safety devices on their 
sinks bathtubs and showers that will shut off the water when it 
gets hot enough to burn a small child 
the change in plumbing fixtures is urged in a program begun 
wednesday by the national safe kids campaign to help prevent 
instances that daily send 100 children to hospital emergency rooms 
nationwide for treatment of scald burns 
the coalition also said it would work to amend local plumbing 
and construction codes to include stricter regulations for fixtures 
that control water temperatures and regulate water pressure 
in less than the time it takes you to answer the telephone in 
an adjoining room a child can be suffer a serious disfiguring 
burn from tap water hot beverages or food when left unattended 
dr c everett koop safe kids chairman and former us surgeon 
general said in announcing the program 
it happens all the time every day 100 children are taken to 
emergency rooms with scald burns in this country koop said this 
year 37000 children under the age of 14 will be injured by a 
scald burn severely enough to receive emergency medical treatment 
what gives us a little red mark can give a small child a 
first or seconddegree burn said ann parsons a nurse in the 
burn unit at childrens national medical center here 
safe kids will help provide antiscald springactivated safety 
valves for plumbing fixtures in lowincome homes with children 
under five at a cost of 5 each the program will include 
installations in 200 units at washingtons highland terrace public 
housing development in washington dc lowincome residents can 
contact safe kids at 2029394993 
children from lowincome homes especially those living on the 
lower floors of public housing or multiplefamily dwellings are 
often scald burn victims because the water temperature is raised to 
extremely high levels to provide adequate hot water to upper floors 
the safety devices produced solely by connecticutbased memry 
corp operate on a spring device that automatically shuts off the 
flow of water to individual fixtures when the temperature reaches 
120 degrees fahrenheit other consumers can order the devices by 
telephone from memry at 18007827840 
the average cost for retrofitting fixtures in older homes is 13 
per sink 17 per shower and 40 per bathtub

radiation releases from nuclear plants and 
bomb tests may have contributed to the deaths of millions more 
americans than acknowledged by the government say the authors of a 
new book 
a spokeswoman for the commercial nuclear industry called the 
assertion hysterical fearmongering some independent 
scientists dismissed the book as invalid 
it just doesnt make any sense scientifically said bernard 
l cohen a professor of physics and radiation health at the 
university of pittsburgh 
benjamin a goldman and jay m gould authors of deadly 
deceit said wednesday that government mortality and radiation 
statistics showed that death rates for infants and the elderly rose 
significantly after accidental radiation releases at nuclear plants 
in south carolina connecticut and pennsylvania in the 1970s 
goldman a researcher and author and gould a statistician 
also claim that radioactive fallout from the explosion of the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant in the soviet union in april 1986 
accelerated the deaths of about 40000 americans during the summer 
of 1986 
as the basis for this claim the authors cited government 
statistics that showed a 53 percent increase in reported us 
deaths in may 1986 compared with may 1985 they said this was the 
biggest may increase in 50 years and that the odds of this being a 
chance event unrelated to chernobyl were less than one in 1000 
the book also contends that deaths related to fallout from 
aboveground nuclear tests which were banned in 1963 may be far 
in excess of any previous estimates 
the authors reached this conclusion on the basis of national 
mortality tables that showed a steady decline in death rates in the 
united states until the 1950s when the rate flattened out the 
rate resumed falling after the early 1960s 
this 10year period of little or no improvement in the death 
rate coincided with the height of the us and soviet atmospheric 
nuclear testing programs 
we have estimated that this midcentury mortality failure 
could have been measured as equivalent to 9 million excess 
deaths as the difference between the observed number and what 
would be expected on the basis of pre1950s trends gould said at 
a news conference 
the authors said they could not be entirely sure of the accuracy 
of their conclusions since they were formed on the basis of 
statistical anomalies and not scientific investigation of links 
between radiation doses and human health 
if it is not lowlevel radiation that caused this then it is 
up to the scientific community to explain what in gods name 
accounted for this gould said 
cathy roche a spokeswoman for the us council for energy 
awareness a nuclear industry trade group said the assertions by 
gould and goldman had been made previously and debunked by state 
and federal health authorities she said the authors have an 
antinuclear bias that skewed their analysis 
dr henry wagner of the division of nuclear medicine and 
radiation health sciences at johns hopkins medical institution in 
baltimore said the analysis by gould and goldman was incorrect 
because it did not account for other factors that affect mortality 
rates such as poverty 
i think the book is totally invalid wagner said

legislation guaranteeing the civil rights of 
at least 43 million disabled americans was up for house action 
today 
hailed widely as the most significant civil rights legislation 
since the 1960s the americans with disabilities act was considered 
certain to pass 
the bill handily cleared all four house committees that have 
jurisdiction over it the senate passed the measure last september 
by a 768 vote 
more recently president bush urged its quick passage although 
the administration objects to a key proposal how to punish 
employers violate the law one section of the bill could make it 
possible for employers to be sued for damages 
disabled citizens have waited long enough for equality bush 
said earlier this month 
the bill that emerged from negotiations last year with the white 
house prohibits discrimination in employment and guarantees access 
to business and professional services it requires that buses 
trains and other mass transit be made accessible to disabled 
people including those in wheelchairs telephone service also 
would have to be made available for people who are hearing or 
speechimpaired 
to soften the economic impact the bill includes a number of 
timetables and exemptions 
for example businesses with fewer than 15 employees would be 
exempt from the job protection provisions those provisions take 
effect after two years for businesses with 25 or more employees 
after four years for those with 15 to 24 workers 
modifications to accommodate disabled employees could not cause 
an undue hardship 
also adjustments to existing buildings or offices to make them 
accessible to disabled patrons or clients would have to be easily 
accomplishable without much difficulty or expense 
amendments may be introduced that are aimed at giving more 
breaks to small businesses 
other amendments could focus on the definition of disability 
which by case law includes people with infectious diseases 
including aids 
rep jim chapman dtexas wants employers in the food service 
industry to be able to reassign workers with a contagious disease 
so they wont be handling food 
such amendments would cover aids along with other diseases even 
though aids is not transmitted by such casual contact 
but rep steve bartlett rtexas said in a rules committee 
hearing tuesday restaurants would lose customers because of the 
misperceptions surrounding hiv infection 
he said the proposed amendment resolves a very practical and 
difficult question of equities

the united states and arab countries are 
suspending efforts to negotiate a united nations resolution 
criticizing israeli settlements in occupied territory as a 
violation of international law us officials say 
the arab nations were hoping to come up with a security council 
resolution that would criticize israel and not be vetoed by the 
united states but the effort was abandoned partly because the arab 
diplomats were unable to overcome differences over wording with 
us negotiators american officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said wednesday 
israel had protested the joint usarab efforts the new 
yorkbased conference of presidents of major jewish organizations 
issued a statement saying it was gratified at the outcome 
the arab countries are concerned about the increasing flow of 
soviet jewish refugees to israel and the prospect that many would 
be resettled in territory seized by israel in the 1967 war 
this would make it harder to fulfill the arab goal of 
establishing a palestinian state in those areas 
but israel has said that only a tiny fraction of the refugees 
have been resettled in the west bank or gaza strip or in east 
jerusalem 
the state department has generally sided with the arab position 
that soviet jews must not be settled in the occupied territories 
officials have said that a request for 400 million in us aid 
to house the soviet emigres would be jeopardized if soviet jews are 
resettled in these areas 
the bush administration has expressed opposition to all 
settlement activities in the territories but it has stopped short 
of saying they are illegal 
israel felt that the united states by trying to cooperate with 
the arab countries on the issue was going along with what it 
called an arab effort to block the flow of soviet jews to israel 
the settlement issue is one of several on which the united 
states and israel disagree but the administration maintains that 
it continues to view israel as a close ally

secretary of state james a baker iii received 
a religious picture worth 175 as a gift last year from soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the gift was duly noted by baker in his annual financial 
disclosure form which also noted the receipt of a hunk of the 
berlin wall picture frames photo albums pottery a handpainted 
egg a watercolor a silver letter opener and books all presents 
from foreign officials 
the picture which was not further described was presented to 
baker by shevardnadze last september as the two met at bakers 
ranch near jackson hole wyo 
the baker gift list for 1989 also includes a leather hat valued 
at 100 from gareth evans foreign minister of australia a piece 
of the berlin wall valued at 75 from walter momper mayor of west 
berlin a malachite horse valued at 150 from sir david wilson 
governor general of hong kong and a mezuzah a jewish religious 
object intended to be placed on the doorpost of ones home from 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
the financial disclosure form obtained wednesday under the 
freedom of information act shows that baker kept a promise made 
last february to sell his holdings in a new york bank and all his 
other publicly traded stock 
the move was prompted by questions from president bushs ethics 
chief about potential conflicts of interest 
announcing his decision in february 1990 baker said it went 
well beyond what was required by law or had been recommended to 
him by government lawyers 
the controversy revolved primarily around bakers holdings in 
chemical new york corp which had lent 45 billion to third world 
nations 
third world debt is an issue routinely faced by secretaries of 
state 
the disclosure form shows that on march 7 1989 baker sold 1100 
shares of chemical new york preferred stock valued for reporting 
purposes at 15000 to 50000 and thousands of other types of 
chemical corp stock valued at a range of 26000 to 75000 
baker also sold hundreds of shares of the stock of other 
companies valued in all at a range of 35000 to 120000 
the publicly traded companies included exxon corp houston 
industries inc trinity petroleum trust commonwealth edison 
property capital trust salomon inc schlumberger inc united 
technologies corp and residential resources mortgage investments 
corp 
the disclosure form shows also that on dec 15 1989 baker 
purchased 1222 shares of a merrill lynch municipal bond fund 
valued at a range of 5000 to 15000 
bakers stock holdings are in a qualified blind trust a trustee 
controls the stocks and tells baker annually of the general nature 
of the holdings 
the current financial disclosure form filed with the office of 
government ethics and the one baker filed last year both put a 
value of more than 250000 on the assets held in the secretarys 
qualified blind trust 
both forms show that the secretary received more than 100000 a 
year in income from the trust during the time covered january 
through august of 1988 and 1989 
the 1989 disclosure places the value of the ranches baker owns 
in texas and wyoming at more than 250000 each

who received an invitation to a 1500aplate political dinner 
may get to join the republican fat cats in washington after all 
radio station wblm began soliciting contributions wednesday to 
buy max a ticket to the june 12 dinner with president bush by 
midday the staion had received 400 in pledges 
the station launched its maxathon after receiving a call 
from the cats owner brian woodbury who was intrigued by the idea 
of having max dine with gop mucketymucks 
liz hamel of the national republican congressional committee 
which coordinates the annual dinner said earlier this week that 
invitations are sent to gop contributors 
either mr woodburys cat is on a mailing list or somebodys 
playing a joke ms hamel said 
if max wants to attend he can she said provided he comes 
up with the 1500 
woodbury and his wife jennifer said they had no idea why their 
feline was invited to the dinner especially since they are 
democrats who have never contributed to a political party 
woodbury said he had decided to let the matter drop but changed 
his mind tuesday and called the rock station to suggest a fund 
drive 
i know they do some really wild stuff said woodbury a 
24yearold accounting student and parttime employee of central 
maine power co 
captain herb ivy the wblm morning disc jockey said

barbara bush in a bathing suit 
if we dont raise all of the 1500 well probably give the 
money to the humane society ivy said

the democratic majority on the senate 
agriculture committee is proposing a 1 percent increase in target 
prices for wheat feed grains and cotton 
the proposal by the 10 democrats was placed before the nine 
republicans on the committee wednesday and could come up for a vote 
by next week staff aiders said 
the price support program would cost about 106 billion a year 
and is higher than the bush administration is seeking 
the proposal would increase the target prices in fiscal 1991 
which begins oct 1 and maintain the increase for the other four 
years of the fiveyear farm bill 
a rise in the consumer price index would automatically trigger 
additional target price increases but the agriculture secretary 
would have the option of then reducing the increase by four 
percentage points 
in an effort to dramatize the need for government involvement in 
agriculture sen kent conrad dnd sent bags of groceries to 
the other members of the senate on wednesday 
this bag of groceries would cost you about 1441 at a grocery 
store he said in an enclosed note just 140 of that will 
find its way back to the farmer 
he said a loaf of bread contains 7 cents worth of wheat a 
chocolate bar 1 cent worth of sugar soft drinks just 2 cents worth 
of corn sweetener 
over the past 10 years weve seen a steady disinvestment in 
agriculture he said net farm income has plummeted unless 
we restore some income security to agriculture there will be very 
few farmers to raise the crops of the new century and very few 
people in rural america to support american agriculture

the rural poor cannot eat nutritionally using 
food stamps says a report from a consumer group 
our study shows that the food stamp program is failing to 
provide adequate assistance to this vulnerable population because 
it does not consider the high costs faced by shoppers in poor rural 
america said ellen haas executive director of public voice for 
food amp health policy 
the organization surveyed 33 rural counties last summer that 
were considered representative of the 269 persistently poor rural 
counties nationwide 
they found 
nearly onethird of the food stamps were redeemed at smaller 
stores where prices were higher 
in three out of four supermarkets the food that the government 
expects a family of four to buy for 75 cost on average 81 
limited availability of fresh fruit vegetables and meats in 
the stores that redeemed food stamps 
only 30 percent of the competitively priced supermarkets are 
located in rural areas 
the house agriculture committee on tuesday approved a section of 
the farm bill on food stamps that attempts to respond to problems 
facing the rural poor

imported fruits and vegetables are likely to 
be contaminated by illegal pesticides according to data from the 
food and drug administration 
the information was released wednesday by sen patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the senate agriculture committee before the 
upcoming vote on his bill to ban us companies from selling 
chemicals abroad are kept off the market here for health reasons 
overall 5 percent of the imported produce examined by fda 
inspectors during the last two years was found to contain residue 
from pesticides that are not allowed to be sold to farmers in the 
united states 
the contamination rate may be even higher because the fda does 
not screen for all the possible pesticides that are used in foreign 
countries said leahy 
although fda is responsible for inspecting almost all imported 
food it only samples a minuscule 1 percent to 2 percent of the 
food entering this country said leahy the rest is simply 
waived through at the wharf 
about 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables eaten by americans 
come from other countries data on domestically grown produce 
showed little or no pesticides residues 
here is the extent by percentage to which 12 tested fruits and 
vegetables were found to be contaminated based on inspections 
between oct 1 1988 and april 13 1990 
peas 103 
eggplant 94 
cabbage 89 
pears 8 
peppers 74

consumers would have more uniform and accurate 
nutrition information on the food they buy under legislation making 
progress in congress 
the house energy and commerce committee on wednesday approved a 
labeling bill similar to a measure adopted last month by the senate 
labor and human resources committee the house and senate floors 
are the respective next steps for each 
rep henry waxman dcalif the primary author of the house 
legislation said it is intended to make sense of the confusing 
array of nutritional labels that now confront consumers each time 
they enter the supermarket 
through uniform standards to be developed by the food and drug 
administration the legislation also would regulate health and 
nutrition claims such as light low or lean on packages 
and assertions of their role in preventing cancer or heart disease 
current labeling practices have turned the grocery store aisle 
into a veritable minefield of false and misleading claims said 
bruce silverglade of the center for science in the public interest 
a consumer activist group 
the legislation would preempt state food labeling laws on 
nutrition but not food safety such has health warnings or 
consumer economic issues such as freshness dating or unit pricing 
meat poultry and egg products are specifically exempted 
labels on processed foods and posted signs and brochures for 
fresh produce and fish would be required to uniformly specify the 
amount of total fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium total 
carbohydrates complex carbohydrates sugars dietary fiber and 
total protein for each serving 
the bill was sent to the full house on a voice vote after the 
energy and commerce committees chairman rep john dingell 
dmich rejected industryled efforts to preempt state laws 
requiring labels to also contain warnings about chemical 
contaminants and carcinogens 
also rejected by a 2419 vote was an amendment to exempt fresh 
fruit vegetables and fish from the nutrition reporting 
requirements entirely 
supporters of the amendment said extending the requirements 
beyond processed and prepackaged foods puts too much of a burden 
on grocery stores and is unneeded since most consumers already are 
aware of the nutritional value of fresh fruits vegetables and fish 
if any yuppies in america want to know how much fat is in an 
avocado they can find that out by going through journals in a 
library said rep wj billy tauzin dla 
but proponents of the requirement said it would be nonsensical 
to exempt the very kinds of foods that people are most likely to 
eat if they are dietconscious 
the preemption issue has divided both the congress and the bush 
administration 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan for example 
has sided against the food industry in directing that new labeling 
requirements being developed by the fda should not preempt tougher 
state laws 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who has jurisdiction over 
label requirements on meat poultry and egg products has taken the 
opposite tack he says statebystate labeling only drives costs up 
for consumers and sets a bad example for international trade 
dingell refused wednesday to allow votes on extending the 
federal preemption over state laws to potentially hazardous food 
ingredients ruling they were not germane to the nutrition issue 
sought by 16 food industry trade associations the amendments 
were focused particularly at preempting a california law that 
requires food labels to list any possible cancercausing 
ingredients

home builders and some congressmen are 
mounting a campaign against a credit crunch they say is 
crippling the construction industry and threatening the loss of 
200000 jobs 
coinciding with a commerce department report wednesday about the 
smallest number of housing starts since the last recession the 
national association of home builders called a news conference to 
announce the details of their latest industry survey 
association president martin perlman said the survey showed that 
builders are being indiscriminately cut off from the credit 
markets production is dropping people are losing their jobs and 
businesses the disruptions in the housing delivery system are far 
more severe than anyone anticipated 
the commerce report said housing starts had dropped 58 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 125 million units the 
lowest level since 117 million units were started at an annual 
rate in october 1982 
at issue the home builders said is the new savings and loan 
bailout law that limits the amount of loans to an individual and 
tightens requirements for loans by commercial banks 
however other housing industry observers say steep mortgage 
rates overbuilding and the high cost of new homes also contribute 
to the downturn in construction 
the sampl reform law limits to 15 percent the amount of capital 
that a thrift institution can lend to one borrower before the law 
was enacted last august thrifts could lend as much as 100 percent 
of their funds to a single builder 
rep peter hoagland dneb told the news conference that 68 
congressmen have joined him in sponsoring a bill that would remedy 
the problem by permitting a transition period during which builders 
could find alternative sources of construction funds 
hoagland said he believes the bill will reach the house floor 
within two weeks a similar bill has been introduced in the senate 
by sen richard shelby dala 
further complicating the situation is the fact that commercial 
banks have not been able to pick up the slack and are tightening 
their lending requirements due to a february bulletin from the 
comptroller of the currency warning commercial banks about the 
dangers of real estate lending and urging bank examiners to look 
closely at all of the real estate loans in the banks under their 
jurisdiction perlman said 
this is having an inhibiting effect on housing finance that is 
clearly reflected in our survey results he added he welcomed a 
statement last week by bank regulators saying that banks should 
keep making loans to qualified customers 
hopefully that message will get out to the bank examiners 
perlman said 
meanwhile he said the credit crunch has caused the builders 
group to revise its 1990 housing starts forecast downward from 142 
million units to 128 million 
this decrease of 140000 housing starts translates into the 
loss of 200000 jobs for an entire year 6 billion in wages and 2 
billion in taxes at all levels perlman said

senate leaders are moving their efforts to 
find a compromise on campaign finance reform behind closed doors 
after staking out widely divergent party opening positions in 
public 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine and republican leader 
bob dole of kansas on wednesday each named five senators from their 
parties to begin what is expected to be long and arduous weeks of 
negotiations 
i remain optimistic but no one should expect any miracles 
dole said obviously there are many different points of view and 
many areas of disagreement 
dole appointed sen mitch mcconnell of kentucky one of the most 
vehement opponents of campaign spending ceilings that are the key 
feature of the democratic bill to head the republican team 
other members include sens warren rudman rnh bob packwood 
rore and don nickles rokla with sen ted stevens of alaska 
the ranking republican on the senate rules committee serving as an 
adviser 
sen david boren of oklahoma the primary author of the 
democratic measure was named to head his partys team other 
members are sens john kerry dmass john breaux dla and 
thomas daschle dsd 
mitchell said he and sen wendell ford dky chairman of the 
senate rules committee will monitor and guide the discussions 
from the democratic side 
none of us have any illusions about the difficulty of this 
process mitchell said democrats and republicans have tended 
to see this issue from vastly different perspectives 
mitchell and dole last week brought widely contrasting bills to 
the senate floor on behalf of their parties last week each in the 
name of reform basically seeks to rein in the current advantages 
held by the other party 
democrats would establish voluntary ceilings on how much 
candidates can spend equal to about twothirds of what was spent on 
the last election and outlaw contributions by political action 
committees directly to candidates 
compliance would be encouraged through a public finance scheme 
in which voluntary contribution of up to 3 a year through income 
tax returns would pick up about half of a candidates combined 
primary and general election campaign costs 
republicans are calling for a total abolition of pacs and are 
seeking to sharply curtail democrats historic reliance upon labor 
unions for grassroots getoutthevote efforts 
both parties claim their bills plug current loopholes of the 
type that allowed savings and loan entrepreneur charles h keating 
jr to pour 13 million into the election campaigns of five 
senators now under investigation for alleged ethical misconduct

sen david durenberger rminn held his 
first private talks with the senate ethics committee since the 
panel found substantial credible evidence that he violated 
federal law and senate rules 
sen warren rudman rnh committee vice chairman told 
reporters that wednesdays meeting with durenburger did not resolve 
the case which is set for hearings beginning june 12 
any meetings before the triallike hearings could be 
significant because durenberger said earlier this month that he 
believed the committee was pushing him to negotiate a settlement of 
the case 
durenbergers spokeswoman lois west confirmed this was the 
first time the senator had met with the panel since it filed 
allegations of wrongdoing involving his financial dealings but she 
would not comment on the substance of the talks 
when the committee scheduled the hearings durenberger said 
its a matter of wanting to bring this to a head whether the 
hearing is going to be necessary well have to wait until early 
june to make a decision 
those comments were made before the committee significantly 
expanded the allegations last week making durenbergers defense 
more difficult 
last week the panel found substantial credible evidence of 
financial wrongdoing misrepresentations to the senate and improper 
administration of durenbergers blind trust 
those allegations covering august 1983 to november 1989 all 
are related to transactions involving a minneapolis condominium 
that durenberger partly owned while collecting senate 
reimbursements for his stays there he has been a senator since 
november 1978 
last weeks announcement also said the ethics committee had 
found substantial cause to conclude that durenberger had 
misused united states senate funds through a pattern of improper 
conduct which has brought discredit upon the united states senate 
in february the committee found substantial credible 
evidence that the law and senate rules were violated on two other 
matters a book deal under which durenberger made speeches and 
accepted fees to promote two books he wrote and his acceptance of 
free limousine service for personal trips in the boston area these 
allegations covered events in 198586

solicitor general kenneth starr supports 
attorney general dick thornburghs decision not to discipline his 
chief spokesman for confirming the existence of a criminal 
investigation involving a congressman 
but starr who had been asked to review the matter by 
thornburgh said in a statement wednesday night that he identified 
certain concerns of an administrative nature that prompted the 
attorney general to make procedural changes 
starr reviewed the issue after thornburgh confirmed that his 
chief spokesman david runkel had been a secondary source of 
the story that the fbi was investigating financial irregularities 
in the office of rep william h gray iii dpa 
runkel and thornburghs chief of staff robert s ross jr who 
were both questioned and given liedetector tests during an 
investigation of the leak were reassigned to other duties monday 
in a move officials said was unrelated to the gray case 
both men showed evidence of deception during polygraph tests 
said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity but the sources 
stressed that the evidence of deception occurred during responses 
to tangential questions 
the investigation determined that ross was not a source of the 
information contained in the cbs story officials said 
the gray story was aired last spring while the congressman was 
running for house majority whip it proved politically embarrassing 
for thornburgh who has made plugging unauthorized news leaks a 
hallmark of his stormy tenure at the justice department 
democratic lawmakers charged the leak was politically inspired 
the justice department then took the unusual step of issuing a 
statement that gray was not a target of the investigation 
thornburgh also ordered the massive leak investigation which 
subsequently failed to identify the original source of the 
information 
in his statement starr said he concurred with the earlier 
finding that there was no basis for criminal prosecution 
involving the leak 
starr agreed that there is no evidence that any official in 
the justice departments headquarters or the us attorneys office 
in philadelphia was the source of the original unauthorized 
disclosure 
runkel and ross were reassigned to other duties monday in an 
attempt by thornburgh to correct the public image that he runs the 
justice department through a tight circle of politically loyal 
aides 
department spokesman daniel eramian said starrs findings were 
totally unrelated to the personnel changes that took place this 
week 
he declined to describe the procedural changes that thornburgh 
ordered to correct the administrative concerns identified by starr 
starr said he didnt recommend that any disciplinary action be 
taken against any department of justice official and concluded 
it was appropriately within the discretion of the attorney 
general to determine that no disciplinary action is warranted 
starr said he concluded that the matter may be appropriately 
closed 
thornburgh last month had defended runkels handling of the 
episode saying the spokesman was following standing orders not to 
mislead reporters 
thornburgh had said runkel did not steer cbs reporter rita 
braver off information that she had obtained from other sources 
starr noted several of the 10 people who were given liedetector 
tests experienced difficulties on some aspects of their polygraph 
examinations although he said there was no evidence the original 
leak came from the justice headquarters or us attorneys office 
in philadelphia 
runkel who had been accused by reporters of giving them 
misleading and incorrect information on numerous occasions was 
appointed communications director and will no longer act as the 
departments spokesman 
a search for a new director of the office of public affairs is 
under way 
ross who is planning to return to private law practice in two 
or three months was assigned to organize a new office of 
international operations

mayor marion barrys lawyer is seeking 
dismissal of the half dozen new drug and conspiracy charges against 
his client 
r kenneth mundy filed the motion for dismissal wednesday after 
barry pleaded innocent a day earlier to six additional charges 
brought against him 
mundy complained that the new charges would not allow the 
mayors defense team to prepare adequately for the trial scheduled 
to begin in us district court in washington on june 4 
the lawyer maintains that the six new charges are vindictive 
and an undue burden because they were brought just three weeks 
before the trial date 
the new charges accuse barry of five misdemeanor counts of 
cocaine possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy the 
mayor took drugs as far back as 1984 the new indictment alleges 
barry previously pleaded innocent to eight charges brought feb 
15 alleging that he lied to a federal grand jury and that he 
possessed cocaine on five occasions

dominicans crowded 
polling stations wednesday to pick a president in an election 
pitting conservative incumbent joaquin balaguer who is 83 and 
blind against an 80yearold marxist rival 
leftist former president juan bosch took an early lead in 
initial sketchy returns 
with only 324 of the 6663 or 5 percent of the polling 
stations reporting bosch had 24907 votes to balaguers 20967 
the electoral board said about 32 million people were registered 
to vote 
the board announced the first results on television at 115 am 
thursday more than one hour behind schedule board president 
froilan tavares apologized for the delay but gave no explanation 
earlier tavares said there were some insignificant voting 
irregularities but he said they were not serious enough to affect 
the outcome 
both bosch and balaguer a fivetime president said they were 
confident of victory in their fifth matchup to lead this caribbean 
nation of 7 million people 
i will accept the voting results whatever they may be said 
balaguer who was blinded by glaucoma after casting his vote 
but i trust dominicans will reelect me for another four 
years 
bosch voting earlier at the same polling station in the capital 
of santo domingo said i am not optimistic or pessimistic i am 
realistic because everyone knows we won this election a long time 
ago 
the turnout appeared heavy in the normally bustling capital 
which ground to a virtual standstill lines formed for blocks at 
some polling stations 
soldiers stood on street corners but no disturbances were 
reported most shops and offices were closed in the city of 2 
million alcohol sales were banned for the day 
former president jimmy carter accompanied by his wife rosalynn 
joined about 30 international observers monitoring the vote to 
ensure against ballot fraud 
police said at least six people were injured outside the capital 
monday night in clashes between opposing political supporters 
bosch leader of the dominican liberation party describes 
himself as a marxist but not a communist he has moderated his 
stands in recent years and during this campaign pledged to work 
for good relations with the united states and to promote capitalism 
he has written more than 40 books novels short stories poems 
and latin american and caribbean histories he was nominated last 
year for the nobel prize in literature 
boschs party has been claiming balaguer organizers prepared 
300000 phony ballots to rig the vote a charge denied by 
balaguers party 
balaguer leader of the social christian reformist party pinned 
his hopes largely on a 2 billion publicworks project to transform 
centuriesold santo domingo the project was planned in part to 
coincide with 1992 celebrations of the 500th anniversary of 
columbus arrival in the new world 
the president a lawyer and himself the author of more than 20 
books ran under the slogan balaguer a road without danger 
he portrayed bosch as a dangerous marxist 
balaguers publicworks project has created thousands of new 
jobs but his popularity has slumped as the countrys economic 
problems deepened dominicans have contended with chronic 
electricity blackouts and water shortages 
bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points the past 
year but some observers believe he may be hurt by his criticism 
last week of a 1954 agreement with the vatican providing all army 
chaplains be roman catholic this nation which shares the island 
of hispaniola with haiti is overwhelmingly catholic 
in 1963 bosch became the countrys first democratically elected 
president after the assassination of dictator gen rafael trujillo 
two years earlier only seven months into office he was ousted in 
a military coup 
an attempt by rebel soldiers to restore bosch to the presidency 
led to civil war in 1965 and prompted president lyndon johnson to 
send in 23000 us marines to prevent a leftist takeover 
balaguer rose to power under the 31year trujillo dictatorship 
serving briefly as the generals figurehead president he was first 
elected president in his own right in 1966 and served three 
consecutive fouryear terms before losing in 1978 he returned to 
power in 1986 
other candidates for president were jose francisco pena gomez 
52 a former mayor of santo domingo and civil war hero who leads 
the socialist dominican revolutionary party and jacobo majluta 
55 leader of the centerleft independent revolutionary party 
voters also chose a vice president 30 senators 120 
congressional deputies and more than 100 mayors

officials are violating the human rights of illegal 
foreign workers by threatening them with prison and fines under a 
law taking effect june 1 a pakistani worker says 
they treat us like jungle animals shahab ammed one of an 
estimated 100000 undocumented foreign workers in japan told a 
news conference wednesday we are bound here like we are living 
in a zoo 
ammed wearing dark glasses spoke in halting english to about 
100 reporters with the rev hidetoshi watanabe who is chairman of 
an association that helps foreign workers 
watanabe a united church of christ minister said the justice 
ministrys immigration bureau is deliberately misleading illegal 
workers by implying they face up to three years in prison or fines 
of about 13000 under the new immigration law 
in fact he said the new law applies only to employers and 
brokers who hire illegal workers after june 1 
my guess is they are trying to scare all the undocumented 
workers out of the country watanabe said 
thousands of illegal workers are rushing to turn themselves in 
and be deported before the law takes effect officials say 
justice ministry spokesman takashi nakamura said he had heard no 
reports of harassment of foreign workers he said punishment under 
the new law applies only to employers or brokers but the workers 
themselves may be jailed fined or deported as under the current 
law 
in 1989 16608 people were convicted of working illegally in 
japan the ministry says but few workers have been punished 
watanabe said 
unlike many developed countries japan does not allow foreigners 
to come in as unskilled laborers but thousands of foreigners enter 
on tourist or student visas then stay on to work in lowpaying 
factory or construction jobs after their visas expire 
women from the philippines south korea and thailand work 
illegally in japans massive sex industry and many americans 
without the proper documentation are teaching english although the 
number of illegal workers is officially estimated at 108000 the 
number may be as high as 300000 watanabe said 
ammed said he earns about 1777 a month doing clerical work for 
a plastics company he said unskilled foreign workers generally 
earn about 460 an hour and many work 12 hours a day 
many japanese companies would fail without the illegal foreign 
labor he said 
the new generation in japan has no interest in this low and 
hard work said ammed he suggested that since japan needs the 
workers it should pardon them and establish procedures for 
admitting more as other industrialized countries have done 
but the problem is compounded by japans wariness of foreigners 
especially those with darker skin ammed said that even when he was 
in japan legally he was hounded by police angrily demanding to see 
his passport and accusing him of lying 
ammed gave watanabe a letter signed by 190 illegal workers 
appealing for an immigration law that would help foreign workers 
watanabe said he would present it friday to the justice ministry 
ammed said he faced the risk of arrest by coming forward but was 
willing to sacrifice himself to improve the lot of illegal workers 
we will fight in favor of human rights until we die he 
said if the police arrest me a second will come they cant 
arrest us all

never saw anyone give so much

me in 1989 in the latter he described his allnight partying 
endless drug use and womanizing the hallmark of the 1960s rat

friend not only to me but to anyone whose life he touched said 
martin 
jerry lewis wept as he spoke about davis i lost a brother

him

davis once said while other kids my age were playing with 
marbles and toys i knew only about the backstage dressing rooms 
when he was 18 davis joined the army and experienced prejudice

three retirees who set out on the huck 
finn adventure they missed in their youth got a little more than 
they bargained for on a nineday trip they found out why its 
called the mighty mississippi 
its not a trip for the faint of heart said irving glazer 
70 who took on 900 miles of the mississippi river with alvin 
levenson 67 and stanley herman 66 all of indianapolis 
the three set out from cairo ill aboard not a raft but a 
24foot pontoon boat the silver fox they ended up at baton rouge 
la weary from struggling against currents sandbars and the giant 
workboats that ply the river 
they had intended to continue on to new orleans but took a look 
at the seagoing vessels docked at baton rouge and decided to finish 
the trip by car 
in mark twains 1884 novel huckleberry finn and jim jump off 
their raft just before it is run over by a paddlewheel steamer the 
only steamboats the indianapolis three saw were of the tourist 
variety but they got their fill of barges 
mississippi barges carry up to 1500 tons each and the lower 
river is their workyard that with the logs and other debris in 
the water made for tough maneuvering for the modernday huck finns 
it was like riding a bicycle on an interstate levenson said 
the trip got off to a rough wet start when the fox left cairo 
at the confluence of the ohio and mississippi rivers on may 2 
fighting heavy head winds and pounding waves 
none of us dreamed we would hit fourfoot waves on a river 
but we did levenson said 
the second day out the travelers ran into a sandbar between 
hickman ky and memphis and radioed the coast guard for help a 
rescue squad from reelfoot lake tenn freed the boat and cleaned 
the sand out of its 60horsepower outboard 
they said they really appreciated us calling them because it 
was the first rescue theyd had this year said levenson 
the indianapolis three were retired businessmen expecting a 
leisurely trip but they got little use out of the lawn chairs and 
batteryoperated tv they had packed the river current changed 
often and the water was full of debris 
we had to keep a spotter up front the whole trip levenson 
said 
the three spent four nights on the boat but found overnight 
accommodations ashore the rest of the time 
unlike huck finn they never stumbled into a bloody feud between 
two families and never got mixed up in a con game no one nearly 
drowned still they found some of the same scenery twain described 
in the 19th century 
levenson said it was lonely amid the thick woods lining the 
riverbanks 
there wasnt a living soul for miles there is nothing along 
that bank no telephone poles or any sign of life levenson said 
when we got to memphis there were a few pleasure boats outside 
of that there wasnt another pleasure boat on the whole trip 
below memphis the travelers hung up on another sandbar and this 
time no help was around 
we took off our clothes and got into the water there we were 
three old guys in the mississippi river pushing and pushing until 
we got back into the deep water levenson said 
while the trip was rougher than expected glazer said hes ready 
to do it again 
its the most exciting thing i think ive ever done he 
said it was a challenge and there was an element of danger

the death of jim henson whose warm and fuzzy 
muppets like kermit the frog taught and delighted millions 
worldwide shocked those who appreciated his art but they said 
theyre glad his work will live on 
theres a lot less sunshine in the world today opera singer 
beverly sills said after hensons death at age 53 wednesday of 
complications from pneumonia 
henson created the muppets in 1954 kermit and some of his pals 
made their debut on a washington tv program sam and friends 
which won an emmy in 1959 during the 1960s henson and his troupe 
appeared regularly on the jimmy dean show and the ed sullivan 
show 
but the muppets popularity exploded into a worldwide phenomenon 
after they began appearing on sesame street in 1969 
millions of children in 80 countries grew up watching kermit 
cookie monster oscar the grouch big bird bert and ernie 
cavorting on the show which teaches basic english and math to 
preschoolers 
he was our generations charlie chaplin mae west wc fields 
and marx brothers and he drew from all of them to create a new art 
form said joan ganz cooney chairman and chief executive officer 
of childrens television workshop which produces sesame street 
he took our breath away as a talent and provided laughter and 
love as a friend fortunately for the children of the world jim 
hensons work will live on 
opera singer placido domingo actor danny devito and singer lena 
horne were among the reallife stars who performed with the muppets 
miss horne said henson was absent tuesday from a gathering of 
the sesame street cast and friends but she had no idea he was 
near death 
this has just overwhelmed me said miss horne 
in 1976 henson introduced the muppet show which starred 
the mae weststyle femme fatale miss piggy the show won three 
emmys during its fiveyear run and became the most widely seen tv 
program in the world some 235 million viewers in 100 countries 
watched it 
the muppets in dark and macabre form also appeared in the 
first year of saturday night live in 1975 
hensons puppets moved to the big screen in 1979 with the 
muppet movie followed by the great muppet caper in 1981 and 
the muppets take manhattan in 1984 
his magic touch was evident again this year with his work on the 
boxoffice smash teenage mutant ninja turtles 
henson a rumpled figure with shaggy hair and a beard said the 
word muppet was something he just made up although to appease 
interviewers he would say it was a combination of marionette 
and puppet besides kermit he did the voices of ernie and 
gameshow host guy smiley 
puppets have the same sort of graceful aging that cartoon 
characters have henson said in 1986 im sure kermit will stay 
younger a lot longer than i will 
hensons death was the third to strike sesame street in the 
past year joe raposo who wrote many of the songs for the popular 
childrens series died last year at age 52 former cast member 
northern calloway also died recently 
a sesame street spokeswoman said it was too soon to say how 
hensons passing would affect the show 
dr david m gelmont who treated henson at new york hospital 
was asked by a reporter if henson had aids he said he had 
pneumonia definitely absolutely no aids 
henson had been admitted to the hospital early tuesday with 
galloping pneumonia untreated for at least three days gelmont 
said 
asked why henson failed to seek more aggressive treatment for 
his illness jim henson productions spokeswoman susan berry said 
my guess is hes totally absorbed he couldnt be bothered he 
was very cavalier with his health 
henson was born in greenville miss in 1936 he married in 
1959 and with his wife jane had five children they range in age 
from 19 to 30 
he directed the fantasy films the dark crystal in 1982 and 
labyrinth in 1986 
henson won a peabody award for excellence in tv programming a 
grammy for a muppet album and four consecutive emmys for 
outstanding animation for his saturday morning cartoon the 
muppet babies

a widely used spermicide hailed for its 
ability to prevent aids and venereal disease can cause bladder and 
yeast infections in women some of whom should consider another 
method of birth control scientists say 
the spermicide nonoxynol9 is the active ingredient in most 
contraceptive foams jellies and creams some condoms are packaged 
with the spermicide 
the research provides the first evidence that nonoxynol9 can 
trigger the uncomfortable urinary and vaginal infections even when 
the spermicide is used without a diaphragm vaginal sponge or 
condom said dr thomas hooton who conducted two studies at the 
university of washington in seattle 
earlier studies suggested that diaphragms and sponges cause the 
infections spermicides had not been previously studied separately 
nonoxynol9 has been hailed in recent years for its ability to 
prevent the spread of diseases such as aids 
nonoxynol9 is an extremely effective agent against many 
sexually transmitted diseases as well as sperm said jackie 
mcgroarty a toronto general hospital microbiologist who conducted 
a third study 
but she said she wouldnt recommend a woman stop using it unless 
the woman suffered recurrent infections and was in a stable 
monogamous relationship that put her at low risk of aids and 
other sexually transmitted diseases 
mcgroarty said bladder and yeast infections cause discomfort but 
arent dangerous compared with sexually transmitted diseases or 
unwanted pregnancy birth control pills previously have been linked 
to yeast infections 
hooton said if women want to continue using spermicides despite 
infection they can get antibiotics for the infection 
mcgroarty presented her findings wednesday in anaheim during the 
american society for microbiologys annual meeting hootons 
research has been submitted for publication in medical journals 
dr amy pollack associate medical director of the planned 
parenthood federation of america said she hadnt seen the studies 
but what she ms mcgroarty is saying makes sense 
phyliss barber regulatory affairs manager for spermicidemaker 
schmid laboratories inc said she was surprised by the studies and 
hadnt seen them 
we definitely will be taking a look she said by telephone 
from little falls nj 
representatives of ortho pharmaceutical corp and schering corp 
had no immediate comment on the studies 
mcgroarty grew yeast and e coli the bacteria responsible for 
most bladder infections in the laboratory with nonoxynol9 and 
the kind of cells that line the vagina and urethra or urine tube 
in the presence of nonoxynol9 the yeast and bacteria underwent 
changes that made them stick to the cells in great numbers 
suggesting the spermicide helps the microbes colonize the vaginal 
and urinary tract 
mcgroarty also found nonoxynol9 killed lactobacilli harmless 
bacteria that grow in the vagina to protect against infections 
the seattle studies which involved 130 women found those who 
used spermicides alone or with diaphragms or condoms were more 
likely than other women to develop infections or to have high 
levels of e coli bacteria 
bladder infection or cystitis occurs when bacteria travel up 
the urethra to the bladder yeast infections are vaginal 
overgrowths of a fungus both cause burning or stinging during 
urination and a frequent urge to urinate 
bladder infections produce strongsmelling and perhaps bloody 
urine and sometimes discomfort and fever yeast infections cause 
itching swelling irritation thick white discharge and pain 
during intercourse

nazi medical experiments on concentration camp 
prisoners were more than brutal and unethical a report today 
concludes they were also bad science 
researchers and ethicists have been debating whether the results 
of german experiments conducted during world war ii should be used 
by modernday experts studying the effects of cold on the body 
at the dachau concentration camp nazi doctors plunged prisoners 
into icy water often for hours at a time so they could test 
various methods of rewarming them 
some experts have contended that regardless of their source the 
data should still be used to help doctors treat hypothermia or low 
body temperature others believe that no matter how valuable the 
information it should be ignored because of the unacceptable 
methods used to obtain it 
the latest report concludes that this longrunning ethical 
debate should end because the nazi data has no value to anyone 
the implication was that there was this great information and 
we could save lives if only we could use it said dr robert l 
berger a surgeon at new england deaconess hospital in boston 
after reviewing the original nazi data however berger 
discovered that the experiments were so poorly set up and carried 
out that the results cannot be believed 
the data are useless he said its not scientific it 
should be rejected outright there should be no ethical discussion 
over it you dont discuss scientifically useless data you discuss 
data that have scientific merit but were obtained in an unethical 
fashion 
berger presented his findings and conclusions in todays issue 
of the new england journal of medicine 
in an accompanying editorial dr marcia angell the journals 
executive editor said the notion that there exists a treasure 
trove of valid information on hypothermia from which we are 
voluntarily and fastidiously holding ourselves aloof seems to be 
baseless 
ethicist arthur caplan of the university of minnesota who 
organized a conference last year on nazi science said other nazi 
research into such areas as genetics and anthropology has already 
been absorbed into the mainstream of science 
berger appears to give a persuasive argument that there is not 
much to argue about with respect to hypothermia caplan said 
that doesnt mean the ethical debate about nazi science and 
medicine should be dismissed out of hand 
dr robert pozos of the university of washington who in the 
past has advocated use of the nazi results said after reading 
bergers report that the experimenters scientific methods were 
atrocious he added my opinion is that the data should not 
be referenced in other research papers it should not be used 
the experiments were intended to find the best way to treat 
victims of hypothermia especially german fliers who were shot down 
over the cold north sea male civilians of various religions and 
nationalities as well as russian prisoners of war were forced to 
participate 
the subjects were plunged into a tank of ice water often naked 
and then rewarmed with various methods some died after spending 
several hours in the tank others were killed by the rewarming 
which included throwing the men into boiling water 
berger found that such basic details as the mens ages 
nutritional status general health and blood pressures were 
missing also frequently unrecorded were many particulars about the 
experiments and their results such as water temperatures length 
of time in the water and the survival rates after various rewarming 
methods 
some findings were so physiologically improbable that they were 
probably fabricated berger concluded among these was the 
conclusion that people die of hypothermia in the water only if 
their necks are submerged 
he also noted that dr sigmund rascher the chief experimenter 
was accused of faking other experiments and had sold saddles 
riding breeches and handbags made from human skin 
rascher was eventually executed by the germans for kidnapping 
children he had claimed that his wife had three babies in quick 
succession after age 48 the hoax was intended to please heinrich 
himmler head of the german concentration camps by proving that 
the growth of the aryan people could be speeded up by extending 
womens childbearing years

some of the swamped communities along the trinity 
river in texas were built before zoning regulations prohibited 
construction in the flood plain officials said 
torrential rains two weeks ago damaged about 400 homes in 
rochester park a dallas neighborhood about 7000 residents below 
lake livingston north of houston were warned this week to 
evacuate subdivisions because of the worst flooding in 80 years 
both areas now have restrictions on flood plain development but 
that wasnt always the case officials said 
rochester park most of whose residents are black has been 
flooded two years running its civic leaders say dallas failure to 
provide flood protection demonstrates a lack of interest in 
minority communities 
city officials deny that 
we recognized that theyve been in the flood plain of the 
trinity since rochester park was first developed said assistant 
city manager cliff keheley but at the time it developed flood 
plain delineation wasnt the exact science that it is today 
today we have some strong requirements on development said 
tommie mcpherson of the dallas public works department the 
problem you have with places like rochester park is that you cant 
make new flood control policy retroactive its not like we can go 
in and move people out of their homes 
mcpherson said the rochester park area was developed in the 
1920s and was annexed to dallas in the early 1950s it wasnt until 
1964 that the city began flood development plans new homes must be 
at least 3 feet above the 100year flood plain 
keheley said cost requirements had slowed construction of a 
levee to protect the community officials say it will be built by 
1993 
in the contact that i had with the project i didnt see any 
kind of intentional neglect and i dont think it was racially 
based at all keheley said 
at lake livingston some 200 miles southeast of dallas the 
trinity river authority released water through the lake livingston 
dams floodgates at a record rate of 94800 cubic feet per second 
wednesday 
a discharge rate of 100000 cubic feet per second level was 
expected by monday and would last about a week said grady manis 
the authoritys southern region manager 
barry brock assistant city manager in liberty texas which 
lies below the lake said as much as 45 percent of city land lies 
in the flood plain 
the city enacted an ordinance in 1974 saying that new 
development must be a foot above the 100year flood plain the 
highest level water has gotten in the state during a century but 
that ordinance doesnt affect several homes built before 1974 
we cant go back and make people rebuild brock said

following two irish republican army bombings in 
london in three days britains armed forces minister says he 
believes the capital is being subjected to a systematic terror 
campaign 
the official archie hamilton said the bombings outside an 
army recruiting center wednesday and at an army education office 
monday marked the first time london had seen two attacks so close 
together 
i think we are being subjected to a campaign of terror by them 
the ira hamilton said in an interview with channel 4 
television wednesday night this is a new situation and we must 
assume they will try elsewhere possibly in the london area in the 
near future 
an army sergeant was killed and another injured in the bombing 
wednesday in wembley in north london the ira fighting to end 
british rule in northern ireland claimed responsibility for the 
bombing in a statement to news organizations in dublin wednesday 
night 
while the british government persists in its continued 
occupation of the north of ireland the ira will persist in 
attacking the british government and its forces in england the 
ira said in a statement 
the bomb exploded in a white unmarked army van parked behind an 
army careers information office run by the territorial army 
britains parttime volunteer reserve force 
scotland yard said the bomb exploded at just after charles 
chapman and another sergeant got into the vehicle 
chapman 34 was killed the other sergeant who was sitting in 
the back of the van suffered severe cuts bruises and smoke 
inhalation two passersby were treated for shock 
the sergeants worked at the recruiting office on a busy 
shopping street about a half mile from wembley stadium one of 
britains top sports arenas 
before wednesdays explosion 12 people had been killed and one 
crippled in attacks in mainland britain since august 1988 
on monday a time bomb buried in a flower bed blew a hole in the 
building housing the directorate of army education at eltham in 
southeast london injuring seven civilians the ira claimed 
responsibility 
security at the facilities at eltham and wembley was minimal 
the ira has targeted british military installations in northern 
ireland mainland britain and the rest of europe since sectarian 
and political violence flared in the province in 1969 
but it has repeatedly said that in terms of publicity one bomb 
in mainland britain is worth dozens in northern ireland ten of 
londons 12 newspapers today made the wembley attack their main 
story 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the 95 percent catholic republic of 
ireland under socialist rule

of ronald gene goode a 22yearold a soft drink salesman 
in the statement typed by a fellow death row inmate and 
containing numerous misspellings anderson criticized the justice 
system as unfair and inconsiderate of the victums family he 
called himself the excape goat 
you people out there dont understand any of this either 
because you dont care enough to check or you will have to wait 
until your the one on the table getting killed then as always it 
will be to late then you will understand how unfair the system 
really is for all parties involved anderson wrote 
texas attorney general jim mattox who witnessed the execution 
dismissed andersons claims of innocence even if he was not the 
person who pulled the trigger he would still be culpable for the 
murder mattox said 
andersons lawyers contended in their appeals that his mental 
shortcomings were not considered by the jury that gave him the 
death sentence 
the us supreme court earlier this year ordered the texas court 
of criminal appeals to reconsider a similar case involving another 
condemned man john henry selvage andersons appeal was based on 
that case 
andersons sister and goodes wife laura anderson goode and 
delvin johnson were convicted of murder sentenced to life in 
prison and paroled last year andersons mother rowena was 
acquitted of capital murder in the case

about 100 flight attendants for alaska airlines 
have reported suffering nausea headaches and other health problems 
during several dozen flights in the last eight months the 
attendants union said 
the association of flight attendants said some passengers also 
have complained of develping headaches or feeling strange 
some attendants said they think the problems are caused by bad 
air in the jets in many cases they said the symptoms cleared up 
when they left the aircraft or were treated with oxygen 
airline president bruce kennedy suggested the fears were 
unfounded he said wednesday the company had received no formal 
complaints from passengers and had logged fewer than 50 from 
attendants 
i think we need at this point to back up from the notion that 
air quality is the source of the problem kennedy said i think 
that a strong case can be made for the notion that the power of 
suggestion is operating here 
bill cox a company vice president said problems had been 
reported on about three dozen flights out of roughly 13000 and 
often involved just one or two of the four attendants aboard 
the union said symptoms have included dizziness confusion 
swollen lymph glands blurred vision vomiting weakness and other 
problems some lasting for weeks 
the first reports of illness came july 29 involving four flight 
attendants on a seattle to orange county calif flight they were 
unable to make the return flight several did not work for a month 
or more 
airline officials were unable to find anything wrong with the 
plane and doctors could not determine what made the attendants 
sick 
after reports of health problems persisted the seattlebased 
airline sought help from university of washington specialists and 
the national institute for occupational safety and health 
its frustrating cox has said we cant find any problems 
to fix 
cox said the complaints concerned about 15 of the airlines 57 
aircraft he said eight or so reports were linked to specific 
problems such as a fuel leak in one plane and smoke from a galley 
oven in another plane 
after the initial report in july and discussions with the 
federal aviation administration alaska airlines said it agreed to 
clear air grilles place airsample bottles on aircraft and analyze 
cargo aboard when problems occurred 
not one indication was given that there was any problem with 
the air quality aboard an airplane said ray vecci an executive 
vice president 
cox said cargo has since been ruled out as a source because 
there has been no hazardous material aboard the flights involved 
except for one 
no pilots have complained of the symptoms

two jewish followers of a messianic cult 
acknowleged they desecrated more than 300 jewish graves in hopes 
that arabs would be suspected and jews would then unite against 
perceived arab hostility police said today 
the two men confessed wednesday night after initially denying 
involvement haifa police official yonah shlomo said 
the official said 41yearold david goldner admitted he 
spraypainted 303 graves at a cemetery in the northern port city on 
sunday with antisemitic slogans in hebrew such as kill the 
jews 
gershon tannenbaum 32 also agreed to cooperate with police 
shlomo said the davar newspaper quoted tannenbaum as saying he 
watched the desecration but did not participate 
goldner recently quit his job as a computer scientist involved 
in weapons development and joined a messianic group israel media 
said in the weeks prior to sundays desecration goldner lived at 
the graveyard israel radio quoted police as saying 
davar quoted goldner as saying i wanted to unite the nation 
of israel which is involved in internal arguments while it faces 
danger from arab nations 
goldner originally denied he carried out the vandalism but when 
he was remanded in police custody for 15 days on tuesday he told 
reporters i was fulfilling a sacred mission 
a haifa court on wednesday remanded tannenbaum into custody for 
12 days 
israel radio said tannenbaum persuaded goldner to join him in a 
group that practices a mystic form of judaism based on the belief 
it can hasten the arrival of the messiah 
national police commissioner yaakov turner said goldner and 
tannenbaum were probably inspired by the desecration last week of 
34 graves in the french town of carpentras where the body of an 
81yearold man was dug up and impaled on an umbrella 
the haifa desecration sparked anger among haifas jewish 
residents and some accused arabs of the vandalism moslem leaders 
immediately condemned the desecration

radicals trying to elect populist boris n yeltsin 
president of the soviet unions vast russian republic won their 
first battle forcing his opponent to defend his performance as 
premier 
in balloting on procedural issues late wednesday delegates by a 
onevote margin 495494 voted to delay the election of the 
republics president and then voted 551442 to require a report 
from premier alexander v vlasov on the state of the republic 
stanislav yelisiekin a supporter of yeltsin said the move was 
intended to force vlasov into giving an accounting of the 
republics disastrous economic and social problems prior to 
balloting 
russia is the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
stretching from leningrad on the gulf of finland to moscow and on 
through siberia to the pacific ocean it contains 52 percent of the 
soviet unions 290 million people and threequarters of its land 
mass 
many russians feel their wealth is supporting the other 14 
soviet republics and both yeltsin and vlasov have taken up the 
issue of sovereignty in their platforms 
the official soviet news agency tass has said some russian 
lawmakers are demanding independence like the three baltic 
republics and groups in azerbaijan georgia and the ukraine 
vlasov is supported by mikhail s gorbachev against yeltsin the 
soviet presidents most popular rival who contends the soviet 
leadership has made only halfhearted efforts to solve the 
countrys problems 
gorbachev underscored the importance of the struggle by 
appearing on the balcony as an observer for the second day today to 
watch the parliament struggle slowly through largely procedural 
matters 
the radicals are hoping to wrest control of the republics 
affairs from the national government some are calling for russian 
laws to take priority over national laws and a few are even going 
so far as to demand that russia to secede from the soviet union 
the first stage of the struggle is the election of the 
parliaments chairman or president 
with gorbachev watching the deputies voted 650243 to elect 
their president immediately after vlasovs speech without 
discussing any of the candidates 
there was no immediate word on when vlasov would speak or when 
the election would be held 
there are three lesserknown possible contenders for the job of 
the russian presidency yuri manayenkov a national communist party 
secretary ivan polozhkov a hardline conservative opponent of 
marketoriented reforms and arkady volsky who from more than a 
year was the head of the committee trying to keep order in 
nagornokarabakh region between armenians and azerbaijanis

arizona has a new martin luther king holiday on 
the books but the 15year struggle that cost the state millions in 
lost convention business isnt over yet 
opponents of the holiday said their campaign to put the issue 
before the voters would begin today one day after gov rose 
mofford signed a bill designating the third monday in january as a 
paid holiday in kings memory for state employees 
mrs mofford cut short a trip to tucson to fly back to phoenix 
and sign the bill hours after it won final passage in the house 
this is a great day for arizona an especially great day for 
governor mofford because my wish has come true mrs mofford said 
the house passed the bill 3525 the senate passed it 1614 on 
tuesday 
passage was the culmination of a 15year struggle to designate a 
king holiday 
controversy over it has dogged the states politicians for 
years democratic gov bruce babbit declared a holiday by 
proclamation in 1986 his successor gov evan mecham rescinded it 
days before it would have taken effect 
the ensuing uproar included marches tourist boycotts and 
convention cancellations the furor also fueled a recall drive 
against mecham but he was removed by impeachment on other grounds 
before the recall vote could be held 
opponents say an extra holiday would cost the state 500000 to 
35 million supporters contend conventions and meetings canceled 
over arizonas failure to create a holiday cost the state about 25 
million in 198788 
mrs mofford signed the bill in a conference room packed with 
political religious and business leaders who had campaigned for 
passage she also spoke by speakerphone with coretta scott king 
widow of the civil rights leader 
the people of arizona now have a great opportunity to put 
aside the politics of polarization and use this holiday to promote 
interracial cooperation healing and good will mrs king told 
the governor 
the measure repeals a bill passed in september that created a 
king holiday but eliminated the states paid columbus day holiday 
opponents of the kingforcolumbus law collected enough 
signatures to get the measure placed on the ballot and they said 
they would try to force a referendum on the new law as well 
julian sanders an architect who spearheaded the petition drive 
on the first bill said the new campaign would begin today 
opponents have 90 days to collect the 43350 signatures needed for 
a referendum 
mrs mofford said she was hopeful the referendum drive would 
fail she said arizona needs to put the issue to rest not only 
has it affected the economy but it has hurt us nationally we are 
considered a racist state she said 
during debate on the bill state rep brenda burns a republican 
who had pushed for a public vote said the issue is no longer 
just an issue of whether to support the martin luther king 
holiday 
it has become an issue of whether or not we take away the 
peoples right to vote she said 
rep jim skelly a republican broke with his fellow 
conservatives in opposing a referendum we are elected 
representatives and our job as elected representatives is to pass 
legislation he said 
fortyseven other states have a holiday honoring king the other 
states without official king holidays are montana and new hampshire

reversing its decadesold 
policy of segregated health services the government has declared 
public hospitals open to all races 
the decision wednesday was the latest in a series of reforms 
since president fw de klerk took office in august 
the antiapartheid national medical and dental association 
welcomed the change 
we hope this example will be followed quickly in bringing 
about an end to other obstacles toward a free and democratic south 
africa the group said 
health minister rina venter said the decision was effective 
immediately and that patients staying at overcrowded black 
hospitals now could be moved to underutilized white hospitals 
venter told parliament in cape town that all hospitals must be 
available to all south africans for the countrys health system to 
run effectively 
all hospitals are now accessible to all people in south 
africa venter said in an interview after leaving parliament 
asked if she was worried about the reaction from conservative 
whites venter said no i think integrated hospitals will be 
in the interests of all our people 
schools and neighborhoods now remain the main segregated 
institutions in south africa also the countrys 28 million blacks 
have no voice in national affairs 
de klerk has pledged to dismantle apartheid and wants to 
negotiate a new constitution that will bring blacks into the 
national government however he opposes outright black majority 
rule 
the decision to integrate health services should help alleviate 
overcrowding at many black hospitals 
for example johannesburg general hospital which is for whites 
has an occupancy rate of about 50 percent in contrast hundreds of 
black patients sleep on the floor at baragwanath hospital the only 
hospital in the nearby black township of soweto 
traditionally white hospitals treated blacks in need of 
emergency or specialized care but transferred them to black 
hospitals as soon as it was feasible 
the staff at public hospitals has been integrated for years at 
many private hospitals both patients and staff already are fully 
integrated 
in other developments 
defense minister magnus malan told parliament the military was 
considering integrating some army units 
deputy education minister piet marais said the government was 
considering combining education departments separated along racial 
lines into a single bureaucracy however marais gave no indication 
the government intended to integrate public schools

china today accused the united states of engaging 
in a smear campaign over beijings human rights record and denied 
amnesty internationals charges of widespread violations 
foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua speaking at a weekly 
briefing also said recent student demonstrations in bulgaria the 
soviet union and hong kong in support of prodemocracy students in 
china were inappropriate and based on ignorance 
ms li expressed chinas strong protest over a proclamation 
signed saturday by president bush that named a national day in 
support of human rights the proclamation called on the chinese 
government to respond positively to the aspirations of the 
prodemocracy movement crushed by military force last year 
ms li said we have all along been opposed to interfering in 
chinas domestic affairs and smearing and attacking the chinese 
government by the us congress on the pretext of freedom and human 
rights 
she said china was resentful of the human rights proclamation 
and had expressed such feelings through diplomatic channels 
the spokeswoman also said the report wednesday of the human 
rights group amnesty international chronicling the arrests of 
political activists in last years demonstrations was totally 
unfounded and unreasonable 
she said the arrest and trial of criminals was chinas 
sovereign right and no country or organization had the right to 
interfere in chinas internal affairs 
amnesty international based in london said it sent premier li 
peng a list of 650 names of people arrested since the crackdown on 
the prodemocracy movement in june the group asked for information 
on what had happened to them 
china announced last week that it had released 211 people 
detained for nearly a year in connection with the demonstrations 
it said 431 were still under investigation foreign and chinese 
analysts believe the number still being held without charges or 
trial is in the thousands 
li said the quelling of what the government calls the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion last year has won the 
understanding and support of most other countries 
referring to recent demonstrations in bulgaria soviet union and 
hong kong in support of chinese students she said we can only 
express our regret over the inappropriate actions taken by some 
people in some countries due to ignorance of the truth of the 
tiananmen square incident 
chinas human rights record has been the central issue in its 
deteriorating relations with the united states and other western 
countries since the violent suppression of the democracy movement 
washington says china has made only minimal improvements in 
human rights since then year and some members of congress are 
calling on bush to show us disapproval by ending mostfavored 
nation status on chinese imports 
bush who has until june 3 to make a decision on whether to 
renew chinas favored trading status said wednesday i dont 
want to send a signal that were happy with their chinas human 
rights record it isnt an easy call

was killed today by one of several artillery shells fired during a 
renewed exchange between rival christian forces battling for 
control of their battered enclave 
police said a man was also killed and seven people wounded in 
the bombardment that followed a shortlived ceasefire called at 9 
pm wednesday by the maronite catholic church which claims the 
warring commanders as members 
the girl died when a shell pierced her bedroom in east beiruts 
sin elfil district the wounded included four women in an 
underground shelter in ashrafiyeh the main stronghold of the 
lebanese forces militia 
the latest casualties raised the overall toll to 1031 dead and 
2769 wounded since the battle between troops of rebel gen michel 
aoun and the lebanese forces commander samir geagea broke out 
jan 30 
police said the shelling which engulfed most of the 
310squaremile enclave picked up only two hours after the 
ceasefire plea and continued to rage this morning 
it was the second ceasefire appeal by the church in three days 
dozens of previous truce accords in the 4monthold christian war 
have collapsed

alternated between raging exchanges and sporadic fire 
police said fire engines were battling fires which broke out in 
several apartment buildings and gas stations in the enclave 
covering the clear blue sky with palls of black smoke 
aouns 19000 army troops have failed to overpower geageas 
6000 street fighters who control twothirds of the enclave aoun 
holds the presidential palace in suburban baabda he has refused to 
hand it over to syrianbacked president elias hrawi because he 
contends hrawis election by parliament on nov 24 was 
unconstitutional geagea supports hrawi

an international commission today 
urged nations that oppose the forced repatriation of vietnamese 
boat people to establish and finance refugee centers on their own 
soil 
one delegate said the call was aimed at countries such as the 
united states which has condemned hong kong for sending back 
vietnamese refugees 
thailand and malaysia sponsored the statement which was 
released at the opening session of a conference of the un high 
commissioner for refugees committee on indochinese refugees 
the statement was endorsed by all delegations except the united 
states and norway which expressed reservations conference sources 
said no formal vote was taken because the conference was still 
under way 
us and norwegian representatives felt the statement should 
have accentuated positive developments such as a decrease in the 
numbers leaving vietnam said herman laurel a member of the 
philippine delegation 
this is mostly directed at the us and vietnam he said 
adding that asian nations took the initiative out of their 
frustration on the continuing problem of indochinese who leave 
for economic and not political reasons 
on wednesday the british government announced it had suggested 
that the united states take 9000 vietnamese boat people from hong 
kong and house them in a special camp possibly on the american 
island of guam 
in manila us delegates refused to comment on the issue until 
the conference ends friday 
meanwhile three boats carrying 222 cambodians trying to reach 
australia reached indonesia bringing to more than 400 the number 
of cambodian boat people landing there in the last two weeks a 
navy officer said today 
in the statement socalled countries of temporary refuge 
those where boat people land first urged vietnam to take effective 
measures to prevent its people from leaving their homeland 
illegally 
the statement said the repatriation of those not considered 
political refugees was needed to prevent asian nations from being 
flooded with indochinese who do not qualify for settlement in the 
united states or other third countries 
there is an obligation on any country which opposes the 
repatriation of nonrefugees who do not volunteer to return home 
to offer an effective intermediate solution such as the setting up 
and financing on its own territory a regional holding center for 
all nonrefugees the statement said 
it said that if no workable intermediate solution can be agreed 
upon temporary refuge countries must reserve the right to take 
such unilateral action as they deem necessary to safeguard their 
national interests 
vietnam expressed reservations about accepting people who dont 
want to return 
the 10 asian countries participating were thailand malaysia 
china brunei singapore japan south korea philippines vietnam 
and indonesia others included united states britain soviet 
union australia austria belgium canada denmark finland

president corazon aquino today 
suggested the united states could provide medical and other 
supplies to defer the 222 million that manila claims washington 
owes for use of its six military bases 
us and philippine negotiators agreed to extend their talks 
into tonight after a fourth day of meetings on whether to extend 
the bases when their lease expires in september 1991 
we are trying to hammer out differences said philippine 
spokesman rafael alunan i believe that they are inching toward 
some sort of agreement on the debt issue 
the alleged debt has emerged as a major stumbling block in the 
talks 
philippine delegates claim the united states had fallen behind 
by 2226 million in aid promised in return for use of the bases 
us officials say washington fell only 96 million short of its 
aid target 
we have not conceded that there is a shortfall stanley 
schrager spokesman for the us panel said today we have lived 
up to our commitment and we have made our best effort 
the chief us delegate richard armitage was quoted wednesday 
as saying he would not stand next to a cash register while 
trying to settle the question president bush said he would study 
alternative locations for the bases if the negotiations fail 
the two sides also disagree on the termination date for the 1947 
agreement on the bases in 1966 the two governments shortened the 
lease period and agreed that either party could terminate the bases 
after 25 years with one years notice 
the philippine panel maintains that its constitution drafted by 
a committee appointed by mrs aquino bans foreign bases as of 
september 1991 unless a new treaty has been ratified the united 
states says the bases should be allowed to remain for a year after 
that even if there is no new agreement 
schrager said the delegations agreed to talk all night if need 
be 
were still talking and will probably spend the rest of 
the night to come out with an arrangement he said armitage 
planned to leave the philippines on friday but was to return if 
both sides decide to continue the talks 
some us and philippine officials have suggested the aid 
shortfall could be made up by delivering excess military equipment 
from american units in western europe 
perhaps these medical facilities could be included in our 
talks with the us panel on the matter of the shortfall mrs 
aquino said during a speech at a veterans center today mrs aquino 
also said it was too early to say whether the panels had reached an 
impasse 
a classified memorandum prepared in february by the american 
desk of the department of foreign affairs said the us congress 
was reluctant to increase aid to the philippines because of 
perceived weak leadership and mismanagement by the aquino 
government 
the memo a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
suggested that the government publicly demand full us funding for 
the bases as well as other aid programs 
but the memo recommended manila quietly lobby the united states 
to make up the shortfall for the bases on the private understanding 
that the philippines would accept a lower figure in aid under the 
international aid program inaugurated last year 
any agreement on the bases would need the approval of the 
philippine senate where opposition is running high 
the current talks are considered exploratory to determine 
whether the two governments will begin formal negotiations on a new 
agreement 
the two sides could also decide to proceed to formal 
negotiations or simply end the talks and begin deliberations on a 
schedule for closing the installations officials added

a human rights report today urged international 
protection of arab children and said 159 were killed by bullets 
beatings and tear gas and up to 63000 injured during the first two 
years of the palestinian uprising 
the study sponsored by the swedish save the children group 
claimed that israels army practiced calculated cruelty in some 
cases 
the findings were rejected by the office of brig gen nachman 
shai the army spokesman and criticized by israeli human rights 
activists as onesided 
in another development the world health organizations annual 
assembly today adopted a resolution that cited worsening health 
conditions of the arab population in the israelioccupied 
territories 
the vote in geneva was 1052 with only the united states and 
israel voting against five countries abstained and another 55 
nations were absent 
the resolution cosponsored by 36 nations expresses concern at 
the deterioration of health conditions and at israelis refusal 
to permit who experts to investigate the health situation in the 
territories 
israel said the health situation in the occupied territories had 
improved 
responding to the allegations by the swedish group an army 
spokesman maj moshe fogel said proplo activists used children 
as shields during protests and were responsible for their injuries 
we are faced with an uprising which turns its children into 
martyrs and actually encourages minors to participate in violent 
activities against israeli soldiers whether actively or 
passively he said 
thomas hammarberg head of the swedish group and a former 
secretarygeneral of amnesty international said israeli leaders 
failed to investigate abuses adequately and gave soldiers the 
impression they could do as they liked 
it could be the soldiers believe plastic and rubbercoated 
bullets are nonlethal he said in an interview but i think it 
begins to take the form of the intentional if they let it continue 
when they know the consequences 
the report examined how children 16 and under suffered physical 
injuries and the effects of collective punishments such as school 
closures curfews house demolitions raids and economic sanctions 
it concluded in view of the palestinian communitys 
difficulty in protecting its children and the inadequacy of 
safeguards dependent upon israeli government enforcement 
protection of palestinian children becomes an urgent matter in 
need of immediate consideration by the international community 
the report said 159 children aged 16 and under were killed in 
the first two years of the uprising against israeli rule of the 
occupied lands the uprising began in december 1987 the report 
said 106 of the 159 children were fatally shot so far this year 
13 children have been shot to death the report said 
the army says 79 children under the age of 14 were fatally 
wounded in the last 29 months it does not have a figure for 
victims 16 and under 
the israeli information center for human rights in the occupied 
territories says 148 children 16 and under had died through may 1 
spokeswoman zahava galon said tear gas deaths were excluded as too 
difficult to substantiate and that no reliable injury estimates 
were available 
the army disputed the reports claim that the vast majority 
of soldiers were not punished for wrongdoing fogel said soldiers 
were courtmartialed or disciplined for improper use of force in 25 
percent of the fatality cases of children recorded by the army 
he said army investigations were hampered because palestinians 
often take bodies before autopsies can be performed and arab 
witnesses refuse to cooperate with army investigators 
the threevolume 1008paged study was written by anne 
elizabeth nixon former deputy director of the american save the 
children program in israel it was funded by a ford foundation 
grant 
joshua schoffman an israeli civil rights lawyer said the study 
had serious flaws because it relied too heavily on palestinian 
sources 
just as one has to treat army announcements with skepticism 
you have to treat palestinian testimony with skepticism and balance 
the two he said 
among the findings 
52 percent of the children killed were not in the vicinity of a 
protest when they were fatally injured 
children accounted for 21 percent of all deaths and 38 percent 
of all injuries and deaths combined by ap count 687 palestinians 
have been killed along with 43 israelis 
the average age of children killed was 10 years 
about one in every 15 to 20 children in the occupied lands was 
injured totalling 50000 to 63000

mexican police accepted payoffs from drug 
barons delivered narcotics and provided arms to protect marijuana 
ranches a prosecution witness said in a trial resulting from a 
us drug agents murder 
juan fernandez testified in us district court wednesday that 
in 1984 he helped manage marijuana ranches for mexican drug lord 
rafael caro quintero and hnded out bribes to officials from four 
mexican law enforcement agencies 
fernandez was the first government witness to testify in the 
trial of four men charged with conspiracy in the 1985 torture and 
killing of us drug enforcement administration agent enrique 
kiki camarena 
the defendants are juan ramon matta ballesteros a convicted 
honduran drug kingpin ruben zuno arce a brotherinlaw of former 
mexican president luis echeverria juan bernabe ramirez a former 
mexican policeman and javier vasquez velasco accused of killing 
two us tourists who were mistaken for dea agents 
prosecutors allege that camarena was killed in retaliation for 
raids on marijuana fields that cost caro quintero and other drug 
barons 5 billion 
speaking in spanish fernandez said he had been paid more than 
200000 as a dea informant over the past nine years and helped the 
agency on more than 80 investigations 
he said he helped camarena make an undercover heroin purchase 
from a caro quintero associate manuel chavez and that camarena 
had instructed him to take a job helping run the ranches 
fernandez said the guadalajara drug cartel led by caro quintero 
maintained about 40 marijuana ranches in zacatecas state the 
cartel employed up to 500 workers who lived in the fields under 
armed guard fernandez said 
chavez used a radio to keep in touch with mexican federal state 
and local police officials fernandez said 
chavez would make payoffs on a particular day the end of 
the month fernandez testified 
information obtained by camarena led to the seizure of more than 
10 tons of marijuana during raids on the ranches in may 1985 us 
officials contend 
testimony at the 1988 trial of three other men in the case

the palestine liberation organization is 
consolidating its military forces throughout the middle east under 
a new strategy to upgrade its combat potential according to plo 
officials and newspaper reports today 
the kuwaiti daily alanbaa quoted plo leader yasser arafat as 
saying that israel was planning a largescale attack on neighboring 
arab states in autumn or the following spring 
arafat warned that israel intended to occupy the jordanian 
mountains from salt to karak on the advice of former defense 
minister ariel sharon now trade minister the newspaper said 
the newspaper quoted arafat as saying that sharon recommended 
proceeding to the outskirts of amman jordan to impose its 
conditions on jordan 
newspaper reports did not specify that the plo was gearing up 
for war 
bassem abu sharif an aide to arafat was quoted by alanbaa as 
stressing that the military realignment was a strategic choice 
alanbaa quoted palestinian sources in tunis as saying the plo 
leadership recently met in the iraqi capital baghdad and adopted 
a new palestinian military strategy that provides for 
gathering all palestinian forces to enable them to restore their 
combat abilities 
it said that under the new plan all palestinian forces have been 
shifted to two arab countries iraq and libya from algeria sudan 
and the two yemeni states where the palestinian guerrillas fled 
from lebanon 
the transfer was in line with the tasks to be assigned to these 
forces in the coming stage the newspaper said 
plo military strength has usually been scattered in arab 
countries particularly since 8000 plo fighters were forced out of 
beirut by the 1982 israeli invasion of the lebanese capital a year 
later 3000 more fled the northern lebanese town of tripoli under 
syrian pressure 
senior plo figures say they have returned with the 
organizations strength in lebanon estimated at more than 11000 
fighters 
lebanon used to be a favored base for the plo which launched 
military operations against israel starting in 1965 from 
neighboring arab countries jordan egypt and syria all cracked 
down on their operations leaving only lebanon

president mikhail s gorbachev said today that a 
conservative soviet public afraid of change is holding back his 
efforts at economic and political reform 
changing peoples minds is the most difficult thing 
perestroika depends on public opinion and its conservative he 
said 
gorbachev previously has blamed bureaucrats for bogging down 
perestroika his program of restructuring soviet society this is 
the first time he has said the people might be at fault 
in politics the public doesnt accept pluralism and it has 
complexes about ideological conceptions and cliches gorbachev 
told a crowd of reporters in a break at the russian congress 
many hardliners are unhappy with gorbachevs recent moves to 
end the communist partys monopoly on power legalize private 
ownership of factories and otherwise upset basic laws of marxism 
in economics they say you must not touch this and you must 
not touch that gorbachev said 
turning to premier nikolai ryzhkov who gave a television 
interview last week on economic reform proposals gorbachev 
commented ryzhkov only said a few words and already there is 
great agitation in the country 
take any sphere everywhere we are hindered by complexes 
the soviet leader said 
faced with public alarm gorbachev has repeatedly delayed a 
radical economic reform plan over the last two months 
he backed off suggestions by his aides that he was planning 
polishstyle shock therapy which brought sudden price rises 
and mass unemployment in that country in hope of shortening the 
difficult period of transition from oldstyle communism to a market 
economy 
instead gorbachev has promised the public that nothing would be 
decided without discussion he also indicated that his presentation 
of the program to the national parliament will be delayed again as 
he will not discuss it with his own presidential council of 
advisors until may 22 
gorbachev also used the brief encounter with reporters to 
reassure the soviet populace that the country can handle the 
current intense political struggle and its economic crisis which 
has left stores near empty 
people are saying chaos chaos collapse collapse when 
lenin watched a similar revolutionary process he said you know 
this chaos will crystallize a new form of life 
the soviet leader was looking relaxed and healthy after a day 
and a half of watching the congress of the russian republic wrangle 
over its agenda newly elected radicals are trying to elect a 
gorbachev rival boris yeltsin as president of russia and to 
wrest control of the republics affairs away from the national 
government russia is the largest of 15 republics in the soviet 
union with 52 percent of its people and threequarters of its land 
mass 
gorbachev who stands to lose considerable prestige if his 
candidate russian premier alexander vlasov is defeated by 
yeltsin was offhand when asked about the struggle 
i see no drama in this he said this is all normal the 
communist party has given up its monopoly 
tomorrow or the next day new parties will appear with their 
own platforms and proposals and this will be a normal process 
he also condemned the soviet tradition of governmentowned 
monopolies which have been blamed for part of the nations 
economic stagnation 
he even joked about it 
we fought against the capitalist monopoly for 70 years but 
the strongest monopoly is our own he said right here we have 
the representative of our former monopoly uralmash he said 
gesturing at ryzhkov the premier previously served as director of 
the giant uralmash factory which makes earthmovers and other 
heavyduty equipment 
but when foreign correspondents pressed him on the crisis in the 
baltics where estonia latvia and lithuania are all demanding 
independence from the soviet union he abruptly shut down the 
interview 
asked if he would meet with representatives of the baltic he 
looked the correspondent in the eye and then turned away telling 
his guards lets move on 
another correspondent then asked if he would meet with 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene who was en route to 
moscow this afternoon with a compromise proposal to put to 
gorbachev he said i have received no such request and moved 
away

freed american hostage robert polhill 
underwent surgery today to remove his voice box because of a 
cancerous growth around his vocal cords 
ben smith spokesman for walter reed medical center said the 
midmorning operation was expected to take about four hours 
polhills doctors said wednesday that such radical surgery might 
have been avoided if the tumor had been diagnosed sooner 
if it had been discovered earlier he probably wouldnt have 
to lose his voice box provided he had the right radiation 
therapy said col russ zajtchuk deputy commander of clinical 
services at the army hospital 
he said the tumor is probably at least a year old but that 
there is no evidence the cancer has spread nonetheless polhills 
treatment will include radiation therapy the doctor said 
polhill 55 was held captive by shiite moslems in lebanon for 
39 months before being released april 22 
we are going to overcome this ordeal we are survivors and we 
are definitely going to survive this ordeal ferial polhill said 
at the news conference which her husband did not attend 
polhill has told his doctors he was visited by physicians eight 
or 10 times during his captivity 
im pretty sure they didnt examine his throat zajtchuk 
said 
hes a smoker and this condition is related to smoking 
zajtchuk said adding that polhill told him his captors had kept 
him in cigarettes 
the growth is involving both vocal cords one vocal cord the 
left is paralyzed zajtchuk said the tumor also extends below 
the vocal cords so it is quite an extensive lesion 
polhills weak raspy voice prompted early discovery of the 
tumor a full diagnosis was put off until polhill a diabetic who 
was 25 pounds underweight when he was released gained enough 
stamina to undergo the general anesthesia necessary for a biopsy 
polhill was told after the biopsy last week that the growth was 
cancerous and agreed to surgery public disclosure was postponed 
to give polhill time to tell members of his family zajtchuk said 
mrs polhill said her husbands spirits were very high very 
positive strong polhills mother ruth nodded agreement 
zajtchuk said polhill had begun working with a speech therapist 
to explore various methods for voice communication once the larynx 
is removed 
one common method involves the use of an electronic device that 
emulates the voice box another technique involves swallowing air 
and regurgitating it in a way that forms words 
a third possibility one not favored for radiation patients 
requires a tracheotomy the insertion of a breathing tube in the 
throat 
his mental status is remarkable zajtchuk said imagine a 
fellow being locked up for 3 years and then he comes to walter 
reed and he virtually gets locked up again and then he cant 
communicate because hes going to lose his voice box 
polhill is expected to spend about two weeks in the hospital 
after the surgery then will undergo radiation treatments

the four major television networks say they 
will keep boycotting some white house events if president bushs 
press secretary continues limiting the number of cameras 
the networks bypassed two of bushs meetings wednesday to 
protest marlin fitzwaters experiment with limiting coverage of 
certain events to two pool cameras 
cbs news bureau chief barbara cohen who chairs the networks 
own pool of bureau chiefs said we have all decided that if they 
continue to call for a travel pool for these events we will 
continue to not come 
she and the bureau chiefs at nbc abc and cnn were demanding a 
meeting with fitzwater to discuss the coverage rules 
the white house did not attempt to limit the number of cameras 
at any of todays events including bushs planned oval office 
meeting with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
radio networks in a gesture of sympathy also declined to send 
in a reporter to cover two bush meetings wednesday dealing with 
civil rights 
they dont have to cover us if they dont want to fitzwater 
said in an interview all were doing is experimenting 
fitzwater said he wanted to reduce the crush of camera crews 
inside the oval office and other corners of the executive mansion 
at limited coverage events 
all the networks covered the presidents news conference on 
wednesday 
the white house earlier in the week twice limited coverage of 
presidential meetings including the opening of tuesdays budget 
summit with congressional leaders a single network sent in two 
cameras to videotape the events and shared the tape afterward with 
competitors 
its not our fault that there are more independents sending 
camera crews in said cohen we are competitors and we dont 
want to have our product homogenized by having one camera crew at 
all these events 
abc bureau chief george watson said if its a question of 
congestion and decorum thats something we can talk about 
he said the networks might be open to restricting coverage to 
two cameras in exchange for letting each network send in its own 
correspondent to ask questions currently only one broadcast 
correspondent is in such pool coverage

five lawyers suing a county judge in 
federal court argue that his practice of opening sessions with a 
prayer forces his religious beliefs on a captive audience 
for a year mecklenburg county district judge bill constangy has 
recited a 67word prayer he composed himself before he hears 
traffic and other lower court cases 
a lot of people think the courts are involved in a lot of 
tricks and games constangy testified wednesday the prayer 
sets the proper tone its not done as a religious exercise 
its done for a secular purpose 
the north carolina civil liberties union and five charlotte 
lawyers are suing to bar the prayer under the us constitutions 
separation of church and state 
this is an official prayer said george daly attorney for 
the plaintiffs it was composed by an official read in an 
official setting on company time 
after hearing several hours of testimony us district court 
judge james mcmillan said he would not rule before june 4 he gave 
attorneys on both sides until then to submit additional evidence 
constangy a 47yearold charlotte native who attends a roman 
catholic church was defended by the state attorney generals 
office as well as attorneys from a greensboro law firm and the 
rutherford institute in charlottesville va 
the institute is a nonprofit legal and educational organization 
that specializes in litigation involving churchandstate 
constitutional issues according to its executive director michael 
patrick 
one of the judges attorneys james t williams jr compared 
the prayer with those invoked before congress and the inscription 
in god we trust on us currency 
theres no difference on earth between the us congress 
opening its sessions with a prayer and this man opening court with 
a prayer williams said 
but public defender kathleen arundell doesnt see it that way 
the judge should avoid the appearance of impropriety she 
testified the people in the courtroom feel he has made a 
religious statement and he isnt impartial 
constangy recites this prayer o lord our god our father in 
heaven we pray this morning that you will place your divine 
guiding hand on this courtroom and that with your mighty 
outstretched arm you will protect the innocent give justice to 
those who have been harmed and mercy to us all 
let truth be heard and wisdom be reflected in the light of 
your presence here with us today amen

stamable quebec ap a fire raged out of control in quebecs 
largest tire dump today spewing coalblack smoke and the mayor of 
a nearby town said residents might have to be evacuated 
the flames jumped a firebreak late wednesday and quickly spread 
to almost all 3 million tires in the dump which is the size of 
seven football fields 
officials said it was not immediately clear what caused the 
blaze located about 1 mile outside stamable a town of 5000 
people and about 50 miles from the us border billowing clouds 
of smoke drifted over nearby farm fields 
the smoke funneled high and drifted northwest away from 
stamable where citizens for years have asked that the tires be 
moved or at least better protected 
but officials said a change in winds could blow smoke toward the 
town today they told residents that while tests for toxic 
elements in the air so far turned up negative an evacuation plan 
was ready 
we are going to watch the toxicity of air and if it goes high 
we will evacuate said jacques doyon the mayor of stamable 
the smoke was clearly visible over montreal 13 miles away 
the fire which began wednesday afternoon jumped a firebreak 
and raced to the end of the dump where firefighters from a half 
dozen towns in the region held the flames at a 50yard trench dug 
with heavy equipment 
doyon on wednesday said fire crews were powerless to fight 
the blaze until the flames became less intense 
early today a steady rain began to fall on the blazing tires 
doyon said fire crews started dumping dirt on the lower end of the 
tire pile in an attempt to snuff the flames 
smoke from burning tires is known to pose a health danger and 
can spoil crops the burning tires also leave an oily residue that 
can contaminate underground and surface water 
last month a fire at a dump in steannedesplaines 35 miles 
north of montreal was brought under control after 50000 tires 
burned over 24 hours 
hagersville made headlines in february when arsonists started a 
fire at a dump holding 14 million tires the fire which burned for 
17 days was the largest tire blaze in north american history 
the quebec government said in march it would spend 35 million 
to increase security and put up fences at the provinces seven 
largest tire dump sites

juan bosch a leftist 
expresident once ousted in a military coup took an early lead 
over conservative president joaquin balaguer in dominican 
elections according to initial returns today 
bosch who has moderated his positions in promising to lead the 
nation out of an economic crisis held a narrow lead with about 20 
percent of the polling stations reporting the electoral board said 
this morning 
at the headquarters of boschs dominican liberation party 
boschs backers were celebrating early today 
lideo cadet the partys secretarygeneral excitedly told 
reporters at dawn weve won the elections but he was not 
authorized to make a formal claim of victory on boschs behalf 
cadet said bosch was being kept informed about wednesdays 
election by the party leadership but would not comment yet 
neither balaguer nor his party leaders commented publicly on the 
returns aides said balaguer planned to keep to his usual schedule 
at his palace office 
votecounting was being done by hand and was running far behind 
schedule 
balaguer 83 and blind from glaucoma and bosch 80 were locked 
in their fifth contest for the leadership of this caribbean nation 
of 7 million people 
with 1364 of the 6663 polling stations reporting bosch had 
126443 votes to balaguers 114806 election officials said a 
former socialist mayor of santo domingo jose francisco pena gomez 
was third with 80816 votes and centerleft candidate jacobo 
majluta had 22559 votes officials said 
bosch and the army hierarchy have been at odds since he was 
overthrown in a military coup 27 years ago but military officers 
and balaguer stated before the elections they would respect the 
outcome of the vote 
about 30 international observers monitored the voting including 
former president jimmy carter he told reporters that talks with 
the four major candidates after the polls closed had convinced him 
the final results would be respected by all 
santo domingo was quiet this morning with no military patrols 
visible public and private offices and commercial establishments 
customariliy remain closed and dominicans stay home from work the 
day after national elections although it is not an official 
holiday 
the election board remained in control of the nations public 
and private radio and television stations allowing only the 
broadcast of official election information 
about 32 million people were registered to vote but the 
officials did not announce the turnout or say what percentage of 
the vote had been counted 
bosch an author and intellectual who describes himself as a 
marxist but not a communist ran on a moderate platform he pledged 
to work for good relations with the united states and endorsed 
capitalism as the best way to improve his countrys economic plight 
balaguer founder and leader of the social christian reformist 
party pinned his hopes largely on a 2 billion publicworks 
project to transform centuriesold santo domingo he portrayed 
bosch as a dangerous marxist 
balaguers publicworks project has created thousands of new 
jobs but his popularity has slumped as the countrys economic 
problems deepened dominicans have contended with chronic 
electricity blackouts and water shortages 
bosch had been leading in opinion polls by 10 points but some 
observers believe he may be hurt by his criticism last week of a 
1954 agreement with the vatican providing all army chaplains be 
roman catholic this nation which shares the island of hispaniola 
with haiti is overwhelmingly catholic

a judge has ruled that all businesses can 
open on sundays in north dakota but has retained a list of 44 
items that still cannot be sold on the sabbath including clothing 
and hardware 
the law which also lists 37 types of businesses that may open 
sundays including cold storage warehouses libraries bait shops 
and coinoperated laundries was called arbitrary haphazard and 
irrational by the judge 
north dakota malls though wont be opening for business sunday 
south central district judge gerald glaser temporarily blocked 
his own ruling from taking effect anticipating an appeal that 
attorney general nicholas spaeth later said he would pursue 
the decision came wednesday in a lawsuit filed by a group of 
north dakota businesses seeking to overturn the states sunday 
closing law which is recognized as the nations strictest 
the businesses backed by the state chamber of commerce contend 
the law is vague unconstitutional and selectively enforced 
glasers decision which handed small victories to both spaeth 
and north dakota shopkeepers in the dispute surprised the attorney 
general 
glaser has staked out a middle ground and i dont think 
either side expected it spaeth said wednesday 
glaser said the law was discriminatory as well as arbitrary 
haphazard and irrational 
but its flaws did not warrant throwing it out entirely the 
judge said 
glasers ruling in essence does away with the list of 
businesses that may open allowing any retailer to open on sunday 
as long as the retailer does not sell the 44 prohibited items 
john olson a bismarck attorney for the business group said the 
ruling further erodes sunday closing restrictions in north 
dakota theres no doubt about that 
it will probably increase retail business on sunday olson 
said but the opinion does not have the effect of going the whole 
nine yards and creating sunday opening in this state 
a large discount retailer could open on sunday if it limited 
itself to selling shampoo toothpaste and other items not 
specifically barred from sunday sale 
however the store could not sell clothing except for work 
gloves and baby supplies or kitchenware radios clocks or linens 
in fargo merchants at north dakotss largest shopping mall said 
they were disappointed and somewhat confused 
i wasnt expecting to completely do away with the law but i 
was hoping wed take a bigger bite out of it said mark sinner 
owner of creative kitchen in the west acres mall 
creative kitchen sells kitchenware and kitchen utensils two of 
the 44 items barred for sunday sale 
i think its idiotic said donna haroldson of fargo who was 
shopping with a friend i guess north dakota always feels sunday 
is a day of rest i think thats dumb in this day and age

east german transportation workers briefly 
halted train traffic nationwide today to demand higher wages and 
job protection the latest strikes in a wave of worker unrest 
the 30minute strikes paralyzed main rail routes employees 
stopped work at switching yards train stations and ticket offices 
the east german government news service adn said 
workers staged the warning strikes to protest what they called 
the failure of transportation officials and the government railroad 
company to meet their demands 
train traffic a principal form of daily transportation for many 
east germans was interrupted in the cities of magdeburg rostock 
gera schwerin and others adn said 
at the main station in rostock workers demonstrated against 
the delay tactics of the traffic ministry adn said 
transportation and railroad officials rejected a wage demand on 
wednesday the news service said 
the strikes were the latest among several worker demonstrations 
in recent weeks as frustration grows over the possible effects on 
jobs of unification with west germany 
the two nations are to combine their economies on july 2 when 
the west german mark is to become the currency of east germany 
workers are seeking protection from joblessness and from the 
bettermade western imports already flooding the country many 
outmoded east german businesses are expected to fail in the first 
two years of economic unification 
they also are demanding higher wages to cope with the price 
increases expected when communist price controls are lifted and 
costs are set by the free market 
the strikes were held during the weekly session of parliament 
which debated the draft of a constitution that will allow east 
germany to unite with its western neighbor 
the draft of the democratic charter would eliminate the 
guarantees of full unemployment under the old socialist system 
toppled by a peaceful revolt last year 
leftleaning social democrats say east germans should have some 
job and social guarantees during a transition period to the free 
market 
conservatives say the increase in western investment will 
eventually raise living standards and provide jobs

nielsen estimates showed thursday 
abcs good morning america remained first in ratings 
averaging a 48 today averaged a 32 and cbs this morning 
a 26 each ratings point represents 921000 homes 
the 19th week of bad news for today came a day after it was 
twitted on local tv by wnywtvs good day new york show which 
last week beat the slumping nbc show in local nielsen ratings 
the needling occurred wednesday on the east river where 
today was broadcasting live from a 160foot luxury yacht 
gordon elliott who normally barges into homes for live 
interviews on good day dogged the today broadcast in a 
rented cabin cruiser 
nbc was not amused said the puckish elliott whom viewers saw 
using a bullhorn to hail nbcs show ask permission to board what 
he called the ss today and interview cohosts bryant gumbel

nbc though the coast guard formally asked us to stay 100 
yards from their vessel which i thought was bad sportsmanship 
he groused i was going to make our show available to help them 
in the ratings

at one time also had ratings problems it happens to every

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
today predicted a cooling of the radical revolution that swept iran 
more than 11 years ago and said his people will care more about 
the economy tehran radio reported 
as the revolutionary conditions of the country are normalized 
societys political sensitivity will decrease and attraction to 
welfare and material issues will increase he said according to 
the radio monitored in cyprus 
speaking to provincial officials in tehran he told them to 
move according to the conditions of the time and create an 
economicpolitical balance in society in accordance with the 
governments precise programs 
rafsanjani is trying to pull iran out of the economic mess left 
by the chaotic 1979 revolution and a devastating eightyear war 
with iraq sources in tehran report growing public dissatisfaction 
with the economy 
iranians daily must contend with shortages of almost all 
consumer goods runaway inflation and an artificially inflated 
currency that is all but worthless abroad 
since his election in july rafsanjani has tried to repair 
irans pariah international image by tempering the revolutionary 
hostility toward the west from where he hopes to attract 
investment and advanced technology 
as a result he has been under attack by a rival antiwestern 
radical camp led by former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
and ahmad khomeini son of the late revolutionary patriarch 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the radicals fear relations with the west would compromise the 
neither east nor west principle laid down by khomeini to 
preserve irans neutrality visavis the superpowers and spell the 
end of the revolution 
ahmad who holds no official position in the government but 
wields considerable influence as the late khomeinis only surviving 
son on wednesday urged the government to clarify its policy toward 
the west 
he referred to the existence of two trends of thought in the 
country and said this confused the population 
in an apparent attack on rafsanjanis administration for what 
the radicals see as compromises with the west khomeini said the 
point of compromise or no compromise must be defined 
rafsanjanis rivals have accused him of giving in to the west by 
gaining the release of two american hostages last month from their 
proiranian captors they also are unhappy that iran settled a 
financial dispute in which americans who lost property in iran 
after the revolution would be compensated 
ninety liberal iranians who were instrumental in the revolution 
that toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi and paved the way for the 
islamic republic have reportedly written to rafsanjani demanding 
the restoration of constitutional rights and condemning the 
government for trampling civil liberties 
the letter signed among others by mehdi bazargan the 
nowestranged leader who became the islamic republics first prime 
minister in 1979 reportedly has accused the government of 
mismanaging the economy and isolating iran internationally 
the letter was obtained by the british broadcasting corp in 
london 
what you have produced for the poor are slogans and empty 
stomachs the letter said 
without referring to the letter rafsanjani said today that 
the liberals and other groups opposing the government were 
politically bankrupt

the adult daughters of a child abuse expert were 
awarded 12 million each from a jury that found the former fbi 
agent and prosecutor had sexually abused and beaten them when they 
were growing up 
susan hammond 44 and her sister sharon simone 45 called 
their lawsuit a terrible act of love to make edward rodgers 
72 accountable for years of abuse 
i feel really good that ive gone public with this hammond 
said after the verdict wednesday 
my father did shameful and horrible things to me and my 
brothers and sisters i dont believe he is a shameful and horrible 
man but he has to be held accountable 
the women sued their father a former fbi agent chief 
investigator for the el paso county colo district attorneys 
office and a nationally known child abuse expert for abuses 
suffered from 1944 through 1965 
rodgers cannot be criminally charged because the statute of 
limitations in colorado for sexual assault on children is 10 years 
the limit for a civil lawsuit is two years but jurors determined 
that the sisters became aware of the nature and extent of their 
injury only within the past two years during therapy 
neither rodgers nor his attorney was present during the trial 
and the proceedings were conducted by the sisters female lawyers 
before an allfemale jury picked by the womens attorneys 
in a deposition rodgers admitted that he hit his wife and may 
have hit his children but said he didnt remember doing so he 
said he had fought alcoholism for years 
he described himself as a domineering person who demanded 
strict obedience from my children im sure that i was harsh 
with them but i dont know that it rose to the level of criminal 
abuse he said 
the lawsuit deeply divided the rodgers family two other 
daughters testified on their sisters behalf but their three 
brothers questioned the degree of abuse suffered by their sisters 
rodgers recently fired his attorney thomas d gresham who said 
this week that he has been unable to locate his client since april 
24 
the jury awarded each sister 600000 for economic and 
noneconomic damages and 600000 for punitive damages simone of 
boston and hammond of southern california say they are unable to 
have intimate sexual relationships with their husbands 
the other sisters did not take part in the lawsuit 
hammond testified that her mother sent her to a catholic school 
because she feared rodgers might kill her and that rodgers raped 
her when she returned home from the school at age 19 
simone testified that she was often spared beatings because she 
made a constant effort to please him

prosandinista strikers ended a 
walkout today that had crippled the new proamerican government 
but the countrys cash crisis deepened while washington officials 
haggled over an aid package 
under the settlement signed wednesday night public employees 
salaries are doubled and the government promises not to fire those 
who walked off the job 
government buildings occupied for a week were vacated by morning 
and the countrys estimated 150000 government employees employees 
were returning to work normally the bus system was returning to 
normal but slowly and long lines formed at bus stops 
the international airport closed since tuesday reopened 
the agreement was a victory for the sandinista unions which 
virtually shut down managua and much of this central american 
nation of 35 million residents since the walkout began friday 
it was also a victory for the leftist sandinista front which 
president violeta barrios de chamorros 3weekold government 
accused of a behindthescenes role in the strike 
we hope this experience will serve the government of senora 
violeta to think over our demands labor leader lucio jimenez 
told a news conference 
the main achievement of the strike is that the government 
will be able to do nothing without the active participation of the 
workers 
the government which had declared the strike illegal monday and 
threatened massive firings backed off on practically all points in 
contention 
central bank president francisco mayorga said the strike which 
had been stepped up daily since may 10 cost the government 10 
million in lost production and revenues 
that is a loss nicaraguas battered economy could hardly 
withstand especially after president bush on wednesday said he 
could not legally provide 40 million in emergency aid mrs 
chamorro requested 
bush also complained that procedural gridlock in congress 
was holding up a 300 million nicaraguan aid plan for years 
congress funded the contras rebels in their war with the ruling 
sandinistas and much of the nations economic woes stem from the 
fihgting 
mayorga said the government budget had planned for eventual 
raises similar to those granted but that because of the strike 
they had to be granted sooner than planned 
he said his government is counting on the generosity of the 
conference of donors a group of industrialized mostly european 
nations who help thirdworld countries the group is to meet in 
rome june 67 where nicaragua will present a case for aid 
nicaraguan officials say they inherited an economy ravaged by 
years of sandinista rule and us economic sanctions with only 3 
million left in the treasury and an 11 billion foreign debt 
the striking workers initially demanded a 200 percent pay raise 
to keep up with inflation which is galloping along at an estimated 
70 percent a month but they settled for 100 percent after the 
government offered 120 percent 
we did not want to be responsible for hyperinflation 
jimenez said when asked about accepting the lower percentage 
mayorga said the labor unrest represented the loss of two 
valuable weeks in moving nicaragua toward a freemarket economy 
and trying to turn it around mayorga has devaluated the cordoba 
nicaraguas currency twice in the last three weeks something that 
has sent prices for staples soaring 
nicaraguan public workers earn as little as 10 a month and 
salaries of 3040 are very common a secretary can earn 70 a 
month a technician 140 a middlelevel bank administrator 350 
salaries more than 500 a month in the public sector are rare

president chaim herzog today granted prime 
minister yitzhak shamir a 21day extension on his mandate to form a 
new government 
shamir had asked for extra time because of disputes with 
potential partners over the distribution of cabinet posts avi 
pazner a spokesman for shamir said today the previous mandate 
expires on friday 
shamir came to the president and asked for 21 days he got 21 
days said herzogs spokesman giora pordes 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc has tentative 
agreements that would give him a majority in parliament but he has 
been unable to sign pacts with three ultraright parties and three 
orthodox religious factions 
the problem is who gets what cabinet post pazner said 
pazner said the prime minister was optimistic he would be able 
to present a government to the 120member knesset or parliament 
by next week 
under israeli law a legislator entrusted by the president with 
forming a government is initially given three weeks and then may 
ask for an additional three weeks no president has ever rejected a 
request for an extension 
israel has been governed by shamirs 13member transition 
cabinet since march 15 when the leftleaning labor party toppled 
the likudlabor coalition because shamir refused to accept us 
proposals for an israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo 
herzog first asked shimon peres of the centerleft labor party 
to try to form a government but peres failed after five weeks and 
was forced to hand the mandate to shamir on april 26 
at the time likud signed a coalition agreement with a 
fourmember faction headed by yitzhak modai a former finance 
minister the faction had vacillated between the two rival camps 
for weeks 
a second agreement was signed with eliezer mizrahi a defector 
from the agudat israel ultraorthodox party which backs labor 
mizrahis move to likud robbed peres of the majority he needed to 
form a government 
shamir still needs to pin down formal pledges of backing from 
three religious parties and three ultrarightist factions to assure 
himself of a 61seat majority

the charred apollo capsule in which 
three astronauts died 23 years ago will be given to the smithsonian 
institution if museum officials want the spacecraft and agree not 
to display it nasa said today 
were concerned it not turn into a sideshow of any kind 
said john lawrence chief of congressional affairs for nasas 
office of space flight of course the smithsonian doesnt 
operate like that 
remnants of the 1967 apollo fire americas first space tragedy 
were to have been buried without fanfare this month in an 
abandoned missile silo at cape canaveral air force station the 
more than 17600 pounds of material would have been placed on top 
of debris from the nations only other space disaster the 1986 
challenger explosion 
the apollo capsule and investigative material had been stored at 
nasas langley research center in hampton va for 23 years the 
space agency wanted to find a final resting place for it some of 
the items were moved late last month to kennedy space center 
awaiting burial 
smithsonian officials indicated this month they were interested 
in some of the pieces after turning down offers from the national 
aeronautics and space administration late last year and in 1985 
lawrence said 
derek elliott curator for the national air and space museum 
part of the smithsonian has said he is interested in obtaining the 
capsule as a historic artifact not a display item 
thats one reason why wed want it its a historically 
significant artifact said dom pisano a museum curator and 
chairman of the collections committee that will decide the matter 
smithsonian officials have assured nasa a decision will be made 
within the next month 
our clock is ticking were anxious to resolve this one way or 
another lawrence said 
astronauts virgil gus grissom roger b chaffee and edward 
h white ii died jan 27 1967 when fire engulfed the capsule 
during a countdown rehearsal for the first manned apollo mission 
the fire in a cabin filled with 100 percent oxygen was triggered 
by a spark when a broken or bruised wire beneath grissoms couch 
contacted metal

a sixlegged 12foottall walking robot 
designed for nasa to explore rugged terrain on mars and the moon 
took its first steps at carnegie mellon university the school 
announced today 
the body is propelled in a motion similar to crosscountry 
skiing said william l whittaker chief of the project a 
single leg reaches out in front of the others places itself firmly 
on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine forward 
the aluminum robot named the ambler has two sets of stacked 
legs with three legs per stack work began in 1987 and a prototype 
took its first strides recently at the schools field robotics 
center 
the multipleleg array allows the robot to remain level on 
uneven ground the design provides a stable platform for sensors 
scientific equipment and sampletaking tools 
the ambler is one project being evaluated under the planetary 
rover program of the national aeronautics and space administration 
the program is developing robotic and manned technology to explore 
hardtoreach lunar and planetary surfaces 
the intent for the vehicles is for them to be capable of 
operating on their own with just a very general set of 
directions said david b lavery manager of the nasa program 
robots are not susceptible to temperature changes or radiation 
exposure on the long flights required to reach the planets 
whittaker said they can spend protracted time on a mission that 
would be impossible for an astronaut

when the emperor of japan leaves his 
palace in tokyo nothing is left to chance 
determined to eliminate the element of surprise officials in 
this scenic coastal city on the southern island of kyushu have 
slaved for months over preparations for the arrival friday of 
emperor akihito and empress michiko 
officials are particularly nervous because the emperor is to 
meet mayor hitoshi motoshima who was shot in the back by a 
rightist in january the attacker was angry at motoshima for saying 
the late emperor hirohito akihitos father bore some 
responsibility for world war ii 
about 4000 police officers were being mobilized to ensure the 
monarchs safety 
highlighting the emperors fourday stay will be a visit to an 
atomic bomb memorial at peace park and the 41st annual arbor day 
festival on sunday 
the emperor who is to plant a tree and give a short address is 
scheduled to spend less than an hour at the festival but officials 
reportedly are spending 50000 to deodorize a nearby pig farm 
they also are planning to hang a curtain to keep the farm out of 
the royal couples sight and have told media hoping to cover the 
event by helicopter not to create any ruckus that might disturb the 
animals 
sure if the wind is right it could smell pretty bad at the 
festival said yoichi tanaka head of general affairs for the 
nagasaki prefectural trade union but its a pig farm after all 
and there really isnt any need to try to hide that 
the strengthened police presence prompted a local newspaper the 
nagasaki shimbun to complain in an editorial thursday that 
excessive security could dampen the nagasaki peoples natural 
desire to welcome their emperor 
the editorial however acknowledged the need for tight security 
wherever the emperor goes leftist radicals strongly oppose the 
monarchy and often have used violence to gain publicity for their 
views 
the same month that motoshima was shot leftists claimed 
responsibility for firing projectiles that slightly damaged the 
tokyo home of the emperors younger brother prince hitachi 
public opinion polls indicate the overwhelming majority of 
japanese support the monarchy but there also are painful memories 
of world war ii when the emperors name was used to inspire 
japans troops 
after the war hirohito whom the japanese now call emperor 
showa visited all of japans prefectures except okinawa a string 
of southern islands where some of the wars bloodiest battles were 
fought and where ill feelings toward tokyo still linger 
radicals broke through security and hurled firebombs at akihito 
and michiko when they visited okinawa in 1975 akihito then crown 
prince and his wife narrowly escaped injury

tribal chiefs worried about the spread of 
aids have banned the ancient custom of widows and widowers having 
sex with a relative of their late spouse to cleanse themselves 
chiefs in chikankata and monze districts about 80 miles south 
of lusaka ordered a halt to the practice after aids educators 
visited a health ministry spokesman said thursday 
under the custom a widow would have sex with one of her 
husbands brothers and a widower would arrange a sexual encounter 
with one of his late wifes relatives 
the tradition contributed to the spread of aids especially 
of course if a spouse died from aids said the spokesman who 
was not identified in keeping with standing practice 
in africa aids is mainly spread by heterosexual contact and the 
use of contaminated blood or medical equipment the problem is 
aggravated by poor health services in isolated areas 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
zambia has one of the worlds highest aids rates up to 20 
percent of the population of 75 million people is believed 
infected with the virus that causes the disease 
in march the government told the world health organization that 
zambia had 2417 cases of aids

a longmisclassified fossil of a 280 
millionyearold animal with three pairs of horns on its head is a 
missing link in the family tree of the ancient reptiles that were 
ancestors of the mammals according to a report today 
researchers believe the creature known as tetraceratops 
represents an evolutionary step between the older reptilelike 
animals called the pelycosaurs and the later therapsids that were 
forerunners of the mammals 
the fossil skull was discovered around the turn of the century 
in texas but its evolutionary significance was not recognized 
because it was surrounded in rock that was hard to remove 
the discovery of its place in evolution was made by michel 
laurin and robert r reisz of the university of toronto they 
reported their work in the british journal nature 
as the most primitive known therapsid they wrote 
tetraceratops bridges the large morphological gap between 
primitive and advanced mammallike reptiles 
they based their analysis largely on the shape of the bones and 
teeth of the fossilized head it combined primitive features of the 
pelycosaurs as well as hints of the more modern therapsids that 
came after them 
since only the creatures head was recovered the scientists did 
not speculate about the size or shape of its body 
the animals lived before the rise of the dinosaurs which ruled 
the planet during the mesozoic era which began 225 million years 
ago the first mammals were tiny shrewlike animals that lived 
during the jurassic period between 180 million and 130 million 
years ago

walter skeet rogers put on metal 
gloves grabbed a 3footlong alligator and slung it into a cotton 
wagon moving it to high ground before flood waters got it 
the last time we got to fooling with them one man got 47 
stitches rogers said explaining the gloves 
rogers 4000 alligators were hatched from eggs gathered from 
wild nests and raised in doubledecked ponds in four 
climatecontrolled cinderblock buildings two more buildings are 
under construction at his bayou pierre gator farm located on low 
land near the bayou for which it is named 
about 200 square miles of louisiana is flooded by water from the 
red river and backwaters such as bayou pierre most of the land in 
a sparsely settled section of the state is for farming cotton 
wheat soybeans 
rogers crop is different though no less threatened 
its awful the water keeps coming up said alice hart 
rogers mother ive been right here for 12 years and nothing 
like this has ever happened before 
theyll drown skeet sold off some of the big ones but the 
rest will just drown if it keeps coming up 
with hides bringing 35 a linear foot and demand for alligator 
meat high alligator farming is a burgeoning industry in an 
economically depressed state louisiana has 92 licensed gator 
farms twodozen license applications are pending three years ago 
there were 13 alligator farms in louisiana 
buddy goatcher an alligator biologist with the state department 
of wildlife and fisheries said it is possible gators could be 
drowned if trapped in deep water for a long time with no firm 
resting place 
the farmer cant predict how long the waters will be up 
goatcher said and you cant predict the force of the water it 
could knock down the building and send gators spewing all over the 
place 
the threat is not so much to the wellbeing of the gators 
theyd love it he said the threat is losing the farm 
along with the buildings and the concrete ponds special heaters 
are necessary to keep it warm enough for a good hatching rate and 
optimum growth 
he doesnt want a lot of cold water coming in goatcher said 
rogers and two helpers roy cheatwood and his son roy jr 
piled homemade sandbags around pumps heaters and other immovable 
equipment trying to protect them from the flood 
the alligators were packed into four cotton wagons parked on a 
nearby mound 
each gator had to be moved by hand 
we cant get behind them with horses and drive them to high 
ground rogers said

president bush said today that civil rights 
laws should not be turned into some lawyers bonanza and he 
will reject any legislation that he believes will result in hiring 
quotas 
i want to sign a civil rights bill but i will not sign a quota 
bill bush told a rose garden audience in a ceremony to honor the 
newly reconstituted presidents commission on civil rights 
the justice department has raised the possibility that bush 
would veto civil rights legislation pending in congress the 
department contends it would establish unconsitutional minority 
quotas many republicans have joined democrats and the chairman of 
bushs civil rights commission in contending it does not require 
quotas 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater earlier stopped short 
of saying the administration would veto the legislation we are 
not repeating the veto threat he said this week 
on capitol hill senate supporters of the bill softened it 
somewhat today and immediately drew fresh support from two 
republicans and six democrats bringing the total cosponsors to 47 
in the 100member senate 
there are several others who are very close and i think there 
are others who will be coming on board sen john c danforth 
rmo said as he and sen john heinz rpa added their names as 
cosponsors 
bush said today his goal is to make sure that affirmative 
action is not reduced to some empty slogan and that this principle 
of striking down all barriers to advancement has real living 
meaning to all americans 
we will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we 
work to advance americas civil rights agenda he said to 
applause from the audience that included many civil rights leaders 
this administration seeks equal opportunity and equal 
protection and equal protection under the law for all americans 
bush said 
he said he would enthusiastically support legislation that 
backs up the principles of removing employment barriers based on 
race religion sex color or national origin does not result in 
quota systems promotes fairness in the legal system and 
protection against harassment based on race sex religion or 
physical disability 
our civil rights laws however should not be turned into some 
lawyers bonanza that could result from complaints of 
discrimination under the law he said 
bushs remarks followed a series of meetings with civil rights 
leaders on the socalled kennedyhawkins legislation which is 
still awaiting final action in both the house and senate 
although it does not call for quotas of minority applicants 
critics contend that would be its result 
the legislation would undo a supreme court decision that 
narrowed the ability of minorities to win monetary damages for job 
discrimnation and would restore the burden of proof to defendants 
in cases where employers hiring practices allegedly had a 
discriminatory impact 
no one here today would want me to sign a bill whose 
unintended consequences are quotas because quotas are wrong and 
they violate the most basic principles of our civil rights 
tradition and the basic principles of the promise of democracy 
bush said 
the key change made by senators today would alter a provision of 
the bill designed to undo the supreme courts 1989 wards cove 
decision involving a fairhiring case at an alaskan salmon cannery 
under the decision employers named in fairhiring lawsuits must 
either end lopsided hiring practices or prove that they represent 
business necessity as the bill initially went into the hopper 
employers would have to prove that discrimination was essential 
to job performance 
the new version would require only proof that such practices had 
a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective job 
performance

an appeals court panel today upheld the 
power of the us army corps of engineers to regulate the flow of 
water from a 232milelong missouri river reservoir 
the threejudge panel overruled a district court decision that 
had ordered the corps last week to temporarily reduce by about 
onethird the discharge from the oahe reservoir 
the upper missouri river basin states of south dakota north 
dakota and montana brought the suit in an effort to protect their 
sport fishing industry which officials say is being decimated by 
the low river levels 
the case has created controversy among seven midwestern states 
the downstream states of nebraska iowa kansas and missouri are 
aligned with the corps 
the panel which heard arguments in the case wednesday said it 
announced a decision today because of the urgency of the issue it 
said it would release a formal opinion later 
on friday the panel issued an emergency stay blocking the lower 
court order 
today the panel said the district court erred in concluding 
that the corps was arbitrary and capricious in making its decision 
about water flow 
the corps appealed the ruling issued last wednesday by us 
district judge patrick comny in bismarck nd that the level of 
lake oahe be maintained until june 1 when the walleye hatch is 
completed 
john stahr a justice department trial attorney representing the 
corps said it was acutely aware of the harm to the tourism 
industry caused by drought in the area 
however to reduce the oahe discharges by onethird would mean 
halting barge traffic between sioux city iowa and st louis a 
730mile shipping channel because the river level would be too 
low stahr said 
former gov william janklow of south dakota a lawyer 
representing the dakotas and montana argued that a temporary 
disruption in barge traffic must be balanced against the viability 
of the economy of central south dakota which relies heavily on 
missouri river tourism 
lake oahe stretches north from a dam just north of pierre sd 
to just south of bismarck

opened a shoeboxsized package 
both packages were mailed from small towns in bladen county 
nc investigators said postal inspectors have released two 
similar composite drawings of men suspected of mailing the packages

attacks against evangelical christians 
robertson also mentioned an april 17 arson at the offices of 
gospel singer sandi patti in anderson ind 
ms patti and a fire department investigator said there were no 
indications of any connection between the arson and the bombings 
the fire caused 650000 in damage

several years ago but its slowed down in the last few months 
robertson said

have been years where we would receive more threats than we do 
today

bombing at cbn said the rev brandt gustavson president of the 
825member national religious broadcasters we have supplied some 
names and addresses of our members to the postal inspectors 
osteens lakewood church in houston is taking added precautions 
the only thing that we have done any different is that the 
us marshals office is scanning our mail on daily basis said 
renee branson a church spokeswoman the post office takes our 
mail to the marshals who scan it before it is taken to the local 
post office for delivery to us it takes a day or so longer but 
nobody seems to mind

plans to beam prodemocracy messages to 
china from a radio ship have been postponed indefinitely an 
organizer said thursday because taiwan refused to allow a powerful 
transmitter through customs 
we are anticommunist but we cannot violate international 
law government spokesman shaw yuming said this government 
does not support the broadcasting plans and we cannot help them 
install the transmitters 
without the transmitter sent from france it would be impossible 
to proceed with the broadcasts said christophe nick an organizer 
of the goddess of democracy ship 
nick refused to blame taiwan but shaw said customs would not 
approve the transmitter 
although taiwans ruling nationalist party is the sworn enemy of 
the beijing government tensions between the two sides have eased 
in recent years and taiwan wants to avoid angering beijing 
china has accused taiwan of secretly helping the goddess of 
democracy and has refused to rule out the use of force to stop the 
broadcasts 
the nationalist government has denied involvement in the project 
and has said it opposed unauthorized broadcasts from international 
waters 
the 1200ton vessel which left france on march 17 arrived in 
the northern port of keelung on sunday to take on provisions before 
sailing into international waters to broadcast toward communist 
china 
organizers originally planned to leave keelung thursday and 
begin broadcasts the following day but the customs difficulties 
appear to have stymied the project 
organizers had hoped the taiwanese government would look more 
favorably on the project sponsored by a coalition of press 
organizations headed by the french magazine actuel 
the association will never stop trying to broadcast nick 
said never never never 
the ship is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in 
tiananmen square in beijing in may 1989 it was destroyed during 
the june 4 military crackdown that left hundreds perhaps 
thousands of civilians dead

a former panamanian president says his son 
shouldnt be on trial for threatening to kill president bush 
because thats the way we express ourselves in panama 
demetrio b lakas president of panama from 197278 told jurors 
wednesday that death threats are a way of life in the country where 
he lives and where his son otto lakas was born 
my life was threatened thousands of times the elder lakas 
said thats the way we express ourselves saying it and doing it 
are two different things 
otto lakas is accused of making the threat in a discussion with 
the managers of a pawnshop where he was looking at a gun 
in the us district court trials second day today family and 
friends continued testifying about the nonaggressive nature of 
lakas a 21yearold architecture student at lubbock christian 
university 
when otto sees pain in others he assumes the pain his 
mother elizabeth lakas said i am very proud to have him for my 
son 
lakas reportedly said he had a bullet with bushs name 
engraved on it and if the president came to lubbock he was 
going to blow his expletive head off 
family and friends have characterized the statements as a joke 
but secret service agents took lakas at his word and have jailed 
him without bond since april 17 
if convicted he faces a 5year prison term or a 250000 fine 
or both 
lakas attorney tommy turner told jury members the government 
would be unable to prove lakas understood and meant what he was 
saying or that he knowingly and willfully intended to be taken 
seriously 
prosecutor paulina jacobo would not comment about what the 
government could prove 
stacy and tracy nichols twin brothers who manage their parents 
exect pawn shop said they talked to otto lakas on april 4 for 
almost three hours while lakas considered buying a 357 colt 
revolver 
stacy nichols said lakas told him he wanted the gun for 
protection 
while discussing everything that 21yearolds talk about 
stacy nichols said lakas voiced anger about the december invasion 
of panama by us troops i have a 223caliber rifle at home and 
a bullet with bushs name engraved on it nichols quoted lakas as 
saying in a secret service affidavit stacy nichols said in an 
april 17 secret service affidavit that he was afraid to report 
lakas statements to authorities because he was afraid that otto 
lakas will retaliate 
but nichols testified wednesday that lakas alleged threats were 
the only serious part of a threehour conversation filled with 
jokes 
nichols said he liked lakas and was never concerned for his own 
safety while lakas was in the pawnshop despite the threats 
nichols said he would have sold the revolver to lakas if lakas had 
produced the money 
nichols said the incident would never have been reported if they 
hadnt told a friend who is a police officer about the 
conversation the officer told a secret service agent john steven 
barker 
barker said a search of lakas apartment produced a 3030 
caliber rifle a box of bullets also was found but none was 
engraved with bushs name barker said

community and state leaders voiced support 
thursday for a youth service bill 
youth service tells young people they are needed appeals to 
their desire to participate and gives them an opportunity to make a 
difference said david liederman executive director of the child 
welfare league of america inc 
the support boosts efforts of the house education and labor 
committee which is preparing to consider legislation that puts it 
at odds with a senatepassed bill tying youth community work with 
student financial aid 
our agencies are in complete agreement with you that service 
should be entirely voluntary and nonparticipation should not 
disqualify young americans from any existing educational loans 
grants or opportunities liederman said 
the house bill would authorize 35 million for schoolbased 
programs that make community service an important element of 
learning 25 million in grants to institutions of higher education 
to create or expand service opportunities for their students 30 
million to fund demonstration programs targeted to school dropouts 
and rural youth and 93 million to establish three specific youth 
oriented demonstration programs 
liederman who said his group is the oldest and largest 
membership organization of child and youth serving agencies with 
more than 650 members throughout north america was among a host of 
community and state leaders who urged quick passage of the national 
service act of 1990 during the final hearing on the bill 
the senate passed its version in early march 
chairman augustus hawkins dcalif said the house committee 
probably would consider the legislation before july and hoped floor 
action would follow soon after 
the house measure rejects any link between service and student 
financial assistance hawkins said the house version was intended 
to build upon worthwhile local and state efforts and to enhance 
their potential for addressing unmet social needs 
liederman said the range of programs created by the bill should 
attract and make services available to every type of young person 
the program he said shifts youths from being clients to 
community resources 
our youth are not unwilling to serve said john buchanan 
jr a former congressman who is chairman of people for the 
american way action fund a liberal group 
the underlying principle of the national service act rightly 
assumes that american young people will embrace community service 
if the opportunities are presented to them involvement in service 
activities enables young people whether poor or affluent 
residents of the inner cities or suburbs achievers or atrisk 
children to realize that they have much to give to their 
community 
brian holloway of the new york state division for youth said 
structured dynamic programs were needed to expose youth to 
meaningful and practical experience responsibility participation 
membership through community service in schools and on a fulltime 
basis

protest so quickly we felt it wasnt worth fighting them 
for the time being we are reverting to the standard pool 
coverage said herrick who arranges many of the news pools 
the networks cbs abc nbc and cnn skipped two bush meetings 
with groups lobbying on a civil rights bill wednesday 
earlier they went along with the limited twocamera pool 
coverage of other bush meetings including the start of the budget 
summit with congressional leaders tuesday 
fitzwater argued that the networks and independent television 
stations alike could get more and better pictures if only two pool 
cameras were sent into the oval office and other parts of the white 
house with limited space 
there is only one camera in the tight travel pool of reporters 
and crew members who accompany the president whenever he leaves the 
white house including flights aboard air force one 
radio networks in a gesture of sympathy also declined to send 
in a reporter to cover the two bush meetings wednesday

record exports helped keep the us trade 
deficit in march below its 1989 monthly average the government 
reported thursday and analysts said the gap could narrow to less 
than 100 billion this year for the first time since 1983 
the commerce department said the march deficit totaled 845 
billion down from the 9 billion monthly gap last year but a sharp 
385 percent increase over february 
the jump resulted in part from a 10 percent increase in imports 
to 4172 billion their highest level in five months but 
economists said the advance was a rebound from an 81 percent 
decline in imports in february which they called an aberration 
the department said exports totaled 3328 billion in march up 
46 percent from february and breaking the previous record of 319 
billion set last january the deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports 
the economists called the increase in exports a bright sign for 
the overall economy 
if they stay up theres just almost no way we can have a 
recession said bruce steinberg senior economist with merrill 
lynch capital markets in new york who forecasts a deficit of 95 
billion or less this year its absolutely what we need for our 
economy to prosper 
rising exports mean a stronger economy because more jobs and 
profits are created as american factories produce more that 
produces more taxes and helps close the gap between what the 
government receives and what it spends 
but with rising imports as reported for march lead to a 
decline in us production and a loss in jobs as americans spend 
more on products made overseas 
howard lewis vice president of the national association of 
manufacturers said exports are growing twice as fast as imports 
and represent 30 to 40 percent of our economic growth over the 
past three years 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher noted the 239 billion 
firstquarter imbalance was the smallest in more than six years and 
continued the downward trend in the deficit 
strong export growth was the key to these favorable results 
he said i expect that we will see the trade deficit break 100 
billion this year 
the deficit peaked at 15212 billion in 1987 and then dropped 
to 11853 billion the following year and to 109 billion last 
year it has been above the 100 billion level since 1983 when it 
totaled 524 billion 
the march exports represented nice increases in computers 
electrical machinery industrial machinery and scientific 
equipment steinberg said 
holding down the export number was a decline in aircraft 
shipments which robert brusca chief financial economist with 
nikko securities co in new york said resulted from the recent 
boeing co strike 
when the boeing strike ended at the end of last year he 
said aircraft shipments were running at abnormal levels now 
they are back down to more normal levels 
samuel d kahan chief financial economist with fuji securities 
inc in chicago noted much of the import increase was 
concentrated in automobiles and other consumer goods which to some 
extent may be seasonal 
oil imports totaled 261 million barrels up 74 percent from 
february but prices fell from 1939 to 1818 a barrel in march 
making the 47 billion import bill virtually the same as the 
previous month 
as usual the deficit with japan was the largest of any country 
it totaled 36 billion followed by china and taiwan 600 million 
each mexico and brazil 300 million each and canada 100 
million 
the united states posted a 700 million surplus with the 
countries of western europe

president bush today voiced strong support for 
a united germany with full control over all its territory and 
said reunification should completely end the allies postwar rights 
in germany 
forty five years after the end of the war there is no reason 
that a unified democratic germany should be in any way singled out 
for some special status bush said after meeting with west 
germany chancellor helmut kohl 
britain france and the united states support west germanys 
call for a reunified germany to be part of nato but the soviet 
union the fourth of the big world war ii victors argues that 
the new germany should be neutral or a member of both nato and the 
warsaw pact 
whats clear bush said is that the united states and the 
federal republic of germany share the same approach and have the 
same goals regarding german unification 
we both want a united germany which enjoys full sovereignty a 
united germany which is a full member of the western community and 
of the nato alliance including participation in its integrated 
military structures he said 
bush said that a reunified germany should have full control 
over all of its territory without any new discriminatory 
constraints on german sovereignty 
he said he and kohl agreed that us forces should remain 
stationed in the united germany and elsewhere in europe to continue 
to promote stability and security 
kohl thanked bush for the magnificent support he had given 
germans on our path to german unity 
kohl said that a reunified germany must remain a member of nato 
but he urged that the alliance concentrate more on its political 
role than its military one 
as the threat is decreasing appreciably the alliance must 
keep the initiative in the field of disarmament and arms control 
and review its strategy and structure he said 
earlier at an oval office picturetaking session kohl said he 
could not say whether german unity would come before the end of the 
year even though he had said earlier that allgerman elections 
could come as early as dec 2 
nobody knows that we know that the people are shouting we 
are the people this is why nobody can fix an exact date but 
everythings going very well we can say that 
kohls christian democratic party lost two west german state 
elections on sunday which some analysts saw as a reflection of 
concern by voters over the cost and pace of reunification 
kohl said he intended to discuss the issue with bush although 
added that bush is well versed on the issue already 
i think its been rare to find a president in the history of 
the united states who knows german history and german politics so 
well as this president and european politics said kohl 
speaking through a translator 
and that of course is a lucky thing for us and i think that 
you should write that kohl told reporters 
so do i bush chimed in 
bush and kohl were also expected to discuss arms control troops 
in europe and the situation in the rebellious soviet republics of 
lithuania estonia and latvia 
it was bushs final facetoface meeting with the nations key 
allies as he prepares for his summit in two weeks with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev a superpower conference bush says 
is strained by the baltic standoff 
kohl recently joined french president francois mitterrand in 
urging lithuanian leaders to lower some of their demands and seek a 
negotiated settlement with the kremlin 
bush has urged restraint on both sides 
but administration sources said bush is frustrated at lack of 
progress toward a resolution of the baltic issue particularly with 
respect to lithuania the kremlin maintains a partial economic 
blockade of the breakaway state 
bush told a news conference wednesday that the pressure the 
soviet union is applying to the baltic states has certainly put 
some tension on the summit between himself and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev they meet in washington from may 30june 3 
we want to see negotiations or dialogue or whatever you call 
it discussions between gorbachev and the lithuanians get going 
and then id like to see the release of that economic pressure on 
lithuania and that would clear the air fast the president said 
on wednesday lithuanias parliament offered to suspend laws it 
has enacted since declaring the republics independence if the 
kremlin agrees to negotiate however the resolution did not 
involve rescinding the march 11 declaration of independence as the 
kremlin demanded a spokeswoman said 
todays session with kohl was the presidents concluding session 
with western allied leaders before the summit last month he met 
with british prime minister margaret thatcher in bermuda and 
mitterrand in key largo fla 
he also has met with canadian prime minister brian mulroney and 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu

a top economic adviser to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev said thursday all economic reforms 
in his country have failed and he appealed to western economists 
businesses and governments for help 
if the west would help this would in fact make the whole 
difference said stanislav shatalin 
he spoke at a news conference called to discuss a new plan 
whereby western experts review soviet and eastern european economic 
reform proposals 
we have come to a very profound conclusion that without the 
cooperation of the west we simply cant build a market economy 
said shatalin who is the only economist on the presidential 
council that has been working on gorbachevs reforms 
im sure the president too shares this position shatalin 
said 
shatalin was not specific about the type of western aid moscow 
would like to see nor did he mention what political compromises 
if any gorbachev might consider to secure western support 
however friction over the baltic republics drive for 
independence and the soviet refusal to consider a united germany in 
nato would likely block any massive governmental aid from the west 
now 
echoing similar comments by gorbachev shatalin said many 
soviets oppose a market economy expected to bring price increases 
and unemployment 
he cited an unspecified poll that he said showed 54 percent of 
soviets supported market reforms but 46 percent were firmly 
against them 
shatalin said however a market economy was the only choice 
he said the soviet union has decided along with other east 
european nations to join a new plan uniting about 50 top experts 
to cull through reforms before they are implemented 
the operation is being run by the international institute for 
applied systems analysis based outside vienna it has brought 
together soviet east european and western economists and other 
academics since it was founded in 1972 
the soviet union needs the import of the best possible 
brains to succeed in economic change shatalin said 
he admitted that reforms introduced by gorbachev specifically 
in 1988 and 1989 had failed to improve the economy if anything 
the situation has deteriorated he said 
in 1988 state enterprises were supposed to gain greater 
independence from central planning authorities but bureaucrats 
found ways around the new laws by introducing state orders the 
enterprises had to meet and thus retained control over the bulk of 
their production 
the economic deterioration is evident to soviet consumers who 
face shortages of food and other goods 
asked why the soviet leadership had not acted earlier to move to 
a market economy shatalin again pointed to popular opposition 
if you dont have real political support for the reforms they 
die out he said 
gorbachevs latest package of promised reforms has yet to be 
unveiled the president told reporters thursday the public was to 
blame for their failure so far 
changing peoples minds is the most difficult thing he 
said perestroika depends on public opinion and its 
conservative 
shatalin also blamed the relatively poor education of soviet 
economists for the failures to date 
for a long time ive said the level of our education in 
economics is medieval he said 
the whole process of becoming more intelligent more capable 
is moving more slowly than it should he said

leaky marble roof and crumbling garage the facilitys top 
administrator said thursday 
james d wolfensohn told the house subcommittee on buildings and 
grounds that river and roof terraces parapets planters and 
building systems also need repairs 
however he said there was no danger to the estimated 49 
million people who visit the 7000seat theater complex each year 
if i thought it was unsafe we would close the building 
wolfensohn said but we need to ensure the safety of the building 
continues 
wolfensohn who has been chairman of the center for six weeks 
said the sprawling structure overlooking the potomac river had been 
poorly maintained and that fundraising would not be able to meet 
high repair costs

advance ticket sales to pay bills and a 153 million deficit 
wolfensohn said 
the national park service performs daily maintenance but 
wolfensohn wants congress to consider who is ultimately responsible 
for all upkeep of the 750 million building 
wolfensohn said the fivetheater facility was not in danger of 
closing 
the performing arts is geerally a money loser wolfensohn

police stepped up security outside east 
germanys parliament thursday after authorities reported death 
threats against the president of the chamber 
a bloc of leftist east german lawmakers criticized the security 
measures saying they were reminiscent of the policies of the 
ousted communist regime 
interior minister petermichael diestel said the dozens of extra 
police and roadblocks were needed around the peoples chamber were 
necessary because of numerous death threats against parliament 
president sabine bergmannpohl 
the threats that reached us are credible he said 
diestel in charge of police functions in east germany said 
authorities have also registered an increase in thefts of weapons 
and explosives recently 
the interior minister refused to give further details about the 
case 
in recent days there has been increasing labor unrest as 
workers express fears that unification with west germany will cost 
tens of thousands of jobs in east germany 
there was no word as to whether the death threats were connected 
to the labor woes 
the leftist coalition called alliance 90 criticized the extra 
police presence saying it reminded them of the events of last 
year 
before his ouster october 18 hardline communist leader erich 
honecker ordered massive police forces into the streets to break up 
huge prodemocracy demonstrations

president mikhail s gorbachev said thursday that 
citizens fear of change is holding back the economic and political 
changes that would give them a better life 
in politics the public doesnt accept pluralism and it has 
complexes about ideological conceptions and cliches he told 
reporters at a parliamentary session in moscow 
take any sphere everywhere we are hindered by complexes 
gorbachev added people are saying chaos chaos collapse 
collapse when lenin watched a similar revolutionary process he 
said you know this chaos will crystallize a new form of life 
some of gorbachevs economic advisers in the past have said the 
publics conservative mood might hold back necessary economic 
reforms that could lead to higher prices and unemployment but 
gorbachev himself had not previously addressed the issue in such a 
forthright manner 
perestroika depends on public opinion and its 
conservative he said 
gorbachev has delayed an economic reform plan over the past two 
months aides have backed away from suggestions that polishstyle 
shock therapy was in store for the soviet economy radical 
measures in poland brought sudden price increases and unemployment 
gorbachev has promised that nothing will be decided without 
discussion he also indicated the reform program will not be 
discussed with his advisory presidential council until may 22 
he spoke with reporters in the kremlins ornate st georges 
hall during a break at the congress of the russian federation 
where reformers forced his candidate for president into giving an 
accounting of his performance as premier 
radicals said that will be embarrassing given the countrys 
economic crisis they hoped it could persuade gorbachev to withdraw 
russian premier alexander v vlasov from the race against political 
maverick boris n yeltsin and substitute a more centrist candidate 
otherwise gorbachev risks having russia the largest of the 
soviet unions 15 republics taken over by yeltsin the 
silverhaired siberian populist who is his most popular critic 
yet gorbachev was offhand when reporters asked him about the 
struggle between vlasov and yeltsin 
i see no drama in this he said this is all normal the 
communist party has given up its monopoly 
tomorrow or the next day new parties will appear with their 
own platforms and proposals and this will be a normal process 
newly elected radicals at the russian congress are trying to 
elect yeltsin and wrest control of the republics affairs away from 
the national government 
russia is the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics with 
52 percent of its people and threequarters of its land mass a 
radical takeover of the 1059member russian parliament threatens 
gorbachevs prestige it could also undermine his authority if 
radicals try to increase the russian parliaments power by 
declaring that its laws take priority over national ones 
speaking to reporters gorbachev suggested that political groups 
favoring reform should work together confrontation could lead to 
bloodshed he said 
we were brought up differently we think my opinion is right 
and the others are wrong as a result nobody is listening to 
anybody 
many hardliners are unhappy with gorbachevs recent moves to 
end the communist partys monopoly on power legalize private 
ownership of factories and otherwise upset basic laws of marxism 
in economics they say you must not touch this and you must 
not touch that gorbachev said 
turning to premier nikolai i ryzhkov who gave a television 
interview last week on economic reform proposals gorbachev said 
ryzhkov only said a few words and already there is great 
agitation in the country 
but the deputy premier in charge of economic reform said in the 
krasnoyarsk region of siberia that reforms will not be painless 
one model of the economy cannot be replaced by another without 
someone being hurt said deputy premier leonid abalkin 
in remarks carried by the official news agency tass he warned 
that the transition to the market is perhaps the last chance 
history gives to socialism only a market can heal our sick society 
and even bring prosperity 
abalkin said basic food prices will remain controlled and fixed 
incomes will rise to match expected inflation 
in vienna austria a top economic adviser to gorbachev said all 
economic reforms in the soviet union have failed and he appealed 
to western economists businesses and governments for help 
if the west would help this would in fact make the whole 
difference stanislav shatalin said at a news conference

the sponsor of legislation to extend the life 
of the troubled national endowment for the arts said thursday he 
was delaying the bill and asking arts experts to recommend changes 
in the way the nea operates 
rep pat williams dmont chairman of the house postesecondary 
education subcommittee said he wants artists and representatives 
of at least 17 artsrelated groups to meet next tuesday and suggest 
nea changes 
the nea has been criticized by conservatives who have tried to 
place new limits on the way it awards grants 
williams at a news conference said he was convinced the nea 
has broad support in congress but because of protests over the 
funding of recent controversial exhibits williams said a bill to 
reauthorize the nea for five years is unlikely to pass congress 
without some amendments 
williams is sponsoring a bill backed by the bush administration 
a group of republicans proposed an alternative that would give a 
portion of the neas money to the states for their distribution to 
the arts 
williams said he was cancelling a subcommittee vote on the bill 
that had been scheduled for next week until he meets with arts 
supporters 
id be surprised if they came out with a recommendation that 
said all is well williams said

firebombs fought police in kwangju and a dozen other cities 
thursday the eve of the 10th anniversary of a bloody 
antigovernment rebellion in kwangju 
meanwhile 27000 workers at the nations largest car plant 
continued a strike for a third day 
the nations 130000strong police force was on top alert after 
a major dissident coalition called for nationwide antigovernment 
protests to mark the kwangju anniversary friday 
at least 200 people died and more than 1700 were injured when 
troops and tanks crushed a may 18 1980 uprising in the southern 
city 
the munhwa broadcasting co said 20000 students joined in 
protests on 50 campuses thursday police reported arrests and 
injuries but gave no figures the national yonhap news agency said 
10 people were injured in one clash south of seoul 
in kwangju 155 miles south of seoul tension mounted as radical 
students and dissidents prepared to mark the uprising 
american residents and travelers in kwangju said the us 
embassy in seoul advised them to stay off certain streets 
the dissident peoples alliance announced in seoul that it would 
organize protests in several cities the alliance was a major force 
behind nationwide protests on may 9 that were the largest and most 
violent since 1987 
radicals and dissidents want the ouster of president roh 
taewoo they say the merger of his governing party with two 
opposition groups into the new democratic liberal party earlier 
this year was a political coup and marks a return to dictatorial 
rule in south korea 
in kwangju about 1000 students clashed with riot police around 
chonnam university hurling rocks and firebombs 
police fired barrages of tear gas from two armored vans sending 
clouds of the choking gas billowing over the schools main gate 
down with roh taewoo students shouted as they charged 
police in a steady rain drive out yankees 
during a campus rally before the clash students charged that 
the united states took a bystanders role during the 10day kwangju 
revolt thus condoning the crackdown by korean soldiers 
a huge placard showed a korean student ripping apart a us 
flag an american flag was painted on a schools road so people 
could walk on it 
about 7500 combatclad riot police were deployed in kwangju

a panel of medical pharmaceutical and legal 
experts began thursday examining the food and drug administration 
with an eye toward revitalizing an agency often embroiled in 
controversy 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan told the 
15member panel which he appointed to consider whether fdas 
energies and resources are focused on the right objectives 
sullivan said the fda which regulates about 25 percent of 
products sold to consumers has been under pressure in recent years 
to do more and more with less and less 
since 1979 congress has passed 21 bills giving the agency 
more tasks each of which added to the agencys mandate he said 
the fda staffing level has fallen from 8089 employees in 1980 
to 7877 this year 
also 506 employees currently work solely on aidsrelated 
projects none did 10 years ago staffing in the generic drug 
division which had 120 employees a decade ago has risen to 430 
most of the additional staff there was added because of the recent 
genericdrug corruption scandal 
fda acting commissioner james benson said that because of the 
nature of the agencys work well always be in the middle of 
some kind of controversy 
the fda regulates the quality of most of the nations foods and 
food additives as well as prescription and overthecounter drugs 
medical devices and cosmetics 
the agencys budget this year is 587 million and a 13 million 
supplemental appropriation is pending in congress 
the fda ended up in the eye of the storm when it removed chilean 
fruit from store shelves after a poisoning threat last year it is 
often attacked by aids activists who claim the agency moves too 
slowly in approving new drugs the fda also has been under fire for 
its handling of generic drugs 
the advisory committees formation was announced last december 
shortly after thenfda commissioner frank young left to become a 
deputy assistant secretary for health 
sources said at the time that young was forced out in part 
because of the generic drug scandal that has resulted so far in 13 
criminal convictions on charges ranging from bribery to 
racketeering those charged include generic drug companies their 
executives and fda employees 
the fda advisory committee is headed by dr charles c edwards 
a former fda commissioner four other members of the panel are 
former fda officials 
sullivan told the committee members to submit a preliminary 
report in four months and a final report one year from now

in a major breakthrough in the baltic impasse 
president mikhail s gorbachev met today with an official of 
lithuanias government for the first time since the republic 
declared independence 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene talked with 
gorbachev for two hours in the kremlin in what she called an 
introduction to coming negotiations a lithuanian spokesman said 
the meeting was an unexpected breakthrough in the dispute 
between the kremlin and lithuania that flared on march 11 when the 
baltic republic of 38 million people declared independence 
earlier today gorbachev lashed out at lithuanian leaders 
characterizing their actions as adventurism 
gorbachev has demanded that lithuania rescind the declaration 
the lithuanian government has refused but on wednesday its supreme 
council parliament offered to suspend laws passed since 
independence if the kremlin will open talks on its declaration of 
secession 
gorbachev and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov who also attended 
told mrs prunskiene the offer did not address their main concern 
that the lithuanian declaration of independence be suspended the 
tass news agency reported 
k prunskienes attention was drawn to the indispensable 
necessity that the lithuanian supreme soviet cancel or as a 
minimum suspend this act and all the legislative measures 
following it that contradict the soviet constitution tass 
reported it said the leaders told mrs prunskiene that concession 
was the only way to launch negotiations 
but tass said the leaders noted the lithuanian offer showed that 
certain steps had been made toward the normalization of the 
situation tass said 
mrs prunskiene called the meeting an introduction to coming 
negotiations longinas vasiliauskas press attache of the 
lithuanian representation in moscow said he said the prime 
minister would not report in detail on the meeting until friday 
tass said mrs prunskiene promised to report what had been said to 
the lithuanian supreme council parliament 
mrs prunskiene arrived in moscow earlier today seeking to meet 
with gorbachev who has imposed a partial economic embargo on 
lithuania in an effort to make it rescind independence laws it has 
passed 
mrs prunskiene said lithuania was willing to suspend its drive 
for independence and remain part of the soviet security system 
shortly before her arrival gorbachev told western reporters who 
questioned him about the baltics i believe that the lithuanian 
leadership and some others cannot get rid of adventurism 
asked whether he was aware that mrs prunskiene was in moscow 
seeking to present new concessions he said i have received no 
such request 
when gorbachev was asked if he was willing to meet with leaders 
from the breakaway baltic republics he looked one reporter in the 
eye then turned away and told his body guards lets move on 
in an interview with britains channel four television 
gorbachev was highly critical of the lithuanians 
a constructive approach is needed we will not permit any 
violation of the constitution or any division from the 
constitutional process he said 
mrs prunskiene also said she was seeking to meet secretary of 
state james a baker iii baker who is in moscow for meetings with 
the soviet leadership about the superpower summit at the end of the 
month 
she told reporters she had a tentative appointment with 
baker but had received no answer from gorbachev 
baker said he would press soviet leaders to explain why they 
have not begun talks with baltic leaders its not encouraging to 
us to see the absence of a dialogue between leaders there and the 
kremlin said baker 
in washington president bush said the standoff between moscow 
and the baltic republics certainly puts some tension on the 
planned summit

prime minister yitzhak shamir received a 21day 
extension thursday on his mandate to form israels new government 
and immediately ran into trouble with potential coalition partners 
shamir whose mandate was due to expire friday was granted the 
extension by president chaim herzog 
i hope i would not need all that period and would finish with 
it before it expires i dont want to name a date but i hope it 
would be soon shamir told reporters outside herzogs residence 
under israeli law a legislator entrusted by the president with 
forming a government is initially given three weeks and then may 
ask for an additional 21 days no president has ever rejected a 
request for an extension 
shamir indicated he asked for extra time because of disputes 
with potential partners over the distribution of cabinet posts as 
well as over the next governments guidelines 
each party has its aspirations and demands and i have to 
worry about the overall picture he said 
shamir head of the hardline likud bloc has tentative 
agreements that would give him a majority in the 120member 
parliament but he has been unable to sign pacts with three 
ultraright parties and three orthodox religious factions 
the rightwing tehiya party announced thusday it would not join 
his government because of likuds failure to meet party demands for 
government posts 
the radical rightwing moledet meanwhile said its ideological 
differences with likud could not be bridged the party advocates 
expulsion of arabs from the occupied territories and opposes 
shamirs plan of granting palestinians limited autonomy 
israel has been governed by shamirs 13member transition 
cabinet since march 15 when the leftleaning labor party 
engineered the collapse of likudlabor coalition over shamirs 
refusal to accept us proposals for an israelipalestinian 
dialogue in cairo 
herzog first asked labor leader shimon peres to try to form a 
government peres failed after five weeks and was forced to hand 
the mandate to shamir on april 26 
at the time likud signed a coalition accord with a fourmember 
faction headed by yitzhak modai a former finance minister the 
group had vacillated between the two rival camps for weeks 
a second agreement was signed with eliezer mizrahi a defector 
from the agudat israel ultraorthodox party which backs labor but 
now appears willing to consider a partnership with likud mizrahis 
move to likud robbed peres of the majority he needed to form a 
government 
shamir still needs to pin down formal pledges of backing from 
three religious parties and three ultrarightist factions among 
them tehiya and moledet to assure himself of a 61seat majority 
despite the entangled coalition negotiations with small parties 
shamir ruled out a new alliance with labor 
i did not discuss this possibility with mr peres and i think 
it is not realistic today he said 
in other developments labor announced it would delay by 10 days 
the publication of an internal report placing blame for the partys 
poor showing in the 1988 parliament elections and 1989 municipal 
balloting 
the report which reportedly criticizes peres was to have been 
published thursday it is expected to boost the campaign by former 
prime minister yitzhak rabin to oust peres as party boss

a panel said thursday that between 11000 and 
44000 sea turtles drown annually in shrimp nets and recommended 
that virtually all trawlers be required to use turtleexcluder 
devices for most of each year 
incidental capture and drowning in shrimp trawler nets 
accounts for more deaths than all other human activities 
combined among the five endangered species of sea turtles that 
live in the us waters of the atlantic ocean and gulf of mexico 
the national research council committee said 
though many studies estimated that 11000 loggerhead and kemps 
ridley turtles are killed annually by shrimp fishing the report 
said that figure was judged by this committee to be an 
underestimate possibly by as much as a factor of four other 
estimates by the committee put the number of turtles killed by 
shrimping each year at 55000 
a halt to shrimp trawling altogether could be required to 
preserve the sea turtle species the report said unless the 
industry takes vigorous measures to limit the number of turtles 
killed 
the committee believes that shrimping with adequate controls 
is compatible with the recovery of turtle populations the report 
said although prohibition of shrimp trawling might be required 
as a last ditch measure the committee said the use of new 
technology could reduce turtle deaths to a level that the 
populations can tolerate 
the committee said that the population kemps ridley turtles 
is dangerously small about 1 percent of the abundance found in 
a 1947 study since 1978 the number of nesting females the study 
said has dropped from 700 to 350 adult kemps ridley turtles live 
principally in the gulf of mexico and nest on beaches in mexico 
loggerhead turtles nesting on south carolina and georgia beaches 
are in decline the study said but are stable or increasing in 
some florida areas 
nestings of the other species green turtles hawksbills and 
leatherbacks seem to be stable or increasing slightly in some 
areas the report said 
the committee said that other human activity also kills many 
adult sea turtles but nothing is as lethal to the species as 
shrimping 
other types of commercial fishing the report said kills about 
550 turtles annually an estimated 400 turtles die from collisions 
with boats while others die from dredging and the removal of old 
oil rigs an unknown number of turtles the committee said die 
from swallowing discarded plastic debris which some turtles 
confuse with natural food 
environmental groups which have been battling to protect sea 
turtles hailed the report as a verification of the need to take 
strong measures 
the report confirms what other studies and assessments have 
found in the past and what we have been arguing for the last 10 
years said michael weber of the center for marine conservation 
capturing sea turtles in shrimp trawls is a major threat to their 
population in the united states 
congress requested the 1988 nrc study after passage of amendment 
to the endangered species act some congressmen from gulf states 
complained about federal regulations that required shrimpers to use 
net devices that are designed to prevent sea turtles from drowning 
the report said the turtles drown when they are caught in a 
funnelshaped net commonly dragged behind boats to capture shrimp 
that live near the ocean floor 
turtle excluder devices or teds are in effect trapdoors in 
the bottom of the nets that allow turtles to escape before they 
drown 
federal law now requires shrimpers to use teds while fishing 
from may 1 to aug 31 along the southern atlantic ocean coast and 
from march 1 to nov 30 in the gulf of mexico the nrs report said 
that the use of teds at all times in all areas could reduce the 
capture of turtles to about 3 percent of the rate that occurs 
without teds 
the report said that turtle survival rates also would improve if 
nets were not towed for longer than 40 minutes in the summer and 60 
minutes in the winter the approximate length of time a sea turtle 
can stay underwater without injury 
the nrc also called for protection of turtle nesting areas and 
recommended that a smallscale captive breeding program continue 
for kemps ridley turtles

congress should set up a special trust fund to 
guarantee availability of more than 100 billion for cleaning up 
radioactive wastes at nuclear weapons plants a senate panel was 
told thursday 
the energy department opposes the fund proposed by sen brock 
adams and rep norm dicks both washington state democrats the 
department claims it would duplicate cleanup plans initiated by 
energy secretary james d watkins 
but on thursday sens tim wirth dcolo and howard 
metzenbaum dohio joined an aide to washington gov booth gardner 
in pleading for the fund before the senate environment and public 
works committee 
they said a permanent financing plan is necessary to guard 
against future administrations that may lack a commitment to health 
and environmental safety 
we cant continue to push this problem off to future 
generations as it has been pushed off on us said dan silver a 
special assistant to gardner 
were fooling ourselves if we think we can continue in a 
nickelanddime fashion to try to clean up these places without a 
longterm commitment wirth added we are going to have to find 
a way of raising the ante significantly 
adams said watkins had made great strides in launching the 
cleanup of waste sites but he said the public remains skeptical 
about the commitment to provide the huge amounts of money necessary 
we must create a program so we dont run the risk of a 
different secretary or a different administration deciding that we 
can let this go for awhile he said 
the trust fund would be created with an appropriation of about 
62 billion over the next two years the money would be in lieu of 
an approximately equal amount regularly appropriated to doe for 
environmental activities adams said the fund would be sustained 
by assessments to commercial users of doe nuclear facilties and 
polluters 
leo duffy director of the energy departments office of 
environmental restoration and waste management said the proposal 
would complicate present budgeting requirements

rail workers nationwide stopped selling 
tickets and shuttling passengers thursday to demand better wages 
and job protection in a united germany where socialist guarantees 
of jobs for all will not exist 
the 30minute strikes were the latest in a series of worker 
demonstrations in recent weeks fueled by frustration over the 
possible effects on jobs and prices of unification with west 
germany 
they came on the eve of the signing of a treaty by german 
leaders that will merge the countries economies july 2 a major 
step to full unification 
in washington president bush met thursday with west germany 
chancellor helmut kohl and voiced strong support for a united 
germany with full control over all its territory 
the east german government news service adn said workers 
paralyzed main rail routes nationwide stopping work at switching 
yards ticket counters and on trains 
the socalled warning strikes were staged to protest what 
workers said was the failure of the government railroad company to 
meet demands for higher wages and job protection 
train traffic a principal form of daily transportation for many 
east germans was interrupted in the cities of magdeburg rostock 
gera schwerin and others adn said 
last week farmers teachers and textile workers held nationwide 
strikes to protest unemployment expected as east germany moves to a 
free market 
workers are seeking protection from joblessness and from the 
bettermade western imports already flooding the country many 
outmoded east german businesses are expected to fail in the first 
two years of economic unification 
east germans also are demanding higher wages to cope with the 
price increases expected when costs are set by the free market 
the strikes were held during the weekly session of parliament 
which debated the draft of a new constitution that will take old 
socialist laws off the books and establish east germany legally as 
a democracy 
it also would eliminate the old communist guarantee of full 
unemployment 
liberal lawmakers pressed for some employment guarantees in the 
new democratic charter 
wolfgang ullmann a lawmaker from a leftleaning opposition 
coalition called it a scandalous copy for wouldbe west 
german citizens 
he called for a new constitution that guarantees workers rights 
and warned of mass unemployment and a merciless economic 
war 
conservatives say the conversion to a free market and an 
increase in western investment will eventually raise living 
standards and provide jobs 
the economic treaty is to be signed friday by prime minister 
lothar de maiziere and kohl the parliaments of the two nations 
likely will consider it in june 
a full political merger is not expected until next year 
the centerpiece of the economic treaty is the circulation of 
west german marks as the official currency of east germany 
however the treaty leaves out how to shift east germanys 
publicly owned industries and property to the private sector to be 
the subject of further talks some east germans fear west german 
investors will buy up the nation 
kohl wants western investors to have an incentive for investing 
in east germanys moribund industrial sector while de maiziere 
wants some limits on how much property west germans can own 
western businesses already are forging deals with east german 
enterprises and western products are increasingly available in 
east germany 
on thursday the west german subsidiary of the giant american 
cigarette maker philip morris agreed to buy a cigarette plant in 
the east german city of dresden according to a report by adn 
american cigarette makers have inundated east germany with 
advertising in recent months in an effort to tap the market in this 
nation of heavy smokers 
also thursday the usbased computer manufacturer 
international business machine and a governmentrun data processing 
enterprise announced a cooperative agreement adn said 
the accord to develop software sales and service will result in 
higher quality for the east german firm adn quoted guenter rose 
head of the east german data processing center as saying 
in washington meanwhile bush said a reunified germany should 
have full control over all of its territory without any new 
discriminatory constraints on german sovereignty 
he also reiterated that a united germany should be part of nato 
we both want a united germany which enjoys full sovereignty a 
united germany which is a full member of the western community and 
of the nato alliance he said 
although the united states britain and france say germany 
should join the western alliance the soviet union the fourth 
world war ii victor has said it should remain neutral or a member 
of both nato and the warsaw pact

a pentagon task force is recommending that the 
government spend 100 million a year to develop advanced video 
systems such as highdefinition tv a published report said 
thursday 
that would be a 10fold increase over what the pentagon agency 
charged with hdtv development sought and received this year for 
advanced tv research 
the highresolution systems task force has forwarded the 100 
million recommendation to the defense science board which will 
discuss the proposal next week according to the washingtonbased 
trade publication communications daily 
a task force spokeswoman susan hansen said thursday she could 
not confirm the 100 million figure she said the task force 
recommendations were under review and would be considered by the 
board 
the recommendations she said could be discussed at the boards 
quarterly meeting next week the board made up chiefly of 
business executives educators and retired military personnel 
reports to defense secretary dick cheney 
proponents of hdtv which promises motionpicturequality images 
and compactdiscquality sound say it could help reenergize the 
us electronics and computer industries but others say hdtv wont 
be a popular consumer item until well into the next century 
the pentagon foresees military applications in radar and other 
displaytype technologies and has funded a modest research program 
through dapra its defense advanced projects research agency which 
also funds the sematech semicondutor consortium 
white house officials such as budget director richard darman 
reportedly have opposed efforts to single out private industries 
for government aid 
concern over using federal funds to support socalled dual use 
military and civilian technologies led to the recent reassignment 
of dapras director craig fields according to administration 
critics such as house majority leader richard gephardt dmo and 
rep mel levine dcalif 
an aide to levine jon cowan said the task force recommendation 
was an important first step but just a drop in the bucket 
compared with what the europeans and japanese already have spent on 
hdtv development 
europe eureka consortium has spent between 300 million and 400 
million on hdtv while japan has spent about 1 billion cowan said 
its upping the ante cowan said 
dapra spent 5 million in 1989 to fund research into 
highdefinition displays spokeswoman jan bodanyi said thursday 
the agency requested and received 10 million for 1990 and has 
requested 12 million for 1991 she said 
the agency has awarded several contracts to companies developing 
highdefinition display technology although some news reports have 
said the administration would not fund some of these awards 
congress appropriated an additional 20 million to darpa for 
1990 but the money cant be used until the agency tells congress 
among other things how it intends to spend the funds 
cowan said the stipulation gives the administration an excuse 
not to spend the money 
he said levine and others were drafting a bill requiring that 
all programs funded through darpa would be for military and 
civilian uses

capitalism 
his 6foothigh bronze sculpture titled break the wall of 
distrust depicts a young man breaching a wall it was placed on 
cannon street between st pauls cathedral and the bank of england 
tsereteli from tbilisi georgia is widely acknowledged as the 
leading soviet sculptor he said he sketched the design for the 
piece two weeks before the berlin wall was broken nov 9 1989 
i think people of talent and culture pick up a sense of whats 
in the air before the rest of us said a beaming trevor osborne 
chairman of developers speyhawk plc who commissioned the work for 
the corner of a new office block rented to a dutch bank 
to see a sculpture by a soviet artist in the heart of the city 
of london is a novel development and a sign of the times a sign of 
the great and positive changes in europe leonid zamyatin soviet 
ambassador in london told a small gathering 
zamyatin said he brought greetings to the ceremony from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze a georgian like the sculptor 
shevardnadze said he hopes this will be called tbilisi 
corner zamyatin said with a smile 
at the edge of the sidewalk travelers in a red doubledecker 
bus halted among taxis trucks vans and a rollsroyce gazed out 
the windows at the crowd on the corner while messengers on 
motorcycles skittered in and out and a jack hammer drilled close by 
richard luce arts minister in prime minister margaret 
thatchers businessoriented conservative government called it an 
honor and a privilege to unveil the sculpture 
millions of people sitting for hours in the london traffic 
will have the opportunity to look at it he said 
i have been to tbilisi which is a wonderful city in a 
wonderful country the timing by speyhawk is quite brilliant there 
are few better ways of developing better relations than through art 
and culture luce said 
osborne was looking for a sculptor to decorate his new building 
when he was introduced to tsereteli by connie middleton who had 
met the artist in tbilisi while arranging the first british auction 
of contemporary soviet art 
i signed the contract with the sculptor in my house on october 
27 1989 and i was amazed when the berlin wall was knocked down 
two weeks later osborne said

characters

americas favorite game show host 
henson always did those voices and had no substitute 
it also wasnt known whether hensons death or any new voices 
for the characters would be explained to the children who watch

mr hooper died at age 74 the next season young viewers were 
told about mr hoopers death 
viewers got the news on the thanksgiving program chosen because

store 
just because he was told 
another human character david said he had taken over the store 
and would be providing big birds beverages 
at the end of the segment big bird hung a drawing of mr hooper

a shortage of nurses is hurting the quality of 
care for patients in the nations hospitals according to a 
readership survey released thursday by the federation of nurses and 
health professionals 
ninety percent of the 1304 nurses who responded said the 
shortage is a problem where they work nearly three out of four 
said it has harmed the quality of patient care at their facility 
federation officials said 
they cant get into rooms to take care of patients as fast as 
they need to because of their patient load and a growing number 
of nonnursing duties said candice owley federation vice 
president 
they are more apt to make medication errors and other 
errors in part because they are working long hours because of 
overtime demands she said 
owley said she did not know of any deaths that had resulted 
directly from the shortage but she said the possibility was there 
if you are not able to see a change in a monitor or that a 
respirator is disconected these patients lives are on the line 
and you have to be concerned that this is happening she said 
the survey was based on 1582 responses to a questionnaire that 
ran in the march issue of the federations monthly newsletter 
healthwire of those responding 84 percent said they were nurses 
registered nurses the rest worked in other healthcare jobs 
the federation is a division of the american federation of 
teachers it represents 40000 health care workers across the 
country 
federation officials said they had no estimate on the number of 
nurses needed to alleviate the shortage 
the american hospital association said more than 10 percent of 
the budgeted positions for registered nurses were vacant in 
december 1988 
about 15 milion registered nurses are employed said jewell 
gould research director for the federation 
he said labor department figures show that an additional 613000 
rns will be needed by the turn of the century the additional 
nurses will be needed because there will be more elderly americans 
in the year 2000 than there are now and they are more prone to 
needing health care

federal regulators said thursday they have 
fined a new york utility 75000 more than the usual amount for 
inability to handle nonroutine radioactivity brought to light when 
a worker irradiated his thumb 
the fine was imposed by the staff of the nuclear regulatory 
commission against the new york power authority for an incident 
march 8 at its ja fitzpatrick nuclear plant in oswego on the 
shore of lake ontario that exposed three workers to radiation 
the authority will not contest the penalty said spokesman carl 
patrick in new york city 
the worker was using a radioactive tracer sodium24 to measure 
water flow in a piping system according to a commission 
announcement 
he became contaminated because he handled the cap on the tracer 
container with his gloved hand instead of tongs or tweezers then 
took off the gloves his left thumb touched the contaminated 
gloves exposing it to an estimated 488 rem 
federal regulations limit the exposure of bodily extremities to 
1875 rem every three months a rem is a unit of radiation dose to 
humans 
other workers became contaminated to an unspecified lesser 
extent as they helped decontaminate the first worker the 
commission said 
plant managers did not adequately plan and supervise the job 
the commission announcement said 
the march 8 and earlier incidents represent a breakdown in the 
management control of the radiation safety program at your facility 
and demonstrate the need for improved planning and control of 
radiation protection activities and particularly for those 
activities involving nonroutine radiologically significant 
tasks thomas t martin the commissions regional administrator 
said in a letter to the authority 
patrick said the authority has begun to retrain workers and is 
revising procedures for nonroutine tasks 
as for the other incidents patrick said another employee was 
contaminated about two years ago when workers were cutting 
radioactive materials underwater a piece came out of the water and 
the worker picked it up patrick said 
another exposure occurred when workers failed to notice a piece 
of radioactive material had floated to the top of the fuel pool he 
said

social security commissioner gwendolyn king 
lashed out at congressional critics thursday for unfairly depicting 
social security as a stumbling inept agency down on its knees 
it bothers me and its fair to say it bothers people at 
social security that we always seem to get dumped on and nobody 
ever takes the time to say you know that was a good job mrs 
king said 
mrs king said she welcomed constructive criticism but worried 
that unfair reports would undermine confidence in social security 
youre going to get people frightened and concerned about 
whether the system is going to be there to serve them she said 
the impression left of a stumbling inept agency down on its 
knees is one that really does translate into a real problem for 
people in the field 
she said she found it particularly galling that critics in 
congress have been soliciting horror stories from social security 
caseworkers 
you have to look at the big picture and not focus on all the 
anecdotes that you can muster mrs king said social security 
is across the board serving people answering telephones 
handling problems and its amazing to me how well theyre doing 
mrs kings comments came in an interview with the associated 
press a day before she was scheduled to testify before the special 
senate committee on aging it was to be another in a string of 
congressional hearings on service problems at the social security 
administration 
the agency whose staff was slashed by 20 percent during the 
reagan administration has been faulted for declining service 
providing inaccurate information and frequent busy signals on its 
800number telephone network 
mrs king who took over the agency in august said her 
frustration was aimed not only at congress she alluded to negative 
media coverage of the agency and cited disgruntled employees who 
come in with gripes and criticims that may have been relevant a 
year ago 
from every sector you will find people zeroing in on a 
microcosm of problems anecdoctal in nature and certainly needing 
fixing mrs king said while we care about every single person 
i do have to keep the big picture in mind 
mrs king said the agency had improved its operations over the 
past year sharply reduced the busy signals on its 800number and 
hired 500 workers to address staffing shortages a study by the 
inspector general of the department of health and human services 
found a large majority of those surveyed found service helpful and 
accurate she said 
mrs king invited her critics to be a part of the solution and 
not just a part of the griping problem 
she criticized several legislative proposals including a bill 
to separate the social security administration from the hhs she 
said another proposal to require that local social security phone 
numbers not just the 800number be listed in telephone books was 
specious and trite 
surely the us congress has more important business to get 
about she said

the first of manuel noriegas codefendants to be 
punished in the drug smuggling case was sentenced thursday to 30 
months in prison but may only have to serve 15 months 
panamanian pilot eduardo pardo has cooperated with the us 
attorneys office in its investigation of the deposed panamanian 
leader and will continue to do so his attorney told us district 
judge william hoeveler 
pardo 44 pleaded guilty in february to one count of illegal 
travel for flying 800000 in cocaine profits from florida to 
panama in 1983 
pardo had faced a maximum fiveyear federal prison sentence and 
a 10000 fine 
assistant us attorney michael sullivan recommended leniency 
for pardo he said the defendant had turned over evidence that 
helped investigators track the movements of other codefendants 
including his flight log 
we intend to talk to him more sullivan said 
tears ran down pardos face as his attorney william meadows 
pleaded for probation pardo declined an opportunity to speak on 
his own behalf 
he pleaded guilty because he knew that he did something 
wrong meadows said he was deeply remorseful for it and he 
said he has not done anything similar before or since 
meadows noted that pardo had no previous criminal record and 
surrendered voluntarily to us authorities in panama city 
following the dec 20 invasion of panama 
under sentencing guidelines pardo would be freed in 20 months 
including five already served but hoeveler made a point of telling 
meadows he would welcome a motion to reduce the sentence if pardo 
continued cooperating with investigators 
outside the courtroom samuel burstyn attorney for codefendant 
luis del cid said the sentence would keep pardo in the united 
states until after the noriega trial planned for early next year 
burstyn said the sentence was obviously aimed at keeping 
pardo available to the government 
the attorney also revealed that his client whod been 
negotiating a plea bargain has run into difficulties because 
panamanian authorities have said they will not necessarily accept 
any agreement he makes with us prosecutors 
the attorney said he could not reach an agreement with federal 
prosecutors only to have the panamanians in their zeal seek to 
extradite him 
del cid a former top aide to noriega is considered the 
highestranking defendant in custody after the former panamanian 
leader himself 
noriega del cid and pardo are among 16 people indicted in miami 
in february 1988 on charges of taking part in a conspiracy that 
made panama a way station and processing center for colombias 
medellin drug cartel 
pardo and codefendant daniel miranda flew a lear jet fitted 
with secret compartments to hide the money sullivan told the court 
in february 
pardo received 40000 for the flight and knew it was drug 
money the prosecutor said 
if pardo testifies for the prosecution the defendant most 
immediately threatened by pardo would appear to be miranda 
mirandas attorney michael okane has said his client didnt 
know the money came from drugs and that pardos guilty plea didnt 
necessarily implicate his client 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from the 
cartel the panamanian leader surrendered to us troops after the 
invasion of his country 
he and three of the other defendants are being held in the 
metropolitan correctional center south of miami miranda and brian 
alden davidow are out on bond

president bush completing a series of 
presummit meetins with allied leaders said thursday a united 
germany must exercise full control over its territory and not be 
singled out by the soviet union for special status 
bush commenting after a meeting with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl voiced strong opposition to a soviet proposal that a 
reunified germany be neutral or a member of both nato and the 
warsaw pact 
kohl too said firmly that such matters were up to germany 
alone and he said his nations choice is and will always be 
nato 
it was bushs final meeting with western leaders in advance of 
his may 31june 3 summit with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in recent weeks bush also met with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher french president francois mitterrand and 
canadian president brian mulroney 
the issue of german reunification is expected to be high on the 
agenda at the bushgorbachev talks 
fortyfive years after the end of the war there is no reason 
that a unified democratic germany should be in any way singled out 
for some special status bush said outside the white house as he 
bade farewell to kohl 
for his part kohl thanked bush for the magnificent support 
he had given germans on our path to german unity 
in their formal remarks neither bush nor kohl mentioned the 
delicate question of the pace of german reunification 
at picturetaking session in the oval office kohl would not 
predict whether german unity would come before the end of the year 
even though earlier he suggested allgerman elections could come 
as early as dec 2 
nobody knows that we know that the people are shouting we 
are the people this is why nobody can fix an exact date but 
everythings going very well we can say that he said through a 
translator 
losses by kohls christian democratic party in two west german 
state elections on sunday have seen as a reflection of voter 
uneasiness over his plans for speedy reunification 
bush administration officials say question of how quickly 
reunification proceeds is a matter to be left strictly up to the 
germans 
bush said that he and kohl both agreed that the rights of the 
four world war ii victors the united states the soviet union 
france and britain should be terminated at the time of german 
reunification 
a united germany should have full control over all of its 
territory without any new discriminatory constraints on german 
sovereignty bush said 
britain france and the united states support west germanys 
call for a reunified germany to be part of nato but the soviet 
union argues that the new germany should be neutral or a member of 
both nato and the warsaw pact 
both the united states and west germany want a united germany 
which enjoys full sovereignty a united germany which is a full 
member of the western community and of the nato alliance including 
participation in its integrated military structures bush said 
a senior administration official insisting upon anonymity said 
of the west germans at a white house briefing after the kohl visit 
its absolutely critical that we keep in the closest possible 
touch with them and that was what this meeting was about 
especially immediately in advance of a ussoviet summit in which 
the future of germany will figure prominently 
in his remarks on the south lawn of the white house bush said 
he and kohl agreed that us forces should remain stationed in 
the united germany and elsewhere in europe to continue to promote 
stability and security 
kohl said a reunified germany must remain a member of nato but 
he urged that the alliance concentrate more in the future on its 
political role rather than its military one 
as the threat is decreasing appreciably the alliance must 
keep the initiative in the field of disarmament and arms control 
and review its strategy and structure accordingly he said 
he said at a news conference later we do not want a future 
germany to have a diminished sovereignty we do not want any 
singularization neutralization or demilitarization of germany we 
do not want a united germany to be nonaligned to drift between the 
two camps 
bush and kohl met privately for an hour then for another two 
and a half hours with aides 
during the oval office picturetaking session kohl praised bush 
i think its been rare to find a president in the history of 
the united states who knows german history and german politics so 
well as this president and european politics he said 
and that of course is a lucky thing for us and i think that 
you should write that kohl told reporters 
so do i bush chimed in 
bush and kohl also discussed arms control troops in europe and 
the situation in the rebellious soviet republics of lithuania 
estonia and latvia aides said

more agent orange was sprayed in vietnam than 
official records show a former commander said in a report thursday 
that also suggests a discernible pattern if not collaboration 
to deny veterans compensation 
also a veterans affairs department panel issued a ruling that 
brings compensation closer to veterans exposed to the herbicide who 
suffer from softtissue sarcoma a rare cancer 
admiral elmo r zumwalt jr in his report to veterans secretary 
edward j derwinski said he was certain from his experience that 
more agent orange was spread than recorded 
combat units frequently conducted unofficial sprayings 
of agent orange obtained from out of channel and thus unrecorded 
sources said zumwalt 
additionally as commander us naval forces vietnam i was 
aware that agent orange issued to allied forces was frequently used 
on unrecorded missions zumwalt said in the report 
the report issued may 6 was released thursday a day after 
zumwalt told an advisory panel to the va he believes that 28 
diseases are linked to agent orange exposure zumwalt a special 
adviser to derwinski was recently named to the departments 
advisory committee on environmental hazards 
the panel on thursday determined it is as likely as not that a 
significant association exists between softtissue sarcoma and 
agent orange exposure 
derwinski is to decide by june whether to award disability 
payments to veterans with that disease derwinski decided in march 
that all vietnam veterans with nonhodgkins lymphoma should be 
compensated 
the advisory committee in august will examine studies relating 
dioxin and herbicide exposure to a skin disease known as chloracne 
and a metabolic disorder known as porphyrea cutanea tarda 
the two reports make it likely that veterans will be compensated 
for softtissue sarcoma va spokesman bonner day said the 
department had no figure on how many agent orange claimants said 
they have softtissue sarcoma 
zumwalts report said the herbicide was used in strengths far in 
excess of that suggested by the manufacturers the makers have 
settled a classaction lawsuit brought by afflicted veterans 
he also criticizes government actions and studies on agent 
orange including the activities of the advisory panel 
his broadsides backed up claims by veterans who have been trying 
to get compensation for more than a decade and who claim the 
government has had to be pushed to move and has ignored evidence 
supporting links between agent orange and cancers 
were the faulty conclusions faulty methodology and noticeable 
bias of the advisory committee an isolated problem correcting the 
misdirection would be more manageable zumwalt wrote 
but experience with other governmental agencies responsible 
for analyzing and studying the effects of exposure to agent 
orange strongly hints at a discernible pattern if not outright 
governmental collaboration to deny compensation to vietnam 
veterans for disabilities associated with exposure to dioxin 
committee chairman oliver meadows said he would not comment on 
the zumwalt report 
zumwalt ordered the spraying of the defoliant in vietnam and 
lost a son a vietnam veteran to a cancer linked to agent orange 
exposure 
about 12 million gallons of the herbicide which contained 
cancercausing dioxin was sprayed from 1965 to 1970 according to 
records 
zumwalt said however a significant if not major source of 
exposure was from nonrecorded nonranch hand operations ranch 
hand was the name for the aircraft spraying operation 
evidence readily suggests that at the time experts knew that 
agent orange was harmful to military personnel he said 
zumwalt said that in addition to removing enemy cover and 
destroying crops the herbicide was sprayed to clear vegetation 
around military installations landing zones fire base camps and 
trails

sens edward kennedy and paul simon introduced 
a bill thursday that would grant statehood to the district of 
columbia beginning what kennedy predicted would be a difficult 
uphill struggle 
the measure we are introducing is not new but it is 
overdue said kennedy a massachusetts democrat who backed two 
previous statehood bills that died without votes being taken 
no one doubts this will be a difficult uphill struggle but we 
are committed to the effort he said 
jesse jackson an ardent advocate of statehood joined kennedy 
and simon an illinois democrat at a news conference announcing 
the bill 
mayor marion barry did not attend barry is scheduled to go on 
trial next month on charges of drug possession and perjury 
kennedy referring to president bushs recent suggestion that 
the city could be given the compromise benefit of voting rights in 
congress said statehood was the only acceptable goal 
partway measures and halfhearted initiatives do not satisfy 
the basic principle of selfdetermination kennedy said the 
people of the district of columbia deserve their full rights 
del walter fauntroy who has introduced similar legislation in 
the house said the citys negative image would hurt the statehood 
drive 
many members are concerned about letters they are receiving 
complaining about the mayor and the crime rate fauntroy said 
but they will not be an insurmountable obstacle

about 70000 backers of interim 
president ion iliescu rallied thursday on the last official day of 
the election campaign but tens of thousands of demonstrators 
elsewhere branded him a neocommunist 
the proiliescu crowd some chanting we love you iliescu 
massed in north bucharest they heard their candidate pledge to 
keep romania democratic 
an estimated 30000 antiiliescu demonstrators converged on 
university square in downtown bucharest it was the largest crowd 
yet in a demonstration that has blocked the square and the 
capitals main central thoroughfare 24 hours a day since april 22 
however a feared mass confrontation between the two groups did 
not materialize 
police quickly broke up fistfights among about a dozen people 
from the rival groups one government backer was detained 
iliescu and his national salvation front have dominated the 
government since the december revolution that deposed communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu they are heavily favored in sundays 
presidential and parliamentary elections romanias first free poll 
in 53 years 
iliescu and two challengers for the presidency the national 
liberal partys radu campeanu and the national peasants partys ion 
ratiu held the nations firstever televised debate between 
presidential candidates thursday night 
the two opposition candidates repeated their charges that the 
front was responsible for violence that has plagued their 
campaigns the peasants party claims 60 attacks against its 
supporters including two fatal assaults 
iliescu said it was inconceivable that the front which led 
the government charged with maintaining a peaceful campaign would 
also disrupt it 
asked about the possibility of a coalition government after the 
elections iliescu said it was not only possible but necessary 
campeanu called it a logical idea 
the debate failed to generate heated exchanges between the 
candidates who repeated campaign speeches they used in previous 
weeks 
addressing his supporters earlier thursday at aviators square 
in north bucharest iliescu pledged to guarantee the future of 
democracy in romania 
the stage was surrounded by scores of guards who were barely 
able to keep the boisterous demonstrators from rushing the stage as 
they sang may ratiu and campeanu die of sorrow 
in five short months we have presented a solid record of 
achievement declared premier petre roman flashing the v 
sign that has become his trademark 
the capitals antigovernment protestors were joined by groups 
of students from western timisoara and other cities timisoara is 
where the december revolution began 
the antigovernment demonstrators who paralyzed traffic in the 
capital vowed to stay put until election day despite a ban on 
political rallies friday and saturday 
last saturday iliescu said the square should be cleaned out 
after thursday but roman said wednesday the government had decided 
to allow the demonstrators to remain to avoid a provocation 
the demonstrators charge that iliescu and the front still harbor 
communist and totalitarian tendencies iliescu and some other 
members of the front once held positions in the toppled communist 
regime 
the opposition backers also accuse the front of manipulating 
staterun media to its political advantage

it doesnt think like c3po or r2d2 but this 
robot can amble along the rocky surfaces of mars or the moon as 
well as any star wars machine did in a galaxy far far away 
scientists at carnegie mellon university unveiled the prototype 
thursday nicknamed the ambler by the team that has been 
working on it since october 1987 the aluminum robot stands 12 feet 
tall and has paired stacks of three legs that enable it to traverse 
uneven terrain 
a walking robot was needed as an alternative to the 
traditional line of wheeled rovers said david b lavery manager 
of the planetary rovers program at the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
what we want to do is demonstrate that legged vehicles 
have an acceptable place he said i think the ambler has 
successfully done that 
william l whittaker one of three carnegie mellon robotics 
experts heading the project said the robot moves like a 
crosscountry skier 
a single leg reaches out in front of the others places itself 
firmly on the ground like a ski pole and then pulls the machine 
forward he said 
robots using ambler technology are slated for use in a series of 
mechanized missions to mars lavery said he estimated walking 
robots could be on the martian surface by the end of the decade 
president bush last week set a deadline of 2019 for americans to 
walk on mars the date is 50 years after neil armstrong michael 
collins and buzz aldrin first landed on the moon 
the ambler which recently took its first steps is one project 
being evaluated by the nasa rovers program lavery said the other 
projects under consideration are all wheeled rovers he said 
the intent for the vehicles is for them to be capable of 
operating on their own with just a very general set of 
directions he said 
that objective has been met in the ambler according to takeo 
kanade whittakers associate 
our goal is basically to demonstrate that actual exploration 
of planets is possible kanade said 
the ambler has the ability to assess its environment make 
decisions move and interact with or manipulate objects he said 
the ambler is one of very few systems that embody all four 
capabilities he said 
kanade who serves as codirector of carnegie mellons robotics 
institute said the ambler prototype will never go into space but 
the robots technology should be ready for space flight within a 
decade 
meantime kanade envisions other uses for the technology 
its not just the very narrow kind of strange applications of 
space exploration it has a very broad impact he said 
independent walking robots designed to adapt to a variety of 
environments could be used for construction projects on the moon 
and to clean up hazardous waste on earth he said 
these machines will have to contend with rugged and soft 
terrain low temperatures high winds dust and equipment 
failure kanade said these are robots that work in 
environments that are not traditionally designed for robots 
the impact of this kind of program is phenomenal 
kanade said the university has spent 45 million in nasa grants 
to develop the ambler

a statement from the palace said the king made the decision on 
the advice of prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai who took 
office last month after a twomonth campaign for greater democracy

million residents a week before leaders of the prodemocracy 
movement formed the government 
chief government spokesman radhey shyam bista said the number of 
prisoners detained under the act was being worked out he 
declined to give a rough estimate 
the prodemocracy movement broke the monarchs 29yearold grip 
on power in nepal previously the cabinet was chosen from a 
partyless national assembly 
onefifth of the assemblys 140 members were nominated by the 
king and political observers say candidates for the other posts 
were screened by the palace before being allowed to stand for 
elections 
the leaders of the prodemocracy movement have promised to hold 
free elections by next april and say they will reform the present 
constitution which gives the king sweeping legislative executive 
and judicial powers

president abdou diouf of senegal said thursday 
people should get rid of the idea that african leaders come to the 
united states begging for money 
that is not my case he told reporters 
he was replying to a questioner who suggested he was leaving 
emptyhanded after talking with president bush and leaders of his 
administration 
diouf asked bush for more help when he visited the white house 
monday white house press secretary marlin fitzwater reported bush 
said he was sympathetic but could not promise anything beyond the 
40 million a year senegal has been getting 
diouf said he came to reaffirm links with the united states the 
world bank and the international monetary fund and he said he had 
ample success and nothing to complain about 
he said it would be better to have more help but it was wrong 
to think that african presidents came to washington just to pack 
their valises with aid 
diouf spoke at length of the monument to be erected at almadies 
africas westernmost point in memory of slaves put aboard ships in 
senegal for sale in north america in past centuries he said the 
statue was not meant to show anger but as a symbol of a common 
desire to end violence and alienation among peoples

secretary of state james a baker iii venturing 
into sensitive presummit diplomacy said thursday he would meet in 
moscow friday with the prime minister of the rebellious soviet 
republic of lithuania 
baker informed soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze of 
the decision as they tried to break a deadlock on arms control 
issues less than two weeks before the washington summit 
there are gaps between us still i cant tell you we are 
going to get there a senior us official said of bakers 
attempt to forge an agreement on nuclear weapons cuts before 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev hold their 
may 31june 3 talks 
bush said wednesday that the soviets action against lithuania 
certainly puts some tension on summit prospects but he also 
said it would not stand in the way of any arms agreement 
gorbachev met thursday with lithuanian prime minister kazimiera 
prunskiene in his first such meeting with a top lithuanian official 
since the baltic republic declared independence 
even so the senior us official insisted the soviets had not 
fulfilled the bush administrations call for them to take part in a 
dialogue with the baltic leaders 
it is not enough simply to talk about a need for dialogue 
the official said you have to do something that makes it happen 
and they are continuing to stick to a position that accepts 
dialogue but only under certain conditions 
mrs prunskiene and other leaders of the republic have said they 
are willing to negotiate everything except their independence 
declaration 
the senior us official said baker who was planning to fly 
home at midday saturday would stay on for further talks with the 
soviets if there was a chance of an accord on nuclear arms control 
he is due to see gorbachev friday 
the work is intense right now said the official who 
briefed reporters under rules guaranteeing him anonymity 
baker told shevardnadze that he would see mrs prunskiene and 
his reaction was a nonreaction the official said 
gorbachev has demanded that lithuania revoke its march 11 
declaration of independence but on thursday asked merely for a 
suspension mrs prunskiene told reporters 
tensions in the baltics and the stalemate on arms control issues 
were hindering bakers effort to set a summit agenda with 
shevardnadze 
but symbolically at least they showed a spirit of cooperation 
shevardnadze took baker on a tour of a russian orthodox church 
complex at zagorsk 45 miles northeast of the capital and to the 
nearby village of radonezh 
the 24car motorcade stopped at the modest home of a 76yearold 
russian woman who engaged baker and shevardnadze in a discussion of 
her pension raised recently from 55 to 70 rubles a month the 
equivalent of about 40 it will be increased shevardnadze 
promised 
another elderly woman wearing a purple scarf told baker the 
village church was closed and we have no place to pray appeals 
to authorities had not succeeded she said 
shevardnadze told baker afterward that the church would be 
reopened a us official said 
when baker arrived in moscow tuesday from washington the 
request from mrs prunskiene for a meeting was given to him by us 
ambassador jack f matlock jr 
we are not seeking to send any message by meeting with her 
the senior us official said it obviously gives us a chance to 
hear more about her concerns 
mrs prunskiene has met in washington with bush still the 
meeting with baker here in moscow amid summit preparations added 
a twist to the situation 
baker has already informed the soviets that failure to resolve 
the dispute with the baltics could interfere with an improvement in 
ussoviet relations at the summit 
on the arms control front meanwhile baker said thursday he had 
not made much headway in bending the soviet union to us positions 
on strategic weapons cuts 
but baker said he was still hopeful he and shevardnadze met 
twice during the day for 45 minutes in the morning and for nearly 
five hours after their sightseeing venture 
bakers main goal is to bring the soviets in line with the 
united states on air and sealaunched cruise missiles that would 
break a stalemate and clear the way for a declaration at the 
superpower summit in washington in two weeks 
asked if he had made headway baker told reporters no not a 
lot 
but later leaving the trinity monastery in zagorsk a monument 
to medieval russia baker was a bit more upbeat we hope weve 
made some progress well know more when we get back he said 
the tour of the center of russian orthodoxy was arranged by 
shevardnadze to give baker some flavor of life outside moscow 
the church even in stricter times has enjoyed special 
privileges in a state that theoretically at least is atheistic 
baker and shevardnadze met with church leaders examined ornate 
icons and weaved their way past mostly elderly women saying their 
prayers and lighting candles 
while they motored back gennady gerasimov the spokesman for 
the soviet foreign ministry held a briefing in which he 
sidestepped questions about possible compromises in the us and 
soviet positions 
still gerasimov to illustrate soviet determination to reach an 
agreement quoted shevardnadze as jokingly telling his arms control 
negotiators if you dont agree you will be fired

an estimated 150000 government 
employees returned to work thursday ending a weeklong strike that 
savaged nicaraguas already crippled economy and hamstrung the new 
usbacked administration 
the huge walkouts were a victory for the leftist sandinista 
national liberation front which engineered the strikes beginning 
friday to press for job security and big pay increases 
the 3weekold government of president violeta barrios de 
chamorro promised not to fire those who walked off their jobs and 
agreed to double salaries for the public employees as part of the 
strike settlement 
that was about half what the sandinistadominated unions 
originally asked but higher than the 60 percent mrs chamorro 
initially offered 
she has devalued the cordoba nicaraguas currency four times 
since she took office april 25 inflation however is averaging 70 
percent monthly in effect steadily reducing the real wages of 
workers in this nation of 35 million residents 
everything is returning to normal employees at the banking 
system cleared out the offices they had occupied and those at the 
ministries are following suit presidential spokesman danilo 
lacayo said in a telephone interview 
the international airport reopened and the bus system was 
getting back into gear 
in washington president bush complained that a procedural 
deadlock in congress was holding up a 300 million aid package for 
nicaragua and that he could not disburse 40 million in emergency 
help requested by mrs chamorro until the package is approved 
alejandro solorzano a labor leader who supports mrs chamorro 
said the strike more resembled an attempt by the sandinistas to 
bring down the new government than a job action 
the strike was managed directly by a few leaders of the 
sandinista front it was an attempted coup carried out by 
adventurers and holdup men who checkmated the government 
solorzano said the government will have to strengthen itself to 
prevent another coup attempt by the sandinistas 
solorzano is secretarygeneral of the federation of independent 
workers a branch of the socialist party that forms part of mrs 
chamorros coalition 
barricada the sandinista party newspaper ran an editorial 
calling the strike a triumph for the workers and for democracy 
an attempt to overrun legality and flirting with 
totalitarianism almost set off a blood bath in the country and the 
conflict would have been aggravated if the government had resorted 
to repressive force it said 
the strike in central americas largest country had been stepped 
up daily since may 10 central bank president francisco mayorga 
estimated it cost the government 10 million in lost production and 
revenues 
the government budget had planned for eventual raises similar to 
those granted but because of the strike they had to be granted 
sooner than planned mayorga said 
the banker said nicaragua is counting on the conference of 
donors for help the organization of industrialized mostly 
european nations aids third world nations it meets in rome june 
67 
the countrys cash crisis was deepened by us failure to 
provide the emergency aid mrs chamorro asked 
the chamorro administration inherited from the sandinistas a 
paltry 3 million in cash at the treasury and a foreign debt of 11 
billion 
inflation is chronic prices for consumer goods and services 
have been skyrocketing changing in some cases daily public 
employees earn from as little as 10 to 12 a month for a cleaning 
woman to 350 a month for the deputy manager of a stateoperated 
bank 
us officials said meanwhile the administration was getting 
ready to provide a months worth of food for 14000 rebels whose 
supplies are running out taking 1 million to 15 million from 
aid programs to other countries 
the united states supported the rebels known as contras in 
their guerrilla war against the former sandinista government which 
came to power in 1979 
despite a plan to gradually disband the rebels hostility 
remains strong between the sandinistas and the contras after 10 
years of warfare nicaraguan and us officials are worried about 
renewed conflict if the rebels leave the safety of security zones 
set up for them 
mrs chamorro overwhelmingly won elections on feb 25 for a 
sixyear term but her united national opposition a 14party 
coalition is fragmented and ranges from communists to hardline 
conservatives 
former president daniel ortegas sandinistas with 40 percent of 
the vote remain nicaraguas largest single party ortega said the 
sandinistas will continue to govern from below 
the sandinista insist that the contras disband by june 10 as 
they promised ortegas people continue their control of the 
military and demand that mrs chamorro not touch their 
revolutionary reforms

under the glare of ballpark lights a naked man and towelclad 
woman framed in the window of their darkened hotel room above the

i never suspected in my wildest dreams that someone would be 
doing it right in front of the window said jays president paul

we would take the position that it is a public place and that 
such behavior should not be condoned beeston said 
skydome spokesman david garrick said the couple should have been 
charged 
but police det paul feeney said that before a charge of public 
indecency can be laid there has to be evidence of intent to offend 
in this case they could argue that there was a reasonable 
expectation of privacy said feeney 
six weeks ago a man who was caught performing an indecent act 
in front of a window at the hotel wasnt charged because he thought 
it was oneway glass and that he couldnt be seen 
how our guests behave behind closed doors unless they are

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met with the 
lithuanian prime minister on thursday in a major breakthrough in 
the baltic secession struggle but he demanded the breakaway 
republic make further concessions 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said they met for 
one hour and 40 minutes in the kremlin and that gorbachev told her 
the fact that we are meeting means we have moved from our initial 
positions and this is a big step forward 
she told reporters the discussion was difficult at first 
but improved as it went along though complete agreement was not 
reached 
gorbachev had refused to meet with the secessionist leaders of 
the three baltics republics and earlier in the day accused them of 
adventurism 
the kremlin meeting set by gorbachev in a telephone call to 
mrs prunskiene shortly after she arrived at lithuanias mission in 
moscow broke the deadlock between moscow and lithuania over 
lithuanias declaration of independence on march 11 
soviet authorities forcibly annexed lithuania and its sister 
republics of estonia and latvia in 1940 and all three have 
declared moves toward independence this year 
us secretary of state james a baker iii who had said that 
the baltic impasse was casting a shadow over the may 30june 3 
superpower summit in washington told reporters he would meet with 
mrs prunskiene on friday president bush received her at the white 
house earlier this month 
gorbachev first demanded that lithuania rescind its declaration 
but on thursday merely called for a suspension 
the lithuanian parliament has balked at revoking the declaration 
but on wednesday voted to suspend postindependence laws if the 
kremlin will open talks on independence 
a compromise appeared to be emerging along the lines of a 
formula proposed last month by president francois mitterrand of 
france and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
in addition to suspending certain laws lithuanian concessions 
add a transition period before full independence and make concrete 
proposals on military cooperation economic plans and other topics 
mrs prunskiene said lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis 
would call the supreme council parliament into session on saturday 
to formalize the offer she said if moscow finds parliaments 
action acceptable the two sides could select negotiating teams 
this does not mean we are returning to the situation of march 
10 she told reporters underlining lithuanias determination to 
strive for independence 
at the meeting gorbachev and prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
told mrs prunskiene the lithuanian concessions did not meet their 
demand to suspend the lithuanian declaration of independence the 
official tass news agency reported 
k prunskienes attention was drawn to the indispensable 
necessity that the lithuanian supreme soviet cancel or at a 
minimum suspend this act and all the legislative measures 
following it that contradict the soviet constitution tass 
reported 
the leaders told mrs prunskiene that concession was the only 
way to launch negotiations the report said 
but tass said the leaders noted that the lithuanian offer showed 
certain steps had been made toward the normalization of the 
situation 
prunskiene called the meeting an introduction to coming 
negotiations said longinas vasiliauskas press attache of the 
lithuanian representation in moscow 
earlier thursday gorbachev lashed out at what he called the 
adventurism of baltic independence leaders 
a constructive approach is needed we will not permit any 
violation of the constitution or any division from the 
constitutional process gorbachev told britains channel 4 
television at a moscow parliamentary meeting 
i believe that the lithuanian leadership and some others 
cannot get rid of adventurism he said in a separate session with 
foreign journalists 
mrs prunskiene came to the soviet capital thursday evening she 
said her republic of 38 million people was willing to make another 
major concession agreeing to remain part of the soviet security 
system 
concessions approved by the lithuanian parliament wednesday 
would stop unilateral action for realizing the declaration of 
independence for the lithunian government especially in those 
spheres most important to the soviet union most of all defense 
and borders she told reporters 
but she said lithuania would stand fast on the declaration 
itself the declaration of independence is active and is not a 
subject for discussion or negotiations she said 
gorbachev has rejected lithuanias declaration of independence 
and attempts at more gradual secession by estonia and latvia he 
imposed an oil and natural gas embargo and other ecomomic sanctions 
on lithuania causing some businesses there to close and thousands 
of workers to be laid off 
soviet military officials are concerned by the refusal of 
lithuanian youths to serve in the soviet armed forces and by 
prospects they would lose access to the baltic ports of klaipeda 
and kaliningrad accessible by land only across lithuanian 
territory 
mrs prunskiene said the military compromise would involve 
participation of lithuania in the defense system of the soviet 
union she gave no details 
mrs prunskiene said negotiators must resolve hundreds of issues 
before a final deal is cut with moscow 
latvian deputy prime minister ilmars bisers said wednesday that 
talks on baltic independence would start next week with midlevel 
kremlin officials he said talks with soviet officials would focus 
on the gaining of independence on the basis of a treaty with the 
soviet union

the leader of chinas communist party says the 
wests anger over last years crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in his country was much ado about nothing 
jiang zemin also told abctvs 2020 program that he had no 
regrets about the way the june demonstrations in beijings 
tiananmen square were handled troops opened fire killing hundreds 
of protesters 
but he told barbara walters chinese leaders learn by our 
mistakes so similar demonstrations may be handled with nonlethal 
force 
we have made adequate preparations in terms of strengthening 
the police force and storing of nonlethal weapons he said in 
this regard im ready to learn from all the developed western 
countries 
the interview to be aired friday night is apparently the first 
jiang has granted a foreign television reporter since he was named 
general secretary of the communist party in june after the 
tiananmen square crackdown jiang also hold his governments top 
two military posts 
he replaced zhao ziyang who was deposed for supporting the 
prodemocracy movement and was the handpicked successor of the 
countrys supreme leader deng xiaoping who resigned last year from 
all his official posts at the age of 84 
jiang agreed to the interview as the bush administration neared 
a deadline on deciding whether to extend trade concessions to china 
president bush who suspended military cooperation with china to 
protest tiananmen has until june 3 to decide whether to extend 
chinas mostfavorednation status by one year the status granted 
to most us trading partners reduces tariffs significantly on 
imports 
bush told reporters wednesday that while he didnt want to send 
a signal to beijing that he approves of the governments human 
rights record removing mostfavorednation status would adversely 
affect hong kong the british colony that funnels 70 percent of 
chinas exports to the united states 
jiang warned that revoking chinas trade concessions would 
work against the interests of our two countries and those of 
the entire southeast asian region 
i hope that the us government would consider this matter 
from a longterm perspective he said 
jiang said that after last years demonstrations there was 
some kind of misunderstanding lack of understanding or even 
notsofriendly attitudes toward china 
therefore to give you a chinese proverb i would say its 
like much ado about nothing he said 
in a rare glimpse of the internal workings of chinas secretive 
leadership jiang said there were different opinions within the 
top chinese leadership and that was the crucial point in the 
decision to resort to lethal force to quell the protest 
jiang said that if at the start of the student unrest in april 
1989 we adopted resolute measures for example by declaring a 
ban on assembly in tiananmen square then it would have been easier 
for us to deal with the problem at a later stage 
as mayor of shanghai at the time jiang said he had dealt with 
protesters there by persuasion rather than force 
jiang said no protesters were executed as a direct result of the 
tiananmen events chinas official press reported 20 executions 
he said 431 people including 42 students were still in 
detention according to unofficial estimates 10000 to 15000 
people were detained after the protests china announced last week 
that it had released 211 prisoners including several prominent 
academics 
jiang said that despite the fall of communism in eastern europe 
china would not tolerate any opposition to socialism and would 
combat bourgeois liberalization but he added china is not 
opposed to everything about capitalism 
we want to learn from the knowhow and even buy knowhow from 
western countries he said

a tax fraud indictment against leona helmsley 
was gutted thursday by a judge who said state prosecutors were 
putting the selfstyled hotel queen in double jeopardy 
state supreme court justice john bradley said he dropped 180 of 
the 188 counts in the indictment because they are similar to those 
on which mrs helmsley was tried in federal court last august 
the court threw out the heart and soul of the states case 
said alan dershowitz lead lawyer of mrs helmsleys legal team 
new evidence will demonstrate that mrs helmsley did not evade 
taxes 
im very happy mrs helmsley 70 said tearfully as she 
left court after hearing bradleys ruling she suggested that the 
case against her was brought only because of her prominence 
theyre after my hide she said im leona helmsley 
i hold my head high because i know that i am an innocent 
person falsely accused and terribly maligned she said 
the federal case related solely to dunellen hall the helmsleys 
mansion in greenwich conn the helmsleys were charged with 
furnishing renovating and operating the estate by charging its 
expenses to their businesses 
mrs helmsley was sentenced to four years in prison and fined 
71 million in the federal case she is appealing the conviction 
and sentence maintaining that she in fact overpaid her taxes 
her husband real estate billionaire harry helmsley 80 was 
found incompetent to stand trial in the federal case he is trying 
to avoid a state trial on on similar grounds 
he has been examined by a psychiatrist according to leslie 
gersing of the state attorney generals office and a hearing on 
the exam results is scheduled for may 23 before bradley 
the dropped charges are counts of conspiracy offering a false 
instrument for filing falsifying business records and scheme to 
defraud all of which relate to dunellen hall and were dealt with 
in the federal case 
the state charges involved dunellen hall as well as a 
condominium in north hills ny and the park lane hotel the 
helmsleys new york city home 
the judge let stand the eight counts that did not involve the 
connecticut estate he noted that the alleged state tax fraud 
conspiracy preceded and outlasted the federal conspiracy 
bradley refused a defense request to dismiss the remaining eight 
charges in the interest of justice he said the impact of such 
an act on public confidence would be devastating 
the charges that remain are counts of offering a false 
instrument for filing a felony each count is punishable by up to 
four years in prison 
gersing the state attorney generals spokeswoman said one of 
the eight charges relate to mrs helmsleys personal taxes and the 
others involve helmsley businesses she observed that bradley 
dismissed the charges on principles of law not on the merits of 
the allegations 
gersing said prosecutors were studying the bradley decision and 
had not decided whether to appeal

an israeli defense official said thursday that 
israel is seeking proof a lebanese shiite militia is holding the 
bodies of two israeli soldiers before considering swapping moslem 
prisoners for the remains 
such an exchange with the mainstream amal militia could 
encourage more releases of western hostages held in lebanon by 
proiranian radicals there are now 16 western hostages including 
six americans 
the israeli official who conveyed an official position though 
he spoke on condition of anonymity was reacting to an amal 
proposal reported by the beirut daily al anwar on may 12 
according to the report amal was ready to hand over the bodies 
of two israeli servicemen killed in south lebanon in exchange for 
the release of shiite prisoners 
after two us hostages were freed last month iran and allied 
groups in lebanon demanded a goodwill gesture such as the release 
of prisoners held by the israelbacked south lebanon army 
the mostly christian 2500member militia holds more than 300 
prisoners at alkhiam prison in south lebanon 
last week south lebanon army commander gen antoine lahad 
rebuffed appeals to make prisoner releases solely to help western 
hostages he said three captured israeli soldiers and missing 
militiamen from his army must be part of any deal 
the israeli official said israel had no information about amal 
holding any bodies of israeli soldiers most of the seven israeli 
servicemen missing in lebanon are believed to be in the hands of 
radical iranianbacked or palestinian groups 
if amal believes the bodies are those of israeli soldiers let 
it first submit evidence to this effect only after we are 
convinced the bodies are in fact those of israeli soldiers will 
there be room to negotiate the matter 
longest held of the 16 western hostages is american terry a

east german prime minister lothar de 
maiziere sought to rein in west germanys push for quick 
unification by cautioning thursday against holding allgerman 
elections too soon 
first we have to clear up the external and internal conditions 
for german unity de maiziere said 
external issues deal notably with the strategic role of a united 
germany 
this is being discussed between the two germanys and the 
victorious world war ii allies france britain the soviet union 
and the united states and must first be satisfactorily sorted 
out de maiziere told reporters 
he spoke at the end of a twoday visit to strasbourg during 
which he addressed members of the european parliament and met with 
senior european community officials 
de maiziere said also to be settled before allgerman elections 
is the status of east germanys treaties and relations with its 
partners in the 10nation moscowled comecon trade bloc 
east germanys path into the european community should not be 
a barrier to relations with eastern europe he said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl has sought to accelerate 
german unification following his partys regional election losses 
last sunday union of the two germanys currency into a powerful 
deutschmark is set for july 2 
kohl said wednesday he wants the twoplusfour talks 
completed by fall and he and his coalition partners want west 
germanys dec 2 elections to become allgerman 
analysts say kohl figures his christian democrats could lose to 
the opposition social democrats if voting was held only in west 
germany but might do better in allgerman elections 
de maiziere also a christian democrat said he wants to wait 
with allgerman elections until all questions about unification 
have been settled 
in another development king michael romanias former monarch 
told members of the european parliament on thursday that sundays 
elections in romania must be postponed because the election 
campaign has been unfair 
after debating the romanian voting campaign the parliament 
adopted a resolution telling romanias ruling national salvation 
front to end their campaign of intimidation 
romanians vote for a twochamber parliament in their first free 
elections in 50 years political experts predict the front will win 
60 percent of the vote 
the front has led romania since the december ouster and 
execution of communist dictator nicolae ceausescu it is said to 
shelter former members of ceausescus secret police the election 
campaign has been marred by violence and charges that the front has 
been intimidating opponents 
michael who abdicated and left romania in 1947 said thursday 
there can be no real democracy in a country where the 
government accuses the opposition of destabilizing the state 
where peaceful demonstrators are called a bunch of hooligans 
where the opposition cannot take public opinion polls where 
candidates are regularly beaten intimidated persecuted and where 
television is a propaganda instrument used by the authorities 
the former monarch who lives in switzerland enjoys 
considerable popularity in romania 
in another resolution thursday the european parliament 
unanimously asked the soviet union to reopen the case of swedish 
diplomat raoul wallenberg who saved hundreds of jews in hungary 
during world war ii wallenberg was arrested by soviet troops in 
1945 and vanished 
the soviets have claimed wallenberg died in 1947 but witnesses 
said they saw him alive after this date

president bush said thursday he wont tolerate 
bias in hiring but also wont accept a civil rights bill that 
imposes quotas on employers 
sens edward m kennedy dmass and john danforth rmo 
quickly unveiled a compromise amendment intended to deal with his 
objections to the bill that is at the top of many civil rights 
organizations legislative lists for this year 
but the white house and sen orrin hatch rutah both said it 
failed to remove their concerns about quotas 
i want to sign a civil rights bill but i will not sign a 
quota bill bush declared at a rose garden ceremony honoring the 
recently revived us commission on civil rights 
the president who met three times earlier this week with civil 
rights groups and other lobbyists to search for a compromise on the 
legislation said before kennedy and danforth announced their new 
proposal i think we can work it out 
after unveiling the amended version danforth said after 
weeks of negotiating over this change we are now convinced that 
quotas will not be the unintended result of this bill danforth 
signed with five other senators as the newest sponsors of the bill 
which now has 47 sponsors in the 100member senate 
but hatch said later the kennedydanforth amendment in no way 
solves the severe quota problem in the bill hatch the top 
republican on kennedys labor and human resources committee said 
bush and his advisers were too smart to be taken in by this new 
language 
at the white house deputy press secretary alixe glen said 
its a step in the right direction but it still does not 
eliminate our concern that employers would adopt quotas 
there is no mention of quotas the hiring of a certain number 
or percentage of minority or other workers in the bill but 
attorney general dick thornburgh and other critics have said the 
earlier versions standard of proof for justifying exclusionary 
hiring practices was so tough that employers would use quotas as a 
way of avoiding lawsuits 
the legislation would undo a series of 1989 supreme court 
decisions that made it harder for workers to prove they were 
victims of job discrimination 
we will leave nothing to chance and no stone unturned as we 
work to advance americas civil rights agenda bush said to 
applause from the audience that included many civil rights leaders 
we can and will make america open and equal to all bush 
said we will tolerate no barriers no bias no inside tracks no 
twotiered system and no rungless ladders 
last month thornburgh said he might recommend a veto of the 
pending bill which is at the top of many civil rights 
organizations legislative lists for this year 
but after bushs comments thursday benjamin hooks jr 
executive director of the naacp called it a very happy day 
hooks said bush had moved right into the mainstream on the 
civil rights legislation although a little conflict still 
remains 
bush said that the law must obliterate consideration of 
race color religion sex or national origin from hiring must 
protect against harassment in the workplace based on race sex 
religion or disability and should ensure a speedy end to such 
discriminatory practices 
our civil rights laws however should not be turned into some 
lawyers bonanza encouraging litigation at the expense of 
conciliation mediation or settlement the president said 
the legislation would undo a supreme court decision that 
narrowed the ability of minorities to win monetary damages for job 
discrimination and would restore the burden of proof to defendants 
in cases where hiring practices allegedly had a discriminatory 
impact 
for 18 years employers had the burden of proving a business 
necessity for any exclusionary hiring practices the supreme court 
altered that in the 1989 wards cove case involving hiring at an 
alaskan salmon cannery 
the original senate bill said employers would have to prove 
discrimination was essential to job performance the new version 
would require only proof that such practices had a substantial 
and demonstrable relationship to effective job performance 
a similar change was made in the house version recently 
bush also named charles pei wang a new yorker who is president 
of the china institute in america to the civil rights commission

housesenate negotiators smoothed the way for 
passage of a 720 million central american aid bill thursday by 
dropping controversial measures on abortions and the death penalty 
in the district of columbia 
president bush threatened to veto the supplemental 
appropriations bill if it included the democratic proposal to allow 
the district to use locally raised tax money for abortions for 
impoverished women 
negotiators also jettisoned a companion measure pushed by 
republicans that would have permitted the death penalty in 
nations capital 
sen brock adams dwash said proponents of the abortion 
financing measure abandoned it because they didnt want to threaten 
the total money bill but he vowed to bring the measure up again in 
the senate 
we will be back to pass prochoice legislation he said 
weve got the votes 
negotiators cleared the abortion hurdle and made progress in 
other areas but they didnt finish work on the 1990 supplemental 
appropriations bill the money bill loaded with porkbarrel items 
and extraneous provisions totals about 33 billion still to be 
worked out are differences on defense spending 
key provisions in the measure are the 300 million in aid for 
nicaragua and 420 million for panama bush chided congress this 
week for dallying on the central american aid measure 
nicaraguan president violeta chamorro urgently needs the money 
because her country is bankrupt and is rocked with by 
antigovernment strikes bush said 
about 14000 nicaraguan contras are staying in camps under a 
un supervised peace agreement reached with mrs chamorro after 
she defeated sandinista president daniel ortega 
the bush administration worried the rebels might run out of 
food is expected to take between 1 million and 15 million from 
aid programs to other countries to help feed the contras said us 
officials who asked not to be identified 
even former house speaker jim wright of texas joined the chorus 
calling for quick approval of money for central america 
in my considered view it is extremely important for congress 
to move as swiftly as possible to approve president bushs 
emergency request for 720 million in desperately needed economic 
aid to panama and nicaragua he said 
once negotiators have reached final agreement the package must 
be approved by the full house and senate money wont be spent to 
central america until an authorization bill is passed by the house 
debate is set for monday 
the 1990 bill contains a host of bigticket items including 
110 million for the census about 162 million for the head start 
program for poor children 400 million in housing loans for israel 
to build houses for soviet emigres a total of 45 million for peru 
and bolivia 705 million for the agriculture departments food 
stamp program 10 million for natural disasters 5 million for 
children in cambodia and roughly 60 million for flood control 
lawmakers removed a proposed 10 million for a us embassy in 
lithuania 
there was friction between the house and some senators over the 
amount of free mail house members have sent this year 
the house postage account will be about 44 million in the red 
by the end of the year lawmakers said 
rep vic fazio dcalif asked and senators conditionally 
agreed to let the house use 25 million in unspent funds from an 
operations fund to help make up the postage deficit 
it now appears the house is going to spend twice as much 
money on mail as planned said sen don nickles rokla 
controversy has been brewing on the house mailings for some 
time and fazio told senators the house intends to take up proposed 
reforms 
the house administration committee said one reason for the 
largerthanexpected deficit will be increased firstclass mailings 
close to election day 
many members will turn to first class at 25 cents per piece 
because they will have used up the three thirdclass bulk mailings 
at 10 cents each allowed under the law officials said

the liberal autonomyminded 
republics of croatia and slovenia on thursday rejected a threat 
from the federal presidency of urgent measures to save 
communist rule and restore yugoslavias disintegrating unity 
slovenia said it would use all legal means to preserve its 
sovereignty 
on wednesday slovenia installed the countrys first 
noncommunist regional government in nearly 50 years northern 
neighbor croatia also held multiparty elections and is expected to 
install a centerright government at the end of may both governing 
parties want more regional autonomy 
thursdays rejection seemed certain to aggravate their deep 
split with the largest of yugoslavias six republics serbia the 
only yugoslav republic that has not scheduled multiparty elections 
yugoslavias eightmember collective presidency headed by 
borisav jovic a serb said wednesday the political and security 
situation is so unstable that yugoslavia is currently going 
through its most critical phase 
jovic announced introduction of unspecified urgent measures 
to protect national integrity 
political ethnic and economic differences have fueled a long 
row among the regions and within the disintegrating communist party 
the battle for power in the vacuum left by the 1980 death of 
communist yugoslavias founder josip tito now seems headed for a 
climax 
jovics remarks set off widespread speculation that martial law 
may be introduced in slovenia and croatia 
the orthodox communist leadership of serbia opposes changes in 
the countrys socialist system it also wants a federal system with 
strong central authority in the serbian and federal capital 
belgrade 
croatia and slovenia say this constitutes an attempt by serbian 
leader slobodan milosevic to retain singleparty rule and ensure 
serbian domination 
slovenias collective presidency denounced jovic on thursday 
saying he had spoken without consulting the republic 
democratic free elections were carried out in slovenia in 
which its citizens expressing their will elected a legitimate 
leadership the slovenian presidency said 
it said the slovenian developments had enhanced peace and 
stability and called for an urgent conference of yugoslav 
republics to chart a new relationship 
in a statement carried by tanjug news agency croatias 
collective presidency said the realization of democratic 
strivings and the expressed will of the citizens of croatia must 
and may not in any way be questioned 
it termed jovics statements arbitrary and unacceptable and 
demanded more details 
yugoslavias communist party and the presidency continue to 
formally run the country on the federal level but the party has 
been effectively paralyzed since last january when slovenian and 
croatian communists broke with hardliners

salvadoran government officials and 
guerrilla representatives negotiated over a proposed ceasefire 
thursday during their second day of peace talks in caracas 
venezuelan sources said 
the talks came after the two sides agreed april 4 in geneva to 
renew efforts to bring an end to their decadelong war more than 
70000 people have been killed 
un envoy alvaro de soto was mediating the caracas talks the 
discussions held in a school in a suburb of the capital were kept 
secret behind a cordon of venezuelan security forces 
however venezuelan sources said on condition of anonymity that 
the discussions centered on a ceasefire which the rightwing 
salvadoran government considers essential to test the guerrillas 
good faith 
the leftist guerrillas have consistently rejected that proposal 
unless the government guarantees to fire elements of the armed 
forces allegedly involved in human rights violations 
the obstacles at the talks were underlined wednesday as 
salvadoran president alfredo christiani sharply criticized the 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front for 
leaking their position to the salvadoran press 
the guerrillas demand a demilitarization of salvadoran society 
full democratization of their country and a national economic pact

negotiators for the white house and congress 
were urged thursday to seek deficit savings of 50 billion to 60 
billion but avoid more drastic steps that might send the economy 
into a slowdown 
officials from the administration and the congressional budget 
office gave the negotiators widely differing projections about the 
size of the growing federal deficit 
but both sides agreed that cuts of 50 billion to 60 billion 
would not be enough to head off automatic spending cuts under the 
grammrudman budget balancing law some negotiators have said 
loosening the deficit targets in the law could be one way of 
dealing with that problem 
were still trying to find out what the facts are house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo said after thursdays 90 
minutes of closeddoor talks 
then well set the goals were trying to achieve then well 
talk about ways to reach the goals 
congressional aides said it was likely to be several days before 
a detailed proposal for spending cuts or tax increases surfaced in 
the talks the meetings began tuesday after president bush set 
aside his campaign pledge of no new taxes and said there would be 
no preconditions to the negotiations 
treasury secretary nicholas brady white house chief of staff 
john sununu and budget director richard darman led the presidents 
team into the negotiations 
participants at the talks heard differing projections about the 
likely size of the 1991 deficit without tax hikes or spending cuts 
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office it 
will take 85 billion to 95 billion in savings to reach the 64 
billion target in the grammrudman law 
the white houses office of management and budget presented 
figures showing that 59 billion to 74 billion would be needed 
but robert reischauer director of the congressional budget 
office and white house budget chief richard darman agreed that to 
cut next years shortfall by more than 50 billion or 60 billion 
about 1 percent of the economy could contribute to an economic 
slowdown 
a leading democratic negotiator concurred it is legitimate to 
ask the question at what point do you begin to undermine the 
economy in terms of too many taxes and too many cuts said rep 
leon panetta 
accepting the lower target presumably would make the work of the 
negotiators easier and lead to less politically painful remedies 
neither agencys figures included the costs of rescuing the 
nations ailing savings and loan industry cbo calculated that when 
those expenses are included the amount of required deficit cuts 
could explode to 132 billion to 182 billion the grammrudman law 
requires that the costs of the savings and loan bailout be included 
in calculations of the deficit 
when bush unveiled his budget in january he said that just 37 
billion in cuts would be needed to satisfy the grammrudman law 
what were seeing today is the administration abandoning their 
rosy scenario said one of the democratic negotiators senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser of tennessee 
darman provided the negotiators with examples of the automatic 
spending cuts the grammrudman law would impose next year if a 
compromise deficitreduction package was not worked out 
he said that if 30 billion in cuts were required defense 
spending would be cut by 76 percent and domestic programs by 104 
percent if 60 billion in reductions were necessary the slice 
would be 152 percent for the military and 222 percent for 
domestic programs 
as examples he said that with 30 billion in grammrudman cuts 
the fbis 14 billion budget would be cut by 81 million the 
federal aviation administrations 65 billion budget would be 
reduced by 126 million and the pentagons 808 billion 
procurement efforts would be cut by 21 billion for technical 
reasons the grammrudman cuts are applied differently to various 
programs 
the talks resumed as democrats questioned bushs willingness to 
embrace politically unpopular spending cuts 
bush has rejected democratic calls for him to take the lead in 
proposing a solution and lawmakers suggested before thursdays 
negotiations began that the president might not be willing to 
accept deep spending cuts 
its premature to know that said gephardt he top 
democratic negotiator 
panetta said he believed bush would be willing to support 
whatever proposal emerges 
but he added theres a lot of skepticism around this place 
whether or not theyll be willing to grab this tar baby in the 
end 
panetta who also is among the negotiators complained that 
partisan dueling is hindering negotiators and could jeopardize the 
talks outcome he said such pressures were likely to grow during 
the course of this election year 
were trying to walk through it and you have the hatfields 
and the mccoys firing shots over our heads he said 
even house speaker thomas s foley dwash who normally avoids 
political fingerpointing was drawn into the fray 
on wednesday rep bill frenzel rminn had said democratic 
calls for bush to make a televised address on the deficit were an 
effort to force him to do a jimmy carter that was a reference 
to the former presidents unpopular penchant of reminding the 
nation of its problems 
asked about the remark foley responded does that mean 
exercising presidential leadership 
the projected size of next years deficit has grown because of 
unexpectedly high interest rates growing costs of handling the 
savings and loan industry collapse and lowerthanexpected tax 
revenues

a maoist rebel faction said thursday it is 
suspending military actions while it reviews its antigovernment 
struggle but it vowed to resume its armed insurgency 
in leaflets found in the andean city of ayacucho on thursday 
the 10th anniversary of the shining path uprising rebels who 
claimed to represent a splinter faction of the group said it will 
lay down arms to evaluate all our brilliant actions of the decade 
and then return with new impulses and ideas 
it said it would take up arms again soon 
the leaflets were found near where a bomb exploded early 
thursday the bombs target the offices of presidential candidate 
alberto fujimoris change 90 party was slightly damaged but no 
one was reported injured 
a survey of limaarea voters released thursday showed fujimori 
trailing novelist mario vargas llosa by nearly 5 percentage points 
in the most recent survey of limaarea voters 
the centerright vargas llosa is favored by 463 percent of 
voters to 417 percent who support the centrist fujimori 
according to a poll of 484 people made last weekend by the private 
firm datum the poll had a 46 percent margin of error 
about onethird of perus 22 million people live in the lima 
area 
the runoff election is set for june 10 vargas llosa narrowly 
won the most votes with fujimori right behind him in last months 
primary but many thought his support had eroded in recent weeks 
the winner must deal with perus poor economic situation and the 
continuing shining path insurgency more than 18000 people have 
been killed in political violence since the shining path took up 
arms 10 years ago 
there have been reports in recent weeks in the lima press of a 
schism within the ayacucho branch of the shining path the andean 
city 235 miles southeast of lima is the movements birthplace and 
remains its stronghold 
however analysts who study the rebel movement say the division 
is unlikely to significantly weaken the guerrillas 
in an indication of divisions within the movement the rebel 
leaflets made no direct mention of the shadowy shining path leader 
abimail guzman instead they called for an end to personality 
cults and ideological fundamentalism 
guzman a former philosophy professor is believed to advocate 
extreme violence 
in past years the rebel group has carried out numerous 
massacres of mountain peasants it viewed as traitors to its cause 
the splinter groups leaflets criticized mass genocides 
especially when they involve workers and peasants it said such 
actions undercut grassroots support

the house approved an amendment thursday 
permitting food service workers with aids to be assigned duties 
that would keep them away from hanbdling food 
by a 199187 vote the house agreed to change the proposed 
americans with disabilities act a bill aimed at protecting the 
rights of the disabled to allow employers to reassign workers with 
contagious diseases so they will not be allowed to handle food 
both sides agreed that contagious disease referred primarily 
to aids which can be spread only by intimate sexual contact or by 
sharing hypodermic needles or blood 
among those voting for the amendment were 79 democrats 
thirtyone republicans opposed it 
the amendment means the bill once it passes the house will 
have to go to a conference committee to work out differences 
backers of the measure had hoped to avoid having to submit the bill 
to such negotiations 
im sure the senate will now ask for a conference because this 
amendment will not be acceptable said rep steny h hoyer 
dmd lead house sponsor hoyer called the provision the jim 
crow amendment of 1990 
the analogy follows repeated descriptions of the bill as the 
most significant piece of civil rights legislation since the 1960s 
the vote was a significant setback in the progress that has 
been made over the past several years in understanding aids said 
spokesman gregory king of the human rights campaign fund a 
gayrights group that lobbied against the amendment 
the bill easily cleared the senate last september on a 768 
vote that bill was the product of delicate negotiations with the 
white house the house version nearly duplicated the senate bill 
the white house had endorsed the bill for its protection of aids 
victims along with other disabled people however its position on 
the amendment whose existence was long known was not clearly 
stated until health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
wrote a letter thursday to house speaker thomas s foley 
food service workers infected with hiv need not be restricted 
from work unless they have other infections or illnesses for which 
any food service worker should be restricted sullivan said 
since the act limits coverage for persons who pose a direct 
threat to others relaxing the antidiscrimination protection for 
food service workers is not needed or justified in terms of the 
protection of the public health 
but the argument boiled down to public fears as opposed to 
scientific evidence 
perception is reality said rep chuck douglas rnh 
arguing that restaurants which let aids victims handle food would 
be driven out of business 
we need to look at reality as it exists today said rep 
steve bartlett rtexas not as we wish it to exist 
in effect it says theres a prejudice out there and lets 
pander to it countered frank mccloskey dind invoking the 
memory of ryan white the indiana youth who recently died as a 
result of aids acquired through a transfusion 
rep henry a waxman dcali said he believed the amendment 
stemmed from misunderstanding of the bill the bill contains a 
provision that exempts any person whose condition or conduct poses 
a direct threat to others 
the bill was hailed during opening debate as legislation whose 
time has come the bill extends to people with aids blindness 
cerebral palsy and a number of other mental and physical 
impairments the protections accorded racial minorities and women 
the house also passed a pair of amendments favoring business 
including one giving small businesses temporary immunity from 
discrimination lawsuits it rejected one giving a paybased formula 
for determining whether businesses have spent enough to accommodate 
disabled employees 
backers say the legislation is necessary to push the estimated 
43 million disabled americans into the economic and social 
mainstream the cost to the government is small topping out at 31 
million in 1994 the cost to business has not been calculated 
supporters say also that the cost will be offset by the addition 
of disabled people to the work force and the consumer economy 
the bill prohibits discrimination in all phases of life 
employment access to stores and services transportation and 
telecommunications 
among key provisions 
discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited 
the requirement would be phased in over two to four years 
depending on the size of the company companies with fewer than 15 
employers would be exempt 
hotels restaurants shopping malls drug stores and business 
and professional offices along with any other public 
accommodation would have to make themselves accessible to 
disabled people accessibility includes structural adjustments 
such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors and services 
transportation public and private would have to be made 
accessible fixed route bus systems would have to be accessible for 
people with wheelchairs special paratransit would be available 
for people with other disabilities who cannot use regular 
transit amtrak greyhound and commuter rail systems are 
covered timetables for implementation vary according to system 
speech and hearingimpaired people would have access to 
telephone service by means of relay services these services would 
have to be provided by phone companies within three years the 
federal communications commission would have jurisdiction

women become priests there are six woman deacons and four in

art buchwald has attacked paramount pictures 
claim that the hit eddie murphy movie coming to america lost 
18 million contending in court papers that the movie actually 
made 398 million 
superior court judge harvey schneider ruled in january that 
paramount must pay buchwald 250000 and 19 percent of the films 
net profits paramount has said it will appeal the decision 
buchwald claimed the studio stole his script idea titled king 
for a day which dealt with an african prince who comes to live 
in the united states the films credits attributed the idea to 
murphy 
in papers filed wednesday the humorists attorney pierce 
odonnell said the share of the net profit due his client and 
producer alan bernheim should range between 69 million and 146 
million 
the studios reaction is that their claims are baseless and 
unfounded said robert schwartz an attorney for paramount 
paramount has claimed it lost 18 million on coming to 
america even though the 1988 film has grossed 275 million 
worldwide 
buchwalds audit which covers the period up to december of last 
year states that producing coming to america cost paramount 
229 million a paramount audit put the figure at 585 million 
papers filed by odonnell said several items that paramount 
listed in the cost of making the movie should not have been 
included 
among them were 1 million for murphys entourage 900000 for 
excessive fringe benefits and a 15 percent overhead charge that 
amounted to 8 million of the costs all by itself 
the brief said 165 million of the 8 million overhead was 
merely for writing gross participation checks to eddie murphy and 
director john landis

east germanys interior minister wants 
to hire former leading communist spy markus wolf as a special 
adviser but angry west german officials said thursday that wolf 
should be prosecuted instead 
wolf 67 was purportedly the role model for the wily communist 
spy karla in john le carres espionage novels 
carldieter spranger parliamentary state secretary in west 
germanys interior ministry said wolf is not acceptable for 
office in a democracy he said east german interior minister 
petermichael diestels idea to hire him is unbearable 
before he retired in 1987 wolf was chief of foreign 
intelligence within communist east germanys ministry for state 
security which also contained the infamous stasi domestic 
secret police 
the ministry was dissolved last year in east germanys quiet 
revolution that ended four decades of hardline communist 
leadership 
during his 33year career wolf earned a reputation in the west 
as one of the craftiest intelligence foes he is wanted by west 
germany 
but wolf was also one of the first senior communist party 
officials to call for democratic changes within his homeland wolf 
last year even joined activists in addressing prodemocracy street 
demonstrators 
in a telefax to western news media diestel defended his plan to 
hire wolf saying he would be invaluable in helping clear up the 
activities of the stasi 
diestel said he wants to ensure that a ministry for state 
security can never arise again and for that reason asked wolf to 
lay open his knowledge and make it available to the new 
government 
eduard lintner a political expert for chancellor helmut kohls 
coalition government urged serious consideration whether diestel 
is still acceptable as interior minister or must be let go

us and philippine negotiators met 
friday for a fifth day of talks on the future of american bases in 
the philippines after a latenight marathon session failed to 
produce a breakthrough 
early friday unknown assailants fired two grenades at a us 
government library in suburban makati one of which exploded 
causing minor damage the library had not yet opened and there 
were no injuries police said 
the two sides disagree on whether the united states failed to 
make full aid payments and on when the facilities would actually 
have to close if the two sides cannot reach a lease agreement 
after this round of talks which is to end friday the two sides 
could either begin formal negotiations on a new pact or start 
working on a schedule for closing the bases their lease expires in 
september 1991 
the installations include clark air base the subic bay naval 
base and four smaller facilities 
police said three masked men dressed in black fired two grenades 
about 6 am from a taxi at the thomas jefferson cultural center 
operated by the us information service 
police said the attack could have been timed to the bases talks 
the two sides met into the evening thursday to try to resolve a 
philippine claim that the united states owes 222 million in back 
payments for use of the bases 
us officials said the talks resumed early friday in hopes of a 
compromise before chief us negotiator richard armitage leaves for 
tokyo later in the day 
we are trying to hammer out differences said philippine 
spokesman rafael alunan on thursday i believe that they are 
inching toward some sort of agreement on the payment issue 
in 1988 the reagan administration agreed to provide 962 
million over two years in return for use of the bases through 1991 
congress subsequently cut the bush administrations aid request by 
96 million 
us officials insist they promised only best efforts to 
meet the target and that the aid cut was not a breach of faith 
we have not conceded that there is a shortfall said the 
spokesman for the us delegation stanley schrager we have 
lived up to our commitment and we have made our best effort 
president corazon aquino suggested thursday the united states 
could pay off the debt by providing medical equipment and other 
supplies to the philippines 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states was willing to provide additional equipment to the 
philippines but that it would not be designated as payment of any 
debt 
a classified memorandum prepared in february by the philippines 
department of foreign affairs suggested the government publicly 
demand full us funding for the bases as well as other aid 
programs while quietly agreeing to accept a lower aid figure 
the memo a copy of which was obtained by the associated press 
also said the united states was reluctant to increase aid to the 
philippines because of perceived weak leadership and mismanagement 
by the aquino government 
mrs aquino said thursday it was too early to say whether the 
two sides had reached an impasse 
however philippine senators who must ratify any new bases 
agreement expressed renewed doubts any pact could win approval 
sen john osmena the leading bases advocate in the senate told 
reporters thursday the ball is in the us court if they want 
to stay they have to pay 
senate president jovito salonga said rather than trying to come 
to terms with the united states the philippines should now 
prepare for the next phase and try to effectuate a smooth turnover 
of the military bases 
the philippine government says the lease on the installations 
expires in september 1991 but the united states claims the bases 
could remain one year longer under the current agreement 
president bush has said he would study alternative locations for 
the bases if the negotiations fail

with nearly twothirds of this caribbean countrys polling 
stations reporting results the outcome remained uncertain with 
the two rival candidates in a close race 
balaguer 83 and blind from glaucoma and bosch 80 who has 
moderated his leftist ideology in recent years were opposing each 
other for the fifth time for the presidency of this nation of 7 
million people balaguer won three of those previous elections 
the central electoral board and dr balaguer committed a 
colossal fraud bosch said thursday 
we are announcing that pdl is going into the streets because 
the people have been cheated 
pdl are the spanish initials for boschs leftist dominican 
liberation party 
tomorrow we will be ready to go with the people into the 
streets no matter what the consequences bosch said what 
remains of my life has no meaning if this fraud takes place 
the electoral board later issued a statement saying election law 
prohibited such demonstrations while the vote count was still under 
way 
radio and television stations were barred from carrying 
newscasts during the election period so dominicans were not 
generally aware of his call for demonstrations 
officials of boschs party met thursday with six of the 30 
international observers monitoring the election oscar ayerve of 
ecuador said there was concern over the slow vote count but he did 
not elaborate 
former president jimmy carter one of the observers was in the 
computer room at election headquarters and unavailable for comment 
he said earlier the balloting was fair but gave no assessment of 
the count 
bosch who was overthrown in a 1963 military coup held a narrow 
lead earlier the electoral board announced results of wednesdays 
election by party rather than by candidate 
with 3914 the 6663 polling stations reporting balaguer had 
386766 votes and bosch 375869 official returns showed a former 
socialist mayor of santo domingo jose francisco pena gomez was 
third with 256243 votes 
the two leading parties both claimed victory 
bosch supporters celebrated at party headquarters early thursday 
despite the uncertain outcome sen felix jimenez boschs campaign 
manager said balaguer should recognize his defeat at the polls 
there is not doubt we have won the elections said 
balaguers running mate vice president carlos morales troncoso he 
based his claim on results showing the social christian reformist 
party ahead in 18 of the countrys 29 provinces and in the federal 
district of santo domingo 
balaguers supporters held a vigil at his santo domingo 
residence soldiers patrolled the neighborhood 
most shops in the capital remained closed for a second day no 
disturbances were reported 
returns from the capital of santo domingo with a population of 
2 million were delayed by a computer problem election officials 
said those results could strongly affect the outcome because 
balaguer has done poorly in the capital in previous elections 
about 32 million people were registered to vote nationwide 
the election has been conducted in an adequate and honest 
manner carter said in a statement read on television 
eighteen parties contested wednesdays general election but 
only eight put forward their own presidential candidates among the 
10 that did not four declared in advance that all votes for their 
party would go to balaguer and one committed its votes to bosch 
bosch an author and intellectual who describes himself as a 
marxist but not a communist ran on a moderate platform he pledged 
to work for good relations with the united states and endorsed 
capitalism as the best way to improve his countrys economic plight 
bosch and the army hierarchy have been at odds since he was 
overthrown in a military coup 27 years ago but military officers 
and balaguer stated before the elections they would respect the 
outcome of the vote 
an attempt by an army faction to restore the bosch presidency 
after his ouster led to civil war in 1965 president lyndon johnson 
sent in 23000 us marines to prevent a leftist takeover 
balaguer founder and leader of the social christian reformist 
party rose to power under dictator gen rafael trujillo serving 
briefly as his figurehead president trujillo ruled for 31 years 
until his assassination in 1961 
balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served three 
consecutive fouryear terms before losing in 1978 he was 
reelected in 1986 
the president pinned his hopes in this election largely on a 2 
billion publicworks project to transform centuriesold santo 
domingo he portrayed bosch as a dangerous marxist 
balaguers publicworks project has created thousands of jobs 
but his popularity slumped as the countrys economic problems 
deepened

authorities investigating the matter 
about 1700 flight data transmitters were made at western 
services for the airlaunched cruise missile which can carry 
either conventional or nuclear warheads many were delivered 
untested and below specifications

teenage customers of some record store chains 
now need more than money to buy certain hot lps they need id 
bowing to pressure from politicians and parents over what they 
consider objectionable lyrics some stores have begun to card 
youngsters 
in some places no one under 18 can buy products by rap and 
heavy metal acts that carry a warning label affixed by record 
companies 
this stuff is addictive says state rep jean dixon a fan 
of christian music whose attempt to force record companies to label 
albums with explicit material failed in committee i had a kid 
write and tell me hes addicted to this bad music 
whether record companies and retailers agree with her premise or 
not some are complying among them dallasbased sound warehouse 
inc which has 137 stores in 14 states and streetside records 
which has 19 stores in missouri and kansas 
camelot music the no 2 company in the country carded minors 
for several months before going to a moneyback guarantee last 
month for dissatisfied parents 
weve been carding kids for about two months ever since jean 
dixon started her spiel said jim varvaris manager of a 
streetside store in st louis county some of her comments show 
that shes kind of hogwash 
targets of the measure agree 
its a crock said 17yearold matt lauman of st louis 
standing outside a camelot outlet 
we talk about this stuff in social studies all the time 
said 14yearold megan engbert of st louis its not fair 
the number of albums and tapes that carry warning labels and 
necessitate carding is small varvaris said that of 75 new releases 
his store received monday only two needed stickers 
profanity and references to suicide abortion and sex are on 
dixons hit list 
i think thats an excellent move on the part of the 
retailer said dixon im sure our efforts here had something 
to do with that im very pleased with that and all parents should 
be too thats fantastic 
four years ago the recording industry association of america 
under pressure from the parents music resource center headed by 
tipper gore added warning stickers to certain albums mrs gore is 
the wife of us sen albert gore dtenn 
that effort led to a wide variety of warnings some smaller than 
a postage stamp before the industry settled earlier this year on a 
standardized sticker 
one popular rap album fear of a black planet by public 
enemy is on the restricted list both albums by heavy metal act 
guns n roses carry warning stickers that say they may contain 
objectionable material 
another rap group 2 live crew attempts to evade the censors 
with albums titled as nasty as they wanna be and as clean as 
they wanna be songs such as me so horny and dirty nursery 
rhymes are gone from the grated version 
lawyers for the group have been in court in broward county 
fla where sheriffs deputies had threatened to prosecute store 
owners if they sell as nasty as they wanna be 
a federal judge earlier this week declined to rule immediately 
in a lawsuit brought by the group to restore the album to the 
shelves 
another rapper icet touts his latest album freedom of 
speech just watch what you say as xrated it carries the 
warning some material may be xtra hype and inappropriate for 
squares and suckers 
minors adept at skirting the law to purchase alcohol still are 
getting their hands on albums by hanging around the parking lot and 
persuading an adult to buy it for them 
actually its kind of funny varvaris said theyll come 
back in and say this is my brother hes going to buy the tape 
for me 
record salesmen also wonder whats next is a ratings board 
like that used for movies inevitable will record labeling reach 
into the past and slap restrictions on albums from the 1960s like 
blind faith which has a nude woman on the cover 
even the beatles had explicit lyrics salesman stu olson 
said i mean where do you draw the line

demonstrators standing vigil at the brooklyn 
courthouse erupted in cheers and highfives following the first 
conviction in the bensonhurst racial slaying calling it a message 
to the nation 
we got him one man shouted after learning that joseph fama 
a 19yearold white man had been convicted of seconddegree murder 
and 12 of 14 other counts in the shooting death of 16yearold 
yusuf hawkins a black 
hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of whites as 
they walked through the mostly white bensonhurst section of 
brooklyn on aug 23 
about 150 demonstrators gathered outside the courthouse 
thursday including many whod been there throughout the racially 
charged trial and the 10 days of deliberations nearly all were 
black 
just before the verdict came in a squall hit the neighborhood 
but as word of the decision arrived by bullhorn skies cleared and 
a shaft of sunlight struck the courthouse 
activists whod warned of unrest in the event of an acquittal 
greeted the verdict with glee 
this will send a message shouted ron jackson a lawyer 
it should cool the city this summer 
about 150 police officers were on the street outside the 
courthouse and 150 on other streets nearby with perhaps 150 news 
reporters there have been incidents of minor violence involving 
demonstrators 
before word of the verdict arrived the mood was somber but it 
quickly turned to joy 
you can smile now one demonstrator ronald anthony told a 
police chief who was standing before a line of officers the chief 
smiled 
it made me feel that we can get along said anthony 
alfred mohammed a muslim minister echoed anthony saying the 
verdict lessened tensions 
police lt ray odonnell reported no trouble at the courthouse 
thursday things were calm he said we are very pleased 
as hawkins parents and supporters left the courthouse the 
cheering intensified a small group chanted yusuf yusuf yusuf 
and guilty guilty guilty 
hawkins father moses stewart joined in the chants pumping 
his fist in the air and smiling broadly before the family drove 
away 
a group of about demonstrators marched 100 yards to borough hall 
and mounted the steps carrying with them a makeshift coffin marked 
with the names of victims of racial slayings 
before the verdict famas construction worker father rocco 
said waiting for a decision had been tough and insisted again that 
his son was innocent 
i feel sorry for the guy who died said the elder fama i 
feel bad for the guy i feel bad for my son 
the wait was over for fama but not for the parents of 
19yearold keith mondello the defendant in a parallel trial in 
the bensonhurst case the jury in mondellos trial ended its 
deliberations thursday without reaching a verdict six other white 
youths still face trial in the case 
since the beginning of mondellos trial parents michael and 
susan mondello have avoided speaking with reporters 
they have their moments when they are hopeful by the questions 
sent out by the jurors said mondellos lawyer stephen murphy 
the tendency is to try to read more into it than is really 
there 
the wear and tear is much more than the trial he added 
im exhausted from this

the energy department has agreed to turn over 
health records of a large fraction of its nuclear weapons workers 
to a research group the department said thursday 
the data had been sought in a lawsuit by the three mile island

radioactivity after the 1979 accident at the three mile island 
nuclear power plant near harrisburg pa

agreement friday to make the data available said mj jamison a 
department spokeswoman

installations at 
oak ridge tenn richland wash and los alamos nm covering 
workers at those plants and at plants in mound ohio and rocky 
flats colo 
just how many records are involved was not immediately clear 
ms jamison said she did not have a figure

department and its predecessors since the 1942 organization of the 
manhattan engineer district the code name of the army unit that 
built the first atomic bombs in world war ii

stamable quebec ap the mayor of this farming center 
outside montreal advised residents of houses closest to a burning 
tire dump to evacuate thursday night and about 100 people began 
the exodus 
mayor jacques doyon suggested the residents move to hotels 
because of a forecast change in the wind authorities said thick 
choking smoke from 3 million burning tires may start drifting their 
way 
we cant take chances so we are recommending evacuation 
doyon told a meeting of residents and journalists at the town hall 
in this community of 5000 people 18 miles southeast of montreal 
and 50 miles from the us border 
he told residents the smoke was not toxic but contained 
irritants that could cause coughs nausea eye problems and 
headaches he said elderly people and those who suffer from 
respiratory or cardiac conditions would be at greater risk 
a quebec provincial police spokesman said about 100 people were 
leaving their houses 
heavy rain poured down on the fire earlier thursday and 
authorities said their strategy will be to contain the tire dump 
blaze and then smother it with sand 
the fire began wednesday it quickly spread over most of the 
dump an area the size of seven football fields and sent up a 
column of thick smoke more than 4000 feet high 
dump trucks unloaded sand along the dump perimeter thursday to 
be bulldozed onto the tires once the intensity of the fire dies 
down 
were going to let it burn but at the same time control it 
richard jette a municipal councillor in the community 
it has to burn for some time before we can get close to it and 
eventually smother it 
the tires were stockpiled by stamable resident jeanpaul 
mireault over the last 20 years fire authorities said 
heavy equipment dug trenches around the dump thursday to collect 
the oily runoff from melting tires the mass will be pumped into 
tanker trucks before it can seep into the water table

members of the british army 
have passed intelligence papers to protestant terrorists in 
northern ireland according to a special investigator thursday 
certain members of the ulster defense regiment have been 
involved in collusion with loyalist paramilitaries said john 
stevens an english officer assigned to investigate claims by 
loyalist gunmen they received police files 
it would however be wrong to conclude that there is a 
significant proportion of ulster defense regiment soldiers who are 
involved with paramilitaries this is not the case he said 
stevens said 94 people were arrested as a result of his 
investigation and 59 were charged or reported for criminal 
offenses he did not indicate how many of those were ulster defense 
regiment members 
the regiment is a locally recruited british army unit whose 
members are almost exclusively protestant 
no members of the provincial police force the royal ulster 
constabulary were charged as a result of his inquiry but two 
officers were under investigation he said 
the findings was met by different reactions 
it was denounced as a whitewash by sinn fein the political 
wing of the irish republican army 
peter robinson deputy leader of the protestant hardline 
democratic unionist party dismissed the report as a cynical 
political exercise brought out to appease nationalists 
peter brooke the top british official in the province told the 
house of commons he was convinced the regiment was fundamentally 
sound but said the report has highlighted shortcomings and 
deficiencies in several important areas 
stevens was appointed in september by royal ulster constabulary 
chief constable hugh annesley 
the inquiry followed the murder of a roman catholic loughlin 
maginn by the ulster freedom fighters an illegal protestant 
paramilitary group 
when maginns relatives claimed he was not associated with any 
terrorist group the ulster freedom fighters released police 
documents that described him as a terrorist suspect 
the freedom fighters decision to publicize its possession of 
intelligence documents drew attention to fears within the roman 
catholic community that the security forces are not impartial the 
ulster defense regiment which is 97 percent protestant has been a 
particular target of catholic complaints of harassment and 
brutality and 16 regiment men have been convicted of murder 
the ulster defense regiment is widely disliked by northern 
irelands catholic minority and the irish government has called 
for the unit to be disbanded the british government and local 
protestant politicians have firmly defended the regiment 
stevens said the security forces had produced large quantities 
of documents necessary for antiterrorist operations 
there has however been a serious lack of control and 
adequate accounting procedures relating to the distribution of 
these documents stevens said 
in some cases stevens said people were recruited by the ulster 
defense regiment against the recommendations of the royal ulster 
constabulary 
a small number of these went on to commit terroristrelated 
and criminal offenses whilst serving with the regiment he said 
many potential recruits came from strongly loyalist 
neighborhoods and were subject to intense pressures stevens said 
as members of the british army ulster defense regiment members 
are targeted by the irish republican army and other paramilitary 
units opposed to british rule since 1970 when the unit was formed 
186 members have been killed 
stevens recommended forming a special antiterrorist squad 
within the royal ulster constabulary but annesley disagreed such 
a squad might work in britain where there were 23 terrorist 
incidents last year annesley said but not in northern ireland 
were there were 1655 incidents 
nearly 2800 people have been killed in northern ireland since 
sectarian violence began in august 1969 the violence has declined 
in recent years

an alabama senator called thursday for a 
pentagon investigation into the resignation of a female us naval 
academy midshipman who was handcuffed to a mens room urinal and 
taunted by male classmates 
sen richard shelby dala a member of the senate armed 
services committee wrote defense secretary dick cheney and navy 
secretary lawrence garrett iii asking them to personally 
investigate the circumstances surrounding gwen marie dreyers 
resignation 
those responsible for the sexual harassment were only given 
demerits and a loss of leave time while the victim has felt it 
necessary to resign from the navy shelby wrote 
i have also been led to believe that the victim was 
intimidated by classmates who warned her not to testify at a 
disciplinary hearing he said 
the academy superintendent rear adm virgil l hill jr said 
wednedsay he had asked the chairman of the academys board of 
visitors to form a special subcommittee to report back this summer 
with an honest appraisal and a good set of recommendations 
hill said the panel would include sen barbara mikulski dmd 
and three other members and would work with a study group updating 
a 1987 study on how well women have been assimilated into the 
academy 
hill called the incident that led to dreyers resignation a 
very very isolated one 
sexual harassment is something we try to deal with and try to 
fix he said 
shelby said he found the incident reprehensible and he urged 
the pentagon officials to make all efforts to determine whether 
there is an institutional bias against women in our military 
academies 
i hope that this is just an isolated incident that it is not 
reflective of a deep seated bias agaisnt women in our military 
he said 
dreyer of encinitas calif resigned from the naval academy 
last month after she became dissatisfied with the investigation of 
the dec 8 incident at the once allmale academy in annapolis md 
midshipmen 2nd class john hindinger and tom rosson were punished 
with demerits and loss of leave time as a result of the incident 
six other midshipmen received written warnings for lesser roles in 
the incident 
the academy ruled that the incident wasnt premediated and 
therefore could not be considered hazing which can lead to 
dismissal 
hill described the incident as a goodnatured exchange that 
got out of hand he said it escalated from a snowball fight 
that had taken place minutes before 
dreyer was pulled from her dormitory room and dragged to the 
bathroom by male midshipmen she was eventually freed from the 
urinal after her roommates shoved their way into the crowd and 
pleaded for the keys to the handcuffs 
about 10 percent of the 3000 midshipmen at the academy are 
women 
a 1987 study of the assimilation of women into the academy since 
they first were admitted in 1976 found that 35 percent of the women 
who enrolled in the academy eventually left compared with 22 
percent of the men

amnesty international on wednesday demanded china 
account for the whereabouts of more than 650 prisoners arrested 
since the june crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
the londonbased human rights group said many prisoners were 
reportedly beaten and tortured 
one year after the killings in beijing the fate of those 
prisoners is still veiled in official secrecy but they are not 
forgotten amnesty said in a written statement we know some of 
their names and we want to know what has happened to them 
amnesty has estimated at least 1000 were killed and thousands 
injured when troops moved in on peaceful demonstrators in tiananmen 
square on june 34 
the chinese government has said nearly 300 people died during 
the action including armed forces members 
amnesty said it had sent a list of more than 650 names of 
chinese prisoners to chinese prime minister li peng with a request 
for information on what has happened to them 
china has said 6000 people were arrested following weeks of 
prodemocracy demonstrations which were crushed by the military in 
june amnesty international disputed that figure saying a more 
accurate number is in the tens of thousands 
amnesty said the killings and arrests last year are just the 
most recent dramatic examples of sweeping and persistent 
persecution in china our message to the government is that these 
human rights violations are an international concern and that 
international pressure will not go away 
workers arrested since the june crackdown in beijing are

a bill that would have passed if a 
legislators son hadnt cast a no vote while sitting at his 
fathers desk was defeated wednesday when the house reconsidered it 
state rep mike langton a democrat from jacksonville said his 
12yearold son brian learned a valuable lesson 
when you do something that you know you shouldnt there are 
consequences to that act langston said im not embarrassed i 
think brian was embarrassed 
the boy was working as a page may 4 when the bill sponsored by 
rep ron glickman dtampa came up for a final vote it would have 
created a comprehensive list of children waiting for help from the 
state department of health and rehabilitative services 
langton was out of the chamber making a telephone call during 
the roll call sitting at his fathers desk and faced with a choice 
of punching the green yes button or the red no button 
brian chose red 
the result was a 5353 tie which defeated the bill 
once he did it he suddenly had all these legislators hulking 
over him saying did your dad tell you to do that langton said 
when langton returned to find out that his son had defeated the 
bill he told glickman he would have voted yes and rep fred 
lippman dhollywood asked that the vote be reconsidered 
on the house floor wednesday langton joked that his son would 
vote differently if given a second chance 
over the weekend i had the opportunity to confer with my son 
brian and were it not for the pressures of his final exams in the 
sixth grade he would be here today and he wanted you to know that 
he would vote in favor of mr glickmans bill langton said 
despite glickmans efforts to amend the bill and appease 
lawmakers worried about its cost and effectiveness it was defated 
again this time by a 6052 count glickman said he held no grudge 
against brian 
i dont consider that event as something that fundamentally 
changed the course of history he said

appealing for continued sanctions nelson 
mandela on wednesday told foreign ministers of the british 
commonwealth that south africas white government is still allowing 
police to murder blacks 
we call upon you to impress upon your governments and 
those other governments you could influence to halt and reverse the 
efforts to untimely and wrongly lift sanctions said mandela 
deputy president of the african national congress the anc is the 
leading group fighting the apartheid system of racial separation in 
south africa 
mandela was addressing a ministerial committee on south africa 
of the 37nation forum of britain and its former colonies before 
leaving wednesday night for algeria 
calls for the lifting of sanctions against the government of 
south africa are dangerous steps while blacks in the country 
continue to be killed daily by police with the clear sanction of 
the government mandela charged 
apartheid the central problem that all of us are trying to 
put an end to remains untouched in place and intact he said 
south african president fw de klerk freed mandela from prison 
and announced a host of reforms in february mandela was in prison 
for 27 years after he was convicted of plotting to sabotage the 
government 
de klerk is holding talks with mandela and other black leaders 
to clear obstacles for fullscale negotiations on bringing blacks 
into the political system 
mandelas appeal wednesday was supported by nigerian leader gen 
ibrahim babangida who told the meeting the world should not be 
overly impressed with the tentative steps of de klerk de klerk 
is now on a european tour

wednesday as saying civilians found guilty of helping to plot an 
april 22 coup attempt will face firing squads along with rebel

a jury deciding the case of a white man accused 
of killing a black teenager met in a closed courtroom wednesday 
with the trial judge as their deliberations crawled through a tenth 
day 
meanwhile a separate jury considering charges against a second 
defendant also charged with murder in the attack was sequestered 
for the night after one juror reported feeling ill 
both juries were to resume deliberations thursday morning 
the first panel weighing charges against joseph fama wanted a 
private explanation of what constituted murder by depraved 
indifference and state supreme court justice thaddeus owens 
granted their request 
owens said the jurors asked for the closeddoor session so they 
could speak openly and ask questions 
when reporters objected owens replied im not going to allow 
you in here because they dont want it 
he then ordered the courtroom emptied 
the jurors feel inhibited they feel intimidated by the 
media owens said fama his lawyer david depetris and 
prosecutors were in the courtroom while the judge spoke with the 
jurors privately 
owens later opened the courtroom and defined murder by depraved 
indifference for the jury in the presence of reporters if you 
find that he had mental culpability and he solicits requests or 
aids others in the commission of this crime he is guilty he 
said 
outside the courtroom depetris said he felt owens instruction 
was unfair the judge gives the impression that very little is 
needed to convict on depraved indifference he said 
fama 19 is charged with fatally shooting yusuf hawkins in the 
predominantly white bensonhurst neighborhood last aug 23 
codefendant mondello was the alleged ringleader of the white gang 
which attacked the black youth 
the mondello jury which has twice sent out notes saying 
deliberations were at a standstill ended its ninth day of 
discussions 
mondellos lawyer stephen murphy said outside the courtroom 
i dont think the judge is going to force a verdict out of them 
mondello 19 was charged in a 16count indictment in connection 
with the hawkins slaying the major charges against mondello are 
murder and manslaughter

a man has sued an insurance company claiming 
it canceled his coverage after confusing his medical history with 
that of his cocker spaniel 
michael j niderberg of murrysville is seeking in excess of 
20000 and a jury trial in allegheny county court in a sixcount 
lawsuit filed last week 
according to the lawsuit new york life insurance co revoked 
coverage because prescription drugs for the pet were listed in 
niderbergs name the dog pepper suffers from occasional 
seizures said niderbergs attorney bruce gelman 
niderbergs problems began after he had emergency surgery in 
august 1988 for a bleeding ulcer he was hospitalized again in 
october 1988 for followup surgery 
new york life paid about 1000 in medical bills before 
canceling coverage and refusing to pay the balance which came to 
more than 50000 
the lawsuit claims new york lifes decision was based in part on 
a mistaken belief niderberg had a seizure disorder he had not 
disclosed previously on the companys medical questionnaire 
gelman said his client told him the practice in massachusetts 
where he lived when the medications were prescribed was to issue 
the drug in the name of the pets owner 
attorney daniel lawson who is representing new york life 
declined to comment on the case because it was in litigation david 
pomerantz a spokesman for new york life in new york said company 
policy barred him from commenting on the case

two daughters of a former childabuse expert won a 
multimilliondollar award against their father on wednesday for 
what they said was years of physical and sexual abuse 
sharon simone 45 of boston and her sister susan hammond 44 
of southern california sued their 72yearold father edward j 
rodgers a former fbi agent and chief investigator for the el paso 
county district attorneys office which employed him as a 
childabuse expert 
the sisters sought unspecified damages from their father for 
repeated physical and sexual abuse allegedly inflicted by rodgers 
between 1944 and 1965 
neither rodgers nor his attorney was present during the trial 
and the proceedings were conducted by the sisters female lawyers 
before an allfemale jury handpicked by the attorneys 
rodgers recently fired his attorney thomas d gresham who said 
this week that he has been unable to locate his client 
the jury began deliberations on wednesday and returned after 
only a few hours with an award of 12 million for each sister it 
awarded 600000 to each sister for economic and noneconomic 
damages and 600000 for punitive damages colorado law does not 
allow punitive damages to exceed other damages 
hammond and simone expressed remorse and regret at a news 
conference after the trial that rodgers had not come forward to 
take responsibility for his actions and to hear the graphic 
testimony in the case 
the trial was about truth and justice and for me 
compensation said hammond i was angry at the thought of my 
father dying and meeting his god and getting justice that way i 
wanted some justice in this world and if it comes in the form of 
money thats how ill take it 
the sisters said they didnt know if they would ever collect the 
award 
simone and hammond as well as their sisters elizabeth 
beanie medlicott and mary larocque testified during two days 
of testimony about the physical emotional and sexual trauma 
inflicted by rodgers as they were growing up in denver and colorado 
springs 
medlicott and larocque were not plaintiffs in the trial but 
testified on behalf of their sisters 
edward rodgers defended himself against the allegations in a 
deposition he admitted that he hit his wife and may have hit his 
children but didnt remember doing so he described himself as a 
perfectionist who had fought alcoholism for years 
i have thought of myself for years as a domineering son of a 
bitch who demanded strict obedience from my children he said 
i know that i have a terrible temper im sure that i was harsh 
with them but i dont know that it rose to the level of criminal 
abuse 
the sisters have all undergone extensive counseling and 
psychiatric treatment and simone and hammond say they are unable 
to have intimate sexual relationships

a man seeking justice for the 1984 murder of his 
wife is suing cuban president fidel castro because the killer was a 
mariel refugee 
leonardo rodriguez now 38 was convicted of killing jean ludwig 
as she jogged along a key largo bike path 
at the time fidel castro and cuba forced rodriguez into the 
united states both of them knew rodriguez was a rapist and a 
murderer whom they had confined to prison in cuba for those 
offenses gerald ludwigs lawsuit says 
in 1980 rodriguez was among 125000 mariel refugees who crossed 
the florida straits named for the port from which they left in a 
castroauthorized exodus 
castro didnt know who the victim would be but he knew the 
consequences of releasing violent criminals into the streets of 
florida james lynch ludwigs attorney said tuesday 
its an outrageous act by a foreign government that had a 
direct impact on us lynch said adding that ludwig a fisheries 
biologist who now lives in louisiana doesnt want it happening 
to anyone else 
lynch first filed the wrongful death suit in 1988 but a dade 
circuit judge dismissed the case because castro had not been served 
with court papers within the 90day limit set by the supreme court 
lynch refiled the suit in october late last month another 
circuit judge gave him 60 days to serve papers on castro and his 
government 
there is no indication yet that the papers have been received in

west german official said they were struggling with logistical 
problems but an east german minister claimed the soviets had 
political motivations 
west german defense ministry spokesman capt stefan lang told 
the associated press the soviets were having troubling reabsorbing 
troops pulled out of eastern europe we dont see political 
motivations he said

economic troubles in the soviet union will create problems for 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs plans to bring tens of 
thousands of soldiers home

overall soviet reductions would lead to a superiority of the 
west in military strength

from east germany according to lang the number was to be about 
36000 troops nearly onetenth the soviet force estimated to be

will drop any reservations about the bills cost when they hold

many brazilians see the trial of 
three ranchers accused of killing chico mendes a champion of 
rubber tappers and the rain forest as a test of justice in a 
nation traditionally ruled by money 
it is to begin next month on a date not yet determined in a 
tiny courtroom in the amazon jungle town of xapuri where mendes 
was shot down outside his home dec 11 1988 
at issue in addition to the facts of the case are a disregard 
for law that has penetrated all levels of brazilian society and 
the general belief that the rich and powerful can bribe their way 
out of anything 
morality in brazil has hit such a low that ethical conduct is 
no longer regarded as practical rio sociologist helio jaguaribe 
said in an interview 
money always has been valued above the law in this nation of 150 
million which is suffering its worst economic crisis but the 
mendes case has highlighted what brazilians call the impunity 
of the rich it also has inspired demands for moral and judicial 
reform 
mendes who was 44 when he died led a rubber tappers union and 
fought to save the amazon from deforestation he was killed despite 
warnings to brazils top justice officials that named his potential 
assassins 
internationally he became a martyr to environmentalism in 
brazil he is revered more as a man who died protecting the rights 
of peasants against powerful ranchers who often hire gunmen to do 
their bidding in the jungle 
the national and international outcry produced an initial flurry 
of activity police arrested a cattle rancher and his two sons a 
month after the killing and promised repeatedly that justice would 
be done 
judicial squabbling and red tape have put the trial on hold for 
17 months however and the three suspects nearly escaped from the 
lightly guarded acre state penitentiary in january 
because of the delay some have begun to wonder whether the 
trial will occur amnesty international says only two of 1000 
killings linked to land conflicts between brazilian peasants and 
landowners have gone to trial since 1980 
several assassination attempts were made last year on julio 
barbosa who succeeded mendes as leader of the xapuri rubber 
tappers 
corruption took root under the military regimes of 19641985 and 
blossomed after five years of ineffectual government under civilian 
president jose sarney who was replaced in march by fernando collor 
de mello 
during sarneys term nearly all the federal budget was spent on 
financing a bloated government 
fraud in financing a multimilliondollar railroad project and a 
graft scandal involving a former planning minister went unpunished 
newspapers regularly carried reports of legislators paying for 
extravagant trips with public money 
people have read so much about the dirty deals of corrupt 
congressmen and state officials that they think anything goes 
said radley vigio a rio police officer 
on new years eve 1988 the tourist boat bateau mouche iv built 
to carry 50 was jammed with 150 revelers and sank in front of 
sugar loaf mountain killing 54 people naval police had stopped 
the boat but let it go and there were accusations a bribe was 
paid 
last october a clandestine landfill created by a private 
construction company collapsed on the nova republica slum in sao 
paulo at least 14 people were known dead and about 75 were never 
found 
no one has been arrested in either case 
these inhuman things happen because the guilty often slip 
through the fingers of the justice system said lt eide 
trindade director of rios task force on organized crime 
an outdated legal code labyrinthine bureacracy and lack of 
resources discourage police which prompts people to take the law 
into their own hands 
a mob of 1000 people raided a jail in the northeastern town of 
santa maria da vitoria last year and lynched two men suspected of 
killing a 19yearold woman 
violence continues in the amazon leftist union leader expeditor 
ribeiro de souza and two of his three sons were killed recently in 
the northern amazon state of para despite warnings to the police 
that ranchers had hired gunmen to kill them

moldavians are moving closer together 
despite the frontier josef stalin erected between them in 1940 when 
he seized bessarabia from romania and made it soviet moldavia 
early in april romanian peasants in the border area dismantled 
the wire fence on their side of the prut river border and urged 
soviet moldavians do to the same 
on sunday may 6 soviet moldavia opened the border for six 
hours so romanians could cross and visit their ethnic brethren 
tens of thousands did so 
soviet citizens were not allowed to visit romania but some 
sneaked in 
people on both sides call the area a cradle of romanian culture 
for centuries iasi was a center of romanian learning and 
capital of a greater moldavia that included bessarabia and 
northern bukovina also annexed by moscow in 1940 and now in the 
ukraine the city of 500000 romanias secondlargest is only 6 
miles from the border 
despite the calls for reunion some inhabitants do not appear 
eager to make iasi the center of a newly reunified greater 
moldavia 
its not exactly the right time said alexandru pascu a 
senior reporter with the cultural weekly cronica we should see 
first what happens with lithuania latvia and estonia then ask 
that bessarabia be returned to romania 
if we do it now gorbachev wont accept the breakup of his 
empire and will probably use force to prevent it 
president mikhail s gorbachev imposed economic sanctions on 
lithuania after it proclaimed independence from the soviet union 
latvia and estonia also have declared their intention to become 
independent but have proceeded more cautiously 
stalin annexed all three baltic republics as he did bessarabia 
and northern bukovina under a secret protocol of his 1939 
nonagression pact with hitler 
romulus neagu deputy foreign minister of romania told 
reporters in bucharest romania has no territorial claims but as 
a general principle one should observe the right of every nation 
to selfdetermination 
with political union a distant goal moldavias new culture 
minister ion ungureanu has urged creation of a cultural 
confederation 
in an interview with the romanian newpaper adevarul in march he 
said that would allow moldavians and soviet moldavians to receive 
each others television programs 
about 300 prominent authors journalists and orthodox priests 
from bucharest and kishinev capital of soviet moldavia met in 
bucharest on march 27 and demanded that soviet moldavia or 
bessarabia be allowed to rejoin romania 
the meeting was organized for the 72nd anniversary of the union 
of the province with romania in 1918 after world war i 
gheorghe ghimpu head of the moldavian peoples front of soviet 
moldavia declared at the conference the tragedy of moldavians 
started with the hitlerstalin pact when unjust frontiers were 
imposed 
nicolae stoicescu religious affairs minister of romania 
appealed for the strengthening of cultural and spiritual unity 
between romania and soviet moldavia as a first step toward 
political union 
other speakers demanded the amputated territory be returned 
to romania 
yevgeny tyazhelnikov then soviet ambassador to romania 
acknowledged late in march that there are tendencies aiming at 
the greater independence of moldavia but ruled out returning 
bessarabia to romania 
stoicescu met with moldavians who advocate increased cultural 
cooperation including deliveries of religious books in romanian to 
the soviet side of the border 
soviet moldavians requested romanian assistance and experts for 
restoration of churches in the republic 
millions of romanians and moldavians now can receive sunday 
broadcasts of orthodox mass by radio iasi which resumed operation 
after communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was deposed and executed 
in december 
ceausescu closed the station in 1985 it now broadcasts 
religious historical and other news to ethnic moldavians who make 
up 70 percent of soviet moldavias population 
revival of the radio station and growing border contacts are 
among the strongest indications to date of romanias desire for 
some control over soviet moldavia 
soviet moldavians began pressing for greater autonomy two years 
ago 
in september soviet officials agreed to replace the cyrillic 
alphabet imposed by stalin with the latin alphabet romanians use

schools are crumbling the administration is 
rife with bunglers kids are failing tests and dropping out at a 
colossal rate and board of education bureaucrats are writing 
memos telling teachers how to wash their hands 
apply soap lather well advised step no 3 
this is what joseph a fernandez found when he arrived five 
months ago at 110 livingston st headquarters of the nations 
largest school system but since he took office as schools 
chancellor fernandez has shaken the system of its lethargy he 
envisions a lean mean education machine 
im sure some people view me as the outsider coming in and 
stirring this whole system up fernandez said 
the bottom line on this is how does it impact kids he said 
im not concerned with how it impacts everybody else 
fernandez moved quickly to strengthen his authority he 
dismissed several local school officials and took over the board 
governing one of the systems 32 local districts 
the staff of 5200 at 110 livingston was cut by 400 by 
fernandez edict top aides must be in the office by 730 am and 
while there they and the rest of the staff must follow rules on 
such things as office neatness how to dress and proper telephone 
etiquette 
he wants things done and he wants them done properly said 
his spokesman james vlasto probably for the veterans here its 
taken them somewhat aback 
the number of teachers and students in the system almost 11 
million combined is larger than the population of dallas the 
nations seventhlargest city and its 7 billion budget is bigger 
than that of 15 states 
the problems are just as big more than 35 percent of the 
950000 students read below minimum standards there is a backlog 
of 33000 repair requests for the systems 1000 buildings in the 
198889 school year 1854 weapons were confiscated from students 
and 9000 reports of violence were recorded 
fernandez a 53yearold native new yorker who spent his entire 
career outside the city seems unfazed sitting behind a massive 
oak desk classical music playing softly in the background he 
gives the impression of a man firmly in control 
practicing what he preaches everything on the desk and 
theres not much is piled neatly a computer terminal sits to one 
side he is the first schools chancellor to ask for one 
he admits he has stepped on a few toes with his direct style 
and angered some local school board members who feel he is 
overstepping his authority under the 20yearold state law that 
decentralized the city schools 
some examples 
he appointed trustees to take over a longtroubled brooklyn 
school district where auditors found 2 million was misspent and 
children were deprived of remedial reading drug education and 
other services 
he ordered the suspension or removal of two district school 
superintendents and three principals 
he overturned a local school boards selection of a 
superintendent issuing new rules in the process setting minimum 
standards for the job another school board was ordered to fire an 
untenured principal 
he is seeking to have each of the citys 1000 schools publish 
an annual budget for public scrutiny 
fernandez entire educational career had been in florida where 
he started as a math teacher in 1962 within 10 years he became 
miamis first hispanic principal and was named superintendent of 
schools there in 1987 
he already has managed feats in new york that his predecessors 
were unable to accomplish 
gov mario cuomo signed an act giving him the power to transfer 
principals who had been granted building tenure by law the 
bill passed after fernandez hammered out a deal with the 
principals union 
he also has support in albany the state capital to eliminate 
the city board of examiners a teacher licensing board that critics 
say duplicates the state licensing apparatus and discourages 
teachers from working in new york city 
but fernandez biggest innovation is one that he pioneered as 
head of schools in miami one that if successful could free 
schools from such board of education dictates as last years 
sevenstep handwashing memo 
the plan called schoolbased management and shared 
decisionmaking would allow teachers parents and principals to 
identify problems in their own schools problems like reading 
levels poor attendance or drugs and develop solutions 
fernandez said he expects about 200 schools to participate in 
the first year officials at each school will receive 20000 to 
use as they see fit for training or to hire consultants for 
example 
its their plan their strategy their dollars he said 
as you get ownership my experience has been people try a little 
bit harder to make the thing work 
the chancellors office will provide technical assistance and 
check progress toward the goals having the ability to step in 
when the things not working right and fixing it fernandez said 
theres a lot of people not just here in the city watching 
but nationally he said if it plays in new york it can play 
anywhere 
fernandez has more innovations in mind he is talking about 
increasing the highschool math requirement their plans 
the association will never stop trying to broadcast nick 
said never never never 
the ship is named after the statue erected by demonstrators in 
tiananmen square in beijing in may 1989 it was destroyed during 
the june 4 military crackdown that left hundreds perhaps 
thousands of civilians dead 
exiled chinese dissident leaders have expressed support for the 
project but none were expected to be on board for the broadcasts 
because of threats from beijing that it would arrest chinese aboard 
the nationalists retreated to taiwan in 1949 after losing a 
civil war to communist forces in mainland china while the two 
sides remain technically at war indirect trade and civilian 
contacts have increased in recent years

early in the show a couple drunkenly staggers 
into their motel room at night at dawn she gets mad when he 
suggests in crude terms itd be no good for either of them if 
others knew of their affair 
ah what i mean is we function professionally first he 
says trying to mollify her he worsens matters by saying they need 
to keep an official distance 
this tends to undermine by dawns early light an hbo movie 
premiering saturday that concerns the prospect of doom thanks to 
soviet military dissidents trying to provoke nuclear war with the 
united states 
you see the man in the motel powers boothe is an air force 
major a b52 bomber pilot the woman rebecca de mornay is his 
copilot 
it just does not do for b52 bomber pilots to have love affairs 
sure as heck theyll have a tiff at an awkward moment like while 
en route to a soviet target 
suppose she sees one of the planes bombs go off suppose she 
realizes the end of humanity is likely and refuses orders to drop 
another big one 
well she might be considered sane but her beau might pull 
rank give her a bottle of cyanide pills and say you are 
relieved captain get the hell out of here and then relent and 
gently plead dont leave me now 
alas these things happen and they sandbag what might otherwise 
be an interesting film about how the end of the cold war doesnt 
necessarily mean the possibility of nuclear war is gone too 
written by bruce gilbert the films trip to the edge of 
armageddon begins when soviet dissidents launch a nuclear missile 
against one of their own cities 
this triggers an automatic nuclear attack on us military bases 
and andrews air force base near washington then the start of the 
us counterattack of which boothes fivemember b52 crew is part 
the soviet president learning the truth of the first strike on 
his nation desperately tries to turn off the war pleading with 
his american counterpart martin landau to do likewise 
the american wants to believe him and orders only an attack 
similar in scope to that of the soviets despite recommendations of 
massive retaliation 
but the war escalates because of an error us computers dont 
initially realize a second soviet launch is directed at china not 
the united states 
the crisis worsens when the us president is thought killed in 
a nuclear blast his immediate successors all are dead and 
leadership of the nation passes to the secretary of the interior 
darren mcgavin 
in a welcome switch for this kind of movie not all top us 
military officers are portrayed as bombcrazed killthecommies 
lunatics 
in fact two senior officers james earl jones as the general 
commanding an airborne command post and jeffrey de munn as the new 
presidents military adviser are the ones who repeatedly urge 
restraint 
but its to no avail since the new inexperienced president 
succumbs to the letsgoboom blandishments of an army colonel rip 
torn 
if thats not bad enough one of boothes crew members in 
anguish over the deaths of his family in the soviet attack goes 
mad that has a terrible impact on most of the crew in his b52 
but the movies inflight attempt to heighten the drama just 
doesnt work the film would have been far better without a b52 
crew lurking in it 
for starters this crews cockpit discipline is plumb awful and 
its very hard to believe that not only is a woman flying the 
bomber women in the us military still are barred from combat 
slots but that she and the command pilot are bunkmates 
boothe as a flier of the goodoldboy school turns in a 
masterful performance despite dialogue so clunky it constitutes a 
lethal weapon and the larger issues of doom raised by the movie do 
get one to thinking 
but by shoehorning in amour and turning its b52 into the love 
bomber by dawns early light proves a lot more dim than it 
should have been

new hampshires firstinthenation 
presidential primary was beginning to rev up at this time four 
years ago this time around its stuck in the garage 
presidential hopefuls including democrats richard gephardt and 
bruce babbitt were campaigning actively in the state in may 1986 
republican george bush and other candidates had campaign people at 
work there 
this year no potential candidates have visited in the past six 
months and no campaign people are soliciting support for wouldbe 
presidents 
democratic political activists in the state arent lamenting the 
lack of attention 
a long campaign focuses attention much too early and it takes 
away from things we need to be doing at the state and local 
levels said state house minority leader mary chambers who ran 
michael dukakis 1988 campaign in new hampshire 
i dont believe the firstinthenation primary is beneficial 
for the state said dennis murphy who ran illinois sen paul 
simons 1988 presidential campaign in the state it takes away 
from state politics 
in the 1988 race gephardt campaigned for more than two years in 
iowa and new hampshire the missouri congressman won the iowa 
caucus and finished second to dukakis in new hampshire but ended 
up withdrawing before the national convention 
jean wallin cochair of gephardts 1988 new hampshire campaign 
said there isnt any reason for them to be here now you can 
accomplish as much in one year as in two and you wont be burned 
out at election time 
murphy agreed 
the joke in new hampshire in 1980 was people would be asked 
are you going to vote for ronald reagan and they would answer 
i dont know ive only met him twice he said i dont think 
its necessary for each person to meet a candidate four times 
before making a decision 
with reagans retirement on the horizon candidates and workers 
from both parties began descending on new hampshire two years 
before the 1988 primary this time president bush is expected to 
seek another term and republican candidates are nonexistent 
several prominent democrats have visited the state including 
gephardt west virginia sen jay rockefeller ohio gov richard 
celeste and colorado rep patricia schroeder but none recently 
ned helms new hampshire democratic party chairman said many 
top democrats have turned down invitations to speak in new 
hampshire because they fear a visit would be misconstrued those 
who have stayed away include texas sen lloyd bentsen new jersey 
sen bill bradley and new york gov mario cuomo he said 
people are reluctant to come to new hampshire because the 
minute they get here people say aha youre running helms 
said 
other possible factors keeping democrats from jumping into the 
campaign are bushs high approval rating and the thrashing dukakis 
took in 1988 activists said 
i guess the democrats may be thinking that bush is a 
shooin wallin said i certainly hope thats not the case 
state gop chairwoman rhona charbonneau and others said 
massachusetts swift economic decline which began while dukakis 
was campaigning for the presidency has made candidates wary of 
starting too early 
many potential democratic candidates also are concerned with 
reelection and dont want to risk leaving their states to start a 
presidential campaign activists said 
so when might candidates begin arriving in new hampshire most 
political observers predict the stream of potential presidents will 
begin sometime after the november elections and most likely early 
next year 
people should check their christmas cards so theyll know 
whos going to be here in january wallin said 
end adv pm mon may 21

iowas perpetual campaign machinery is 
running short on one key component presidential candidates 
its a national question who are the candidates said 
democratic activist john cacciatore 
the 1990 midterm elections still are months away but thoughts 
already are turning toward the 1992 race for the white house in 
iowa whose precinct caucuses are the nations first test of 
presidential strength things have been quiet but few are surprised 
not that there havent been any visitors the day after the 1988 
election jesse jackson courted farm activists in des moines and 
he returned the following year 
texas sen lloyd bentsen keynoted a democratic party fundraiser 
last fall and lectured activists on the lessons to be learned from 
the partys latest loss 
new jersey sen bill bradley raised some money for local 
candidates and hawaii sen daniel inouye even joked about 
accepting the partys nomination during an event this year 
colorado rep pat schroeder has given a couple of policy speeches 
all in all activists say things are about on track 
at this point in the last cycle you would have not seen 
anybody a lot said barry piatt who worked for missouri rep 
richard gephardts 1988 presidential campaign gephardt won the 
iowa caucus but withdrew before the national convention 
this year the story is a democratic one since president bush is 
expected to seek a second term theres been intense speculation 
about who the democrats will field and some have worried that none 
are making early moves 
iowa democratic party spokesman joe shannahan rejected those 
concerns and pointed to campaign records from previous election 
cycles 
the first candidate to put staffers in the field the last time 
around was former arizona gov bruce babbitt who dispatched two 
aides to work for local candidates in the summer of 1986 he said 
in the 1984 election cycle records show only token campaign 
appearances by this point florida gov reubin askew made one 
appearance in the spring of 1982 as did california sen alan 
cranston colorado sen gary hart made a single foray in may 1982 
while ohio sen john glenn didnt visit iowa until june of that 
year 
only the eventual 1984 democratic nominee walter f mondale 
had made multiple appearances by this point the records show 
further shannahan said the last election cycle was an 
intensely active one because there was no incumbent on the ballot 
us rep david nagle a former state democratic chairman said 
the timing of this years campaign is logical 
bentsen he said generated wide name identification when he ran 
on the 1988 ticket with massachusetts gov michael dukakis and 
would benefit by the shortest possible campaign 
others have whats known as the 1990 problem 
the reason you dont have presidential candidates in iowa this 
year is because the potential presidential candidates are running 
for reelection in their home states nagle said 
bradley gephardt tennessee sen albert gore jr new york gov 
mario cuomo illinois sen paul simon and ms schroeder all are on 
the ballot this year he noted 
while many see the early presidential contests as an endurance 
contest thats not always the case 
dukakis won his partys nomination and finished a respectable 
third in iowa his first campaign appearance in the state came in 
january 1987 roughly a year before the precinct caucuses 
you can come reasonably late to iowa and still get a fair 
shake nagle said

former gov lester maddox whose name 
became synonymous with southern segregationist defiance in the 
1960s is back campaigning for his old job and outrageously 
outspoken as ever 
but he says good government not race is his issue now 
let there be no mistake maddox who closed his pickrick fried 
chicken restaurant in atlanta in the 60s rather than serve blacks 
still disapproves of desegregation 
as well as a constitutional human right to associate with 
whomever you please there should be a corresponding right to 
disassociate if you please he said recently 
but he prefers to colorfully expound on his contention that hes 
the only hope of freeing georgia from the grip of wasteful 
political insiders 
i want to be your ex lax in state government was a frequent 
quip one warm spring day as he pounded the sidewalks and shopping 
centers in the southern suburbs of atlanta popping in on 
unsuspecting merchants and their customers and momentarily taking 
center stage 
spry at age 74 despite a bout with cancer maddox is one of five 
candidates seeking the democratic gubernatorial nomination in the 
states july 17 primary 
a 16year absence from state office has taken its toll a recent 
newspaper poll showed maddox in last place in the fiveman 
democratic field with 3 percent former atlanta mayor andrew young 
led with 29 percent in his bid to become the nations second black 
elected governor and georgias first 
maddox sees it differently either me or andy young is going 
to be the next governor 
a public school dropout who later took a correspondence course 
and opened a restaurant maddox became georgias governor in 1967 
because of a fluke in state law 
nationally known for opposing integration including an incident 
in which customers at his restaurant armed themselves with pick 
handles maddox won the democratic nomination in 1966 but got fewer 
votes in the general election than republican howard bo 
callaway 
writein votes for other candidates kept callaway from receiving 
a majority the election thus was thrown to the heavily democratic 
legislature which chose maddox 
despite his advance billing maddox said in his inaugural 
address he would not tolerate extremism in georgia and he 
proceeded to appoint more blacks to state office than any of his 
predecessors 
maddox also initiated a twicemonthly affair called little 
peoples day opening the doors of his office to anyone with a 
problem 
the law at that time did not allow governors to seek consecutive 
terms so at the end of four years maddox ran for and won the 
office of lieutenant governor ousting the incumbent 
but his popularity waned as he and jimmy carter who succeeded 
him as governor wrangled bitterly for four years and maddox lost 
a bid in 1974 to regain the governorship 
sixteen years later time seems to have done little to dull his 
exuberant personality sense of timing or love of oneliners 
a hearty handshake that pulls the other party offbalance long 
has been a maddox trademark it still was in force as he grabbed 
hands in the clayton county courthouse in suburban jonesboro often 
with a how you friend 
jurors deputies clerks lawyers searching deed titles all 
were fair game as he moved through the building like a typhoon 
several asked old lester how he was doing a typical reply 
im praying and loving and living and if you arent doing the 
first two you arent doing much of the third 
some asked if he brought his bicycle referring to his gimmick 
of riding a bicycle backwards 
not this time he told them 
the campaigning this day was in friendly territory places that 
16 years ago likely would have sported campaign signs proclaiming 
this is maddox country 
many remembered maddox including guy roundtree of riverdale 
hes a fine man roundtree said i voted for him when he was 
governor 
but there were a lot of blank stares too with 36 million of 
georgias estimated 64 million residents under the age of 34 that 
means 56 percent of the population wasnt even of voting age when 
maddox left office 
but he insisted he has a chance 
the people seem to be more unhappy more dissatisfied now 
than i have ever imagined or experienced they feel like theyre 
being left out and theres nobody fighting for them i think 
thats one of the strong things going for my candidacy he said 
maddox contended he is the only candidate with government 
experience who knows what to do with dollars how to spend em 
and how to use em and how to speak on behalf of outsiders 
theres no candidate likely to be elected governor other than 
myself who isnt a captive of the political establishment

americas industry uses more gears than 
foreign competitors and in 1984 it manufactured more of them too 
but a 170page study by the us international trade commission 
tells how this country turned into a major importer of gears 
in the period 19841988 imports increased more than 57 percent 
imports from japan the biggest supplier more than doubled 
the report tells of layoffs plant closings low spending on 
research on development and on new machinery us gearmakers 
increased earnings nearly twice as fast as sales but by the time 
they got done paying for the plant closings high interest rates 
and assets that lost their value the rise was only 11 percent 
there were a lot of mergers buyouts and joint ventures many 
of them by nonamerican companies a few american producers bought 
interests in other countries 
by 1988 us concerns could produce only 91 gears for every 100 
they could make a few years earlier 
its not a typical rust belt industry says michael bradley 
a professor of economics at george washington university 
theyve worked hard to acquire capital theyve increased 
their productivity and they make a real effort to keep their 
technological edge 
he said that unlike some other industries american gearmakers 
have not switched much of their own production to other countries 
to take advantage of lower wages 
bradley analyzed the report for the american gear manufacturers 
association he predicted the situation of the american industry 
would improve 
the report said the number of jobs in the us gearmaking 
industry dropped to 84600 in 1988 from 87800 in 1984 the average 
wage fell to 1787 an hour from 1817 when accounting for 
inflation 
wages for production workers in west germany are higher than 
in the united states the report said 
however west german companies offset the difference with 
higher productivity achieved in part through the use of newer 
faster machines and factory automation 
in 1984 us industry sold 246 million worth of gears in other 
countries beyond what it bought by 1988 it was buying 316 million 
worth more than it sold the us industry still led the world in 
knowhow about gears in space and in the air but west germany was 
the leader for cars trucks and ships and gears for cars are by 
far the biggest part of the industry 
during the four years the us industry increased its exports 
to 24 billion from 2 billion but imports rose more to 27 
billion from 17 billion they came from france and canada as well 
as from japan and west germany 
the commission said imports increased because american 
manufacturers bought cheaper goods from abroad west european and 
japanese producers made concerted and successful efforts to get 
into the us market and manufacturers of japanese cars in this 
country bought parts at home 
the strong dollar which made imports relatively cheaper in this 
country also was an element the dollar has weakened since 1985 
richard b norment executive director of the manufacturers 
association said in an interview that the effect of that may have 
started to appear at least the excess of imports over exports did 
not increase much in 1989 he said 
the us gearmaking industry increased spending on research and 
development from 53 million to 78 million but that was still 
less than 1 out of every 100 worth of gears shipped in 1985 
us universities spent less than 1 million on gear research 
while universities in west germany which has only a quarter of 
the us population spent 38 million and universities in japan 
less than half the us population spent 5 million 
in the period covered by the report us manufacturers spent 
264 million for new tools compared with 428 million for japanese 
manufacturers and 543 million for west german manufacturers 
us and foreign gearmaking machine tool builders selling in 
the us market indicate that the us industry is slow to adopt 
leading edge technology machinery the report said 
these sources cite as an explanation the shortterm management 
outlook lack of tax incentives high debt loads and pressure for 
frequent cost reductions common among us producers

tim robbins has a simple theory for whats 
ailing his character in cadillac man a queens cowboy riding 
shotgun with an ak47 
too much sugar too much caffeine is how he assesses the 
manic larry kosciuski hes out of control and what about the 
laidback video producer of tapeheads low energy the actor 
comments not enough sugar 
robbins is saying this as he digs into a kosciuskilike lunch 
consisting of a hamburger fries and caffeinerich soda but his 
demeanor is as mild as cottage cheese and with his wirerimmed 
glasses and short gelled hair its hard to imagine him as the 
triggerhappy kosciuski or womanizing nuke laloosh of bull 
durham 
questions about his private life are offlimits he lives with 
his bull durham costar susan sarandon and their baby son jack 
henry but he wont talk about them 
calm as he sits in an overstuffed brown chair his legs crossed 
a cigarette dangling in his right hand he sees nothing 
extraordinary about what he does insisting that kind of talk 
is only for magazines 
but robbins admits he didnt always feel that way determined at 
an early age to be an actor he wanted to attend new yorks high 
school of performing arts dreaming of immersing himself in a world 
of aspiring performers 
fortunately the actor says his father wouldnt let him 
i didnt understand what he meant at the time but now i 
realize what he was talking about the 32yearold actor recalled 
in an interview at his publicists manhattan offices 
i wanted to surround myself with people that are only 
interested in show business it would have limited my perceptions 
and input he said when you get to be 17 and go to college you can 
decide until then you need a basic education 
i learned so much about people and acting in courses like 
anthropology and psychology and history said robbins in a 
lot of ways the best way to study isnt to study acting its 
studying different worlds 
so off screen robbins is a selfdescribed active participant 
in the democratic process at ease with the local butcher and 
shoestore owner more likely to show up at knicks and rangers games 
than hollywood premieres 
on screen hes a lot flashier brawling with kevin costner in 
bull durham wrecking a beauty pagaent in miss firecracker 
crashing his motorcycle through the plateglass window of turgeon 
luxury auto sales in cadillac man 
again robbins was just following some good advice 
one of my teachers taught me the important lesson that any 
time you make an entrance to be a 100 percent possessed of your 
character in our training he would not let an actor enter unless 
he was completely in character and told a story 
it was two weeks before i could make an entrance and i started 
to understand the discipline one has to have in order to maintain 
that kind of commitment it especially helps in the waning hours 
when youre working at 2 in the morning 
robbins attended state university of new york then transferred 
to the theater program at the university of california at los 
angeles in 1981 he helped found the actors gang in los angeles 
and still is an active member recently directing and cowriting 
carnage which was staged in new york and los angeles 
for film hes had his greatest success playing dumb portraying 
characters with quick reflexes and slow minds laloosh is the 
perfect example a fastball pitcher and junk food eater robbins 
describes as a few seconds behind everyone else 
an exception was tapeheads when a bout with mononucleosis 
helped robbins prepare for his part 
i didnt even know it until a week before we ended shooting i 
was going around completely lethargic which is ok for that 
character i lucked out there i just want to say that thats my 
first and last mononucleic performance 
in you want to see the real tim robbins on screen or 
someone close to it the actor suggests checking out five 
corners in which he plays a man of constructive action a former 
street fighter inspired by the rev martin luther king jr to 
register voters in mississippi in the 1960s 
he remembers that film as his most enjoyable it was shot in new 
york the hours were reasonable the people friendly and the script 
by john patrick shanley moonstruck was in tune with his own 
beliefs 
i try not to do things that are gratuitously violent or 
sexist theres a lot of racism or sexism in scripts i read 
sometimes its just a line or two it shows me something about the 
sensitivity of the writer involved 
at the heart of it i want to know that the intentions are 
good that whats trying to be said is a positive thing 
robbins will work with the actors gang this summer and can next 
be seen on film in jacobs ladder a thriller directed by 
adrian lyne fatal attraction hes playing a smart fellow 
robbins says a guy with a phd 
and a good diet 
yes he said grinning and reached for another french fry

timber man jim colemans boot makes the 
same print in the forest floor as biologist ralph costas and both 
men call themselves environmentalists 
the similarities end when they talk about a humble little bird 
called the redcockaded woodpecker and the complex new rules to 
preserve a million acres of southern pine woods for the endangered 
creatures home 
three logging contracts signed by colemans small company were 
scrapped when the us forest service regulations changed to give 
the bird more space and he sees layoffs looming in the regions 
biggest industry 
if we were out there destroying the environment thatd be one 
thing says coleman whose callahan timber co planted more than 
1 million seedlings last year were at a loss we dont 
understand 
costa who oversees a program to save the woodpecker in the 
appalachicola national forest 200 miles away says timber interests 
alone must not drive decisions about federal woodlands 
public lands are going to be the last places that things 
survive pieces of the world whether its a woodpecker or a bald 
eagle he said theyre the bastions 
disagreement about the redcockaded woodpecker has generated 
legal briefs and government studies that now stack up well over the 
birds seveninch height 
the species named for the tiny badges of red plumage behind the 
males eyes has been on the endangered list since 1970 
perhaps 10000 birds remain the rest falling prey to flying 
squirrels snakes and even other woodpeckers that take over the 
cavities they painstakingly dig in living pine trees 
man often unwittingly has been the birds adversary too 
consuming much of their habitat parklike stands of old pines to 
nest in and enough surrounding woods to forage for insects find 
mates and expand their clans 
as the sun belts population has grown developers have turned 
woods into housing tracts loggers have replaced swaths of old 
forest with tree crops raised and cut in cycles 
and the government routinely has extinguished the fires caused 
by lightning that actually helped the woodpecker by burning out 
hardwoods that spring up beneath tall pines blocking nest cavities 
and giving predators easier access 
by far the largest factor has been clearcutting destruction 
of the habitat and suppression of fire says doug honnold of the 
sierra club legal defense fund 
the group accused the forest service in a lawsuit of 
jeopardizing the species in texas and in 1988 a judge agreed 
banning clearcutting and other timber industry methods within 
threequarters of a mile of woodpecker colony sites the case is on 
appeal 
after a similar suit was threatened concerning national forests 
in eight other southern states the agency last year applied a 
threequartermile protection zone to those areas too 
it then was the timber industrys turn to sue citing the forest 
services historic mandate to furnish a continuous supply of 
timber 
it also contended the agency had failed to fully implement 
earlier less restrictive guidelines for the bird and hadnt 
followed required procedures in changing the rules 
unfortunately were fighting procedure versus emotion says 
deborah baker of the atlantabased industry group that filed suit 
the forest service timber purchasers council 
the threequartermile radius encompasses 1100 acres thats 
12 million acres for all the known colonies compared with 502000 
restricted acres under the previous rules which set only a 
halfmile zone according to the american forest council in 
washington 
ron escano the forest service official in charge of protecting 
endangered species in the southeast says the acreage was added to 
give the birds space to expand colonies not merely maintain 
existing ones in all but three national forests that have the 
woodpeckers the population seemed to be declining under the old 
rules he says 
the new rules are interim measures while a twoyear 
environmental impact assessment is completed he says 
meanwhile escano insists timber cutting can occur within the 
current zones its just that it has to be designed to benefit 
the woodpecker 
asked about the industrys complaint that the new rules reduced 
timber harvests by a total of 73 million board feet this year and 
last escano says in relation to total volume cut its quite 
small 
he acknowledges however if you look at individual forests 
and individual operators it could be a very different story 
according to michael sparks a forest service timber sales 
official the impact will be greatest in coastal areas from east 
texas to north carolina 
in fiscal 1989 about 12 billion board feet of timber was cut 
on southeast national forests a drop from the previous five years 
the value fell to 768 million after hovering around 100 million 
annually through that period 
woodpecker protection is certainly not the only factor 
influencing volume but the new guidelines are being felt 
jim coleman doesnt know how much it cost callahan timber when 
three contracts for northern floridas osceola national forest were 
canceled and then renegotiated because of the rule change 
its really hurt the industry down here he says when you 
pull timber off the market then this timber has to be found 
somewhere and if it cant be found then these mills start 
shutting down 
one mill hes thinking of is a utilitypole operation owned 
jointly by callahan timber and richard cochran 
cochran echoes a complaint often heard in timbering areas that 
the bird is really a surrogate a tool for people who just 
dont want to cut any timber 
if we could reason with each other we should have enough 
middle ground he says 
no the time for compromise is over says gary henry who 
oversees redcockaded woodpecker preservation for the us fish and 
wildlife service thats whats been occurring for years 
hoping that this was adequate for the woodpecker its very obvious 
today that it is not adequate 
couldnt the industry simply turn to private lands for raw 
material 
there are 164 million acres of private timberland in the 
southeast many times the total national forest acreage according 
to the american forest council but much private land is less 
carefully managed and quality is often lower industry officials 
say 
ralph costa drives past miles of private timberlands paper 
company plantations on his commute to work in the appalachicola 
national forest home to 1000 or so of the woodpeckers more than 
anywhere else it doesnt bother him to see trees cut on private 
land 
but he says i dont think that national forests or any 
public lands for that matter should necessarily have an objective 
of producing a cash crop 
deer hunting is permitted to thin herds cutting a tree ought 
to be the same way we ought to take trees for the health of the 
ecosystem says costa whos often in the woods before dawn to 
band redcockadeds or move birds from his forest to others 
sometimes providing mates in colonies that have dwindled to a 
single bird 
people ask me whats the value of a woodpecker costa says 
answering with an analogy you can take a nice fancy spider web 
and start cutting the threads youre going to clip one thread 
eventually and the spider web is going to collapse 
and we can keep throwing species off the planet which were 
doing and eventually somethings going to go wrong

the redcockaded woodpecker once common in the southeast still 
ranges from texas to the carolinas but is found mainly in isolated 
populations on federal lands 
the birds live in small flocks called clans boring nesting 
holes in living pine trees about 60 or more years old the cluster 
of trees where the woodpeckers roost is called a colony 
according to the us forest service the greatest numbers of 
known active colonies are found in the appalachicola national 
forest in florida with 693 the kisatchie national forest in 
louisiana with 314 and the francis marion national forest in 
south carolina where the number dropped after hurricane hugo from

theres seldom been much mileage in vice 
presidential candidates as campaign issues but some democrats 
think that with dan quayle as their target they can make 1992 an 
exception 
nobody comes on stronger about making quayle a major issue than 
the man who lost the vice presidency to him last time damn 
right said sen lloyd m bentsen of texas if hes still on 
the ticket he will be 
president bush has said that quayle absolutely will be his 
running mate again in 1992 a commitment that overrules but has not 
quashed rumors of a possible switch 
a change wouldnt be bushs style he is committed long in 
advance he praises quayles performance as vice president and he 
puts a premium on loyalty 
nor are there promising precedents the last overhaul of a 
ticket that won was in 1944 when harry s truman became franklin 
d roosevelts vice presidential nominee 
dwight d eisenhower thought about a switch in 1956 suggesting 
to richard m nixon that he might be better off running the 
pentagon than serving as vice president as he prepared to seek the 
white house himself nixon knew better 
nixon considered john b connally as a secondterm running mate 
but didnt push it spiro t agnew was by then a conservative 
favorite and connally wasnt yet established as a republican 
president gerald r ford remodeled his appointed ticket in 1976 
dropping vice president nelson a rockefeller which placated 
conservative republicans ford ran and lost with sen robert j 
dole of kansas 
there is always midterm speculation about vice presidents their 
relationships with the boss and their prospects for the future 
thats a special problem for quayle who as nixon said starts 
from a low base and he would be the first to admit that 
quayle does but he also insists that the poll ratings reflect 
inaccurate perceptions not reality and that his standing is 
improving 
nixon who served two terms as vice president and got to pick 
three vice presidential nominees himself said in a television 
interview that quayle has taken all the criticism with pose with 
dignity 
in my view dan quayle will be on the ticket not just because 
george bush is loyal which he is perhaps to a fault but because 
he will not be a liability by the time the election rolls around 
nixon said 
bentsen predictably forecasts the opposite saying that voters 
will be paying more attention to quayle not less in the next 
national election 
they think here we go another cycle and a president hes 
mortal like all of us and we ought to be thinking again about this 
choice bentsen said 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine isnt so 
sure i think its too early to tell whether it can be used and 
what effect it would have mitchell says noting that there was 
no clear impact on the 1988 election 
republican pollster lance tarrance of houston said earlier this 
year that he thinks quayle could become a major issue and a 
significant problem for the republicans in 1992 tarrance said that 
as president bush seeks a second term voters will begin to focus 
on quayle as a potential president not only as an understudy 
perhaps so and perhaps it would turn some votes away from bush 
but it would have to be a tight race to make a discernible 
difference on election day unless quayle blundered into a new 
controversy its difficult to see how the democrats could hammer 
him any harder than they did in 1988 
as he campaigns for republican candidates in this years 
elections quayles standard response to recurring questions about 
his 1992 role is that the choice will be made by the president and 
that he is simply going to keep doing his job 
bush says he is doing it well so does sen richard g lugar 
whose name was on the guess lists in 1988 until bush chose his 
junior partner from indiana for the vice presidential nomination 
lugar said quayle does a good job but added that he isnt 
surprised at the persistent image problem its sort of hard to 
break the mold lugar said i think dan quayle understands 
that its not a shortterm problem

sponges algae and other ocean creatures are 
yielding new substances that hold promise as medicines against 
cancer psoriasis parasites and infectious diseases such as aids 
scientists say 
the search for drugs from the sea focuses on organisms that lack 
physical defenses and therefore must produce chemicals to protect 
themselves against predators said john faulkner a marine chemist 
at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla 
they dont have spines they dont have shells they cant 
run theyre just a blob on the reef and they look like food but 
theyre not eaten faulkner said when we see something like 
that we say aha this must be chemically protected 
manoalides a class of antiinflammatory drugs derived from 
sponges that live near palau in the north pacific now are being 
tested on humans with psoriasis an unsightly thickening of the 
skin that causes painful cracks and blistering 
manoalides could be on the market in three or four years and a 
few other drugs derived from marine creatures are expected within 
10 years said biochemist david attaway director of marine 
biotechnology for the national sea grant college program in silver 
spring md 
faulkner and attaway were among 35 scientists at a workshop on 
drugs from the sea this month at the university of california 
santa barbara 
increasingly scientists are turning to marine organisms in 
their search for new pharmaceuticals because of diminishing returns 
from continued screening of landbased plants and animals ucsb 
spokesman david salisbury said 
ucsb workshop participants reported they have identified 
marinederived drugs using funds from the sea grant program which 
attaway said has spent 700000 to 800000 per year on such 
research since 1977 
chemist phil crews of the university of california santa cruz 
extracted two compounds from sponges near fiji and vanuatu in the 
south pacific 
in testtube experiments the substances appeared effective in 
combatting tape worms and other parasites including some that 
plague cattle and sheep the chemicals also show some ability to 
fight viral diseases and one of them can inhibit the activity of 
an enzyme that lets the aids virus reproduce itself 
william fenical of scripps said a number of marine bacteria 
show promise as antibiotics 
jay burgess of ucsb is studying how calcium moves and is 
deposited inside red algae attaway said that might help scientists 
understand and treat diseases such as arthritis and lupus 
richard moore of the university of hawaii outlined efforts to 
use bluegreen algae to produce tumorfighting substances 
preliminary tests show a number of very active compounds 
attaway said 
faulkner said the government is investigating one substance 
derived from bluegreen algae as a possible antiaids medicine 
other substances purified from sea plants or animals are being 
developed as possible drugs to fight fungal infections faulkner 
said 
about 50 percent of the drugs in use at the moment are from 
natural sources mostly terrestrial he said and a large 
number of the ones that are synthetic started out as a compound 
that was from a natural source but then was modified and improved 
drugs developed from living organisms include many used for 
cancer chemotherapy as well as antibiotics derived from bacteria 
or fungi that were genetically altered he said 
some medicines were developed from sea creatures even before the 
sea grant program started its search in 1977 attaway said sponges 
yielded a class of compounds that have antitumor properties and 
also combat certain diseases caused by viruses including viral 
encephalitis a brain inflammation 
attaway said that compared with land organisms sea plants and 
animals yield a high number of novel substances that prove to 
have some effect on a biochemical or physiological process in 
another organism those are the processes you need to control to 
cure or control disease 
faulkner said scientists search for seaderived medicines partly 
by intuition plants or creatures that might have drugs are chopped 
up or soaked in alcohol to derive a crude extract which then is 
tested 
in perhaps 20 years scientists should be able to take cells 
from drugproducing sea organisms culture the cells in the 
laboratory and then manipulate the cells genes to make them 
efficient drug factories attaway said 
but like many scientists he complained that progress has been 
slowed by limits on funds due to inflation and federal budget 
restrictions drug companies have been slow to take up such 
research but their interest is increasing as many marine 
scientists trained with sea grant funds go to work in industry 
attaway said 
thats going to be the key to making this work really 
meaningful attaway said

victor yingst is on the trail of a 
killer on floridas palmshaded gulf coast 
he knows the stalkers methods by heart 
first the coconuts fall then the fronds turn a bright yellow 
and soon the tree is dead said yingst who has spent more than 
three years battling lethal yellowing disease for the lee county 
extension service 
after wiping out thousands of palms in the caribbean and 
southeastern florida the infestation is spreading into one of the 
last untouched regions for the majestic jamaican tall palm and 
other susceptible exotic species 
the insectcarried disease moving inland from beaches has 
agriculture experts fearing a recurrence of the palm dieoffs in 
southern florida in the 1970s tourism officials worry about a 
change in the tropical appeal of southeastern florida 
lethal yellowing is sort of like a fire said yingst if 
left unchecked it will spread farther and farther it could really 
rob this area of its special beauty 
although lethal yellowing has been studied for nearly 100 years 
there is no known cure but recently tree inoculations and 
plantings of resistant palms have helped somewhat to contain the 
disease caused by a cellular organism called mycoplasmas that live 
on the palm fronds soft core 
trees usually die within three to six months of showing the 
first symptoms of lethal yellowing 
the earliest known reference to a coconut tree disorder was made 
in 1834 on grand cayman island by the late 19th century 
scientists were examining lethal yellowing in jamaica where the 
coconut crop was a valuable export 
lethal yellowing jumped over to the florida keys in the 1950s 
and moved onto the mainland near miami in 1971 presently the 
disease has claimed about 200000 coconut palms and nearly 100000 
other species in florida as far north as jupiter about 80 miles 
from miami according to the university of florida 
in texas lethal yellowing has spread to date palms creating 
concern in the dategrowing regions of arizona and california 
overseas the disease ranges from west africa across the caribbean 
to mexicos yucatan peninsula 
what youre left with is a trunk like a telephone pole 
that just rots until it eventually falls over its really ugly 
said yingst 
as head of the lee county lethal yellowing control effort 
yingst has organized groups of residents and landscapers to monitor 
its progress and inject healthy trees with a tetracyclinebased 
antibiotic also resistant palms such as the popular malayan dwarf 
variety are being planted around healthy coconut palms as a buffer 
sherry marinello who operates a landscaping service said she 
has inoculated about 1300 trees in fort myers and fort myers 
beach where the disease was first spotted on the gulf coast 
to see a picture of what this place looked like two years ago 
and what it looks like now would shock you she said its a 
serious problem that could really change the character of this 
place if its not stopped

americans are getting only a third to half the 
calcium they need despite the calcium craze that sent people 
running to drugstores for pills to supplement their diets 
much has been made of calcium in recent years because of 
osteoporosis the weakening of the bones generally with age due 
to loss of calcium declining levels of sex hormones hereditary 
factors and other things 
women generally become susceptible at menopause men at a later 
age the disease is estimated to be responsible for more than 1 
million hip fractures each year 
a national institutes of health panel in 1984 recommended women 
consume a gram to 1 grams a day of calcium now there are dozens 
of supplements on the market and manufacterers have enriched a 
variety of foods with calcium 
still there is no clear proof that calcium will prevent the 
debilitating disease 
it remains a very controversial subject said bess 
dawsonhughes an endocrinologist at the calcium and bone 
metabolism laboratory at tufts universitys human nutrition 
research center 
the nih panel said calcium wont hurt and there is a 
reasonable chance it will help that message got twisted to if 
you take a gram to a gram and half you wont get osteoporosis 
she said 
several longterm studies are under way she said but until the 
data is in there are several variables including whether calcium 
affects people differently at different ages and whether it affects 
different bones differently 
calcium appears to have a bright and exciting future in 
preventive medicine and is being studied for connections to 
several diseases sheldon saul hendler wrote in the doctors 
vitamin and mineral encyclopedia 
but americans get only a third to half the calcium they need for 
good health according to hendler 
researchers from the university of michigan last month presented 
a study showing that eating calciumrich foods does not prevent 
osteoporosis the researchers compared hand xrays of men and women 
taken in 196365 and again in 1985 the subjects also reported 
their eating habits 
do not eat dairy products to prevent osteoporosis their 
protein content can accelerate the loss of calcium from bones 
dr andrew weil said in his book natural health natural 
medicine a better way to promote bone density is 
weightresistance exercises he said 
calcium is needed to build strong bones and teeth and helps 
regulate nerve and muscle function among other things severe 
deficiency can lead to abnormal heartbeat dementia muscle spasms 
and convulsions hendler writes 
dairy products are the main source of calcium in the diet for 
those who are lactose intolerant or for other reasons dont eat 
dairy calcium can be had from kale or collard greens molasses 
sesame seeds salmon broccoli yogurt and tofu 
a cup of milk has 290 milligrams of calcium four ounces of tofu 
contain 154 milligrams 
young women on weightreducing diets often stop eating dairy 
products though skim milk is as good a provider of calcium as 
whole milk bone mass development is at its peak from ages 18 to 
25 yet surveys show that at least a quarter of the women in this 
age group consume less than 300 milligrams a day of calcium 
the average americans diet supplies 600 to 800 milligrams of 
calcium a day said richard mazess professor emeritus of medical 
physics at the university of wisconsin 
while there appears to be no major risk in following the nih 
panels 1984 advice dawsonhughes noted that if calcium is not 
effective research time and money should be used another way 
calcium supplements also cost money so if its not doing 
anything its real important to know that she said

engineers who practice the korean 
martial art tae kwon do used a mechanical leg and videotapes of 
sparring sessions to conclude that currently accepted protective 
gear is inadequate 
the study found that a tae kwon do kick can carry the same 
energy as a major league fastball racing at 90 mph and can cave in 
a persons chest by as much as two inches creating a high risk of 
internal injuries 
the study was conducted by university of california berkeley 
mechanical engineering professor dennis lieu who twice needed 
hospital attention after keeling over from tae kwon do blows even 
though he was wearing protective gear his coauthor was 
engineering student and 1989 national collegiate taekwondo champion 
elaine serina 
tae kwon do originally was taught for warfare selfdefense and 
fitness it has gained wide popularity as a competitive sport and 
was introduced as a demonstration event at the 1988 olympics in 
south korea 
lieu and serina used highspeed videotape to record a sparring 
session between them then analyzed the tapes at slow speed 
i remember asking her to kick me so we could have it on 
tape lieu recalled she did and i bent over in pain and wound 
up on the floor 
the engineers then developed a mechanical leg to recreate tae 
kwon do kicks under laboratory conditions using torso models 
similar to those used in automobile crash experiments 
they concluded existing protective gear is much too soft and 
needs to be more rigid in critical areas to adequately protect 
against internal injuries

cigarette smoking dropped 2 percent 
during the first year of an antitobacco advertising campaign in 
two australian cities suggesting a similar effort in california 
will succeed a researcher says 
that may not sound like a tremendous drop but it is said 
john p pierce an associate professor of community and family 
medicine at the university of california san diego 
the same reduction in the united states would mean hundreds of 
thousands fewer smokers said pierce who studied the effectiveness 
of the australian television advertising blitz while working at the 
university of sydney 
pierces study was published in the may issue of the american 
journal of public health he presented the unpublished findings to 
californias legislature last august helping persuade lawmakers to 
spend cigarette tax money for a 286 million media campaign that 
was launched april 10 
the australian campaign is the prototype for the california 
campaign pierce said if the campaign can achieve similar 
results here it means there would be 660000 fewer smokers in 
california by mid1991 
tv commercials that focused on the health hazards of smoking 
aired during prime time for six to eight weeks each year starting 
in 1983 in sydney and 1984 in melbourne 
pierce and his colleagues surveyed 20000 residents of sydney 
and melbourne they found the 2 percent drop in smoking one year 
after the campaign started in subsequent years smoking among 
australian men dropped an additional 1 percent per year but 
didnt drop further among women a difference pierce said isnt 
yet understood 
before joining ucsd in january pierce worked at the us 
centers for disease control as chief epidemiologist in the office 
on smoking and health

doctors are starting to use thigh tissue to 
rebuild breasts for women who underwent mastectomy due to breast 
cancer 
silicone implants now are the most common form of breast 
reconstruction followed by the transplant of skin fat and muscle 
taken from the abdomen and buttocks 
but three atlanta plastic surgeons say thigh flaps or 
tissue taken from the thighs also can be used 
some women would prefer to have excess tissue removed from their 
thighs than from their abdomen or buttocks others might need to 
use the thigh tissue method said l franklyn elliott one of the 
surgeons who reported on the new method earlier this year in the 
journal plastic and reconstructive surgery 
some women may be unable to have their abdominal tissue used 
either because they dont have enough or because they have 
abdominal scars from previous surgery elliott said the thighs 
have longer veins and arteries than buttock tissue providing 
better blood flow to the reconstructed breast he added 
dr william shaw head of plastic surgery at the university of 
california los angeles cautions that use of thigh flaps has 
drawbacks fatty tissue isnt as consistently plentiful in the 
thighs as in the buttocks so the use of thigh flaps poses a risk 
of creating deformities in the thighs or of making one thigh 
appear smaller than the other he said 
elliott replied that as surgeons become more experienced using 
thigh flaps they will become more skilled in using liposuction and 
other methods to minimize disfigurement and to match the two thighs 
generally my patients who have chosen breast reconstruction 
using thigh flaps have preferred the resulting deformity to the 
saddlebags they had before he said

the supermarket tabloids are being devoured 
the globe national examiner and sun are the latest gossipy 
weeklies about to fall under new ownership 
the muchlarger national enquirer and its sister publication 
weekly world news were bought out last year star magazine is in 
the process of changing owners 
industry analysts were hardpressed to find a common link among 
the sales however the national enquirer was sold after its 
founder died star no longer fit the strategic plans of rupert 
murdochs news corp 
the latest acquisition would give british media baron robert 
maxwell a chance to put his experience with tabloids in europe to 
work in the united states 
maxwell said wednesday his mirror group newspapers ltd has 
agreed to buy the globe national examiner and sun from globe 
international publishing inc 
terms were not disclosed but industry executives said the three 
magazines could command somewhere between 100 million and 200 
million 
globe international a privatelyheld publishing concern based 
in montreal said the combined circulation of the three magazines 
exceeds 25 million 
only last year the much larger national enquirer and weekly 
world news were sold for 4125 million to a group that included 
macfadden holdings inc a media investment firm and boston 
ventures management 
the new owners of that company known as gp group inc of 
lantana fla subsequently agreed in late march to buy star from 
news corp for 400 million in cash and stock 
the national enquirer has a circulation of more than 41 million 
while star ranks second among supermarket tabloids at 36 million 
weekly world news sells nearly 850000 copies a week 
the globe international tabloids whcih are published in boca 
raton fla would be maxwells first magazines in the united 
states where his main interest has been book publishing and 
information services 
but his mirror group plc publishes the daily mirror the united 
kingdoms second largest newspaper its other british newspapers 
include sporting life and the daily record and the sunday mail in 
scotland 
mirror group also recently launched the european an 
englishlanguage weekend newspaper for europe 
maxwell reportedly lost out in bidding for the national enquirer 
the globe and the national examiner each have been published for 
about 35 years the globe originated as a local entertainment 
magazine in montreal called midnight while the national examiner 
had its roots in the midwest according to globe international 
spokesman dean heine 
he said mike rosenbloom the owner of globe international 
acquired both the globe and national examiner about 20 years ago 
rosenbloom started sun about nine years ago 
the audit bureau of circulations said globe had an average 
circulation of 133 million in the six months ended dec 31 down 
129 percent from a year earlier while national examiner averaged 
nearly 894000 down 202 percent 
the bureau does not audit circulation figures for sun but heine 
said its circulation is about 450000 a week 
heine said the three magazines emphasize entertainment and 
generally have moved away from the gruesome stories that once 
characterized the supermarket tabloids 
in the current edition of globe the cover features photos of 
actresses vanna white and linda evans to accompany a featured story 
alleging they are in a bitter battle for the same man 
the national examiner has cover stories claiming that former 
evangelist jim bakker is going insane and describing the plight of 
a tourist whose prosthetic plastic nose melted in the florida heat 
jesus back on earth say scholars reads another cover 
headline 
david adler a spokesman for maxwell said it is too early to 
say what maxwells plans are for the three tabloids 
the sale will leave globe international with several 
publications distributed mainly in supermarkets and convenience 
stores including socalled minimags that feature calorie counters 
or horoscopes 
it also publishes bridal guide the humor magazine cracked and 
your health magazine as well as detective magazines and puzzle 
books

northrop corp added to the litany of woes 
for californias aerospace industry by announcing it would trim its 
workforce by 7 percent because of defense spending cuts on its b2 
bomber 
the company said it would eliminate 3000 jobs by the end of the 
year including 2700 in southern california through layoffs and 
attrition 
the cuts followed similar moves by mcdonnell douglas corp and 
lockheed corp and are expected to reverberate through thousands of 
smaller firms in the industry 
world events government decisions economic conditions are 
all evolving at a rapid rate at an unprecedented rate chief 
executive kent kresa said in announcing the layoffs 
questions are being asked about fundamental assumptions that 
have not been questioned since many of us here were children he 
said in remarks prepared for northrops annual meeting wednesday 
the radardodging batwinged stealth bomber made up 58 percent 
of northrops 128 billion in firstquarter sales this year 
but because of easing world tensions defense secretary dick 
cheney has proposed cutting purchases of the bomber from 132 to 75 
peak production would fall from 36 planes a year to 12 
the partys over theres going to be some pain said jack 
kyser a chamber of commerce economist 
last week mcdonnell douglas said it would cut 4000 jobs mostly 
in long beach and lockheed announced it would shut down in 
burbank eliminating 4500 local jobs over the next few years 
kyser said northrop may have decided it was best to announce its 
layoffs on the heels of bad news from the other companies 
it may be the idea that the rain is already falling he 
said theyre in sort of a batten down the hatches survival mode 
anyway 
the layoffs could create a ripple effect through the aerospace 
industry the greatest source of manufacturing jobs in the region 
kyser said 70 percent of the areas aerospace companies employ 50 
or fewer workers kresa noted that northrop has 6000 
subcontractors and suppliers in the region 
on our major programs today northrop as prime contractor is 
responsible for only 30 or 40 percent of the work 60 to 70 percent 
is done by our subcontractors and suppliers kresa said they 
also will be among the first to feel the effects of budget 
reductions and stretchouts 
northrops employment peaked at 48200 at the end of 1987 it 
has cut 2500 employees during the past year and now has about 
41000 workers 
kresa also said northrop can eliminate its 1 billion in debt by 
the mid1990s through costcutting and sale of assets he cited the 
recent sale and partial leaseback of its corporate headquarters 
complex which produced an aftertax gain of 90 million and cut 
the companys shortterm debt by 218 million 
kresa also set a goal for northrop which lost 635 million 
last year or returning to the 20 percent returnonequity level it 
achieved in the mid80s 
i was impressed by his comments said lawrence harris a 
securities analyst with bateman eichler hill richards in los 
angeles the 20 percent returnonequity goal is certainly 
ambitious but its the kind of target the street would be looking 
for on a longterm basis 
kresa said the slowdown in the b2 program would allow northrop 
to proceed with fullscale development of the advanced tactical 
fighter at its ultramodern pico rivera plant next year if the 
company wins the contract on the nextgeneration fighter a 
northropled team is competing with a lockheedled team 
harris said that statement suggests northrop is studying the 
possible sale of all or part of its hawthorne facility where it 
does subcontracting work on boeing 747s he estimated the 218 acres 
of land there is worth 114 million and the buildings another 296 
million 
another possible target is a ventura county plant that produces 
targets and drones and has worked to develop the tacit rainbow 
missile harris said the missile will be produced in georgia and 
many engineering tasks already have been moved to hawthorne he 
estimated the ventura land and buildings could fetch 130 million

circle k corp has become the nations latest 
retailer to seek bankruptcy court protection after being unable to 
pay off a huge debt incurred during a rapid expansion program 
the nations secondlargest convenience store chain said 
wednesday it resorted to a chapter 11 filing after failing to reach 
agreement with creditors on a plan to work out its debt problems 
the filing surprised some analysts because circle k last month 
halted interest payments to bondholders under a tentative 
debtrestructuring agreement with senior creditors and its largest 
shareholder american financial corp the agreement included a 
moratorium on senior debt payments through oct 31 
but circle k spokesman ray cox said some senior creditors balked 
at signing the standstill agreement he declined to say which 
lenders threw the company into bankruptcy but said american 
financial was not among them the cincinnatibased company owns 
383 percent of circle ks stock 
i think most people felt that since they had been given until 
october by their shortterm creditors they would put together a 
restructuring plan and come out of it said dennis telzrow an 
analyst with eppler guerin amp turner of dallas 
circle k listed 194 billion in assets and 158 billion in 
liabilities including 9932 million in secured and unsecured 
debts to 711 creditors the other liabilities were claims by about 
47000 creditors mostly suppliers to circle k stores 
the company isnt alone with its debt woes 
ames department stores and the department stores owned by 
campeau corp are reorganizing under chapter 11 struggling with 
debt taken on through takeovers debt problems forced southland 
which has about 7000 7eleven stores to agree to sell a 
controlling interest to japans 7eleven franchiser 
telzrow said investors faith in management may have been shaken 
during five years of unrelenting expansion under former chairman 
karl eller who resigned eight days before the chapter 11 filing 
late tuesday 
he said it is possible creditors might ask us bankruptcy judge 
george b nielsen jr to appoint a trustee to run the company 
when eller took over in mid1983 circle k had 1200 stores in 
11 states with annual sales of 750 million by last november it 
had grown to a peak of 4685 stores in 33 states and 1386 licensed 
or jointventure stores in 13 foreign countries revenues last year 
totaled 35 billion 
the company incurred about 13 billion in debt to finance its 
expansion mainly highinterest junk bonds annual interest 
payments exceeded 100 million 
eller tried to sell circle k last summer but got nowhere and he 
came up short in his attempt at a leveraged buyout 
two months ago circle k announced a 42 million operating loss 
in the quarter ended jan 31 
company attorneys met wednesday with the bankruptcy judge but 
cox said he could not comment on the talks he said company 
attorneys didnt know when they would have a reorganization plan 
ready 
president robert dearth jr said circle k stores and warehouses 
would operate as usual he said the company was optimistic about 
receiving cooperation from its vendors 
circle k has announced plans to sell 350 stores in the pacific 
northwest and another 25 in hawaii but neither sale has closed 
those sales now would need the approval of the bankruptcy court to 
proceed 
circle k now operates about 4641 stores in 32 states plus the 
foreign stores

the state claimed victory in its fight to 
maintain competition at the grocery counter after californias 
largest supermarket chain agreed to sell most of its alpha beta 
stores to settle antitrust charges 
wednesdays decision by american stores co of salt lake city 
ended a 1year legal battle with california authorities over its 
25 billion acquisition of the lucky supermarket chain 
it also follows a key us supreme court ruling last month that 
allowed the state to sue the company to overturn the merger 
previously it had been widely assumed states and citizens could 
not interfere with deals once they were completed 
american stores did not admit that the takeover was 
anticompetitive and said it agreed to the settlement to avoid any 
more costly legal battles 
it is evident the time required and disruption caused by 
further litigation with the attorney general would only serve to 
create great confusion and uncertainty for employees shareholders 
and lenders said jl scott chief executive of american stores 
attorney general john van de kamp who had contended the merger 
would hurt competition in the supermarket business hailed the 
agreement 
this is wonderful news for california consumers struggling to 
stretch their grocery dollar said van de kamp 
under the terms of a consent decree american stores will 
continue to operate lucky but within the next five years must 
sell 152 of alpha betas 175 stores in southern california it also 
will convert nine alpha betas into lucky stores and sell nine lucky 
stores 
van de kamp said americans operation of the remaining 14 alpha 
beta stores would not hurt competition 
american stores also agreed to pay 550000 to the attorney 
generals office to cover a portion of the attorneys fees and other 
costs 
the agreement was approved by us district judge david w 
kenyon in los angeles who would have presided over a trial 
the deal puts no restrictions on american stores future growth 
in california and doesnt require the attorney general to approve 
of the buyer price or terms of the sale of the stores 
scott said american stores expected to receive full value for 
the alpha beta stores in 1989 the 161 stores subject to divesture 
earned 325 million on sales of 18 billion 
american stores completed the purchase of dublin califbased 
lucky stores inc in may 1988 to create the states largest grocery 
store chain with more than 500 stores and annual sales of more than 
20 billion 
four months later van de kamp sued to block the merger on 
grounds it was anticompetitive american had contended the deal 
would ultimately help consumers because alpha beta stores would 
adopt luckys lowprice policies 
but a federal court forbade the joint operation of lucky and 
alpha beta until the matter could be resolved in court 
in april the us supreme court voted 90 to empower van de 
kamp to sue to undo the merger 
wednesdays agreement marked a political victory for van de 
kamp who is running against former san francisco mayor dianne 
feinstein for the democratic gubernatorial nomination 
the deal only affects alpha beta stores in southern california 
in an earlier deal between american stores and the state american 
stores agreed to sell 13 of alpha betas northern california stores 
and integrate the other 23 into luckys chain

the sale of a van gogh for a record 825 
million bodes well for tonights auction of a renowned renoir 
painting but collectors arent spending so freely for less 
significant works art experts said 
renoirs depiction of an openair dance hall in montmartre au 
moulin dela galette is to be auctioned at sothebys 
on tuesday night van goghs portrait of dr gachet was the 
highlight of a contemporary art sale at christies drawing a 
record bid from a japanese gallery 
when you have a tremendous painting like the van gogh or the 
renoir thats coming up thursday night youre going to get 
extraordinary prices said milton esterow editor and publisher 
of artnews 
buyers are being selective however and only the most highly 
prized works inspire frenzied bidding 
even with the van gogh christies entire sale brought a total 
of 2694 million although that was only 67000 under the record 
for an art auction held by sothebys 24 of the 81 offerings did 
not sell and some that did went for significantly less than their 
presale estimate 
i think tuesday night showed that the market is correcting 
to a more realistic level esterow said 
the renoir is estimated by sothebys to sell for 40 to 50 
million the same presale estimate as the van gogh its owner is 
betsey cushing whitney the widow of john hay whitney the 
financier publisher sportsman and former ambassador to britain 
the large canvas captures an afternoon crowd of revelers beneath 
a lush canopy of acacia trees at an openair dance hall in 
montmartre that was popular in the artists day 
with the van gogh taking such an unprecedented leap into 82 
million that perhaps the other collectors will have to follow suit 
and put their estimates a little bit higher as far as the whitney 
picture is concerned said harry brooks director of the 
wildenstein gallery in manhattan 
the winning bid for dr gachet was placed by hideto 
kobayashi of the gallery of kobayashi of tokyo the gallery won a 
heated bidding contest with an unidentified european buyer 
represented by charles allsopp chairman of christies in london 
the japanese play a major role in the impressionist and 
postimpressionist art market and accounted for a third of the 
activity in the auction room said michael j findlay who heads 
the impressionist and modern art sales for christies americans 
and europeans represented the other two thirds he said 
five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold at auction have 
been bought by japanese collectors including pablo picassos 
pierrettes wedding purchased in 1987 for 513 million and 
van goghs sunflowers bought in 1987 for 399 million 
the strong japanese presence is attributed by art experts to the 
wealth in japan bolstered the yens rise against the dollar in 
recent years also japan has a tradition since the 1930s of 
collecting impressionist art 
van gogh was an artist who was unabashedly an admirer of 
japanese art and prints said findlay many of the 
impressionists notions of composition like the flattened 
perspective and color come directly from japan he said 
david nash senior vice president in charge of fine arts at 
sothebys in new york said japanese collectors had made inquiries 
about au moulin de la galette 
i have no predictions to make about what will happen to the 
renoir nash said obviously it is encouraging to see that a 
major 19th century painting can bring such a high price he said 
of the van gogh 
renoir paintings have not fetched the top prices that van goghs 
works have the highest price paid for a renoir was 177 million 
in april 1989 for la promenade it was bought by the j paul 
getty museum until tuesday night the highest price ever paid for 
a painting at auction was 539 million for van goghs irises 
esterow noted that substantially more renoirs have been on the 
market and that their quality is less consistent 
but findlay of christies said au moulin de la galette was 
special 
there hasnt been a renoir of that quality so we dont know 
what the market will say about it he said

capitol hill democrats say president bush 
lacks leadership and could doom the budget summit because of his 
refusal to outline publicly the severity of the nations budget 
problems 
this congress wont be able to act unless the american people 
feel theres a crisis said rep charles schumer dny 
theres only one person who can show the american people how bad 
the crisis is 
this country is crying for leadership said rep marty 
russo dill calling on bush to cash in some of his popularity 
for the good of the nation you dont get to be great by making 
no decisions he said 
the president said wednesday he turned down a democratic 
suggestion that he make a nationally televised address to explain 
why he called the summit on the budget deficit the democrats are 
campaigning to make sure he shares the blame for any tax increase 
that results 
i dont want to inadvertently send the wrong signals to the 
markets bush said wednesday he said he would wait to make such 
an address later when he could present a bipartisan solution to 
the problem 
rep bill frenzel rminn said democrats were merely pushing 
bush to do a jimmy carter referring to the former presidents 
unpopular penchant of reminding the nation of its problems 
its not a crisis its a manageable problem frenzel said 
wednesday after a meeting with white house budget director richard 
darman and other members of the house budget committee 
in the closeddoor session darman continued his effort to 
convince lawmakers that strong action must be taken to reduce the 
deficit darman refused to appear before the committee in open 
session 
the budget summit talks were scheduled to resume this afternoon 
with more discussion of the fiscal forecast for 1991 
under the grammrudman law the deficit for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 must be cut to no more than 74 billion or 
automatic spending cuts will be imposed to make up the difference 
the projected deficit which the administration put near 100 
billion four months ago could be twice that if costs for the 
bailout of the savings and loan industry are included not counting 
the sampl capital and the administration doesnt want it counted 
the deficit still would be 123 to 138 billion 
so to avoid the huge automatic cuts congress and the president 
must agree on around 50 billion in spending cuts and tax increases 
the president is the only one who can build public acceptance of 
the necessary sacrifices and he has to start soon democrats said 
he has to start now to sell the dimensions of the problem and 
go before the people to talk about the seriousness of it said 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee it should be a major address to the american people 
the longer he waits the more difficult it will be 
he cant wait to do that the night before the vote in a 
fireside chat said rep dale kildee dmich he has to lead 
he has to govern 
kildee said he understood the president was already feeling 
pressure from his own republicans because of his wavering on the 
no new taxes pledge 
i think hes torn between the politics and the governance 
he said and i hope he leans more toward governance 
the presidents news conference wednesday was aimed at 
pressuring congress to approve aid for central america 
the presidents priorities are out of skew when hes focusing 
on nicaragua and panama but will not use the same public media in 
order to try to describe what the problems are with our own 
economy said rep david obey dwis

the us trade deficit jumped 385 percent to 
845 billion in march as record exports were offset by the second 
highest level of imports the government reported today 
despite the widened gap in march the deficit still was below 
the average 90 billion monthly imbalance in 1989 and many 
economists say the gap which has improved each year since peaking 
in 1987 should continue to narrow this year 
commerce secretary robert a mosbacher noting that the 239 
billion firstquarter trade deficit was the lowest in more than six 
years said in a statement he expects the gap to total less than 
100 billion this year it was 109 billion in 1989 
the commerce department said a 46 percent increase in exports 
in march to 3328 billion was offset by a 10 percent gain in 
imports to 417 billion second only to the record 419 billion 
set last october 
the trade deficit is the difference between what america imports 
and what it sells abroad 
the imbalance had narrowed to a revised 61 billion in 
february the smallest deficit in six years and was down 346 
percent from a 932 billion gap january the february gap first 
was reported to have been 649 billion 
many analysts had been expecting a deficit of about 78 billion 
in march up from the february level but still well below the 9 
billion monthly average last year 
the news was sure to attract attention at the white house and on 
capitol hill where negotiators were studying compromise spending 
cuts and possible tax hikes to reduce the budget deficit 
trade improvements are seen as an essential part of any effort 
to spur economic growth and stem the widening gap between what the 
government receives and what it spends 
the jump in exports from 318 billion was led by automobiles 
industrial supplies and foods feeds and beverages it was pulled 
down by a decline in aircraft shipments which had boosted the 
february export level 
imports were up from 379 billion in february led by 
automobiles capital goods consumer goods and industrial supplies 
the 10 percent gain was the largest since a 218 percent advance in 
september 1985 
oil imports totaled 261 million barrels up 74 percent from 
february but prices fell from 1939 a barrel to 1818 a barrel 
in march making the 47 billion import bill virtually the same as 
the previous month 
as usual the deficit with japan was the largest of any country 
it totaled 36 billion followed by china and taiwan 600 million 
each mexico and brazil 300 million each and canada 100 
million the united states posted a 700 million surplus with the 
countries of western europe 
the trade deficit hit 15212 billion in 1987 and then dropped 
to 11853 billion the following year the 1989 deficit slid 
further to 109 billion 
i think the deficit for 90 will show a significant 
improvement over 1989 said senior economist bruce steinberg of 
merrill lynch capital markets in new york it will get down to 
about 95 billion or so maybe even better than that 
economists at fuji securities inc in chicago also forecast 
continued improvement they expect the average monthly gap in the 
first quarter to total about 76 billion down from 91 billion 
during januarymarch 1989 
steppedup export demand stemming from vibrant economic growth 
abroad plus reduced import demand caused by sluggish domestic 
growth should assure further reductions in the deficit in coming 
quarters they say 
elias bikhazi money market economist at security pacific 
national bank in los angeles said softer import growth should 
help cut the deficit to a bit below 100 billion this year 
oil imports however remain troubling domestic oil production 
now is at a 25year low and many analysts expect both foreign oil 
shipments and prices to rise in coming months 
the administration is counting on further trade improvements to 
dampen growing protectionist pressures in congress as well as to 
bolster economic growth 
a sluggish economy already has cut government tax receipts and 
together with high interest rates is threatening to drive up 
further the already raging federal budget deficit 
as a result president bush and congressional leaders began 
negotiations earlier this week on a package of spending cuts and 
revenue increases to forestall the automatic spending cuts for 
fiscal 1991 under the grammrudman balanced budget law

the narrowing of japans trade surplus interrupted 
in march after an 11month stretch resumed in april the finance 
ministry announced thursday 
the ministry said japans exports exceeded its imports by 354 
billion in april compared with 729 billion a year earlier 
in trade with the united states the surplus shrank from 454 
billion to 245 billion 
the surplus measured when goods pass through customs had 
expanded in march from yearearlier levels because of unusually 
high imports in march 1989 just before imposition of a new 3 
percent sales tax 
the amount of the surplus narrowing in april was exaggerated by 
the particularly large surplus in april last year when imports 
fell sharply after the tax was imposed 
the ministry said the basic trend of declining surpluses was 
continuing regardless of the distorting effects of the tax on 
comparisons with 1989 
japan has been under pressure from the united states and other 
trading partners to shrink its large surpluses 
in various negotiations this year japan has agreed to open its 
market wider to us satellites supercomputers and forest 
products and to boost public works spending tighten antimonopoly 
rules reform its distribution system and combat corporate groups 
exclusionary trade practices 
japans global exports in april totaled 2187 billion down 58 
percent from a year earlier imports rose 15 percent to 1833 
billion 
japans exports to the united states amounted to 672 billion 
in april down 149 percent from april 1989 while imports from the 
united states increased by 268 percent to 427 billion 
exports of automobiles meanwhile dropped 191 percent in april 
to 371 billion japanese automakers have been boosting their 
production overseas

companys plan for keeping in touch with the troops 
im impressed with the way the team operates said harlan 
53 who wore a seaman apprentice nametag with len printed on 
it it gives me an appreciation into what you do in one of these 
shops 
castle harlan inc is one of two new york investment firms 
involved in the managementled leveraged buyout of jerrico inc 
the parent company of long john silvers the other owner is 
djsinverness and co 
in contrast to other takeovers that have succumbed to heavy 
debts lexingtonbased jerrico has thrived since its 620 million 
buyout 
we take fundamentally sound companies and expand from that 
base said harlan who added that operating cash flow is up 20 
percent over last year our philosophy is we build companies we 
get the energy released inside the company we take the lid off 
harlan castle also owns peasant restaurants of atlanta and 
mortons of chicago ethan allen furniture company delaware 
management co a moneymanagement firm and reagan outdoor a 
billboard company 
jerrico has streamlined operation reducing costs by 16 million 
in corporate administration and 14 million at the restaurants 
since the buyout it also eliminated about 200 regional and 
corporate jobs 
we didnt look for the quick buck jerrico president john e 
tobe who also worked a shift at a long john silvers in atlanta 
we had longterm planning i think thats what made this lbo a 
success 
lbos work best when operations are trimmed to the best 
performers and other assets are sold off to cover financing costs 
in jerricos case the company recently announced agreements to 
sell two restaurant chains jerrys to great american restaurants 
inc of atlanta and fazolis to seed restaurant group inc a 
japaneseowned firm the prices were not disclosed 
jerrico also owns two familystyle italian restaurants called 
florenz which it plans to sell 
we want to focus solely on long john silvers said tobe 
who has been with jerrico for 16 years the past six as president 
and chief executive officer 
long john silvers has about 62 percent of the 12 billion 
quickservice seafood restaurant business jerrico owns about 
twothirds of the 1500 restaurants and the rest are franchised 
the chain operates in 35 states the district of columbia 
canada and singapore 
since the buyout there has been an aggressive management 
campaign to give long john silvers a more contemporary image 
television ads began feb 26 to promote the restaurants as 
makin a splash with its seafood products 
it is a theme that employed the upbeat nature of the 
business said harlan we are an upbeat business 
the restaurants are being remodeled giving the buildings fresh 
appearances with bright yellow on dark blue paint and large cupolas 
with beacons to attract customers 
the buildings were historically gray like kentucky state 
police cruisers said tobe state police cruisers are gray so 
they can go unnoticed our buildings ended up doing the same we 
want to have the units pop out at you 
the menu has been expanded to include baked and broiled seafood 
for the healthconscious consumer and finger foods several items 
will be introduced for a limited time this summer 
the company also plans to increase the percentage of its 
restaurants with drivethrough service from the current 35 percent 
to 65 percent install large bright menu boards and improve plates 
and packaging 
the company went from very traditional very methodical to 
one overnight of innovation said bill mahony executive vice 
president operations 
jerrico recently sold four long john silvers in phoenix to 
american seafood partners one of its largest franchisees the 
agreement also calls for the buyer to develop 16 new franchised 
units in the phoenix area within the next three years and another 
16 in markets yet to be chosen 
the company also is looking to add 200 franchised units within 
five years in established markets and expand into the northeast and 
northwest where it has almost no presence tobe said 
were aggressively going after new franchisees he said 
we also hope company employees can become franchisees 
the company recently offered stock appreciation rights to 3000 
employees starting with assistant managers which will let them 
benefit from the appreciation of the value of jerricos stock now 
held by senior managers and investors in the buyout 
the company is theirs said harlan we want an 
entrepreneurial spirit we want to produce independent thought 
in 1989 before the buyout jerrico had a different focus in 
remembering the 20th year of long john silvers 
on the 20th anniversary we celebrated our age said anthony 
m lavely executive vice president for marketing now eight 
months later were celebrating our future our youth and our 
desire to do new things

pacificorp the portland orebased utility 
giant today increased to 182 billion its offer to acquire 
arizonas largest utility pinnacle west capital corp 
pacificcorp also agreed to assume all of the debt of pinnacle 
west and its subsidiary arizona public service co as part of the 
offer 
steve carr a pinnacle west spokesman said the companys board 
of directors would seriously consider the offer 
pinnacle wests board rejected three previous offers from 
pacificorpthe last offer worth about 17 billion was rejected 
in march as inadequate 
under the new offer pinnacle west shareholders would received 
21 in cash for each share of stock they hold at the time of the 
acquisition pinnacle west stock sold for 1275 at the close of 
trading wednesday 
we think it is time to bring to a conclusion pacificorps 
expressions of interest to you pacificorp president and 
chief executive officer am gleason said in a letter delivered 
thursday to richard snell chairman of pinnacle west 
our offer remains the same with regard to customers of arizona 
public service rate increases limited to 2 percent per year for 
four years 
this is significantly less than the rate relief requested in 
apss most recent filing with the arizona corporation commission 
rate increases of 65 percent per year for three years 
pacificorp has said it wants the arizona utility so that it 
could conduct seasonal transfers of excess power between arizona 
where power use peaks in the summer and the pacific northwest 
where power use peaks in the winter 
gleason said the deal would delay into the next decade any need 
for pacificorp to build additional power plants to meet peak 
demands 
pacificorp has electric utility operations in seven western 
states 
prior to receiving the offer snell was not enthusiastic about a 
deal 
if theres another offer well take a look at it snell 
said but our position is that this is not a good time to sell 
and the company is not for sale 
on the other hand weve given serious consideration to the 
other offers and we will again if one comes our way

chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca pleaded with stockholders today to stick with the automaker 
despite falling profits and stock price saying it is poised to 
take on japanese and american competitors in the 1990s 
iacocca addressing the companys annual meeting acknowledged 
that earnings have been very disappointing but counseled them to 
take a long view he noted that the yearly dividend of 120 per 
share was about a 7 percent yield at the stock price of about 17 
today 
barring a disaster maybe a nuclear disaster we dont 
anticipate cutting your dividends the flamboyant chrysler leader 
said 
iacocca also was in los angeles to concludeda sixcity 
promotional tour linked to an aggressive advertising campaign 
touting chrysler quality he reiterated his claims that the quality 
of chrysler cars now equals japanese models and that they are the 
safest on the road 
now he said the task is convincing americans of that and 
were going to get better 
he said the whole industry has suffered of late chrysler 
included from overcapacity and economic declines at the beginning 
and end of the 1980s 
you might say this is starting to look a lot like the chrysler 
of the 1980s a chrysler in trouble iacocca said 
however he said chrysler today has far less debt more than 10 
times the cash on hand can borrow 26 billion without asking 
washington for help as it did in 1980 and has 133 percent of the 
us car and truck market compared with 103 percent in 1980 
he said that after 44 years in the industry he was convinced it 
would make more sense to report sales results every 10 years rather 
than every 10 days because planning is done that far in advance 
he said he realized of course that shareholders would not 
allow him to do that 
but he said taking the long view is the only way to keep 
your sanity in this business 
he also denied that his latest ad campaign constituted 
japanbashing saying he never said a word against the japanese 
people or the highquality products they produce but only against 
their trade practices and the us government for allowing them 
one thing weve learned is that the competition will not 
necessarily be a fair competition iacocca said

if homer simpson sent underachieving son bart 
out to get a job this summer he might keep the punk out of his 
hair for a couple of months but bart could get an unexpected bill 
from uncle sam 
mowing lawns or peddling papers isnt the cartoon barts idea of 
fun but its a way of life for millions of reallife youngsters 
who try to make some money when school is out 
the earning power of summer jobholders can have an impact on 
family tax returns probably not too much tax experts say 
although mom and pop could face additional irs forms and extra 
confusion 
jobholders over age 14 may have to pay taxes or at least file 
returns depending upon how much money they earn 
the socalled kiddie tax an offspring of the 1986 tax 
reform laws presents a problem for those under 14 that tax is 
applied to unearned or passive income such as dividends or 
interest on savings accounts 
all children pay no taxes on the first 500 of passive earnings 
and the next 500 is taxed at the childs own rate usually 15 
percent but for those under age 14 unearned income over 1000 is 
taxed at the parents top rate usually 28 percent to 33 percent 
the purpose of this rule is to curtail the popular practice of 
shifting income to children and other dependents to reduce taxes 
many young dependents aged 14 or older likely wont have to have 
any state or federal taxes deducted from their paychecks provided 
their total annual earnings remain under the standard deduction of 
3250 experts say they will however have to file returns or be 
included in their parents returns if they have both passive and 
earned income 
for the youngster who starts a summer job and has no passive 
income the operative number is 3250 said frank keith a 
spokesman for the internal revenue service 
even more income could be sheltered for a child if he qualifies 
to take a personal exemption which is 2050 for 1990 but parents 
couldnt also claim the child as a dependent on their return and 
in order to qualify the child must prove he provides more than 
half his total support experts say 
regardless of their earnings youngsters still have to pay the 
765 percent social security tax 
staying below the standard deduction shouldnt be much of a 
problem for most children jobholders someone working 20 hours a 
week at minimum wage during july and august could only expect to 
gross about 685 before theyd have to start worrying about taxes 
they would have to be making around 7 an hour 40 hours a week for 
the entire summer 
its a different story for children under 14 although these 
youngsters are barred from most jobs with a few exception such as 
certain farm work or paper routes the kiddie tax could penalize an 
especially enterprising youth 
vincent vaccaro a tax partner at the accounting firm coopers amp 
lybrand said the standard deduction on earned income could be 
reduced if a child under 14 also has passive income 
he gives the following example a 13yearold old makes 3000 a 
year from a paper route plus has 1000 in unearned income the 
first 500 in unearned income would be exempt from taxes but that 
also would reduce the youngsters standard deduction by the same 
amount to 2750 making him liable for taxes on his earned income 
it can be very cumbersome for families its a clear case of 
overkill said judy walsh director of executive financial 
counseling for the accounting firm deloitte amp touche its a 
complicated system for something very simple like children 
trying to earn money for college 
vaccaro agreed saying the kiddie tax has made it a lot more 
fun for accountants

cos has agreed to acquire the east german cigarette manufacturer 
veb kombinat tabak it was announced thursday terms were not 
disclosed 
the proposed acquisition between veb kombinat tabak and philip 
morris gmbh will allow the new yorkbased food and tobacco giant to 
expand further in eastern europe where trade barriers have been 
broken down recently following the move away from communism 
george knox a spokesman for philip morris in new york said the 
two companies have signed a letter of intent to merge and the deal 
is expected to close at the end of june

cigarettes in east germany annually under the brand names f6 karo 
and juwel he said

proposed takeover was approved by a majority of the dresdenbased 
companys employees

salaries by about 90 a month and apply the more generous west 
german benefits it said 
sales and marketing will be directed by philip morris west 
german headquarters in munich while sales offices will be set up 
in berlin and dresden adn said 
the dresden plant which employs about 1000 workers will 
produce brands made by philip morris gmbh as well as its own 
brands adn said 
adn said experts were studying what investments were needed to 
modernize production in the dresden plant and raise the quality of 
the cigarettes

wearing pastel tennis shirts and moccasins 
without socks john a mulheren jr cuts an odd figure in federal 
court where he is on trial for securities fraud 
during a lull in jury selection mulheren playfully grabbed an 
open microphone and sang when the judge asked prospective jurors 
if a sixweek trial would pose problems mulheren joined a dozen 
who raised hands 
mulherens irreverence in the face of prison is consistent with 
an iconoclastic image earned as one of the most aggressive and 
successful speculators of the 1980s 
the 6foot2 wall streeter trained to ride the luge in the 
winter olympics palled around with bruce springsteen wore chinos 
as a merrill lynch amp co wunderkind once brought a rollerskating 
chimp to work as a gag rode a helicopter to work and executed 
daring trades that awed his peers 
he also is a diagnosed manic depressive who allegedly schemed to 
shoot ivan boesky after learning his former friend sought to 
implicate him in market cheating 
hes a very colorful unusual talented guy somewhere between 
charming and crazy said a wall street executive for whom 
mulheren managed capital in the mid1980s 
mulheren 40 looks like a happy bulldog thats the way friends 
describe him volatile yet gentle known for mood swings incited by 
his medical condition an abrupt hottocold that in some ways 
mirrors wall street itself 
he reaped millions in gambles with other peoples money and his 
own that flouted conventional wisdom he threw lavish parties at 
the rumson nj mansion where he lives with his wife and five 
adopted children 
it came apart in february 1988 when mulheren was arrested toting 
an assault rifle and army fatigues police said he was en route to 
get boesky the speculator who named names for leniency in settling 
insider trading charges 
last june mulheren was charged with manipulating gulf amp western 
inc stock and concealing ownership of large blocks of shares in 
concert with boesky his trial began last week in manhattan federal 
court mulheren faces five years imprisonment and a 250000 fine 
on each of 41 counts 
he had a reputation as a very savvy trader said robert 
seijas a new york stock exchange marketmaker the respect for 
his ability was practically universal whatever else he did that 
was true 
mulheren arrived on wall street in the early 1970s from roanoke 
college in virginia as an assistant trader at ga saxton a 
nowdefunct brokerage he was hired by former treasury secretary 
donald t regan at merrill lynch while in his mid20s and ran the 
risk arbitrage department where traders bet enormous sums on 
potentially hot stocks 
his casual dress rankled superiors particularly as young 
mulheren made a personal fortune and generated 99 million for 
merrill in three years associates say confronted about his 
attire mulheren told executives i can wear a coat and tie or i 
can make money the khakis stayed 
he was 26 and looked upon by don regan as the most valuable 
human asset in that firm its kind of remarkable said mulheren 
acquaintance michael aronstein president of the new york 
investment firm comstock partners 
mulheren later left merrill to open mulheren amp co which 
folded partly because he was a careless manager 
he cant handle the administrative stuff or any of the 
nonsense that goes along aronstein said hes not going to 
score 46 points in the game and then clean up the concession stand 
unfortunately in this business when youre running a business 
somebodys got to clean up 
mulheren later traded stocks for the wall street firm spear 
leeds amp kellogg friends said he left in 1984 to be with his family 
after one of his children nearly drowned in the backyard pool while 
mulheren was preoccupied with a business call 
about six months later mulheren founded jamie securities it 
became one of the most powerful traders in takeover stocks 
in a move typical of his style mulheren would dump stock to 
send it down then repurchase at the lower price friends recall 
complex trading strategies that required vast market knowledge 
he was a guy who would initiate market moves by thundering in 
and thundering out said a top speculator who knew mulheren 
speaking on condition of anonymity he would often fake left and 
move right 
mulherens skill was matched by eccentricity his antics at 
merrill lynch ranged from inviting dixieland bands onto the trading 
floor to renting a live chimp on roller skates named mr zip 
he kept a large portrait of john belushi by his merrill desk a 
large stuffed toy bear sat by his desk at jamie where he also 
installed a nautilus machine hed take breaks to work out 
john is his own person he doesnt make excuses or explain 
himself to anybody said mulheren friend charlie sweeney a 
merrill senior vice president he said mulherens trading ability 
shone through whether he dressed in a blue jumpsuit or a beanie 
with a propeller on top 
mulheren snubbed golf and tennis drawn instead to sports that 
matched his love of risk hoping to qualify for luge racing at the 
1988 olympics in calgary alberta he hired a german trainer 
bought the best gear and zoomed down the ice at lake placid ny 
he wanted to bring the fun back into the olympics he tried to 
bring fun back onto the trading desk on wall street too said 
friend charles minter a partner in comstock partners 
known for generosity mulheren hosted huge parties and 
childrens competitions at his riverfront home he once ordered a 
hail of pingpong balls to fall from the sky he threw a this is 
your life party for wife nancy 
boesky was mulherens achilles heel they were so close boesky 
made him a family trustee when boeskys firm faced a jam in 1982 
mulheren helped bail him out they talked almost daily 
in 1986 mulheren had no hint of boeskys impending fall 
mulheren subsequently cooperated with regulators but became 
increasingly frazzled when it appeared he would be indicted 
in early 1988 mulheren stopped taking lithium prescribed for his 
depression on feb 18 he loaded some of his weapons collection 
into his mercedes his wife called police who stopped him in the 
driveway they said mulheren planned to kill boesky and boeskys 
chief trader michael davidoff 
two months later jamie securities folded because of mulherens 
legal problems weapons charges in new jersey later were dropped 
and mulheren was placed on probation 
he recently returned to wall street as a partner in another 
firm jampb specialists friends praise him for going to trial 
unlike other wall street figures who have copped guilty pleas 
hes got that traders mentality he sees a good trade 
here sweeney said dollars and cents id think hed be 
smarter settling but its not a matter of dollars and cents he 
wants to be completely exonerated 
boesky is the main prosecution witness 
i wish he had never made any contact with ivan boesky 
minter said but you cant go back i just hope the evidence 
presented will exonerate him

the lyndon b johnson space center has poured 
billions of dollars into the houston area since 1962 but its true 
economic value has only recently been recognized and now the 
center is viewed as a key to prosperity 
stripped of 225000 jobs when the energy industry collapsed the 
nations fourth biggest metropolitan area suddenly found itself 
without an economic anchor and sought another what it found in 
part was aerospace most of it connected somehow to the space 
center 25 miles southeast of town 
we frankly have never really focused on it until five or six 
years ago said john brock president of economic development for 
the greater houston partnership 
the space center has pumped almost 40 billion directly into 
houston and even with a reduced space program the center spends 
about 37 million each working day 
the impact might be 10 maybe even 20fold on the general 
economy in houston brock said 
economist robert hodgin of the university of houstonclear lake 
said the space center while an important contributor to the 
regions economy provided only a piece of the recovery 
what it did do however was to serve as ray of optimism 
served as a magnet for other endeavors and served as a pr public 
relations tool for city leaders hodgin said 
the national aeronautics and space administration officially 
opened the facility on 1620 acres of donated land in 1963 as the 
manned spacecraft center directing the gemini apollo skylab 
space shuttle and other programs it was renamed in 1973 to honor 
johnson who as vice president had a lot to do with its location in 
houston 
the space center has served as both an employer of thousands 
there are 3250 federal employees on the payroll plus another 
9650 contractor personnel work at the center or support its 
operations the center also spent 161 million last fiscal year on 
public utilities 
besides the basic operations however brock said the center has 
been a draw to other aerospace companies such as grumman corp and 
mcdonnelldouglas corp both of which have major aerospace 
operations nearby 
grumman came to houston in the early 1970s to build the lunar 
module for the apollo program but in 1986 brought in its civil 
space operations because houston was still in the woes of the oil 
and real estate slump so that made it very very favorable for 
business coming in said grumman spokeswoman miriam reed 
plus theres a terrific local labor force because of nasa 
and the universities there are lots of hightech people there in 
terms of engineering and technical personnel 
the slump nasa and labor benefits helped houston beat out 
metropolitan washington southern california and colorado for the 
facility ms reed said 
grumman had hoped to land the main contract for the freedom 
space station but stayed in houston when it failed and now is a 
subcontractor on the project working on the crew quarters and a 
space tug 
mcdonnelldouglas also set up shop in houston a few years to 
supply parts for the freedom space station 
brock said houston is hoping to land an aircraft maintenance 
base being planned by continental airlines inc 
houston also is home to space services inc which earlier this 
month sent its second commercially launched rocket into space and 
plans to launch 12 more this year ssi is headed by donald k 
deke slayton one of the original seven mercury astronauts 
the fortune 500 20 years from now is going to have a number of 
companies that do business in space said art dula a 
selfdescribed space lawyer who has helped incorporate several 
spacerelated businesses including ssi 
houston since it has a very strong energy industry which is 
hightech and rampd research and development oriented has the 
kind of technical expertise to be home to those companies some 
of which have yet to be founded he said 
while the oil collapse pitched many workers out of a job brock 
and dula said their skills from sheet metal working to computer 
programming easily can be used in the aerospace industry 
and as a result we are trying to take the johnson space 
center and the activities based there and let that whole industry 
blossom he said 
nasa pitched in three years ago as it helped establish a program 
called partners in space to aid companies in learning how to do 
business with the space agency and benefit from its presence 
partners believe that the center must be integrated into 
the business educational research and technology goal of the 
state states a partners publication as such partners work in 
their respective communities to ensure that americas space 
program and especially the portion that could come to texas 
enjoys broad support 
houstons plans could be undermined however by problems with 
texass educational system 
at a recent symposium sponsored by partners in space every 
speaker worried about those shortcomings 
space travel and technology is a highly sophisticated 
business said thomas m stauffer president of the university of 
houstonclear lake it requires indeed demands a significant 
fraction of the nations technical manpower in order for the space 
shuttle to fulfill its mission 
with the upcoming space station project moon and mars 
missions that fraction will grow he said the perfect us 
space program is dependent upon a steady supply of highly educated 
individuals 
but stauffer and others said the texas schools are not producing 
enough of those individuals arguments over courtordered education 
funding show education leadership does not appear to be high on 
the agenda in austin the state capital he said 
while recruiters have focused on aerospace daniel nebrig an 
associate director of the center says future space explorations 
mean more than just a oneindustry impact 
projects such as the space shuttle and the space station require 
specialized knowledge best found at nasa nebrig said 
but to figure out how to live on the moon or mine mars nebrig 
said we need new technology we need people who are used to 
making concrete mining agriculture 
houston plays into that hand very well brock said 
somewhere we will be involved with if not space exploration 
then space engineering as it continues to advance

royal dutchshell group of companies reported 
thursday that net income dropped 40 percent in the first quarter of 
1990 reflecting a weak performance by its chemical group and a 
onetime gain from property sales a year ago 
the anglodutch oil giant based in the hague netherland said 
its net income for the three months ended march 31 totaled 135 
billion compared with 216 billion in 1989 the company does not 
report consolidated pershare earnings 
sales totaled 2912 billion up from 2502 billion 
the companys financial statements are based on british 
accounting methods and cannot be directly compared to those of most 
american companies inventories are valued on the basis of first in 
first out fifo or on a historic cost basis instead of the 
typical american system of last in first out lifo or on a 
current cost basis 
shell said higher crude oil prices increased oil production and 
improved gas sales bolstered exploration and production earnings 
but it also noted that net income for 1989 was buoyed by a 
4124 million gain from property sales 
shell said its chemicals business was weak during the latest 
first quarter mainly from sharply lower prices for commodity 
petrochemicals refining and marketing profits also declined 
with us operations showing a slight loss for the quarter it said 
in the united states chemicals sales declined and several 
plants were damaged by extremely cold weather shell said 
demand for chemicals remains strong and plant capacity 
utilization high although petrochemical margins are likely to 
continue to be well down from the high levels experienced in late 
1988 and early 1989 the company said 
shell also said it had higher tax and interest charges as well 
as adverse currency movement during the first quarter of 1990

saatchi and saatchi the troubled british 
advertising giant said thursday that eight account directors at

saatchi advertising ltd was unrelated to a recent management 
shakeup and decline in the parents financial performance a 
spokesman for the company said

agency and dismissed suggestions it represented a major defection 
its part and parcel of having a people business he said

percent drop in pretax profit to 613 million pounds or about 
1036 million from 1170 million pounds or 1978 million in

platinum futures prices rose sharply thursday amid reports of 
increased racial violence in south africa the worlds largest 
platinumproducing country 
on other commodity markets gold and silver futures also 
advanced copper futures were mixed pork futures rose to the daily 
limit for the second straight day soybeans rebounded from recent 
losses and energy futures were mixed 
platinum futures settled 530 to 540 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in july at 
49290 a troy ounce 
the rally was based largely on news that south africas bigest 
mining company shut part of a gold mine thursday following a racial 
clash that left two whites dead and several blacks injured 
the victims were among 12 people killed in five separate 
incidents wednesday in south africa which last year produced about 
77 percent of the platinum supplied to nonsocialist countries 
the miningrelated violence occurred at an angloamerican corp 
gold mine not a platinum mine but because south africa plays a 
key role in the delicately balanced platinum market any sign of 
escalating racial tension makes traders nervous 
if the situation in south africa were to reach dangerous 
levels where they would have to close a few of those platinum 
mines you could see a strong rally develop said petr cardillo 
a commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co in new york 
analyst bette ratopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
said the platinum market has been trying to rally lately but has 
been reigned in by indications of gold selling by the soviet union

but she said there were no signs of soviet gold sales thursday 
leaving platinum free to respond to its own fundamentals

commodity exchange with june at 37060 a troy ounce silver was

despite the threat of another strike next week at three southern 
peru copper co mines where workers returned to work just two weeks 
ago after a sevenweek walkout 
analysts said traders were focusing on the sluggish us economy 
and expectations of a corresponding decline in copper consumption 
copper futures ended 50 cent lower to 50 cent higher with may 
at 1212 a pound 
porkbelly futures rose the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a 
pound on the chicago mercantile exchange for the second straight

cattle futures settled narrowly mixed in chicago ahead of the 
agriculture departments monthly cattleonfeed report covering the 
seven largest cattle states

of may 1 than traders had expected mainly due to an unexpectedly 
small number of feedlot placements last month

with june at 7420 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent lower 
to 07 cent higher with may at 8482 cents a pound hog futures

a group representing the three networks has 
asked the nielsen ratings company to consider studying new ways of 
counting viewers a proposal that could change the industrys 
standard people meter system the company said thursday 
the request disclosed by nielsen media research came from the 
committee on national television audience measurement contam 
representing cbs nbc abc and the national association of 
broadcasters 
the research company said it would consider the request if a 
decision is made to proceed with a study test results would not be 
available before the end of this year at the earliest 
nielsen also said its regular national service which is based 
on peoplemeter data will remain in place at least through the 
199091 season 
abc cbs and nbc annually pay nielsen a total of 20 million for 
its research data according to a network official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
contams request comes at a time the networks are sharply 
questioning data from nielsens peoplemeter system which is in 
4000 homes 
among other things the data for the first three months of this 
year showed daytime viewing levels had taken their sharpest dive 
55 percent in recent memory 
in a may 3 meeting here with about 300 network and advertising 
exectives nielsen officials said they had found no flaws in 
nielsens ratings system but that they were studying it and 
willing to work with the industry to improve it 
the peoplemeter devices require participating viewers to log on 
when they watch tv thus telling nielsen who is watching tv as well 
as how many 
the system now under fire by the networks became the industry 
standard in 1987 replacing passive devices called audimeters that 
only recorded tv set use and gave raw numbers but not instant 
demographic information 
the people meter is supposed to do both and obviously cant 
do both said nicholas schiavone an nbc vice president for 
marketing and sales research who is president of contam 
uncertainty over the data could have an impact next month when 
advertisers begin their socalled upfront buying of commercial 
network time which this year is estimated to be worth 9 billion 
to 10 billion 
the next step apparently is up to schiavones group jo laverde 
a nielsen spokeswoman said the company still was waiting for a 
concrete proposal for a study from contam 
proposals outlining the scope of the study then will have to be 
exchanged and an agreement reached because a proposal will not a 
test make she said

chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca urged shareholders thursday to hang on despite falling 
profits and a slumping stock price saying things will look better 
by the time its viper sports car goes into production in late 1992 
at the companys annual meeting iacocca acknowledged that last 
years earnings were disappointing and sales have been slow but he 
counseled shareholders to take a long view saying chrysler has 
prepared for strong performance in the 1990s 
nobody in this room is more frustrated than i am at our stock 
sitting there at about 17 a share today iacocca said hell 
that means the stock is less than half the book value of the 
company and its half a billion less than the cash we have in the 
bank 
but he said that despite recent woes the company is far better 
off than a decade ago when it survived only because the government 
cosigned its loans and he said that anyone who bought chrysler 
shares then would have earned a fine return 
if youd rushed out after our shareholders meeting 10 years 
ago and bought 1000 worth of chrysler stock and reinvested all 
the dividends it would be worth 9500 as youre sitting here 
today so yeah im not too happy about that stock price right now 
but take the long view for a minute 
he also pledged to continue a yearly dividend of 120 per share 
barring a disaster 
he said a series of plant closures were regrettable but 
unavoidable given us carbuilding overcapacity and he described 
a 156 billion fiveyear product development plan and 1 billion 
research and development center as untouchable 
on friday iacocca is scheduled to reveal details of the 
companys planned 10cylinder viper which will compete with the 
chevrolet corvette the news conference will cap a sixcity tour 
promoting an ad campaign that claims the quality of chrysler cars 
now equals japanese models and that they are the safest on the road 
briefly answering a few questions after the meeting he said 
i think weve got a good program well come back in the next six 
months 
asked if it is appropriate to introduce an expensive 
limitedappeal car like the viper at a time when car sales and 
profits are falling he implied things would be better when it is 
introduced for the 1992 model year 
its going to take a year and a half yet iacocca said 
chrysler also is working on a new line of sleek midsize cars 
and an additional model for its profitable jeep line among other 
vehicles 
compared to 1980 chrysler today has only onetenth the debt 
ratio 43 billion in the bank versus 300 million a 26 billion 
credit line not dependent on washington a profitable credit 
division and a car market share about 3 percentage points higher 
at 13 percent he said 
he denied that his latest ad campaign constituted japanbashing 
saying he never said a word against the japanese people or the 
highquality products they produce but only against their trade 
practices and the us government for allowing them 
one thing weve learned is that the competition will not 
necessarily be a fair competition iacocca said 
questioned by shareholders iacocca acknowledged that service at 
dealerships could be improved and that top chrysler management 
could benefit from more direct contact with people who buy and 
build the vehicles 
he also said hes hopeful that the us auto industry will be 
able to wean itself from heavy rebates with the accompanying 
artificially high sticker prices although he wouldnt predict when 
that would happen 
id like to do away with them iacocca said were all 
sort of on dope we got onto it 10 years ago and now we cant get 
off it

four major banks accused american telephone amp 
telegraph co on thursday of violating federal telephone and 
banking regulations with its new visa and mastercard credit card 
the banks in a filing with the federal communications 
commission and other regulatory agencies said that by offering 10 
percent longdistance discounts to holders of its atampt universal 
card the telephone giant was illegally discriminating against 
other atampt customers 
the discount was provided simply to promote atampts entrance 
into the general purpose consumer credit card market the banks 
told the fcc 
atampt said the allegations of illegal behavior were absolutely 
without merit 
the fcc filing cited published reports estimating that atampt 
could have 5 million customers for its credit card by the end of 
this year 
credit card industry officials have said that consumers loaded 
down with bulging wallets full of plastic probably would find a 
combined credit card attractive and put big pressure on 
traditional bank cards 
the banks bankamerica corp chase manhattan corp citicorp 
and mbna america bank also made filings with the federal deposit 
insurance corp and the federal reserve said doug jones the 
fdics deputy general counsel 
theyre alleging banking violations jones said he didnt 
elaborate 
fdic spokesman david barr said the banks had sent a 53page 
petition to the agency on tuesday with a 10page cover letter to 
fdic chairman l william seidman atampt spokesman jim mcgann said 
the banks also filed a complaint with the georgia state banking 
commission 
the banks said atampt was charging discriminatory phone rates had 
failed to have the 10 percent discount approved failed to file 
tariffs for finance charges and late charges imposed on the card 
users and discriminated against other credit card holders in 
access to phone service 
peter gallagher senior vice president for corporate and 
consumer affairs at atampt universal card services corp said atampt 
was not violating telephone rules the card is issued through 
universal bank in georgia 
im absolutely confident we are in total compliance with the 
appropriate laws rules and regulations gallagher said 
he also rejected the banks assertion that universal bank was 
acting as a reseller of phone services which also would fall under 
fcc regulation and that the universal card discriminated against 
nonatampt credit card holders who try to use atampt coinless pay 
phones 
we are not going to be deterred by any diversionary tactics 
gallagher said were committed to the credit card business 
were here to stay 
he declined to disclose how many people had signed up for the 
card but said the response has been wonderful

pacificorp on thursday increased its bid for 
pinnacle west capital corp to 182 billion the fourth offer in 
six months by the portland orebased utility giant for arizonas 
largest power company or its parent 
david f bolender president of pacificorps electric 
operations said it would be the last offer pressed by reporters 
at a news conference here bolender added that the bid would be 
withdrawn if there was no progress within a few weeks 
pinnacle west which went from the robust holding company for 
arizona public service co to the brink of reorganization after 
buying merabank in 1984 will hold its annual meeting wednesday 
last month some stockholders of pinnacle west urged management 
including new chairman richard snell to accept pacificorps next 
offer 
pinnacle west spokesman steve carr said the companys directors 
would seriously consider the takeover package 
under the offer pinnacle west shareholders would receive 21 in 
cash for each share of stock 
wall street cheered the offer pinnacle west shares jumped 
362 to close at 1637 in new york stock exchange trading 
kathleen a lally an analyst with county natwest securities in 
new york called the offer very attractive and said that if 
pinnacle west ignored it the company could face lawsuits by angry 
shareholders 
in november pacificorp offered 17 billion for arizona public 
service pinnacle west then controlled by chairman keith turley 
rejected that bid in december it rejected another offer this 
time for all of pinnacle west and its subsidiaries but merabank 
which lost more than 400 million in the last two years 
in early march pinnacle west rejected a third offer that its 
directors said was equivalent to 16 per share that offer was for 
a commonstock swap valued at 17 billion and an exchange of 
arizona public service preferred stock worth 372 million plus 
assumption of debt 
federal regulators took control of merabank jan 31 but the 
holding company was forced to borrow 450 million to bring the 
failed thrift up to capital requirements increasing its debt to 
11 billion 
pinnacle west which has suspended its dividends made 42 
million in 1988 and reported a 5514 million loss for 1989 
in its latest offer pacificorp also agreed to assume all debt 
of pinnacle west and arizona public service 
in addition bolender said pacificorp would retain an offer to 
limit arizona public service rate increases to 2 percent per year 
for four years which is less than a 6 percentperyear 
threeyear proposal filed by the utility with state regulators

striking greyhound drivers took their picket 
lines to the companys financial backers thursday and urged them to 
pressure the financially strapped bus line back to the bargaining 
table 
if greyhound goes under they go under ellis b franklin 
vice president of the amalgamated transit uniont said as about 60 
supporters of the 11weekold strike rallied outside the offices of 
painewebber inc 
franklin said the investment bank owns 16 percent of the closely 
held bus companys parent firm 
similar rallies were held outside brokerages and other financial 
institutions in seven other cities 
a call to painewebber was not immediately returned 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said he expected the rallies 
to have no effect on lenders 
companies that put up millions of dollars are not going to 
make decisions based on some rally gravley said 
greyhound is continuing to operate reduced services with about 
3000 strikebreakers the firm lost 56 million in the first three 
months of this year and has missed payments on its debt obligations 
earlier this week standard amp poors a leading credit rating 
agency lowered greyhounds rating to d denoting a default on its 
debt 
in washington strikers chanted contract and negotiate 
now as they walked in a circle on a busy downtown street at 
noontime cheers went up when franklin announced the credit rating 
drop 
gravley dismissed the credit rating drop as a technicality 
the company expected the move after announcing its first quarter 
loss and plans to miss a 975 million interest payment that was 
due on tuesday he said 
for weeks greyhound refused to resume negotiations with the 
union because of dozens of shootings and bomb threats 
when talks finally resumed two weeks ago the union called the 
companys offer an insult last week greyhound chairman fred 
currey claimed victory and dismissed the strike as irrelevant 
regardless of what mr currey says the atu is not going 
anywhere well be here forever franklin told the picket line

american telephone amp telegraph co said 
thursday it planned to lower its interstate and international rates 
by about 160 million annually effective july 1 
in a filing with the federal communications commission atampt 
said it would reduce by 100 million its prices for directdialed 
interstate calls during evening hours that represents a reduction 
of about 25 percent 
an additional 60 million reduction would take place in other 
longdistance and operator services the company added 
but it also plans to eliminate the free call to interstate 
directory service now offered each month the company said its 
research showed that only one in four residential customers uses 
that directory assistance over a threemonth period 
the changes require fcc approval 
the company said that during evening calling hours 5 pm to 11 
pm sunday through friday the price of a 10minute directdialed 
call to anywhere in the continental united states will cost 153 
or less today such a call costs 158 or less 
the decrease is atampts 11th since 1984 following the breakup of 
the old bell system the decrease would bring the companys total 
longdistance reductions to 42 percent during that period 
atampts main competitors mci and us sprint have tended to drop 
their prices in line with atampt 
atampt spokesman jim mcgann said the 60 million portion of the 
reduction was in anticipation of an expected adjustment by the fcc 
in what longdistance carriers pay to connect with local phone 
networks 
much of the post1984 reductions in longdistance rates has been 
because of fccordered reductions in socalled access charges when 
the longdistance carriers paid less they were required to pass 
those savings along to customers 
but in july 1989 the fcc imposed a new regulatory structure 
that caps the prices atampt charges instead of its profits as a 
result atampt doesnt automatically pass through its savings to 
customers 
were not required anymore to directly dollar for dollar 
pass through reductions to us for instance in access mcgann 
said what were required to do is stay below the cap 
in fact last november atampt raised interstate night and weekend 
calling rates by 13 percent a 34 million annual increase 
mcgann said competition and increased productivity was the best 
guarantee of lower prices he said atampts evening prices already 
were below the price caps and the new reduction will drop them 
even farther below

the developing soviet aviation market through a threeway pact with 
the soviet government and a west german engine maker 
although the agreement is short on specifics pratt officials 
said it opens the door to cooperative ventures on small to 
mediumsized commercial aviation engines 
pratt spokeswoman peggy ford said the agreement could involve 
the codevelopment of a new engine soviet participation in 
production of engines made by pratt and motoren und turbinen union 
also will be considered she said 
the cooperation is likely to involve the use of engines with up 
to 40000 pounds of thrust about equal to most recent outgrowths 
of pratts pw2000 series pratt spokesman mark sullivan said 
the engines likely would be used on sovietbuilt airframes 
sullivan said although he said the agreement does not exclude the 
possibility of engines powering westernbuilt aircraft

a new yorkbased investor group seeking 
control of allegheny international inc said thursday it had 
acquired 59 percent of the troubled appliance makers junior debt 
through a public tender offer 
the offer by japonica partners expired wednesday control of the 
debt could put japonica in a strong position to get its 
reorganization proposal approved by creditors of the company which 
sells the sunbeam and oster brands 
a preliminary count showed japonica received tenders for 695 
million of the 1115 million principal value outstanding of three 
series of allegheny international subordinated debt japonica said 
in a statement 
it offered to buy those bonds at prices ranging from 277 cents 
to 41 cents on the dollar 
it also received 6 million out of 173 million principal 
amount of subordinated debt of chemetron corp an allegheny 
international subsidiary by offering 838 cents on the dollar

japonica has claimed that figure is inflated

an undercover fbi agent told jurors thursday he 
traded thousands of commodities contracts for customers while 
secretely recording pit traders conversations during an 
unprecedented sting operation 
fbi agent randall jannett took the witness stand to defend his 
ability to spot illegal trading during a wideranging federal probe 
of corruption at the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago 
board of trade 
fortyseven traders and a clerk in the worlds two largest 
commodity exchanges were indicted last year as a result of the 
investigation prosecutors contend that traders diverted customer 
profits into their own accounts 
sixteen of those charged have pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
and agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors 
jannett specialized in swiss franc futures during 1988 a swiss 
franc future is a contract to buy or sell that currency at a future 
date at a price agreed upon in advance 
jannett and another fbi agent posing as inexperienced 
commodities traders investing family money passed all the tests 
required to trade on the exchange floor they bought seats on the 
exchange and opened their own trading company 
defense attorneys for the first three traders to go to trial 
danny l scheck robert d mosky and david zatz told jurors last 
week that jannett was so confused by the frantic pace of activity 
on the floor that he mistook legal transactions for attempts to 
defraud customers 
jannetts testimony thursday was devoted to establishing his 
credentials as a commodities trader and showing jurors how he hid a 
tape recorder inside his red trading jacket the three traders are 
being tried before us district court judge ann c williams 
the governments case rests partly on those taped conversations 
defense attorneys contend the recordings are incomprehensible 
because of the harried shouting typical of the trading floor 
they also contend that jannett was so inexperienced that he 
mistook traders attempts to verify transactions for schemes to 
steal customers profits 
prosecutors are expected to begin playing hours of recorded 
trading floor action when trial resumes friday
