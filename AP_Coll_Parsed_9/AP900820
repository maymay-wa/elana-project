we have been reluctant to use the term hostage but when 
saddam hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those 
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for 
concessions there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent 
people are called they are in fact hostages 
and i want there to be no misunderstanding i will hold the 
government of iraq responsible for the safety and wellbeing of 
american citizens being held against their will 
on sunday saddam offered to release foreigners if the united 
states withdrew its forces from the persian gulf region and

contra supplier eugene hasenfus and a fellow 
courier killed during a failed mission in nicaragua had no formal 
contract and knew the risks of the covert flight defense attorneys 
said monday during closing arguments 
but lawyers for hasenfus and the family of wallace sawyer jr 
say the men deserve to be taken care of for working on behalf 
of a network approved by the white house to support the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
jury deliberations were scheduled to begin tuesday in the 
fiveweek civil trial which was severely limited after us 
district judge c clyde atkins threw out a major portion of the 
claims last week 
all that remains to consider are some financial issues such as 
whether hasenfus is due back pay and if sawyers family can collect 
death benefits from gen richard secord and miamibased southern 
air transport 
atkins ruled friday that jurors cannot consider damages for 
mental stress suffered by hasenfus or his wife sally after the 
plane was shot down by sandinista troops in october 1986 hasenfus 
of marinette wis was the sole survivor of the crash he was 
detained for three months before being returned to the united 
states 
the judge also removed from the case claims seeking punitive 
damages and allegations the aircraft was unsafe 
thomas spencer an attorney for secord said his client did not 
have the authority to make a contract with hasenfus or sawyer of 
magnolia ark who went by the nickname buzz 
my client didnt contribute to the death of buzz sawyer or the 
harm to gene hasenfus said spencer the white house called him 
and asked to help with the resupply operation 
southern air attorney robert beckman said the carrier was just 
one of several companies involved flights to supply the usbacked 
contra rebels who were fighting the marxist sandinista government 
of nicaragua 
hasenfus could just as well brought suit against the maker of 
the parachute that saved his life he said 
defense attorney brian strange told the jury hasenfus and his 
wife should at least be reimbursed for expenses connected to 
hasenfus legal battle in nicaragua 
they were told their families would be taken care of and then 
the defense comes before you and says not us said strange 
secord helped former national security council aide oliver north 
organize the contra supply network secord was sentenced to two 
years probation after pleading guilty to lying to congress about 
his role in the irancontra affair

a quiet revolution is under way in dozens 
of rural southern counties where people historically unrepresented 
are nurturing a shadow government to help them take the last step 
up from slavery 
this alternative power structure conceived by a descendant of 
slaves and based on thomas jeffersons ideas is called simply 
the assembly 
it has brought millions of dollars worth of new schools miles 
of paved roads and most important to the assembly members who are 
mostly black a voice that can no longer be ignored 
in appomattox county gospel songfests and candy sales helped 
the local assembly raise 65000 purchase six acres and clear the 
land for a community center 
we were always going from one place to another having our 
meetings said milton chambers the 36yearold assembly 
president a foundry worker who lives three miles from the spot 
where the civil war ended 125 years ago 
to have a building to call our own he said members gladly 
sacrificed some contributing hundreds of dollars 
the only way to control our destiny he said is to be 
able to turn on and cut off the lights when we want to 
in a phrase he was stating the goal and purpose of the 40odd 
assemblies in virginia and other southern states organization for 
selfhelp and representation 
ill say it til i die if you give people something youll 
build dependency said don anderson a black former congressional 
committee lawyer who created the assembly system but if you just 
organize the voluntarism theyll do it themselves 
and once its done its like magic 
for 22 years anderson has been trying to work that magic 
through his washington dcbased national association for the 
southern poor 
with a staff of 10 and an annual budget of nearly 500000 
mostly from individual donors and foundations its goal is to 
create assemblies in 258 southern counties with low incomes and 
black populations of about 30 percent to 80 percent 
anderson has written that his aim was to give these people a 
vehicle for solving their problems and for taking the last step up 
from slavery 
most assemblies are in virginia and north carolina but new ones 
are being formed in georgia and south carolina and plans are to 
expand to alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas and tennessee 
to spread his selfhelp concept across the region anderson 
touts assemblies accomplishments to date the paving of 20 miles 
of roads in black areas of washington county nc job training 
for the hardcore unemployed in portsmouth va 25 million in 
water line extensions and home renovations through federal grants 
in jones county nc and many other projects 
the assemblies operate within a very refined structure based 
on jeffersons idea of ward republics anderson explained 
we go into a county and divide it up into manageable groups of 
50 people each the equivalent of jeffersons wards anderson 
said and these are represented in a central decisionmaking body 
called the assembly 
to establish an assembly andersons organizers usually spend 
two months locating community leaders and bringing them together in 
preliminary meetings anderson who attends a final organizational 
gathering said it costs 18000 on average to organize a county 
procedurally the assembly is a very accurate copy of the 
british house of commons said anderson who holds a degree from 
the london school of economics 
at a recent meeting of the assembly of charlotte county va in 
a muggy school auditorium members who were dressed as if for 
church closely followed parliamentary rules calling questions 
printed on an agenda named the order paper rising whenever 
addressing the group and directing all comments to the speaker 
the difference is that at the house of commons they dont serve 
fried chicken and biscuits beforehand 
assembly members must be at least 18 and must be registered 
voters although the groups are nonpartisan voter registration 
often is a firstpriority project 
the relationship between the assembly and local elected 
officials varies 
i see it as a system to assist the government thats in 
place said andrew murray who heads the assembly in caswell 
county nc 
others see it as a watchdog organization the appomattox 
assembly and others have appointed members to monitor county 
supervisor and school board meetings 
in surry county va three assembly members sit on the 
fivemember county board of supervisors 
so all the issues that come up in the assembly are heard by 
members that can actually vote on them said surry assembly 
president thomas hardy who also chairs the county planning 
commission 
surrys assembly founded 21 years ago is the oldest and most 
successful hardy proudly showed off its projects to a reporter 
some came about through grants the group applied for some through 
its pressure on local officials 
a neat 50unit subsidized apartment complex built after the 
assembly decried the fallingdown tinroofed shacks that many 
lived in is to be expanded 
a 1 million medical clinic put up by the assembly with 
foundation grants has visiting specialists and is working to find 
fulltime doctors 
a handsome 540000 recreation center hums with activity a 
summer day camp program for schoolchildren meetings of senior 
citizens civic group gatherings even wedding receptions 
as everyone benefits from the improvements relations between 
the races have improved hardy said a white official sheriff wc 
andrews agreed 
its a lot of times that maybe we dont see eye to eye the 
sheriff said but we get together and try to work things out 
of all the changes the assembly has brought in surry a farming 
county where pork peanuts and pines are grown hardy is proudest 
of the schools 
before the assembly started its work with a housebyhouse voter 
registration drive that made clear the black majority the schools 
were in a desperate condition he said 
at the high school we didnt have a gymnasium we didnt have 
a cafeteria 
after integration was ordered all but nine white students left 
the 1300student district for private schools according to a 1971 
news story only two of the districts 60 teachers were white but 
whites held all but one seat on the school board 
now theres a brand new 1 million elementary school a 4 
million high school surrys per capita student spending is 5633 
nearly the highest in virginia 
and although the assembly sometimes criticizes the black 
superintendent he has been successful in working to bring at 
least 80 percent of the white children back hardy said 
the blackwhite ratio among students is now 73 percent to 27 
percent according to martha rollings assistant to the 
superintendent for instruction in the general population about 
six out of 10 people are black hardy said 
there are 58 black teachers 34 white three blacks and two 
whites sit on the school board 
improvement in standardized test scores has been dramatic for 
example surry eighth graders ranked in the eighth percentile 
nationally in reading in 1979 now theyre at the 49th within 
reach ms rollings said of the national average 50th 
percentile were working on it she added 
anderson knows the statistics and the faces they represent 
you dont have to think of symbolic changes he said you 
can transform a whole community

while politicians loudly ask whos to blame 
for the savings and loan mess regulators and analysts are quietly 
asking a much more urgent question is commercial banking headed 
for disaster too 
the answer is yes said economist r dan brumbaugh of 
stanford university were already there 
he believes that more banks would be declared insolvent and 
the government fund protecting 26 trillion in deposits at 12500 
banks would be broke if regulators stopped using outmoded 
accounting methods to determine when a bank has failed 
no said l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit 
insurance corp which through separate funds guarantees both 
bank and thrift deposits up to 100000 per account 
we will be able to handle any failures we can currently 
foresee he said he vigorously disputes brumbaughs methodology 
and conclusions 
but from another perspective the two sides are not far apart 
they are arguing about how bad the condition of the banking system 
is not whether it is in bad or good shape 
the bank insurance fund is in a very much stressed position 
seidman conceded at a recent senate hearing 
because bank deposits are nearly triple the 930 billion held by 
savings institutions the bank insurance funds health has always 
been potentially even more critical than the condition of the 
nowbankrupt federal savings and loan insurance corp 
the funds were established half a century ago to restore 
confidence in the nations financial system after a wave of bank 
and sampl failures swept the nation during the depression wiping out 
the savings of thousands of americans 
for decades both funds thrived supported by insurance premiums 
paid by member institutions but so many savings and loans failed 
during the 1980s that taxpayers had to rescue the sampl fund at a 
cost now estimated as high as 500 billion over 40 years 2000 
for every man woman and child in the nation 
the bank fund has so far been able to handle bank failures 
though the balance has been dropping for three years now and if it 
falls to zero in the 1990s taxpayers would have to bail out banks 
too 
the bank fund which ended 1987 with 183 billion lost 424 
billion in 1988 when bank failures hit a postdepression high of 
221 that was its first decline ever when another 207 banks failed 
last year it lost an additional 851 million 
failures remain high in 1990 121 through aug 16 and seidman 
has estimated the fund will lose around 2 billion reducing it to 
near 11 billion 
a key ratio measuring the funds health has been deteriorating 
even longer in 1963 the fdic had 150 for every 100 in 
deposits by 1981 that had gradually eroded to 124 as failures 
soared during the 1980s the ratio plummeted after this years 
loss seidman estimates it will be between 50 cents and 60 cents 
last week his board proposed emergency action to battle the 
decline preliminarily endorsing a 62percent increase in the 
insurance premium banks pay it is the maximum increase allowed by 
law 
the move would increase the fdics premium income from 28 
billion in 1990 to 48 billion in 1991 much of the added expense 
will be passed on to depositors through higher fees for checking 
accounts and other services 
analysts however say the added income would provide only a 
little extra protection for taxpayers should soaring oil prices 
trigger a recession and another wave of bank failures 
the wild card right now in all these forecasts is iraq said 
economist robert litan of the brookings institution a 
washingtonbased liberal think tank 
clearly right now the fund is skating on the edge it is 
conceivable that it could get by if the economy escapes a recession 
and if oil prices stabilize in the low to mid20s a barrel he 
said however iraq could change all that 
if the recession was deep bank troubles in the 1990s could 
dwarf those of the 1980s which occurred despite an unprecedented 
eight years of expansion in the national economy 
an additional worry is that bank regulators like sampl regulators 
before them would be tempted to allow insolvent banks to remain 
open then with federal insurance guaranteeing their deposits the 
banks would have every motive to take wild risks if they win they 
avoid bankruptcy if they lose taxpayers pay 
a few analysts like brumbaugh contend that is already 
happening 
the fdics behavior is deja vu all over again and it is 
irresponsible he said 
however others believe that with the lesson of the sampl mess 
still fresh bank regulators would appeal for taxpayer assistance 
much earlier and congress would respond more quickly 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
who made his reputation with early predictions of disaster for the 
savings and loan fund said comparisons between banks and sampls are 
overdone 
banks are fundamentally sounder institutions and 
basically the fdic has not been sweeping the problems under the 
rug to the extent that the thrift regulators were he said 
the root of the sampl crisis was planted when the institutions 
were created they borrowed deposits shortterm and lent the money 
longterm to home buyers when inflation pushed interest rates past 
20 percent they had to pay more interest on their deposits than 
they were earning on their mortgages 
cures applied in the early 80s expansion into new lending 
areas coupled with lax oversight only worsened the problem 
the roots of bankings woes are different but still formidable 
in the 1970s the nations largest banks had lent billions of 
dollars to third world countries who by the 1980s were defaulting 
by the mid80s small farm banks began collapsing along with 
agriculture commodity and farm land prices 
then came the drop in oil prices triggering a collapse in real 
estate values in the southwest now real estate problems have 
spread to the northeast and are threatening the southeast southern 
california and even a few midwestern cities 
longerterm innovations in the financial system are eroding 
banks profitability their best deposit customers have been lured 
to money market mutual funds their largest and most creditworthy 
borrowers raise money by issuing commercial paper a service that 
banks are substantially barred from delivering along with other 
securities underwriting 
banks defenders point out that the industry earned a record 
248 billion in 1988 and a respectable 157 billion in 1989 
critics however say that does little to reduce the potential for 
disaster 
although commercial banks collectively earned 62 billion in 
the first three months of this year 10 percent of them lost money 
and 1058 were considered problem institutions by the fdic 
ten percent can easily send you under deep under litan 
said the 10 percent of the banks that are unprofitable hold 
roughly the same assets that the open but insolvent thrifts held 
in the mid1980s we saw what they could do

arabs at seafront coffee shops have 
stopped talking about soccer and turned their attention to the 
persian gulf crisis and the american role in the middle east 
puffing at water pipes in the cafes of this island state that 
has become a banking and business center arabs from bahrain saudi 
arabia egypt and elsewhere gather to endlessly discuss the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait the american response and where it all will 
lead 
americas image in the arab world is 70 percent bright these 
days merchant abdullah ahmed suggested but this will not 
remain so in the fullness of tie of proisraeli 
america will surface again once the kuwait crisis is over 
listeners in white dishidasha gowns and kaffiyeh headgear nodded 
approvalme the ugly fac 
dont tell me that saudi arabian king fahd brought the 
americans to the persian gulf waters and the sacred land said 
one 
not at all ahmed responded saddam did but in the thick 
fog of arab politics well hear many different versions to the 
same story truth can easily be camouflaged 
lawyer mohammed adel interjected loudly no no no first of 
all lets define the basic elements of our discussion to gain 
clarity and avoid moving i four all supposed warlike scenarios are 
frightening and lots of innocent blood might be shed and someone 
will likely be blamed for this besides if israel gets involved in 
any military action against saddam all his arab adversaries would 
look very very bad and his sins be forgotten 
a number of religious men fingering worry beads shouted 
expressions of disapproval one mosque keeper interjected we go 
by the book of allah and say that fahd is struggling with a clean 
heart while saddam resists with a dirty mind 
the loudspeaker blared an egyptian song about arab unity garage 
owner ali juma had to raise his voice when he said the kuwaitis 
may have have been moneyminded but it is their money anyway and 
no one has any right to blame them for investing it in whatever 
manner they deem best for themselves 
many people in the gulf consider kuwaitis moneyminded and 
they are widely considered clever investors and sharp traders 
abdullah ahmed clapped and the waiter replaced the burned out 
tobacco in his water pipe inhaling smoke he said i believe the 
real crisis is yet to unfold what we see now is merely a spark 
the harm is done regardless of how the crisis will be ended 
the garage man said saddams mistake rests really with the 
enormity of his overblown reaction to kuwaits economic affronts 
instead of pulling kuwaiti ears he punched into their houses raped 
their women deflowered their daughters and looted their jewelry 
and i say the real crisis will unfold when the poor arabs 
begin to demand financial help from the rich arabs said ahmed 
sometimes peacefully and sometimes by force 
and saddam 
one eventuality envisions the iraqi people brightening their 
image and getting rid of saddam said ahmed but he also spoke of 
an alternative that saw an antiiraq economic blockade persisting 
and saddams machinations succeeding in stirring the arab masses 
against one government or another thus giving him a broader 
popularity and support 
another posibility he said was that the americans might 
provoke a fight and usher in the israelis which means saddam would 
die and become an arab martyr 
the lawyer summed it up 
i told you the future is bleak he said there are 
several options the sweetest of which is bitter

following are excerpts of iraqi president 
saddam husseins message sunday to the families of westerners 
stranded in kuwait and iraq his remarks were carried by the 
official iraqi media and translated by the associated press 
ladies and gentlemen dear children 
i know that you are pained because your relatives are not 
allowed to leave iraq i am just as pained as you are i am fully 
convinced that the speaker and members of the iraqi national 
council are also pained and so are all iraqis and arabs 
we are all sorry for what happened it was not of our own 
making but the outcome of the will of certain people who acted 
arbitrarily and deviated from the will and teachings of god the 
responsibility for all this lies directly with us administration 
and the british government 
gentlemen you may not know that this country whose rulers 
concocted plots kuwait was part of iraq until 1913 and that iraq 
did not recognize it until the 1960s that the iraqi prime minister 
issued a decision in 1961 annexing kuwait turning it once again 
into a district linked to albasrah and appointing its sheikh as 
governor as was the case before world war i 
why do the us president and the british prime minister want to 
starve the iraqi people to death cursed be what they are doing 
what have the iraqi people done other than unite themselves and the 
families that were divided by circumstances in iraq and kuwait 
defend themselves and help oust the backward kuwaiti sheikh whose 
only concern was collecting money and women 
why are they imposing a siege on iraq to kill the babies and 
elderly as well as those who cannot get food and medicine why 
are they massing naval fleets squadrons of planes and ground 
forces with which they want to attack iraq 
as it is clear to you our homeland is being threatened by 
america and britain and those frustrated and humiliated ones 
involved with them our people are exposed to a grave danger 
it has been decided that preventing the foreigners from 
traveling outside iraq will open a deep dialogue with the 
peoples of those countries and those who represent them and with 
the administrations of those countries to find a peaceful solution 
and avert a catastrophe in the region and maybe the whole world 
 
the presence of the foreigners with the iraqi families at vital 
targets might prevent an attack 
we are seeking to deter the harm of death murder and 
starvation resulting from the us policy preventing their 
departure is a service to humanity 
i add ladies and gentlemen that many of iraqs children and 
your children will become orphans many of our women and your women 
will be widowed and many of our men and your men will die if war 
breaks out 
to deprive an individual from seeing his homeland for some time 
is better for him and for humanity as a whole than depriving 
thousands of people of life 
let us cooperate to prevent these governments from committing 
major crimes and force them to withdraw their troops from the 
region the presence of which may cause an intentional or 
unintentional spark that will result in an inferno and 
insurmountable flood of fire 
in order to give everybody the opportunity to achieve peace in 
order to disclose and expose those who want war and destruction 
and in order to secure freedom for all we put forward the 
following initiative 
firstly the security council with the consent of the united 
states guarantees that us forces will withdraw from the region 
under a fixed timetable and within a period not exceeding the time 
it took to mobilize them 
in addition the security council reassures saudi arabia that it 
will undertake collective military action against iraq if it 
attacks saudi arabia 
at the same time both iraq and saudi arabia pledge that neither 
of them will commit an act of aggression against the other or harm 
the interests of the other 
secondly the security council guarantees the security and 
stability in the entire region in accordance with the general basis 
contained in our previous initiative this alternative as we 
see it is the option to achieve full and comprehensive peace and 
bring definite stability to the region and the world 
thirdly if either paragraph one or two above is accomplished 
the foreigners shall be allowed to travel immediately as they 
choose 
fourthly if the above is not to be fulfilled for any acceptable 
reason then we will be content with a clear unequivocal written 
commitment from the us president that he withdraw his forces and 
those of his allies in accordance with a specific timetable and 
in a period that does not exceed the time to mobilize these forces 
that he pledges not to use force against iraq that he declares his 
respect for international law and refrain from violating it that 
he breaks the economic blockade on iraq by all sides immediately 
and that he deals with iraq on the basis of mutual respect and 
reciprocal refraining from harming the interests of either party 
for us when the above mentioned items are met we will use our 
constitutional powers to allow the foreigners concerned to travel 
out of iraq each according to his wish and decision 
fifthly the issue of kuwait should be left for the arabs to 
tackle as an arab issue the same way they handled similar issues 
such as that of the sahara in the arab maghreb region between 
morocco and the other parties concerned and the issue of syrias 
occupation of lebanon 
will the deaf hear this is a question directed to the us 
administration a correct answer to this question will serve 
humanity gods peace and blessings be upon you

the us military mindful of the toll taken 
by terrorists the last time american troops were on middle east 
soil is improving the security for its growing force in saudi 
arabia 
already strict security measures have been tightened even more 
in the past 72 hours as saudi officials expressed more concern 
over the possibility of terrorist attacks a subject us military 
officials refuse to discuss except in general terms 
we are doing what we think is necessary to protect our people 
equipment and installations one senior american officer said 
here but im not going to get into whether we feel there is more 
of a threat or less of a threat or things like that 
a saudi government official however said saturday night that 
some concerns had been raised over the possibility that iraqi or 
iraqisponsored terrorists could have slipped into the saudi 
kingdom with kuwaitis fleeing their occupied country 
we essentially have been allowing free crossing of the border 
and maybe at times we should have been more diligent the saudi 
official said 
the official like others quoted here spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
american military officers here have both publicly and 
privately expressed concerns that american military personnel 
might be targeted for terrorist attacks as the stalemate with iraqi 
troops just over the saudi border in kuwait drags on 
american diplomatic posts around the world were urged to take 
security precautions in the days after president bush committed 
us troops to the defense of the saudi kingdom and its oil fields 
when asked about strict security measures here us officials 
repeatedly recall the devastating 1983 truck bombing of a marine 
barracks in lebanon 
this a very dangerous part of the world one us military 
officer involved in security efforts said history would tell us 
to be vigilant 
ground rules for the pentagon pool operation prohibit disclosure 
of specific security steps being taken at us military positions 
in saudi arabia officers also have been urging reporters not to 
disclose such details because of their value to iraq 
visits in the past few days to several installations have 
provided glimpses of security precautions not in place during 
earlier visits 
at one army camp guards kept m16s aimed at a car filled with 
soldiers and journalists waiting outside a command post even after 
the car had passed a series of elaborate security checks 
it might make you nervous but theyre doing their job and 
theyre doing it right the soldier driving the car said 
the possibility of terrorism also is among reasons cited when 
us military officials are asked why american troops are not yet 
allowed to take recreation breaks in saudi cities the saudi army 
on saturday was seen stopping and searching cars on a road not far 
from where some us forces and equipment are deployed 
it is better to take precautions than to suffer casualties 
an adviser to the saudi government said 
not that there havent been security lapses 
the air force included in one package of material it gave 
reporters a handout printed for military personnel that listed 
locations where airmen were staying and the times and pickup points 
of shuttles to base areas several hours later after a reporter 
brought the document to the attention of military escorts 
reporters were asked to return the handout so it would not fall 
into the wrong hands if discarded 
and a navy admiral opened a briefing this week by detailing the 
number and exact location of marines and weapons recently arrived 
in saudi arabia this despite specific written guidelines that such 
details not be discussed 
a television reporter at the briefing instructed his crew not to 
feed that part of the tape back to the united states because it 
could have been broadcast or intercepted during satellite 
transmission 
not surprisingly the marines here appear most on edge about 
potential security lapses 
a shotguntoting marine was standing guard outside one area 
where marines are stationed and refused to open the gate even 
after speaking with two navy officers accompanying a small group of 
reporters 
photographers were clamoring to take a picture of a marine tank 
flying an american flag but the marines refused to allow the shot 
because from the background it might have been possible to pinpoint 
their location 
they will never forget lebanon nor should they one of the 
navy officers said they have every right to be extra sensitive

carol bowyer chose to play the lottery 
instead of eating lunch one day and now her family has two used 
pickups an electric stove and finally running water soon 
theyll have an indoor toilet 
the bowyers won 25000 in the west virginia lottery in june 
and though the money was soon spent life on their mountain in the 
heart of appalachia will never be the same 
its a dream for me mrs bowyer said its something i 
hadnt never really counted on ever its a dream come true 
mrs bowyer 45 her husband walter 46 a coal truck driver 
and three sons live in a fiveroom house they are still building 
outside this mining community lightbulbs are bare and most 
interior walls show bare insulation between the studs it started 
as one room 
the house sits isolated surrounded by sheds for chickens goats 
and tools against dense woods a few miles south of beckley in 
southern west virginia 
i love it up here she said the only objection i ever had 
was water when the kids hauled the water its ok but when 
theyre in school or something and i have to haul water i didnt 
like it 
the bowyers who occasionally had to go on welfare had enough 
money for electricity and a telephone but not for a well which 
costs about 2000 
instead the family hiked several hundred yards with buckets to 
a spring just off a dirt road where they drew water for sponge 
baths they got their cooking and drinking water from service 
stations 
my husband tells me im camping out seven years of camping 
out thats enough for anybody we were planning on moving off 
the lot she said 
then one day in june mrs bowyer walked more than four miles to 
the town of beaver 
i had a choice i either eat or put 2 or 3 in the lottery 
and that day i decided to play the lottery she said 
one of her 1 tickets was a 25000 winner less 5000 withheld 
for federal income tax and 1000 the bowyers owed in back income 
tax 
bowyer bought a 1986 pickup and walter iii 17 bought himself a 
1963 pickup billy 15 and michael 11 received a stereo and a 
remote control car 
then little was left after plumbing supplies clothes a few 
dinners out and a used electric stove mrs bowyer bought from her 
motherinlaw for 50 
so far the bowyers indoor plumbing consists of just a pipe and 
spigot in the eldest sons room soon to be the bathroom a septic 
tank has been installed outside 
we got water in the house so far and thats it weve got 
everything ready to hook up but he cant take off no more work 
mrs bowyer said 
the family moved their mobile home to the mountain in 1983 after 
they couldnt afford to make monthly payments on a lot in beckley 
here they pay 300 a year 
they eventually lost the mobile home too thats when they 
started to build one room at a time 
it was just a piece of land this room here we threw this 
room up and all five of us lived in this room for about six 
months mrs bowyer said as she pointed to her kitchen can you 
picture five people living in one room it was kitchen bedroom and 
everything for a while 
shes proud of their new 105footdeep well 
when he pulled that water out of here it was real pretty and 
clear and i was really happy she said 
this is going to make me stay up here now im not ready to 
leave im happy im content ill stay here until im old and 
they have to roll me off and put me in a home 
she still has dreams 
that money only last me about a week she said ive got 
to win me the big lottery that didnt last long enough

refugees fleeing occupied kuwait say 
resistance fighters are staging desperate and daring attacks 
including suicide bombings and that iraq has been unable to wipe 
them out 
in jordan escaping arabs said kuwaitis opposed to the iraqi 
annexation have been clashing with proiraqi palestinians in 
kuwait one refugee said dozens of people had been killed 
the small oilrich emirate was overrun by the powerful iraqi 
army on aug 2 and annexed six days later most communication with 
the outside world has gradually been cut by the invaders 
refugees arriving sunday at the saudi arabian border crossing of 
khafji said one kuwaiti resistance fighter mounted a suicide car 
bomb attack friday on an iraqi position at a hospital in the kuwait 
city suburb of jabriyeh 
the attack could not be independently confirmed but the 
clandestine kuwait radio also reported it saying an unspecified 
number of iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded 
in an apparent reference to the same incident the kuwaiti 
newspaper alanbaa now publishing in cairo said iraqi soldiers 
had been using the hospital as a headquarters 
a similar attack tuesday destroyed an iraqi checkpoint near the 
entrance to kuwaits harbor the refugees said 
some refugees said they witnessed a brief attack wednesday four 
kuwaiti men armed with rifles fired on an iraqi emplacement at the 
town of jeleeb alshuyoukh nine miles southwest of the capital 
the iraqis conterattacked with machine guns and a tank and the 
four resistance fighters took shelter in a nearby mosque the tank 
fired at least three shells into the mosque killing one of the 
attackers and injuring two the other fled according to the 
refugees 
one iraqi officer was sighted wednesday dangling by the neck 
from a crane in downtown kuwait the refugees said without 
elaborating 
most resistance attacks take place under cover of darkness the 
refugees said none could be independently confirmed 
the guerrillas who call their movement humane resistance 
have also set up an informal organization to handle matters like 
distribution of goods the refugees said 
british journalist victor mallet who was in kuwait at the time 
of the invasion said the resistance quickly developed into a 
guerrilla force mounting ambushes and sniper attacks often with 
weapons taken from police stations 
the kuwaiti armed forces numbering about 20000 were quickly 
overwhelmed by iraqs tankled assault 
mallet who eventuallly escaped across the desert to saudi 
arabia quoted a member of the deposed ruling alsabah family as 
saying that the resistance was developing an underground political 
and military structure and was in contact with the exiled goverment 
abroad 
the plan was to encourage popular defiance and demoralize 
iraqi troops already uncertain about their mission mallet who 
writes for the financial times reported last week from the the 
saudi capital riyadh 
one big problem for the resistance movement has been lack of 
coordination separate groups have formed in various parts of the 
country mallet said 
the resistance groups are also beset by logistical problems and 
lack of weaponry he said 
among the noncombat tasks being carried out by the resistance 
are care of the sick the distribution of food and fuel and 
guarding against profiteers the refugees here said in interviews 
egyptian refugee sameh alminyawi said his wife and daughter 
would travel on to egypt but that he himself would return to 
kuwait and join the resistance because this is my duty to the 
country where i lived and worked seven years 
i dont care what politicians may say or do but these nazis 
should be stopped at any cost he said of the iraqi invaders 
the refugees described streams of iraqis arriving in kuwait by 
car to buy televisions radios and other appliances kuwait is 
facing shortages of milk sugar rice and soap they said 
electric appliances which are scarce in iraq were being sold 
by iraqi troops who looted them from houses the refugees claimed 
they said iraqi officials appeared on kuwaiti television 
thursday with seven prisoners four syrians two egyptians and a 
kuwaiti and announced they would be executed for looting cash and 
gold from shops 
at the ruweishid border post in jordan arabs arriving from 
kuwait described nights shattered by gunfire as kuwaitis opposed to 
the iraqi annexation ought proiraqi palestinians 
kuwaitis are becoming very nervous and violent they shoot and 
kill other arab civilians for no reason said mohammad ahmad 
almaarouf a tunisian merchant 
he was one of thousands of arabs who flooded through the desert 
border post sunday as iraq tightened its grip on westerners in 
kuwait and iraq 
a senior jordanian security official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said iraqi authorities had notified jordans government 
that at least 350000 arabs will be crossing through ruweishid this 
week 
maarouf and other evacuees said the shootouts in kuwait followed 
violent political discussions 
mohammed ali an egyptian said iraqi troops were trying 
desperately to stop the shootouts that have left tens of 
palestinians dead

plo chief yasser arafats support for 
iraq has alienated him from key arab patrons and set off a surge of 
radicalism in his own ranks that he may find hard to control 
by backing iraqi president saddam hussein who invaded kuwait 
aug 2 arafat cut off an important source of revenue the oil 
sheiks of the persian gulf 
he also harmed relations with egyptian president hosni mubarak 
the leading arab moderate who had championed arafats peace 
initiative 
whether these developments will jeopardize his leadership of the 
palestine liberation organization remains to be seen 
arafat has survived many challenges since he took over the 
movement in 1969 but with the plo now threatened with a new schism 
as well as a funding squeeze he is in a tight corner 
in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip palestinians 
cheer saddam not arafat in daily demonstrations against the 
americans and saudis 
arafat faces a growing challenge in the territories where a 
palestinian uprising has raged for 2 years from militants of the 
islamic hamas movement 
hamas wants to escalate the stonethrowing riots against the 
israelis into a fullblown guerrilla war the passions unleashed by 
saddams actions work in their favor 
they see saddams military might and willingness to challenge 
the west and israel as their best hope of liberating the occupied 
lands after decades of despair and humiliation 
in syria the popular front for the liberation of palestine and 
the democratic front for the liberation of palestine have called 
for a resumption of the armed campaign against israel that was 
halted by the peace initiative arafat launched in late 1988 
they are the largest guerrilla factions in the plo after 
arafats fatah group 
in baghdad the palestine liberation front last week called on 
progressive arab forces to confront the invading american 
aggressors 
the group is led by mohammed abbas or abul abbas the 
mastermind of the achille lauro cruise liner hijack in october 
1985 and the failed seaborne attack on israel that led president 
bush earlier this year to break off the us dialogue with the plo 
arab newspapers have reported that terrorist mastermind abu 
nidal plans to base himself in iraq after a split with libya where 
he has had his headquarters for the last few years 
but plo officials interviewed in tunis by telephone said they 
did not believe that saddam would welcome abu nidal who was based 
in baghdad for seven years in the 1970s 
few palestinians were dismayed when saddam invaded kuwait and 
touched off a potentially explosive confrontation with the the 
united states they were increasingly frustrated by the arab 
rulers reluctance to use their oil wealth to force israel to leave 
the occupied territories 
saddam played the palestinian card shrewdly by linking any 
settlement of the persian gulf crisis to an israeli withdrawal from 
the west bank and gaza captured in 1967 
he appealed to the arab masses over the heads of their 
governments for support for his stand against israel and the 
united states 
he has succeeded to a large degree most arabs see washington as 
israels main protector and have long fumed at its failure to 
pressure the jewish state into peace negotiations and a withdrawal 
from the occupied lands 
the plo was reluctant at first to back saddam arafat shuttled 
between arab capitals trying to find an arab solution that 
would prevent foreign intervention but he found the leaders far 
too divided to cooperate said a plo official who accompanied him 
in recent days plo officials have been trying to put a better 
public face on their position 
the plo will never condone the occupation of any country by 
force when we ourselves are victims of such policies said salah 
khalaf arafats senior aide who uses the nom de guerre of abu iyad 
but in an interview he stressed palestinian resentment at us 
failure to force israel to surrender the occupied territories after 
more than two decades by contrast he said when iraq seized 
kuwait and the oil flow to the west was threatened the united 
states and its allies acted like lightning

tonislav maricic and his ethnic 
croatian neighbors in this hillside village say they feel like 
victims of a campaign for a greater serbia 
while their serbian neighbors were voting sunday on regional 
autonomy in knin a city of 11000 people a few miles down the 
hill maricic and friends gathered over coffee and fiery brandy to 
ponder their fate 
were pawns in a political game organized by serbian 
communist president slobodan milosevic with the aim of creating a 
greater serbia said maricic 63 a powerfully built retiree 
while maricic and his neighbors are among the majority in the 
western yugoslav republic of croatia they are the minority in the 
serbiandominated southwest 
the peace among residents of this croatian village and the 
surrounding serbian villages has not yet been disturbed by the 
serbian drive for autonomy 
but signs of tension are evident near potkonje this village of 
60 brick homes scattered around a dirt trail built into rocky hills 
near the adriatic coast 
one of potkonjes handful of ethnic serbs has taken to 
irritating his neighbors by racing through the village with a 
serbian flag in the back window of his pickup truck 
armed men from other villages around knin blocked roads to 
prevent police from trying to stop the referendum 
but maricic local head of croatias new centerright croatian 
democratic union said it is vital for croatian president franjo 
tudjman to maintain a moderate policy toward the serbian minority 
the important thing is for tudjman to keep a cool head and not 
give in to provocations he said 
the serbs should be allowed to vent their frustrations he 
added its better to let wine run out of a cask than to let it 
explode 
he charged serb extremists want bloodshed that could result in a 
call for the serbdominated army to come in and restore order 
potkonje residents oppose the serbian demand for autonomy and 
say if it succeeds they will seek to join a nearby croatian county 
they said their area even though it is dominated now by serbs 
is traditionally croatian and that croatian king zvonimir was 
crowned nearby nine centuries ago 
though residents of the village do not expect trouble with their 
serbian neighbors they have started to take precautions forming a 
village guard armed with handguns 
nikola pozar a 66yearold former railroad worker said they 
hemmed us in but were not afraid because we havent done 
anything but if they attack we will defend our homes with 
axes and pitchforks

carrying a bicycle and a lantern he 
had looted from the burning migrant worker hostel the xhosa man 
smiled as he walked back to his ramshackle squatter camp 
a few dozen of his comrades casually climbed through windows of 
the barrackslike hostel looking for anything of value abandoned 
by zulus who fled savage tribal fighting 
a week earlier thousands of zulus had filled the concrete and 
sheetmetal hostel separated by a narrow dirt road from the 
squatter camp populated mostly by xhosas 
a 24yearold xhosa man called bennett used a large hammer to 
smash a wall block by block he said he would tear down the entire 
hostel which spread over several acres 
he and his fellow xhosas said they wanted to prevent the zulus 
their longtime foes from ever returning 
we cannot go on like this said theo a xhosa who gave his 
age as 30 they took us from the taxis and killed us we cannot 
stand the pressure 
police with tear gas guns occasionally rode by in armored 
vehicles the blacks scampered to their shacks then returned when 
the police were gone 
the zulus and squatter camp residents began fighting on aug 12 
the clashes sparked a week of violence in tokoza east of 
johannesburg and other nearby black townships the death toll was 
more than 290 
the fighting mostly between war bands armed with crude spears 
machetes and clubs had political roots but appeared to have turned 
into tribal war 
most zulus support the conservative inkatha movement while most 
xhosas are loyal to the african national congress inkatha and the 
anc are the major black opposition groups opposed to the whiteled 
government 
theo an anc supporter said politics fueled the violence he 
blamed inkatha for trying to make it appear tribalbased 
to make it confusing they say theyre attacking xhosas 
theo said holding a short iron bar in his hand it started 
sunday when they killed a xhosa 
the zulus then attacked the squatter camp on monday he said 
they were trying several times to move us but they couldnt make 
it 
the zulus left wednesday for another hostel up the road he said 
at times zulus would stop taxis that transport blacks from the 
townships to and from their jobs in johannesburg theo said 
pointing at his elbow he said the zulus would ask riders what it 
was 
if the rider gave the zulu word for elbow he was safe theo 
said but if he gave the xhosa word he was pulled out and killed 
bennett tall and thin with large eyes said he fought the zulus 
on monday night armed with a panga or machete he had rough 
scratches on the side of his throat 
they tried to grab him theo said putting his hand around 
the younger mans neck he escaped 
behind him people carried blankets mattresses and chairs from 
the zulu hostel across the windswept brown clearing to their 
shacks one man had a stereo speaker but the squatter camp has no 
electricity

said the visitors come here and see part of a kangaroo and want 
to take it home with them i think theres a huge market for the 
heads out there 
krueger has been stuffing kangaroo heads for 26 years mostly 
for the market around townsville until about six years ago a few 
were sold in other areas but protests by animal activists halted 
the practice

parents be warned the government has been 
frustrated again in its lengthy fight to help you keep 
dialaporn messages away from innocent young ears 
in a continuing battle pitting free speech against the 
governments right to protect kids courts in new york and san 
francisco last week temporarily stayed federal enforcement of new 
rules designed to make sure the 2 billion marketplace for phone 
sex remains an adultsonly business 
testimony in the new york court had described some of the 
messages as recreations of masturbation simulated rape 
sadomasochism and group sex homosexual rights groups had said 
such services were a form of safe sex in this era of the aids 
epidemic 
kendall morrison the owner of dial information services and one 
of the plaintiffs in the new york case told the new york times 
that his company received 60000 calls a day costing the callers 
1 on average 
until the courts decide on the constitutionality of the 1989 law 
that mandated the most recent federal communications commission 
rules enterprising kids still will be able to shock mom and dad 
with a mysterious charge on the family phone bill 
parents have our full support and our full sympathy fcc 
deputy general counsel renee licht said in an interview last week 
we are doing everything we possibly can to protect your children 
against indecent messages 
but she added there isnt very much we can do until we have 
a final disposition of the court challenges 
parents still can ask phone companies to block access to phone 
sex services where technically possible but the new york judge 
who stayed fcc enforcement of the new rules said only 4 percent of 
new yorks 46 million households had asked the phone company for 
blocking 
congress and the fcc since 1983 have been trying to erect 
technological barriers to indecent forpay phone material 
obscene material of a prurient sexual nature and without 
redeeming value is banned outright on commercial phone radio and 
television services 
but the courts have held that adults have a right to hear 
indecency which the fcc defines as patently offensive 
depictions or descriptions of sexual material 
the courts also have said the government has a compelling public 
interest in keeping indecent material away from children the big 
problem is how to do that without trampling on the free speech 
rights of phone sex providers and the adults who want to call 
them 
in 1987 following two previous court defeats the fcc 
implemented new rules that said phone sex providers would have a 
defense from prosecution for providing indecent material if they 
did one of the following required upfront credit card payment 
scrambled their messages or used access codes the companies also 
were required to ask phone companies to identify the charges on 
customers phone bills 
those rules were in effect for a short period until congress 
fearing that enterprising youths still could gain access to 
telephone sex messages banned such services outright in april 1988 
but the supreme court rejected the ban saying only obscene 
material could be banned 
congress tried again in november 1989 a few months after the 
fcc fined a california company 600000 for transmitting obscene 
phone messages the mother of a 16yearold boy complained that her 
son had placed more than 280 calls to various phone sex services in 
a 2month period in 1987 
the 1989 law reinstated fcc regulation of indecency but under 
the prodding of sen jesse helms rnc congress added a new 
wrinkle phone companies where possible must block access to sex 
message services unless a customer asks in writing to receive them 
dialaporn services immediately labeled the helms amendment a 
type of presubscription that would drive them out of business 
and they sued the government several local bell phone companies 
told the fcc it was not feasible to selectively block adult 
services 
despite these challenges the fcc readopted the 1987 rules and 
the new reverse blocking dictum in june of this year 
the rules had been scheduled to go into effect last wednesday 
but the courts stayed them pending further study 
the new york federal judge robert p patterson said the law 
was vague on what constituted indecency it was not the least 
restrictive means available to accomplish the governments 
purposes and it would allow prior censorship without adequate 
safeguards

the soviet defense ministry recently provided a

we always eat like this insisted 
the crewcut soviet draftee stuffing a hunk of black bread in his

range of this 2nd guards artillery base outside leningrad four

rare tour to four army bases by foreign correspondents but 
soldiers had been busy painting everything else 
organizers obviously took inspiration from a famous russian 
field marshal prince grigory potemkin who had fake villages 
erected overnight to greet catherine the great as she traveled 
through conquered territory 
still it was a remarkable opening by the army which for 
decades considered foreign journalists to be spies most of the 
area surrounding moscow is still forbidden territory for 
nonsoviets because they might glimpse the fence of a military base 
on the tour reporters and television crews were offered a mock 
tankandhelicopter battle a session with soviet grenade launchers 
and the greasy experience of crawling inside an armored personnel 
carrier and peering through tiny slits 
like the us army the soviets have discovered it is far 
cheaper to train on simulators than the real thing the 
filmtrainer for armored personnel carrier drivers captured the 
roaring and sheer difficulty of controlling one of these monsters 
as they lumber offroad 
but the simulator had limitations its dashboard with clunky 
meters and heavy manual buttons looked like it belonged to the 
mid1950s not the age of hightech warfare 
crews for the big guns practiced loading lightweight empty shell 
casings and pulling a string all it lacked for theater was someone 
yelling bang 
draftees stripped to the waist lifted legs and arms in 
calisthenics more reminiscent of jane fonda than us marines but 
their metal weights were not shiny barbells they were wornout 
tank treads 
most young soldiers were tonguetied in the face of foreign 
journalists and highranking officers but their shyness turned to 
rampant curiosity when they learned american recruits earn 670 a 
month to their 7 rubles thats 12 per month at the very best 
exchange rate 
the tour began on the hardly typical prerevolutionary base of 
the 2nd guards nestled among the splendrous gardens of the czarist 
palaces outside leningrad it even had its own church a 
crumbling oniondomed beauty boarded up so long that saplings 
grew from the crenellations 
the soldiers were reluctant to discuss the armys most serious 
problems hazing language difficulties among recruits from asian 
republics who cannot speak russian and a critical shortage of 
housing for soviet troops withdrawing from eastern europe 
journalists hoping to see examples of the housing had to make do 
chatting with officers wives at the malorita base near brest they 
said they had no problems 
while many units returning from eastern europe have nowhere to 
go their husbands paratrooper regiment took over an ss20 missile 
base abandoned by a larger unit under a ussoviet nuclear 
weapons treaty 
we were lucky everybody has a place to live said marina 
petrovna a captains wife soviet journalists goggled at the 
wives whose youthful looks and hungarian fashions contrasted with 
the appearance of the average soviet woman 
the political officers who ran the show borrowed a few tricks 
from intourist the government tourist agency packing the 
schedule with travel and ceremonies that left little time for 
mixing with ordinary people 
as a result the entourage was late for gen boris gromovs news 
conference and wargame show ten minutes into correspondents 
questions the hero of the soviet union and former soviet commander 
in afghanistan was drowned out by his own artillery fire 
political officers looked on indulgently when the 
correspondents many longtime residents who have picked up the 
soviet habit of hoarding cleared out the military shops supply of 
paratrooper tshirts officers caps and army watches the hottest 
item was an army belt leather with a brass hammerandsickle 
buckle for 260

from a helicopter the neat 
patchwork of farms fades quickly to ragged stonefenced cornfields 
and the sierra madre del sur where a cash crop flourishes in the 
craggy wilderness 
pure marijuana all marijuana said jesus verjes a director 
of the annual threemonth government effort to destroy the crop 
the helicopter flew over patch after patch of marijuana in 
southwestern michoacan state 
michoacans border with guerrero is shaggy with wilderness 
creased with cliffs and rimrock there are no roads 
it is only one of many parts of mexico where marijuana grows 
but is popular because of the soil climate and isolation 
marijuana is a richer green than surrounding foliage and a 
trained spotter can pick out the plantios or patches 
those in the open are sprayed from the air if they are 
shielded police are flown in to uproot and burn the plants 
we are doing it now because the marijuana is about half 
grown verjes said it is too young to harvest but too late in 
the year for the growers to get another crop planted we are trying 
to break the growing cycle 
when the marijuana season ends in three months the federal 
judicial police will start their campaign against opium poppies he 
said 
federal police have uprooted or sprayed about 3000 acres of 
plants and confiscated 400 tons of dried marijuana so far this 
year according to government statistics 
how much of the drug will survive the eradication programs and 
get to market is nearly impossible to calculate because no 
consistent figures are available on the amount of marijuana planted 
or harvested each year 
the us national narcotics intelligence consumer committee 
headed by the drug enforcement administration estimates more than 
42000 tons of mexican marijuana finds its way into the united 
states each year or about 79 percent of the countrys total supply 
mexico has 114 planes and helicopters dedicated to drug 
eradication the united states provides about 15 million a year 
for such programs 
in a small glen on a mountainside soldiers uprooted armloads of 
yardhigh plants that had been sheltered by trees and carried them 
to a bonfire 
they used to plant these things in plots bigger than a hectare 
about 2 acres but when we started picking them out from the 
air they got smarter verjes said most plots now are much 
smaller 
he said the plants were criollo or marketgrade which grow 
easily and quickly and are fairly easy to spot from the air 
verjes said the lowbush cola de borrego or sheeps tail 
produces a more potent leaf brings a better price and is easier to 
hide among other vegetation but the yield is lower and it needs 
some special growing conditions 
if we spot an area from the air that has maybe five plots we 
send in police and usually find 15 or 20 other plots hidden away 
nearby he said 
growers have taken to planting corn giving it a start then 
planting marijuana among it giving an appearance from above of an 
innocent cornfield 
if nobody lives nearby or there is a shack that appears 
abandoned police often are sent in for a closer look 
they have gotten smarter but so have we verjes said 
police in helicopters had descended the day before on the camp 
used by workers tending the plants that were being burned the 20 
or so men had escaped quickly abandoning hot food on the fire 
there were seeding beds for starting the plants a drying rack 
and enough rice beans sugar tortilla flour and other supplies to 
last for weeks possibly months 
a pot of beans was on the dead fire of the camp about 140 miles 
southwest of mexico city clothes were scattered among crude bamboo 
beds on a dirt floor 
if the crop had survived verjes said it would have been 
compressed into bricks and taken to a buyer by burro he said bus 
ticket stubs in the shelter indicated most of the workers were not 
from michoacan but had come from other poor agricultural states 
drug camps are heavily armed and 17 federal police assigned to 
drug eradication have been killed so far this year usually at the 
outset of raids 
most of the plants in this plantio had been laid out in neat 
rows perhaps from years of habit making them easier to spot in 
the tangle of trees and bushes 
the patches were scattered over about 40 acres providing about 
five days work for the men uprooting the marijuana said hector 
salinas almaguer a lawyer and police agent who led the detail 
from here they will go down the mountain to some other 
patches we have found from the air he said 
michoacans isolation closed in aside from the fires crackle 
and the tramp of boots the only sounds were crickets mosquitoes 
and the rustling of leaves in a light breeze

defense secretary dick cheney is seeking 
increased international support for the us naval barricade of 
iraqi shipping as one key persian gulf state offers to host 
friendly forces on its territory 
cheney planned to leave this island nation today after 
conferring with its emir sheik isa alkhalifa he was to travel on 
to other friendly arab nations in the persian gulf before returning 
to saudi arabia 
one stop on his itinerary was the united arab emirates which 
announced sunday it has agreed to the deployment of arab and 
friendly forces on its territory to help defend the persian 
gulf region 
diplomatic sources in abu dhabi said the announcement approved 
the deployment of us egyptian and pakistani troops but it was 
not immediately known if any of those nations planned to send 
forces 
the united arab emirates has agreed to receive some arab and 
friendly forces as a contribution to the arab and international 
efforts being exerted to defend the region said the foreign 
ministry statement released by the united arab emirates official 
news agency the statement did not name any countries or say how 
many forces would be involved 
cheney also was scheduled to visit oman today before heading to 
jiddah saudi arabia 
during a stop sunday on the command ship of the us naval task 
force in the persian gulf cheney vowed the united states would 
continue its effort to cripple iraqs international commerce and 
use force if necessary the ship was docked in bahrain 
he spoke as us warships shadowed two iraqi oil tankers after 
the vessels ignored us warning shots saturday and headed out of 
the gulf region 
the shots were the first fired in an interdiction effort ordered 
by president bush to halt goods leaving and entering iraq the 
united nations previously ordered a trade embargo against iraq 
involving all goods except food and medical shipments 
our forces are authorized to intercept shipping that they have 
reason to believe may in fact be violating the sanctions cheney 
told reporters traveling with him 
we want to continue to work both by voluntary means and by 
naval means if necessary to see to it that the sanctions are 
enforced he said 
the iraqi news agency said iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on 
sunday called the us shipping interdiction effort piracy and 
armed aggression and asked the international community to condemn 
it 
cheney would not speculate on any steps that might be taken 
against iraqi tankers if they continued to refuse to stop 
i wouldnt want to speculate on what happens next he said 
we obviously are prepared to see to it that the sanctions that 
the united nations voted and the action that the legitimate 
government of kuwait asked us to take are carried out 
an administration official said the united states intended to go 
forward with its interdiction effort even though no further action 
has been taken against the two iraqi tankers 
theres nothing pushing immediate action here said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity weve stated our 
intent and many people are complying voluntarily 
the official said the administration is looking toward further 
action in the united nations on enforcement of its sanctions 
the un security council unanimously demanded saturday that 
iraq let all foreigners leave and that baghdad take no action to 
jeopardize the safety security or health of such nationals 
cheney refused to tie the outbreak of shooting in the areas 
tense waters to iraqs refusal to allow more than 3000 americans 
and thousands of other westerners to leave that nation or kuwait 
the tiny oilrich kingdom that iraq overran on aug 2 
cheney insisted the two are unrelated 
on sunday cheney was in bahrain and saudi arabia where he 
inspected us troops at a desert air base 
the united states is building forces in saudi arabia to deter an 
iraqi invasion of the united states largest supplier of oil 
should saddam hussein be foolish enough to launch an attack on 
saudi arabia american forces would be able to do a very 
effective job of making him pay us a bit of a price for that 
cheney told reporters at the base 
as us and saudi f15 fighter jets screamed overhead he viewed 
the mass of us military equipment lined along one runway visited 
with members of a sheridan tank unit and was taken to a patriot 
missile battery dug into the desert on the outskirts of the air 
base

with iraqi troops massed 
on the other side of the border in occupied kuwait the traffic is 
only oneway at this giant toll booth in the middle of the desert 
the local branch of the riyadh bank is closed big americanmade 
sedans are parked willynilly and saudi customs agents are 
underemployed these days 
in fact the only people passing through this checkpoint are 
refugees who have fled kuwait 
to them the red cross tents several hundred yards down the road 
and the al khafji hotel six miles away in the small oil town of 
khafji are oases 
were very crowded very crowded said mursi abu bakr whose 
family owns the hotel that fronts on the persian gulf with a view 
of some of the richest oil fields in the world 
abu bakr said kuwaitis desperate to stay near the border 
have filled his hotel since iraqi troops invaded kuwait aug 2 
some refugees like kuwaiti air force capt mohamed alajmi 32 
want to stay near the border so they can keep in contact with their 
families by car phone regular telephone lines have been cut so car 
phones must be used he said 
from his reports alajmi said resistance by kuwaitis to the 
iraqi occupation is intensifying 
refugees arriving sunday at the khafji border crossing said one 
kuwaiti resistance fighter mounted a suicide car bomb attack friday 
on an iraqi position at a hospital in the kuwait city suburb of 
jabriyeh 
the attack could not be independently confirmed but the 
clandestine kuwait radio also reported it saying an unspecified 
number of iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded 
despite its proximity to the border there are few signs that 
people in khafji are worried about an iraqi attack 
iraqi troops have dug in about 25 miles from the border 
according to a saudi official and they are not visible 
khalid alotaishan the governor of the khafji area said saudi 
troops were stationed nearby in the desert but few could be seen 
in the city which resembled a ghost town as people sought relief 
from the intense midday sun 
saudi officials have said their goal is to keep troops out of 
the public eye to allow life to continue as normally as possible 
saudi tank carriers traveled along the paved road to dhahran 
headquarters of the us military operation about 220 miles to the 
south 
handfuls of saudi soldiers prayed alongside the road in 
accordance with moslem ritual as goats and camels wandered nearby 
in the desert 
only one group of american soldiers was spotted during the day 
seven army men sat in a parked station wagon at the border 
checkpoint 
alotaishan 41 who was educated at the university of southern 
california said people are less worried than they were immediately 
after iraqi troops occupied kuwait 
some of the few hundred khafji residents who fled in panic have 
come back because they think the situation has stablized he said 
six saudi tanks were parked in the desert several hundred yards 
from the building where the governor was interviewed 
abu bakr the hotelier agreed people felt safer in part because 
of the presence of us troops and warships 
asked if he was scared he said the first week we were now 
things are getting better and we work the best we can 
scott scheid of newport beach calif said khafji was probably 
not the best place to be 
i dont think you want to be here if something starts up 
said scheid who works for an american oil company near dhahran 
scheids company has evacuated its 19 local employees from 
khafji 
there is a lot of tension in the air said a coworker 
albert skiba of tucson ariz 
the soul of khafji is the arabian oil co which pumps about 
300000 barrels a day and dominates the area with its refinery and 
oil tank facilities the company is 40 percent owned by the 
japanese with the saudis and the kuwaitis sharing the remainder

regardless of the middle easts impact on the 
worlds oil bill commerce secretary robert a mosbacher believes 
us exports will continue to grow and keep the nations economy 
out of recession this year 
but he admitted in an interview that rising oil costs could ruin 
his prediction that the nations merchandise trade deficit will 
come in under 100 billion this year for the first time since 1983 
mosbacher commented in his fifth floor office following his 
departments announcement friday that exports in june reached a 
record 343 billion and helped drive the trade deficit that month 
to just 507 billion 
that was the slimmest imbalance since the deficit dropped to 
396 billion in june 1983 
assuming oil prices decline soon he said were headed at 
close to a 90 billion trade deficit this year it could be 95 
billion under 100 billion is what ive been saying 
that would be more than a onethird cut from the 1987 peak 
deficit of 15212 billion the imbalance has declined each year 
since then falling to 109 billion last year 
so far this year mosbacher said the deficit has tumbled to 
458 billion the lowest sixmonth imbalance since the second half 
of 1983 
but he admitted that continued high oil prices could add to the 
cost of imports which dropped to 3937 billion in june and helped 
narrow the deficit 
if the price of oil doesnt stay up very long well still 
make it he said the price of oil on friday was nearly twice the 
1464 a barrel that it averaged during june 
many analysts have said they believe skyrocketing oil prices 
will add to the cost of imports in the second half of the year 
offsetting the effect of export growth on the deficit 
the secretary contended that the price of oil is not as big 
relatively overseas as it is here and will not substantially cut 
into purchases of us goods 
so i think well continue to have a good market he said 
you know were now in a trade surplus with europe and i think 
well hold that 
the surplus with europe totaled 8062 million in june pushing 
the sixmonth total to 434 billion at the same time the deficit 
with japan as usual the biggest fell from 2442 billion in 
the first half of 1989 to 1959 billion from january through june 
of this year 
weve had some real improvement with japan mosbacher said 
were down from almost 50 billion last year to what looks like 
40 billion this year plus or minus 
the commerce secretary attributed the export progress to the 
decline in the dollar improved quality of us goods and greater 
export expertise 
us goods are a lot cheaper overseas now for these 
customers he said plus our quality keeps improving and our 
knowledge of how to export keeps improving and finally the 
governments working with exporters 
thus far he said the rising exports shows american business 
is competitive around the world it shows american business is 
beginning to realize its a global marketplace with the biggest 
potential area of growth and unsatisfied demand outside the us

the company responsible for the hubble 
space telescopes flawed mirror is building mirrors for another 
nasa observatory a 14 billion instrument that will see 
xrays from the cosmos 
hughes danbury optical systems inc formerly perkinelmer has 
said it is confident it can provide quality mirrors for the 
advanced xray astrophysics facility or axaf 
based on technical considerations theres no reason 
whatsoever that the hubble problems should have anything to do with 
axaf said charles pellerin jr nasa director of astrophysics 
even though the two spacebased telescopes are worlds apart 
scientifically and have different optical systems scientists fear 
the furor on capitol hill over the hubble error may spread to the 
axaf 
the biggest concern is the negative reaction and the resulting 
delay in funding said stephen murray of the harvardsmithsonian 
center for astrophysics a principal investigator for the xray 
telescope 
the 15 billion hubble was released from the shuttle discovery 
in april to study stars almost as old as the universe two months 
later embarrassed nasa officials reported hubbles images were 
blurry and that its use would be limited until spacewalking 
astronauts can install a new camera in 1993 
a spacing error of 13 millimeters has been found in a measuring 
instrument used by perkinelmer to grind the mirrors nasa 
officials said thursday thin washers in the device could have 
caused the error if improperly installed 
hughes danbury is using a different polishing method for the 
xray mirrors because of their cylindrical shape said company 
spokesman tom arconti hubbles mirrors were like saucers and built 
to reflect visible and ultraviolet light 
its a whole different set of challenges arconti said 
the telescope will study sources of cosmic xrays including 
quasars black holes and supernova remnants to help scientists 
learn the size and age of the universe cosmic xrays do not 
penetrate the atmosphere and cant be seen from earth 
the telescope is scheduled for a shuttle ride in 1997 and work 
is on schedule the mirrors are expected to undergo rigorous 
testing at nasa 
still there is no guarantee something wont go wrong said nasa 
project scientist martin weisskopf it has been our experience 
you put something up its a miracle if everything works 
perfectly he said you have to take risks 
more than a third of the 145 million spent so far on axaf has 
gone toward optics said fred wojtalik project manager for hubble 
and axaf nasa is requesting 146 million from congress for the 
upcoming fiscal year 63 million of that for optics 
in another botched project mirrors for a 747 million series of 
weather satellites being built under nasa supervision have been 
found to warp in the temperature extremes of space but agency 
officials said the problem has nothing to do with hubble or axaf 
itt aerospace communications division supplied an inaccurate 
design to mirror maker applied optics corp of sarasota fla said 
itt spokesman donald walters 
former nasa historian alex roland said such problems are 
examples of the space agencys budgetbased decision making 
there are supposed to be quality control safeguards built into 
that system and my suspicion is some of those steps get cut out 
said roland now a history professor at duke university 
nasa has an unrealistic agenda and its cutting corners on 
all its programs the chances of repeating the problems weve had 
with hubble are very high 
axaf will be the third in the great observatories series 
rounding out the planned fleet are the gamma ray observatory and 
the space infrared telescope facility 
the 550 million mirrorless gamma ray observatory is scheduled 
to be deployed from the shuttle atlantis in the spring the 
infrared telescope is still in the early planning stages with 
launch targeted for 1999 or 2000 
it would be terrible if the perceptions of the moment hurt the 
visions of the future said nasa administrator richard truly

cattle producers in australia and the united 
states are headed for a showdown at the old corral over whos going 
to be top gun in the lucrative japanese beef market 
australia traditionally a producer of grassfattened cattle 
has dominated the limited japanese beef market but recent trade 
liberalization has brought greater access and prospects of further 
growth 
the united states with its vast cattle herds and experience in 
producing grainfed cattle also has enjoyed sharp growth in sales 
to japan 
in 1983 for example australia supplied 37505 metric tons of 
beef to japan while us shipments were only 1231 tons by 1986 
when the australian shipments rose to 43987 tons the us beef 
sales increased to 2213 tons 
but the agriculture department says that last year following 
japans beef trade agreement in 1988 australias share was 93693 
tons and the us total was 22807 tons 
meanwhile according to a report by the departments economic 
research service australia has stepped up its own capacity to 
produce grainfed cattle to compete in the emerging japanese demand 
for topquality beef 
at once australia has served notice that it will not be content 
to continue providing japan with lowerquality beef from 
grassfattened cattle while us feedlot operators walk off with 
the more expensive prizes 
the australian cattle feedlot industry for producing 
grainfattened cattle is less than 10 percent the size of the us 
giant but its an important competitor 
it is large enough to have an impact on the grainfed beef 
trade today and a greater impact in the future if present industry 
expansion plans materialize the report said 
australia has all the resources needed to be a strong 
competitor in the grainfed beef market in japan and in other 
countries importing grainfed beef 
the agencys report was written by economists william d gorman 
of new mexico state university las cruces and hiroshi mori of 
senshu university kawasaki japan 
australia began a smallscale feedlot industry in the 1960s but 
the expansion ended in 1974 when cattle prices plummeted and the 
japanese market was closed the report said a number of those 
early feedlots were built with japanese capital 
this early foray into feedlot cattle on a large scale ended 
in disaster not because australia didnt have the cattle feed 
grains and technical knowledge to make it work but because 
australia did not have a market for grainfed cattle the report 
said 
as of early 1990 australian feedlots had a onetime capacity of 
approximately 600000 head and plans call for expanding to at 
least 1 million head by 1992 japanese investment once again is 
part of the scene 
australia produces large quantities of feedquality wheat and 
barley and smaller amounts of sorghum and corn the report said 
and the country has the capacity to boost production if demand 
increases 
one of the factors in lining up the japanese beef trade is an 
unbelievably wide range in the beef quality offered to consumers 
the report said 
at the top of the japanese quality list of beef cattle is waygu 
the domestic beef breed which may be three or four years old at 
the time of slaughter they may have been fed on grain for as long 
as 36 months 
special imported longgrainfed beef is from australian and 
us cattle two to three years old at slaughter these were fed 
grain for 10 to 13 months 
next in line are the us choice and prime grades of beef from 
cattle 1 to 2 years old that have been fed grain for four to eight 
months this is the topoftheline beef most commonly available to 
american consumers 
below these qualities are several grades of australian beef that 
has been produced on grass or grain or combinations thereof 
marbling streaks of fat and related characteristics are very 
important factors in japanese beef quality the report said in 
general the greater the marbling the higher the price 
the report noted that the current japanese system of controlling 
imports through quotas will be eliminated as of april 1 1991 when 
a new tariff system goes into effect 
at that point the current us practice of shipping quality 
beef to japan by air freight a much more expensive method than by 
ocean freight used by australia will run into problems 
the tariff for beef imported by japan will rise next april 1 to 
75 percent from the current 25 percent the tariff is scheduled to 
drop to 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993 
air freight to japan typically ranges from 70 cents to 90 cents 
per pound compared with 17 cents to 20 cents for ocean freight 
it will probably not be financially practical to continue air 
freighting most beef products after the new tariff rates take 
effect the report said hence the us beef packing industry 
must be able to ship fresh chilled beef by ocean freight to remain 
competitive with australia

a year after colombia resurrected extradition 
as a weapon in his countrys fight against drug traffickers the 
south american government has sent 22 people to the united states 
for trial 
although none of them were on the 12 most wanted list most 
who have stood trial have been convicted and sentenced albeit it 
not to particularly long prison terms 
only one has received the maximum 30year prison term allowed by 
the extradition decree issued last august by colombias 
thenpresident virgilio barco 
of the 22 three were convicted of us charges eight pleaded 
guilty and one was acquitted ten still await trial 
it was the aug 18 1989 assassination by traffickers of 
colombian presidential candidate luis carlos galan an outspoken 
foe of the drug trade that spurred barco to crack down on the 
traffickers 
barcos state of siege included resumption of extraditions even 
though the colombian supreme court had tossed out the extradition 
treaty several years earlier as its members faced threats from drug 
traffickers 
john walters chief of staff to us drug control policy 
director william bennett said in a recent interview that the 
extradition policy allowed an opportunity to bring to justice 
people who might not have been brought to justice otherwise given 
the disruption of the judicial system in colombia that had 
occurred as a result of trafficker violence and intimidation 
the medellin drug cartels leaders whose missives to the

heres your chance to be the first person on 
earth to spot the new moon when it makes its appearance tuesday 
night your efforts wont be on a par with the discovery of a new 
planet but it will help science all the same 
scientists know the position of the moon at any given time 
precisely enough to send six spaceships across 250000 miles of 
space and land on the exact lunar spot they chose 
but they cant predict the exact time or geographic location at 
which the young crescent moon will first be spotted and thats 
where you come in 
the us naval observatory asks participants in the moonwatch to 
be outside where theres a clear flat western horizon and to watch 
from about a half hour to an hour after sunset 
please do not use binoculars or telescope the observatory 
says a good horizon is essential since the moon will be best 
visible when it is roughly 2 degrees to 5 degrees above the true 
horizon 
astronomers will compare the moonwatch observations with their 
theoretical calculations to improve their ability to predict the 
time and location when the moon first becomes visible 
write to the observatory at 34th and massachusetts ave nw 
washington dc 20392 about what you saw and when you saw it a 
sketch showing the position of the crescent with respect to the 
horizon will be welcome the observatory says 
the naval observatory had a moonwatch in 1988 and got 
information from more than 2000 observers ranging in age from 4 
to 92 years some groups turned the occasion into family outings 
their findings were published in the magazine sky and telescope 
be warned the new moon usually does not appear until the second 
evening but it can be visible under certain conditions 
there are no prizes but poets through the ages have praised the 
benefits of being showered by moonbeams 
the moon is nothing but a circumambulatory aphrodisiac 
divinely subsidized to provoke the world into a rising birthrate 
wrote christopher fry 
the naval observatory didnt wax that poetic it offered only 
this hope may your sky be clear

this resort town nestled between pine forests 
and the st lawrence river has been turned into an armed camp and 
it may take a long time for the wounds to heal from the standoff 
between mohawks and police 
the lives of almost everyone here have been changed by the july 
11 shootout between mohawks from the adjacent kanesatake reserve 
and provincial police who stormed barricades set up by the indians 
one policeman was killed although it is unclear which side 
fired the fatal shot 
the mohawks were protesting the villages plan to expand its 
ninehole golf course onto land the indians claim contains a sacred 
burial ground 
villagers saw their peaceful existence explode that day 
property values have plummeted incomes have dropped and trust 
between mohawks and the mostly french canadian local residents has 
evaporated 
now this community of 1800 a summer tourist resort and 
retirement home for many in the montreal area has been turned 
into a police camp 
twothirds of the people have fled their homes either living 
with relatives or in hotels in the region while awaiting the 
outcome of negotiations between the mohawks and federal and 
provincial officials 
i think there will be longterm psychological effects 
said louis bricault a psychologist hired by the municipality to 
help residents deal with their problems 
they are suffering from feelings of anxiety unhappiness 
hostility impotence and defeat there are some people for whom 
these reactions have become very intense 
even when the crisis is over it is unlikely life can ever be 
the same 
we have to find a way to live together said yvan patry 
mayor of oka parish the larger community that surrounds both oka 
village and the kanesatake reserve 
patry said the problem must be solved because the mohawks are 
not going to leave oka and neither are the nonindians 
my greatest wish is that it returns to the way it was before 
we were here together before well be here together afterward 
the economic losses have yet to be calculated there are small 
businessmen like variety store owner r lauzon who will be stuck 
with his summer stock laid in for the usual influx of tourists 
he looked at a rack full of unsold fishing poles im friends 
with everybody but im still losing onethird of my business 
there are others who are worse off some with 5075 percent 
losses 
one of those is michel beaulnes proprietor of the highly rated 
clementine restaurant which has shut down completely the troubles 
drove away his upscale montreal clientele who once flocked to the 
riverfront restaurant for stuffed rabbit back sweetbreads in port 
sauce or pheasant breast with black current sauce 
oka feels like a ghost town not deserted but too quiet with 
negotiations in progress between the mohawks and the provincial and 
federal governments an uneasy calm has returned 
on the barricades an old man and two young cohorts sat in a 
pickup truck guarding the hilltop mohawk barrier the 
militarytype bunkers to the side appeared unmanned 
below only three squad cars were at the police barricade but 
police are omnipresent everywhere else every third vehicle is a 
police car snack bars are full of uniformed men gnawing on hot 
dogs and the cheesefrench fries concoction known as poutine 
patry blames the problems here on a combination of kanasatake 
mohawks who are unable to solve their leadership problems and the 
federal government whose attempts at negotiation have been less 
than serious 
the golf course problem is solved the federal government 
announced it would buy the land and turn it over to the indians 
but the matter of indian land claims goes far beyond oka 
are we trying to solve the problems of alberta and manitoba 
here patry asked its sad it all had to happen here in this 
peaceful little town 
people are angry at the mohawks but its not the mohawks 
its the warriors said resident isidore arsonault referring to 
the militant warrior society 
arsonault however said he was hopeful that in one week it 
will be over 
minutes after he made his prediction a car with two indians in 
it approached the barricade 
go back where you belong shouted one angry man thumping on 
the hood and waving his halfempty beer bottle do you speak 
french you dont even speak french get out of here 
he did not find much support among 100 people at the scene but 
neither did he receive condemnation

defense secretary dick cheney was flown from the carrier 
eisenhower in the red sea to the destroyer uss scott which had 
just come off interdiction duty near the mouth of the gulf of 
aqaba he was ushered into the woodpaneled stateroom that usually 
serves as the commanding officers suite but had been transformed 
into the ships war room 
the officers papered the wall with shipping charts of the red 
sea and persian gulf filling the maps waterways with small slips 
of paper indicating us warships positions 
us ground troops were marked with red dots the northeastern 
region of saudi arabia a possible iraqi invasion route into the 
saudi oil fields had been transformed into a nearsolid glob of 
red 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
below decks on the uss scott the defense secretary made a point 
of spending some time with the cooks machine toolers and engineers 
who made the ship both a home and a finely tuned war machine 
as the secretary walked through the narrow corridors a few 
adventurous sailors came forward and asked that their pictures be 
taken with them cheney wearing a navy blue uss scott cap eagerly 
complied over and over 
one sailor had a particular mission because he and the defense 
secretary had names that are pronounced alike even though they are 
spelled differently 
cheney chatted with the food service worker for a time shook 
his hand and then autographed a photo of the ship asked what the 
secretary scribbled the seaman broke out in a big smile and 
replied he wrote good luck and boy thats the right thing 
to wish us now

the scotts captain cmdr tom corcoran said the first alert 
for the vessel to get from the mediterranean to the red sea led to 
a frenzy of activity of loading supplies and fuel on his guided 
missile destroyer and transferring missiles at sea from the 
eisenhower 
other officers on board the ship reported that corcoran remained 
at his post on the bridge guiding the rush of activity for 18 hours 
straight 
weve had the most incredible ten days of my life the 
commander said everyones responded and nobodys tired 
upon hearing that a lieutenant and several sailors standing 
behind the commander broke out in loud guffaws and corcoran 
sheepishly joined in

the men of the eisenhower battle group had begun to think theyd 
be home soon since their six months at sea were nearly up theyd 
even begun writing letters to their wives and families that theyd 
be back in their home port of norfolk va in early september but 
as it often does trouble intervened 
i last talked with my wife on aug 5 when i thought id be 
home in september said ltjg paul drennan a propulsion 
officer on the scott the next day we were heading into the red 
sea and i dont know when ill talk to her let alone see her

cheneys visit to combat troops at a windswept and sweltering 
air base in saudi arabia posed a particularly interesting problem 
for defense specialists 
as cheney moved swiftly from camouflaged tent to tank to command 
center several dozen reporters television cameramen and 
photographers raced after him jumping over tent wires ammunition 
boxes anything and everyone no matter how lethally armed in 
their attempt to glean a word or picture of the secretarys visit 
with the troops 
it took some time before the military officers restored any 
semblance of order leaving the impression that defending cheney 
from the queries of newshungry journalists might be akin to 
defending saudi arabia from iraq

midwest corn fields are getting a chance 
to pinch hit for middle east oil fields 
the us energy department has recommended steppedup production 
of ethanol a cornbased moonshine that is blended with gasoline to 
make cleanerburning gasohol 
the call for more ethanol is part of a scramble to ease the loss 
of middle east oil arising from iraqs invasion of kuwait this 
month gasohol is approved for use in most vehicles and proponents 
say its time has come 
theres no question in my mind its the logical thing to do 
said wayne ryan who raises corn near wapello in southeastern iowa 
since ethanol was introduced in 1978 more than 800 million 
miles have been traveled using ethanol blends according to the 
iowa corn promotion board gasohol is 10 percent ethanol 
every year theres a new crop but every time you take a 
barrel of oil out of a domestic oil well it is closer to running 
dry said marty andreas a vice president at 
archerdanielsmidland co adm of decatur ill the nations 
largest ethanol processor 
a bushel of corn produces about 2 gallons of ethanol last 
year about 1 billion gallons of ethanol were produced nationwide 
from more than 360 million bushels of corn 
the government estimates us farmers will harvest 785 billion 
bushels of corn this fall one out of every five bushels will come 
from iowa the nations leading corn producer 
its renewable its domestic and ethanol is benign andreas 
said 
he said the energy department on wednesday asked ethanol 
industry officials how much idle capacity could be brought into 
production and was told that an additional 150 million to 175 
million gallons could be produced each year 
despite the increase in gasohol interest some warn that ethanol 
cannot shoulder the nations fuel burden 
the 1 billion gallons of ethanol produced last year compares 
with 115 billion gallons of gasoline consumed in the united states 
said david zinanon vice president of petroleum industries research 
associates a new york consulting firm 
even if ethanol production rises substantially in the years 
ahead it will remain only a small part of the us energy picture 
he said 
still ethanol has a strong cadre of supporters who list its 
benefits 
increased reliance on domestic fuels would help shrink the 
nations trade deficit and its dependence on foreign suppliers the 
united states imports more than half its oil in the first five 
months of 1990 iraq accounted for 74 percent of us oil imports 
according to the american petroleum institute 
with 10 percent ethanol gasoline burns cleaner reducing 
hazardous emissions of carbon monoxide the government said 
arizona colorado new mexico and nevada have programs that rely on 
ethanol blends to reduce pollution 
a major byproduct of ethanol production is corn gluten feed a 
protein supplement for livestock feed that is in demand at home and 
abroad 
andreas said the industry needs an extension in federal tax 
subsidies to maintain what has been a marginally profitable 
business 
the tax break forgives 6 cents of a 9cent federal excise tax on 
each gallon of ethanol sold by an oil company the subsidy is set 
to expire in three years 
rg ensz a spokesman for the american petroleum institute 
said ethanol production is not profitable without the tax break he 
added that studies disagree on whether ethanol production is 
energyefficient 
he said the energy used in transporting and processing the fuel 
together with the fuel used by tractors and other equipment in 
working the corn fields can use up as much energy as you make 
but ryan said he uses 23 gallons of diesel and some petroleum in 
nitrogen fertilizer to cultivate and harvest each acre which 
brings enough corn to produce 250 to 300 gallons of ethanol

rock fans of all generations 
climbed a prague hill and ignored a pouring rain sunday to hear the 
rolling stones a band once vilified by the communist government as 
a capitalist moneymaking machine 
whats a little acid rain between friends quipped lead 
singer mick jagger when the summer rain began falling on the crowd 
of 110000 during the saturday night show 
he used his newly acquired czech to occassionally address the 
crowd between songs 
several teenage girls had to be carried away on stretchers 
after fainting during the sixhour wait for the group at strahov 
stadium 
shortly before midnight an anonymous caller told the events 
organizers that a bomb had been planted in the stadium 
while the group played jumpin jack flash about 100 
policemen searched the gigantic stage structure but found no 
evidence of explosives 
shortly before the performance the rolling stones were received 
by president vaclav havel at hradcany castle the former dissident 
playwright became president in december after a peaceful revolution 
toppled the countrys hardline communist leaders 
in the conversation with mick jagger and other members of the 
band the president expressed his joy over the fact that the 
concert is taking place and spoke of the role rock music played in 
the events leading to the november revolution and the revolution 
itself the czechoslovak news agency ctk reported 
proceeds from the concert are to go to the czechoslovak 
childrens foundation set up by olga havlova the presidents wife 
i have listened to their music very often songs like 
satisfaction are hard to forget and if their show is at least 
half as good as people say i cant wait to see them live with my 
very own eyes havel told rock amp pop magazine earlier 
the playwrightturned president is a wellknown supporter of the 
arts one of his close advisers michael kocab a former rock star 
was also present at the meeting 
i told mick i used to do rock n roll too but now i am more 
into heavy metal said kocab a parliamentary deputy who is 
overseeing the withdrawal of soviet tanks from czechoslovakia 
another parliamentary deputy veteran rock singer vladimir 
misik opened the concert with his band etc in the early 1980s 
the band was banned from performing in czechoslovakia 
it borders on science fiction out there we all started 
shaking only after the show misik said as he popped open a 
bottle of champagne a gift from the rolling stones to his band 
listening to etc backstage bobby keyes a saxophone player 
currently playing with the rolling stones said its very good 
stuff considering those guys had to work in such terrible 
conditions all their lives 
chuck leavell a keyboard player added the people seem to 
understand what rock n roll is about

rep bill frenzel always seems disgruntled 
its just the nature of the senior minnesota republican 
so when frenzel released his recent recap of this years budget 
talks it was no surprise to see it titled diary of a 
disgruntled summiteer 
but glancing through his notes and comments would make most 
citizens disgruntled too seen as a whole the threemonth old 
budget summit is clearly less than the sum of the hot rhetoric that 
has surrounded it 
frenzel the senior republican on the house budget committee 
recalls back in early may how president bush issued his no 
preconditions statement the first hint that bush was abandoning 
his pledge not to raise taxes 
now things should move frenzel says 
but of course they didnt 
the diary is loaded with recitations of the daily crises that 
seem ridiculous in retrospect but which at every turn threatened 
to derail the negotiations 
perhaps both sides can settle down to serious bargaining 
looking for a jump start it is an opening bid to get things 
moving a sign of progress he writes at various points 
as the talks got older the two sides seemed to meet more and 
accomplish less closed summit meeting produces hot words and no 
discernible progress frenzel notes for july 19 
sometimes the debate takes on an almost absurd quality 
for example in meetings on may 22 and may 24 the negotiators 
decide not to decide on a 50 billion deficit reduction target 
for this years package and 500 billion over five years 
two months later on july 24 whoopee the group decides 
those goals are okay 
what happened in the intervening weeks 
the budget situation got worse of course new administration 
estimates show red ink in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 will be 
near 170 billion not including the cost of the savings and loan 
bailout 
the 50 billion deficitreduction goal for next year seems 
modest indeed but does that drive the negotiators closer to a 
solution 
no meetings no progress frenzel says of the last days 
before congress departed for its summer recess 
curmudgeonly and partisan frenzel naturally blames the 
democrats for most of the problems in the talks and the central 
message of his diary isnt really news even a casual follower of 
washingtons ways knows that the budget summit has been a flop 
the frenzel diary could easily be discounted as yet another gop 
attempt to set the foundation for pinning the eventual failure of 
the talks on the democrats who control congress bush has made 
several clumsy attempts and the democrats have of course tried 
to return the favor 
but whats truly disheartening about the diary is what isnt in 
there at no point does frenzel mention any pressure from the 
public on the negotiators to get their job done 
if anything it alludes to lawmakers reactions to public 
demands not to raise taxes and not to cut their benefits thats 
been the formula for stalemate for years 
the negotiators will resume their efforts next month possibly 
with a private retreat away from the pressures of inquiring 
reporters lobbyists and others who might distract from the task 
at hand 
but after three months of relatively little public pressure why 
would further insulating the negotiators make an agreement more 
likely 
frenzel is stepping off the treadmill retiring from the seat he 
first won in 1970 so his political future doesnt ride much on the 
outcome of the talks hes been mentioned as a possible future 
secretary of commerce because of his expertise in trade as a member 
of the ways and means committee 
with no reelection campaign at stake frenzels frustration may 
actually stem from his desire to get something done about the 
deficit before leaving congress 
taking readings on his disgruntlement may be one way to monitor 
the progress of the talks ahead

the naacp and more than 100 other 
organizations ranging from law enforcement to religious groups have 
formed a coalition to battle nagging social ills in black 
communities 
the group calling itself the national association of black 
organizations grew out of a threeday summit conference of black 
organizations in washington assembled by the national association 
for the advancement of colored people 
coalition members which include groups as varied as the 
national organization of black law enforcement executives and the 
progressive national baptist convention will focus their efforts 
on such problems as teenage pregnancy school dropouts and other 
social problems 
naacp executive director benjamin hooks said the coalition is 
designed to enhance the continuing struggle of african americans 
to gain a fair share of the american dream 
the organizations plans call for establishment of a 
communications network to share information development of a brain 
trust to research and make recommendations on social and economic 
concerns affecting blacks spreading of effective selfhelp 
initiatives and development of strategies to strengthen support 
for black institutions 
the naacp moves in a new direction with the formation of the 
coalition the nations preeminent civil rights organization has 
traditionally focused on legislation and litigation 
what we have accomplished here is but a beginning hooks 
said it marks the start of a new approach where the visible 
payoff is farther down the road 
hooks said the naacp does not intend to turn from its historical 
focus but he said the 81yearold group also realizes the need for 
black organizations to address problems facing blacks 
we as black people are stepping up to the bat and saying we 
are taking responsibility for our own destiny hooks said 
he said the coalitions ninemember executive committee would 
meet within two weeks to work out further details

shipping radios crackled today with the 
sound of us warships challenging almost every commercial vessel 
in the southern persian gulf shipping executives reported 
but at midday there were no iraqi vessels in the area 
even the two iraqi freighters that were anchored there for 
days are no longer around said one of the executives referring 
to the alabid and albaya 
the shipping executives said they believed that baghdad ordered 
iraqi shipping away from the area while us defense secretary dick 
cheney was visiting the united arab emirates where he arrived 
early today from bahrain 
two iraqi freighters last week were refused entry by united arab 
emirates ports on the gulf while two iraqi tankers were refused 
entry by saudi arabia on the red sea on the other side of the 
arabian peninsula 
the four vessels were anchored in international waters off both 
coasts 
the shipping standoff escalated with the first warning shots 
fired saturday by us warships at two iraqi tankers that refused 
to stop for inspection as they were sailing out the strait of 
hormuz at the mouth of the persian gulf 
the two tankers the 36397ton baba gurgur and the 35338ton 
khanaqin were empty 
saddam hussein must have just sent them sailing down to test 
the us reaction after us president george bushs order to use 
force if necessary in the socalled interdiction said one of the 
shipping sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the usled interdiction effort is an outgrowth of the un 
trade embargo imposed on iraq after its aug 2 invasion and 
subsequent annexation of kuwait 
this is us navy warship this is us navy warship one of 
the warships was overheard to radio today on the vhf channel that 
was being monitored then it asked for last port of call and 
destination 
they are calling every vessel every tanker said one of the 
shipping executives its all going on normally with all the 
ships cooperating 
he said the only problem was when sailors could not understand 
english in those cases they would call the captain to continue 
the exchange in english the international maritime language 
most vessels contacted were tankers sailing to and from the 
saudi arabian oil terminal of ras tanura and other saudi ports 
thank you for your cooperation the us warships were 
invariably responding as they ended one radio challenge to turn to 
the other 
the shipping executives said the radio contacts were begun this 
morning by the british warships allies of the united states in the 
interdiction effort then the americans took over later in the day

jurors in the central park jogger case said the 
mood in the jury room was often tense but they were never split 
along racial lines 
the first thing we did in the jury room was to decide whether 
or not this case had racial overtones and we all decided it did 
not that cleared the air jury foreman earle fisher said 
over the next 10 days the panel made up of four blacks four 
whites three hispanics and one asian considered the charges 
against three of six youths charged with brutally attacking a 
female jogger who was raped beaten and left for dead 
the verdicts were announced saturday evening yusef salaam 16

east germanys embattled prime minister said 
today he will also act as foreign minister following the 
resignation of the countrys top diplomat 
lothar de maiziere told a news conference in east berlin he was 
taking the action to keep the process of german unification on 
track 
foreign minister markus meckel quit earlier today after his 
political party bolted from the broad governing coalition formed to 
lead the nation to unity with west germany 
meckel a topranking member of the leftleaning social 
democrats is the fifth minister to leave the coalition in a week 
de maiziere previously dismissed four other ministers in a 
political dispute that led to the social democrats decision to 
leave the coalition formed after the nations first free elections 
on march 18 
the social democrats the secondbiggest party in parliament 
voted on sunday to leave the government and vowed to speed the 
process of german unity 
the party said it would seek a vote in parliament on wednesday 
to advance the date for german unification to midseptember 
there is hardly another alternative said the social 
democrats deputy chairman karlaugust kamilli 
the social democrats were the secondlargest party in the 
coalition led by de maizieres conservative christian democrats 
pressure has been building in east germany to unify quickly with 
west germany so the richer country can deal directly with the 
former communist countrys difficult transition to the free market 
the social democrats in both germanys also want unification to 
take place much sooner than elections so west german chancellor 
helmut kohl can be held accountable at the voting booth for the 
costs of bailing out east germany 
east germany can invoke a clause in the west german constitution 
and unite with west germany at any time de maiziere and kohl have 
been trying to keep the election date and the unification date 
close together 
german unification is now tentatively set for oct 14 with 
allgerman elections to be held on dec 2 
the east german social democrats had been threatening to leave 
the coalition for weeks a smaller liberal alliance left the 
government earlier this month 
the bickering peaked last week when de maiziere unilaterally 
fired four ministers in his cabinet three of whom dealt with the 
nations crumbling economy 
the social democrats accused de maiziere of firing the ministers 
to protect his party politically when voters in both nations choose 
which party will lead a united germany 
the social democrats are closely allied with the west german 
social democrats the main opposition to kohl kohl like de 
maiziere is a christian democrat 
the departure of the social democrats will not derail the 
process of merging the two germanys but it does solidify the 
partys role as an opposition force in east germany 
all major east german parties are committed to unification but 
they differ sharply on a timetable and on the details of a state 
treaty that is to mesh the laws of the two germanys 
the collapse of the broad politically diverse coalition chosen 
after east germanys first free elections on march 18 is yet 
another psychological blow to a nation already reeling from a 
hemorrhaging economy 
joblessness and prices has skyrocketed ever since the nation 
shed four decades of socialism for the free market on july 1 by 
merging its economy with west germanys 
the social democrats rebuffed de maizieres lastminute offer to 
discuss their differences the prime minister said he made the 
offer because we in the interests of the people of east germany 
must solve our difficult problems together 
he called the social democrats decision a flight from 
responsibility 
with the loss of the social democrats de maiziere will lack the 
guaranteed twothirds majority in parliament needed to approve the 
unification treaty with west germany 
kohls government has warned that that could mean that west 
german laws would be imposed unilaterally on east germany 
the treaty being negotiated now seeks to preserve some east 
german laws the country for example has tougher drunken driving 
rules and more liberal abortion laws

opec said today there was not enough 
support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider 
saudi arabias request to boost oil production 
a brief statement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said its president algerian mines minister sadek 
boussena would meet with some other oil ministers before the end 
of the month to discuss the situation it did not elaborate 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said saturday his 
country would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels 
a day with or without the support of opec 
he had urged the cartel to hold a special session to try to take 
measures to bring down oil prices which have soared because of the 
middle east crisis 
but the statement issued by opecs headquarters in vienna said 
that an extraordinary meeting of the opec conference has not been 
able to secure the necessary support of seven of the groups 13 
members 
an extraordinary meeting of the opec conference will 
consequently not be held the statement said 
saudi arabias pledge to increase its production by as much as 2 
million barrels a day would make up about half of the crude lost to 
world markets because of the international embargo on oil shipments 
from iraq and kuwait 
the kingdom the worlds no 1 oil exporter was pumping about 
53 million barrels of oil a day at the end of july according to 
the international energy agency

officials kept a wary eye on the sky and 
on a leaking dam after workers laboring under emergency lights 
sandbagged a leaky dam early today to protect homes from a 
rainswollen lake 
heavy rain and the threat of a dam break forced the evacuation 
of a hospital and apartments for the elderly sunday and residents 
in the sparsely populated area below the dam were advised to leave 
or get ready to evacuate 
a flash flood watch was posted today for the northern third of 
indiana including the rochester area but as of midmorning the 
rain was intermittent 
the dam is holding its own right now said lisa carr a 
dispatcher with the fulton county sheriffs department at this 
point were just keeping our fingers crossed 
if we dont get any more rain well be all right mayor 
philip thompson had said earlier 
workers sunday night and early today at lake manitou hauled 
sandbags and rock to shore up the 5foothigh earth and concrete 
dam then called it quits leaving volunteers and state officials 
to watch for signs of deterioration 
carr said sandbagging efforts had not resumed as of midmorning 
but added if anything should happen well be out there again 
early sunday 50 to 75 people were evacuated from the waterhaven 
apartments and 26 of the 28 patients at woodlawn hospital were 
moved to a nursing home and a gym 
lake manitou is about 12 feet above mill creek which flows 
along the eastern edge of rochester a town of 5000 in 
northcentral indiana 
a complete failure of the 42yearold dam could raise mill creek 
by 6 feet the weather service said it would crest in rochester 
within a half hour 
the biggest problem it would affect would be our hospital if 
the dam was to go out a large quantity of water would hit it 
said robert bryant fulton county chief jailer 
at least 1000 people including volunteers fire crews civil 
defense officials and groups from two rochester high school class 
reunions filled sandbags and laid about 13000 along the dam early 
sunday bryant said 
an elderly woman suffered an apparent heart attack during the 
sandbagging authorities said her condition was not immediately 
available 
three workers were treated for heat exhaustion 
thompson said two channels were cut to divert lake water and 
ease pressure on the 150yard stretch of dam and earthen levee 
bruce c murray of the army corps of engineers said sunday that he 
believed the dam would hold 
earlier in the weekend a similar threat faced the westcentral 
wisconsin town of tomah about 1500 people evacuated their houses 
when high water threatened to rupture the lake tomah dam on the 
lemonweir river 
about 700 people stayed out of their homes during the night but 
were able to return sunday 
tomah got about 8 inches of rain in three hours late friday 
the dam was reinforced with about 20000 sandbags and its 
reservoir dropped eight inches by saturday night after the 
floodgates were opened said tomah fire chief tom flock

conditions and logistical challenges a commanding general said 
today 
we are ready to do whatever we need to do said maj gen 
john hopkins head of the 7th marine expeditionary brigade based in 
twentynine palms calif 
the brigade has deployed in a commercial port and surrounding 
desert in the eastern province of saudi arabia 
for security reasons the defense department has barred 
reporters from disclosing specific information such as the number 
of marines in saudi arabia their location and the number of 
weapons they carrying 
so far about 90 percent of the equipment the brigade needs has 
flowed into saudi arabia hopkins told reporters 
were not battleready right this moment but well be ready 
pretty shortly he said 
although the brigade trained in the mojave desert hopkins said 
even he was overwhelmed by the vastness of the arabian desert 
where tempertures routinely soar to 130 degrees 
we are going through growing pains and all the troops are 
getting acclimatized he said adding he feels damn confident 
the equipment the marines brought with them will enable them to 
fight on land in the air 
the brigade has carried weapons for every conceivable wartime 
situation including m60 tanks high utility multipurpose 
vehicles howitzers tow missiles 40 milimeter grenade launchers 
harrier jets cobra helicopters equipped with sidewinder missiles 
and tows huey helicopters for command and control ch46 
socalled sea knights to transport people and widebellied c150 
transport planes 
all told five cargo ships some were based in the pacific 
island of diego garcia will unload materiel for the brigade most 
of the equipment including the helicopters has to be reasembled 
on the ground 
it is the first time since formation of the preposition program 
in 1979 that it has been used in a contingency situation officials 
said 
but a brigade typically has about 16500 men pentagon officials

kingdom 
expeditionary units are designed to become combatcapable in 10 
days and sustain itself for 30 days without resupply

they have set up tents covered by camoflauge netting to escape the 
sun and avoid detection from above 
aviators and maintenance crews are working 16 hours to 18 hours 
a day to ready their craft and learn the terrain 
despite harsh conditions lt col mm kurth said there was a 
sense of excitement among marines who are eager to try out 
what theyve learned in real life 
morale is very high he said

a large jump in the number of people eligible 
for food stamps and welfare benefits this year is costing states 
and the federal government billions of dollars a published report 
said today 
at least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment with 
some rising up to 50 percent according to an agriculture 
department report quoted in the new york times 
the number of people receiving food stamps rose by 13 million 
from may 1989 to may 1990 when it topped 20 million for the first 
time since 1985 found a report submitted to congress by the 
agriculture department 
the department which administers the food stamp program noted 
that food stamp rolls have risen 16 percent in the last year in 
texas 19 percent in florida 26 percent in nevada 54 percent in 
new hampshire 12 percent each in georgia and massachusetts 7 
percent each in new york state and california and 21 percent in 
connecticut 
congress appropriated 148 billion but that proved inadequate 
and it had to provide an additional 12 billion in may it then 
directed the agriculture department to investigate the causes 
the department report said that 44 states and the district of 
columbia experienced a growth in participation in the food stamp 
program over the last year while the nations unemployment rate 
was relatively stable 
it also said many states are showing signs of economic 
slowdown that are not reflected in national economic indicators 
the times said michigan even blamed the increase in welfare 
caseload on a state ban on medicaidfinanced abortions 
f charles peller a spokesman for the states department of 
social services reported a startling increase in the number of 
aid to families with dependent children program cases about a year 
after the ban took effect 
the newspaper said federal and state authorities also believe 
tne numbers of welfare and food stamp recipients rose after 
congress made changes in the medicaid program which made the 
welfare system more accessible to some women 
and authorities also note that some states such as texas are 
aggressively trying to make social welfare benefits and services 
more available by simplifying application forms and allowing 
potential participants to apply for multiple programs at a single 
site 
in addition federal officials say some increase in food stamp 
rolls may have resulted from the immigration law under which 
thousands of illegal aliens have gained legal status since 1987

the central park jogger case touched raw nerves 
among new yorkers from the time the victim was found close to death 
in a puddle of mud and blood until the jury pronounced its verdict 
people were horrified by the viciousness of the attack in april 
new yorkers were inspired by the victims recovery and cheered by 
reports of her highfiving a nurse 
as a woman i cant tell you how much my heart goes out to 
her gina smith a 33yearold neighbor said at the time i 
just hope god does his best for her 
feelings of horror about the crime soon turned to deep anger 
much of it toward the suspects and because the victim was a white 
investment banker and the suspects were black youngsters there 
were charges that the media and criminal justice system had found 
them guilty even before they appeared in court 
a jury on saturday found three teenagers guilty of rape and 
assault but innocent of the most serious charge attempted murder 
in a statement today on behalf of the jogger salomon brothers 
spokeswoman lisa barowitz said she has no comment as there are 
still other legal proceedings pending the jogger is a vice 
president at salomon brothers 
assistant district attorney elizabeth lederer who prosecuted 
the case also refused to discuss the joggers reaction to the 
verdict saying i respect her privacy 
the new york post today quoted an unidentified source as saying 
the jogger said thank god this is over when she heard the 
news she was thrilled she was relieved she was grateful to the 
jurors the newspaper quoted the source as saying she called 
them wonderful people 
the trial raised issues of race sex and class and the 
difficulty of maintaining a presumption of innocence in the wake of 
intense publicity 
calvin o butts iii a prominent black minister said during 
deliberations that in the days and weeks just after the attack 
so convincing was the coverage that everyone assumed guilt 
ninety percent of the people i talked to black and white 
thought they were guilty it was an outrage over the crime he 
said only recently people began to realize there was some 
reasonable doubt 
a week after the attack barbara campbell a writer on 
childrens issues said my first reaction had been one of horror 
that young people had hurt someone so badly but shortly thereafter 
i read the news reports that portrayed the children as bestial 
with the implication that they were not human they were animals 
and i became angry about that 
all the elements were there for a big story the class 
difference between the victim and the alleged attackers the 
brutality and randomness of the attack its location in central 
park the heart of the city the victims miraculous recovery and 
return to work at salomon brothers the young age of the alleged 
attackers 
others argued that it became headline news simply because the 
victim was white and the suspects were black 
there was a feeding frenzy on the part of the white press 
electronic as well as print to bring somebody anybody to 
justice said wilbert tatum editor in chief of the amsterdam 
news a major black newspaper in the city it was because of the 
nature of the profile of the woman who had been attacked and 
because they were tough black boys rather than young white boys 
edwin diamond media critic for new york magazine said coverage 
of the case especially by local news stations was sensational 
shallow and unclear but not because the media are biased against 
blacks 
i believe had this victim been a black or hispanic 
wellesleyyale salomon brothers investment banker it would have 
been a bigger story he said i dont believe the media is 
racist but classist and melodramatic 
the sockemhard headline and soundbite only stir things up and 
do nothing to clarify a highly charged story like the jogger case 
diamond said he cited the term wilding which made headlines 
after it supposedly was used by a suspect in the jogger attack to 
describe a crime spree by a group of youths 
it put forward the most stereotypical images of blacks 
the wild thing it hooked into rap and rock and white fears of 
the mob he said 
during the trial tensions ran high outside the courthouse 
womens groups cried out against violence against women news 
photographers were punched by supporters of the defendants a row 
of family and supporters of the defendants walked out of the 
courtroom during the prosecutions summation the victim was 
taunted as a prostitute 
carla richmond spokeswoman for the new york city chapter of the 
national organization for women accused the media of emphasizing 
the racial issue over the sexism of the attack 
it has to do with our attitudes about women and sexist 
attitudes that go back a long way seeing the victim as being 
guilty she said

iraqi soldiers today were winding up 
their withdrawal from occupied iranian territory the official 
iranian news agency said freeing up thousands of battlehardened 
troops to face us forces 
on sunday defense secretary dick cheney said the number of 
iraqi troops poised on the kuwaiti border with saudi arabia had 
jumped from 160000 to 200000 that suggested iraqi soldiers from 
the iranian border regions might already be bolstering those in 
iraqoccupied kuwait 
the iraqi withdrawal from iranian border areas began friday and 
was expected to be completed tuesday 
cheney inspecting us forces in the persian gulf region 
refused to say how many american troops had been deployed the us 
troops were sent to protect strategic oilrich saudi arabia after 
iraqs aug 2 takeover of kuwait 
tehran newspapers today attacked the us military presence in 
saudi arabia and predicted the saudi monarch king fahd would meet 
the same fate as the deposed emir of kuwait 
in an editorial the newspaper jomhuri islami accused the king 
of allowing the united states to make saudi arabia a virtual us 
state 
just as iraq annexed kuwait to its territory the united 
states has annexed saudi arabia to its realm said the newspaper 
according to irna 
however the newspaper stressed that although it opposed the 
us military presence it also opposed the iraqi takeover of 
kuwait 
the iraqi withdrawal from iranian border areas came as part of 
an initiative by iraqi president saddam hussein last week to 
formally end the iraniraq war fighting in the eightyear 
iraniraq conflict had effectively ended with a ceasefire two 
years ago 
in irans southern region near the persian gulf departing iraqi 
troops shouted down with the us and allahu akbar 
god is great irans official islamic republic news agency 
said 
irna said the departing iraqis expressed desires for more 
brotherly relations between their countries and waved to their 
former enemies as they pulled out of fortifications along the 
30milelong shalamchehkushk axis 
the troop withdrawal is accompanied by the biggest prisoner 
exchange since world war ii the united nations and diplomats say 
the two sides held a total of 100000 prisoners 
tehran radio reported that 2000 prisoners returned to the 
iranian capital today in a jubilant homecoming 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said thousands of relatives 
and wellwishers thronged tehrans mehrabad airport and crowded 
surrounding streets the prisoners were showered with flowers and 
sheep were sacrificed for a traditional islamic welcome 
iraqs army daily newspaper alqaddisiyah had reported that 
some of the troops formerly deployed along the 730mile iraniraq 
frontier would be sent south to confront us forces in saudi 
arabia 
the new iraqi troop arrivals in kuwait are likely to include 
elements of the battlehardened 3rd and 7th army corps which saw 
some of the heaviest fighting of the persian gulf war 
when the unbrokered ceasefire of august 1988 took effect 
iraq was occupying an estimated 700 square miles of iranian 
territory in the western and southern border sectors

president bush today signed into law new 
federal and state logexport restrictions to help offset lost 
timber jobs and reduced harvests expected to result from protection 
of the rare northern spotted owl in the pacific northwest 
the new law is designed to bolster the timber supply for 
domestic timber processors it bans exports of unprocessed logs 
from most stateowned lands in the west 
the restrictions will have the biggest impact in washington 
oregon and northern california where dramatic timber harvest 
reductions are anticipated because of federally mandated protection 
of oldgrowth forests inhabited by the spotted owl 
the prohibitions are included in a trade bill bush signed today 
before giving a speech in baltimore a white house spokeswoman said 
about one in four logs currently cut in the northwest is shipped 
to more lucrative foreign markets 
under the new law washington will be allowed to continue to 
export 25 percent of its stateowned logs rawlog exports will be 
banned outright in oregon california idaho montana nevada 
wyoming utah colorado arizona and new mexico 
the export ban is expected to keep at home more than 600 million 
board feet of timber annually that currently is being exported 
that includes about 350 million board feet on washington state 
lands and 100 million board feet on oregon state lands 
the new law also makes permanent the prohibition on raw log 
exports from federal lands in the west and close loopholes in that 
ban those loopholes called direct and indirect substitution 
have enabled some timber companies to obtain federal logs from a 
third party for their domestic mills while shipping their own 
private logs overseas 
in each of the last two years about 36 billion board feet of 
unprocessed timber has been exported from washington and oregon 
about 80 percent of the total nationally 
a board foot is a piece of timber onefoot wide by onefoot long 
and one inch thick

operation desert shield proves vividly that instead of relieving 
past contingencies we must prepare for the challenges of the 1990s 
and beyond 
by ensuring that our troops are ready and trained we can exert 
our presence in key areas and respond effectively to crisis and 
this is readiness measured in days and hours not weeks and months 
and operation desert shield has underscored the need to be able to 
get our soldiers where they are needed and when they are needed 
this kind of responsiveness will be critical in the crises of the 
future 
recently our outstanding chairman of the joint chiefs general 
colin powell spoke to this when he praised the finest peacetime 
military in the history of america we will be smaller in troop 
strength and restructured but we will remain purposeful proud 
and effective 
just look at the last 18 days desert shield has been a classic 
case of americas military at its best i think for instance of 
airman 1st class wade west home on leave to be married on august 
7 he was called up and within an hour he had the ceremony 
performed and left for the middle east hes now stationed over in 
saudi arabia you talk about a guy that gets things done 
but i would like to emphasize with his bride wherever she 
may be 
and another example seven years ago diana kroptivich worried 
at home while her husband walter steamed off the lebanon coast on 
the uss new jersey defending the marines today their roles are 
reversed retired walter is at home with their 6yearold son and 
diana serves aboard the destroyer uss yellowstone here heres an 
army couple 
today paratrooper joseph hooter of the 82nd airborne division 
is serving in saudi arabia and his wife nurse dominique allen of 
the 44th medical brigade will be deployed there within the next 
two weeks 
and finally recall the 8 year old who watching her dad leave 
for the mediterranean spoke truth from the mouths of babes i 
just think she said that they shouldnt let daddies go away 
this long but they still have to to keep the world safe 
these profiles show the true caliber of america and the vital 
essence of our mission whats more they remind us of the fifth 
and final lesson reaffirmed by the past 18 days the need for a 
continued strong defense budget to support american troops 
or as george washington said in his first inaugural address 
to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of 
preserving the peace history has shown the wisdom of his words 
especially in our century 
what desert shield has shown is that america can ensure the 
peace by remaining militarily strong and now i know that were 
operating in a time of budget restraint we have limited resources 
we must use them wisely 
and the budget deficit is a threat to our vital interests at 
home and wont be made easier by todays threat abroad everyone 
realizes that the deficit is too large and that its got to be 
brought down and the congress must act courageously and 
immediately when it returns from recess 
but heres the point we cannot attack the deficit by attacking 
the very heart of our armed forces committed men and women who are 
motivated and ready and last week i asked congress to do what we 
have done produce a budget proposal including defense that is 
both responsive and responsible and most of all fair and when 
they do i will listen listen but not break faith with the troops 
who are defending our nation 
make no mistake to prevent aggression to keep america 
militarily prepared i will oppose the defense budget slashers who 
are out of tune with what america needs to keep freedom secure and 
safe 
you know most americans know that when it comes to national 
defense finishing second means finishing last and so they reject 
what the house armed services committee recently suggested 
unacceptable cuts from our defense budget for fiscal year 1991 
most americans know too that giving peace a chance does not 
mean taking a chance on peace and so they endorse giving the 
military the tools to do its job the peacemaker the midget man 
the b2 and the strategic defense initiative americans want arms 
negotiations to succeed but they know that even a start treaty 
will not help our security if we disarm unilaterally 
and let us never forget that our strong national defense 
policies have helped us gain the peace we need a strong defense 
today to maintain that peace and i will fight for that defense 
and i need your help so help me convince the congress given 
recent events to take another look into adequately defend to 
fund our defense budget 
let me tell you a little story about why i feel so strongly i 
was talking to some of the young soldiers who liberated panama we 
invited them to come with general thurman and others to the cabinet 
room for a briefing for me and i asked one of them a medic about 
the operation corporal roderick ringstaff spoke of combat and he 
spoke of the heroics of others but not of his own and next to him 
was his commanding officer and so his commanding officer filled in 
the rest 
this medic had been wounded but repeatedly braved fire to rescue 
other wounded pulling soldier after soldier to safety for that he 
was awarded the silver star for bravery and listening i thought 
to myself i will never send young men and women into battle with 
less than the very best that this nation can provide them i will 
never i will never ever let americans like this down 
august 1990 has witnessed what history will judge one of the 
most crucial deployments of allied powers since world war ii two 
weeks ago i called for the complete immediate and unconditional 
withdrawal of all iraqi forces from kuwait 
second the restoration of kuwaits legitimate government 
third the security and the stability of saudi arabia and the 
persian gulf and fourth the safety and protection of american 
citizens abroad 
and today i say those objectives are and will remain unchanged 
and will it take time of course for were engaged in a cause 
larger than ourselves a cause perhaps best shown by words many of 
you remember words spoken by one of the greatest americans of our 
time to allied soldiers and sailors and airmen the eyes of the 
world are upon you he told them the hopes and prayers of 
liberty loving people everywhere march with you 
and then he concluded with this moving prayer let us all 
beseech the blessing of almighty god upon this great and noble 
undertaking 
fellow veterans more than half of all vfw members fought in 
world war ii many of you serving under the man who spoke those 
words dwight david eisenhower and you know how america remains 
the hope of liberty loving people everywhere 
half a century ago the world had the chance to stop a ruthless 
aggressor and missed it and i pledge to you we will not make that 
mistake again together for you see together we can successfully 
oppose tyranny and help those nations who look to us for leadership 
and vision 
thank you for your support and your prayers and may god bless 
the land we deeply love the united states of america thank you 
all and god bless you

a 40yearold lawyer was charged today 
with killing of one of nine women believed to be victims of a 
serial killer 
kenneth c ponte entered a plea of absolutely not guilty 
during a superior court appearance after an indictment naming him 
was unsealed bond was set at 500000 he was released on bail at 
midday 
ponte 40 has frequently been named in news stories as a 
suspect in the case but until today prosecutors had not formally 
named him bristol district attorney ronald pina declined today to 
say whether ponte was a suspect in the other slayings 
the indictment accuses ponte of beating rochelle clifford 
dopierla to death april 27 1988 her body was discovered the 
following december 
dopierla was one of nine women whose bodies were found near this 
southeastern massachusetts community between july 1988 and april 
1989 pina said at todays hearing that ponte killed her because 
she was planning to expose his drug activities 
all the victims had histories of drug use and some were 
prostitutes two other women have also been missing and are 
presumed dead 
ponte who now lives in florida has acknowledged being a 
suspect in the case but has denied any involvement in the killings 
mr ponte welcomes a trial said defense attorney kevin 
reddington he needs a trial to clear his name 
pina said ponte crossed the line from the legal community and 
became a member of the drug community 
this man went into a drug world he recruited women he used 
them to purchase his drugs he brought them into his home pina 
said 
the indictment was issued by a grand jury that has been 
investigating the deaths since last year the grand jury spent most 
of last week examining evidence presented by pina in connection to 
the nine victims 
the indictment was sealed for a few days at pinas request so 
the victims relatives could be briefed 
on friday pina also asked that the grand jury not be discharged 
from further duties a request also granted by the judge 
new bedford investigators have reported that dopieralas mother 
told them her daughter once gave her pontes home telephone if her 
mother wanted to reach her in new bedford 
ponte has said his only contact with dopierala was in april 1988 
when he as a lawyer helped her with a man whom she accused of 
raping her 
dopieralas body was found in a different location from those of 
the other victims she was found near an abandoned gravel pit a 
quarter mile north of interstate 195 in dartmouth the other bodies 
were found by the side of highways in the area

police on monday evicted about 100 homeless 
israelis from a tent camp set up to protest israels severe 
housing shortage 
it was the first time authorities evicted people living in tent 
cities about 2000 israelis are living in such cities around the 
country to protest a housing shortage and skyrocketing rents 
resulting from the influx of soviet jews 
police detained five people who rioted when a backhoe arrived 
and demolished several stone and wooden huts in a camp in the tel 
aviv neighborhood of bnei brak said police spokeswoman aviv ivri 
reuven berger a senior official of the bnei brak municipality 
said the eviction was ordered after some of the 17 homeless 
families began building such permanent structures on a vacant lot 
where they had been allowed to pitch tents 
at that moment their plight took on the character of 
squatting and ceased being a protest he said 
berger said the municipality had supplied the homeless camp with 
electricity water and even hot meals for the children 
army radio said that after the eviction some of the homeless 
collected under a shelter in the lot saying they did not know 
where they would go 
you see this sand here this is where we will sleep tonight 
one homeless person said on israel radio 
the housing shortage was sparked several months ago by the 
influx of soviet jews which has reached about 80000 this year and 
may include 70000 others by january 
many rents have doubled and tripled in israel as a result of 
300 monthly government rent subsidies given the soviet jews they 
receive the money a year in advance and can pay rents in a lump 
sum the higher rents have displaced young couples and poor 
families

the governing motherland party won 11 
mayorships in local elections held in 14 towns according to final 
results announced monday 
it was impossible to gauge the overall strength of the party 
from the results since it lost in the largest district and barely 
won in another large district in sundays vote 
nevertheless premier yildirim akbulut claimed victory saying 
the trust of the citizens is in motherland 
a surprise winner was the democratic left party of former 
premier bulent ecevit it won the mayorship in bayrampasa a 
district of istanbul with 111000 registered voters it was the 
largest contested in the elections 
motherland won by a slim margin in etimesgut a suburb of ankara 
and the secondlargest district in the polls 
two extreme rightwing parties the moslem fundamentalist 
prosperity party and the nationalist work party improved their 
votes 
the two major opposition parties with representation in 
parliament the social democrat populist party and the conservative 
true path party of former premier suleyman demirel appeared to 
have lost votes since nationwide local elections in 1989 
the social democrats captured two mayorships but in most 
districts their support went down 
mayoral elections were held in these districts either because 
they had been upgraded from villages to small towns or had become 
separate municipalities such as bayrampasa 
in 1989 nationwide local elections the motherland won 217 
percent of the votes placing third behind the social democrats and 
true path

but this morning im also grateful to have this special 
opportunity to discuss an issue of great concern to all americans 
the crisis in the persian gulf a crisis that will require american 
planning patience and yes personal sacrifice 
but a crisis that we must and will meet if we are to stop 
aggression help our friends and protect our own interests in the 
peace and stability of countries around the globe 
eighteen days ago these beliefs prompted me to take action in 
the middle east to restore the sovereignty of kuwait and deter 
those who threaten friendly countries and the vital interests of 
america and i acted knowing that our cause would not be easy but 
that our cause is right 
and that while one should not underestimate those who endanger 
peace an even greater mistake would be to underestimate americas 
commitment to our friends when our friends are imperiled or our 
commitment to international order when that too is imperiled 
today the outcome is not yet decided hard choices remain but of 
this we are certain america will not be intimidated and when some 
ask where does america stand our answer is america stands 
where it always has against aggression against those who would 
use force to replace the rule of law 
and who better than this group know that throughout history 
weve learned that we must stand up to evil its a truth which the 
past 18 days have reaffirmed and its lessons speak to america and 
to the world 
the first lesson is as vivid as the memories of normandy khe 
sanh pork chop hill weve been reminded again that aggression 
must and will be checked and so at the request of our friends we 
have sent us forces to the middle east reluctantly but 
decisively knowing as teddy roosevelt said that america means 
many things among them equality of rights and therefore 
equality of duty and obligation 
and yet we are not acting alone but in concert hoping to 
protect our own national security interests as well as those of 
the broader community of nations 
which brings me to the second lesson reaffirmed by the past 18 
days by itself america can do much together with its friends and 
allies america can do much more for peace and for justice think 
back with me to world war ii when together allies confronted a 
horror which embodied hell on earth or korea where united nations 
forces opposed totalitarianism 
today once again many nations many of them muslim have 
joined to counter aggression and thus to restore the peace and 
our saudi friends under the wise leadership of king fahd ask for 
our help in deterring further aggression by iraq and i salute the 
many countries who have courageously responded to saudi arabias 
request 
i also salute those governments who are responding to the emir 
of kuwaits call for the full enforcement of united nations 
sanctions we must not delude ourselves iraqs invasion was more 
than a military attack on tiny kuwait it was a ruthless assault on 
the very essence of international order and civilized ideals 
and now in a further offense against all norms of international 
behavior iraq has imposed restrictions on innocent civilians from 
many countries this is unacceptable applause and thats why the 
united nations security council voted unanimously saturday night to 
condemn iraqs action just as it earlier voted to condemn the 
invasion itself 
they know as we do that leaders who use citizens as pawns 
deserve and will receive the scorn and condemnation of the entire 
world applause 
and so to the leaders of iraq ill now make two points clear in 
moving foreign citizens against their will you are violating the 
norms of your own religion you are going against the ageold arab 
tradition of showing kindness and hospitality to visitors 
and so my message is release all foreigners now give them the 
right to come and go as they wish adhere to international law and 
un security council resolution 664 
weve been reluctant to use the term hostage but when 
saddam husayn specifically offers to trade the freedom of those 
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for 
concessions there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent 
people are called they are in fact hostages 
and i want there to be no misunderstanding i will hold the 
government of iraq responsible for the safety and well being of 
american citizens held against their will 
let me also take a moment to thank president gorbachev for his 
recent words condemning the iraqi invasion he has shown if anyone 
doubted it that nations which joined to fight aggression in world 
war ii can work together to stop the aggressors of today 
a third lesson has also been reaffirmed by the last 18 days as 
veterans it wont surprise you the steadfast character of the 
american will look to the sands of saudi arabia and the waters 
offshore where brave americans are doing their duty just as you did 
at anzio and inchon and hamburger hill 
and think of the men and women aboard our planes and ships 
young alone and so very far from home they make us humble they 
make us proud and i salute the finest soldiers sailors airmen 
and marines that any nation could possibly have 
and moreover i pledge to you we will do whatever it takes to 
help them compete their mission 
this means realizing the fourth lesson reaffirmed by the past 18 
days although the size of americas armed forces in the years 
ahead will be smaller because the threat to our security is 
changing future american defense capacity must be even more a 
lean mean fighting machine and by 1995 we estimate that our 
security needs can be met by an active force 25 percent smaller 
than todays the lowest level since 1950 and yet we must ensure 
that a reduction of numbers does not mean a reduction in american 
strength

the next time jack mcelhinney gets a 
splinter he plans to take care of it himself the last one has 
cost more than 3700 to remove 
the 57yearold retired real estate broker had pulled most of 
the splinter out of his big toe and was able to jog and play 
tennis but the sliver annoyed him 
he went to his doctor who xrayed the toe and referred him to a 
surgeon who sent him to another physician when it became 
infected the doctor said hed have to go to the hospital to get it 
removed 
mcelhinney thought it would be a simple procedure then a clerk 
called and asked whether he had a will and had signed an organ 
donor card 
in retrospect thats the point at which i should have 
realized things had gotten out of control mcelhinney said in a 
story published in satudays tampa tribune 
he went underwent tests and the surgery was done under local 
anesthesia may 31 the splinter about a halfinch long and 
extremely thin was removed 
the hospital bill was 317711 the pathologists asked for 
19735 the anesthesiologists billed him 400 
i havent even gotten the surgeons bill yet theyll probably 
deliver that in a brinks truck mcelhinney said 
but the surgeon thomas dipasquale said his fee will be less 
than the hospitals bill extra tests may be unnecessary 95 percent 
of the time he said but malpractice insurance requires them 
mcelhinneys insurer paid 190627 of the 317711 bill he is 
supposed to pay 476 and the rest will be waived 
mcelhinney said he and his neighbors have a solution for the 
next splinter 
weve invested in a fancy firstaid kit he said well do 
the surgery ourselves

iraq said today it had moved western detainees to vital military 
targets making good on its threat to use them as human shields 
against a potential american attack 
the message came after iraq warned its own people not to hide 
foreigners or they would face the severest punishment 
iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as 
shields and todays statement by the official iraqi news agency 
said some had already been scattered at the target sites 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted a spokesman for the 
iraqi national council as saying iraqs foreign guests have been 
in fact moved to all vital and military installations they have 
been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good 
physical condition 
the threeline dispatch provided no further details such as how 
many foreigners had been moved or to what installations 
earlier president bush demanded that iraq release all 
foreigners detained in iraq and kuwait and for the first time he 
referred to them as hostages 
there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent 
citizens are called they are in fact hostages he said in a 
speech to war veterans in baltimore 
also today two senior un officials headed for baghdad to urge 
iraq to free foreigners held captive in kuwait and iraq un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said iraqi president 
saddam hussein requested the envoys be sent 
in his speech bush repeated us demands that iraq withdraw

a highspeed train plowed into the back of 
a slowmoving train in thick fog on the outskirts of warsaw on 
monday killing 16 people and injuring more than 50 officials said 
the force of the collision lifted the last car of the slower 
train off the track the engine of the speeding train ripped 
through the car as it passed underneath 
it was a macabre sight with the coach standing up and there 
was no floor said a fire brigade worker who was among the first 
to arrive at the scene after the 620 am crash 
the highspeed train was en route from prague to warsaw and was 
moving at about 60 mph when it hit the second train which was 
traveling at about 9 mph as it arrived from szklarska poreba in 
southwestern poland according to a statement from the polish 
railroad 
the cause of the crash was not immediately known emergency 
workers at the scene suggested the engineer of the prague train may 
not have seen the signal that caused the first train to slow down 
fortythree of the injured were hospitalized the official pap 
news agency said 
virtually all the victims appeared to be on the slower train 
one of them bogdan owsiak told polish television that most aboard 
were sleeping when the train was hit 
i managed to squeeze out through a crack and only when i fell 
to the ground did i see one of my legs was broken and i had an open 
wound owsiak said while we were waiting for ambulances we 
could hear people crying inside the train 
the prague train was not severely damaged 
the crash occurred near the sprawling ursus tractor factory six 
miles from the central warsaw train station 
bodies wrapped in plastic were lined up on a sidewalk as rescue 
workers used metal rods to pull upholstery and broken seats down 
from the wreckage 
an american embassy official at the scene said it did not appear 
there were any americans among the dead or injured

indicted monday in the deaths of more than 3400 people in poland 
during world war ii 
schwammberger 78 was extradited from argentina in may as a 
commander of concentration camps during the war he was accused of 
extreme cruelty including ripping the gold fillings from 
prisoners mouths before their deaths 
the indictment sets the stage for one of the last major nazi war 
crimes trials in germany 
prosecutors spokesman helmut krombacher said schwammberger was 
indicted in the deaths of at least 50 jews he was also charged 
as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3377 other 
people many of them jews as well krombacher said 
the trial is expected to take place at the beginning of next 
year the prosecutors spokesman said 
if convicted schwammberger faces a sentence of life in prison 
according to the indictment schwammbergers crimes stretched 
from 1941 to 1944 during world war ii 
during that time he served as a nazi ss boss in the polish 
cities of krakow and przemysl and as commandant of concentration 
camps in rozwadow and mielec in poland 
since his extradition schwammberger has admitted ordering the 
execution of one person under special circumstances but 
otherwise has denied the crimes krombacher said 
schwammberger was first captured by french soldiers in 1945 in 
innsbruck austria he had with him eight sacks of gold and 
jewelry which allegedly came from his victims according to 
authorities 
at that time schwammberger admitted to having shot to death 27 
jews krombacher said 
schwammberger escaped while being taken to salzburg in 1948 and 
fled to argentina where he lived for almost 40 years until being 
found and jailed last year he was sent to germany in may

10 mostwanted criminals from adolf hitlers third reich 
schwammberger born in 1912 in what is now the south tyrol 
region of northern italy is in stuttgarts maximumsecurity 
stammheim prison awaiting trial 
several aging nazi suspects have managed to delay or thwart

determine if schwammberger is competent to stand trial 
besides schwammberger there are few top nazi war criminals 
still to be brought to justice 
the no 1 fugitive is alois brunner who has been living in

zulus fired assault rifles at 
xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early monday leaving 22 
people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal 
clashes police said 
zulus and xhosas the countrys two largest black tribes and 
longtime rivals have been waging vicious battles since aug 12 in 
the townships surrounding johannesburg 
police and eyewitnesses said zulus armed with ak47 rifles 
raided a xhosa workers hostel early monday in kwathema township 
east of johannesburg at least 22 people were killed many of them 
xhosas shot in their beds they said 
police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order 
enraged xhosas set fire to a hostel used by zulus before being 
driven off 
fighting also flared in nearby townships resulting in several 
deaths 
looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by zulu migrant 
workers people carted away refrigerators stoves and anything else 
they could find 
johannesburg newspapers monday reported five killings sunday in 
the soweto township by the necklace method whereby youths put 
gasolinesoaked tires around the necks of victims and set them 
alight 
police on monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the 
past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured 
we just keep finding bodies theyre everywhere said a 
police spokesman 
the fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long 
history but it also has political overtones 
nelson mandela and many other leaders of the african national 
congress the largest opposition movement are xhosas the ancs 
rival inkatha is a zulubased organization headed by mangosuthu 
buthelezi 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid the system of racial 
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and 
economic control over 30 million blacks but the two groups differ 
over tactics and plans for a future south africa 
anc leader walter sisulu ruled out peace talks between mandela 
and buthelezi saying it would be a capitulation 
that means inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our 
knees for that type of thing we are not prepared he said in a 
weekend television interview 
mandelas wife winnie warned the anc may be forced to resume 
its armed struggle to protect is supporters the anc agreed aug 6 
to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign 
mrs mandela accused the government of working handinhand 
with the relatively conservative inkatha movement in the fighting 
against xhosas the independent south african press association 
reported 
also the government has revoked immunity from prosecution for 
three anc leaders including the head of the groups military wing 
chris hani 
the three men hani ronnie kasrils and mac maharaj also are 
members of the south african communist party a close anc ally 
the government gave no reason for the decision but it was seen 
as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements 
made recently by some anc leaders 
the trio are among more than 40 anc leaders granted temporary 
immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks 
all but hani kasrils and maharaj have had their immunity extended 
until the end of the year

president bush demanded today that iraq release 
all foreigners detained in iraq and kuwait saying whatever these 
innocent people are called they are in fact hostages 
he said a regime that uses civilians as pawns will face the 
scorn and condemnation of the entire civilized world 
as bush spoke for the first time describing the foreigners 
under iraqs saddam hussein as hostages the official iraqi news 
agency said some westerners have been moved to military targets 
scattered throughout iraq for use as shields to ward of aerial 
attacks from american planes and missiles in saudi arabia 
a short time later the state department said at least 12 
americans along with a number of other foreign nationals were 
taken from hotels in kuwaits capital and moved to undisclosed 
locations protests were lodged by us diplomats in kuwait and 
iraq but the whereabouts of the americans remained unknown 
spokesman richard boucher said 
bush did not discuss that developments in his speech to the 
national convention of the veterans of foreign wars 
the state department in an indication that the crisis was 
widening advised americans in jordan to consider leaving it 
ordered nonessential embassy personnel and dependents to leave 
yemen and urged americans to defer nonessential travel to both 
jordan and yemen 
the state department cited the continuing unstable conditions 
in the region as the reasons for its decision and also pointed to 
antiamerican demonstrations in sanaa the capital of yemen 
in his speech bush again compared saddam to adolf hitler and 
saddams takeover of kuwait to hitlers aggression against 
neighbors in the 1930s 
a half century ago the world had the chance of stopping a 
ruthless aggressor and missed it bush said and i pledge to 
you we will not make that mistake again 
later aboard his plane on a flight to a republican fundraising 
event in rhode island bush was asked if his use of the term 
hostages to describe the interned westerners was an escalation 
i dont think theres any turning up the heat he told 
reporters its a recognition of the fact that now demands are 
being made for the release of people and that i think is the 
definition of hostages 
about 3000 americans and thousands of other foreign citizens 
now are under iraqi control and the baghdad regime has said some 
of them will be held at military sites and other potential us 
targets as shields against air attack 
but bush said the united states will not be intimidated 
dealing with the foreigners denied the right to leave the crisis 
zone bush told the national vfw 
we have been reluctant to use the term hostage but when 
saddam hussain specifically offers to trade the freedom of those 
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for 
concessions there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent 
people are called they are in fact hostages 
and i want there to be no misunderstanding i will hold the 
government of iraq responsible for the safety and well being of 
american citizens being held against their will bush said 
a scant 12 hours before the bush address to about 10000 
veterans his spokesmen had carefully avoided calling the detained 
americans hostages but bush dropped the effort banged the rostrum 
and said the government of iraq is responsible for the safety of 
those it holds 
iraqs invasion was more than a military attack on tiny 
kuwait it was a ruthless assault on the very essence of 
international order and civilized ideals bush said and now in 
a further offense against all norms of international behavior iraq 
has imposed restrictions on innocent civilians from many 
countries 
beyond the demand that saddam hussein release the americans and 
others bush offered no details about how he would gain their 
freedom 
but he said america will not be intimidated and will stand 
against aggression 
bush flew to washington sunday evening to meet with top advisors 
on the persian gulf crisis then by baltimore for the vfw speech 
he was returning to kennebunkport maine later today to resume 
his vacation 
the presidents vfw appearance was delayed while he talked by 
telephone with president turgut ozal of turkey and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
defense secretary dick cheney on a trip to the gulf region 
announced earlier in the day that the united arab emirates had 
agreed to allow us c130 cargo transports to operate out of the 
moderate arab federation cheney who made the announcement along 
with the president of the emirates sheik zayed al nahyan was 
traveling later in the day to oman and saudi arabia to discuss the 
us military buildup 
sen john glenn dohio a member of the senate armed services 
committee said today we have to get enough forces there on the 
ground and really build up enough forces that there cant be any 
doubt about it glenn appearing on nbcs today show said 
you cant bluff in a situation like this if he saddam decides 
to call our bluff we have to have enough people in there 
bush flew back from maine on sunday evening to meet with top 
military and civilian national security advisers on the crisis 
the white house said us warships were still shadowing two 
iraqi tankers which ignored warning shots fired by the us ships 
on saturday 
press secretary marlin fitzwater speaking with reporters aboard 
air force one on sunday said the tankers were still several days 
out of port we intend to enforce the sanctions but we want to 
give them every opportunity to turn around and change course 
our only concern is that they not offload and violate the 
sanctions he said 
an administration source said theres nothing pushing an 
immediate action here weve stated our intent and many people are 
complying with the sanctions voluntarily the official insisting 
on anonymity also noted that the united nations is considering 
further action to enforce its sanctions 
undersecretary of state for political affairs robert kimmitt 
speaking sunday on nbc said the state department was urging 
americans to stay in their homes but not to resist if iraqi 
authorities try to move them 
iraqs ambassador to the united states mohamed sadiq almashat 
rejected suggestions that iraq was violating international norms 
when you deny our children food and milk what do you 
expect he said on abctvs this week with david brinkley he 
said the united states should stop beating the drums of war and 
work for peace because we are on the brink of a catastrophe for 
everybody

magellans mission to map venus will be 
delayed two days while engineers try to figure out why they 
temporarily lost touch with the spaceship last week nasa said 
monday 
the spacecrafts 243day mapping mission had been scheduled to 
begin aug 29 but now will start sept 1 said jim doyle 
spokesman for the national aeronautics and space administrations 
jet propulsion laboratory 
the spacecraft already has used its radar to make its first test 
pictures of the cloudcovered planet the laboratory plans to 
release those pictures tuesday scientists said last week the 
pictures show venusquake faults volcanic cinder cones and old 
lava flows 
engineers lost touch with magellan on thursday for nearly 15 
hours just after the spaceship sent those pictures to earth 
intermittent contact was restored midday friday then steady 
communication was reestablished friday night 
in an attempt to figure out the cause of the problem engineers 
spent the weekend unloading magellans memory banks after that 
task was completed sunday night the engineers started analyzing 
the information to diagnose the malfunction said tommy thompson 
magellan science manager 
he said engineers narrowed the cause of the communication 
problem to four or five possibilities 
magellan went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after a looping 
948 millionmile trip from earth it was launched from the space 
shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
the 744 million magellan mission aims to use radar to peer 
through venus thick clouds and make the best pictures yet of the 
planets landscape

defer all nonessential travel to yemen citing the iraqi invasion 
and antiamerican demonstrations in sanaa the capital of yemen 
nonessential embassy personnel and dependents were ordered to

at least 12 americans along with a number of 
other foreign nationals were taken from hotels in kuwaits capital 
and moved to undisclosed locations the state department said today 
protests were lodged by us diplomats in kuwait and iraq but 
the whereabouts of the americans remains unknown spokesman richard 
boucher said 
the americans were staying at the hyatt hilton and 
international hotels they are among an estimated 2500 americans 
in the persian gulf country that was overrun by iraqi forces three 
weeks ago 
a us official declining to be identified said the 12 include 
both men and women and at least one family he said he did not know 
if any children were amongground rules for reporters in the news media 
pool supervised by 
the pentagon prohibit disclosure of the exact locations of us 
forces here or specific details about the size of deployments 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity over the past 
few days described the kuwaitdirected troop and equipment 
movements and planning as routine military procedure 
i dont see us going into kuwait but if those orders ever came 
we would obviously want to be ready one senior us officer in 
saudi arabia said 
said another official if it came down to that we would have 
to move at lightning speed so obviously you take preliminary steps 
to bring up the level of readiness regardless of the current 
plans 
the us mission here is described as defensive and the first 
wave of troops and equipment to reach saudi soil were those that 
have trained in such tactics as antitank warfare that could be 
used to thwart an iraqi incursion into the saudi kingdom 
but in the past few days much of troops and materiel that have 
arrived and moved into forward positions have been those considered 
generally to be designed for offensive missions 
these include the beginning elements of the 101st airborne 
division an airassault assault unit which transports its troops 
with helicopters the 7th marine expeditionary brigade which 
includes tanks heavy artillery and cobra attack helicopters and 
other ground and naval forces usually geared toward offensive 
missions 
the battleship uss wisconsin passed through the suez canal on 
sunday and is expected to make its way around the arabian peninsula 
into the persian gulf from which it could assist in any offensive 
mission and marine amphibious forces also are arriving in the 
area according to the officials 
other attackoriented naval forces that are in the area aboard 
aircraft carriers include a6 attack bombers f18s and ea6b 
radarjamming planes designed to foul enemy communications during 
combat 
still the united states and other countries participating in 
the multinational defense force here are far short of the numbers 
military analysts believe would be necessary to mount a ground 
effort to force iraqi troops out of kuwait 
there are signs the offensiveoriented buildup is having an 
impact on iraqs strategy 
recent us intelligence indicates that while iraq is 
maintaining a formidable force near the kuwaitsaudi border it 
appears to be concentrating more on bolstering troops deployed in a 
crescentshaped line facing the gulf according to military 
officials 
it looks to me that they think the marines are coming 
ashore one officer familiar with intelligence reports said 
iraqs defense however includes strategically placed artillery 
and other fire that would make any shore assault particularly 
bloody another american official said 
the iraqi shifts appear to have decreased the prospect of an 
iraqi foray in saudi arabia said the officials who have been 
discounting that prospect more and more each day as the us force 
multiplies 
still en route is more heavy us firepower including elements 
of the 24th infantry division mechanized from georgia which is 
bringing its powerful m1 tanks 
and troops continue to arrive in large numbers many aboard 
commercial us airliners passenger jets from continental 
airlines twa united airlines and northwest airlines landed at a 
saudi air base monday carrying us troops and supplies

a movie about claus von bulow wont reveal 
whether the danish socialite lawyer tried to kill his heiress wife 
sunny but that hasnt stopped the actor who played von bulow from 
sympathizing with him 
acting a part is like a detective story youre following 
clues ive just got this gut feeling about many of the things von 
bulow did finally you work out a hypothesis and all the clues just 
drop in and you think thats it said actor jeremy irons 
the movie reversal of fortune is based on the book by von 
bulows appeal lawyer alan dershowitz von bulows 1982 conviction 
in rhode island on two counts of assault with intent to kill his 
wife with an injection of insulin was overturned after an appeal 
and second trial in 1985 
i think claus is actually much more a victim of that trial 
than sunny irons told fame magazine in its september issue 
they claim sunny was the victim and that her life was opened up 
for public scrutiny well so was claus von bulows and hes alive 
sunny at least is in a coma 
irons said the film costarring glenn close would keep people 
arguing about von bulows guilt or innocence

of conyers ga robert kirchner 36 of highland ranch colo and 
joseph balzer 35 of antioch tenn 
the felony charge carries a maximum 15 years in prison and 
250000 fine sentencing will not be decided until authorities 
complete a presentence investigation 
i came into this expecting the worst in that sense i had no 
surprise said prouse after the verdicts were announced in his 
defense he had argued that he was an alcoholic and thus had a 
higher tolerance for alcohol than most people his lawyer said he 
would appeal 
the three were arrested march 8 after flying a boeing 727 from 
fargo nd to the twin cities the plane carrying 91 passengers 
landed safely 
witnesses said they consumed numerous drinks at a bar several 
hours before the early morning flight 
in tests about two hours after the plane arrived at 
minneapolisst paul international airport kirchner showed a 
bloodalcohol concentration of 006 percent balzer showed 008 
percent and prouse 013 percent 
prouse was the captain on the flight kirchner the first officer 
and balzer the flight engineer 
the pilots had been drinking the night before at a lounge in 
moorhead and a customer reported them to the federal aviation 
administration according to undisputed trial testimony 
according to bills from the bar introduced as evidence prouse 
ordered 15 rum and colas while kirchner and balzer shared seven 
pitchers of beer over about six hours 
an faa official came to the airport but the plane left while he 
was telephoning a supervisor to see what to do another faa 
official made a citizens arrest when the plane landed at 
minneapolisst paul international airport 
defense lawyers argued that the apparently smooth operation of 
the 40minute flight showed that the pilots were not impaired by 
alcohol 
but assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega questioned 
whether the pilots could have handled an emergency if one had 
developed 
the law does not require that we have to wait for a tragedy to 
happen before we find someone guilty she told the jury 
northwest fired the pilots for violating the companys 12hour 
prohibition against drinking before flying and the faa revoked 
their licenses the faa prohibits flying within eight hours of 
drinking and prohibits pilots from flying with bloodalcohol 
concentrations of 004 percent or more 
the trial opened july 25 and jurors got the case on thursday 
the federal law providing criminal penalties for operation of a 
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol or drugs was 
adopted in 1986 and amended in 1988 besides planes the law 
applies to commercial boats trains and passengercarrying buses 
prior to enactment of the law pilots were covered only by faa 
regulations there were no federal criminal penalties for flying 
while intoxicated 
the law states that an individual with a bloodalcohol content 
of 010 percent or more shall be presumed to be under the influence 
of alcohol but it does not state flatly that that percentage makes 
a person automatically guilty 
us district judge james rosenbaum told jurors that they had to 
decide whether a defendant is so affected by an alcoholic 
beverage that the person does not possess that clearness of 
intellect and control of himself as he otherwise would

monday eldrin bell a flamboyant cop with a reputation for 
cracking heads 
in atlanta no 1 in the fbis bigcity crime statistics two 
years running bells appointment by mayor maynard jackson is a 
popular one 
let the word go forth bell said at a news conference 
announcing his appointment lawlessness and drug trafficking and 
gangs are not welcome in atlanta atlanta will not tolerate this 
kind of lawlessness 
jackson said bell has a well deserved reputation as a tough 
cop and is exactly what the doctor ordered 
we need someone who is going to kick butts said city 
council president marvin arrington 
arrington took the unusual step of announcing that the city 
council saw no need for confirmation hearings 
bell who succeeds the retiring chief morris redding is slated 
to be the citys most powerful police chief in nearly 20 years the 
position of public safety commissioner installed over the police 
and fire chiefs in 1974 was eliminated by jackson this year

in 1979 he was busted to major during an investigation of 
police protection for gamblers at a fairgrounds where bell worked 
security no charges were filed and he was reinstated 
in 1985 he was demoted to lieutenant after he was among the 
patrons at a swank italian restaurant where the invited guests were 
targets of an fbi drugtheft sting it turned out that bell hadnt 
been invited and wasnt a target of the fbi 
despite the controversy bell has made a name for himself as a 
takecharge cop he once reportedly picked up a billy club phoned 
for an ambulance entered a crowded bar and fought seven suspects 
into submission he was investigated in 1984 for pistolwhipping a 
motorist he had stopped but a civilian panel a police board and a 
federal judge later cleared him of using excessive force 
as commander of the citys crimeridden zone 3 he was known for 
patrolling streets himself in the middle of the night and for 
popping in unannounced at headquarters to make sure the night shift 
was answering calls promptly 
he takes over a police department that by many accounts has its 
hands full atlanta reported 210 serious crimes for each 1000 
residents in 1989 worst among the nations cities of 300000 or 
more according to the fbi it was the second straight year the 
city had the dubious distinction

injunction monday against construction of a voice of america relay 
station planned for the southern arava desert 
the injunction was requested by the nature preservation society 
which contends that the station could interfere with bird migration

construction after us ambassador william brown sent a note to 
communications minister rafael pinhasi stressing the importance 
washington attaches to the project

the persian gulf crisis has frayed 
nerves strained alliances and caused gnawing worries about the 
future it has also spawned a lot of jokes about saddam hussein 
the iraqi leader who started it all 
the humor helps take the edge off the fear 
in a bahrain cafe an egyptian pulled up a chair and made the 
habitual gestures of looking left and right to make sure no secret 
police were around 
then he poked fun at the iraqi presidents reputation for 
ruthlessness 
the other night saddam reprimanded his son for his poor 
english he asked if the boy neaded a private tutor and the boy 
named one he began 
saddam picked up the phone and issued the order bring along 
that english language teacher ibrahim ramadan ten hours later 
saddam phoned again and yelled where is that teacher i ordered 
you to get him 
the intelligence chief replied we did mr president the 
man confessed and we executed him 
large numbers of egyptians work in the persian gulf region 
drawn by its oil wealth the crisis sparked by saddams aug 2 
conquest of kuwait has given them a chance to indulge in a favorite 
pastime making acid jokes about petty tyrants 
their gibes at saddam circulate fast in the banking and business 
center of bahrain an island state of 400000 people 
for the egyptians in the region the jokes can help them forget 
their own countrys risky role in the crisis 
their president hosni mubarak led arab efforts to settle the 
crisis without outside intervention when saddam spurned his 
efforts mubarak sent troops to join the multinational force 
arrayed against iraq in saudi arabia 
saddam who took power in 1979 rules iraq with an iron hand 
with a powerful security apparatus to keep his citizens in check 
the 54yearold leader is also at the center of a pervasive 
personality cult iraqi newspapers television and radio constantly 
sing his praises even childrens nursery rhymes hail saddam 
in the small oilrich states of the gulf states not so 
different from kuwait saddam is also looming large these days 
cafe patrons have stopped playing backgammon and dominoes 
instead they huddle around transistor radios and listen to 
newscasts smoking their water pipes and sipping heavy desert 
coffee 
the egyptian cafegoer bent over a group of arabs and said in a 
serious tone have you heard the latest his audience tensed 
up waiting to hear about a fresh political or military development 
in the crisis 
the un delegates from egypt sudan and iraq were asked what 
was their opinion about eating meat said the storyteller the 
egyptian asked whats meat the sudanese asked whats eating 
and the iraqi asked what is opinion 
there was a burst of laughter prompting others to walk up and 
demand a repeat 
no repeats said the egyptian a joke is good only at the first 
hearing 
please sit down ill buy you a cup of tea an arab in a 
flowing dishdasha gown and kaffiyeh headgear entreated him lets 
have more

thousands of people with heart problems might 
no longer qualify for federal disability pay under a bush 
administration proposal to expand the use of a controversial 
exercise test 
sen john heinz rpa and new york state officials contend the 
tests which require pedaling a bicycle or walking on a treadmill 
could be unfairly used to exclude deserving applicants 
there can be no question that in this day of mammoth federal 
deficits even minimal savings are appreciated heinz said but 
to create savings by distorting congressional intent is 
unacceptable and a blatant disregard for the public interest 
the government estimates it will save 30 million in the plans 
first year and 220 million a year by 1995 plans for the testing 
program are still being finalized and would be subject to public 
comment 
the social security administration receives 195000 disability 
applications a year based on heart problems if the proposal went 
into effect the agency said cardiovascular benefits would drop as 
much as 5 percent and thousands of people would lose eligibility if 
the tests showed the applicants werent sufficiently disabled 
ssa already uses the procedure in many cases to gauge the 
severity of heart disorders but the proposed regulations would 
require a treadmill test for every disability benefit applicant 
with heart disease who could safely undergo one 
under the proposal applicants would qualify for social security 
disability payments averaging 560 a month only if the ailment is 
deemed serious enough to prevent them from working 
heinz ranking republican on the special committee on aging 
told ssa in a letter last month that the proposal violated 
individuals rights to have their cases fully heard 
new york attorney general robert abrams said in a prepared 
statement he was concerned that the federal government will 
continue to place predominant emphasis on the treadmill test in the 
face of other reliable medical evidence 
the test would be the primary though not exclusive basis 
for evaluating whether people with heart problems can work ssa 
commissioner gwendolyn king said in a february memorandum to health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan 
ssa wants the change despite a federal appeals court ruling in 
june that upheld a new york federal court ruling forbidding the 
agency from denying benefits based solely on the treadmill test 
when other evidence was available 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals said the test often fails 
to detect one of the most common cardiovascular disorders known as 
ischemia evidence showed that the treadmill test resulted in 
misdiagnosis of ischemic heart disease more than onethird of the 
time the court said 
an individual who does not show signs of heart disease during 
a treadmill test may still be severely disabled from ischemia 
the court said false assessments may occur because treadmill 
testing does not consider the full range of stresses and exertions 
that arise at the workplace or in daily living 
more than 5 million americans have the disorder which accounts 
for 60 percent of all heart ailments and is characterized by 
narrowing of the arteries and chest pain 
the administration may ask the court to reconsider said ssa 
spokesman phil gambino 
we disagree with the courts decision because we believe that 
even currently we wont use the test in exclusion of other medical 
evidence gambino said in an interview last week 
people already receiving benefits would be affected only if a 
treadmill test demonstrated that their condition had improved since 
their initial claim

psychology pioneer bf skinner applied his 
theories of behavior modification to his own life a friend 
recalled monday as tributes poured in for the man who died last 
weekend 
skinner invented a reward system for himself to speed his 
learning of french grammar said ted blau he would study the verbs 
on an exercise treadmill and give himself a break when he got 
something right 
fred was never a man to let things go to waste said blau 
blau a clinical psychologist in tampa fla became friends with 
skinner after meeting him in 1973 
skinner the father of behavioral psychology and a professor 
emeritus at harvard university died saturday at mount auburn 
hospital in cambridge after battling leukemia he was 86 
his theories bore the cold clinical edge of laboratory tests 
but friends and colleagues remembered him as a warm and gentle man 
who believed that human beings are just another organism shaped by 
their environment 
critics say many of skinners ideas were inhumane but 
supporters point out that he left his mark on treatment methods to 
improve the lives of the mentally ill drug addicts and others 
his death elicited emotional responses from friends and 
supporters 
i was kind of teary all day yesterday said jack michael 
who teaches psychology at western michigan university its just 
kind of the end of a period that was important to all of us 
skinner experimented with pigeons and rats to show that systems 
of rewards and punishment could shape animal behavior he taught 
pigeons to play ping pong by reinforcing behavior patterns 
the practical application of skinners theories can be seen in 
popular programs to help people lose weight stop smoking and 
toilet train children 
skinner for many of us is a person of the same status who has 
the same impact on the understanding of behavior that darwin had in 
the area of biology or that newton had in the area of physics 
michael said 
charles darwin postulated the modern theory of evolution and 
sir isaac newton formulated the laws of gravity and motion 
fred keller 91 a psychologist retired from columbia 
university first met skinner in 1928 when they were graduate 
students at harvard 
i first thought he was just a brilliant student whom i 
liked said keller who lives in chapel hill nc 
he was widely read keller said he was clearly a highly 
intellectual and highly intelligent young man and that was 
apparent from the first i think all of his classmates at harvard 
recognized that he was an outstanding scientist 
william mckeachie professor of psychology at university of 
michigan said he exchanged many letters with skinner and sharply 
disagreed with his views 
but we were friends mckeachie said he asked me to review 
one of his last manuscripts 
skinners theories have had a major effect on education and the 
running of mental hospitals and prisons he said 
skinner developed token economies in which people in 
institutions could earn rewards by good behavior and meeting goals 
teachers learned to pay more attention to classroom techniques 
which could affect how students behave and learn 
skinner was honored one week ago for his lifetime of achievement 
by the american psychological association at their convention in 
boston 
he was nominated many times to be president of the apa but 
turned it down said blau a former apa president 
he did not believe that psychologists serious about their work 
should be distracted by political ins and outs

president bush on monday made official what the rev edwin davis 
and his wife irene have sensed for nearly three weeks their 
daughter and thousands of other americans are hostages 
what happens if theres a shooting war asked the retired 
minister from koran la id like to be over there with them 
hold my daughters hand 
but the 68yearold diabetic cant join the military soldier 
boys digging in for a long persian gulf standoff neither can he 
do anything to drive away the images haunting him and families 
around the nation 
at night while he tries to rest davis feels the heat he 
imagines his daughter kuwaiti soninlaw and their two teenage 
children feel 
he hears the helicopters that buzzed in the background the last 
time she called home the night iraqi troops rumbled into kuwait 
since the aug 2 invasion scant news has reached the relatives 
of about 3000 americans caught in iraqs tightening grip state 
department officials have contacted some us families others are 
still awaiting word 
jean pryor is among the luckier relatives through a circuitous 
route a message from her daughter in kuwait made it home to 
pelham ala it said simply im fine i dont think im in 
danger they have moved me from the city to another province 
pryor who isnt sure who they are said the brief 
reassurance came at just the right time was an answer to the 
prayers that have gone out but that message is now nearly a week 
old tensions have escalated 
iraqs official news agency said monday that western detainees 
had been moved to vital military targets apparently to be used as 
human shields against a potential american attack the government 
also has warned that those who hide foreigners will face the 
severest punishment 
we have been reluctant to use the term hostage bush told 
the veterans of foreign wars in baltimore 
but when saddam hussein specifically offers to trade the 
freedom of those citizens of many nations he holds against their 
will in return for concessions there can be little doubt that 
they are in fact hostages 
thats what ive said for two weeks said marjorie 
walterscheid of jacksboro texas her husband rainard 52 is 
among a group of 35 us citizens transferred from a baghdad hotel 
to an undisclosed location ive felt all the time they were 
hostages 
semantics mean little to scott gerard of new harmony ind all 
he knows is that his sisterinlaw could lose her baby 
joan khaja who is seven months pregant suffered complications 
before she traveled to kuwait in late july to visit her husbands 
relatives now family members fear her body may not tolerate the 
dueling stresses of 100degree desert heat and chilling uncertainty 
it seems like officials have been so cautious not to use the 
term hostage all along gerard said but i dont think it 
makes any difference at all 
i dont think theres anything we can do but hope that 
there wont be another war that our loved ones wont die in 
vain said palma sharpan whose nephew worked for american 
telephone amp telegraph co in kuwait for the past 15 years 
the prospect of war holds anxious relatives hostage in a 
windowless room at the state department in washington dc 
consular officers take about 4000 calls a day from people trying 
to locate missing family members 
we live by the tv now said lynda parker of vidor texas 
i live with a telephone in one hand and the remote control in the 
other her husband bobby 49 is a kuwait petroleum co worker 
missing since the invasion 
its with me all the time said pryor whose daughter has 
had two children since she moved from alabama to kuwait three years 
ago 
i get up very early in the mornings so that by the time the 
news goes off at night my body goes to sleep she said monday 
but my heart is still awake it never sleeps

a man convicted in the fatal shootings of 
two black joggers 10 years ago monday has finally admitted his 
guilt 
joseph paul franklin an avowed racist admitted in a television 
interview he killed the two men in a city park aug 20 1980 
ted fields 20 and david martin 18 were felled in a sniper 
attack as they ran with two white girls the gunman was hidden in a 
field nearby 
in an interview with kutv from the federal prison in marion 
ill franklin initially refused to answer questions about the 
murders 
an hour into the interview which was broadcast sunday night 
franklin was asked again about the murders the answer is yes i 
wont discuss it any further other than to say yes he said 
pressed to supply the one answer sought by martins mother 
franklin added a short time later just for her just to answer 
her question ill say that it was just because they were race 
mixing had they not been race mixing you know it would have been 
a totally different story 
franklin 39 a drifter from mobile ala and a past member of 
the ku klux klan and american nazi party is serving four life 
terms for the slayings of martin and fields two state murder 
convictions and two federal convictions for violating the victims 
civil rights

iran on monday said it will abide by un 
sanctions against iraq despite the newly established peace between 
the two neighboring persian gulf states 
the official islamic republic news agency in a report monitored 
in nicosia said iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
informed un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of the 
decision in a letter sent monday 
iran as a member of the united nations will honor resolution 
661 issued by the un security council within the capacities 
stipulated by the un charter irna quoted velayati as telling 
the un chief 
iraqi president saddam hussein announced last week that he had 
accepted irans terms for a settlement of the decadeold conflict 
pacifying his eastern neighbor as his confrontation escalated with 
usled forces in saudi arabia and the gulf region 
he began withdrawing troops from occupied iranian territories on 
friday and the two sides have since exchanged thousands of 
prisoners captured in the 198088 war 
saddams peace initiative raised speculation iran would violate 
the mandatory sanctions called by the un security council after 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and the subsequent annexation 
of the small gulf emirate 
the foreign ministers of turkey and pakistan both staunch 
allies of the west traveled to iran last weekend seeking 
commitment from velayati to the sanctions 
iran has condemned the invasion and called for an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait but it said it was equally opposed to the 
deployment of usled multinational forces in saudi arabia 
it called for the withdrawal of these forces which assembled in 
the kingdom to thwart a possible iraqi attack from the north 
saying developments in kuwait were best solved by countries of the 
region

at odds with president bush and half the 
arab world king hussein is persevering in his attempts to be a 
peacemaker in the persian gulf but his position is precarious 
since hussein assumed the throne in 1952 at age 16 he has 
managed to endure despite being at the vortex of the political 
upheavals that have plagued the middle east but his support for 
iraqs president following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait has 
left hussein vulnerable 
the crisis threatens jordans very social and political 
stability leading economist fahed fanek wrote in the 
englishlanguage jordan times newspaper on sunday 
the king has refused to join egypt syria and other arab states 
that have sent troops even if they are primarily token 
contingents to join the western buildup in saudi arabia against 
iraq 
hussein says he cannot participate if he is to pursue his 
efforts for a settlement within an arab context without outside 
intervention 
western diplomats in amman said hussein has shown a genuine 
desire to avert a potentially catastrophic military showdown in the 
gulf 
but if he joins the forces against iraqs president saddam 
hussein he risks the wrath of his powerful neighbor he also faces 
an internal threat jordans 3 million people have rallied behind 
saddam whom many arabs consider the only leader willing to stand 
up to israel and the united states 
more than 100000 jordanians have registered as volunteers to 
fight for iraq if war breaks out according to the jordanian 
committee for the support of iraq 
but if hussein supports the iraqi leader he is certain to face 
the jewish states military might and the revulsion of the 
international community 
dan shueftan a researcher at israels hebrew university said 
the king is walking between the devil and the deep blue sea 
another israeli ron benishai military commentator for the 
daily yediot ahronot justified husseins concern over israeli 
intentions 
theyre worried about a possible israeli preemptive strike 
he said 
jordan is saddams main avenue for confronting israel on the 
ground israels hardline government has warned it will attack if 
the iraqis enter jordan 
hussein has expressed discouragement over what he sees as the 
failure of the west especially the united states to get israel to 
the negotiating table 
he told jordanian newspaper editors over the weekend jordan 
will pursue its efforts with all its powers on the arab and 
international level to deescalate the gulf crisis 
bush said after meeting with hussein on thursday in 
kennebunkport maine that he had not come away with any feeling 
of hope that iraq will withdraw from kuwait despite intensifying 
international pressure 
the king painted an equally grim picture 
this is the most crucial stage ever in arab history he told 
the editors 
the arabs could either survive with a place under the sun 
among other nations or god forbid live in darkness losing 
everything they have he warned 
hussein has declared he still recognizes sheik jaber alahmed al 
sabah the emir of kuwait overthrown by saddams invasion he has 
said he will abide by the un economic sanctions imposed against 
iraq to force its withdrawal from kuwait 
but he has not implemented them jordans economy burdened with 
an 8 billion debt is heavily dependent on trade with iraq nearly 
all its oil comes from there 
jordans red sea port of aqaba remains baghdads economic 
lifeline 
the european community has discussed compensating jordan for 
joining the blockade of iraq 
but fanek the economist said all the compensation in the 
world would not make up for the farreaching economic and 
political losses jordan would suffer which threaten not only the 
national income but also national security

gubernatorial nomination in tuesdays primary election and the 
winner most likely will face democratic gov mike sullivan 
the gop candidates are mary mead daughter of former gov and 
us sen cliff hansen and state rep nyla murphy 
mead a teton county rancher and murphy a 12year state 
representative from casper seemed to agree on issues more often 
than not during the primary campaign both support abortion rights 
oppose other states dumping garbage in wyoming and favor the death 
penalty 
where they differ is on meads call for a cut in minerals taxes 
to spur exploration murphy believes the current tax system is 
adequate and that the economy will improve under the states 
diversification efforts 
sullivan is seeking his second term his opponent for the 
democratic nomination is ron suds clingman a rock springs 
motorcycle repairman who believes his stances on lowering the 
drinking age back to 18 legalizing gambling and cutting the 
salaries of public officials are popular 
us sen alan simpson the senate minority whip is seeking a 
third term and us rep craig thomas is pursuing his first full 
term in office 
simpson faces two political unknowns in the gop primary while 
six unheralded democrats are seeking their partys nomination for 
the seat 
thomas was appointed to fill dick cheneys unexpired term in 
office when he was appointed defense secretary last year thomas is 
unopposed in the primary as is his democratic opponent pete

the white house said anew monday that federal 
programs could face more than 105 billion in spending cuts barring 
deficitreduction action by the end of the fiscal year president 
bush appealed for cooperation from democrats because our country 
is at stake 
bushs office of management and budget released its new report 
under a timetable mandated by the deficitfighting grammrudman 
law the reductions the report described are preliminary now but 
both military and civilian programs could face cuts in excess of 40 
percent on oct 1 unless bush and congress reach a budget agreement 
before then 
however one of the few things the budget negotiators have 
agreed upon is that they cant agree on 105 billion in either 
spending cuts or new taxes to meet the grammrudman goal theyve 
set their sights on about 50 billion in deficit reduction next 
year with the assumption that if they can strike that deal they 
can then change the law to prevent any deeper cutbacks 
the president met with his budget negotiators monday in 
preparation for the resumption of the bipartisan talks early next 
month 
later in comments at a republican fundraising gathering in 
rhode island and on his plane on the way there bush said that 
cooperation is still possible with the democrats and that he 
has been pleased with the way some democratic leaders have 
approached the problem 
there has been some good faith effort in terms of 
negotiations but it is essential now when the congress comes back 
that this cooperation be renewed because our country is at 
stake 
in a more partisan attack bush said of bills under 
consideration in the democraticcontrolled congress i will veto 
every single spending bill that busts the budget were in that 
tough a shape so they can mark it down and put it in the bank 
the remark drew loud applause from the gop audience 
in earlier comments in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars 
in baltimore he appealed anew for congress not to cut military 
spending he cited the persian gulf situation as an example of a 
need to retain military readiness despite reduced tensions in 
eastern europe 
the budget office report followed the lines of predictions it 
made last month when the administration released its midyear 
economic review 
under grammrudman the federal deficit must be reduced to 64 
billion for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 or automatic 
acrosstheboard spending cuts are ordered the administration 
estimates that the deficit will exceed the grammrudman limit by 
1057 billion and come that close only if the 50 billion or more 
needed for the savings and loan bailout isnt counted 
social security and other entitlement programs are exempt from 
the cutbacks and bush has exercised his option of exempting 
military payrolls also 
according to the omb calculations the remaining military and 
domestic programs would likely face cutbacks of 436 percent and 
407 percent respectively 
for many agencies the only way to achieve such reductions would 
be to lay off workers cut off benefit programs or virtually close 
down 
our preferred course remains the negotiation of a budget 
summit agreement that provides for continued economic growth and 
responsible deficit reduction said omb director richard darman 
in his letter accompanying the report 
if not the cuts will go into effect as required by law 
he said

the three teenagers signed written statements and gave 
videotaped statements to police and prosecutors as in the first 
trial the statements appear to be the prosecutions crucial

col moammar gadhafi on monday criticized 
both iraq and the united states for provocative actions in the 
mideast and threatened to withdraw libya from the united nations 
the libyan leader also urged the un security council to pass a 
resolution calling for military measures against iraq which 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 the united nations has backed the use of 
economic sanctions in its effort to get iraq to withdraw occupation 
forces from kuwait 
at a news conference in the babaziziya barracks outside the 
capital of tripoli gadhafi said he opposed iraqs holding of 
foreigners including americans and british citizens as hostages 
we are against the use of hostages as bargaining chips this is 
our fixed priciple 
gadhafis news conference attended by about 150 news people 
was conducted in a tentlike structure lined with bright green red 
and white canvas the libyan leader was surrounded by reporters 
shouting questions at him 
when at one point the translator said the united states 
instead of the un gadhafi said hes right now there is 
no difference between the united states and the united nations 
he also said the un security council has so far taken steps 
within the un charter recommending the international community 
impose economic sanctions on iraq but the united states has 
ignored this resolution 
the united states which has decided to stop vessels suspected 
of carrying goods to iraq has stationed warships in and around the 
persian gulf and in the red sea 
the un security council must now condemn the united states 
and its allies the same way it has condemned iraq gadhafi said 
he condemned iraq for its invasion of kuwait and the military 
response by the united states saying unless the un security 
council moves quickly i am thinking of withdrawing from the un 
and my nation will think of that too 
asked if he had any time frame in mind for such a move gadhafi 
only said if the united nations cannot keep peace there is no 
point in maintaining membership 
the libyan leader dressed in a gray suit and a blackandwhite 
striped shirt also said his country would be ready to send troops 
if it was asked to in order to ensure an economic blockade of iraq 
he did not elaborate 
asked if he could use his influence with iraqi president saddam 
hussein gadhafi said he had been unable to contact him because 
communications with iraq remain cut 
libya called news agencies and networks a day earlier to 
announce gadhafis news conference and arranged for charter flights 
to carry the press to tripoli

violated federal safety standards 
the suits against toys r us and six other companies charge that 
the toys are unsafe because they contain excessive amounts of lead 
paint or have small parts that could choke small children 
the agencies said they were unaware of any injuries or deaths 
resulting from the toys some of which were seized from store 
shelves by government investigators 
in a statement attorney general dick thornburgh called the 
lawsuits an important step toward preventing even a single 
dangerous toy from reaching innocent children 
however michael goldstein executive vice president of toys r 
us said the suit is without merit our safety record is 
excellent 
we believe we will prevail in the legal action and we believe 
its a waste of the taxpayers money said goldstein who was 
named as a defendant in the suit against toys r us 
the lawsuits seek injunctions barring the companies from 
importing or selling the toys that contain too much lead paint or 
are considered unsafe for children under age three 
the lawsuits described a variety of rattles and toy airplanes or 
stuffed animals that violated the safety regulations many of the 
toys cited were labeled for use by children over age three but the 
cpsc contended in court papers that the items were in fact 
intended to be used by small children who could choke on small 
parts 
cpsc spokesman dan rumelt said the toys were mostly imported 
from taiwan but also were made in hong kong china and south korea 
besides toys r us which is headquartered in paramus nj the 
government also sued child world inc of avon mass lionel 
leisure inc of philadelphia value merchants inc of milwaukee 
illco toy company usa inc of new york beachcombers 
international inc of fort meyers fla and division sales inc of 
itasca ill chief executives of the companies were also named as 
defendants in the civil suits 
the complaints also named the chief executives of the companies 
as defendants in the civil suits the court papers said each of the 
companies had been previously notified that the toys violated 
safety regulations 
some of the toys have been recalled by distributors the cpsc 
said 
a woman who answered the telephone at lionel leisure declined to 
comment saying she was unaware of the lawsuit 
until we receive legal service as far as were concerned we 
havent been sued by anybody said the woman who refused to 
identify herself 
an official of division sales who also refused to identify 
himself declined to comment saying he didnt know anything 
about it 
mike mervis a spokesman for value merchants said the company 
had recalled all nine items cpsc cited as unsafe value merchants 
purchased the items thinking they met government standards but 
the product bought and the product that was shipped may have been 
different things he said 
value merchants is continuing to negotiate with the government 
to reach a consent decree to settle the case mervis said but the 
spokesman blamed inadequate inspection of foreign goods by the us 
customs service for the recurring problem 
there is no foolproof way to control this without much 
stronger federal intervention and some means of controlling the 
inspection process in factories overseas he said

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher proposed monday that the official granting of 
international approval to german unity be moved up a month to 
october 
current plans call for the results of talks on international 
aspects of german unification to be presented to a november meeting 
in paris of the 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe csce 
member nations of the csce include the united states canada 
the soviet union and all european countries except for albania 
the four world war ii allies and the two germanys have reached 
basic agreement on how to iron out international complexities of 
german unity 
probably the greatest obstacle was moscows insistence that a 
united germany cannot be a nato member the soviets have since 
reversed their position in an agreement that will allow red army 
troops to remain in what is now east germany during a transition 
phase 
the six nations that were involved in those talks the united 
states britain france the soviet union and the two germanys 
are working on a final document that will cover the results of the 
negotiations 
genscher said monday that document should be presented to a 
meeting of csce foreign ministers in new york city on oct 12 
rather than at the paris gathering 
during the early stages of the sixnation talks it looked like 
german unity would not happen before the end of the year 
but the unification process has sped up quickly and the merger 
now looks likely to occur oct 14 at latest

india placed its troops on alert across 
its northern border with pakistan on monday after clashes were 
reported with pakistani troops in a remote area of the disputed 
kashmir territory 
describing the clashes as a major border incident united 
news of india said that according to unconfirmed reports at least 
10 pakistani soldiers were killed and five wounded in the clashes 
there was no official confirmation on casualties 
it is very difficult to say if there were casualties we are 
however checking said an indian government spokesman ram mohan 
rao 
the clashes reportedly occurred in the kupwara sector of the 
disputed frontier about 60 miles northeast of the srinagar the 
capital of indias jammukashmir state 
earlier pakistani troops fired heavy artillery with explosive 
and incendiary shells at indian border posts in jammukashmir 
state rao said 
exchange of small arms fire is a frequent occurrence on the 
border but use of heavy artillery and incendiary ammunition is 
something new rao said 
in islamabad a pakistani defense ministry spokesman denied the 
reported incident 
there is absolutely no truth in the report of pakistanis 
firing at indian troops said the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but in new delhi an indian defense ministry official 
requesting anonymity said all troops were put on alert along the 
border after the incident 
indian defense officials in srinagar called the incident 
serious the officials who also asked not to be identified 
said some of the pakistani shells landed a halfmile inside indian 
territory 
rao said the indian government was waiting to receive more 
details about the border incident 
probably pakistan wants to make a little more noise but we 
have taken appropriate defensive measures rao said he refused 
to elaborate on the measures 
a week ago pakistan accused indian troops of using heavy 
artillery antitank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture a 
border outpost in pakistancontrolled kashmir at the time india 
denied the claim 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since gaining 
independence from britain in 1947 two of the wars were fought over 
kashmir a former principality claimed by both countries 
the present border is a ceasefire line drawn in 1972 that 
separates jammukashmir indias only moslemmajority state from 
pakistans azad free kashmir region 
in another sign of escalating tension the prime minister of 
pakistanheld azad kashmir on monday ordered mandatory military 
training for all males 
india wants to attack responsibility for the whole of the 
kashmir nation is on my shoulders the prime minister mumtaz 
rathore told about 3000 cheering supporters in the azad kashmir 
capital of muzzaffarabad 
from this day onward my mission will be the liberation of 
kashmir he said 
a senior aide to rathore requesting anonymity said military 
training would also be given to moslem militants spearheading the 
secessionist uprising in indias jammukashmir state 
the aide said rathore sought no prior approval from the national 
governmet in islamabad before announcing the compulsory military 
training 
pakistanheld azad kashmir is relatively autonomous but the 
federal government is responsible for the regions defense 
diplomacy and finances 
analysts say rathores plans to provide military training for 
kashmiris could cause a confrontation with the new rightwing 
government that succeeded ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
india has accused pakistan of providing arms and training to 
moslem militants in jammukashmir pakistan an islamic state has 
denied the allegation but says it supports the kashmiri peoples 
right to selfdetermination 
at least 1034 people have been killed in jammukashmir since 
new delhi launched a crackdown on the moslem secessionist movement 
on jan 20 
in may both countries massed their armies along the ceasefire 
line in kashmir as war fears escalated 
the crisis was averted largely due to diplomatic intervention by 
the united states and the soviet union

president bush signed a trade bill monday 
restricting state and federal log exports in an effort to save 
thousands of timber jobs affected by automation and federal 
protection of the northern spotted owl 
bush said there was no doubt that high levels of export of 
unprocessed timber have contributed to the decline in habitat 
that caused the northern spotted owl to be listed as threatened 
while i am supporting this provision because it assists in the 
preservation of critical habitat i also note that it will ease the 
economic transition in areas affected by the listing of the spotted 
owl bush said 
the log measure is intended to preserve the pacific northwests 
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough 
oldgrowth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction 
the bill makes permanent what had been a yeartoyear ban on the 
export of raw logs from federal land and imposes a new ban on state 
lands in california and oregon exports from stateowned land in 
washington would be reduced but not halted 
log exports from privately owned lands would still be allowed 
but the timber industry generally would be prohibited from 
substituting them for logs from federal lands as a way to escape 
the ban 
the legislation passed by congress earlier this month also 
permanently extends the dutyfree status of 4 billion in imports 
from 24 caribbean and central american nations including nicaragua 
and panama 
americas security and prosperity depend in large measure on 
continued progress toward democracy and economic development in the 
caribbean basin bush said in a written statement 
the legislation did not expand the trade benefits to cover 
imports of textiles shoes sugar and methanol commodities that 
could threaten us farmers and jobs it did however expand the 
program to give duty free status to articles processed in caribbean 
countries from us materials and to certain leather products 
president reagans 1983 caribbean basin initiative was intended 
to lift the regions depressed economy through direct aid and an 
elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to spur 
exportoriented businesses 
critics say the initiative has failed to large degree because 
the direct governmenttogovernment aid fell victim to us budget 
deficits and drastically reduced imports of oil petroleum products 
and sugar from the region 
the log export prohibitions will have the biggest impact in 
washington oregon and northern california where dramatic harvest 
cutbacks are beginning to materialize in government plans for 
oldgrowth forests inhabited by the threatened owl 
our mills need the logs and oregon millworkers need the 
jobs said sen bob packwood rore who estimated the law will 
save 5000 to 7000 jobs in his state alone 
what weve done with this legislation is say we want to keep 
jobs at home instead of shipping them overseas said sen brock 
adams dwash 
the shift in us trade policy is due primarily to the plight of 
the owl said rep john miller rwash 
there are other factors but clearly the owl focused 
everybodys energy on this problem and the owl spurred the state 
delegations and the administration to look at all sorts of options 
for addressing the timber shortage at the mills he said in a 
telephone interview

diplomatic license plates the police also said the officer was 
aiming at the lower right side of the van when he fired but hit 
the rear windshield instead because the vehicle was going downhill

a top federal health official on monday 
disputed a congressional report that concluded the reagan white 
house obstructed a government study of vietnam veterans exposed to 
agent orange 
dr james mason assistant secretary for health in the 
department of health and human services said the study was 
canceled for scientific reasons not pressure from the white house 
he issued a fourpage statement detailing what he said were 
factual errors in the aug 9 report by the house government 
operations committee 
the bias is clear mason said of the report 
the study said the white house ordered the study canceled after 
the federal centers for disease control said it was scientifically 
impossible to use military records to identify veterans who had 
been exposed to the defoliant 
the committee said the cdc then headed by mason did not 
document that exposure could not be assessed and disregarded 
alternate methods of measuring exposure 
mason said there was no white house or any other 
interference in any of the initial studies conducted to determine 
feasibility of exposure assessments white house officials were not 
privy to the results of these studies before they were released 
publicly he said 
he also said the studies found no accurate way to assess 
exposure 
each time a new method was proposed testing showed it not to 
be accurate mason said it was not possible to differentiate 
between the exposed and the nonexposed veterans based on military 
records 
agent orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during 
the vietnam war veterans groups claim that exposure to agent 
orange has been linked to 19 cancers and other health problems 
including birth defects

an iraqi freighter is heading to jordan with 17 
armored bridgelayers that enable tanks to cross difficult terrain 
janes defense weekly reported monday night 
janes publisher paul beaver said it was a clear indication the 
iraqis were trying to obtain offensive military equipment by 
gaining access to the east german blg60 tracked vehicles the 
vehicles have scissorlike bridges that are capable of spanning a 
gap of 66 feet 
iraq received seven in a deal last year with the former 
communist east german regime the magazine said 
seventeen more were reported to have left the polish harbor of 
gdynia on july 31 en route for the jordanian port of aqaba after 
making several other stops the magazine said 
the new east german regime only became aware of the latest 
delivery aug 10 and requested the four allied powers the united 
states britain france and the soviet union to stop the vessel 
according to the report 
its whereabouts are not known janes said 
the foreign office said monday night it was aware of the vessel 
the ministry of defense said it would take any necessary action to 
enforce the united nations embargo against iraq 
janes also reported that the us government may restrict 
foreign sales of the bell 206 longranger helicopter because of 
concern it could be modified as a helicopter gunship and sold to 
iraq 
a modification program on the bell 206 is being funded by 
chiles cardoen industries which has a long history of selling 
arms to iraq janes said 
the chilean company which would buy and modify used aircraft 
is trying to gain us federal aviation administration 
certification to operate the twocrew helicopter as a singlepilot 
aircraft it said 
us officials are concerned the aircraft will be delivered to 
baghdad configured as helicopter gunships and may add it to the 
us munitions list administered by the us state department the 
magazine said this would require all us owners to clear foreign 
sales 
us state department officials were quoted by the magazine as 
saying iraq seeks as many as 150200 modified longrangers from 
cardoen industries

president bush crossed a critical line monday 
in finally describing americans and other foreigners trapped in 
iraq and kuwait as hostages 
it may mean he is closer to sending some of the troops now 
massing in saudi arabia into iraq in a rescue operation or even an 
outright attack on baghdad 
or bush merely may have been acknowledging the obvious 
he held off for more than two weeks emphasizing diplomacy and 
appeals to iraqs saddam hussein to observe international norms 
hours before the president spoke to the veterans of foreign wars in 
baltimore his spokesman had told reporters concerning the term 
we would not use that word 
the plight of the foreigners seemed to worsen through the 
weekend there were threats to use them as human shields placed 
in strategic locations to deter us attack 
a handful of americans managed last week to cross the border to 
freedom but evidently none from kuwait over the weekend 
thirtyfive removed from a hotel in baghdad have not resurfaced at 
least a dozen possibly 14 others were taken from two hotels in 
kuwait city destination not certain 
so bush revised the speech prepared for him for the vfw national 
convention to inject that there can be little doubt whatever 
these innocent people are called they are indeed hostages and 
he warned iraq and everyone else not to underestimate us resolve 
the president took that decisive step after meeting with brent 
scowcroft his assistant for national security and with deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
with the assertion bush could be trying to establish a legal 
justification for an attack although it was not immediately clear 
that the status of the americans had changed under international 
law 
the president also may be preparing the american public 
psychologically for the support he needs to escalate from economic 
pressure on iraq to combat with grave risk to the lives of us 
troops and bomber crews 
but above all bushs description of the americans as hostages 
helps him develop a rationale for using force to try to rescue 
innocent us citizens who by no stretch of the imagination could 
be considered combatants 
saddams quickly rejected proposal to free the foreigners in 
exchange for a us military pullout from the persian gulf region 
set political conditions for their freedom richard boucher a 
state department spokesman noted 
it dramatizes the circumstances under which these people are 
being held boucher said 
last friday in a subtle shift boucher said he did not want to 
speculate about whether the americans might be described as 
hostages and then over the weekend thomas pickering the us 
envoy to the united nations called them hostages a description 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater challenged 
until the situation darkened us officials insisted reporters 
should not use the term 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler repeatedly 
stressed the americans were not being held at gunpoint they were 
not being mistreated and efforts were under way to secure their 
departure frompiraq and kuwait 
from the days of the 19th century barbary pirates the united 
states and its leaders have rallied to the aid of americans 
detained abroad against their will but the risk of allout war 
dictates trying diplomacy first 
president jimmy carter exhausted all available means after 
iranian fundamentalists overran the us embassy in tehran in 1979 
and seized the embassy staff and marine guards he tried a military 
rescue operation that failed in a desert north of the capital but 
never pulled the trigger to fire on tehran 
the american television audience in the meantime was bombarded 
nightly with the message that the united states itself was being 
held hostage ronald reagan campaigning against carter 
capitalized on the frustrating situation and won the white house in 
1980 
the 52 remaining american hostages finally were released through 
carter administration diplomacy but they were not liberated until 
reagans inaugural and after 444 days of miserable detention 
reagan in his two terms did not succeed in freeing a number of 
other americans held hostage in lebanon by proiranian factions 
secret us arms shipments to iran may have been instrumental in 
the release of a couple but the other americans remained captive 
and at least two were murdered 
now it is bushs turn to grapple with hostageholders 
the iraq crisis looms as his toughest political challenge 
declaring the americans in iraq and kuwait to be hostages may 
expose him to a fate similar to carters he runs the risk of being 
branded a failure if the 530 or so in iraq and 2500 in kuwait are 
not freed soon 
direct military action to liberate them or at least to punish 
iraq could help or hurt the president depending on the results 
his delay in calling them hostages minimized the political risk 
for a while but monday bush crossed that line to an uncertain 
outcome

at least 12 americans possibly 14 were taken 
from hotels in kuwaits capital and moved to an undisclosed 
location the state department said monday 
us diplomats in kuwait and iraq protested the action but the 
whereabouts of the americans remain unknown said spokesman richard 
boucher other foreign nationals also were taken from hotels the 
department said 
the americans were staying at the hyatt regency and the kuwait 
international they are among an estimated 2500 americans in the 
persian gulf country overrun by iraqi forces three weeks ago 
president bush in a speech monday referred to the americans as 
hostages for the first time 
a us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
the 12 or 14 americans included men and women as well as at least 
one family he said he did not know if any children were among them 
they may be going to baghdad the official said thats 
something we presume 
but he said he didnt have any solid information 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened to use americans 
as a human shield in the event of a us military attack bush told 
the veterans of foreign wars convention in baltimore that the 
americans trapped in the two countries were hostages and warned 
iraq not to underestimate us resolve 
securing the safety of the 2500 americans in kuwait and another 
530 or so in iraq is the prime concern of the bush 
administration boucher said 
we continue to do everything we can to obtain the release of 
these people boucher said adding that the united states is 
telling family members that the prime concern of our people in 
baghdad and in kuwait has become the safety and welfare of 
americans 
another 35 americans who were taken earlier from kuwait to the 
rashid hotel in baghdad were removed last week boucher said they 
remain unaccounted for despite repeated us inquiries 
us diplomats in baghdad called again monday at the iraqi 
foreign ministry and again were barred from going to another hotel 
the meliamansour to see if the americans had been moved there 
boucher said the meliamansour is where british nationals were 
taken last week 
american diplomats in kuwait are in touch with as many 
americans as possible through visits by telephone and via voice 
of america and the british broadcasting co boucher said 
we continue to push for the release of all people held against 
their will he said 
despite reports americans have been leaving kuwait in small 
numbers the state department cant confirm that any escaped over 
the weekend boucher said 
meanwhile bush dismissed as unacceptable an iraqi demand that 
the us embassy in kuwait city be closed by friday 
as the situation for americans in the area worsened the state 
department said nonessential diplomats and dependents were leaving 
jordan which borders iraq the department says there are about 
5000 americans in jordan 4700 of them private citizens and the 
remainder us officials 
americans there were advised to consider leaving similar 
instructions were issued for yemen which lies far beyond iraq on 
the arabian sea 
i cant cite for you the specific security factors in each 
country that might have led to that determination boucher said

a courtroom became an arena of artistic debate 
monday over whether five sexually explicit photographs by robert 
mapplethorpe should be judged separately or as part of an entire 
175picture exhibit 
defense lawyers for the contemporary arts center and its 
director dennis barrie argued for dismissal of a misdemeanor 
charge of pandering obscenity he said the exhibition as a whole 
wasnt legally obscene 
both the director and the gallery were charged when they showed 
the photos by the late artist which previously had drawn the anger 
of us sen jesse helms and helped prompt congressional action to 
restrict funding of work deemed obscene 
in addition to that defense motion municipal judge david j 
albanese considered a prosecution request to consider just the five 
pictures identified in the indictment in judging whether obscenity 
laws were violated 
albanese did not rule on either request 
judith reisman a communications consultant who said she has 
studied sexually explicit photographs for the justice department 
and the american family association testified that individual 
photographs would have affected visitors 
defense lawyer h louis sirkin countered but i go in to see 
the exhibit as a whole dont i 
absolutely not absolutely not ms reisman said there 
are people who walked in and saw one picture and left 
martin friedman of the walker art center in minneapolis 
testified for the defense that every picture in the sixweek 
exhibit had to be considered as part of the entire show he noted 
that the contemporary arts centers contract to show the pictures 
required it to show all of them 
the whole purpose of an exhibition is to set up context 
friedman said an exhibition must be all the pictures you cant 
isolate some of the pictures and talk about the exhibition 
the judge took over the questioning at several points during the 
3hour hearing asking defense witnesses if sexually graphic 
pictures were required as part of a survey of the career of the 
late mapplethorpe 
the judge asked evan turner director of the cleveland museum of 
art is there some danger if the gallerys direction of the 
theme was just a vehicle for exhibiting erotic photographs for 
people who wanted to see erotic photographs 
i dont think any of the photographs in this exhibition fits 
that definition turner said 
the five photographs identified in one count of a twocount 
indictment against barrie and the gallery depict homoerotic acts 
they are difficult images but they are important to 
understanding the artists approach friedman said 
the judge earlier ordered barrie and the gallery to stand trial 
sept 24 on another charge of using children in material involving 
nudity one picture in the exhibition included a boy with his 
genitals exposed another showed a girl with her genitals exposed 
the charges of pandering obscenity and using children in 
material involving nudity each would carry a maximum penalty of six 
months in jail and a 1000 fine for barrie the gallery could be 
fined 5000 on each charge 
the mapplethorpe exhibition closed in cincinnati on may 26 it 
opened in boston on aug 2 provoking demonstrations for and 
against the institute for contemporary art which is displaying it 
authorities in boston have not filed criminal charges

britains sole frontline fighter 
squadron at dhahran in northeastern saudi arabia went on alert 
monday night for a possible palestinian terrorist attack according 
to a news report 
ian bruce of the glasgow herald said the warning was given after 
touchdown at king abdul aziz airbase of a royal air force vc10 
transport aircraft loaded with spare parts for the 12 tornado f3 
interceptors and chemical warfare suits for the ground support 
crews 
bruce gave no source for his information though thousands of 
palestinian workers live in saudi arabia 
charles miller of the domestic british news agency press 
association said the crew of the dc10 aircraft that took 
journalists into dhahran carefully examined the plane after 
receiving an intelligence warning about the possible attack by the 
palestine liberation organization 
miller did not specify the source of his information 
the plo was one of the arab organizations that opposed moves to 
send a panarab force to protect saudi arabia from iraqi attack 
when they were agreed at the arab summit in cairo aug 10 
it refused to join in the condemnation of iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait 
bruce and miller are part of a pool flown to the persian gulf by 
the british ministry of defense 
raf tornadoes and us warplanes were taking off and landing at 
regular intervals transport aircraft carrying supplies and weapons 
were being unloaded miller said 
the scale of britains deployment of 12 tornado f3 fighters is 
dwarfed by the us presence which is in the thousands 
but the tornadoes are flying regular training missions close to 
the border with kuwait where 120000 of iraqi president saddam 
husseins troops are dug in miller said 
britain has about 1700 airmen and engineers as its land 
contribution to the growing allied force in the area this includes 
the tornadoes at dhahran and a jaguar ground attack squadron in 
nearby oman 
squadron leader ted threapleton 38 a navigator with the 
tornado group said monday night we are doing the job for which 
we have trained and humor and morale is high 
the standard of accommodation for the british forces is 
comparatively high they have portakabinstyle buildings with air 
conditioning and some british television channels are available

a lawyer who for weeks has publicly 
defended himself against reports he was a suspect in a serial 
killing investigation was charged monday him with one of the nine 
slayings 
kenneth c ponte 40 who now lives in port richey fla 
entered a plea in court that he was absolutely not guilty bail 
was set at 500000 surety or 50000 cash and ponte was released 
after his mother posted her home 
the indictment charging ponte with murder was filed last week 
but was sealed to give authorities time to notify victims 
relatives it accused ponte of the beating death of rochelle 
clifford dopierla and said she was beaten and died on april 27 
1988 
she is one of nine women whose bodies were found near this 
southeastern massachusetts community between july 1988 and april 
1989 two other women are missing and presumed to be victims all 
had histories of drug use and some were prostitutes 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina declined to say if 
ponte was a suspect in the other slayings but court documents show 
that authorities believe he had a personal relationship with at 
least three victims 
several relatives of victims were in court when ponte entered 
his plea 
one of them chandra greenlaw the daughter of a victim said 
later of ponte i want to see him hung 
pontes attorney kevin reddington complained of the negative 
publicity ponte has lived under while his name has been in 
circulation as a suspect 
this man has been under more intense pressure for the past six 
months than anyone i can imagine said reddington 
ponte remained silent for months but in recent weeks has given 
several lengthy interviews to reporters insisting he is the victim 
of a witch hunt 
mr ponte welcomes a trial reddington said he needs a 
trial to clear his name 
ponte also is awaiting trial on other indictments earlier this 
year he was charged with three counts of conspiracy to possess 
cocaine last year he was charged with assault with a dangerous 
weapon in connection with a 1988 fight with a man 
pina told superior court judge george hurd that ponte crossed 
the line from the legal community and became a member of the drug 
community 
this man went into a drug world he recruited women he used 
them to purchase his drugs he brought them into his home pina 
said 
dopierla was one such woman and she was planning to expose 
pontes drug activities pina said 
the motive was to get rid of a witness he said 
after the hearing ponte echoed the comments of his attorney 
i just want to say its been a twoyearlong nightmare for me 
so far said ponte he said his indictment was simply political 
showmanship on the part of ron pina who is up for reelection 
this year 
pina seeking his fourth term faces a sept 18 democratic 
primary challenge by new bedford lawyer paul f walsh jr who has 
accused pina of political motivation in his handling of the case 
pina denied any political motive in the timing of the 
indictments saying of the grand jury they dont work for me 
the 21member panel began meeting in march 1989 
it was pina who in 1984 prosecuted the widely publicized big 
dans rape trial involving a 1983 gang rape at a tavern of that 
name in new bedford four were convicted two were acquitted 
charges they cheered during the attack the story was later made 
into a movie 
pina defended the length of the investigation saying the case 
involved complex events in new bedfords drug community the drug 
community is not a member of the chamber of commerce pina said 
investigators have reported that dopierlas mother told them her 
daughter once gave her pontes home telephone if her mother wanted 
to reach her in new bedford 
ponte has said his only contact with dopierla was in april 1988 
when he as a lawyer helped her with a man whom she accused of 
raping her

peace talks between salvadoran 
government and guerrilla negotiators have bogged down over rebel 
demands that the army be abolished and officers be punished for 
politically motivated murders participants said monday 
oscar santamaria justice minister and head of the government 
delegation described the addition of new guerrilla demands since 
the july round of talks as a setback 
the introduction of new documents with further demands alters 
and distorts the course of the negotiation it the guerrilla 
document is not in accord with the seriousness of the peace 
process he said 
the farabundo marti national liberation front the insurgent 
army known as the fmln submitted an 18point document its first 
demand calls for the total demilitarization of society by means 
of disappearance of the two armies 
the rebels in previous rounds of talks had demanded trial and 
punishment of officers implicated in four noted human rights cases 
including the 1980 assassination of archbishop oscar romero and 
last novembers massacre by army troops of six jesuit 
priesteducators their housekeeper and her daughter 
the new document adds demands for punishment of those 
responsible for two other cases as well as the murders 
massacres and bombardments of civilians that have occurred during 
the negotiations 
the document also demands investigations to determine 
responsibility for 20 other specific crimes in addition to all 
the crimes murders disappearances and massacres committed since 
1979 
this is what is needed to create a new society said rebel 
chief francisco mena sandoval a former army captain who switched 
sides in 1981 
one member of the government delegation called the new guerrilla 
proposal a low blow another said it appeared designed to 
postpone the reaching of any substantial accord 
the rebels who last november launched the wars biggest 
offensive in the capital say they are prepared to make another 
major military push if no signficant accords are reached soon 
guerrilla commanders have said privately they believe the army 
is more vulnerable now than at any time in recent years for three 
reasons the impact of last years rebel offensive the implication 
of several officers in the jesuits massacre and the imminent 
reduction of us military aid 
this session is the fourth round of monthly unmediated talks 
that began in venezuela in may the negotiations have produced only 
one accord on human rights signed last month 
the negotiators had moved on from the first item on the agenda 
the armed forces after nearly three sessions failed to produce 
significant movement on that subject 
both sides agree the military issue is the most difficult and 
crucial to an agreement 
the rebels say they are unwilling to again set aside the subject 
of the armed forces and pursue agreements in other areas 
the armed forces is really the only subject said guerrilla 
commander eduardo sancho 
also on the sevenpoint agenda are the pursuit of agreements on 
electoral judicial and constitutional reform economic matters and 
international supervision to ensure that eventual accords are 
carried out 
the administration of president alfredo cristiani a 
conservative backed by the united states says it is willing to 
restructure reform and reduce the armed forces but not abolish 
them 
participants in the talks agree that a midseptember ceasefire 
set as a preliminary objective in may appears virtually impossible 
in el salvador the army monday reported two clashes and rebels 
said they ambushed an army patrol 
five guerrillas were killed in fighting 50 miles north of san 
salvador in chalatenango province an army communique said 
another clash near jocoitique 125 miles northeast of san 
salvador in morazan province killed one guerrilla the communique 
said 
guerrillas also dynamited six more power poles the attack 
followed the destruction of 42 posts and pylons last week that left 
nearly half the country without electricity for two days and caused 
power rationing in the rest of the country 
the nearly 11yearold civil war has killed an estimated 72000 
people most of them civilians

a government program offering wild horses for 
adoption to citizens is becoming increasingly costly with no 
evidence that federal rangeland has benefited a congressional 
study said monday 
the interior departments adoptahorse program is aimed at 
removing wild horses from federal rangeland so that herds do not 
exceed what the land can support about 60000 wild horses have 
gone through the program over the last decade 
but the general accounting office the investigative agency of 
congress questioned in a report whether the program is needed 
range conditions have not demonstrably improved and the 
number of wild horses removed has exceeded the capacity of the 
program the gao said 
the study said the interior departments estimates on how many 
horses should be removed often is based on unreliable information 
as to what the rangeland is able to accommodate 
in some cases the bureau of land management has removed horses 
from ranges only to increase authorized livestock grazing by 
ranchers thereby negating any reduction in total forage 
consumption and potential for range improvement the study said 
at the same time the government continues to have problems in 
disposing of horses taken off the range the study said 
some horses remain at training facilities for as long as 19 
months when no more than two months are needed for the training 
driving up the cost of the program 
the gao said the government also may face a costly longterm 
commitment to providing sanctuaries for horses that are not 
adopted the cost of the first such sanctuary is now nearly 
900000 a year and other sanctuaries likely will be needed the 
study said 
the report noted that the wild horse program had been the focus 
of other problems in the past because of an inability to find homes 
for the horses 
between 1984 and 1988 the blm opened the program to largescale 
adopters resulting in abuse of the program and thousands of the 
horses being sold by adopters to slaughterhouses 
the feewaiver adoption program resulted in the abuse and 
commercial exploitation of thousands of wild horses contrary to 
blms legislative direction the gao said noting that the 
program was halted in 1988 after public and congressional outcries 
the gao cited no evidence of such practices continuing but it 
noted that the regulations allowing a waiver of fees for adoptions 
has not been rescinded 
the blm earlier this year proposed new rules aimed at preventing 
a single adopter from controlling large numbers of wild horses 
reducing the potential for profits and abuses under the program

twenty black angular f117a stealth 
fighters kicked up rooster tails of spray monday as they took off 
on wet runways at langley air force base for their muchpublicized 
deployment to the middle east 
one of the planes returned shortly after takeoff under clouds 
and periodic showers air force officials were unable to say why 
the plane turned back 
air force col ron sconyers spokesman for the tactical air 
command at langley said it would take the radarevading planes 12 
to 15 hours and several inflight refuelings to reach bases in 
saudi arabia 
air force officials were mum on exactly what role will be played 
by the f117a which is designed to bomb targets behind enemy lines 
unlike some other aircraft sent to the area after the aug 2 
iraqi invasion and occupation of kuwait the f117a cannot be 
considered a defensive weapon said col anthony tolin assistant 
deputy chief of staff of the tactical air command at langley and 
wing commander for the stealth fighters until last week 
i think they provide a great deal of deterrence the iraqis 
know we can get in hit the target and get out without ever 
appearing on their radar that has to give them pause tolin said 
sunday when the planes arrived 
they give us an ability should we need it to get in with the 
least amount of casualties and attack those important targets if 
necessary tolin said 
the planes saw combat during the panama invasion when they 
attacked a radar site 
the fighters flew to langley from their home base at nellis air 
force base in nevada technicians and ground support personnel also 
were en route to saudi arabia sconyers said two of the fighters 
were held back for maintenance reasons 
the 426 millionacopy f117a is one of the most expensive 
planes the pentagon ever launched billions were spent on the 
research necessary to make the plane invisible to radar it was 
once so secret the air force flew it only at night missions high 
above the nevada desert the plane was designed and built by 
lockheed cos supersecret skunk works plant in burbank calif

american military cargo 
planes are being allowed to operate from this arab federation the 
second persian gulf nation to accept foreign troops in response to 
the ongoing crisis with iraq secretary of defense dick cheney said 
monday 
its a measure of the seriousness of the situation of the 
fact theyre deeply concerned that their very existence is being 
threatened by saddam hussein cheney told reporters traveling 
with him on a fourday mission to garner support from gulf states 
a squadron of 16 c130 cargo transports and about 575 air force 
support personnel are at bateen air base here to join operation 
desert shield cheney said 
it was the first time one of the moderate arab governments in 
the southern gulf region has publicly announced such overt military 
cooperation with the united states even though several states had 
quietly worked to help such us operations as the reflagging of 
kuwaiti tankers during the iraniraq war 
king fahd of saudi arabia agreed earlier to allow the influx of 
tens of thousands of us military personnel as well as other 
foreign troops 
cheney said the emirates are eager to cooperate with the 
united states and the other forces that have joined in the 
multinational effort to ensure that saddam doesnt come any 
further 
the announcement came after cheney met at a white marble and 
gilt waterside palace with sheik zayed al nahyan president of the 
united arab emirates a group of seven loose alliances 
cheney said nations once cool to a us military presence are 
prepared now to actively engage with us taking steps to enhance 
their security that would not have been possible prior to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait 
cheneys presence in this muslim nation of 16 million on the 
southern edge of the gulf was remarkable in itself he is the 
highestranking us official ever to visit the arab state 
cheney arrived in jiddah saudi arabia after making a detour to 
qatar he visited five persian gulf states within 15 hours 
cheney also was to travel monday to oman and jiddah saudi 
arabia where he was scheduled to meet with the saudi royal family 
and to doha qatar 
being here in the uae is a significant departure for us 
cheney said as he visited a c130 crew near the flight line 
asked about possible arms sales to nations in the region cheney 
said he believed there was a general interest in finding ways 
to strengthen the security position of the governments of the gulf 
in the years ahead 
we want to work with them in training and exercises while we 
are here and add equipment if thats what they need to enhance 
their own selfdefense capabilities he said 
meanwhile as thousands of us military personnel continue to 
pour into saudi arabia support units went to work the 314th 
tactical airlift wing from little rock ark pieced together a 
small town of small airconditioned mobile homes within 48 hours of 
their arrival five days ago 
while some of the airmen and crews worked to maintain the four 
huge propellers of the giant green c130 transport planes on the 
tarmac several dozen men dressed in cutoffs and tshirts lounged 
outside their housing units hoping to catch a glimpse of cheney 
while the buildings may keep the searing whitehot desert sun 
at bay even those used to arkansas weather took a beating from the 
heat 
i dont think ive ever drank this much water in my life 
said col dave mason the groups commander 
mason said some of his crews had just flown 30000 mres meals 
ready to eat overnight and were ready to transport other loads 
of ammunition foodstuffs and supplies 
piled high inside a hangar were the squadrons tents some food 
supplies and water filtration gear the unit is drinking about 
2000 bottles of water per day 
some 35 missions have already been flown by the group assigned 
to haul cargo that has been flown or shipped in from the united 
states throughout the saudi arabian peninsula 
its rough very rough said a female captain from monroe 
nc one of the 13 women with the squadron i just left a

voluntary basis

were among 495 passengers who flew in from baghdad aboard an iraqi 
airways jumbo jet 
sources at queen alia airport said all eight were of arab origin 
and carried travel documents other than their american passports 
iraq has refused to allow most westerners to leave iraqi territory 
in the aftermath of international condemnation of its aug 2 
invasion of kuwait

the kingdom were being advised to leave in accordance with a state 
department advisory to all us citizens to defer nonessential 
travel to jordan 
he added that nonessential staff at the embassy and their

jordanian government statistics say there are about 3000 
american citizens in the country many of them with dual 
jordanianus citizenship

its official the seabrook power plant 
which became a symbol of the nations debate over nuclear energy 
has begun regular operation 
after more than a decade of protests and huge cost overruns the 
milestone was reached sunday utility spokesman said ron sher said 
monday 
the plants operator new hampshire yankee emphasized the plant 
supplies enough electricity for a million new england homes 
opponents still fret about the potential for disaster 
the declaration the plant is in regular operation for the plant 
is partly a matter of semantics during the final weeks of testing 
which were declared successful friday night the 66 billion 
plants reactor ran at full power it has been generating at least 
some power for customers on the regions power grid since tests 
began in may 
seabrook station is one of nine nuclear power plants in new 
england that together generate more than onethird of the regions 
electricity reducing the dependence on extremely expensive and 
unreliable foreign oil supplies said edward brown president of 
new hampshire yankee 
it took a decade to build the seaside plant which was completed 
in 1986 but didnt receive an operating license until last spring 
because of regulatory delays caused by the plants opponents 
seabrook became the national focus of antinuclear activists and 
drew opposition from nearby residents who said the surrounding area 
couldnt be evacuated safely if there was a nuclear disaster more 
than 3000 protesters were arrested at the plant over the years 
the clamshell alliance which led the protests believes state 
residents should view any seabrook landmarks as setbacks said 
spokesman roy morrison thats becuase the plant produces nuclear 
waste and has the potential to make new england uninhabitable he 
said 
court challenges of the operating license still are pending and 
the nuclear regulatory commission said last week it was looking 
into whether there were irregularities in the way the plant got its 
license 
morrison said seabrook operators made the operation official 
monday to distract attention from the commissions investigation 
the project originally called for two reactors at a cost of less 
than 1 billion but was scaled back to one reactor because of 
skyrocketing costs and lengthy constrution delays the plants 
major owner public service company of new hampshire went into 
bankruptcy in part because of seabrook costs and is being taken 
over by northeast utilities of connecticut another plant owner 
the plant produces 1150 megawatts of electricity enough to 
eliminate the need for about 15 million barrels of oil a month 
said new hampshire yankee 
iraqs invasion of oilrich kuwait makes it painfully clear 
that new england must immediately begin vigorous development of 
alternative domestic energy sources that are not dependent upon 
events halfway around the world said senior vice president ted 
feigenbaum who will soon replace the retiring brown 
sher said each of the plants utility owners and utility 
regulators in their states would decide how much to charge for 
electricity 
besides new hampshire and connecticut companies in the 
massachusetss and vermont own shares of the plant

armenian militants fired on a bus in an 
azerbaijani village with machine guns and grenade launchers and in 
a fight with police one passenger and a policeman were killed 
tass reported monday 
the official soviet news agency said the clash occurred sunday 
on the armenianazerbaijani border one of the most explosive 
places in the soviet union because of ethnic tensions 
the militants in the hundreds and hidden in hills fired at a 
commuter bus in azerbaijans kazakh region killing a policeman and 
wounding four passengers interior ministry officials told tass 
troops called to the area killed one and injured two of the 
terrorists two servicemen were also hurt 
armenian president levon terpetrosyan told his republics 
parliament in the capital yerevan on monday that the clash was 
triggered by the capture of armenian hostages in the area the 
armenian militants moved in to release the hostages he said in 
remarks carried by tass the dispatch did not say who held the 
hostages or what the captors demands were 
armenia and azerbaijan on the southern border of the soviet 
union have been at loggerheads since february 1988 in a dispute 
over nagornokarabakh the district has been in azerbaijans hands 
since the 1920s but armenians want control over it and have been 
campaigning to get it with strikes demonstrations and political 
moves 
in another development involving one of the soviet unions more 
than 100 ethnic groups a congress of local councilmen in a section 
of the moldavian republic located on the romanian border declared 
formation of a new republic on sunday 
tass reported monday that the gagauz a christian turkish people 
who are a small minority in moldavia sent a message to the kremlin 
requesting recognition of the gagauz republic as part of the soviet 
union 
it was unlikely the kremlin would go along with the move because 
creation of a new republic requires the consent of other affected 
republics and that hasnt come yet

field workers aboard broke loose while being towed during a storm 
in the north sea and was floating free in rough seas monday 
phillips petroleum co said 
no injuries were reported and the captain decided that all 
personnel should remain aboard until the waves abate and a new 
towline can be attached said george minter a spokesman at 
phillips headquarters in bartlesville 
theyre waiting for the wind to die down and it looks like 
its going to according to the weather reports minter said 
monday afternoon he said the rig was located about 80 miles off 
the coast of denmark 
two boats from denmark were trailing the rig he said 
the queen elizabeth ii was in the area when the towline broke

an american who escaped from kuwait 
by dashing across the desert disguised as an arab said monday that 
westerners still trapped there might be able to escape if theyre 
willing to risk it 
steve diemler 35 was reunited with his family at his parents 
home here sunday he escaped to saudi arabia on friday in a convoy 
of 13 vehicles carrying 30 to 40 foreigners 
i would tell them to get out if they can take the risk 
diemler said in an interview monday i couldnt have made it by 
myself and wouldnt advise anyone to do it alone you have to have 
someone extremely knowledgeable about the area 
but he added it is up to the individual to weigh the risk i 
took the chance and made it and hope others can do it behind me 
but i dont want to tell a bunch of people to do it and get them 
killed 
he said his convoy was guided across the open desert by bedouin 
nomads who refused to take any money for their assistance the only 
thing they wanted he said was the promise of american help 
he decided to make his escape after iraq last week ordered 
foreigners in kuwait to go to specific hotels 
i mean nobody really thought it was for our own protection 
he said sunday everybody knew the next stop would be baghdad or 
someplace else we knew it was turning into a formal hostage 
situation 
the 35yearold jefferson city native who has lived in kuwait 
for 10 years working as a radar adviser to the kuwait air force 
arrived sunday in a st louis tv stations helicopter that landed 
in a field next to his parents home 
family and friends waited in the front yard where yellow ribbons 
were tied to the trunks and limbs of a halfdozen trees 
wearing a tshirt with the question where in the world is 
kuwait one of his first comments was i got out of a place 
thats not so nice a place to be 
diemler said he managed to escape because i knew people who 
might know people he said he wore the traditional outfit for 
kuwait men of a long white robe and headband with scarf to disguise 
his western appearance 
the escape was the most frightening because it was going out 
into the unknown we had heard all kinds of things he said 
at the start i thought it was a pretty desperate thing 
theres no way to be sure iraqis wouldnt shoot at us and we were 
in close proximity of tanks armored personnel carriers and 
troops 
while waiting for the guides to arrive diemler said iraqi 
soldiers drove by three times but didnt stop i thought it was 
all over before it ever started he said 
he said after the convoy started out they were forced to turn 
around by iraqi troops the convoy went a few miles down the road 
turned off into the desert and headed out as fast as they could 
travel 
he declined to give specific details of his escape because i 
wouldnt want to say anything that might jeopardize the chances of 
somebody else who is going to follow me 
elsewhere robert and katherine hansen of tulsa okla said 
monday they decided to try to escape from kuwait after hearing the 
borders would be open on aug 13 hansen a consultant to the 
kuwait ministry of health said a sandstorm made them turn back on 
their first attempt but they met a group of people preparing to 
leave 
they had seven cars and someone who knew the desert said 
hansen former dean of the oral roberts university dental college 
the group of 18 had to abandon one car stuck in the sand and 
cross several large oil pipelines during the threehour drive to 
the saudi arabian border he said 
we were led on a route that did not have iraqi soldiers he 
said

president bush declared for the first time 
monday that 3000 americans trapped in iraq and kuwait are 
hostages america will not be intimidated he said demanding 
their release as the us buildup of forces in the region proceeded 
at full speed 
i want there to be no misunderstanding i will hold the 
government of iraq responsible for the safety of american citizens 
held against their will bush told cheering war veterans in a 
blistering speech in baltimore 
it could get fairly tough over there he said later at a 
republican fundraising appearance in north kingstown ri 
bush called iraqi president saddam hussein a man of evil 
standing against human life itself but he added it was not 
with passionate hate but really with a heavy heart that i had to 
commit our troops to saudi arabia to head off possible iraqi 
attack 
no shots have been fired in that desert standoff but us 
warships have sent warning shots near two iraqi tankers in an 
effort to enforce an embargo on goods going in or out of iraq 
asked late monday whether the united states was prepared to stop 
the tankers which kept moving despite the warning bush said 
merely just watch just watch and see 
in kuwait city meanwhile at least 12 americans along with a 
number of other foreigners were taken from hotels and moved to 
undisclosed locations the state department said 
the americans were among 2500 us citizens who were in the 
persian gulf country when it was overrun by iraqi forces three 
weeks ago about 530 others are in iraq 
thirtyfive americans who had been taken from kuwait to a hotel 
in baghdad were removed last week and remain unaccounted for us 
officials said 
without giving any numbers iraq said monday it had moved 
westerners to potential us military target areas and it warned 
its people not to hide foreigners 
the official iraqi news agency quoted a spokesman for baghdads 
ruling national council as saying iraqs foreign guests have 
been in fact moved to all vital and military installations they 
have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in 
good physical condition 
elsewhere in the inflamed gulf region defense secretary dick 
cheney claimed success in an early stop on a supportseeking trip 
announcing that the united arab emirates had agreed to let a 
squadron of us military transport planes use their land 
in saudi arabia military officials said the united states was 
moving significant forces with offensive capabilities into 
positions from which they could launch strikes into occupied 
kuwait according to military officials 
i dont see us going into kuwait but if those orders ever came 
we would obviously want to be ready one senior us officer said 
in a news media pool report 
in washington the state department advised americans to defer 
nonessential travel to jordan in light of continuing unstable 
conditions in the region a stiffer advisory was issued for yemen 
nonessential embassy personnel and dependents were ordered to 
leave and all other american citizens without essential reasons for 
remaining were advised to do so as well after antiamerican 
demonstrations in the capital of sanaa 
bush in his speech to the veterans of foreign wars renewed his 
call for saddam to release americans and thousands of other 
westerners in iraq and kuwait the president again compared saddam 
to hitler and also accused him of violating his own religion 
with no sign of a nonmilitary solution to the heightening 
persian gulf crisis in sight bush told the veterans today the 
outcome is not yet decided hard choices remain but of this we are 
certain america will not be intimidated 
bush had previously refused to use the word hostages to 
characterize the detained americans aides pointed out that saddam 
had not asked for anything in return for their release and also 
said that calling them hostages might make them seem more 
significant and make it harder for saddam to release them 
on sunday in fact presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater took issue with un ambassador thomas pickerings use of 
the word 
but bush on monday said it was time to state the obvious 
weve been reluctant to use the term hostage but when saddam 
hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens 
of many nations he holds against their will in return for 
concessions there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent 
people are called they are in fact hostages 
saddams government said sunday that the foreigners would be 
allowed freedom if the united states withdrew its military forces 
from the persian gulf region and scuttled the international trade 
blockade against iran and kuwait an offer the administration 
quickly rejected 
an nbc newswall street journal poll conducted over the weekend 
found that 72 percent of those surveyed approve of how bush is 
handling the crisis seventy percent said they approve of the 
presidents decision to send military forces to saudi arabia and 
the persian gulf the telephone poll of 805 registered voters had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent nbc said 
on a oneday trip from kennebunkport maine where he was in the 
second week of a vacation bush traveled to the white house for 
meetings then to baltimore and on to rhode island before returning 
to maine 
back in kennebunkport bush telephoned french president francois 
mitterrand to talk about the hostage situation and thank him for 
frances firm response and leadership in the crisis he also 
called turkeys president turgut ozal with warm words and in his 
rhode island remarks he praised britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher as well 
the white house says there are no plans for him to cut off the 
annual vacation before his planned labor day return to washington 
his speech monday included some of the most fiery remarks he has 
made on the crisis following a weekend when he testily rebuffed 
reporters attempts to question him while he played golf and went 
to church services 
in his speech bush made a religious appeal to the leaders of 
iraq 
in moving foreign citizens against their will you are 
violating the norms of your own religion he said you are 
going against the ageold arab tradition of showing kindness and 
hospitality to visitors and so my message is release all 
foreigners now 
iraqs invasion was more than a military attack on tiny 
kuwait he said of the aug 2 military incursion by iraq on its 
oilrich neighbor 
it was a ruthless assault on the very essence of international 
order and civilized ideals and now in a further offense against 
all norms of international behavior iraq has imposed restrictions 
against civilians from many countries this is unacceptable 
bush said the eruption of the crisis in the persian gulf 
demonstrated a need for a strong military and he called on congress 
to avoid deep cuts in his military budget beyond the paring his 
administration recommends

researchers arent sure why but a study has 
found that mexicanamericans whose prenatal care is as poor as 
blacks nonetheless have a much lower infant mortality rate even 
slightly lower than whites 
mexicanamerican women and their babies are a real anomaly 
said dr joel c kleinman an analyst with the national center for 
health statistics a branch of the atlantabased centers for 
disease control 
they have a much much lower level of education tend to be 
poorer and get relatively little prenatal care but they do very 
well in infant mortality he said 
in an interview last week he discussed the study which was 
released in july 
there are a number of hypotheses why mexicanamerican 
infants have a better survival rate than black infants kleinman 
said those include a lot more social support than other 
comparable groups like blacks and maybe some dietary factors 
we are not aware of he said 
we have to really do a lot more study of mexicanamericans to 
understand why they do so well he said 
the study found that 187 out of every 1000 black infants born 
in the united states died before their first birthday more than 
double the white rate and worst of any ethnic group studied 
but mexicanamericans infant mortality rate was only 90 
slightly better than the white rate of 91 
thats true even though only about 60 percent of 
mexicanamerican women got prenatal care in the first trimester 
the same percentage as black puerto rican and american indian 
women among white cuban and asian women in this country about 80 
percent got early prenatal care 
mexicanamerican women also have a higher percentage of teenage 
births than whites 18 percent to 11 percent but less than black 
women at 24 percent 
health experts say infants of teenage mothers are at increased 
risk for health complications probably due to poorer economic 
standing nutrition and medical care 
mexicans are the third largest minority group in the united 
states accounting for onequarter million births per year the 
researchers report said they appear to have relatively good 
pregnancy outcomes despite a high rate of poverty and low use of 
prenatal care 
the latest overall infant mortality rate for the nation is 104 
per 1000 births just 22nd in the world in early reports from 
1986 statistics federal health officials project a 1990 rate of 
91 
the lowest infant mortality rate in the united states is for 
japaneseamerican infants 6 per 1000 asianamericans in general 
have a rate of 86 slightly better than whites and 
mexicanamericans 
cubanamericans also have a low infant mortality rate 78 per 
1000 
one of the explanations for cubans is their generally 
higher socioeconomic group kleinman said generally theyre 
about the same as usborn whites 
the statistics in the study come from 1983 and 1984 birth and 
death certificates the latest available when the comprehensive 
study was launched hispanic data come from 23 states which collect 
such statistics 
the study is the first to match birth and death files in an 
attempt to avoid earlier inconsistencies in classifying hispanics 
the agency said

occurred while she was jogging in onondaga lake park in this city 
250 miles northwest of new york 
she walked about two miles for help with a knife protuding from 
her neck 
this is one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this 
county said onondaga county assistant district attorney mary 
felasco the defendant got his just desserts justice was 
served 
the verdict was handed down just two days after three youths 
were convicted in manhattan in the muchpublicized 1989 rape and 
assault of the central park jogger like the syracuse woman she 
survived despite serious injuries but unlike the syracuse victim 
the central park jogger suffered brain damage and could not

israel will allow egyptians fleeing iraq and 
kuwait to travel through the jewish state on their way home 
israeli television said monday 
the television report said egyptian ambassador mohammed 
bassiouny met with foreign minister david levy to request that 
egyptians stranded in jordan after leaving iraq be allowed to 
transit israel 
the television report quoted levy as saying it seemed a 
natural step to help the citizens of a friendly nation fleeing 
tyranny 
meanwhile egypts official middle east news agency quoted a 
source in the egyptian foreign ministry as denying reports that 
egyptians returning home from iraq would pass through israel 
but a top israeli official confirmed that egyptians stuck in the 
jordanian port of aqaba awaiting transportation home would start 
traveling through israel within days 
the egyptians will travel the five miles from aqaba to the 
israeli resort of eilat on the red sea and then four miles to the 
israeliegyptian border at taba said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
we are just being humanitarian and good neighborly the 
official said 
the official said bassiouny will travel to cairo on tuesday to 
formally inform president hosni mubarak of israels decision 
many egyptians who have reached jordan are unable to get air or 
sea transport home 
bassiouny told levy that thousands of egyptians are stranded in 
aqaba and the situation is growing worse daily according to the 
israeli television report 
more than 54000 egyptians have already returned to egypt after 
fleeing kuwait and iraq and tens of thousands of others are still 
on their way according to egyptian officials 
some of the returning egyptian refugees have accused iraqi 
troops of stealing their valuables and raping women in kuwait 
israel army radio reported that egypt sent 35 buses to aqaba on 
monday the radio report said egyptians traveling from aqaba 
through israel would not be subject to a passport check 
usually egyptians crossing the israeli border are thoroughly 
searched 
israel has been considering this move since thousands of 
egyptians and other foreigners began fleeing into jordan after 
iraqi troops invaded kuwait on aug 2 
despite the importance israel places on its relations with 
egypt israeli officials had hesitated to open the tightly guarded 
border to permit thousands of egyptians to pass through daily 
egypt is the only arab country to have signed a peace treaty 
with israel the 1979 camp david accords under which israel agreed 
to return the sinai peninsula to egypt 
the israeli action comes after iraqi president saddam hussein 
announced that he will hold westerners in iraq and kuwait using 
some of them as human shields at strategic installations 
egyptian president hosni mubarak has sent several thousand 
troops to saudi arabia as part of a multinational arab force to 
deter a possible iraqi attack 
but despite the egyptian governments actions saddam has 
allowed thousands of egyptians to cross into jordan before the 
crisis there were an estimated 150000 egyptians in kuwait and 16 
million in iraq 
on monday 700 egyptian refugees arrived in the port of suez on 
board the egyptian ferry eltor that sailed from aqaba 
some of the passengers recounted tales of horror following the 
aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait they said iraqi soldiers 
treatment of egyptians worsened after mubarak hosted the aug 10 
arab league summit in cairo that decided to send a joint arab force 
to saudi arabia 
i saw four iraqi soldiers burst into the hosptial where i work 
and take away two nurses to rape said samia ibrahim a 
30yearold nurse they forced us to work for 14hour shifts with 
no pay and they stole our food and money 
in order to let us through they stole our video tapes and any 
other electric appliances she said 
hossam eldin zaky elsayed 26 said iraqi soldiers even stole 
his watch before letting him leave 
the returnees said they left most of their money and valuables 
behind officials say egyptian expatriates had billions of dollars 
in kuwaiti banks most of which have been looted by iraqi soldiers

mayor w wilson goode urging philadelphians 
not to panic pleaded with the state and the city council monday 
night to help him raise taxes and cut spending to avoid a 206 
million deficit 
we are not bankrupt goode said however we must stop 
reading lips and start read the writing on the wall this city 
needs new tax revenues 
he spoke as his administration announced an emergency borrowing 
plan needed to keep the city from running out of cash next month 
goode during an halfhour televised speech called on the state 
legislature to give the city power to increase taxes by 150 
million the tax burden would be spread among consumers homeowners 
and businesses he said 
goode also called for the lease or sale of veterans stadium 
home of baseballs phillies and the football eagles other city 
assets also might be sold including the water department 
on monday goodes administration announced plans to borrow 400 
million through temporary loan notes within the next two weeks 
without the notes the city would be out of cash by late 
september according to a report issued monday by city finance 
director betsy reveal 
even with them the citys general fund would be out of cash by 
may unless both interim and permanent corrective measures are 
taken the report said 
goode said the citys financial problems grew over decades with 
previous administrations merely taking temporary steps to avoid 
crises and were exacerbated by the recession now gripping the 
northeast 
he also blamed the state legislature saying its power to 
prevent tax increases is strangling the city 
goode also criticized the city council saying it repeatedly has 
thwarted his attempts to raise taxes over the years he asked the 
council to cooperate and outlined several steps needed he said must 
be taken immediately 
a freeze on city hiring and developments 
a repeal of the citys early retirement program 
an assessment of the measures the citys unions are willing to 
undertake to cut costs 
a cut in all nonessential services which he did not list 
a complete assessment of buildings that could be sold or leased 
goodes speech was his first public reaction since word of the 
impending financial crisis leaked out a week ago 
the note sale is expected the week of aug 27 unless the city 
can obtain a letter of credit in which case it would be postponed 
one week said reveal 
the city reportedly has had trouble attracting buyers for the 
notes lead underwriter for the public offering will be merrill 
lynch capital markets 
the citys fiscal 1991 budget which was balanced on paper when 
it was passed in may projected the deficit for the previous fiscal 
year would amount to 608 million however the deficit was 
swollen by sluggish tax receipts on commercial property and other 
tax receipts and is projected at 738 million in the new report 
that amount must be paid during the current 1991 fiscal year 
which began june 30 
according to the report 1991 revenues will be 1062 million 
less than expected when the budget was adopted and obligations will 
be 1323 million more than expected 
the decrease in revenues was blamed partly on the state 
legislatures refusal to approve a halfcent local sales tax and 
mandatory withholding of the city wage tax 
the 2064 million deficit projection does not include a 45 
million subsidy for the regional masstransit system goode has 
vowed to withhold the subsidy for southeastern pennsylvania 
transportation authority unless the city gets approval of and

about 40 zairean students who have been occupying 
their embassy in beijing for six days were given an ultimatum 
monday by chinese authorities to leave immediately the students 
said 
the students began their occupation last wednesday holding the 
ambassador and his staff hostage in the walled embassy compound 
the students are protesting their governments failure to provide 
promised living allowances and plane tickets home for graduates 
at about noon six chinese officials from the chinese foreign 
ministry the state education commission and the beijing public 
security bureau came to the zairean embassy to deliver the 
ultimatum 
they told us that we had to leave immediately if we dont 
they will take the necessary measures said katembo salumu 29 
who graduated from qinghua university this summer 
the officials did not elaborate but cautioned that this was 
the last warning the students said 
the education commission confirmed the visit took place but 
refused to give details the foreign ministry said it had no 
comment 
the chinese government had not previously been involved in the 
dispute although several uniformed and plainclothed police in a 
public security car kept watch outside the embassy each day 
it is the second year in a row the students have staged a sitin 
at the embassy with the same complaints 
zairean ambassador lombo lo mangamanga said the police last year 
refused to enter the compound when he asked them to remove the 
students 
the students said mondays visit was prompted by a meeting in 
zaire between their foreign minister mushobekwa wakalimba and the 
chinese ambassador 
salumu said the students told the chinese authorities this is 
not a problem with the chinese its with our own government 
we told them we will stay here if they want to take any 
measures its up to them we are not scared said bangala ngoy 
29 a graduate student at shanghais huadong chemical engineering 
college 
the students have said they would stay at the embassy until they 
get their living subsidies which have not been paid in at least 14 
months and until their government pays for air tickets home for 
seven graduates 
the students have locked the embassy compound gates with a 
bicycle chain refusing to allow the halfdozen zairean diplomats 
out or the embassys chinese staff in 
last thursday mangamanga arranged for the chinese government to 
provide plane tickets for the students who had none but the 
students refused to accept the settlement arguing that their 
government should pay for the tickets it promised to provide 
the students said they were told the zaire foreign minister told 
the chinese ambassador that funds for their living allowances have 
been transferred to belgium from where it would be forwarded to 
beijing 
zaire has about 80 zairean studying in china one of the 
largest groups of african students here under friendship 
agreements signed in the 1960s china gives scholarships to 
students from many african countries to complete entire degree 
programs in china usually in the sciences 
each year students from several african countries complain that 
they are not getting promised funds and plane tickets home from 
their governments

soldiers sweltering in the middle east 
will get some seasoned help soon when the 3rd armored cavalry one 
of the armys elite desert units ships out officials said monday 
the entire regiment with nearly 4500 soldiers 1700 vehicles 
and 75 aircraft will be dispatched to the persian gulf said the 
regiments commander col doug starr 
he said his troops are used to dealing with the searing heat and 
windwhipped sand theyll encounter while helping the united states 
face off with iraqs saddam hussein whose troops are massed on the 
border of kuwait and saudi arabia 
the unit regularly leaves fort bliss to train in southern new 
mexico west texas and the california desert 
were well trained in the desert used to the desert 
acclimated to the desert starr said we feel we are ready to 
deploy to whatever part of the middle east the commander in chief 
may want to send us 
starr said the unit knows from experience how to keep military 
working in the harsh desert climate how much water each soldier 
needs and how to endure insufferable temperatures inside a tank 
the inside of a tank in this type of environment is a tough 
place to be it requires a lot of physical fitness a lot of 
desert acclimation theres just no easy answer to how you 
defeat the heat said starr 
it may be thoroughly trained but the unit lacks combat 
experience starr said he and one other officer and a few senior 
enlisted soldiers are the only members of the regiment with combat 
experience 
the regiment will act as a flank guard or on scouting missions 
doing reconnaissance and feeding intelligence to other units 
what well lend to that theater is a great deal of combat 
power starr said 
the regiment has been loading vehicles on rail cars since aug 5 
and post officials announced thursday that the unit was deploying 
a military term that means the troops are on alert preparing for 
movement and likely to move at any time 
fort bliss officials refuse to reveal when the unit will 
actually move

diplomats said monday that 
government troops in liberia had killed an american missionary and 
there were reports that one of liberias rebel factions had reached 
an informal truce with the government 
the missionary a baptist was killed by government troops who 
arrested him thursday according to diplomats they said the body 
of the slain man identified as clark alan jacobsen 42 of 
sterling alaska was handed over to the us embassy on saturday 
the embassy was filing a formal protest with the government the 
diplomats said they did not say why jacobsen was detained 
jacobsen traveled to liberia last september with joel poe of 
sterling as missionaries for the sterlingbased frontiers of faith 
ministries 
poe returned to alaska in october but jacobsen stayed to 
continue his mission work according to poe who said jacobsen had 
planned to return home next month 
a second american arrested and accused of fighting for the 
rebels andrew voros of new jersey was freed saturday and 
evacuated from monrovia by us marines the diplomats said 
jacobsen was the second american known to have died in liberias 
8monthold civil war which has left at least 5000 people dead 
most of them civilians 
a protestant missionary tom jackson and his british wife june 
were killed march 24 near bahn a town in northeastern nimba county 
where they had lived for years they were forced by soldiers to 
travel in a convoy that was ambushed by guerrillas loyal to rebel 
leader charles taylor 
most of the 6000 americans who had livedin liberia were 
missionaries after the deaths of the jacksons the us embassy in 
monrovia put out the first of several warnings for americans to 
leave 
meanwhile followers of rebel leader prince johnson and troops 
loyal to president samuel doe told a western diplomat they were 
prepared to join forces to resist a possible attack by rebels from 
a rival faction opposed to the truce 
those rebels led by taylor are camped out on the outskirts of 
the capital monrovia 
there was no official announcement of a ceasefire from either 
johnson or doe news of the truce was received in a radio telephone 
call from diplomats in monrovia to their embassies in abidjan 
capital of neighboring ivory coast 
the diplomat said he found afl armed forces of liberia and 
inpf independent national patriotic front troops dancing in the 
streets saying it was all over said one diplomat in abidjan he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
as part of the celebration they were throwing money into the 
air and both lots of soldiers together with some civilians in the 
streets were looting what was left in the stores the diplomat 
said 
he said there was speculation that the lower ranks of the 
military and the prince johnson rebel faction patched it up 
themselves because everybody is thoroughly fed up with the whole 
thing 
the rebellion to oust doe reached monrovia in june since then 
the city has been battered by rockets and mortars bodies litter 
the streets and all the hospitals are closed 
government soldiers and rebels have plundered shops and homes 
and beleaguered residents have been without fresh food supplies 
water electricity and telephone communication for nearly two 
months 
it was unclear if mondays truce would hold the ceasefire 
comes as west african leaders trying to halt the fighting prepare 
for a peace conference scheduled to start next week in banjul 
gambia 
taylor and doe plan to send envoys to the meeting johnson who 
split with taylor in february and formed a rival faction has also 
said he would attend 
a sixnation task force of the economic community of west 
african states was mobilizing in freetown sierra leone to sail to 
monrovia to enforce a truce 
thousands of guinean troops have been stationed on liberias 
northwestern border since taylors rebels began crossing into 
guinea to kill liberian refugees of the mandingo tribe taylors 
rebels have accused the mandingo of supporting doe

former us senator lawton chiles on 
monday released 26 years of medical records in an effort to defuse 
suggestions hes unfit to fulfill his current political ambition 
to be governor of florida 
a doctor treating chiles for depression said monday that the 
democratic candidate was never suicidal and suffered no 
disabling symptoms 
chiles 60 served three terms in the senate before announcing 
in 1987 he wouldnt seek a fourth term because of what he termed 
burnout 
chiles opponent in the sept 4 primary us rep bill nelson 
and republican gov bill martinez have released their medical 
records and urged chiles to do the same 
the records released monday showed chiles has taken 
antidepressant medication since november 1987 including the drug 
prozac which has been linked by some to suicidal thoughts 
chiles first became depressed following openheart surgery in 
1985 but that episode didnt require medication his family 
doctor karl hempel of tallahassee said monday 
hes never been suicidal from the very start said hempel 
chiles suffered a chemical imbalance causing routine depression 
with the typical symptoms he said 
i would definitely not tell him to retire said hempel he 
doesnt have anything that is even close to being disabling 
nelsons running mate state house speaker tom gustafson 
suggested two weeks ago chiles could be a suicide risk because he 
had taken prozac gustafson later apologized for the remark 
at least two former patients have sued the drugs maker claiming 
prozac caused them to attempt suicide the manufacturer eli lilly 
amp co has denied the drug has such ill effects 
chiles released an inchthick collection of medical documents 
dating back to 1966 which documented a variety of ailments 
including chronic ulcerative colitis and an arthritic spinal 
disorder 
in november 1987 a naval reserve doctor prescribed the 
antidepressant doxepin after chiles complained of insomnia loss 
of appetite and sex drive the records showed a month later 
chiles made his announcement he wouldnt seek a fourth senate term 
in a report of the evaluation dr rj pentzien a psychiatrist 
at bethesda naval hospital said chiles had no history of 
suicidal ideation plan or intent 
later chiles stopped taking medication for several months 
according to the records 
hempel prescribed prozac for chiles in december 1989 and he 
takes it now 
while campaigning monday in southern florida chiles said the 
records should put an end to questions about his health 
i think that my health is perhaps a legitimate issue chiles 
said adding that his rigorous campaign schedule proved he is fit

a gang of convicts from a siberian 
labor camp overpowered their guards aboard an aeroflot passenger 
flight hijacked the plane to pakistan and sought political asylum 
monday no one was hurt 
one of the convicts apparently smuggled weapons on board in an 
artificial limb the official soviet news agency tass reported 
the 11 hijackers surrendered after landing at karachi 
international airport and the 29 passengers and nine crew members 
were freed unharmed officials said 
it was the latest in an unprecedented spate of hijackings 
involving soviet aircraft there have been at least 13 hijack 
attempts in the past three months 
airport officials insisting on anonymity said the tupolev 154 
had only five to 15 minutes of fuel left when it landed in karachi 
the authorities did not say whether the hijackers would be given 
asylum or sent back to the soviet union 
the hijacking began sunday when 15 prisoners were aboard an 
aeroflot flight from neryungry about 3000 miles east of moscow 
where their labor camp was located the flight was bound for the 
nearby city of yakutsk in eastern siberia officials said 
it was not known why the prisoners were being taken to yakutsk 
or why they were serving time in prison 
the prisoners armed with guns and homemade explosives 
overpowered their guards and threatened to blow up the plane said 
the independent soviet news agency interfax 
the hijackers forced the plane to return to neryungry there 
six prisoners left the plane but two more joined the group 
according to soviet interior ministry spokesman yuri i arshenevsky 
of the 70 passengers left on board the hijackers allowed 41 
women and children to leave the plane in neryungry arshenevsky 
said then they flew west to krasnoyarsk in siberia where 
authorities negotiated with them for two hours and allowed them to 
refuel 
the plane next flew to tashkent in soviet uzbekistan there the 
hijackers demanded the aircraft be allowed to leave the country 
after negotiating through the night authorities allowed the 
plane to be refueled and to take off the hijackers promised to 
free the passengers and crew when they landed officials said 
karachi airport authorities initially denied the jetliner 
permission to land but relented when the pilot said he did not have 
enough fuel to fly to another destination officials said 
the airport was briefly closed but reopened to normal traffic 
after the hijacked plane landed officials said 
pakistan is an islamic country but authorities said none of the 
hijackers was believed to be moslem 
there have been at least 13 attempts to hijack soviet aircraft 
since late may mostly by soviet teenagers or young men who said 
they wanted to live in the west that compares with about 70 such 
attempts in the 57year history of aeroflot the soviet state 
airline 
at least six hijackers made it out of the soviet union but all 
were arrested soviet media emphasized that western countries have 
been returning the hijackers to the soviet union to face charges 
hijacking carries a penalty of five to 20 years in jail in the 
soviet union 
finland on monday ordered the extradition of mikhail 
varfolomeyev who commandeered a soviet plane on a domestic flight 
from the estonian capital of tallinn to the ukrainian city of lvov 
he sought asylum when the plane landed in helsinki finland 
extradited another young soviet hijacker last month 
as for mondays incident soviet authorities were trying to 
figure out how it happened 
tass quoted deputy interior minister ivan shilov as saying there 
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to 
commandeer the plane 
such a large group of prisoners should ideally be 
transported separately of course he said but chronic 
shortages of flights even for ordinary passengers prevent us from 
using a special plane 
he added that was certainly is no justification for what 
happened

a panel was appointed monday to review the use of 
prison inmates as human prey to train tracking dogs a practice 
that has drawn criticism from state legislators and others 
a prison official acknowledged taking two friends on what he 
dubbed the ultimate hunt 
both public concern and the medias attention to this subject 
warrant a serious review said charles terrell chairman of the 
texas board of criminal justice 
the practice was criticized after news reports that jerry hodge 
vice chairman of the board of criminal justice participated in the 
hunts last year with two friends and later gave them jackets 
emblazoned the ultimate hunt 
hodge has apologized for the jackets but defended his 
participation in the hunt saying the inmates were volunteers and 
werent in danger prison officials say they need to use inmates to 
teach the dogs to track prison escapees 
those on the hunt ride horses following the dogs as they track 
prisoners 
terrell is resigning as chairman sept 1 sources told the 
associated press that hodges appointment was to be announced aug 
14 the same day news of the incident became public 
gov bill clements who called hodges actions inappropriate 
denied he had chosen hodge to replace terrell clements said he 
would take the information into consideration in making his 
decision but said he didnt feel it disqualified hodge 
questions about the practice previously surfaced seven years ago 
when the lacerated body of an inmate dog boy was found drowned 
in a stock pond according to former prison board member harry 
whittington 
in 1983 a 14000 outofcourt settlement with the prison 
system was reached in a lawsuit involving two inmates that were 
attacked by dogs one man suffered more than 100 bites and the 
other 56 bites 
prison officials have said protective clothing worn by the 
inmates is designed to prevent injury medical records show 23 dog 
bites suffered by inmates since 1987 according to prison officials

a small group took to the streets monday 
to protest the deployment of us soldiers and sailors in the 
persian gulf region 
about 15 people waved signs and lofted a banner in protest of 
the us policy in the middle east at a busy intersection in north 
kingstown where president bush made a campaign stop on behalf of 
republicans gov edward d diprete and rep claudine schneider 
the president never saw the demonstrators who took up a post 
that his motorcade didnt pass they moved their protest to 
downtown providence later in the afternoon to catch the rushhour 
crowd passing in front of the federal building 
us troops out of the middle east no war for the oil 
companies and wall street money for jobs homes schools at home 
not war abroad their banner said 
they likened the deployment of thousands of us troops planes 
and ships intended to protect saudi arabia and block trade with 
iraqs because of the iraqi invasion of neighboring kuwait to the 
early stages of the vietnam war 
were responding like in 1963 when advisers were sent to 
vietnam said bill bateman of the all peoples congress this is 
the opening shot of an antiwar movement theyre making all the war 
moves 
although he conceded it was unlikely that his small protest 
would move the united states to reconsider its policy he argued 
that us opposition to the vietnam war also started small growing 
into a nationwide movement 
they only respond when the numbers grow when the people start 
coming home in body bags he said 
another protester timothy sprouls of the rhode island middle 
east committee said he was particularly opposed to the us 
response because of the rapid buildup of forces in the gulf region 
the united states jumped in there with both feet he said 
theres been no discussion or dialogue

us rep floyd flake pleaded innocent monday to 
conspiracy fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from allegations 
he diverted money from programs of the church where he is pastor 
after the arraignment the twoterm democrat assured 250 
supporters he will be vindicated at trial 
flake 45 was indicted aug 2 on 17 counts of conspiracy fraud 
and tax evasion his wife margarett 42 was indicted on nine 
counts 
lawyers entered pleas for them at a fiveminute court appearance 
before us district judge eugene nickerson in brooklyn neither 
flake nor his wife spoke but they stood erect looking confident 
throughout the proceeding 
the judge released them in their own custody and scheduled the 
next hearing for october 
afterward flake thanked the applauding supporters as he left 
the courthouse 
i am not guilty he told them my record speaks for 
itself 
the supporters had arrived in chartered buses many were from 
the allen african methodist church in the borough of queens where 
flake is the pastor some carried signs including one that read 
come see the great work he has done 
the indictment was ridiculous for a man of his caliber said 
gregory meeks an attorney congressman flake is a great man 
hes proven it by his deeds said another demonstrator who 
identified himself only as tony 
flake who represents new yorks 6th congressional district was 
charged with diverting 141700 from church and housing funds for 
his own use and for failing to report it as taxable income 
the charges center on the 300unit allen senior citizens 
apartments which flakes church built in 1981 with a 10 million 
federal loan 
the church operates the complex with a 100000 monthly subsidy 
from the department of housing and urban development the 
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987 the flakes embezzled 
75000 from the complex 
us attorney andrew maloney said the money was siphoned off in 
6000 increments from quarterly hud allocations of 9000 set 
aside for transporting the elderly residents to and from 
appointments in the neighborhood he said the actual transportation 
costs were only 3000 a quarter 
the indictment also alleged that flake took another 66700 from 
a special church ministerial expense fund for his own use 
between 1983 and 1988 and again did not report the money as 
taxable income 
maloney said church members were unaware of flakes activities 
when he was indicted flakes attorney gustave newman said the 
money was used for church purposes and the charges wouldnt stand 
up in court 
he also said the case would not affect flakes plans to run for 
a third term this year 
mrs flakes attorney ted wells said his client was only a 
secretary the person who signed tax forms and checks he said she 
had no substantive involvement in church operations 
the charges included one count of conspiracy two counts of 
fraud and six counts of tax evasion against each of the defendants 
flake was additionally charged with another four counts of filing 
false tax returns and four counts of making false financial 
statements 
if convicted on all 17 counts flake would face a maximum of 87 
years in prison and fines of up to nearly 4 million his wife 
would face maximum penalties of 55 years in prison and 21 million

pentagon official said aug 15 
one of the ground rules prevents journalists from disclosing the 
size of troop units or where they are located in the desert in the 
dispatches that are shared with the nations news media on a 
pool basis 
thats the kind of stuff the iraqis would love to know you 
might as well be giving them grid coordinates to set their 
artillery for said the official who is helping to handle the 
pool coverage from washington he asked to remain unidentified 
another restriction on the 15member pool of us journalists 
flown to saudi arabia by the pentagon prohibits them from 
identifying individual soldiers except commandlevel officers 
by name 
that rule is in place to protect the gis families in the united 
states the pentagon official said 
you have people who dont much care for the fact that were 
there in the first place and who want to strike back at a target 
he said 
allowing the journalists to report how many troops are gathering 
at a certain spot would be giving the enemy the potential enemy 
information that is better left unsaid at this point the 
official said 
photographers are not prevented from taking pictures of anything 
they see but a group of us military escorts control where 
the pool reporters and photographers are taken each day 
if they are taken to an object or a human being they are not 
being prevented from taking pictures of anything the official 
said 
a military official does a security review of the stories 
before they are dispatched to the reporters washington bureau 
then a pentagon official in washington gives it a final review 
before it is allowed to be distributed by wire services and to 
other news organizations 
abcs sam donaldson accidentally violated the rules by 
specifying the location of an airbase used by us warplanes and 
got a warning from his us military escort 
he made an honest mistake and hasnt repeated it abc news 
vice president robert murphy said of donaldsons goof it occurred 
aug 15 during his live nightline report from the airbase in 
saudi arabia 
abc said a tape of his report with the location electronically 
bleeped out aired the next night on primetime live which 
donaldson coanchors with diane sawyer 
the pool in saudi arabia includes seven print reporters from the 
associated press the los angeles times the scripps howard news 
service the milwaukee journal united press international reuters 
and time magazine 
it also includes a national public radio reporter still 
photographers from the ap upi and time and a cnn television crew

journalists and others who fled 
kuwait after the iraqi attack told stories of wandering in the 
desert while trying to elude the invading army 
stephanie mcgehee an american stringer for the associated 
press was in a convoy of cars that fled aug 17 after britons and 
americans were ordered to gather at two kuwait hotels 
it was a hectic rather perilous drive past iraqi checkpoints 
and through uninhabited desert regions between kuwait and saudi 
arabia mcgehee of leucadia calif said by telephone from the 
khafji border post 
she and other foreigners decided to take their chances in the 
desert rather than risk becoming hostages in baghdad 
mcgehee who had lived 12 years in lebanon and kuwait said she 
donned a black floorlength robe of the sort worn by kuwaiti women 
and used her knowledge of arabic dialects to talk her way past 
iraqi troops 
it seems the iraqis got the impression the entire convoy 
comprised only arab evacuees she said i spoke at length in 
arabic with a mixture of kuwaiti and lebanese accents to the iraqis 
at the last checkpoint 
the ploy seemed to work at first and none of the other cars were 
checked but the iraqi troops suddenly told the party to return 
home 
they moved a few miles back toward kuwait then veered into the 
desert and kept driving until they saw some bedouins who pointed to 
the saudi border 
a dutch journalist who escaped from kuwait on aug 14 said she 
met others who wandered the desert seeking a way out 
they were loaded into cars buses trucks anything that 
moved said hetty lubberding a correspondent for dutch radio 
ms lubberding said her threecar convoy of british and irish 
citizens was turned back at the border crossing like thousands of 
other vehicles they then headed into the desert to meet a bedouin 
who was supposed to lead them to safety 
they had not planned to travel across the desert and so had 
brought little water or other supplies no bedouins were in sight 
and the group was soon lost unable to find their way back to 
kuwait city about 24 miles to the north 
lots of other people were wandering around lost ms 
lubberding said her convoy picked up several egyptians whose car 
got stuck 
they fell in behind some filipinos who had been pointed across 
the desert toward the saudi border by an iraqi patrol 
nerves strained they came facetoface with an iraqi tank 
having heard reports that a briton was shot trying to cross their 
first instinct was to run 
we were a little wary but we decided to approach she said 
the iraqi soldiers on the tank gave them water and pointed the 
way she said sending them to a saudi border post

western reporters are finding that 
the challenge of reporting in a society that has been virtually 
closed to foreigners until now is as daunting as working in heat 
that often soars above 100 degrees 
the saudi government allowed us defense department officials 
to chaperone a small pool of reporters in the country the week 
after the invasion it wasnt until a week later that the kingdom 
agreed to grant visas for open coverage to more than a dozen 
journalists 
habib shaheen a spokesman for the saudi government said the 
number of reporters in the country was unprecedented 
on aug 18 the saudi government flew reporters to jiddah 1000 
miles away for interviews with top officials 
ever sensitive to the draw of television the government 
arranged for nbcs tom brokaw abcs sam donaldson and cbs bob 
simon to have individual interviews with the saudi oil minister and 
the foreign minister 
very smooth donaldson pronounced after his 10 minutes with 
prince saud alfaisal the foreign minister alfaisal clad in his 
traditional flowing robe and red headdress spoke in flawless 
english as he recounted saudi arabias insistence that iraqi troops 
leave kuwait 
the saudis decision to open their borders awed some reporters 
who until now have spent years trying to penetrate the kingdom 
we would wait forever just to get one interview and now we 
have three top officials in one day said barnie mason of bbc 
radio 
the logistics for covering the news are formidable 
cnns carl rochelle was a pool reporter who flew to saudi arabia 
with defense department staff once in the country he and his 
technicians had to set up a portable satellite station at the 
dhahran air base 
the heat was so intense that one technician was overcome and 
military officials were forced to install an air conditioner in a 
tent 
weve learned to drink a lot of water said tom mote a cnn 
cameraman

the times publishing co settled a 
stock feud with texas billionaire robert m bass that company 
officials said preserved independent control of the st petersburg 
times 
the publishing company agreed to recapitalization including 
redemption of its preferred stock the parties announced in a joint 
statement aug 17 in return the bass group is dismissing its suit 
against the times 
the agreement assures the longterm independence journalistic 
control and competitive vigor of the st petersburg times as well 
as significant ongoing support for the poynter institute said 
andrew barnes chairman of times publishing 
david bonderman managing partner for the bass group 
poynterjamison ventures ltd said the settlement was in 
everyones best interest the partnership includes the nieces of 
the late eleanor poynter jamison sister of founder nelson poynter 
who ran the paper for 30 years 
we always believed this to be a good investment and are happy 
we could work with andy barnes to help end a family dispute that 
has brewed for years bonderman said 
earlier this year the bass group made a 270 million buyout 
offer for times publishing co parent firm of the newspaper 
congressional quarterly and other magazines 
the bass group owned 40 percent of the voting stock but got only 
57 percent of the dividends of times publishing co under an 
unusual stock arrangement 
the partnership sought a better return on its investment and 
maintained directors had an obligation to recall preferred stock 
as allowed by bylaws at 106 a share or 318000 
but the times defended the stock arrangement as beneficial to 
the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the health of the 
poynter institute which essentially controls the newspaper the 
institute offers education and national conferences to journalists 
and students 
as a result of the settlement the publishing company is 
incurring debt said barnes who is editor and president of the 
times the debt should not affect operations said barnes who also 
is chairman of the poynter institute and chief executive officer of 
the times holding co 
nelson poynter who ran the paper for 30 years had set up a 
unique way to keep a profitable daily newspaper in the hands of 
journalists free from control of outsiders or even his family he 
established the notforprofit journalism school which ultimately 
is the major stockholder of the newspaper 
times publishing is owned largely by times holding co which in 
turn is owned almost entirely by the nonprofit poynter institute 
for media studies 
state attorney general bob butterworth had intervened in the 
suit on behalf of the poynter institute which he said was 
threatened by the bass partnership 
butterworth said he was pleased with the settlement but 
disturbed by the agreement by the parties not to comment on terms 
or related matters 
this office will take whatever steps are available to ensure 
that the state has sufficient information to determine that the 
settlement in fact does not have an adverse impact on the poynter 
institutes beneficiaries including the state university system 
and tampa bayarea public schools he said

a san francisco examiner editorial urging 
legalization of drugs was yet another blow to the united states 
drug policy law enforcement officials say 
lets face it no amount of laws no amount of interdiction 
no amount of courts no amount of jails no amount of anything has 
reduced the craving for the use of drugs the aug 12 editorial 
read 
it said all antidrug laws should be repealed and the war on 
drugs called off 
for these people to make statements like this i think they 
are very uninformed they are making it from a philosophical point 
of view that i dont think takes into consideration those who are 
actively involved in the problem said robert bender drug 
enforcement agency agent in charge in san francisco 
in san jose where police say 80 percent of serious crime is 
drugrelated police chief joseph mcnamara said he agreed with some 
of the newspapers arguments 
many of the points in the editorial are valid mcnamara 
said the tremendous corruption the clogging of courts jails 
and prisons indicate we need to look for new solutions but i dont

a weekly newspapers campaign to get 
readers to send in coupons naming suspected criminals is being 
praised by anticrime activists and criticized as a witch hunt by 
civil libertarians 
the public service advertisements have been running in the 
30000circulation lake worth herald since july with blanks to 
fill in peoples names addresses and alleged criminal activities 
herald editor jay kravetz has forwarded eight names to the 
police since the campaign began he said he got the idea after 
reading about similar ads in other newspapers 
i wish that everybody would call the police who ran into or 
saw a crime said kravetz but they dont this is for people 
who dont want to call police 
lake worth police lt jack garson said the tips have 
supplemented some cases but have not led to any arrests 
james k green legal director of the american civil liberties 
union in florida said the practice raises some disturbing 
questions 
what kind of a society do we want to live in a society of 
informers or do we want to leave that to the police green 
asked its not the function of a free press to act as a patsy to 
law enforcement 
but supporters such as shirley m campfield of the lake worth 
concerned citizens said the coupons are an excellent 
crimefighting tool 
it has a lot to do with where lake worth is at the moment 
campfield said some aggression is called for to get us over the 
hump 
the newspaper can put pressure on police to investigate when the 
same names keep turning up she said a lot of people complain 
that they talk to the police and nothing happens

the peoria journal star popped the lid off 
tupperwares secret new product for 1990 and the plastic 
kitchenware giant is steamed 
the newspaper reported aug 15 that tupperwares revolutionary 
new product line is a group of stackable microwave dishes 
the paper really did a number on us said alan luce 
tupperware vice president for administration this was a major 
product breakthrough for us it was not like a new tumbler or 
color this was a major secret 
the new line was to have been unveiled nationally aug 27 but 
the newspaper got a reporter inside a closed session of a 
tupperware convention aug 14 when the product was introduced to a 
jubilant crowd of dealers and sales managers 
luce said the story ruined the fun surprise and excitement 
for conventioneers attending sessions later in the week in peoria 
long beach calif and orlando fla 
weve got 110000 independent tupperware dealers in the united 
states we prefer that they know about our new products before the 
general public knows said lawrie pitcher platt spokeswoman at 
tupperware headquarters in orlando 
mayor jim maloof said his secretary received several calls from 
upset tupperware officials he said he called the newspaper to ask 
if the story could be pulled from its evening editions the paper 
refused 
i dont understand whats the big deal they had news and we 
went and got it said jack brimeyer assistant managing editor 
we didnt treat them any differently than any other business or 
news story 
the mayor also said he had heard tupperware had threatened to 
cancel its threeyear contract to hold conventions in peoria 
the company plans to hold its 1991 convention in hawaii for 
tupperwares 40th anniversary but luce said that had nothing to do 
with the tupperware flap 
the new line is called tupperwave its a ninepiece selection 
of casseroletype dishes and accessories that can be stacked 
threehigh in a microwave to allow simultaneous cooking of entrees

the networks coverage of the middle east crisis 
in the week following the iraqi invasion boosted ratings for their 
evening newscasts by 19 percent and gave them a larger average 
audience than primetime entertainment shows 
the increase was due to public interest in the news from the 
middle east and us military movements there nbc research vice 
president preston beckman said aug 14 
cbs nbc and abc evening newcasts collectively averaged a 288 
rating and a 60 percent share of the audience last week compared 
with a 281 rating and 53 share for prime time programs nielsen 
audience estimates showed 
abcs frontrunning world news tonight averaged a 106 
rating the cbs evening news whose anchor dan rather has 
been in the middle east since iraqs aug 2 in invasion of kuwait 
averaged a 93 nbc nightly news ran third with an 89 average 
each ratings point represents 921000 homes the audience share 
is the estimated percentage of homes tuned to a given program in 
its time period 
abc research vice president alan wurtzel said that its rare for 
news ratings to do better than entertainment ratings he attributed 
the ratings both to viewer interest in the crisis and the summer 
doldrums in prime time viewing

doubled the newscasts were seen in 763000 homes friday night and 
659000 homes on sunday

the federal communications commission is 
investigating complaints against a public television station that 
showed nude photographs taken by robert mapplethorpe 
wgbh included the photos in a 10 pm newscast july 31 the day 
before bostons institute of contemporary art opened an exhibit of 
mapplethorpes work 
at least three people have complained to the fcc including 
donald wildman of the american family association in tupelo miss 
who sent a videotape of the broadcast to the fcc 
roger holberg an fcc attorney said the agency has not 
determined whether there is enough of a case to warrant contacting 
the station 
wgbh may be partially protected because the broadcast was after 
8 pm when the fcc does not enforce indecency rules but the 
broadcast could be investigated for obscenity which is treated 
differently under federal law holberg said 
eric brass attorney for wgbh disputed the complaints 
it just is not obscene he said i believe we have the 
right to do what we did in the context of a serious news program 
we cannot be in the position of censoring debate about censorship 
thats what it would come down to

turner broadcasting system inc said aug 14 it 
lost 44 million on the goodwill games which caused the company to 
post a secondquarter loss of 83 million 
the loss on the goodwill games masked the betterthanplanned 
performance of our ongoing operations tbs chairman ted turner 
said in a statement 
the loss included a failure to deliver audience level guarantees 
to advertisers who bought time on the tbs superstation for the 
televising of the games turner said it would provide compensatory 
advertising time for future programming on its other cable tv 
networks 
turner said during the recent games in seattle that the 
quadrennial international sporting event could lose 26 million 
twice what had been projected that fueled speculation that the 
games which turner developed in 1985 to foster better relations 
between nations might be doomed 
the first goodwill games in 1986 lost 26 million 
kitsie riggall a tbs spokeswoman maintained that it would be 
premature to say the event was finished 
weve been saying all along that the board of directors will 
review the games at a future date and will make a decision 
riggall said 
they will review these numbers as well as the games itself 
its value to the cable industry the gains it made with the 
athletic community there are several things to look at she said 
turner said earlier this month he expected the board to decide 
by the end of september whether to continue tbs involvement in the 
games

darkman 
with little fanfare and none of the intrusive hype that heralded 
batman and dick tracy a tidy comicbook fantasythriller 
from universal pictures will fill screens across the nation on aug 
24 and if youre smart youll get in line right now 
at a fraction of the budget darkman is what dick tracy 
could have been without turning over the movie to the nontalents 
of madonna and ignoring plot and action or what batman should 
have been without all the pretense and jokermania its a simple 
story of good vs evil seen through the talented lens of bill 
pope with surefire direction from sam raimi the evil dead 
and the kind of special effects you only visualize in action comic 
books 
dr peyton westlake liam neeson is on the brink of perfecting 
synthetic skin skin that can take on the features of any 
photograph fed into a computer the only problem is that when 
exposed to light the skin disintegrates after 100 minutes 
meanwhile his true love julia frances mcdormand a lawyer 
discovers a memo linking her client a real estate tycoon to the 
mob 
westlake is visited by a brutal team of hitmen who seek the memo 
and silence led by the slimey and vicious robert g durant larry 
drake who likes to snip off the fingers of his victims with his 
cigar slicer and add to his digit collection at home the killers 
bash westlake through several glass cabinets beat him shoot him 
dunk his head in a vat of acid and leave him a mangled mess after 
turning up the gas and lighting a flame to destroy their handiwork 
the explosion propels westlake through the window of his lab 
like a firey torpedo the effect is stunning 
as far as the world is concerned westlake is dead he emerges 
at the local hospital as a john doe so badly burned that the 
doctor clips a vital nerve to alleviate pain only problem the 
procedure leaves westlake with superhuman powers and a rage the 
size of texas 
he somehow manages to recreate his lab and make enough skin to 
get him through several revenge killings and then some 
westlake becomes darkman a combo phantom of the operaamazing 
hulk with the chameleon charms of his synthetic skin he can look 
like anybody 
the action is nonstop and inspired and for once a screenplay 
with five names attached isnt an abomination its plump with wit 
and pathos and has an eerie override 
the story is by raimi whose claim to fame is the evil dead 
a cannes film festival cult classic however raimi shows enormous 
talent with his kinetic camera work and angled shots and he has a 
skilled companion with pope who makes his feature film debut with 
darkman 
neeson who has given solid performances in suspect the 
mission and the good mother offers a multifaceted portrayal 
with westlake there is compassion sensuality intellect horror 
there are good support performances from drake who plays the 
retarded benny on tvs la law and is the sadistic thug in 
this movie and mcdormand the abused sheriffs wife from 
mississippi burning her genuine goodness is never cloying 
darkman is a visionary epiphany of mans inhumanity to man 
the perils of greed the tests of love and loyality it is a 
fantasy world of horror creation and destruction and its a 
fullthrottled blast of a ride 
produced by robert tapert darkman is rated r for graphic 
violence

pump up the volume 
contrary to common belief and some earnest hopes the youth 
movie is not dead the oncethriving genre makes a comeback in 
pump up the volume a watchable film of surprising energy 
adults may well need to steel themselves for another wave of movies 
based on the timeworn theme my parents dont understand me 
pump up the volume and it does is generally effective 
thanks to a highwattage performance by christian slater his 
performance before a radio microphone matches the electricity of 
eric begosian in oliver stones neglected talk radio 
slater is an easterner whose parents have moved to arizona 
where the boy is almost paralyzed with shyness at his new high 
school he tries to reach his east coast buddies via ham radio 
instead he happens on a frequency that broadcasts to his fellow 
students in arizona 
in an amazing and not altogether convincing transformation 
slater assaults the air waves with demonic fever he attacks 
parents school authorities sexual and other inhibitions for one 
frenetic hour he becomes hard harry the foulmouthed liberator of 
enslaved teenagers dispenser of heavymetal rock and outrageous 
opinions 
grownups in the peaceful suburb pay little heed until harry 
starts exposing a corrupt school administration the ruthless 
principal annie ross launches a drive to stamp out harry failing 
that she enlists the help of the fcc which dispatches a small 
army to track down harrys signal by this time he has inflamed his 
fellow students to the riot stage and has been located by a 
beautiful classmate samantha mathis who supports his cause 
allan moyle wrote and directed pump up the volume which 
exploits the assets of youth films which is mainly fresh faces and 
vibrancy he also succumbs to the liabilities especially the 
portrayal of adults as simpleminded clods or venal tyrants a few 
improbabilities remain such as how slater could hide his rantings 
from his parents in the same house 
slater who was sean connerys young companion in the name of 
the rose is electrifying as the manic harry he is one of the 
best young actors around mathis as the wouldbe friend has real 
presence though she seems too mature for high school ellen greene 
is effective as a sympathetic teacher 
the new line release was produced by rupert harvey and sandy 
stern the rating is r for raw language running time 100 minutes

the big easy credits rolled the 
lights came up and the class was full of questions was the movie 
based on fact was jim garrison really responsible for cleaning up 
louisiana how do you pronounce that strange name chopitoola is 
cajun music taught 
as in most classes a few people asked most of the questions and 
the class clown made a crack or two but there was a difference 
between this class and others at the university of southwestern 
louisiana no college kids 
the 22 students had come from around the country to lafayette 
for a weeklong elderhostel part of a national program for 
people 60 or older 
we must continue our education 66yearold douglas rowley 
said and winked 
he and his wife lila said they spent the past two winters in 
texas they came through south louisiana on their way home last 
winter and wanted to see more of the area 
they looked in elderhostel incs fat tabloid catalog 
elderhostels are given in every state and canadian province and 
numerous countries overseas and found the right combination of 
time place and subject in lafayette 
weve known about them for three or four years but this was 
the first time we were finally motivated enough to try one said 
mrs rowley 
the classes were an odd gumbo of topics cajuns and creoles in 
louisiana films louisiana architecture mississippi river customs 
and geology and the cajun waltz and twostep 
thats often the case in elderhostels 
you can go for example to connecticut college in new london 
and study psychological portraits of american presidents dantes 
inferno and country dances of old england 
elderhostels try to schedule a variety of topics preferably 
divided among science and arts and humanities said cynthia trahan 
administrative director for usls program 
there are some exceptions the elderhostel timed to coincide 
with the festivals acadiens focuses on cajun food cajun music and 
dancing and louisiana arts and crafts the mardi gras elderhostel 
describes the history of carnival and its various traditions 
tuition at louisiana elderhostels ranges from 210 to 265 the 
classes bring instructors and the schools a little money but not 
riches trahan said 
many elderhostels put their students up in dormitories but usl 
uses part of the tuition to pay for rooms in a motel shuttling 
students back and forth in vans 
john and corabeth or jack and bess fuller of houston liked 
that i always look for two or less to a room and a private 
bath said mrs fuller 72 i look at the subject carefully 
but if you stay in cabins with six people to a room she shook 
her head 
fuller 69 said he was particularly interested in the daylong 
tour of the mississippi river and in the descriptions of cajun life 
and culture 
they learned that cajuns are the descendants of french canadians 
whom the british kicked out of what was called acadia in 1755 
they also learned that the movie belizaire the cajun is as 
teacher mathe allain put it a fairy tale that inaccuracies in 
blaze include having someone as handsome as paul newman play 
gov earl k long and that a pair of dams in central louisiana is 
all that keeps the mississippi river from changing course and 
leaving new orleans on a mud flat 
as for the big easy allain told the class its plot wasnt 
based on any particular case garrison was a district attorney 
rather than the judge he played in the movie and was known best for 
his investigation of john f kennedys assassination and that 
there arent a lot of formal lessons in cajun music 
one detail tripped her up she spelled tchoupitoulas street 
correctly but pronounced it choopitoola rather than the 
choppuhtoolis heard in new orleans 
it does throw outsiders she said

while most college students spend their time at school waiting 
for summer breaks some of their parents and grandparents are 
spending vacations back in class 
elderhostel programs are patterned after european youth hostels 
in which travelers can live in groups and are offered at more than 
1500 schools worldwide to people aged 60 and over 
what elderhostel shows is that learning really doesnt ever 
end said william washington special programs director at 
cranbrookkingswood school in bloomfield hills mich 
cranbrookkingswood is one of 30 programs in michigan 
while some michigan schools offer courses yearround about 75 
percent of the older students attend classes from june to august 
people are living healthier more active lives and this is a 
program that helps them do that said lynn kindel state director 
at elderhostels central michigan university headquarters 
cady goldberg public relations director for the elderhostel 
national headquarters in boston said the program transcends the 
stereotypical activities that have previously been assigned to the 
retirement years like bingo and bowling 
kindel said there are no educational prerequisites all you 
need to be is interested and active 
the program started in 1975 under marty knowlton a social 
activist who once drove an ambulance in the french foreign legion 
and david bianco director of residential life at the university of 
new hampshire 
programs started on five new hampshire campuses with 200 
participants by 1980 the program had reached all 50 states 
about 220000 people signed up for 198990 sessions worldwide 
kindel said 
kindel said older students often are more challenging for 
teachers than traditional college students 
elderhostelers are going to say we dont believe you 
because they were around when history was being made he said

edna green devoted her life to education 
retiring nine years ago as head of the science department at a 
public high school for gifted girls 
today she is back in school a student this time under a 
program at the university of pennsylvania that permits retirees to 
audit courses in exchange for volunteer work they also are asked 
to contribute 50 per semester to a scholarship fund 
retirees can audit anything from poetry to engineering courses 
they also can use the gymnasium and pool and receive other student 
benefits such as reduced theater rates 
they volunteer as tutors counselors techincal assistants 
office and library assistants 
last semester green took courses in speech sculpture and 
poetry and shes looking ahead to the fall schedule she 
volunteered at the campus information center 
the 9yearold senior associates volunteering valuable years 
program at penn grew out of a trend that began in the 1970s when 
retired teachers sought ways to stay intellectually active without 
the pressures and expenses of enrolling in degree programs 
other programs still going include prime timers at 
california state university learning in retirement at duke 
university in north carolina and the senior adult program at 
phoenix college in arizona 
the special slant at penn is getting seniors involved in all 
aspects of campus life even as living textbooks for history 
students said nancy ellis associate director for education at the 
center for the study of aging at penn 
as an american history requirement for example bruce kuklick 
has students interview people who lived through the great 
depression world war ii and the new deal 
the 200 senior associates for this year came from teaching 
engineering and business backgrounds they range in age from 62 to 
over 90 but the majority are in their 70s 
the program began in 1981 when norton shapiro a federal 
government retiree who was auditing courses suggested an 
organization for retirees on campus ellis said 
until 1986 shapiro chaired savvys steering committee which 
meets monthly during the academic year to organize activities 
initially the program was strictly academic said green who 
earned her masters degree in biology at penn 
the volunteer business didnt come until later when we thought 
we ought to give something back to the university for what they 
were giving us she said 
but ellis said the seniors wanted to be real contributors 
we do not want to stuff envelopes we dont want to file in 
somebodys back room and we dont want to do menial tasks ellis 
said also we dont want to take projects away from the graduate 
students were not interested in being free help at somebody 
elses expense

selfdefense against oldage stereotypes is the 
main skill people require as they grow old in this country and 
those not yet retired must recognize a need to wholly abolish the 
mischievous idea that after a fixed age we become different 
impaired or nonpeople contends a new book 
as an old person you will need four things dignity money 
proper medical service and useful work says author alex comfort 
they are exactly the things you always needed as things are 
today you wont get them but there is no divinely ordered reason 
why you should not so either set out now to see that you do get 
them or work to force society to change its posture or do both 
comfort born in 1920 originally published much of the book in 
1976 under the title a good age the revised and updated 
version in paperback from crown publishers inc is called say 
yes to old age 
it details the stereotypes our society assigns to its older 
members suggests how to develop positive attitudes toward aging 
and details many notable people from actor george burns to french 
president charles de gaulle to architect frank lloyd wright who 
achieved great things in later life 
what is unique in our culture is that older people are made 
arbitrarily roleless says comfort some avoid this because 
people are more sensible than society but it is the accepted 
pattern 
to change things he suggests it becomes necessary to lie down 
on the tracks and say stop 
the new old will be more willing i think to do this than are 
the now old when the now old were young even in the early days of 
labor unions protest was less an organ of orderly political change 
than it is today 
by the year 2010 about 14 percent of the us population is 
expected to be 65 or older unless we are old already the next 
old people will be us the book says whether we go along 
with treatment now meted out to those who are now old depends upon 
how far society can sell the bill of goods it sold them 
this treatment it contends relies on two principles the 
unpeople principle and the expendable people principle 
when women were expected to faint at the sight of blood or 
black people to be amiable uncle toms some did and were now that 
those rules are seen to be demeaning or ridiculous they dont and 
arent the trouble with the part we assign to the old is 
that it is the destructive part they are supposed to be physically 
and intellectually infirm slow on the uptake and rigid in their 
ways 
aging as a physical problem is real but old age as it is 
now sold is an imaginary state which need exist only as long as we 
believe it does and impose it on people by all kinds of economic 
and social pressures 
we cant take the pain out of the facts that humans arent 
immortal or indefinitely diseaseproof or that illnesses 
accumulate as we age comfort says 
on the other hand he says at another point you need not 
count on illness or decrepitude your memory sexuality activity 
capacity for relationship and zest should normally last as long as 
you do last in a majority of people 
other sample comments 
the chief reasonable fears are of ill health of poverty of 
being the victim of attack or robbery of falling and of becoming 
ill while alone unreasonable fears fears that is laid on us by 
oldage role prescription include fear of losing grip on memory 
of being a burden of making demands and of losing our dignity by 
insisting on public entitlements for which we have paid 
the word senile is less a diagnosis than a term of abuse 
there is no change in the ability of healthy people to learn 
up to and beyond the ninth decade of life using the mind 
preserves it 
the commonest cause of sexual nonfunction at all ages is 
performance anxiety 
if the last sounds vaguely familiar this is the same alex 
comfort who wrote the bestseller joy of sex when todays 
retirees were young

retirement income for many older women is 
falling significantly behind benefits received by older men 
according to a study and congressional testimony 
by the year 2000 more than 62 percent of american women are 
expected to be in the labor force the percentage is expected to 
rise throughout the 21st century 
but as the number of women workers rises so does poverty among 
retirees especially among retired women living alone specialists 
in the problem say 
a study by the older womens league contends the problem lies 
not with social security income but with private pensions 
in 1970 according to the study women received 70 percent of 
the social security benefits received by men by last year this had 
increased to 73 percent 
but the report says that while private pension income paid to 
women in 1974 was 73 percent of that paid to men by 1987 that had 
fallen to 54 percent 
the study said that nearly 75 percent of older americans living 
below the poverty line are women of all older women 41 percent 
live in near poverty it said 
other findings 
almost four times more widows live in poverty than do wives of 
the same age 
half the widows who are now poor did not live in poverty 
before their husbands died 
in 1988 almost half the women 65 or older were widows 
convening a recent hearing of the house subcommittee on 
retirement income chairman william j hughes dnj said 
although our mothers wives and daughters are spending more time 
in the labor force poverty among older women is projected to 
continue to grow well into the next century 
louise crooks immediate past president of the american 
association of retired persons contended that women are at risk 
because they outlive their spouses are more likely to live alone 
and are more likely to have little or no private pension income and 
a lowwage history 
because women have tended to enter and leave the work force more 
often than men as a group they receive lower social security and 
private pension benefits then men other witnesses said 
ms crooks said that this is largely due to the responsibilities 
of caring for children most often assumed by women 
lou glasse president of the older womans league said the 
social security system is best at accommodating the needs of 
families that consist of a lifelong breadwinner a lifelong 
homemaker and children 
less than 10 percent of american families fit that definition 
today and even fewer will fit this mold in the future she said 
but other witnesses said social security at least provides an 
income floor for older women and that the real problem lies with 
their eligibility for private pensions 
many women receive no pensions because they tend to work in the 
service industry or for smaller firms that do not provide them 
hughes said that if an elderly couple is living on the husbands 
pension and he dies first the wife generally receives only a 
fraction in survivors benefits

grace jordan retired 33 years ago to a 
riverside she named donrovin but at 94 she acts more like the 
title of her favorite soap opera the young and the restless 
intellectually curious unabashedly positive and suprisingly 
spry this tiny woman is a testament to the aphorism taped to her 
kitchen wall you cant help aging but you dont have to grow 
old 
mrs jordan is believed to be the oldest graduate of dale 
carnegie training completing a 14week course when she was 93 she 
drove until she was 92 at 90 she was still taking aerobics 
classes 
mrs jordan has been slowed recently by fading vision but she 
had no trouble climbing the steep slope leading to her pier that 
juts into the clear water of the lower corrotoman river 
as a tender spring breeze caressed tendrils of silver hair 
streaming below her straw hat she sat at the end of the pier and 
expounded on her philosophy of life 
joy in the heart pleasure in the mind a body free of pain 
if you have that you can be happy all day she said 
but one has to begin with an enthusiastic embrace of life 
he who wakes at dawn with enthusiasm may expect satisfaction 
at sunset mrs jordan said 
youth is enthusiastic and old age likes to sit its crazy to 
do nothing theres no enthusiasm in nursing homes theyre just 
sitting around life is over theyre just waiting for the end 
have something to look forward to she advised before i 
go to sleep at night i plan what i want to do the next day 
youve got to keep the mind active and exercised 
mrs jordan never went to college and quit high school after 2 
years but she has taken correspondence courses in english grammar 
sewing dress design flower arranging interior decorating 
landscaping astrology and oil painting many of her paintings hang 
in area restaurants 
all my life ive been seeking truth she said ive read 
every book i could get my hands on if i can get one new idea out 
of a book i consider it worth the price 
after leaving school at 16 the richmond native went to work in 
a dry goods store for 4 per week she later learned bookkeeping 
and in 1918 began a career in that field 
her lifelong love of learning was the reason she took the dale 
carnegie course in effective speaking and human relations i 
might get something to think about she said 
as it turned out she gave her 34 classmates something to think 
about said instructor buck stahl 
a deep respect grew from all classmates for her stahl said 
when she got up to speak you could hear a needle drop people 
didnt even squirm in their seats she was an inspiration to all of 
us 
lillian taylor a spokeswoman for dale carnegie amp associates 
inc in new york said mrs jordan is believed to be the oldest 
gradute of a carnegie course more than 3 million people have 
graduated from the personal development courses since 1912 she 
said 
in addition to intellectual exercise mrs jordan is an avid 
believer in keeping the body active 
she isnt participating in an organized exercise program at the 
moment but follows a home exercise routine 
loading a cassette into her tape player she placed a 
5footlong wooden rod over her shoulders and started waltzing 
slowly pulling the rod down her back the exercise keeps the chin 
out of the navel said the 5foot woman only slightly bowed by 
her years 
her husband died in 1979 and she has no children but mrs 
jordan said she doesnt get lonely 
i would if it wasnt for the fact ive learned how to accept 
what is im interested in life and learning and getting ahead 
another secret to her long and productive life she said is 
i dont worry at all 
she said she learned long ago to turn problems and low periods 
into growth experiences 
after each problem worked itself out i had learned a lesson i 
was either a little bit stronger a little bit wiser or had more 
selfconfidence

ailing plants usually provide clues as to whats 
wrong often just asking why youre concerned points to the 
solution sometimes a little luck helps too 
as an example of such luck i wanted purpleflowering texas sage 
leucophyllum frutescens for an informal 6foot hedge to hide a 
cementblock wall six of seven took hold beautifully the laggard 
seemingly had an identical start and care naturally it was the 
middle one 
i checked things like drainage watering and insects and even 
considered genetic differences it turned out to be a live wire 
our gray kitten of that name was discovered rolling on the 
center plant several times a day a chickenwire enclosure diverted 
wire to such fruitless pursuits as chasing hummingbirds until he 
forgot about the bush the hedge soon filled in 
fortunately most plant problems fall into more routine 
channels but its wise to never assume anything and to check 
everything keep notes eliminate possible causes methodically 
bark splitting leaves yellowing is the entire plant affected 
or just one side has the decline been sudden or over a period of 
time how does adjacent vegetation look are insects obvious is 
just one plant in trouble or do similar ones show the same 
symptoms was it planted too deeply or shallowly 
asking such questions usually pinpoints the trouble or provides 
sufficient information for someone more knowledgeable to suggest 
the cure even without seeing the plant 
start by making sure what concerns you isnt normal for a 
certain time of year leaf drop in the fall is expected from 
deciduous plants it can be worrisome from evergreens anytime 
however evergreens routinely replace some leaves and many drop 
lots of them at certain seasons if the remaining leaves look ok 
the plant probably is healthy 
if there is a persistent premature leaf drop check watering 
practices first a sprinkler system may produce a fine lawn but it 
seldom supplies sufficient moisture for trees and shrubs 
these days with drought and water rationing occasional deep 
watering becomes even more important to avoid shallow roots and 
declining tree and shrub vigor but remember also that excess water 
kills a plant as easily as extreme dryness 
wilting foliage can be an early symptom of either probe into a 
few inches of the soil with a trowel a soil augur or try 
inserting a longblade screwdriver this may supply the answer 
if not whats adjacent to the plant an alley swimming pool 
driveway a patio the neighbors yard whats happened recently a 
cement expansion that may have damaged roots or changed drainage 
swimming pool overflowed lawn fertilized with possible excess 
amounts chemical spills 
are underground animals a possibility a neighbors collection 
of agaves was ruined by gophers who ate the succulent stems before 
their tunnels were noticed 
a general yellowing of all leaves can be caused by lack of 
fertilizer extreme sunlight or high temperatures if only older 
leaves are affected it could be lack of nitrogen or potassium 
soil high in salts or poor soil aeration 
yellowing of youngest leaves suggests lack of iron or chemical 
damage marginal burning usually is traced to salinity 
plants under stress seem to attract insect pests honeydew on 
leaves indicates sucking insects large numbers of ants may be 
another clue of their presence 
which side of the plant showed symptoms first and when have a 
soil sterilant or vegetationkilling chemicals been used under or 
around the plant within three or four years some persist in the 
soil for years but are not picked up by a plant until roots grow 
into the area 
how long have you had the plant even with the best care and 
most favorable growing conditions many cant be expected to 
survive more than a year or two 
if the worst happens and the plant dies the roots and the soil 
surrounding them may tell why a bad odor often means the soil was 
kept too wet limited root development may indicate the same 
make it a practice to water in the morning so foliage dries 
before dark deeply and infrequently normally is best in general 
moist conditions favor plant diseases 
among the easiest problems to solve are things like tiny red 
flowers suddenly appearing on a rosebush that normally has large 
yellow flowers or poorquality lemons appearing on an orange tree 
trace the branch with the offtype fruit or blooms and usually 
it will be growing from below the graft a noticeable bulge in the 
main trunk around ground level 
such offgrowth called a sucker must be removed it comes 
from the rootstock which normally is much stronger than the top 
growth unless pruned the inferior but stronger suckers take over 
the plant

older californians are spending less time 
in hospitals and undergoing fewer major surgeries according to a 
medicare review 
medicare patients 65 years and older are being moved out of 
hospitals and into nursing homes and home health care settings 
earlier and more frequently said jo ellen ross chief 
executive officer of california medical review inc a nonprofit 
organization that contracts with the federal government to monitor 
medicare services 
as a result more federal resources should be spent on health 
care outside hospitals she said 
the shift corresponds to a national trend toward lower 
hospitalization rates among the elderly but it can create 
financial strain for the elderly according to experts who note 
that medicare does not pay for much of the care provided in private 
homes or elsewhere 
about 32 million californians over 65 receive medicare 
coverage but many supplement the coverage by private insurance or 
outofpocket payments 
the number of california medicare recipients admitted to 
hospitals dropped about 45000 from 1987 to 1989 although the 
number of elderly people served by medicare during that period 
increased by nearly 110000 according to the report which was 
issued last month 
surgery rates dropped nearly 11 percent in the 12 months after 
doctors were required in april 1989 to get permission from cmri 
before performing a number of major surgical procedures the report 
said 
the changes have saved taxpayers 114 million 
some physicians complain that they have to fend off pressures 
from hospitals to discharge medicare patients because hospitals are 
paid a flat rate for certain types of care but ross said studies 
show that rarely occurs

opec said monday there was not enough 
support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider 
saudi arabias request to boost oil production 
a brief statement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries said its president algerias sadek boussena would meet 
with some other oil ministers before the end of the month to 
discuss the situation it did not elaborate 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer said saturday his 
country would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels 
a day with or without the support of opec 
he had urged the cartel to hold a special session to try to take 
measures to bring down oil prices which have soared because of the 
middle east crisis 
but the statement issued by opecs headquarters in vienna said 
that an extraordinary meeting of the opec conference has not been 
able to secure the necessary support of seven of the groups 13 
members 
an extraordinary meeting of the opec conference will 
consequently not be held the statement said 
but it said boussena would meet with other ministers because of 
the situation in the oil market and to reflect the organizations 
serious concern 
saudi arabias pledge to increase its production by as much as 2 
million barrels a day would make up about half of the crude lost to 
world markets because of the international embargo on oil shipments 
from iraq and kuwait 
the kingdom the worlds no 1 oil exporter was pumping about 
53 million barrels of oil a day at the end of july according to 
the international energy agency

they are moving up much faster than the price of crude 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude was up 32 
cents to 2895 per 42gallon barrel for september delivery in 
early trading today on the merc a leading world market for 
petroleum products 
some traders had thought petroleum prices might drop today 
because saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer promised saturday 
to boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day with 
or without the support of opec that would make up roughly half of 
the 4 million barrels per day that are kept out of the world 
markets by the embargo of oil from iraq and kuwait 
prices opened a bit lower this morning on that news but the 
market soon turned around and prices moved higher with the 
exception of natural gas which fell in early trading from 1440 
to 1425 per 1000 cubic feet on september futures 
wholesale heating oil was up 136 cents to 8190 cents per 
gallon for september delivery 
basically what were seeing here is very frenetic and choppy 
trading said jerry samuels a vice president with shearson 
lehman brothers inc 
the merrill lynch vice president said the prices of refined 
petroleum products were moving higher much faster than crude prices 
because of fears of supply problems 
for example he said no one knows what will become of kuwaiti 
facilities that supply refined products in europe 
traders have also expressed concerns of supply problems in the 
united states because three modern kuwaiti refineries have been 
taken out of the market by the embargo many of the worlds 
refineries that could boost output are not equipped to produce 
petroleum products that meet us requirements

we almost feel like were being picked on because were

of showing that no other management efforts would be likely to 
succeed in reversing the news losses rill said 
thus he found that the news is not a failing newspaper under 
the law

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states dipped by five this week to 987 according to a 
widelywatched index of drilling activity released monday 
baker highes inc an oil toolmaker said its count had climbed 
by 26 to 992 a week ago in the two previous weeks before that 
increase the count had dropped by a combined 56 rigs a year ago 
this week the count was 903 
the houstonbased company has kept track of the rig count since 
1940 the count represents the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil not those producing oil 
ike kerridge a vice president at baker hughes said monday he 
was not sure why the count dropped slightly this week but he added 
he expected the count to increase if the middle east crisis 
continues to push oil prices higher 
there is a time lag price changes are not immediately 
reflected in the rig count kerridge said 
oil is just one half of the rig count he noted the other 
factor is natural gas and those prices are still depressed 
if oil prices are looking like theyre going to stay higher 
there probably will be an increase soon he said if i had to 
guess id say two to four weeks 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states texas gained seven rigs 
michigan louisiana kansas and pennsylvania each gained two more 
rigs 
states reporting declines for the week include new mexico down 
eight colorado down five oklahoma down four and ohio down 
three north dakota and wyoming each lost one rig

cockroaches might prefer to starve 
to death than scurry anywhere near powerful repellents that 
researchers hope can be used to build roachproof homes and 
businesses 
richard brenner has spent six years creating a deterrent to 
cockroaches as an entomologist for the us department of 
agricultures gainesville fla research lab 
he has worked with air vent inc of peoria heights to develop 
the repellents and a deadly new bait that someday might provide 
owners of infested homes and businesses a lethal onetwo punch for 
controlling the pesky insect 
theres no silver bullet to do the job of cockroach 
eradication brenner said no single solution will ever solve 
cockroach problems 
but were coming up with some things that will prevent 
infestation and eliminate the growing number of health problems 
weve linked to cockroaches 
the products resulted from a twoyear research project funded by 
air vent 
mike daniels national sales manager for air vent envisions 
putting the repellent in insulation and other construction 
materials 
and air vent is ready to market the bait as part of a new attic 
ventilation system designed with brenners help that is designed 
to drive roaches out of attics 
brenners research has determined that cockroaches often enter a 
home through roof vents and small openings the insects prefer 
warm moist dark environments to breed and find attics ideal 
because of the static air 
other ideas for the repellents include using them on cardboard 
boxes that carry food and attract roaches when they sit in 
warehouses and storerooms 
the repellents are five years from receiving epa approval for 
sale to the public brenner said but the attic ventilation system 
and bait could reach the marketplace within a year he said 
the investment may be worth the wait brenner estimates that 
15 billion is spent each year on pesticides to kill cockroaches 
another benefit of the research was brenners discovery that 
cockroaches are responsible for serious allergy problems 
his study found cockroaches produce allergens that affect an 
estimated 10 million to 14 million people he said the cockroach 
allergens are the second most common allergy causer among 
asthmatics 
we need to design more insectresistent structures and 
eliminate infestation by cockroaches brenner said thats why 
were excited about these products we are making some progress

atlantic richfield co said monday it will 
keep a 12day freeze on gasoline but raise prices for diesel and 
jet fuel 
arco had heeded a call 12 days ago for oil companies to control 
prices during the middle east crisis the company had included 
diesel and jet fuel in the freeze announced aug 8 
but george h babikian president of arco products co a 
marketing and refining division said arco cannot continue the 
freeze on diesel and jet fuel prices in the face of sharp 
differences in marketplace prices between arco and its 
competitors 
arco has also been forced to augment jet fuel supplies with 
purchases on the spot market at high prices babikian said in a 
statement 
babikian said the gasoline freeze was being reviewed daily the 
company said it was encouraging dealers to show restraint in 
setting prices and urged drivers to reduce use of gasoline during 
the crisis 
president bush on aug 8 asked oil companies to do what they 
could to hold down gasoline prices following iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
arco receives most of its crude oil from alaska and not the 
middle east

soybean and wheat futures prices closed modestly 
lower monday while corn ended mixed in a quiet session on the 
chicago board of trade 
rainy weather in the midwest weighed on the soybean market and 
limited gains in corn analysts said 
all in all it was a dull nondescript day said victor

division of dean witter reynolds inc 
soybeans traded in a narrow range from 624 to 634 a bushel 
for the contract for november delivery 
lespinasse said the lower 630 range has been established as an 
area of considerable resistance for soybeans when market bulls 
were unable to rally the november contract beyond 634 many 
turned sellers and pushed the market back down 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 1 cents lower with 
the contract for september delivery at 281 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with september at 252 a bushel 
oats were cent lower across the board with september at 116 a

russias foreign economics minister said monday 
the soviet unions largest republic would like to join opec 
viktor yaroshenko told a news conference that the republic 
considered itself free to join such organizations because of its 
assertion of independence of central soviet control the republics 
parliament has decided that it and not soviet authorities 
control the resources on russias territory 
we are prepared to enter as one of the members of opec now 
perhaps as an observer but in the future if we are accepted to 
enter fully yaroshenko told reporters gathered in russias 
supreme soviet chambers 
it wasnt clear how the 13member organization of petroleum 
exporting countries would respond to an application if it received 
one the cartel produces a substantial portion of the wests energy 
needs 
the russian government is now headed by ivan silayev a 
reformminded leader who works closely with boris n yeltsin the 
republics president 
they are trying to generate foreign currency to help solve dire 
economic problems and the republics oil is one potential revenue 
source 
most of the soviet unions oil is located in russia the country 
as a whole produces about 121 million barrels daily making it one

general motors corp said monday it will give the 
united auto workers union a contract offer later this week designed 
to make the union pick the automaker as the target company for 
nationwide negotiations 
gm vice president alfred warren the companys chief labor 
negotiator disclosed its intentions in his first meeting with the 
press since the opening of union talks on july 18 he didnt 
specify a day or give further details about what the no 1 
automaker would offer 
we would always rather lead than follow he said it seems 
only appropriate that we would go first 
contracts covering more than 450000 workers at gm ford motor 
co and chrysler corp expire sept 14 contributing to a growing 
sense of urgency in an industry that has been troubled by a slow 
economy and foreign competition 
on aug 28 after a uaw leadership conference in detroit the 
union is expected to choose one of the three automakers as a target 
for further negotiations 
historically an agreement reached with the target company 
becomes a pattern for the other automakers each company prefers to 
be the unions target because it provides the opportunity to 
bargain a contract with more flexibility toward that companys 
needs 
shortly after talks opened between the union and each of the big 
three negotiators broke into subcommittees to address specific 
contract issues such as job security health care costs and time 
off 
warren said work in those subcommittees has helped form the 
companys proposal but another aspect in formulating the proposal 
was the companys desire to be the target company he said 
meanwhile uaw president owen bieber goes to the main bargaining 
tables at ford on wednesday and chrysler on thursday he was at gm 
on monday to remind bargainers that 25 days remain before the 
current contracts expire 
i had hoped that they would have had a proposal out by this 
time he said it hasnt been forthcoming i expect well see 
one in the next few days which ought to be one that is not a 
starter proposal 
warren said monday he would fulfill that wish late this week a 
spokesman for ford who declined to be identified said his companys 
initial proposal was due thursday chrysler spokesman lee sechler 
said he knew of no timetable for such a proposal

billion agreement that refinances the companys existing debt 
company officials announced monday 
the transaction also will enhance the companys ability to

ounce of gold closed at 41010 up 50 cents from friday later 
republic national bank quoted an afterhours bid of 40925 up 75 
cents as of 4 pm edt 
traders said much of the dollars advance was due to investors 
selling positions they held in other currencies in exchange for the 
us currency in order to take a profit 
the market was stretched to the point of a need for a 
correction said lorenzo troni vice president of foreign 
exchange at painewebber international in new york there is 
always a point of profittaking 
the dollar also was boosted by president bushs strong 
statements to iraqi president saddam hussein about the fate of 
foreigners held in iraq and kuwait 
people are a little bit concerned we could be approaching a 
flashpoint in this issue said john mccarthy chief dealer at 
amsterdam rotterdam bank in new york the dollar typically is 
viewed as a safe haven in times of international turmoil 
another factor boosting the dollar was a slight weakness in the 
german mark due to trouble in the social democratic coalition 
government in east germany mccarthy said 
it demonstrate that things are not completely in order 
there he said 
but mccarthy didnt expect the dollars rebound to last he said 
the currency remains weak against other major currencies due to 
rising interest rates abroad which tend to support those foreign 
currencies and sluggishness in the us economy 
the dollar closed at 15641 marks in new york up from fridays 
close of 15500 marks fridays close was an alltime low for the

pound cost 19135 in new york cheaper than 19230 late friday 
in london the pound fell to 19185 from 19195 late friday

oil

late friday 
earlier in tokyo the dollar had risen to a closing 14747 yen

interco inc a footwear and furniture maker 
will ask its bondholders to exchange their bonds for 95 percent of 
the companys common stock and other consideration under a 
complicated restructuring plan announced monday 
the plan is designed to restructure the 19 billion debt that 
has plagued the st louisbased company for the past two years 
it calls for the company to undertake a 235for1 reverse stock 
split of intercos roughly 387 million shares of common stock 
issue 98 million new shares of stock and take on 202 million in 
new debt 
intercos stock closed at 31 cents a share in consolidated 
trading monday down 12 cents from friday 
most of the new shares and the new debt along with warrants to 
buy additional stock will go to bondholders in exchange for about 
900 million in current debt 
some of the new shares of stock will go to preferred 
stockholders who will be asked to convert their preferred stock to 
common stock under the plan which must be approved by the 
companys creditors 
the company reached a basic agreement with representatives of 
its creditor groups three weeks ago after a weekend of marathon 
negotiations in new york that agreement led to mondays plan 
interco has been struggling to pay off its large junkbond debt 
since it borrowed 165 billion in 1988 to fend off a hostile 
takeover attempt by corporate raiders steven and michael rales 
at the time the company made mens and womens apparel 
operated 201 retail stores such as doityourself hardware stores 
and discount clothing stores and owned footwear and furniture 
stores 
to pay off its debt the company announced plans to sell off all 
of its companies except the four it currently operates converse 
and florsheim footwear manufacturers along with furniture makers 
lane co and broyhill industries 
that plan faltered when the subsidiaries were sold for far less 
than what the company anticipated that coupled with the collapse 
of the junkbond market left interco with more debt than it 
started with 
the changes contemplated by the agreement in principle will 
resolve that burdensome situation by restructuring intercos 
balance sheet said richard b loynd chairman and chief 
executive officer

orange juice futures prices settled at their lowest levels in 
nearly eight months monday after two brazilian processors cut their 
prices for the first time since a christmastime freeze shriveled 
the florida orange crop 
on other commodity markets petroleum futures were mostly 
higher precious metals were mixed livestock and meat futures were 
mixed and grains and soybeans were mixed 
wholesale frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 195 
cents to the permitted daily limit of 5 cents lower on the new york 
cotton exchange with the contract for delivery in september down 
195 cents at 1687 a pound the lowest settlement of a nearmonth 
contract since dec 29 
mondays decline followed a plunge of 995 cents in the 
september contract on friday amid rumors that the large brazilian 
juice processor cutrala sa had slashed its preferredcustomer 
price more than 20 percent to 1813 from 2078 a pound 
cutrala confirmed the price cut on monday another brazilian 
processor citro sucro sa said it had cut its prices by the same 
amount 
the reductions were the first by the brazilians since a freeze 
last winter destroyed about 30 percent of the florida orange crop 
the freeze drove prices up sharply and forced us beverage 
companies to rely on brazil for about half of their orange juice 
needs 
the price cut was a surprise said analyst judith ganes of 
merrill lynch amp co 
it was generally expected by most industry sources that brazil 
would keep prices steadfast for at least another month or two 
until after first florida crop estimate she said 
analysts said the brazilians apparently reduced their prices in 
hopes of stimulating sales following industry reports of slumping 
orange juice consumption 
there was no sign that florida processors intend to follow suit 
esther eskansy a trader with cargill investor services inc said 
florida processors prices already were below the brazilians and 
were now close to the new brazilian levels 
ms ganes said that even if retailers decided to pass the 
savings along it could be two to three months before consumers see 
a reduction in orange juice prices 
petroleum futures continued to rise on the new york mercantile 
exchange as persian gulf tensions escalated fueling speculation 
that middle east oil shipments to the united states will remain 
restricted 
in the gulf iraq announced it had carried out a plan to move 
western hostages to vital military installations to deter any us 
attack and warned its people not to try to hide any of the 
thousands of foreigners trapped in the country

gallon unleaded gasoline was 285 cents to 428 cents higher with 
september at 10025 a gallon 
cattle futures prices fell on the chicago mercantile exchange 
as expected after the agriculture department on friday reported a 
largerthanexpected number of cattle were placed on feedlots in 
july 
thomas morgan president of sterling research co said losses 
in the nearterm contracts were limited by perceptions that fed 
cattle supplies will be relatively tight before the animals placed 
on feed in july begin to reach the market in november 
pork futures advanced led by sharp gains in the belly market 
live cattle settled 03 cent to 60 cent lower with october at 
7727 cents a pound feeder cattle were 60 cent lower to 02 cent 
higher with august at 8967 cents a pound live hogs were 05 cent

wholesale unleaded gasoline prices surged over 
the 1 mark for the first time monday boosted by what traders 
called a growing belief the middle east crisis will persist and 
create a longlasting tightness in supply 
anxiety over supplies also pushed prices up at the pump the 
american automobile association said its nationwide check of 
unleaded selfserve regular averaged 1237 a gallon monday up 21 
cents from a week earlier the average is 162 cents higher since 
the crisis erupted aug 2 aaa said 
the volatility that has beset oil trading over iraqs invasion 
of kuwait compelled the new york mercantile exchange to temporarily 
amend its rules monday to allow bigger daily price swings on 
oilfutures contracts 
the merc is one of the worlds leading markets for oil and 
gasoline products and is an important pacesetter for prices at the 
retail level 
unleaded gasoline for september delivery reached 1015 per 
gallon at one point during the mercs trading day monday the first 
time thats ever happened the price later settled for the day at a 
record close of 1003 per gallon an increase of 428 cents over 
fridays closing price 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude dipped 7 
cents per barrel to 2856 for september delivery but prices for 
later months were all up some by more than 50 cents a barrel 
more players think the crisis is going to last longer said 
annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
the market was responding partly to president bushs declaration 
that americans held in iraq and kuwait are hostages and that 
the united states holds iraq responsible she said 
some traders had predicted oil prices would drop monday on the 
news that saudi arabia promised over the weekend to boost 
production by up to 2 million barrels per day that would make up 
roughly half of the shortfall caused by the international boycott 
of oil from iraq and kuwait 
hittle said the markets might not respond to any increase in 
saudi production until they see more than verbal assurances she 
said the september contract price of crude oil might have been the 
only month to fall because traders were already starting to 
concentrate on prices for october futures with just one more day 
of trading to go on the september futures contract 
unleaded gasoline and home heating oil contracts rose quickly 
because of concerns about shortfalls said a merrill lynch energy 
futures vice president who did not want his name used 
theres a lot of tension he said the products unleaded 
gasoline and heating oil are on the way up they are moving up 
much faster than the price of crude 
home heating oil for september delivery closed at 8296 cents 
per gallon up 242 cents from fridays close the price of natural 
gas stayed sluggish monday falling from 1440 to 1417 per 1000 
cubic feet for september delivery 
the rules change at the merc will be in effect for the next 30 
days and could only become permanent following another vote by the 
board and notification of federal regulators a merc spokeswoman 
said 
there are no limits to the movements in spot prices or the 
prices for petroleum products to be delivered in the next month 
but limits are imposed on the upward or downward movements on 
futures prices for subsequent months 
under the temporary rules the limits will be expanded by up to 
1 for crude futures and 2 cents for gasoline and home heating oil 
futures 
the limits are designed to give investors an idea of their 
potential losses when each trading day begins offering them a 
degree of protection from rapidly moving markets

opec said monday it will not hold an 
emergency session to consider increasing oil production to help 
make up for the shortage caused by the mideast crisis 
but analysts predicted saudi arabia the worlds largest oil 
exporter would fulfill its pledge to boost output by as much as 2 
million barrels a day to try to steady nervous oil markets 
it is beyond assumption the kingdom of saudi arabia is 
going to increase production said peter gignoux director of the 
international energy department at shearson lehman brothers inc in 
london 
saudi arabia probably would have preferred to do it with 
opecs authorization but theyll do it agreed peter bogin 
associate director for oil markets at cambridge energy research 
associates in paris 
meanwhile venezuelan president carlos andres perez said monday 
that several opec nations with the capacity to increase oil 
production expect to meet within days despite the opec 
announcement 
perez who had previously offered to increase oil output by 
500000 barrels daily if opec agreed said his country would 
produce more oil without an opec meeting 
mondays news was greeted with generally higher prices on the 
new york mercantile exchange the september contract for west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us grade of crude was down 7 cents 
to 2856 per 42gallon barrel but later contract months settled 
higher 
the average price of a basket of crudes monitored by opec surged 
last week to 2529 a barrel surpassing the cartels newly set 
target of 21 
analysts say about 4 million barrels a day have been pulled off 
the market because of the international embargo on iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil shipments imposed after iraq invaded its tiny neighbor 
iraq produced about 31 million barrels a day in late july 
while kuwait produced 16 million barrels according to the 
international energy agency an arm of the organization for 
economic cooperation and development 
saudi arabian oil minister hisham nazer said saturday that his 
country intended to increase oil production with or without 
approval from the organization of petroleum exporting countries he 
had urged the 13nation cartel to hold an urgent meeting to discuss 
the situation 
but a brief statement issued by opec headquarters in vienna said 
a majority of members did not endorse the call 
since the proposal of saudi arabia to hold such a conference 
has not been able to secure the necessary support an 
extraordinary meeting of the opec conference will consequently 
not be held said the statement carried by opecna the groups 
news agency 
it said opec president sadek boussena the algerian oil 
minister would meet with some other ministers before the end of 
the month because of the situation in the oil market and to 
reflect the organizations serious concern it gave no details 
the algerian news agency aps quoted an unidentified source close 
to boussena as saying that three nations had joined saudi arabia 
and venezuela in supporting a special meeting it did not name the 
countries 
iranian oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh was quoted by the 
official islamic republic news agency as saying he opposed an 
immediate meeting because there was enough oil in storage in the 
industrialized world to make up for the loss 
saudi arabia which pumps about a quarter of the cartels oil 
has an opec quota of just under 54 million barrels a day 
while its production could be boosted by as much as 2 million 
barrels more a day analysts predicted venezuela could produce 
about 500000 more barrels above its current level of 2 million 
barrels to help fill the oil gap nigeria could add a few hundred 
thousand barrels to its opec quota of 16 million barrels analysts 
said 
the united arab emirates also has the capacity to lift 
production from its quota of 15 million barrels a day to 2 million 
barrels or more but bogin predicted it might be reluctant to do so 
the uae like kuwait was criticized earlier this year by 
iraqi president saddam hussein for producing more than its opec 
quota and helping drive down oil prices he claimed lower prices 
cost iraq 14 billion in oil revenues in the past year 
late last month in geneva opec ministers agreed to limit 
production to 225 million barrels a day to try to push crude 
prices up to the new benchmark of 21 a barrel by years end

york

assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega 
the impact of the trial was more than the verdict she said 
with the attention its been given for months its had an impact 
on pilots 
the felony convviction carries a maximum 15 years in prison and 
a 250000 fine however de la vega said sentencing guidelines 
called for prison terms of 12 to 18 months 
i came into this expecting the worst so in that sense i had 
no surprise said former capt norman lyle prouse who testified 
he drank up to 20 rum and diet cokes at a lounge the night before 
flight 650 left fargo nd on march 8 
the boeing 727 landed safely at the minneapolisst paul 
international airport where the pilots were arrested a customer 
who argued with one of the pilots at the lounge had reported them 
to the federal aviation administration 
prouse 51 of conyers ga 1st officer robert kirchner 36 of 
highland ranch colo and flight engineer joseph balzer 35 of 
antioch tenn each were convicted of one count of operating a 
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
us district judge james rosenbaum ordered a presentence 
investigation and released the defendants on their own recognizance 
william mauzy attorney for kirchner said he would appeal 
balzers attorney bruce hanley declined to comment and peter 
wold prouses lawyer said he was considering an appeal 
a waitress at the speak easy lounge in moorhead minn adjacent 
to fargo testified that prouse fell as he left the bar at about 
1130 pm and returned to get directions to his hotel which was 
about three blocks away 
balzer and kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer and 
left the bar about an hour before prouse according to testimony 
the plane left at 630 the next morning 
prouse an acknowledged alcoholic who entered a treatment 
program after his arrest said he had little hope of flying again 
balzer was more optimistic 
its kind of hard to keep a good pilot on the ground balzer 
said thats kind of like asking picasso if he were going to 
paint again 
the federal law against flying under the influence of alcohol 
doesnt define drunkenness as a specific bloodalcohol level as do 
many state drunkendriving laws however it suggests that a pilot 
with a bloodalcohol content of 01 percent would be impaired the 
law adopted in 1986 and amended in 1988 also applies to those 
controling commercial boats trains and passengercarrying buses 
in tests about two hours after the plane landed prouse had a 
bloodalcohol concentration of 013 percent kirchners was 006 
percent and balzers was 008 percent 
defense lawyers argued that the smoothness of the 40minute 
flight proved the pilots were not impaired 
but de la vega questioned whether they could have handled an 
emergency 
herbert moskowitz a behavioral scientist testified for the 
prosecution that as little as half a can of beer can cause delayed 
reactions 
a bloodalcohol concentration of just 003 percent cause 
significant impairment he testified 
i think it came down to the expert testimony of dr 
moskowitz the prosecutor said that was the key part of the 
trial 
jurors deliberated about nine hours on the case 
before the law was enacted pilots were covered only by faa 
regulations 
northwest fired all three pilots for drinking within 12 hours of 
a scheduled flight and the faa revoked their licenses the agency 
forbids pilots from flying within eight hours of drinking or from 
flying with a bloodalcohol content of 004 percent or more 
the three also face misdemeanor charges in north dakota
