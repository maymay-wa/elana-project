east germanys electrifying decision to open the berlin wall for 
unimpeded travel by its citizens has brought the two halves of 
germany far closer together but the two states are still a long 
way from a merger 
the two germanys have belonged to hostile eastwest camps since 
the postwar occupation following the defeat of nazi germany in 
1945 their drawing together in economic social and cultural 
matters now seems inevitable because of the remarkable changes that 
have swept east germanys communist system in recent weeks 
yet a complete reunification of east and west germany will be 
hard to achieve here are some of the reasons 
defense requirements of the soviet union and the united states 
preclude the total withdrawal of nato and warsaw pact troops from 
the germanys at present this would seem to be an essential 
precondition for reunification 
a backlash is possible from west germans particularly those 
in lowerincome groups who feel economically threatened against 
the tide of refugees this year alone authorities expect 700000 
new arrivals in west germany including 200000 east germans as 
well as ethnic germans from the soviet union and poland and 
asylumseekers from other countries 
the question remains whether east germans after four decades 
of living in a highly subsidized albeit shortageplagued economy 
will want to jettison socialism to embrace capitalism with all the 
foibles of the free marketplace 
although the west german constitution of 1949 embraces the goal 
of german unity and guarantees west german citizenship to all 
people of german descent the country already has a critical 
housing problem and faces labor tensions caused by chronic 
unemployment now at 19 million more than 7 percent with 61 
million people crowded into a country the size of oregon west 
germans are increasingly worried how this flood of newcomers will 
effect their pocketbooks 
this concern was underlined in a television comment thursday by 
a west german youth who declared in reaction to the opening of the 
berlin wall the federal republic is not a country of 
immigrants 
chancellor helmut kohl who was visiting warsaw when east 
germany threw open the barrier on thursday said west germanys 
interest must be that our compatriots stay in their homeland 
the superpowers security interests would have to be worked out 
before any complete reunfication could occur the soviets have 
upwards of 400000 troops stationed in east germany the 
cornerstone of the warsaw pact alliance and the united states has 
250000 troops in west germany 
another consideration is the european economic communitys plan 
to eliminate virtually all trade barriers in western europe in 1992 
provision would have to be made to include east germany in the 
new open border trading system although east germany already 
enjoys a privileged trading relationship with bonn 
french premier michel rochard said thursday he would not oppose 
east german membership in the eec but he advocated careful 
negotiations beforehand 
reunification could lead to the prospect of disarmament or at 
least massive cuts in german armed forces this would raise the 
issue of guarantees for germanys security and whether a powerful 
german state would settle for such assurances from other countries 
george bush and mikhail gorbachev could decide to reduce troops 
in both germanys at their summit meeting next month as a 
confidencebuilding gesture but west europeans while praising the 
sudden turn of events in east germany harbor suspicions of a 
unified germany that would be a politically and economically 
dominant force in europe 
and citizens of the soviet union mindful of its staggering 
losses in two world wars have real concern about a resurgent 
germany 
on friday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
praised east german reforms but said any speculation about a 
reunified germany is out of the question 
certainly nothing can happen before the communist elite of east 
germany permits a fundamental change free elections that could 
turn it out of government leadership this would be tantamount to 
dumping the authoritarian system that has ruled with total control 
for 40 years 
while it is true that poland and hungary have abandoned the 
leading role of the communist party in their countries the 
east german hierarchy has shown no willingness to do the same 
many of the east german opposition groups that have sprung up in 
recent weeks have emphasized that they want to preserve socialism 
not replace it with a capitalist system 
by giving citizens the opportunity to travel to the west and 
purchase goods not available at home east german leaders have 
provided a muchneeded outlet for frustrations and probably 
rescued their system from an explosion 
but a crackdown like that which ended democratic dreams in china 
last june cannot be ruled out east german leader egon krenz 
praised the chinese government for crushing the prodemocracy 
movement when he visited bejing this summer

a pregnant mother who was severely burned 
when a fighter jet smashed into a suburban apartment complex died 
friday hours after searchers found a mans body in the wreckage of 
his incinerated apartment 
navy investigators hunting through the debris for clues said 
they did not know what caused thursday evenings crash which 
engulfed three apartment buildings in flames that climbed more than 
100 feet in the air 
margie padovani 28 died of her injuries at 849 pm est said 
john hester night administrator at grady memorial hospital where 
ms padovani had been transferred with burns over 56 percent of her 
body 
the womans 5yearold daughter remained in critical but stable 
condition at grady hester said the pilot who ejected just before 
the jet crashed in a fireball into the complex thursday evening 
also remained in critical condition 
the worst part was just the sounds that little girl 
screaming said resident tamara owens 
resident bill barcus who still had a reddened face and a singed 
arm friday from facing the intense heat in an attempt to reach the 
burning woman said i got to within 10 feet of the woman but it 
was too hot and i didnt have any shoes on all i could hear were 
her screams but i had to back off i went back to get my shoes 
but by then somebody had gotten her 
the young mans body was found about 3 pm friday in the 
apartment that absorbed the heaviest damage from the crash cobb 
county medical examiner joseph burton said 
the man was identified only as white and in his 20s burton said 
there was no indication that anyone else was in the apartment 
where he said a man lived alone 
authorities did not immediately identify the resident or the 
body only one person was known to be missing prior to discovery of 
the body but the search continued four missing people were 
located earlier friday 
obviously nobody else turned up missing and that leads us 
to believe there is no one else in there said kathie barton 
smyrnas director of community relations 
the body was found in the kitchen of the last apartment in a 
building along the easternmost edge of the complex smyrna mayor 
max bacon said he was told the apartment was incinerated by 
4000degree temperatures 
about 30 people were left homeless by the fire and about 50 
others who lived in undamaged portions of the pine lake village 
apartment complex had not been allowed to return to their homes 
friday afternoon most spent thursday night at a nearby motel 
which offered free lodging 
reserve lt cmdr robert m conlyn jr of marietta the only 
person aboard the unarmed a7e corsair ii attack plane was 
reported doing better friday but remained unconscious after brain 
surgery said kennestone hospital spokeswoman laurel fredlake 
ms padovani also suffered lung damage from smoke inhalation and 
various internal injuries hester said he added that doctors had 
not pinpointed the cause of death for the woman who had undergone 
surgery thursday night to reset a broken leg 
troy kraemer ms padovanis fiance said she had been two 
months pregnant 
ms padovanis daughter jacquelyn also suffered burns over 
about half of her body said grady memorial hospital spokesman jim 
driscoll 
in other injuries a woman hurt while fleeing her apartment was 
treated for cracked ribs and a military rescue worker broke an 
ankle officials said 
firefighters extinguished the blaze about two hours after the 
626 pm crash but hot spots hampered the search thursday night 
civilian searchers were kept away through much of the day while 
navy investigators looked for clues and marine reserve guards 
helped seal off the crash site 
police officer frank durrance said the navy jet struck the edge 
of a building before crashing into a car and coming to rest by a 
chain link fence about 30 yards away you could tell it was a 
car but you cant tell that it was a plane durrance said 
barton said 12 apartments were destroyed and 20 damaged in two 
buildings three of the 32 units in those buildings were vacant 
said jim humphrey maintenance supervisor for the complex 
the jet crashed 25 miles short of the runway at naval air 
station atlanta located at dobbins air force base 15 miles 
northwest of atlanta the pilot was to land there while on a 
navigational training mission the navy said 
conlyn 37 has flown navy aircraft for 15 years on active duty 
and in the reserves he joined delta air lines in 1980 and is a 
copilot for the atlantabased carrier 
he suffered a skull fracture when his ejection seat slammed into 
a street near the apartment complex a witness said his parachute 
deployed only about 100 feet off the ground 
the commander of the naval air station capt peter hunt said 
the navy had no leads on the cause of the crash he added that the 
pilot did not report any trouble to flight controllers 
whatever happened happened suddenly hunt said 
the plane did not carry the black box flight recorder 
required on commercial airliners hunt said he said a navy review 
board would study the wreckage and maintenance and pilot records 
the navy has been beset by a string of accidents in the last 
month including a boiler fire that injured nine sailors and two 
incidents in which sailors aboard aircraft carriers were swept or 
fell into the sea two were presumed dead 
in the most deadly accident of late a jet pilot making his 
first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed into the uss lexington 
in the gulf of mexico on oct 29 killing him and four others on 
the deck of the huge ship 
on oct 30 an fa18 pilot dropped a 500pound bomb on the 
guided missile cruiser uss reeves in the indian ocean causing 
minor injuries to five sailors and blowing a 5foot hole in the 
ships bow 
two years ago an a7d corsair an earlier version of the plane 
that crashed thursday slammed into the lobby of the ramada 
innairport in indianapolis killing 10 people

the three major networks ran their evening 
broadcasts from the berlin wall but nbc anchor tom brokaw got 
there first helping nbc bounce back from its embarrassing early 
coverage of the san francisco earthquake 
on friday night abcs peter jennings and cbs dan rather were 
also on the scene to report on east germanys historic lifting of 
travel restrictions 
brokaw got there thursday night heisting a chunk of broken 
berlin wall in front of cheering berliners for a special broadcast 
and also reported friday morning for today 
jennings and rather flew to berlin after their thursday 
newscasts from new york 
its terrific terrific nbc affiliate board chairman james 
r sefert said of thursdays nbc nightly news coverage and the 
16minute latenight special 
nbc affiliates got a sixpage letter from nbc news president 
michael gartner explaining what went wrong with the networks quake 
coverage on oct 17 and what has been done to correct problems that 
arose 
although it later drew praise for its allnight coverage of the 
quake story nbc initially lagged behind its rivals with reports 
and pictures from the scene and for a time broadcast incorrectly 
that a second freeway had collapsed in the quake 
almost as embarrassing a number of nbc stations that also are 
affiliated with cable news network used cnns live quake coverage 
until nbc finally began its allout coverage from the stricken city 
those stations that turned to cnn which says it now serves 49 
nbc affiliates included wthrtv in indianapolis ind whose 
vicepresident michael j corken heads the news subcommittee of 
nbcs affiliates board 
corken who said friday hed messaged gartner and nbc president 
robert c wright that nbcs berlin wall coverage is superb 
absolutely superb said he had received gartners letter 
the gist of the letter was that a lot of things went wrong 
simultaneously and that some are fixable corken said 
in his report gartner blamed part of the delay on quake damage 
that knocked nbcs san franciscos affiliate krontv off the air 
longer than other stations thus delaying nbcs reports from the 
scene 
however he also said that i shoulder whatever blame should 
assigned for our not having our topoftheline talent readily 
available and for not ensuring that the entire staff was up to the 
task of handling an emergency 
i have made several changes in these and other areas and i am 
dedicated to ensuring that nothing like this will ever happen

the new dream of traveling west was 
the talk of bernau in this sleepy east german town just north of 
berlin the question of the hour was were you already over 
there 
this town of 12000 had its first traffic jam in history friday 
when local citizens besieged the police station for visas to the 
west 
while hundreds waited patiently for the magic paper others were 
regaling friends with tales of their wild night thursday in west 
berlin just 10 miles south 
you really missed something shouted rene a 21yearold in 
studded imitation black leather to a passing friend grapes as 
big as plums bananas pineapples absolutely unbelievable 
rene and his friend mike 19 were among the crowd that stormed 
across the bornholmer strasse crossing from east to west berlin 
that historic night 
that grinned mike was what i call fun 
back in their own town after the wildest night of their lives 
both youths swore theyd never leave east germany for good 
but the sight of western wealth along the elegant 
kurfuerstendamm had left its mark 
a different world sighed rene as he and mike surveyed their 
souvenirs of the night a west german newspaper with a screaming 
headline about the wall coming down a pack of marlboro cigarettes 
and presents from generous overjoyed west berliners 
around the corner at the besieged police station the pleasure 
of setting foot in the west was still several hours and a cold wait 
away 
many of the almost 1000 people jammed outside the local police 
station were unsure the new travel freedom would last like the 
millions of other citizens of the soviet bloc they have heard 
enough promises from the communists to be skeptical 
i dont trust it yet said an elderly lady who like others 
in bernau was loath to identify herself to a western reporter 
but even the caution could not contain peoples joy at what one 
22yearold factory worker uwe termed simply liberation 
its like being the child who stands in front of the christmas 
tree waiting for the lights to go on then sees them light up and 
spots the drum he always wanted under the tree said a worker in 
his 40s today we got our drum 
as the hundreds waited for visas the tiny trabant cars that are 
the hallmark of east german roads rolled past several packed with 
happy people waving west berlin newspapers or their new travel 
documents 
everybody in east germany seemed to be on some kind of high 
friday 
border guards raised for decades to defend the barbed wire 
trenches and concrete slabs that make up the berlin wall watched 
almost absentmindedly as thousands poured past them into the west 
where just weeks ago public conversation was conducted in the 
whispers common in states with a strong police presence laughter 
and joy rang out 
the train from bernau to east berlin was packed with young 
people in high spirits before their first trip west 
warst du schon drueben were you already over there was 
the question ringing out in the train and on bernaus station 
square 
in east berlin flower vendor hedwig bruecher a 65yearold 
widow noted that almost all her customers wore a happy smile 
friday 
normally we all look at each other so bitterly or are just 
plain bored she said but today everyones happy i couldnt 
be happier if id found 1000 marks and that with a pension of 
just 300 marks a month 
one of the happiest people in east berlin friday was her next 
customer wolfgang schmidt 
buy two bouquets urged mrs bruecher its a real 
holiday what do you mean asked schmidt you really dont 
know the incredulous flower vendor responded theyve opened 
the borders 
is that really true can that be weve just come from 
leningrad and we know nothing they did what i cant believe it 
stuttered the amazed schmidt 
some folks in bernau are still skeptical however 
everybody is so suspicious confided a middleaged woman 
outside the police station 
three workers who knocked off early from the local heating plant 
after drinking a schnaps or two in honor of the great day seemed to 
agree 
travel that doesnt do it said norbert them 49 i want 
to be able to buy something for my money here

arts endowment chairman john e frohnmayer 
says he will strike a balance between the public trust and total 
artistic freedom but doesnt want his agency to become the 
governments arts cop under a new antiobscenity law 
the endowment funds artistic excellence and theres a period 
at the end of that sentence he said friday in his first public 
speech since taking command of the national endowment of the arts a 
month ago 
the fundamental point is that art must and will speak for 
itself if we fund artistic excellence we wont have to and 
shouldnt have to apologize for it he said 
frohnmayers remarks were intended to dispel fears within the 
arts community that a political furor over federal subsidies for 
controversial art will lead to government censorship 
are we going to be an arts cop he asked the answer is 
no 
the national assembly of state arts agencies audience applauded 
politely as frohnmayer declared he would balance the public trust 
and total artistic freedom in awarding taxpaid arts grants 
frohnmayer defended his decision to withdraw a 10000 endowment 
grant to artists space a private new york city gallery for an 
aids art show on the ground that it would violate the new federal 
statute 
we ought not to be funding obscenity he said adding the 
endowment should not subsidize political polemics either 
frohnmayer said wednesday he decided to withdraw the grant to 
artists space because the nature of the show had changed from an 
artistic focus to a political focus 
at a news conference friday in manhattan susan wyatt executive 
director of artists space expressed concern the united states 
might be returning to the 1950s era in which artists were 
blacklisted for unpopular political views 
she said an exhibition of east european art at her gallery last 
june demonstrated the aesthetic poverty of official vs 
unofficial art i sincerely hope that this country is not moving in 
that direction 
frohnmayer said friday his decision to withhold the endowment 
funds from artists space was based on a serious erosion in the 
artistic vision of the exhibition since the gallerys grant 
application was approved by an nea panel in february

the international monetary fund will offer a 
loan of about 14 billion to argentinas government under new 
president carlos menem 
the new loan is to be disbursed over 16 months to one of the 
worlds biggest and most troubled debtors the funds spokesman 
said friday 
this is evidence of the solidity of the argentine governments 
program and will be a clear signal of support by the international 
community said argentine ambassador guido di tella 
the loan is expected to encourage banks to talk with argentina 
in an attempt to reduce its old debt of 60 billion not including 
about 45 billion of back interest it has failed to pay in recent 
months debts to us banks may reach 10 billion 
the spokesman who gave his information on condition his name 
not be used said details of the funds offer will be announced on 
monday 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady has urged banks which hold 
most of argentinas debt to reduce the principal and interest 
payments 
the fund is owned by 152 governments with the united states 
holding the largest voting strength their representatives met 
behind closed doors the spokesman said no objections were raised 
although the meeting lasted well beyond usual working hours 
the fund generally divides its disbursements into slices 
disbursement is stopped if its conditions are not met 
usually the fund imposes strict conditions in return for its 
loans requiring the debtor government to reduce its spending and 
domestic borrowing and often to devalue its currency such 
measures usually result in reduced government subsidies and other 
austerity measures 
some measures have already been taken in argentina inflation 
was brought down to 56 percent for the month of october from 197 
percent in july by devaluation increases in charges for public 
services and guidelines for wages and prices

joachim maitre a defector from east germany and 
dean of the college of communication at boston university didnt 
think hed live to see the day east germans climbed over the berlin 
wall 
on thursday his homeland declared the end of restrictions on 
emigration or travel to the west and thousands of east germans 
walked ran biked and drove their way across to west berlin 
young east berliners straddled the crest of the wall into the 
early hours today their dancing champagne drinking and revelry 
was watched by millions including maitre 
frankly i never thought id see this maitre said friday 
im a skeptic by nature but the system is crumbling sooner than 
i had thought it ever would 
as a youth the 54yearold maitre was a political firebrand and 
opponent of the government he he was declared a subversive after 
taking part in a june 17 1953 uprising in east berlin and fled 
to the west 
i knew i could no longer look forward to a future there 
maitre said he said his own defection was uneventful since at 
the time it was relatively easy to cross to the west 
maitre finished his schooling in west germany and embarked on a 
career in journalism a staunch anticommunist he became a foreign 
correspondent on defense and strategic issues for conservative 
publications in germany and the united states he came to this 
country in 1983 
most of my classmates stayed behind he said today i 
know that for them the last 30 years or so of their lives will be 
satisfactory in terms of liberty its an emotional response 
really 
maitre said further reforms were inevitable in east germany and 
predicted that opposition political parties which previously

a maryland company says it will begin field 
trials of a plant vaccine that could inoculate corn plants against 
an insect that costs us farmers 500 million a year 
in greenhouse tests corn borer damage was reduced by 80 percent 
in plants inoculated with the naturally occurring microorganism 
according to a statement released friday by crop genetics 
international of hanover md 
this is the first time that a plant has been able to grow its 
own geneticallyengineered pesticide in its vascular system the 
company said 
the borer is a pest on 20 million acres of the us corn crop 
the company said us farmers annually lose 200 million bushels of 
corn worth 500 million to the borer 
if it proves to be effective if it can be easily used and it 
is not too costly it will do minnesota farmers a lot of good 
said ken ostlie a university of minnesota entomologist 
minnesota lost an average of 107 million worth of corn to the 
borer from 1981 to 1983 years in which borer infestation was 
particularly bad ostlie said 
the microorganism whose scientific name is bacillus 
thuringiensis is harmless to humans and animals making it 
preferable to chemical pesticides according to the company which 
specializes in developing biological pesticides

georgetown university students have refused to 
publish an edition of their newspaper because school officials 
forbade them to run an advertisement on an abortion rights rally 
the roman catholic universitys stand on the advertisement 
prompted swift protests from prochoice organizations and national 
education groups 
the ad was not promoting any specific service said karl 
hente a senior who serves as the papers managing editor the ad 
was for a prochoice rally and was basically expressing a political 
viewpoint the newspapers foundation is freedom of expression 
the twiceweekly georgetown hoya had first asked university 
officials to review the ad but when the university was slow to 
respond the papers student board of directors voted on wednesday 
to include the ad in fridays edition

a new kind of currency is showing 
up in every corner of this berkshire hills town including the 
church collection plate 
its called deli dollars a limited local currency devised to 
try to help frank tortoriello move his eatery 
with the help of a nonprofit group called share which promotes 
the regions economy tortoriello is selling notes redeemable in 
sandwiches or other deli fare in 1990 the bagel bucks are in the 
form of 10 certificates that sell for 8 or 100 worth for 75 
i think its a wonderful new capitalist experiment said the 
rev charles vanausdall who discovered one of the notes rustling 
on the collection plate at the first congregational church 
about half of the 500 burgundyandcream deli dollars printed 
were snapped up within the first 10 days they were offered the 
notes can be redeemed next year 
the idea is for tortoriello to get money upfront to move his 
business to a better site loyal customers get a chance to show 
support and get a break on next years sandwich bills 
its really just a gift certificate but its also people 
acknowledging that they can be used more than once can circulate 
more than once said susan witt administrator of share 
dabbling in new forms of currency doesnt seem to be the main 
interest of those who buy the coupons from the unpretentious 
restaurant that serves breakfasts deli fare soups and sandwiches 
with names like cool hand cuke 
instead buyers say they want to support an institution in great 
barrington a small town dotted with new england clapboard houses 
and featuring an 1895 statue of a newsboy at one of the main 
intersections 
franks a friend and im willing to help him out said ron 
white owner of white knight records which will accept the notes 
at face value toward purchases 
share officials say its too soon to gauge the success of deli 
dollars as an alternative medium of exchange but claim it could be 
a step toward regionally backed financing that could spur local 
growth 
one of the problems that you get with us dollars is that 
they tend to leave the region rather quickly said robert swann 
the last effort at an alternative currency in new england came 
in the 1970s with the introduction of the constant in exeter nh 
that currency was designed to be inflationproof said swann who 
was involved in the project 
the constant was issued by banks in exeter and was backed by a 
mix of 30 widely used commodities the safeguard against inflation 
was that if one commodity went up it could be offset by a decrease 
in others 
although the idea never really took root from 1972 to 1974 
about 200 people converted about 100000 into constants through 
local trade 
share would like to see something similar in the berkshires 
were not advocating a departure from national currency 
said witt we would like to suggest that regions could create 
their own currency based on something of value in that area 
share is accepting deli dollars at face value for membership in 
their organization tortoriello said hell also be using them as 
partial payment to contractors who will be doing some of the 
renovations involved in the move 
for vanausdall who wrote up the project in his church 
newsletter the idea of an alternate exchange could work in a town 
where were all friends and neighbors 
i think people do see a potential here for something bigger 
and something that could affect all of us in more ways he said

jerome lemelson has spent decades inventing 
gadgets in his princeton nj home 
but it was in a chicago courtroom this week that lemelson may 
have seen his biggest success a multimillion dollar vindication 
of a decadelong patent infringement suit against toymaker mattel 
inc 
lemelson a prolific inventor with more than 400 creations to 
his credit was awarded 248 million in damages for mattels 
willful infringement on lemelsons patent a flexible track 
thats part of the companys hot wheels toy system 
i am floating on cloud nine lemelson 66 said friday my 
hope is that as a result of it the decision toy inventors will 
get a fair shake from the industry 
the 248 million could be increased substantially by us 
district judge charles kocoras who has the discretion under 
federal law to triple the award and to determine the amount of 
interest mattel must pay 
a final ruling from kocoras is due within the next couple of 
weeks lemelsons attorneys said 
in any case hawthorne califbased mattel said it would appeal 
there are differences in mattels track from the patent 
said company spokesman glenn bozarth 
hot wheels which glide on flexible tracks ramps jumps and 
loops brought in 545 million in sales between 1972 and 1986 only 
6 percent of which is based on the sale of tracks bozarth said 
the toy is mattels most popular offering after barbie dolls 
lemelson a selfdescribed tinkerer has spent his life 
putting creative ideas into action 
working out of an office in his princeton nj home lemelson 
is responsible for gadgets that run the gamut from parts for 
fighter planes to inflatable childrens equipment 
his latest creation a talking thermometer for the blind 
is due on the market later this year he said 
lemelson filed suit against mattel in 1977 in chicago selected 
for the reputation of its circuit court for finding in favor of 
inventors the lawsuit alleged the toymaker infringed on lemelsons 
1969 patent for the hot wheels track 
lemelson said he filed papers on his creation with the us 
patent and trademark office in the mid1960s some time before 
mattels 1968 introduction of hot wheels 
mattel attorneys had argued the companys hot wheels differed 
conceptually from lemelsons patent and were developed 
independently

highlevel delegations from the soviet union 
and united states will meet next week to explore ways of expanding 
trade as a prelude to the december summit between president bush 
and president mikhail gorbachev 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher will lead the us 
delegation in the talks wednesday and thursday at the commerce 
department the soviet side will be headed by konstantin f 
katushev soviet minister of foreign economic relations 
one of the items on the agenda for discussion will be the soviet 
push for waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment that imposes tariffs 
on soviet imports coming into the united states that are generally 
five to 10 times higher than tariffs imposed on other countries 
bush announced last may that he would ask congress to remove the 
soviet union from the jacksonvanik tariff restrictions if the 
soviets put gorbachevs more liberal emigration policies into law 
and followed through with successful implementation of the new 
policies 
more than 50000 jews have already been allowed to leave the 
soviet union this year and the supreme soviet is expected to pass a 
new emigration law by the end of this month 
because of these developments there is wide speculation bush 
will soon propose a waiver of jacksonvanik a move favored by many 
members of congress and by various jewish groups 
in the present climate bush will get all the support he needs 
for such a move said rep tom lantos dcalif 
david harris of the american jewish committee said if the 
president feels he has assurances from the soviets that impediments 
to free emigration will be removed and the continued high numbers 
will be allowed out we will support a waiver 
the commerce department trade talks are coming just two weeks 
before the ussoviet mediterranean summit scheduled for dec 23 
officials said the discussions could set the stage for 
announcements by bush and gorbachev although they cautioned it was 
too early to speculate on the outcome of the negotiations 
one administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said in addition to jacksonvanik the commerce 
department session would cover such issues as us export controls 
on shipments of hightechnology items and the soviet unions bid 
for admission to the general agreement on tariffs and trade the 
worldwide body governing trade 
the commerce talks are formally known as the usussr joint 
commercial commission a group set up in 1972 to promote trade 
between the two nations the discussions have been held annually 
since then except for a period in the early 1980s when they were 
suspended after the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
so far this year trade between the united states and the soviet 
union totals 36 billion us export sales to the soviet union 
primarily agricultural products amounted to 31 billion while 
soviet sales to america totaled 502 million giving the united 
states a trade surplus with the soviet union of 26 billion

than 100000 jubilant east germans climbed over and rushed through 
borders for the first time since 1961 they chatted amiably with 
stonyfaced guards who no longer have orders to open fire 
thousands crossed back and forth during the day west german 
television showed east german guards helping east berliners climb 
over the wall to avoid congested check points some border guards 
were handed roses by beaming girls

hoping to speak with krenz who has stunned the world with rapid 
reforms and a pledge of free elections intended to appease 
prodemocracy protesters and end emigration to the west

east germans used a hydraulic crane to dismantle the round top 
of the concrete wall east german workers could be heard knocking 
on the wall 
peter zeisler a west german police official at the scene said 
it will be a pretty hole that will make it possible for people 
and cars to come through 
when the barrier was finally broken through early saturday east 
german border guards and west german police shook hands then other 
east german guards immediately placed a flimsy redandwhite metal 
barrier in front of the opening 
on the western side of the wall dozens of firemen dismantled 
observation platforms from which west berliners used to gaze 
across about 400 people watched occasionally setting off 
fireworks 
we are speechless said helmut keuchel 48 this is a 
fabulous and overwhelming experience

great monument that like the wall was a symbol of berlins 
division many danced on the wall drank champagne waved

control point and many crossed without special documents

a look around and then go back over said a young man who visited 
herleshausen with four compatriots we dont know what our boss

descendants of german immigrants cheered the 
new breach in the berlin wall raising their glasses in restaurants 
and clubs that show the heavy german influence on this midwestern 
city 
east germany announced friday it was permanently lifting travel 
restrictions on its citizens and workers today began knocking new 
holes in the berlin wall 
while irene blau director of the deutschstadt heritage 
foundation said the sight of berliners dancing on the wall 
brought tears to my eyes others celebrated heartily 
jerry grosenick the grandson of a german immigrant and owner of 
jerrys old town inn in suburban germantown served up a beverage 
he called the commie pig to go with the restaurants 
germanstyle pork ribs 
as many as half of the 14 million residents of the milwaukee 
area have german roots said dr ernst edlhauser executive 
director of the goethe institute in milwaukee 
for the last half century the german community in milwaukee has 
held an annual lakefront ethnic festival and has many social groups 
in the community many of the leading business and political 
figures are of german descent 
many germans moved to the milwaukee area around 1870 edlhauser 
said and were involved initially in brewing and farming land 
conditions in the midwest were similar to those in germany 
they were hardworking energetic people that were very 
inventive he said 
victor mader owner of maders german restaurant in milwaukee 
said his grandfather charles mader brought a strong work ethic 
with him when he came to milwaukee in the 1890s today the family 
restaurant has become a milwaukee landmark and popular dining spot 
for business people 
my father always thought about the restaurant when he wasnt 
here mader said im the same way now i consider myself 
aggressive and i think my father instilled that in me 
what causes it personality the german ethic i dont know 
he said 
edlhauser said better living conditions and greater freedoms are 
the two reasons most east germans will leave their country but he 
doesnt expect all residents to get up and move 
those in their forties or upwards with families will probably 
think twice about leaving he said the younger people are a 
different story people are just satifisfied that they can move 
from one country to another 
many people going to west germany are just trying to see if 
its real blau said 
i dont think the wall will ever come down completely 
edlhauser said for the future there will still be two germanys 
maybe in the long run well see more political freedom and possibly 
free elections

president bush accused by democrats of favoring 
tax relief for the rich is trying to link his drive for a capital 
gains tax cut to a new package of housing aid for the homeless 
bush unveiled a 42 billion package of housing initiatives in a 
speech friday before the national association of realtors 
im calling on congress to renew the lowincome housing tax 
credit but make it part of a package that also includes the cut in 
the capital gains tax the president said in introducing his new 
initiative hope or home ownership and opportunity for people 
everywhere 
bush gave no inkling of how he planned to pay for his housing 
initiative which would cost 42 billion in direct expenditures 
over three years plus several billions in foregone federal 
taxes according to secretary of housing and urban development jack 
kemp 
but kemp claimed that if congress would reduce the capital gains 
levy to 15 percent from the 28 percent to 33 percent range 
treasury revenues would shoot up 20 billion next year 
democrats dispute that saying it would cost taxpayers in the 
long run 
kemp said the several billions extra in the housing package 
would go to pay for extending the lowincome housing credit as well 
as other tax breaks for housing firsttime homebuyers for 
example would be allowed to withdraw 10000 from individual 
retirement accounts without penalty 
bush proposed 215 billion in grants to help lowincome 
families buy units in public housing buildings or vacant or 
foreclosed properties state and local governments or nonprofit 
groups would have to kick in 1 for every 2 in federal money to 
qualify for the grants 
bush said his aim is to recapture the american dream for home 
ownership for those who have been left behind 
he thanked the realtors for their backing in the capital gains 
battle and said that fight is not over the house passed a 
capital gains cut but democratic leaders have blocked a vote in 
the senate 
bushs housing package includes 1075 billion for tenants to 
convert and rehabilitate federally subsidized housing into 
residentowned cooperatives tenant groups would have the first 
right to buy buildings whose owners leave the lowincome housing 
programs about 334000 units would be affected by that provision 
in the next 15 years 
it also would provide 210 million for insurance and rental 
rehabilitation grants in 50 housing opportunity zones in urban 
and rural pockets of poverty 
it would target 44 million for a demonstration project to set 
up servicesupported housing for the frail elderly that would 
give them both housing vouchers and assistance to pay for drug and 
alcohol treatment mental health care and other services it also 
would link some housing grants to a requirement that local 
authorities provide those services 
kemp called bushs package the most dramatic effort to 
combat poverty homelessness and despair that this nation has seen 
from any recent president certainly any republican president

bulgarias foreign minister took over 
from longtime communist leader todor zhivkov with promises of 
political reform but he also indicated the party has no intention 
of sharing power 
zhivkov who led bulgaria through the cold war and made it an 
impenetrable part of the iron curtain resigned friday in the 
latest political upheaval in the soviet bloc 
zhivkov 78 was the soviet blocs longestserving party leader 
when he stepped down at a meeting of the policysetting central 
committee he served as communist party head for 35 years during 
which he molded bulgaria into one of the kremlins most loyal 
allies 
petar mladenov the new leader is considered a relative 
moderate whose stands have sometimes nettled hardliners in his 
inaugural speech he pledged a free flow of information and 
guaranteed human rights but gave few details 
he also indicated he would tolerate some opposition 
we should not worry nor should we be scared by the fact that 
at seeking right solutions there can and surely will be 
pluralism in the opinions he said his remarks were reported by 
bta the official bulgarian news agency 
however mladenov said all decisions and political developments 
may occur only within the framework of socialism and on the road 
of socialism making it clear he does not intend for the 
bulgarian communists to share power 
mladenov 53 was foreign minister for the past 18 years 
zhivkovs resignation followed by weeks the removal of 
77yearold erich honecker in east germany where mass emigration 
and protest have propelled breathtaking change it leaves nicolae 
ceausescu of romania as the last old guard communist still reigning 
in eastern europe 
in addition to leaving as party chief zhivkov stepped down from 
the 10member ruling politburo and asked to be released as 
president a ceremonial post 
a new president was to be elected by the national assembly 
bulgarias parliament next week that body also is likely to 
undergo some personnel changes 
zhivkov gained ultimate power as communist party chief in 1954 
with the help of bulgarian supporters of soviet dictator josef 
stalin who died the year before dogmatic and conservative 
zhivkov displayed a gift for smoothing over party dissent he 
consolidated power partly by purging opponents 
mladenov who suffered a heart attack a few years ago was 
earlier rumored to be seeking the post of chairman of the national 
assembly a less strenuous job than that of foreign minister 
but a source familiar with the government speaking on condition 
of anonymity said he appears to have recovered sufficiently to 
take the most important office in the country 
mladenov is likely select a new set of top officials and have 
them confirmed at another central committee session within the next 
three weeks the same source said 
he indicated he plans to make personnel changes in bulgaria but 
he acknowledged the struggle will be very severe 
bulgaria under zhivkov paid lipservice to change but the 
leadership has resisted the broad political reforms already seen in 
poland and hungary and possibly coming to east germany 
mladenov said friday the party must seek the support of the 
people if it hoped to carry out necessary economic changes 
declaring no initiative can survive if it is not fully backed up 
by society 
he said that in efforts to provide full glasnost we must 
not only give more freedom of speech to the press but full 
freedom of all information 
we have to turn bulgaria into a contemporary democratic and 
lawabiding country he said 
he also made a promise of legislation on human rights but gave 
few details it was not clear what impact his plans would have on 
the dozen or so small independent groups seeking official 
recognition in bulgaria

thousands of east berliners went on a shopping 
spree on the other side of the berlin wall with about 50 in 
welcome money compliments of west germany 
for many of the east berliners who streamed across the border 
friday it was their first sight of the west day trippers making 
history 
i was 4 when the berlin wall went up in 1961 said east 
berliner ellen schmidt who had tears in her eyes as she waited on 
a bank line in west berlin 
ive never skipped work before but i couldnt help it today 
i just had to come its a chance its amazing just amazing 
stefan needack a 27yearold carpenter from east berlin stood 
in the wertheim department store on west berlins elegant 
kurfuerstendamm shopping street he was trying to decide whether to 
buy perfume for his girlfriend splurge on new clothes or just look 
ive waited for this day all my life coming here its like 
learning to walk again he said 
outside the store hundreds of other east germans milled around 
with west berliners staring up at a building with the sign hello 
neighbors from east berlin welcome to berlin 
banks which normally close at 1 pm on fridays stayed open 
through the early evening dispensing a gift of 100 west german 
marks about 50 in welcome money to each arrival from 
toddlers in strollers to grandparents 
the west german government for years has been giving the money 
to all east germans to help them cover the cost of their trips 
since east german marks are not convertible 
each of the east berliners who crossed got the money simply by 
presenting their identity card or filling out a form their 
documents were stamped to show theyd received the onetime payment 
bank clerks moved up and down the lines handing out forms 
telling surprised young mothers that babies were eligible too 
shaking hands and moving on to the next ones 
it would take me two months to earn enough to buy this amount 
of west german money at home said annakatherine schwartz 26 
who arrived on a commuter train with her husband and baby 
for the couple who run a small business selling plants in east 
berlin it was their first sight of the west 
like most others interviewed while waiting at banks shopping at 
stores or just strolling theyd come just for the day 
mrs schwartz said the family had thought of trying to leave 
east germany permanently but she said that now just knowing they 
can come easily makes the prospect less enticing 
east germany is still home we have a lot of social security 
there its different here she said the best would be one 
germany 
as part of the welcome to the east berliners some stores posted 
notices announcing customers could pay in east german marks a 
battered currency not normally exchangeable in the west 
however the official rate was 10 east german marks for one west 
german mark 
needack the carpenter from east berlin earns 750 east german 
marks a month he changed a third of a months paycheck and it paid 
only for a scarf

twentyfive years ago a concerned mother made 
tape recordings of textbooks to help her partly blind daughter 
through college 
her labor of love grew into educational tape recording for the 
blind inc one of the hundreds of us companies that enable the 
blind to hear the books they cannot see 
through the volunteer efforts of that concerned mother etr 
founder vivette ravel rifkin and a group of retirees the service 
has a library of thousands of taped books from shakespeare to 
software texts bringing the printed word to disabled students 
across the country and overseas 
i give those people at educational tape recording my absolute 
highest recommendation possible said john bierdz 29 a visually 
impaired high school teacher in elgin who says he owes his 
undergraduate and masters degrees to them 
theres no way i could have done any of this without their 
help he said 
mrs rifkin started the business in 1964 with 500 and 50 reels 
of tape finding volunteer readers through ads at local churches 
and libraries 
since then the service has recorded about 20000 textbooks for 
7000 students she said in a recent interview from etrs southwest 
side headquarters 
for a 20 yearly fee students who register with the service can 
have all the textbooks they want recorded 
etrs 125 readers mostly retired professionals with expertise 
in fields related to the books they record are all volunteers 
i love it said edna wessendorf a retired government budget 
officer whos been an etr reader for 11 years im handicapped 
im on crutches i feel like im doing something worthwhile for 
somebody 
the 35 office workers who help maintain etrs 10000tape 
library and run its gift shop also are volunteers the stores 
entire inventory is donated and its proceeds are the operations 
major source of revenue 
mrs rifkin etrs unsalaried chief has recorded books for the 
service every day since she started it 
etr is one of about 500 small operations offering taped books in 
the united states said john kelly director of library services 
for recording for the blind

thousands of volunteers is one of the three giants in the field 
along with the national library service for the blind and 
physically handicapped and the american printing house for the 
blind kelly said

nearly all the textbooks her partly blind daughter gerlyn used at 
the university of missouri while earning a degree in special 
education for the orthopedically handicapped 
gerlyn and mrs rifkins son jeremy rifkin an environmental

nicaraguan rebels and the leftist 
sandinista government ended a twoday round of talks after moving 
closer to restoring a truce and bringing the insurgents home from 
honduras officials said 
in nicaragua however the two sides accused each other friday 
of launching more attacks in the 8yearold war that has cost an 
estimated 12000 lives 
a rebel radio broadcast said nicaraguan troops continue 
bombarding the civilian population in jinotega province in 
northern nicaragua but mentioned no casualties it said the 
helicopter attacks occurred nov 2 
the defense ministry said forces of the usbacked contra 
rebels this week attacked trucks carrying soldiers killing two 
soldiers and injuring seven most of the rebels are based in 
neighboring honduras but some are in nicaragua 
last week nicaraguan president daniel ortega canceled a 
19month ceasefire saying raids by the contras were endangering a 
campaign for national elections feb 25 the contras deny they 
started the fighting 
this weeks talks at un headquarters recessed late friday 
they will resume monday in washington at the headquarters of the 
organization of american states said un spokesman juan carlos 
brandt 
the oas and the united nations are sponsoring the talks the 
first between the two sides since june 1988 
brandt said progress was being made on the sandinista demand 
that the contras disband and on rebel proposals for an amnesty and 
truce 
i think we were able to find some coincidence of views said 
the chief nicaraguan negotiator deputy foreign minister victor 
hugo tinoco 
next week in washington we are going to continue those 
discussions and we hope we will able to get a sound agreement that 
will incorporate the demobilization and the ceasefire he told 
reporters 
as the talks the two sides were discussing the toughest issue 
whether the contras will commit to a timetable for disbanding as 
part of a package deal including a ceasefire and amnesty 
we are negotiating now our return to nicaragua and we are 
ready to go back once there is a meeting of minds between the 
sandinistas and our side said enrique bermudez the contra 
military commander and chief negotiator 
a regional peace agreement signed by central american presidents 
in august at tela honduras requires that the contras disband by 
dec 5 and that nicaragua hold free elections 
the contras did not sign that pact but bermudez has not 
rejected the dec 5 deadline or the concept of demobilization 
according to a source close to the talks 
we are negotiating in that sense it is positive it is 
negative in the sense that we could not achieve a ceasefire there 
is a war in nicaragua bermudez said in public comments 
diplomats said privately that the rebel delegation wanted to 
confer over the weekend with a new contra leadership commission 
announced this week 
a new element of uncertainty is whether contra field commanders 
would obey the new leaders and abide by a peace agreement 
this week a new rebel civilianmilitary commission was 
announced retaining only one of the former contra directors 
aristedes sanchez some former directors said they had been ousted 
in what they called a coup 
the leader of the new contra commission israel galeano said in 
a letter to vice president dan quayle that it would be foolish to 
voluntarily hand over our weapons before free elections are held

the manslaughter trial of a miami police officer in 
the shooting of a black motorcyclist ground to a halt over a 
defense challenge to the seating of a black juror 
the swearingin of a sixmember jury and four alternates for the 
racially charged trial was delayed friday by dade circuit judge 
joseph farina after the defense appealed his decision to seat black 
postal worker ezra simmons 
the 3rd district court of appeals was scheduled to rule monday 
on the emergency appeal by attorney roy black who represents 
suspended officer william lozano 
black sought to reject simmons using one of six opportunities 
attorneys on each side are allowed to reject a juror without giving 
a reason 
farina ruled that blacks move to drop simmons was based soley 
on simmons race 
black who already used five of his automatic disqualifications 
said he wanted to reject simmons because of his union activity 
advising accused drug users 
colombianborn lozano fired a single shot at clement lloyd 23 
during a police chase in miamis predominantly black overtown 
section jan 16 lloyds passenger allan blanchard 24 later died 
from injuries sustained when the motorcycle crashed three days of 
race riots ensued 
lozano 30 contends he fired in selfdefense because he was in 
danger of being run down by the motorcycle 
black has repeatedly objected to there being only one hispanic 
on the jury claiming that ratio does not give fair representation 
of miamis large spanishspeaking community 
its a skewed jury and my client would be denied a panel that 
doesnt reflect the community the attorney said 
black sought an immediate suspension of jury selection once 
farina agreed to seat simmons while the judge went ahead with the 
selection process 
but farina said he wouldnt swear in the jury until there is a 
ruling on the appeal which seeks to overrule farinas decision and 
seat another juror 
the five other potential jurors include two white women a white 
man a black woman and a hispanic woman the alternates include two 
white women a hispanic woman and a hispanic man

mindful that millions of chinese protested for 
democratic reform only five months ago the chinese media have been 
careful in reporting the dramatic political changes in east germany 
the media have reported some of the developments in east germany 
without suggesting the reasons behind them they have not reported 
on the mass exodus of east germans to the west nor on crowds 
chipping away at the berlin wall with hand tools 
the peoples daily the official newspaper of the communist 
party of china today gave a dry account of how east germany had 
opened its borders to the west 
the paper noted that us secretary of state james baker hailed 
the east german move as a very positive change but it also 
quoted west germanys interior minister as urging people to think 
hard about coming over because for a long time their living 
conditions will be worse than what they have now 
while western leaders assert that leadership upheavals in east 
germany hungary poland and bulgaria indicate the failure of 
communism the chinese reports depict communism as still commanding 
the faith of the people 
krenz reelected after politburo resigns said a headline 
thursday in the official china daily the article pointed out that 
new east german leader egon krenz and seven politburo members were 
retained in the new lineup 
newspapers have not mentioned the internal political pressures 
that led to the resignation of former east german leader erich 
honecker 
the only mention of east germany in mondays peoples daily was 
a report of three ruffians who were sentenced to two to four 
years in prison for destroying public facilities and illegally 
disturbing social order during a march on the evening of oct 3 
the paper did not mention that hundreds of thousands of east 
germans had been holding marches for weeks demanding democratic 
reforms and permission to leave the country freely 
prodemocracy demonstrations rocked about 80 chinese cities last 
spring culminating in the crackdown on protesters in beijings 
tiananmen square june 3 
hundreds and possibly thousands were killed during the crackdown 
that day and the next thousands more have been arrested since 
squelching the remnants of overt political dissent

the boeing co is pressuring its engineers and 
some other professional employees to perform work normally done by 
striking machinists the engineers union said 
leaders of the seattle professional engineering employees 
association boeings secondlargest union with 28000 members 
have been told that unless their members take up some of the 
strikers tasks they may face layoffs according to the groups 
weekly newsletter 
it is the companys claim that cashflow problems dictate 
either a reduction in force among employees in other pay codes or 
performance by some of these on essential work normally done by 
strikers said the newsletter article which was published 
friday 
russ young of boeing denied that such a message had been 
delivered 
we have not told speea that we have any layoffs planned 
young said i dont know of anything that would imply that 
either 
dan mahoney general counsel to the engineers said it appeared 
boeing management was backing out of a previous agreement under 
which speea members werent required to do machinists work the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers has 
been on strike since oct 4 
in the past members were instructed to notify the engineers 
union when asked to do such work the union would then demand the 
company rescind the orders but the newsletter said the union was 
withdrawing that advice and would leave it up to members whether to 
do machinists work 
we urge all speea members to contribute money and food to 
assist the iam strikers whose needs are accelerating every day 
those members who choose to do iam work might also decide to give 
additional aid to the strikers the article said 
i call that a wimp letter said jack daniels of machinists 
district lodge 751 
daniels said members of the smaller union lack the skills to do 
work done by the strikers and if they try all theyre going to 
do is shoot themselves in the foot 
meanwhile t craig martin of boeing commercial airplanes 
confirmed that many suppliers had been told to halt or slow down 
deliveries to boeing sparking some concern of layoffs 
were concerned but were trying not to speculate said 
brian alleman of certified holding co in everett a supplier 
obviously its unknown right now how long this might last 
in washington state alone 1000 suppliers sell boeing roughly 
500 million worth of supplies annually company officials said 
boeing is by far the most important employer in the seattle area 
the machinists represent about 57800 boeing workers including 
43300 in the local district lodge 12000 in wichita kan 1700 
in portland ore and a few hundred others in california hawaii 
utah montana wyoming and other states 
negotiations have foundered on boeings refusal to offer more 
than a threeyear 10 percent wage increase and on the unions 
insistence on a greater share of the companys record profits the 
last talks ended nov 11 and none are scheduled

japan have agreed to set up a council that will act as a forum for 
dialogue on bilateral and international issues

immigration experts say it will be difficult for 
the government to find a country that will accept anticastro 
militant orlando bosch 
relatives said this week that bosch 63 is tired of jail and 
had decided to give up his fight against government efforts to 
deport him 
the justice department has promised not to send bosch to cuba 
where a death sentence awaits him 
bosch has 50 days to appeal a miami federal judges ruling 
wednesday that upheld the governments decision to deport him but 
if he notifies the government in writing that he wont appeal he 
could be deported as soon as the state department can find a 
country to accept him 
bosch has been held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center since feb 16 1988 when he flew to miami from venezuela 
he doesnt want to prolong the anguish after two years of 
this said boschs wife adriana 
bosch had spent 11 years in venezuelan prisons on charges he 
planned the bombing of a cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 
people bosch was never convicted in that case but us 
prosecutors say his anticastro activities make him a threat to 
national security

a state legislator has proposed a fine 
of 1 against anyone convicted of assaulting a flagburner in what 
a civil rights activist called an invitation to violence 
state rep shelby rhinehart the democrat who filed the bill 
said it was intended to limit punishment for those who react 
violently to flag burning 
itll protect a lot of old veterans if they attack someone 
burning a flag they wont be punished severely said rhinehart 
the bill condones violence said hedy weinberg executive 
director of the tennessee chapter of the american civil liberties 
union 
i wouldnt even question the constitutionality at this 
point she said i think whats more disturbing is the 
rationale and logic behind it what hes doing in fact is giving in 
some sense permission to veterans to become violent 
legal questions aside she wondered if there was any need for 
the bill 
ive been in tennessee five years and ive never heard of any 
flagburning incidents ms weinberg said 
the bill is one of several to be considered by the state 
legislature next year that deal with flagburning the supreme 
court ruled several months ago that such action is a protected form 
of expression prompting congress to pass a bill that prohibits 
desecration of the flag

about 3000 riot police backed by 
armored vans fired tear gas and stormed a college campus today to 
break up a student protest calling for the overthrow of president 
roh taewoo 
several dozen students and police were injured mostly by flying 
rocks police said they had no precise figures on injuries or any 
figures on arrests 
the police poured into korea university in eastern seoul as six 
armored vans with tear gas launchers fired volleys of choking gas 
students counterattacked with firebombs and rocks and the two 
sides fought for more than five hours in clashes around the huge 
campus 
police moved into the campus to stop about 1000 students and 
dissidents from holding a rally to call for the overthrow of the 
roh government 
hundreds of riot police had surrounded the campus during the 
night police stopped and questioned students trying to enter and 
some were taken away for questioning 
the attack on the campus was unusual since police normally do 
not attempt to halt protests inside school grounds but police 
commanders have been ordered to take tough measures to crack down 
on antigovernment radicals 
also today about 1000 riot police were stationed around 
dongkuk university in central seoul to prevent students from 
assembling there for a rally 
the government also banned a rally planned for sunday by 
militant labor unions calling for better pay and working conditions 
for industrial workers national police headquarters said the rally 
posed a threat to social order 
labor leaders said they would try to hold the rally anyway 
the strength of the radical student movement and allied 
dissident groups has declined in recent months because of their 
growing extremism and violent tactics 
the radicals are not considered to be a serious threat to the 
government however the roh administration insists they threaten 
national security

in a fragile coral reef off the florida keys the scene of two 
other ship groundings in less than a month 
efforts failed early today to dislodge the freighter elpis from 
the reef about five miles east of key largo 
coast guard spokesman jeff karonis said a tugboat will be 
brought in to help free the freighter carrying a cargo of sugar 
and 356 tons of fuel oil 
there have been no reports of leaks from the ship which ran 
aground about 1130 pm friday but officials are not certain of 
the extent of the damage to the reef 
the elpis was grounded near the site in the key largo national 
marine sanctuary where the 155foot freighter alec owen maitland 
ran aground oct 25 cutting a 200foot swath in the reef 
five days later the 475foot cargo ship mavro vetranic became 
lodged on a reef off the dry tortugas in the far western keys a 9 
million federal civil lawsuit charges the yugoslav freighter was 
unseaworthy and the crew was incompetent 
the mavro vetranic carrying 14300 tons of phosphate and 
143000 gallons of fuel destroyed about 500 feet of reef before 
being refloated nov 2 
karonis said subpeonas have been issued for crew members of the 
elpis and a board of inquiry will convene monday to investigate 
the grounding 
gov bob martinez today also amended an executive order to 
permit a criminal investigation into the elpis grounding said 
martinez spokesman brian ballard 
the order already encompassed the two other ships

workers punched through the berlin wall today and 
border guards from two nations reached through a gaping hole and 
shook hands in a spinetingling ceremony marking the opening of the 
border between east and west germany 
thousands of exultant east germans poured across the border for 
a second day to revel in their new freedom to travel after three 
decades of confinement in their once strictly controlled country 
east germanys adn news agency said west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and communist party chief egon krenz spoke by telephone 
today about economic relations between the nations and other 
matters related to the historic change percolating in communist 
east germany 
kohl said said the leaders would likely meet either at the end 
of the month or the beginning of december 
krenz daring gambit that by giving his people the freedom to 
travel he will stop an unprecedented exodus of his most talented 
young citizens appeared to be working 
austrian border officials said the steady flow of east germans 
refugees heading to west german through austria had slowed to a 
trickle only 150 east german asylum seekers crossed the border 
during a 24hour period ending this morning a sharp drop the from 
1000aday average of recent weeks 
in bonn the interior ministry said this morning that 140000 
east germans had arrived overnight in all of west germany through 
the newly opened borders but most appeared to be using their 
remarkable new travel privileges to visit rather than seek asylum 
ive never been in west berlin before said a beaming sabine 
gohlke 23 who came from east berlin with her husband and two 
toddlers i couldnt come before they wouldnt let me 
christopher kennedy 18 an exchange student from harrison 
ark said he wanted to see an event that is going to be in the 
history books as long as man is on the face of the earth 
west german cities all along the border were packed with east 
germans traffic jams were reported at major crossing points 
in the central state of hesse officials lifted traditionally 
strict shopclosing hours and let stores stay open as long as they 
wanted today to handle the flood in a nearrevolutionary move 
stores were also allowed to stay open on sunday in hesse 
officials in the north bavarian city of hof near the east german 
border barred traffic from downtown because of a massive influx of 
visitors awed by the relative opulence of the west 
in west berlin many danced sang and smashed bottles from atop 
the wall in a second night of celebration since the berlin border 
was opened for the first time since 1961 
two giddy exuberant days of celebrations by germans from both 
nations turned raucous at times around the wall surrounded by a 
swarming mass of celebrants there were several minor 
confrontations between police and demonstrators overnight and 
today but the crowds were brought quickly under control 
in one incident near the walls brandenburg gate about 100 
demonstrators tore several holes in the wall one 2feet wide and 
then engaged in a shoving match with east german border guards 
witnesses and radio reports said the encounter ended quickly and 
there were no injuries 
protesters also hurled bottles litter and dirt at the east 
german guards the witnesses said 
susan wulka of the west berlin police said that in several 
instances police had to restrain some in the crowds who were 
chipping away at the wall but she said no violence occurred 
the spirit of freedom now reigns all over europe poland 
hungary and now east germany kohl declared here friday night 
before leaving to hold an emergency cabinet meeting in bonn today 
kohl announced today he would be meeting soon with krenz to 
discuss the historic developments kohl also said he is constant 
contact with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose reforms 
triggered the firestorm of change sweeping the east bloc 
in east berlin communist leader krenz pledged before a rally of 
150000 people friday that the countrys new reform course will 
not be turned back 
the communist party central committee promised that its dramatic 
decision thursday to allow east germans to travel freely will be 
permanent it also said it will guarantee secret and publicly 
monitored elections 
however the government offered no details and made no reference 
to constitutional provisions guaranteeing communist dominance of 
the government 
on friday workers opened a bridge spanning the border and broke 
through the wall early today to create the first of 18 planned 
openings in the monolithic structure the symbol of cold war 
tensions that divided not only a nation but the world 
a constant stream of east germans began crossing through the new 
60foot opening at the bernauer strasse section of the wall 
early this morning east german guards and west german police 
shook hands through the newly created break in the wall to cheers 
from a crowd of about 100 who had waited through the night 
this is a wonderful day said a french policeman who 
watched who here would not be happy to see it 
the symbolic event came after another dizzying day of change in 
east germany on friday east germany announced that all border 
restrictions were lifted prompting more than 100000 jubilant east 
germans to cross into the west 
most came for a quick visit to get a glimpse of a world they 
had not been able to see for 28 years 
krenz replaced hardline leader erich honecker oct 18 amid an 
unprecedented wave of public discontent with tens of thousands 
fleeing to the west and hundreds of thousands demonstrating for 
reform almost daily 
east germanys decision to open its borders brought accolades 
from world leaders although some expressed caution against too 
swift a move to reform 
president bush said he would seize every chance to promote 
democracy in eastern europe secretary of state james a baker iii 
called the lifting of east german travel restrictions the most 
dramatic event in eastwest relations since world war ii 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
opening east germanys borders would help stem emigration and end 
stereotypes about the iron curtain 
by giving in to one of the key demands of recent weeks free 
travel the east german leadership took a calculated risk hoping 
to calm some of the anger directed at the communists 
authorities appeared relieved that so many citizens were 
prepared to go look at the west but then come back to a country 
that this year has lost 200000 mostly young skilled workers to 
west germany 
in west berlin thousands streamed along the elegant 
kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard some carrying candles others 
toasting each other crowds of young girls could be seen rushing 
down the street toward stores bars offered free drinks

the stream of east germans using hungary 
as a springboard to the west narrowed to a trickle after east 
germanys decision to open its borders austrian border officials 
said today 
while the daily number often exceeded 1000 before east germany 
on thursday lifted restrictions on direct travel to the west only 
about 150 crossed into austria from hungary in the 24hour period 
beginning at 8 am friday the officials said 
hungary had defied the east berlin leadership in throwing open 
its western border with austria to east germans at midnight sept 
10 after thousands of them refused to return home and demanded 
they be allowed to emigrate to west germany 
the total number of east germans emigrating via hungary since 
sept 11 had exceeded 51500 by this morning said the officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with austrian custom 
thousands of east germans also fled through poland and 
czechoslovakia by flocking to west german embassies in warsaw and 
prague 
the exodus and a corresponding series of demonstrations 
ultimately led to the downfall of the government of erich honecker 
and his replacement by egon krenz who has promised reforms 
krenz on thursday finally lifted travel restrictions in an 
effort to halt the mass flight of its citizens

a melee between thousands of protesters and police 
left 129 injured in moldavia and fueled calls for the southwest 
republics leadership to resign the official tass news agency 
reported today 
also today tass reported that the kremlin has told four other 
restive soviet republics that laws they have passed conflict with 
the national constitution a veiled reference to the republics 
moves toward greater autonomy 
in kishniev the moldavian capital a mob of 6000 demanding the 
release of protesters arrested during a previous protest tried to 
storm the headquarters of the interior ministry late friday night 
tass said 
protesters shouting antipolice slogans threw stones sticks and 
bottles at police then set up barricades and pelted the 
headquarters with torches and firebombs tass reported citing the 
moldavian news agency atem 
one witness said he saw the crowd turn over an ambulance tass 
said the mob also torched a police car 
police fought the protesters with rubber truncheons and water 
hoses then resorted to warning shots and tear gas the official 
news agency said 
thirty people were arrested but were released in accordance 
with demands from the crowd tass said and at least 83 police 
and 46 protesters were injured 
as midnight approached the protesters withdrew to a nearby 
square where they held a mass meeting and voiced demands for the 
resignation of the republics government and communist party 
leaders tass reported 
moldavia a republic of 43 million on the border with romania 
has seen repeated unrest this year led by the moldavian peoples 
front a grassroots group that is pushing for greater independence 
from moscow and preservation of the indigenous language and culture 
the protesters were demanding the release of about 20 people 
arrested tuesday as they gathered at a monument to a national hero 
near the route of a scheduled parade to mark the 72nd anniversary 
of communist power 
in the krelim announcement tass said the presidium of the 
supreme soviet legislature found in azerbaijan and the baltic 
republics of latvia lithuania and estonia cannot have force on 
the territory of the republics because they contradict the 
provisions of the national constitution 
it did not specify the laws but the parliaments all have passed 
laws declaring sovereignty meaning they have the right to 
declare national laws invalid locally 
the estonian parliament already has run afoul of the kremlin 
twice with controversial laws but the legislative conflicts never 
led to direct showdowns 
estonian lawmakers held fast to their sovereignty law late last 
year despite kremlin objections and the issue was never forced 
however last summer the estonians backed down on a voting law 
that set residency requirements and touched off strikes among 
russian workers in the republic 
tass said the presidium cited article 74 of the soviet 
constitution which states that national law prevails over a 
republics law when they are in conflict 
presidium members proposed that the four republics 
parliaments bring their laws in line with the constitution tass 
said it did not say what might happen if the republics resisted 
in other action the presidium approved a draft measure 
declaring the full exoneration of soviet ethnic groups who were 
forcibly resettled under dictator josef stalin who accused them of 
sympathizing with the enemy during world war ii moscow radio 
reported 
the report did not indicate if the action might lead to 
resettlement of the groups

had an urge to go to berlin now 
someday id like to see that area again id like to see it 
with the wall down not just holes in it he said 
bush said i think were seeing a disintegration of that form 
of totalitarianism in eastern europe i hope its a contagious 
disease and cuban president fidel castro catches it and 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega catches and perhaps 
panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega catches it 
bush was interviewed by reporters from the houston chronicle 
houston post dallas times herald and fort worth startelegram 
us officials traveling with the president said the 
administration had nothing concrete to right now to offer east 
germany as the events unfold 
were trying to sort out whats going on right now said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bushs remarks friday were more impassioned than his somewhat 
subdued reaction to east germanys action lifting travel 
restrictions a day earlier but he and other officials tempered 
their comments by saying the situation remains turbulent 
bush said west german chancellor helmut kohl telephoned him 
friday to discuss the developments in east germany kohl raced home 
from a politically sensitive trip to poland as thousands of germans 
from the east poured across the wall into the federal republic of 
germany 
kohl asked me to share with the american people his conviction 
that this remarkable change thats taking place in eastern 
europe most recently in the german democratic republic could 
never have taken place without the steadfast loyal support of the 
united states of america 
in washington baker suggested the administration would continue 
to react cautiously while making clear we are extraordinarily 
happy about the opening of east germanys borders 
it is important to demonstrate that we do not seek to take 
unilateral advantage of these circumstances baker said on the 
macneillehrer newshour on public television that is not in the 
best interests of the west 
i dont think its going to be reversed but it may be said 
baker calling such a backsliding extremely possible in the 
soviet union and not impossible elsewhere 
such change in previously closed societies offers us all much 
hope and deserves our continued encouragement bush said in a 
friday speech to a national association of realtors gathering 
bush later said he was looking forward to his dec 23 meeting 
with soviet president mikhail gorbachev to discuss a variety of 
subjects including the changing political face of warsaw pact 
nations 
bush and kohl agreed the mediterranean superpower meeting would 
be even more important in light of the opening of the wall 
and agreed to consult closely between now and the meeting said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
but bush speaking of the reforms gorbachev began cautioned 
this country must not base its foreign policy or its national 
security on the aspirations of one man inside the soviet union or 
anywhere else 
an official travelling with bush said the administration will 
consult with us allies to develop a multilateral approach that 
is responsive not provocative 
on the practical side the pentagon said it was making available 
housing for 980 people in three offbase installations 
defense secretary dick cheney conceded the events could bring 
changes to the western alliance 
lifting easttowest travel restrictions is a major event but 
its important for us to think what comes after that said cheney 
cheney said if it turned out that new noncommunist governments 
formed and presented less of a threat and that in turn might 
portend some changes on our side

president bush today expressed grave concern 
about the health of an imprisoned cuban dissident who is on a 
hunger strike and he called upon cuban president fidel castro to 
free all political prisoners 
in a statement issued by the traveling white house bush said 
i view with grave concern the news that longterm cuban 
political prisoner alfredo mustelier nuevo has been on a hunger 
strike since completing 20 years in castros prisons on oct 27 
for the past week he has been refusing liquids as well and his 
current health situation is extremely serious 
bush said two other political prisoners ernesto diaz rodriquez 
and maio chanes de armas have languished in cuban prisons for 
over 20 years after trials that lacked any semblance of due 
process 
the president said the three are no threat to the cuban 
government i call upon the cuban government to release these men 
immediately as well as to free all remaining political prisoners 
bush also mentioned castro in an interview friday with texas 
reporters focusing on east germanys opening of its borders and 
other waves of change sweeping through eastern europe 
i think were seeing a disintegration of that form of 
totalitarianism in eastern europe i hope its a contagious disease 
and castro catches it and nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
catches and perhaps panamanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega catches it bush said

the national endowment for democracy a 
private group using public money walks a fine line between 
promoting democratic ideals overseas and interfering in foreign 
politics 
one of its major tasks this year is to aid the political 
opposition coalition poised to take on nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government in elections scheduled for february 
such moves are not new for the ned which played 
behindthescenes roles in support of political movements in 
poland chile and the philippines and was recently accused of 
partisan politics in costa rica 
in nicaragua its the only way to help mrs violeta 
chamorro and the opposition to assure a reasonable shot at free and 
fair elections white house spokesman marlin fitzwater quoted 
president bush as saying while congress considered 9 million in 
assistance that was eventually approved to help the nicaraguan 
opposition 
the ned charter however says no endowment funds may be 
used to finance the campaigns of candidates for public office 
to reconcile that apparent conflict endowment officials say 
they are not helping mrs chamorro but rather nicaraguas 
democratic coalition and that mrs chamorro just happens to be 
the coalitions candidate to replace nicaraguan president daniel 
ortega 
if were not going to enter into those situations supporting 
democratic groups we would not be doing our job says neds 
president carl gershman 
rep stephen solarz dny an endowment supporter says the 
nicaraguan project approaches the line but it doesnt cross 
it he says the money will go to the campaign infrastructure 
but acknowledges that mrs chamorro will derive a considerable 
indirect benefit 
rep paul kanjorski dpa an ned critic counters that 
americans would be very annoyed if the soviet union japan or any 
other country contributed money into our electoral system 
in fact its illegal in our country kanjorski said what 
we do is make a very negative impression with yankee money 
congress established the ned in 1983 to strengthen democratic 
institutions throughout the world through private nongovernmental 
efforts the programs are funded through annual congressional 
appropriations 
the groups birth according to a 1984 study by the general 
accounting office was a reaction to public disclosure of the 
cias covert funding of overseas activities of some private 
voluntary organizations the idea was to take the shroud off 
promoting democracy and free enterprise and operate much the way 
the soviets push socialism 
yet the ned at times has become involved in countries that 
already are acknowledged democracies an endowment program in costa 
rica a democracy for 100 years was canceled recently after 
disclosure that it was aiding a group linked to the political 
opposition of costa rican president oscar arias 
the ned charter says it may not pick and choose among the 
democratic competitors solarz says the costa rican program was a 
mistake but that he is pleased that the ned acted to halt it after 
it was publicized 
most of the endowments programs are less controversial for the 
past five years it has sent money to such farflung places as 
botswana and turkey last years 168 million budget included 
40000 for publication of a vietnamese magazine focusing on the 
merits of democracy another 140000 went for leadership training 
courses in brazil 
congress last year approved 1 million to be channeled through 
the ned for voter registration and polling in chiles plebiscite in 
which the majority of chileans voted no to continuing the 
augusto pinochet dictatorship 
endowment programs for the most part are developed by four 
core grantees the aflcios free trade union institute the 
us chamber of commerces center for international private 
enterprise and matching institutes for international affairs 
linked respectively to the republican and democratic parties 
projects are approved by the neds bipartisan board of directors 
eugenia kemble head of the aflcio group recalls the earlier 
days of cia intervention and says the ned offers an alternative a 
positive american presence that contrasts to what was done 
covertly 
kanjorski however opposes the whole idea of giving us 
government money to foreign groups under the guise of a private 
organization 
we dont have enough money now to operate our government he 
said 
he especially objects to the nicaraguan project saying if it 
doesnt violate the law it should violate the intent 
ned funding for nicaraguan opposition groups rose from 455000 
in 1987 to 807000 for the year ending last sept 30 thousands of 
dollars in ned aid to the oppostion newspaper la prensa caused 
nicaraguan government supporters to dub it the cia paper 
gershman promises strict controls to insure the money is used in 
nicaragua to educate the populace about balloting and promote the 
democratic process once final program outlines are completed the 
ned and the core grantees will sign contracts with nicaraguan 
political opposition leaders 
the prosandinista media in nicaragua contend that the money 
will be used simply to buy votes two successive republican 
administrations have been attempting to depose the sandinistas 
since 1981 
j brian atwood president of the democrats arm of the ned 
says we dont care who wins but he questions the amount of 
us money earmarked for the nicaraguan vote saying it reflects a 
republican obsession with the country 
last year ned sponsored 171 programs the biggest single 
amount almost 2 million went to bolster the oncebanned polish 
solidarity trade union which emerged as a political party and 
scored a major electoral victory earlier this year against the 
communist government 
despite the polish effort which has had broad support from us 
labor unions and both republicans and democrats ms kemble and 
other ned supporters acknowledge that the endowment has made some 
mistakes 
in 1985 rep hank brown rcolo told congress the endowment 
secretly funneled money to groups actively opposed to the french 
government he called ned a loose cannon 
a year earlier ned had contributed some 20000 to a panamanian 
labor union which put the money into the campaign of a presidential 
candidate backed by gen manuel antonio noriega 
a sign of the changing tides in american foreign policy came 
last year when ned gave 55000 to help a staunchly antinoriega 
group

the navy believes its conclusions on the cause 
of the uss iowa blast that killed 47 sailors will stand up to a 
skeptical congress planning to question the services brass on the 
investigation 
we feel very confident the results of the investigation will 
pass the toughest scrutiny and when you look at all of the evidence 
and not just a little slice at a time you will come to the same 
conclusion the navy did lt cmdr craig quigley a navy 
spokesman said friday of the upcoming senate armed services 
committee hearing on the explosion 
rear adm richard milligan a 30year navy veteran who oversaw 
the technical and criminal study and capt fred p moosally the 
battleships skipper will testify thursday before the armed 
services panel 
also testifying will be robert j powers head of the criminal 
division of the naval investigative service and an official closely 
involved in the iowa inquiry 
the navy issued a report sept 7 that concluded gunners mate 
clayton hartwig most likely caused the april 19 explosion by 
inserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one 
of the ships 16inch guns 
navy officials did acknowledge that their evidence was 
circumstantial in light of the fact that all the witnesses 
including hartwig were killed in the fiery blast 
but since the reports release hartwigs family lawmakers and 
the sailors former shipmates have cast doubts about the conclusion 
rep nicholas mavroules dmass chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on investigations has said he seriously 
questioned the navys report and cited an fbi report that said 
its laboratory investigation on the incident was inconclusive 
we didnt find anything that would lead us to conclude that a 
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge the fbi said 
last month thats not to say something wasnt there our 
findings were inconclusive 
the house armed services panel is currently investigating the 
incident and the navys inquiry last week committee staff members 
interviewed kendall truitt a friend of hartwig and a sailor aboard 
the iowa who survived the blast in the lowest level of the gun 
turret 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said house armed 
services hearings on the incident before years end were unlikely 
given congress push to adjourn before the thanksgiving holiday 
staff members from the senate armed services panel also 
interviewed truitt this past week 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the committee said last month 
he was concerned with certain issues which arose during the 
navys investigation but which were not pursued since they were 
not considered to be immediately relevant to the specific task as 
hand 
while the two armed services panels are looking into the 
explosion the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress is conducting its own inquiry at the request of rep mary 
rose oakar dohio 
rep oakar has criticized the navys findings and thursday in a 
letter to navy secretary lawrence garrett iii questioned the 
services decision to make moosally eligible for another major 
command 
despite the barrage of charges and the ongoing investigations 
the navy defends its report and milligan said last week that 
nothing said in the past 3 months would make him change the 
findings 
i think the ultimate conclusion is going to be that they are 
going to support my investigation the rear admiral said 
in the latest development the navy denied on friday a published 
report that sailors aboard the uss iowa took part in looting 
shipmates possessions while they battled the explosion 
the washington times had reported that it had received a letter 
from an officer aboard the iowa who said looting occurred while the 
damage control efforts were going on 
i am sure there are sailors aboard the iowa who believe this 
occurred but there is no record that such a thing ever happened 
said quigley who called the assertions completely false

editors note the writer a retired associated press bureau 
chief was in berlin when the building of the berlin wall commenced 
28 years ago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the building of the berlin wall began 
with a few strands of barbed wire early one sunday hours later 
the citizens of east berlin became aware they were prisoners and 
they began the protests that rumbled for 28 years 
on the morning of aug 13 1961 i was awakened in my west 
berlin home and told to go to the border the warsaw pact announced 
the communist regime of east germany had been authorized to take 
measures to stop the flood of its citizens to the west i was to 
find out what these measures were 
i made for the brandenburg gate the symbol of the city and the 
site of a main crossing point between east and west and saw 
hundreds of men setting up a barbedwire fence 
armed soldiers stood guard machine guns were posted in case the 
people made a massive attempt to reach the west 
as my car had british army license plates i was able to pass 
freely through the brandenburg gate into the eastern sector 
from there i saw that the barbed wire extended as far as i 
could see in both directions 
squads of peoples militia armed factory workers stood 
by on side streets in case of popular opposition 
a squadron of soviet tanks was parked in the frederichstrasse 
train station 
hours later radio and television announced that east berliners 
had been sealed off from the devious monopoly capitalists in 
the west who had been urging them to go west for a better life 
i decided to swing through the city and return to the west 
through the crossing point at potsdamer platz 
before world war ii this was the times square of berlin a 
junction of five streets jammed with restaurants theaters 
nightclubs and cabarets now only the ghostly ruins of bombed 
building remained 
as i drove toward potsdamer platz i noticed a platoon of east 
german soldiers commanded by a young officer i stopped the car 
and pretending ignorance said good morning lieutenant what is 
going on 
as expected he was well briefed and started a long explanation 
of why it was necessary to cut off the west to prevent economic 
sabotage by the capitalists 
midway through his speech he politely asked me to move my car 
two or three yards forward 
i had a good view through the rearview mirror of soldiers 
hauling a roll of barbed wire across the street my car was the 
last to pass over the potsdamer platz 
in time the wall there became one of the most solid sections 
it was there that western authorities built a viewing platform used 
by visiting dignitaries including americans presidents to peer 
into communistruled territory 
that afternoon and night crowds gathered in west berlin to 
watch the barbed wire being erected some cried knowing they were 
now cut off from friends relatives and loved ones in the east 
over the years the wall grew into a potent symbol of communist 
oppression a huge structure of concrete and steel with 
minefields watch towers and guard dogs 
at least 200 people were killed trying to escape across it and 
families wept in frustration because they could not visit one 
another 
this weekend there were tears of joy as the wall started coming 
down

dozens of angry ravens swooped down and 
attacked an apartment building on saturday smashing into windows 
terrifying residents and injuring at least one man police said 
israels nature reserve authority officials shot two of the 
sharpbeaked black birds before chasing the flock away from the 
building in kiryat hayim near the northern port city of haifa 
it was exactly like hitchcocks movie the birds they flew 
over the house and in and out of the apartments said police 
chief superintendent roni raz there were some 50 to 70 birds 
the ravens attacked and scratched at least one man during their 
threehour assault he said 
raz said terrified residents called police to report the attack 
police arrived at the scene confirmed the report and summoned 
officials from the nature reserve authority 
they arrived in two jeeps sounded sirens and produced a lot 
of other noise but the birds would not leave then they shot two 
of the ravens raz said 
the birds retreated but came back and were finally chased away 
by warning shots in the air 
officials from the nature reserve authority said the attack may 
have resulted from an attempt to capture a young bird they said 
the ravens can watch and stage vigilante raids on their human 
enemies for months 
officials warned that the raven assault may be repeated 
especially because two of the birds were killed

change flashed across eastern europe in 
1989 from the seat of communist power in the kremlin across 
poland through hungary and to berlin where germans from east and 
west danced on top of the grim berlin wall 
the seismic shift has jolted the order created by stalin and his 
red army after world war ii and opened up the prospect of a new 
future for europe 
the year saw elections in mikhail s gorbachevs soviet union 
and free open debate in a soviet parliament things have changed 
so basically that andrei d sakharov a dissident and nobel peace 
prize winner who had been exiled to gorky in 1980 gained a seat in 
the parliament 
the first noncommunist government in the bloc was formed in 
poland hungary moved toward democracy abandoned its communist 
party and removed the red stars from its buildings 
east germans rose up deserted their discredited leaders and 
headed west by the thousands others marched through the streets 
shouting we are the people in a few days the old leaders 
were gone elections were promised and the cold concrete berlin 
wall was opened 
berliners from east and west mingled freely and drank together 
for the first time since 1961 turning the forbidding zone around 
the wall into a huge block party german hopes of a reunited nation 
in a few years were rekindled 
on friday in sofia bulgaria todor zhivkov resigned after 35 
years as communist party leader leaving nicolae ceausescu of 
romania as the last of the oldline leaders still in power in 
eastern europe janos kadar resigned in 1988 and erich honecker 
who had run the east german communist party for 18 years was 
ousted in october 
romania and czechoslovakia stubbornly resisted change but after 
the sweeping changes in east germany a country that seemed firmly 
imbedded in the hardline mold it seemed clear that pressure for 
change would mount in bucharest and prague 
it was gorbachev who provided the thrust for change 
in 1985 he took over a soviet union mired in economic problems 
tired of two decades of stagnation and thirsty for a freer life as 
he grappled with his domestic problems admiring shouts of gorby 
gorby rang out from czechs hungarians and east germans when he 
traveled to those countries his call for perestroika or 
restructuring and glasnost more openess resonated through the 
bloc and emboldened those pressing for change 
at home gorbachevs changes touched off a resurgence of 
nationalism from the baltic republics in the north to azerbaijan 
armenia and georgia in the south soviet workers were emboldened to 
strike to back up demands for better living conditions 
in the east bloc hungary had been quietly working to 
liberalize it moved swiftly after gorbachev made clear that each 
country could choose its own way in one more symbolic toppling of 
communist power hungary removed a statue of lenin near budapests 
heroes square 
parliament last month rewrote the constitution to eliminate all 
references to the leading role of the communist party in hungary 
and to build a legal groundwork for the first free multiparty 
elections since the communists consolidated power in 1948 
hungary also moved to rehabilitate those involved in the 1956 
uprising that was crushed by soviet tanks 
a new westerneuropean oriented socialist party replaced the 
communist party and has promised to relinquish power if it loses 
the elections 
in poland convulsed since 1980 by strikes growth of the 
solidarity trade union movement and imposition of martial law 
eastern europes first noncommunist government was established it 
is led by premier tadeusz mazowiecki an activist of the once 
banned solidarity movement 
as in the soviet union the first free elections resulted in 
widespread repudiation of communist party candidates vividly 
demonstrating that people were tired of communist failures the 
basic changes left a noncommunist government in poland to struggle 
with an economy ruined by years of mismanagement 
the soviet union in april began making troop cuts in hungary 
poland czechoslovakia and east germany as part of gorbachevs now 
policy of reducing arms in central europe 
the soviet leader at a landmark summit meeting of the 
sevenmember warsaw pact in july agreed with other leaders that 
each country has the right to make its own political lines 
strategy and tactics without any outside interference 
if that position is maintained it will mark the end of the 
socalled brezhnev doctrine invoked by the kremlin to justify 
soviet military intervention in czechoslovakia in 1968 
even in countries most resistant to change czechoslovakia 
romania and bulgaria leaders have had to face increasing 
opposition by citizens calling for reform 
with zhivkovs departure in bulgaria the new leader petar 
mladenov immediately issued a call for political reform 
popular discontent in romania and czechoslovakia has been kept 
in check by police but people are beginning to believe their 
rulers can no longer call on soviet tanks to back a crackdown

a bbc anchorman sat in an east berlin studio 
flanked by an east german dissident and a west german newspaper 
editor on the table lay a brick from the berlin wall 
it was one of the hundreds of breathtaking scenes that have 
drifted across the iron curtain onto the tv screens of western 
europe in the past 48 hours as a wind of change becomes a 
revolutionary storm 
most western europeans have grown up with a sense that their 
world halted at the berlin wall the division of their continent 
had come to seem as unchangeable as the atlantic ocean 
but few could have failed to share the emotion felt by jurgen 
sudhoff a west german foreign ministry official who told the bbc 
he had seen the wall go up in 1961 and watching it being 
breached i couldnt hold my tears 
live tv broadcasts and huge frontpage pictures brought the 
drama to western europe the paris daily liberation filled its 
front page with a photo of east germans climbing over the wall 
what a story exclaimed the headline 
some saw it as the end of hitlers europe the divided 
continent that emerged from the ashes of the third reich others 
saw symbolism in the timing the weekend that commemorates the end 
of the centurys other conflagration world war i 
the changes are moving too fast for the analysts to keep pace 
nobody knows where they are heading for the moment the 
inclination is to put aside the guessing games and simply let fly 
the emotions 
and what a heartstopping autumn it has been a noncommunist 
prime minister in poland hungarys abandonment of communism as the 
government creed the crumbling of the berlin wall just months 
after an east german leader vowed it would stand for 100 years 
on friday almost ignored in the hubbub bulgarian communist 
party chief todor zhivkov the longestserving eastern european 
leader resigned after 35 years in power 
only last year as the 12 nations of the european economic 
community stepped up their drive for greater unity their concept 
of europe still looked set in stone 
now soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs idea of our common 
european home is suddenly less hazy and the old notion of a 
europe from the atlantic to the urals becomes a concrete image in 
the european mind 
as an example of how far forward some commentators are now 
willing to look take paul johnson a british conservative 
commentator 
in postwar europe we have begun to build for the first time 
a community which looks beyond the nationstate he wrote in the 
weekly spectator it works and it is growing we are taking 
the first steps toward an ecumenical community which will 
ultimately spread to all four corners of our planet 
the old european order emerged from an agreement in 1945 among 
the victors of world war ii to divide europe into western and 
eastern spheres of influence pending a final peace treaty 
the western europeans embraced parliamentary democracy and an 
economic union designed to make future wars impossible the east 
europeans went communist and no peace treaty was ever signed 
instead the cold war was waged with the berlin wall as its front 
line 
now writes neal ascherson in the independent newspaper the 
brake is off and east germany which means all germany is 
rolling into the future 
but while chancellor helmut kohl may now declare that we are 
one nation the prospect of one germany causes unease to many 
for the eec it would be a colossal monkey wrench in the 
hitherto smooth work toward closer economic unity which will 
climax in three years with the dropping of all trade and passport 
barriers 
the germans already have the strongest economy in the eec 
united they would become by far the biggest most populous nation 
in the bloc it may rouse long dormant fears among the french who 
have been invaded three times by germany since 1871 and among the 
british who are historically suspicious of large powers rising to 
dominate their fellow europeans 
it would make the role of the eec far more important for many 
europeans will feel that the only safe germany is a germany 
inextricably bound up in a larger economic union 
and what of poland hungary and perhaps others once they are 
fully free democracies they will have met the main criterion for 
eec membership but will the soviet union tolerate the natural 
corollary of these states leaving comecon the communist economic 
bloc and perhaps also the warsaw pact the counterpart to nato 
moreover the changes engulfing eastern europe are dependent on 
whether gorbachev can accomplish his own countrys transition 
allow eastern europe to go its way unthreatened by soviet force 
and remain in office 
nato strategists also face long hard rethinking the cold war 
was always threatening but at least nato knew where it stood no 
longer west germany is the linchpin and a united germany takes 
nato into uncharted waters 
earlier this year nato was debating the modernization of 
shortrange nuclear weapons in europe but if the warsaw pact looks 
less threatening the task of persuading public opinion to accept 
new missiles becomes that much harder 
commented the leftleaning guardian in london if the wall can 
come down so can the alliances perhaps it will need a deal of 
tact and tactical deployment of generals without jobs but we 
should start the advance planning

the concept of a reunified germany enjoys 
support from the united states and other countries but some 
analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic 
german superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout europe 
the lifting of travel restrictions by east germany on thursday 
has breathed new life into the idea of a single german state 
drawing expressions of support from the bush administration and 
others 
but soviet affairs expert william hyland says that despite these 
assertions a reunified germany is really terrifying to most of 
the countries involved to the west germans to the united states 
soviet union poland and czechoslovakia 
no one really wants german unity except the east german 
people and they turn out to be the decisive factor says hyland 
a onetime top aide to former secretary of state henry a kissinger 
it was just 2 months ago when ceremonies were held 
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of world war ii a 
time when a unified germany initiated what was to become the 
slaughter of more than 50 million people 
while a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under 
any scenario an undivided germany could become the unchallenged 
economic and political force on the continent 
the official us policy on the reunification question was 
outlined last thursday by state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher 
reunification has been supported by nato and by the united 
states for 40 years and our strongly held view is that 
reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of germany must 
take place in peace and freedom he said 
as former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski sees it 
the reunification issue will become very very active if a 
freely elected government takes power in east germany 
that possibility has been mentioned by east german leaders as 
part of the ongoing reform process 
brzezinski asks how do we arrange for the unification of 
germany so that it doesnt become destabilizing so it isnt a 
threat to germanys neighbors france poland czechoslovakia 
these are the issues we really have to very hard think about 
we have to think of a new structure between nato and the warsaw 
pact that is our new agenda 
theodore sorenson a top aide to president john f kennedy when 
the berlin wall was built in 1961 says he hopes a reunited germany 
will be forged as part of a reunited europe 
reunification sorenson says will pose problems because we 
couldnt afford to have a reunited germany outside the western 
alliance the soviet union couldnt afford to have a reunited 
germany as part of the western alliance 
thats why i hope it will be a reunited europe within which 
the reunited germany can take place sorenson says 
bernard rogers a former commander of allied forces in europe 
does not think reunification is inevitable some form of 
federation he believes is more likely 
rogers notes that soviet president mikhail gorbachev has said 
the nations of eastern europe can do what they want so long as they 
stay in the warsaw pact 
if east germany stays in the warsaw pact nato with the best 
of its ability would try to prevent full reunification maybe a 
confederation between the two germanys but not a full 
reunification rogers says 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine points out that 
german reunification is a sensitive question for the soviets 
soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified 
economically strong and certainly militarily strong germany 
mitchell says there must be some serious apprehension in the 
soviet union today because the events of the last couple of days 
certainly has made reunification more likely 
the bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling 
of nato under any circumstances but according to hyland the 
reunification of germany could mean the demise of the alliance 
it may also mean the end of western european unity because 
both have been based on a divided germany and a divided europe 
hyland says if that comes to an end and 80 million germans are 
united in a confederation or a single state it changes the entire 
map of europe 
it changes all of the geopolitics and in effect ends the 
period weve been in since the beginning of the war

as east germany and bulgaria last week joined 
poland and hungary in the rush to restructure their creaking 
communist governments the oncedomineering kremlin stood by 
offering restrained encouragement 
having told the world for 2 years the soviets would let their 
east bloc partners set their own political courses president 
mikhail s gorbachev is now demonstrating he meant what he said 
gorbachevs 1987 pledge was met with skepticism from 
czechoslovakia to washington but he has reiterated and 
strengthened his position as he developed his new thinking in 
foreign policy and promoted his concept of a common european 
home for all nations on the continent 
western analysts first saw the proposal as a tactic to isolate 
the united states from nato allies in western europe but it now is 
apparent gorbachev wants to draw back the iron curtain to give the 
east access to more prosperous western markets and a security built 
on common interests rather than military deterrence 
the soviet union crushed reform movements in hungary in 1956 and 
in czechoslovakia in 1968 and backed the polish governments 
crackdown on solidarity in 1981 
but gorbachev discarded the socalled brezhnev doctrine 
which justified intervention in restive communist satellites to 
prevent any retreat from socialism 
the kremlin once would have seen reforms like those in hungary 
which is moving toward a multiparty democracy or in east germany 
which threw open its borders to the west as impermissible threats 
to its ideological grip on its warsaw pact allies 
but gorbachev has espoused variety in socialism since he came 
to power in march 1985 he has been taking ideology out of 
relations with both east and west 
each country has its own specifics and foreign parties 
determine their political course with due regard for national 
conditions he said during an april 1987 visit to prague 
czechoslovakia 
he expanded on the theme seven months later 
unity does not mean being identical or uniform he said in 
moscow we have also become convinced that socialism does not 
and cannot have a model with which all socialist systems are 
compared 
new thinking as gorbachev has defined it means soviet 
foreign policy is based on mutual respect among nations and he has 
abandoned the traditional communist line that it is the duty of 
communist countries to sponsor and support likeminded revolutions 
elsewhere 
he told the united nations in december there can be unity in 
diversity 
if we assert this politically if we reaffirm our adherence to 
freedom of choice then there is no room for the view that some 
live on earth by virtue of divine will while others are here quite 
by chance he said 
gennady i gerasimov the glib soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman has dubbed the new approach to relations with eastern 
europe the sinatra doctrine named for singer frank sinatra 
whose signature song boasts i did it my way 
there are risks in unleashing the allies who since world war ii 
have formed a buffer between the soviet union and western europe 
but the kremlin cannot afford to continue propping up its partners 
militarily and economically with its own economy in shambles 
gorbachev has pursued disarmament and cut military expenditures 
unilaterally withdrawing troops from eastern europe and asia he 
has focused on putting the soviet unions political and economic 
houses in order and has encouraged his allies to do the same 
the risk of gorbachevs handsoff policy is that the soviet 
union will lose its frontline defenses in east germany and 
elsewhere exposing itself to another devastating land war like the 
two suffered so far this century the kremlin has made it clear 
therefore that its tolerance for reform does not extend to the 
redrawing of national boundaries and particularly the 
reunification of germany 
the east bloc countries face a deadline of sorts for joining the 
world economic community the scheduled integration of western 
europes economies in 1992 threatens to widen the already obvious 
gap between the standards of living in eastern and western europe 
as ideological barriers fall help could come from western 
countries that have been reluctant to lend a hand to the repressive 
regimes they considered a threat to their own security and progress 
the role of the west in helping encourage development in the 
hardpressed east bloc countries is expected to be discussed next 
month when president bush meets gorbachev bush said the 
fastmoving developments in east germany give the meeting even 
more importance bush has said he wants to learn from gorbachev 
about the dynamic change in eastern europe 
gerasimov said the meeting can just be the end of the cold 
war

the democrats victories in the oddyear 
elections have alerted both parties that abortion will dominate 
debate in some major 1990 contests with the potential to drown out 
other issues 
when youve got a prochoice and an antichoice candidate 
running youre going to be hearing about it said michele davis 
head of the republican governors association who saw both her 
candidates fall victim to the abortion issue last tuesday 
in the wake of the gubernatorial loses in new jersey and 
virginia some republicans voiced alarm over the potential impact 
next year when 34 senate seats and 36 governors offices are up 
for election republican officials sought to show they were not an 
antiabortion party even though the gop platform has been strongly 
antiabortion 
well be supporting our prochoice candidates as much as our 
prolife candidates said mary matalin the republican national 
committees chief of staff 
while supporters of keeping abortion legal were celebrating 
their victories however political strategists on both sides of 
the issue were cautioning that public sentiment remains divided on 
abortion polls conducted for both parties showed voter concern 
about extremes on both sides of the issue 
both sides say their goal in the 1990 elections will be to try 
to frame the debate early so that the battle is fought using terms 
and words most favorable to their side 
in virginias race for governor for instance republican j 
marshall coleman was put on the defensive by democrat l douglas 
wilders depiction of him as an extremist who opposed abortion even 
in cases of rape or incest coleman spent the campaign trying to 
distance himself from that position which he took during his gop 
primary 
both sides and even antiabortion leaders such as david osteen 
of the national right to life committee acknowledge that on rape 
and incest polls show the public supports the option of abortion 
president bush says he supports abortions in those cases even 
though he vetoed a bill allowing federal funding of abortions for 
poor women in those instances 
osteen said the antiabortion side wants to shift the debate 
onto other areas such as requiring the consent or notification of 
parents when a minor girl seeks an abortion and to attack the vast 
majority of legal abortions as amounting to a form of birth control 
if those terms become the focus of debate some pollsters 
believe antiabortion candidates may stand a better chance of 
attracting majorities 
whichever army gets to choose the terrain dictates to some 
extent the outcome of the battle said charlie cook analyst and 
author of a political newsletter 
if the code words become abortion on demand parental 
consent and abortion as a form of birth control or abortion 
in order to select the sex of a child then the terrain on which 
the battle is fought is going to be completely different cook 
said 
some prochoice groups say they want to push for candidates who 
will oppose state laws requiring the consent of parents for a 
minors abortions even while they acknowledge voter sentiment is 
against them 
parental consent is going to be a new twist thats going to be 
played out in the next election cycle said sharon rodine 
president of the national womens political caucus were going 
to have to do an education effort as the next step of this issue 
polls conducted for democrat wilder in virginia a narrow 
winner subject to a recount showed that by the end of the 
campaign a clear majority said they supported the prochoice 
position said frank greer wilders media consultant 
but greer cautions that those drawing lessons from the virginia 
race should be aware of how wilders approach was carefully drawn 
to make his position appear to be the conservative one 
his ads described the issue as keeping government out of an 
individuals personal life and used flagwaving imagery and 
conservative rhetoric that just as easily could have accompanied an 
ad opposing guncontrol laws 
i think it is a mistake for candidates to run as proabortion 
candidates said greer its much better to run as a candidate 
wanting to keep government out of this decision 
people have to do it in a sophisticated way he added it 
is still not an easy issue to deal with in the public arena but if 
you do i will guarantee you can run in any corner of the country 
on keeping governmental control out of individuals lives 
polls conducted for the republican party by pollster robert 
teeter found plurality support for a prochoice position matalin 
said a national teeter poll shortly before the election showed 36 
percent to 40 percent favoring abortion rights with 26 percent to 
30 percent taking an antiabortion position and 30 percent in the 
middle inclined to favor some but not all restrictions on abortion 
for republicans the immediate worry is that the issue threatens 
to undermine inroads the party has made with young voters and women 
who were attracted to the party in the reagan years on economic 
issues 
republicans enjoyed great success in winning governors offices 
during the last decade by stressing management and competence over 
ideology abortion some republicans fear may push those quieter 
issues aside in favor of ideology 
those things are going to get drowned out said davis

us roman catholic bishops have become a 
political force to be reckoned with in the newly steppedup 
abortion debate appealing to catholic politicians and discussing 
sanctions against catholic abortion rights advocates 
leaders of the nations largest religious group termed abortion 
the fundamental human rights issue of the day in their first 
meeting since the supreme court ruling giving states greater 
discretion to limit legalized abortion 
in an attempt to close ranks on the issue among their 53 
millionmember flock the bishops also declared no catholic can 
responsibly take a prochoice stand 
we have a tremendous amount of work to do said cardinal 
john oconnor of new york newly elected chairman of the bishops 
committee for prolife activities in my judgment were at a 
turning point in the country we could go one way or the other 
while the prelates said the ruling in webster vs reproductive 
health services offers hope for an eventual reversal of the 1973 
court decision legalizing abortion they acknowledged the recent 
decision has galvanized abortion rights advocates to defeat 
politicians who do not support permissive abortion 
on the day the bishops passed their resolution democratic 
candidates who made abortion a campaign issue won the gubernatorial 
race in new jersey and apparently won in virginia some gop leaders 
have since said their party needs to be more tolerant of republican 
candidates who back abortion rights 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles called on catholics to be 
courageous even heroic in our beliefs as they stand 
increasingly alone in publicly opposing abortion 
we may be in reality the only moral conscience in our country 
willing to be proclaimed publicly he said 
the catholic church has had some success persuading active 
churchgoers to accept limits on abortion 
the notre dame study of catholic parish life found 69 percent of 
respondents saying abortion is acceptable only under certain 
extreme circumstances such as a threat to the mothers life rape 
or incest onequarter of the respondents said abortion is never 
acceptable 
when asked to rank support for church policy and positions on 13 
issues the secondhighest amount of support was expressed for the 
church remaining strong in its opposition to abortion 
but other polls showing little difference in abortion views 
among the general population of catholics and other groups 
indicated stronger action may be needed 
over the last 16 years by and large weve not been a 
smashing success on this issue said auxiliary bishop austin 
vaughan of new york 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago the outgoing chairman of 
the bishops committee for prolife activities said the church 
needs to study what should be done about catholics who advocate 
abortion rights 
the bishops did not take a stand on whether penalties should be 
invoked against those catholics and the conference president said 
ecclesiastical sanctions such as excommunication could backfire 
i dont think it would help us one bit to change americas way 
of thinking it may have an adverse effect said archbishop john 
may of st louis 
but the bishops made it clear that catholic politicians would no 
longer go unchallenged if they adopted a personally opposed but 
stance to justify not working for government curbs on 
abortion 
we urge public officials especially catholics to advance 
these goals in recognition of their moral responsibility to protect 
the weak and defenseless among us the bishops said 
the issue first drew attention in 1984 when oconnor crticized 
democratic vicepresidential candidate geraldine ferraro for 
sidestepping the abortion issue 
new york gov mario cuomo later that year defended catholic 
legislators who did not pursue abortion curbs saying public 
morality is a matter of prudential political judgment 
bishop james malone of youngstown ohio responded two years 
later that the idea there can be a dividing line between personal 
morality and public morality raises a thoroughly frightening 
prospect if taken literally 
at the bishops meeting last week bernardin said he had grave 
difficulty with politicians who say they are personally opposed 
to abortion but take no action 
if one considers abortion the taking of innocent human life 
bernardin said it seems to me you have to do something about 
it

here are some notes by ap correspondent hanns 
neuerbourg from a visit behind the berlin wall shortly after it was 
built in 1961 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the east berlin worker said he was quite happy 
with his garden on the edge of the city and a nominal rent and that 
about the only thing he was missing was ein bisschen freiheit 
a little bit of freedom 
the teacher told of orders to question his children about their 
parents political views adding that every morning when i look 
into the mirror i could spit at my face 
many images come to mind in leafing through yellowed notebooks 
and clippings 
there was of course the armed east german soldier who jumped 
over the barbed wire that was replaced a few days later by the 
wall and whose photograph taken by an ap reporter hit front 
pages worldwide also the young mother holding her baby as she 
jumped from an upper window in east berlin into a safety net strung 
on the western side by her husband and fellow firemen 
or nikita khrushchev whose name was on the first page of the 
east berlin guestbook for official delegates who were led to what 
was termed the antifascist wall of protection but also the 
east german interpreter accompanying a french communist party 
delegation inspecting the wall and then seizing the occasion to 
scale the wall to freedom 
or the us and soviet tanks facing each other at a breathtaking 
moment when one shot across the line might have triggered world 
war iii or the bodies of wouldbe refugees dragged back by the 
east german guards who shot them 
or scores of other stories about what was branded a mockery of 
human rights by thenvice president lyndon johnson when he flew 
into berlin in august 1961 six days after the wall went up 
by then nearly a quarter of a million people had crossed into 
the west most by just taking a subway ride from east to west 
berlin a few made it to the east if only temporarily chiefly to 
get married because of an east german law allowing 18yearolds to 
marry without their parents consent 
in leipzig east germany a few weeks after the wall had gone 
up the traditional trade fair opened without most of the western 
exhibitors the communist party daily invited those who defied the 
boycott to witness the fair as a proof of the strength and unity 
of the socialist camp 
for 9 of 10 east germans the wall and barbed wire then were out 
of view except for those who dared ignore a ban on watching 
western tv 
out of sight out of mind remarked one leipziger said 
another at the leipzig fair i have my contacts and i could still 
cross into the west but i wont because one day west germany also 
will be communist anyway

guns a floodlit mine field and the blood of those trying to cross 
the berlin wall a gray symbol of the cold war 
against this obstacle which sealed the division of a divided 
city were hurled eggs tomatoes and tnt the wall absorbed curses 
and graffiti and the ritualistic invective of visiting presidents 
and prime ministers 
in 28 years 5000 east germans escaped over the wall and 191 
people died trying on may 23 1987 the border guards carried away 
a lifeless body maybe this person whose name is not known was the 
last to die 
east germans voting with their feet as western politicians 
like to say caused the wall to be built on aug 13 1961 it ended 
a hemorrhage

john f kennedy was president when the wall went up he was 
spending the weekend at hyannisport mass secretary of state dean 
rusk issued a statement limitation on travel within berlin is a 
violation of the fourpower status of berlin 
kennedy did nothing about dismantling the wall reasoning that 
such a step would provoke a confrontation with the soviets anyway 
the east germans would just rebuild it 
two years later kennedy stood on the western side of the wall 
and hurled bricks of oratory at the communists 
a thrilled shout arose from 150000 west berliners when kennedy 
said in german ich bin ein berliner i am a berliner 
every president since has called on the communists to tear down 
the wall 
ronald reagan was there june 12 1987 addressing himself 
directly to soviet leader mikhailk gorbachev reagan said if you 
seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern 
europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate open 
this gate tear down this wall 
speeches like that replied the east german news agency adn 
will not make the wall go away but on the contrary will cause it 
to grow higher 
in berlin 13 months ago american diplomat john c whitehead 
called the wall a gray monstrous snake the west german 
newspaper bild called it inhumanity cast in stone bondage poured 
into cement

long before the wall was built berlin had become a focus of 
eastwest confrontation after the defeat of nazi germany in 1945 
the city was divided into american french british and 
sovietcontrolled sectors the western powers were assigned land 
and air corridors for transportation to berlin across east germany 
but three years later the soviets abruptly cut off overland 
access to west berlin to keep the city alive the united states 
and its allies launched the berlin airlift on june 26 1948 
by the time the soviets halted their blockade and the airlift 
ended on sept 30 1949 more than 277000 planeloads of supplies 
totalling about 2 million tons of food coal and other goods had 
been delivered to west berlin

east german communist leader erich honecker put the wall up 28 
years ago and the wall brought erich honecker down last month 
none saw its swift demise last aug 13 a west german official 
ottfried henning predicted the wall might come down by the end of 
the century 
last january honecker said it would still be standing in 50 
years and even in 100 years if the reason for its existence are 
not set aside 
the reason for its existence 
at the time the east german explanation was that it was needed 
to prevent a planned attack from the west on the day of its 
construction the newspaper berlin zeitung said as the day 
dawned the border was made safe 
in the days before its construction the flow of east germans to 
west german became so great that it threatened to cripple the east 
german economy 
in the days before its symbolic destruction the flow of east 
germans had become so great that the authorities acknowledged they 
had to let their people go if they had any hope of keeping them 
home

defected to west germany gave an interview his message was that 
sometimes even a jack booted trooper listens to his heart 
he said the shoottokill orders had been rescinded but even 
before they were only about 10 percent of the hardcore gungho 
troops would shoot at an unarmed civilian attempting to flee 
but it was a great risk not to shoot he said 
if you let someone escape you go to prison its also very 
risky because you patrol in pairs and you never know what the 
other guy is thinking 
on july 12 1989 turba told his comrades he had problems with 
his motorcycle and needed to take it for a test drive he roared

heating your home with oil or natural gas is 
likely to cost more this winter than last but supplies should be 
adequate industry and government officials say 
a onemonth stretch of unusually cold weather in certain regions 
could however trigger some localized shortages of natural gas to 
industrial and other nonresidential users such as schools and 
businesses the officials said in interviews 
supplies of heating oil used mainly in the northeast are not 
in doubt although prices are expected to be at least a few cents a 
gallon higher than last winter 
the projected rise in heating oil prices is linked to higher 
prices for the petroleum from which the fuel is made natural gas 
prices which currently are lower than a year ago are expected to 
increase as demand rises and local distribution companies pass 
along a projected small increase in their own costs 
the government estimates that retail heating oil prices will 
average about 90 cents a gallon this winter compared with about 82 
cents a gallon a year earlier prices usually vary across regions 
depending on weather patterns and other factors 
about 12 million american homes burn oil for heat and an 
additional 48 million heat with natural gas 
because gas distribution companies are getting more of their 
supply on the spot or noncontract market and less from the 
traditional pipeline contract system price trends and the 
reliability of supplies are getting harder to foresee analysts say 
paul taylor a vice president at anadarko petroleum corp a 
houstonbased gas producer said the number of companies forced to 
temporarily curtail gas shipments to their customers has been 
growing in recent years cutbacks were imposed in parts of 
california and texas on the coldest days two years ago and last 
winter oregon washington new mexico texas and california were 
affected he said 
we look at that as evidence of a growing trend on the coldest 
winter days there just is not enough gas around to meet everyones 
demands he said adding that the main problem is a seasonal 
bottleneck in some pipeline systems 
taylor noted that supply cutbacks are imposed on industrial 
users first and have not yet affected residential users nor are 
they likely to this winter he said 
in a sign that the industry itself is becoming more concerned 
about its capability to deliver adequate supplies of natural gas 
marketers are starting to move away from cheaper monthtomonth 
spot market purchases to the more dependable yet more expensive 
longterm supply contracts said kenneth randolph senior vice 
president and general counsel of the natural gas clearinghouse 
theres still that possibility of running short of gas next 
year or even this year randolph said however the odds weigh 
heavily in favor of a stable market at least for the coming winter 
unless the weather is exceptionally cold for an extended period in 
both producing and consuming states he said 
the federal energy information administration this month 
slightly increased its forecast for natural gas prices but says 
consumers shouldnt worry about supplies 
the agencys latest forecast says residential natural gas prices 
are likely to rise about 2 percent this winter to an average per 
thousand cubic feet of 557 compared with 548 in the same 
period last year 
commercial inventories of natural gas are higher now than a year 
ago and despite possible pipeline bottlenecks there is little 
reason to expect a serious supply problem said calvin kilgore 
director of the agencys energy markets office 
its a manageable situation he said 
the american gas association a trade group of gas distributors 
and pipeline companies projects a 59 percent jump in residential 
gas prices this winter compared with last year assuming the 
weather is neither unusually harsh nor mild 
the association said that while gas supplies should be adequate 
transportation bottlenecks and weather uncertainties could cause 
prices to move erratically 
during short periods in localized areas this could even 
result in physical delivery constraints on getting gas the 
association said in a recent report

former premier andreas papandreou met with 
his conservative archrival saturday in an effort to form a 
coalition government and end a deepening political deadlock 
although the 40minute meeting with constantine mitsotakis 
failed to create a coalition both leaders agreed a government 
should emerge from the ongoing consultations 
mitsotakis said the pilotless economy deeply mired in 
indecision needed urgent and immediate attention 
it was the second meeting within three days between the 
70yearold papandreou who heads the panhellenic socialist 
movement or pasok and mitsotakis who leads the new democracy 
party they are attempting to find a way to end the political 
crisis created nov 5 when no party won a majority in parliamentary 
elections 
at separate news conferences both leaders expressed the need to 
avoid another round of elections mitsotakis called for an 
allparty administration with a short life a few months and 
made up of technocrats papandreou said an allparty government 
should be of long duration 
papandreou holds a personal grudge against mitsotakis for 
splitting with papandreous father george when he was premier 25 
years ago it was evident from statements by both leaders prior to 
their meeting saturday that they would be unable to find common 
ground for future cooperation 
the 71yearold mitsotakis on friday gave up a threeday 
presidential mandate to form a government after no agreement was 
reached with papandreou and harilaos florakis who leads the 
communistdominated coalition of the left and progress party 
papandreou was then given a mandate by president christos 
sartzetakis to try to form a coalition 
the former premier told reporters he will consult florakis on 
sunday and propose that the progressive democratic forces form 
a government but he sounded pessimistic an agreement could be 
reached on a coalition 
the constitution stipulates that if papandreou is unable to form 
a government by monday florakis receives a presidential mandate 
if florakis fails sartzetakis as a last resort calls on the 
political leaders to set aside their differences and form an 
allparty government 
if this bears no fruit greeks will be called to the polls again 
before christmas 
the deadlock developed when new democracy won 148 parliamentary 
seats three short of an absolute majority in the 300seat 
parliament in last sundays election pasok won 128 seats the 
coalition 21 and independents took three places it was the second 
election within five months on june 18 a national election also 
failed to produce a winner 
there has been no government to draft a budget for 1990 and the 
economy and the state machinery have been reeling under the 
uncertainty 
with a cash shortage confronting the public sector central bank 
governor dimitris chalikias on thursday ordered commercial banks to 
stop loans to the private sector until january greek businessmen 
demanded chalikias decision be rescinded

the election of new york citys first black 
mayor was a sweet moment for heyward davenport but 30 years in the 
civil rights movement has taught him to look at the big picture on 
election night 89 davenport liked what he saw 
the harlem political club leader stood before a portable tv and 
watched david dinkins triumph he saw black mayors elected for the 
first time in seattle new haven conn and durham nc he saw l 
douglas wilder claim victory in virginia where he will be the 
nations first elected black governor if his slim lead holds up to 
an expected recount 
new york is the epitome of urban america and virginia of the 
old confederacy said davenport who watched the returns at a 
basement party in harlem this sends a message to all america 
that its ok now weve gone beyond color barriers 
theres a sense of something new happening tonight 
there also was a sense of history tuesday the rev percy high 
of mount vernon baptist church in durham nc said he felt it 
when pulling the lever for the victorious chester jenkins 
it was long overdue said jenkins finally this town 
becomes a town of dignity and respectability durham is finally 
catching up with the other major communities in the state 
raleigh charlotte and chapel hill have all elected black mayors in 
the past 
jim parker who runs a shoeshine stand in new haven conn has 
known soontobe mayor john daniels for years as one of his 
customers parker a resident of a public housing project believes 
a black mayor will bring a new perspective to running the city 
hell be able to go into the neighborhoods that really need 
him and where the problems are and theyll give him respect 
said parker being from these neighborhoods will make it easier 
for him to talk to people 
in seattle voters who put norm rice in the mayors seat also 
expect positive results mary mcgraw who turned out for the 
mayorelects victory tour of several neighborhoods last week said 
his election gives the black community a foot in the door 
i think seattle needed a black mayor to encourage black people 
to achieve said ms mcgraw 22 a hairdresser norm rice he 
kept the faith he kept going 
for davenport and thousands of other blacks there was 
validation for their years of struggle for equality during the 
early 1960s davenport helped lead civil rights marches through 
charlotte a time he recalled vividly while celebrating the dinkins 
victory 
despite the progress davenport said he had wondered if a day 
like tuesday would ever come new york was among the last of the 
nations largest cities to elect a black mayor chicago los 
angeles philadelphia detroit and baltimore preceded it 
even 10 years ago no one could have predicted whats 
happened said davenport it was beyond fathoming 
his feelings were echoed by carl nesfield 63 who arrived early 
tuesday night for a cafes promised victory party for dinkins 
this is historic a lot of people in new york didnt think 
theyd ever see this day up until a couple of years ago i was 
one said nesfield 
the thrill of groundbreaking victory was tempered in some cases 
by the reality of intractable problems like aids homelessness and 
drugs in new haven departing mayor biagio dilieto conceded 
daniels faced a horrendous litany of woes 
i really feel good about his election but daniels inherited 
a lot of problems said anderson curtis 26 its as if the 
administration got out when the ship was sinking just like in new 
york city 
durham resident jerri perry needed some help in identifying 
mayorelect jenkins she didnt vote nov 7 she was preoccupied 
with avoiding eviction from the apartment where she lives with her 
four children 
maybe hell make the community and make everything around 
better the 37yearold mrs perry said doubtfully it hurts so 
bad i hope he does do something about housing 
yet there was a feeling of confidence among the black 
communities in each of the divergent cities that their mayors would 
succeed nesfield said dinkins the citys 106th mayor would make 
a difference in new york where killings of black youths by white 
gangs in howard beach and bensonhurst have stirred racial tensions 
david dinkins will bring respect to this city i think white 
people will look at black people differently said nesfield 
the attitude will change

the virginia legislature laid out a pitifully thin welcome mat 
when lawrence douglas wilder arrived at richmonds capitol square 
nearly 20 years ago even so in the minds of some reluctant 
colleagues that day he promptly tripped over it 
wilder then the only black elected to the state senate since 
reconstruction had barely taken his oath when he implored 
replacement of the official state song noting its lyrics extol 
plantation life under old massa and refer to the commonwealth 
as where this old darkies heart am longed to go 
the words burned in my ears said wilder his words in 
turn burned the ears of his white brethren he was the only member 
of the senate who was not invited that year to the annual bash for 
legislators at the exclusive commonwealth club where he had once 
worked as a busboy 
some things havent changed in the old dominion in the two 
decades since carry me back to old virginia is still the state 
song though rarely sung but doug wilder wont find the footing 
nearly so cruel in january when barring an unexpected change in 
last tuesdays vote count he will take his next oath at the state 
capitol the finest red carpet will be out for the new governor 
preliminary vote totals show that wilder a 58yearold 
democrat beat j marshall coleman a white republican by the 
threadthin margin of 6582 votes 
coleman has said he will demand a recount assuming it confirms 
wilder as the winner he will be the first elected black governor 
in the history of the republic 
it would be naive to suggest that some people didnt vote for or 
against wilder on the basis of race but the marvelous thing is 
that no one in virginia a state ruled by segregationists a 
generation ago made race an issue in this campaign nasty as it 
was on other fronts 
political analysts will have a field day postulating how 
virginia became the first state to elect a black governor not 
california where tom bradley came whiskerclose in 1982 then 
faded in 1986 and not michigan where republican william lucas 
also lost in 1986 
prochoice abortion activists who campaigned hard for wilder 
with newfound voice and financial muscle will trumpet his victory 
as evidence of a shifting political tide so will black activists 
and national democratic leaders still smarting from the reagan and 
bush landslides 
but any simplistic explanation simply will not do for that 
would ignore wilders groundbreaking achievements on a long 
patient climb to power over two decades not to mention the 
remarkable social and political metamorphosis of the entire state 
the old dominion it is sometimes said is now the new dominion 
wilder has been a relentless leavenothingtochance 
campaigner and it could be argued that 1985 the year he won the 
lieutenant governorship marked his most important political 
passage white party leaders had pleaded with him to withdraw from 
the race lest he sink the ticket headed by gerald baliles the 
governor he now succeeds instead wilder began a 3719mile auto 
tour of the state handshaking his way through 338 cities and towns 
and all 95 of the states counties 
twothirds of his 750000 war chest that year was spent on 
television ads including one in which a beefy white policeman from 
a small virginia town delivered the endorsement of the fraternal 
order of police wilder won with 518 percent of the vote 
he raised 10 times as much money for this years governors 
race which was a sweatsoaked reprise of 1985 he retraced his 
path into virtually every country store cafe and town hall some 
advised him to stay out of remote allwhite regions people said 
i should never go out there with those people because id never be 
seen again he recalled i go out there to those people and 
they say welcome home doug wilder 
in farmville wilder renewed acquaintances with townspeople 
beneath their monument to confederate heroes and was led around by 
robert bruce a white attorney who has never lived anywhere else 
as bruce put it folks are going to vote for him but they arent 
going to talk about it they arent going to put a wilder bumper 
sticker on the truck 
that suited wilder fine his record is one of living within the 
establishment while selectively challenging it knowing when to 
threaten when to charm he was never a street activist for civil 
rights he did not support jesse jacksons bid for the democratic 
presidential nomination in 1984 or 1988 and spurned offers from 
jackson and other black activists to campaign for him 
to those who think he has been too accommodating to the white 
majority he had a standard rejoinder jesse runs to inspire i 
run to win 
it may not have seemed that way in the beginning he arrived at 
the legislature already having risen from busboy to millionaire 
criminal lawyer wearing an afro and there was the early brouhaha 
over the state song 
over time the afro gave way to a straighter silver mane his 
flamboyant attire to bankers suits someone said to me in 1985 
that when he saw me wearing wingtips he knew i was really 
serious he said 
by then wilder was a committee chairman and one of the most 
influential senators in the legislature he shepherded an array of 
antidiscrimination laws and won a long battle to declare a holiday 
honoring king although whites insisted that the day be shared 
with robert e lee and stonewall jackson 
wilders rise after all took place in the city that once 
served as the capital of the confederacy in a state that was 
dominated for four decades by the segregationist political machine 
of harry f byrd sr a poll tax kept blacks effectively 
disenfranchised until the mid1960s when the 24th amendment to the 
constitution and the federal voting rights act of 1965 forced the 
state to change

the first vatican conference on aids will 
examine ways to prevent the disease by promoting changes in moral 
and sexual behavior and not by condoning the use of condoms 
officials said saturday 
to provide or advise condoms condom after condom by states 
wherever they are is a hypocritical act said archbishop fiorenzo 
angelini the chief organizer of the conference which begins 
monday 
it is a disloyal act he added it is an uneducated act 
and it does not serve as an obstacle to the disease but allows it 
to develop more than one can imagine 
the vatican has made it clear in the past that it disapproves of 
the use of condoms as a means of slowing the spread of the deadly 
disease which can be contracted through sexual acts but 
angelinis comments were among the strongest public assertions to 
date on the issue by a vatican official 
angelini president of the pontifical council for pastoral 
assistance to health care workers spoke at a news conference 
presenting the threeday international congress titled to live 
why 
more than 1000 delegates from 85 countries including some of 
the worlds foremost experts on aids are scheduled to attend 
angelini who called aids a scourge of humanity said 
talking about condoms is to trivialize the problem it is not 
possible to treat such traumatic tragic things in such a way 
in an apparent reference to condom manufacturers and 
advertisers he warned of really dirty speculators who profit and 
benefit from the tragedy 
the use of condoms in fighting aids has been a delicate issue 
for the roman catholic church which opposes all forms of 
artificial birth control 
on thursday us bishops dropped earlier conditional support 
for condom education in schools and urged that aids prevention 
instead emphasize chastity 
bonifacio honings a moral theology professor at the lateran 
pontifical university who joined angelini at the news conference 
rejected a suggestion that using condoms could be considered a 
lesser evil than infecting ones partner with aids by not using 
them 
you cant reduce an evil by another evil he said it 
doesnt apply 
angelini and honings said prevention of aids must start with a 
change in moral and sexual behavior many aids victims are 
intravenous drug users and homosexuals and the officials 
reaffirmed the churchs condemnation of homosexual activity 
the solution is not in a clean syringe or in a condom 
honings said we must help the person get away from his behavior 
through his moral and spiritual capacity 
the vatican conference is intended to give a message of love 
hope and trust to aids victims angelini said the conference 
opens monday with an address by cardinal john oconnor of new york 
the pope plans to speak on wednesday at the conference

prochoice activists were prepared to stage 
more than 1000 demonstrations across the nation on sunday 
including an enormous rally at the lincoln memorial in what they 
say will be the largest show of support for abortion rights in 
american history 
emboldened by the election tuesday of prochoice candidates in 
two gubernatorial and several mayoral races organizers of the 
national mobilization for womens lives anticipated an overall 
turnout of hundreds of thousands of people in locations ranging 
from kennebunk maine to anchorage alaska 
the 1989 election season just ended with spectacular 
success molly yard president of the national organization for 
women declared on the eve of the new campaign this 
demonstration marks the beginning of the 1990 election cycle we 
are not going to lose one day in the fight to elect candidates who 
will secure abortion rights for womens lives 
most of the demonstrations are scheduled for sunday beginning 
with a sunrise thousand points of light vigil in kennebunk 
maine near president bushs family retreat in adjacent 
kennebunkport at that ceremony we will say america stands for 
choice president bush and your demagoguing cannot turn us 
around according to faye wattleton president of planned 
parenthood 
bush who continues to support a proposed constitutional 
amendment to ban abortion in most cases planned to spend the day 
at camp david md 
ms wattleton will be joined in kennebunk by entertainer polly 
bergen and kate michelman director of the national abortion rights 
action league before flying on to events elsewhere in the country 
the finale will be a sunset thousand points of light vigil in 
san francisco that phrase originally was coined by bush to 
describe the compassion and energy of americas social volunteers 
in washington organizers expected tens of thousands of people 
for a rally at the lincoln memorial where several republican 
notables will join 15 democratic members of congress the rev 
jesse jackson leaders of feminist groups and a dozen hollywood 
entertainers on the platform 
the republican speakers were to include sen bob packwood of 
oregon rep connie morella of maryland and mary dent crisp 
former cochair of the republican national committee and now head 
of the national coalition of republicans for choice 
among other scheduled events 
an oldfashioned tent revival in new orleans featuring gospel 
music jazz cajun food and celebrities morgan fairchild and blythe 
danner 
a rally in jefferson city mo capital of the state which 
enacted abortion restrictions recently upheld by the supreme court 
and where sharon rodine president of the national womens 
political caucus will be joined by celebrities susan sarandon and 
tim robbins 
similar rallies or vigils in most major cities and on scores of 
college campuses in anchorage two republican and two democratic 
candidates for governor all prochoice were to address a 
gathering at the performing arts center in phoenix a prochoice 
banner was to be flown over the nfl football game between the 
cardinals and the dallas cowboys 
on saturday now and other groups dispatched 480 volunteers to a 
southeast washington abortion clinics to counter a typical 
operation rescue raid by about 250 fervent abortion foes 
police said they arrested 212 people after they broke through 
police lines and attempted to blockade the building now 
spokeswoman tiny hoff said none of the now demonstrators who 
sought to clear a path for patients was among those arrested 
police werent sure of the breakdown 
also saturday now established a 24hour honor guard at a 
temporary unknown womens memorial near the washington 
monument in remembrance of women who have died from illegal or 
selfinduced abortions the structure made of wood with a 
synthetic marble coating resembles the tomb of the unknown soldier 
ms yard and other organizers said that because the effort is 
spread across the nation the rally at the lincoln monument on 
sunday likely would not match the turnout of a prochoice 
demonstration at the capitol last april she claimed that throng 
totaled more than 600000 but that was twice the estimate of most 
news organizations and police officials

the bernauer strasse where east german workers 
smashed through the berlin wall to make a new crossing was one of 
the most tragic stretches of the barrier but also the scene of a 
spectacular escape to freedom 
on aug 22 1961 nine days after the communists began building 
the berlin wall ida siekmann 59 died when she fell from the 
second floor of her house onto bernauer strasse while trying to 
jump to freedom 
on oct 4 1961 student bernd luenser died after a scuffle with 
communist guards on the roof of another building on the street 
luenser missed the blanket held by west berliners and crashed to 
his death 
on saturday thousands of east berliners poured through the wall 
on the bernauer strasse and smiling communist guards held the gate 
open 
some who crossed were mindful of the tragic deaths on this spot 
that is just terrible terrible said a 52yearold east 
berlin woman who had crossed for the first time since the wall went 
up it just goes through and through you right under the skin 
she said with tears in her eyes 
while the section of wall along the bernauer strasse provided 
one of the most tragic chapters in the division of berlin it also 
was the scene of one of the most famous escapes in the history of 
the wall 
on oct 5 1964 23 men 31 women and three children crawled to 
freedom through a tunnel 11 feet underground between a shed in 
strelitzer strasse in east berlin and bernauer strasse 97 on the 
western side 
there was an exchange of gunfire when east german soldiers 
noticed some of the escapees and one guard was killed all 57 east 
berliners made it safely through the tunnel 
the wall at this point was one of berlins cruelest divisions 
sundering two of the citys most historic districts wedding and 
prenzlauer berg placing the former in the west the latter in the 
east 
the spirit of berlin lives in both prenzlauer berg is one of 
east berlins most lively districts site of the gethesemane church 
that provided a rallying point for the prodemocracy movement that 
has engulfed east germany 
wedding too is famous for the earthy working class humor 
coursing from morning until night through its eckkneipen the 
corner bars that are dear to every real berliner 
dramatic pictures shot at bernauer strasse are part of all 
berlin guide books a woman dangling from a window as communist 
officials try to pull her back while a west berliner holds on to 
her legs another woman jumping to the west and landing on a safety 
net held by west berliners 
when the east germans poured through on saturday one of the 
first things they saw was a line of wooden crosses that dot the 
bernauer strasse along the wall on the western side ten people are 
known to have died there a small stone monument lists their names

reformists said saturday no meaningful 
change can come to bulgaria unless the new leadership relinquishes 
the communist partys divine right to power 
todor zhivkov 78 stepped down friday after 35 years as party 
chief and was replaced by petar mladenov who served as foreign 
minister for nearly two decades and is considered more open to 
change mladenov is 53 
if the communist party is shortsighted enough not to drop 
article 1 paragraph 2 of the constitution then no radical change 
will be possible said petar beron a zoology professor and a 
leader of the ecological group ecoglasnost 
the paragraph gives the party the leading role in bulgaria 
they must give up their divine right that we are here 
forever beron told reporters in his small office at the 
national museum of natural history 
rumen vodenicharov who leads the independent committee for the 
protection of human rights championed freedom of speech less 
censorship and disbanding of the allpervasive secret police 
zhivkov must be publicly accused and punished for his serious 
mistakes vodenicharov a research chemist told the associated 
press 
he said zhivkovs harsh treatment of the 15 million ethnic 
turks in bulgaria was his most serious mistake 
mladenovs handling of the turkish issue which is now our 
biggest problem will be a litmus test of whether he is a 
reformer he said 
vodenicharov disclosed that several independent groups were 
sending a telegram to mladenov expressing support for the change in 
leadership and announcing a rally in downtown sofia on monday 
afternoon 
in principle we welcome the changeover as the beginning of 
radical changes he said at the same time we would like to 
warn the new leader that our position remains firm and close to all 
international human rights agreements the bulgarian government 
has signed 
he and kostadin georgiev a philosopher said the question 
remained whether the new party leader could break with his 
political past after all georgiev said mladenov is the 
product of this system 
beron said mladenov is perhaps the best choice of the present 
set of people he is much better educated than zhivkov and has 
international experience 
mladenov could try to save the whole party machinery from 
crumbling by removing some of the most unpopular people he said 
a new plenary session of the central committee is expected soon 
and probably will approve other changes in the top party ranks to 
strengthen mladenovs position the activists said 
bulgaria is not yet ready for pluralism but should now be 
prepared for it beron said he added that there were many 
thoughtful people in the country who could develop political 
programs 
two new independent organizations have been formed this month 
activists reported adding to more than a dozen already campaigning 
for human rights and democratic reform 
the priests union of orthodox clerics banned in 1957 was 
reorganized wednesday and former political prisoners in plovdiv 
bulgarias secondlargest city established the club of people 
sentenced under socialism they said 
activists claim 200 political prisoners are held in bulgaria a 
nation of 9 million people

paul cluse a tall black man with a touch 
of gray in his hair speaks flawless english he also speaks 
flawless french his first language and he has a gripe in both 
its not that we want to take anything away from the cajun 
culture said cluse a creole its just that we have seen much 
that has been adopted as cajun and needs to be claimed again as 
ours 
cluse 46 is one of the founders of creole inc an 
organization aimed at helping the 400000 frenchspeaking blacks in 
southwestern louisiana find their roots and preserve their culture 
and stress how it is distinct from that of the cajuns 
today many use the term creole for anybody black or white who 
traces his ancestry to louisianas colonial period but cluse uses 
the term speficially for frenchspeaking descendents of settlers 
from france spain west africa or the caribbean the cajuns on 
the other hand are descendants of people who traveled to 
southwestern louisiana from canada 
cluse makes the analogy this way a good gumbo takes a lot of 
ingredients we want to make sure everything is in the pot this 
area has a lot of flavors a lot of essences we are one of them 
although his group stresses the culture of black creoles there 
are whites who can also rightfully claim the creole label he said 
its difficult to separate everything because even though the 
races were separate they were mixed but not too long ago things 
like gumbo and dirty rice were creole now everything is being 
called cajun we want people to remember the black frenchspeaking 
people here he said 
some black creoles were slaves during louisianas colonial era 
and others were gens de couleur libres or free people of color 
black creoles like their white counterparts spoke french went 
to roman catholic churches and considered themselves european in 
many ways 
cluse an elementary school principal did not speak english 
when he entered the first grade and could not read it until he 
repeated the fourth grade 
i played hooky i didnt speak i couldnt understand what 
people were saying to me i spoke french and everyone around me was 
speaking english he said 
that has changed for the regions blacks he said but he thinks 
the swing has gone too far 
i realized my own children dont speak french said cluse 
i was worried that the french part of black history here would be 
lost some people think maybe it should be but we dont deny the 
importance of our african history we just want this as well 
trying to preserve a common heritage for black creoles will be 
difficult according to joseph g tregle jr a retired history 
professor who has spent 40 years studying creoles 
there was a large community of free people of color in 
louisiana during the colonial era tregle said in new orleans 
they related to the indigenous frenchspeaking population 
they grew up in the same language and culture as the whites 
did and related to them far more than they would have to the black 
creoles in the lafayette area black creoles in that area would 
have identified more with their cajun neighbors tregle said 
cluse agrees that there are a lot of overlapping areas in cajun 
and creole culture in the region 
we grew up speaking the same language and the cajuns knew 
about discrimination too youll find crossovers between the two 
groups in a lot of areas but especially in the food we eat and the 
music we make he said 
zydeco the music of the creoles has more rhythm and blues in 
it than cajun music cluse said 
the cajun waltz is shaped as much by the black accordion 
players as it is by the cajuns though he said 
creole inc plans to offer public french classes produce 
videotapes on creole culture for use in schools and help establish 
contact with other countries where the variety of french spoken by 
local blacks is used

riot police used armored vans and tear 
gas saturday in violent clashes with workers students and

in this hightech center ballots from 
last weeks election are still being counted and counted and 
counted 
citizens in the city that is home to harvard university and the 
massachusetts institute of technology log their votes by hand and 
the tally is complicated by a rare system that allows voters to 
rank their selections for city council and school committee in 
order of preference 
the system is a computerage dinosaur and a clerical nightmare 
but everyone agrees its also a good excuse for a party 
its almost a throwback to the days of yore when families 
would sit around the radio and wait for word on the voting and who 
might be the winner said sondra scheir director of the count 
a grammar school gym becomes this towns collective living room 
amid basketball hoops wallmounted steam radiators and 
ptasponsored doughnuts hundreds of residents gather to watch 
their electoral system lumber along 
as the week wears on and the suspense mounts a piano is rolled 
in for a singalong one of the commissioners loves to perform 
and teachers bring their classes by for a look at how the system 
works 
under proportional representation a british import voters are 
asked to rank lists of city council and school candidates in order 
of preference 
this year there were 28 bidders for nine council seats the 
losers are weeded out when they fail to make the quota a 
percentage of the vote arrived at by dividing the total votes by 
the number of seats to be filled plus one 
as the people with the fewest votes are dropped from the race 
their supporters ballots are redistributed to the indicated 
secondchoice and so on until the top nine votegetters are 
established to a roar of applause up to a week or more after the 
yellow paper ballots are cast 
the excitement mounts with every redistribution and the buzz 
of speculation is quite pronounced said scheir who has 
participated in the count for more than a decade 
proportional representation means a candidate can win without a 
majority of firstchoice votes from the 60 percent of the 
communitys 47520 voters who participated in this years election 
pr is a good way to include minority groups in the governing 
of the city because every vote has the potential to make a 
difference said robert r reardon a former school committee 
candidate 
cambridge adopted its quirky electoral system in 1941 both as a 
means of rooting out political patronage and as a promise to newer 
portuguese black hispanic and other minority residents 
the irish used to elect everybody said count commissioner 
edward samp the counts unofficial historian 
its come to be known as the best show in town he said 
but the principal benefit comes not from the event but what the 
event represents 
some residents find the system a bother but not connie jarvis 
who said even though we live in a society where everythings 
supposed to be quick this is worth the wait 
detractors say it not only takes too long for results but 
theres room for sneaking a ballot into the wrong pile 
people watch each other like hawks said patrolman francis 
horgan its incredible but they have to keep an eye out because 
every vote counts

after a decade of viewing vouchers as a 
abomination that could cripple public education liberal democrat 
are willing for the first time to write them into a law in order to 
win new direct federal subsidies for child care 
legislation now on a fast track toward a third showdown with 
president bush on child care would allow states to issue 
certificates or vouchers to lowincome working parents they 
could use to pay the provider of their choice including churches 
to take care of their children 
house democratic leaders agreed last week to sponsor an 
amendment accepting vouchers as part of a 12 billion expansion of 
federal child care efforts in 1990 in a lastditch effort to send a 
bill to the white house before congress adjournment target of 
thanksgiving 
despite fierce opposition from the administration both the 
house and senate have approved separate child care packages while 
virtually identical on many provisions the senate version would 
have permitted vouchers and the house version would not 
bush and other conservatives support vouchers in principle but 
have adamantly opposed increasing direct federal child care 
subsidies other than a modest boost in funds for the preschool 
head start program for disadvantaged 3 and 4yearolds 
so house republicans relented last week when sen orrin hatch 
rutah a conservative on most issues but a maverick supporter of 
more child care subsidies forced the voucher question in a 
housesenate negotiating conference 
to retain support from southern democrats the majority partys 
leaders in the house had instructed the negotiators to accept 
language in the senate version on vouchers for the first time a 
federal law would specifically allow vouchers that are exchangeable 
for federal tax dollars to flow through to a churchoperated 
enterprise 
despite the marching orders the key author of the house 
measure rep dale kildee dmich could muster only a handful of 
votes among members of his own party on the negotiating team 
rep augustus f hawkins dcalif the venerable chairman of the 
house education and labor committee and one of the most unabashed 
liberals in congress cited sharp philosophical differences 
among those of us who have never voted for a voucher 
hawkins was willing to allow but not cast a vote for senate 
language that would allow vouchers in the 750 million portion of 
the bill dealing only with day care subsidies 
he made it clear he was equally willing to let the whole effort 
die on the vine if hatch kept insisting that vouchers also be 
permitted in another part of the bill funneling an additional 300 
million in 1990 to local school boards 
half of that money would be used to start a new combination 
educationday care program for preschool tots the other half 
would subsidize keeping local schools open all day to provide a 
caretaker role as well 
youre trying to take us back to the 19th century when 
education was the province of the churches hawkins told hatch 
this is the 20th century and we have public education were not 
going back to the 19th century 
hatch surrendered on making vouchers part of the education 
portion of the program in exchange for language allowing governors 
in the 10 states with the most rural poverty including utah to 
direct some of the aid away from cities 
youve taken care of the senator from utah but what about 
us protested one farm belt republican on the house team 
that is when hatch who long ago encountered wrath from the 
white house because of his support for child care put house 
negotiators from his own party in an untenable strategic position 
he offered them the same deal vote for the vouchers enabling 
child care sponsors to put their bill on a fast track for a 
showdown with bush and the allocation formulas will be rejiggered 
so their districts too could share more of the bounty 
but to the house republicans that also would have meant 
ignoring marching orders from bush aides relayed through gop house 
leaders to do everything possible to derail the bill whether 
from fast track or slow 
theyre opposed to passing it any time this year or next 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
the house republican negotiators asked for a 5minute recess to 
caucus and ask the partys leaders what to do next 
they never returned leaving democrats and hatch to iron out 
several other minor issues with a promise that house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo would push through a vote on the 
floor to allow a partial use of the vouchers only for daycare 
warehousing that has no education component 
in the interest of the white house politically that was about 
the best they could do under the circumstances a grinning hatch 
said of his house gop counterparts afterwards i think weve got 
their the administrations attention now maybe we can get a bill 
that the president wont veto

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has sent 
president bush a message signaling his support for the changes 
under way in east germany and expressing hope the situation will 
remain calm and peaceful the white house said saturday 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater announced the 
message from moscow after bush dedicated a texas memorial to 
soldiers killed in the vietnam war bush used the ceremony to link 
the sacrifice of americas war dead to the dramatic events taking 
place in eastern europe 
in a statement fitzwater said gorbachev sent an infomal message 
to bush on friday to expess his support for the decisions being 
taken by the new east german leadership he underscored the 
importance of the changes taking place there and expressed the 
hope that the situation will remain calm and peaceful 
aboard air force one en route to washington fitzwater said bush 
will respond to gorbachevs message repeating many of the same 
things he has said as well as offering encouragement for the 
continuation of political and economic reforms 
the soviet message according to the press secretary did not 
mention the upcoming superpower meeting in malta and contained no 
proposals it was more of a general letter 
earlier bush voicing hope of seeing the berlin wall down 
not just with holes in it paused on veterans day to dedicate a 
different wall red granite tablets engraved with the names of the 
3271 texans who died in the vietnam war 
standing in brilliant sunshine surrounded by a sea of flags on 
the texas state fairgrounds the president paid tribute to all 
americans who crossed the oceans to fight for the freedom of 
others and died in two world wars korea and vietnam 
because of them the peaceful ideals of america are now the 
ideals of the world said bush 
look to the very heart of europe to berlin and you will see 
a great truth shining brighter with each passing day the quest for 
freedom is stronger than steel more permanent than concrete 
said bush a decorated combat pilot in world war ii 
earlier in an interview published saturday by four texas 
newspapers bush was asked if he felt an urge to go to berlin to 
see the unfolding events for himself 
id like to see it with the wall down not just holes in it 
he replied i wouldnt like to do it unless i felt that it would 
contribute to peace and democracy in the area 
he said he would not add a stop in berlin on the way to his 
upcoming dec 34 malta summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev unless there were something that developed between now 
and then that would make the presence of the us president 
catalytic for peace or for evolution of democracy 
asked if this is the end of communism bush said 
i think were seeing a disintegration of that form of 
totalitarianism in eastern europe i hope its a contagious disease 
and castro catches it and daniel ortega catches it and perhaps 
general noriega catches it bush said referring to the leaders 
of the three western hemisphere nations most at odds with us 
policy cuba nicaragua and panama 
early in the day the white house released a statement in which 
bush expressed grave concern about the health of imprisoned 
cuban dissident ernesto diaz rodriquez who is on a hunger strike 
and called upon cuban president fidel castro to free all political 
prisoners 
the ceremony for the 25 million memorial drew thousands of 
veterans and their families to view the four tablets set beneath a 
canopy of steel piping with a waterwall and pool behind it off to 
the side by an eternal flame stands a fifth wall with the names 
of 156 texans still listed as missing in action

black and white red and brown almost a quarter of the name on 
this memorial are hispanic

marine sons edward and dale in vietnam and later with his wife 
barbara joined mrs mcwright in viewing the granite tablets

thank you mr president for coming

moslem activists who hold most seats in 
the new parliament insist they have no plans for an islamic 
revolution here but they will seek bans on alcohol and television 
shows like threes company 
the fundamentalist moslem brotherhood captured 25 of the 80 
seats in wednesdays poll jordans first nationwide parliamentary 
election since 1967 eleven more seats were won by other islamic 
factions or parties closely associated with the brotherhood 
some other deputies sympathize with many of the brotherhoods 
goals so the religious bloc could probably muster a majority on a 
range of issues 
the government can block any bills in the less powerful but 
royally appointed senate but it will have to compromise and work 
with the brotherhood if it hopes to pass its own legislation in the 
lower house 
leading brotherhood figures stress their pragmatism and 
allegiance to king hussein who remains the center of power they 
deny any plan to whip up an iranianstyle revolution 
as we worked with the monarchy while we were outside the 
parliament we will work with it from inside said hammam saeed 
who easily outpolled 50 other candidates in ammans 5th district 
our method is to use dialogue and persuasion and we have 
never forced anybody to accept our policies added saeed 45 a 
koranic teacher who studied postgraduate theology at temple 
university in pennsylvania 
saeed said saudi arabias strict islamic laws will be a guide 
to our new system but that it might take long years to 
implement islamic sharia law based on the koran islams holy book 
the fundamentalists triumphed despite hostility from 
governmentowned newspapers and husseins call for voters not to 
mix religion and politics 
islamic activists indicated they would target westernstyle 
culture in husseins kingdom where teenage girls dress in chic 
fashions and listen to rock music and where businessmen in european 
suits can drink whiskey at sidewalk cafes 
alcohol is prohibited in islam because it is harmful to health 
and a waste of money said abdulmunim abu zant who easily 
defeated nonbrotherhood rivals in ammans 2nd district 
well try to ban it in jordan he said but he added that if 
most deputies voted against them then we would wash our hands 
of the issue 
abu zant 52 also said the brotherhood would seek to require 
women to wear veils or scarves to limit the ferocity of 
adornment practiced by some women 
this appeared to be a less rigid observance than the strict 
islamic codes imposed by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 
iran which is overwhelmingly shiite moslem 
jordans fundamentalists who belong to the mainstream sunni 
sect have in the past often allied themselves with hussein a 
descendant of the prophet mohammed who founded islam in the 7th 
century 
the organizations platform calls for banning evil imports 
such as alcohol cigarettes makeup and similar unnecessary 
commodities 
it also called for expanding health insurance building more 
hospitals improving teacher training and better care for the 
elderly 
the brotherhood said it would try to ban payment of interest 
seen as contrary to the koran and cancel jordans debt 
rescheduling agreements with foreign lenders an action hussein has 
ruled out 
with the budget in their hands lawmakers may have more 
influence over the government television station which broadcasts 
many american and european programs the islamists consider sinful 
saeed cited the example of the us comedy show threes 
company which revolves around two women and a man who live in 
the same house he called it contrary to islamic ideology 
no man can live under one roof with two women in this society 
without marriage he complained this is ridiculous these 
films decay the human mind 
the brotherhoods platform and campaign literature also demanded 
arabs liberate the land of palestine from the jordan river to 
the sea 
but parliament isnt likely to have any say on foreign policy 
which has been dominated by husseins efforts to win arab 
acceptance of israels existence and israeli acceptance of 
palestinian rights

visiting the soviet union and its crewmen recalled forming close 
ties with one sailor saying they were brothers a brotherhood of 
the sea

the soviet black sea fleet and the ship bore a banner combining 
the soviet and us flags 
it was incredible terrific ensign steven hersch said of 
the crews stop at the city of sevastopol the first visit by a 
us navy ship to a soviet port in 14 years there must have been 
50000 people standing on the pier people were throwing gifts to 
us money food clothes 
i would liken it to the old war movies said hersch there 
were people as far as the eye could see 
the kauffman escorted by the cruiser thomas s gates visited 
the black sea port aug 4 to 8 as part of an exchange between the 
soviet and us navies that also brought soviet ships to norfolk 
va 
i dont really know how to say it it was almost like we were 
brothers a brotherhood of the sea said petty officer michael 
krick they asked us how much money we made they asked me about 
my house 
cmdr richard c bogle said the kauffman approached sevastopol 
in stormy weather 
but as we came to the entrance the sun borke through the 
clouds and lit up the water he said it was almost as if the 
way into sevastopol was being guided 
the kauffmans crew was allowed to visit the city and meet with 
their soviet counterparts the kauffman was also given a sister 
ship the cruiser azov 
lt cmdr george graveson said the sailors were mobbed by people 
wanting to meet an american and learn more about the united states

when a 3yearold boy released a batch of 
balloons with selfaddressed envelopes on them he never expected 
to the kind of response he got an angry letter from the electric 
company 
the anderson municipal light amp power co wrote joseph d 
mckinney on thursday to admonish the tot after a couple of his 
heliumfilled ballooons shorted out a 7620volt power line 
twentyfive homes lost power for about half an hour because of 
the balloons set free on joesphs birthday which were attached to 
a note and a return envelope with josephs address on it 
the electric companys line supervisor robert j sokol mailed 
the sternly worded letter to joseph on thursday describing where 
the balloons landed and how they affected the companys customers 
i know this was a freak accident that did not cause any real 
damage but when you get a little older you should be aware of 
how dangerous power lines can be the letter stated 
helped out by his father joseph had set eight silvery metallic 
helium balloons off on nov 3 from his home on indianapolis far 
east side 
three days later and about 30 miles to the north two of the 
balloons one with a mickey mouse picture and the other saying i 
love you became entangled in electrical lines and caused the 
power loss 
who thinks of balloons getting tangled up in anything said 
the boys father mark e mckinney 28 i could see it if it was 
a kite not a balloon because usually balloons go straight up and 
you just dont think about it 
sokol let up a bit on the stern tone when he wrapped up the 
letter to joseph 
in closing he wrote i want to wish you a happy third 
birthday

almost one year from the day gov michael s 
dukakis lost the presidential election his wife was hospitalized 
after drinking rubbing alcohol and his mother for fainting spells 
and the state posted an additional 220 million in debt 
just 15 months before dukakis stood before a cheering 
convention hall in atlanta and accepted the democratic nomination 
basking in the glow of his image as the american immigrant dream 
few american political figures have fallen so far so fast 
without the taint of scandal to hasten their demise say historians 
and political analysts 
part of it is hes not a sympathetic figure said larry 
sabato a professor of government at the university of virginia 
i feel sympathy for him now because of his wife but people really 
dont feel for him its part of the coldness in him 
when you like a politician youre willing to forgive 
transgressions dukakis had a lot of political capital to draw on 
but no emotional capital 
now things are so bad that even massachusetts republicans 
relentless in their attacks on dukakis since his election loss 
have expressed some sympathy 
across the board theres a feeling thats it like a 
shakespearean tragedy said alexander tennant executive director 
of the state republican party they look whats happened to his 
personal and political life and its clear that its falling 
apart 
dukakis political downfall began almost immediately after the 
election in part because of a downturn in computer and other 
hightech industries the economic boom he called the 
massachusetts miracle had evaporated like a mirage by nov 9 
1988 when dukakis reported back to work at the statehouse the 
state is facing a budget deficit of at least 720 million in the 
past 18 months dukakis and some democrat legislative leaders have 
enacted or proposed about 2 billion in taxes to plug the gap 
since state law requires a balanced budget 
dukakis was roundly denounced for neglecting his duties at home 
in favor of the presidential race 
he was a false frontrunner and when he dropped he went into 
free fall said john mclaughlin a conservative political 
commentator and host of the syndicated public affairs show the 
mclaughlin group 
but falling from the kind of lead he has is probably unmatched 
by anyone it strikes a lot of people as odd that he seems to be 
oblivious to his own low political level most people know when the 
game is over but michael dukakis continues to strut as if hes 
someone very much in line as a future national candidate 
mclaughlin said 
a historian who is harsly critical of former president reagan 
suggested that many of dukakis troubles stem simply from his lack 
of charisma 
i guess people had high hopes for him but it all had to do 
with the happenstance of politics and public affairs said henry 
steele commager after all hes done nothing wrong republicans 
in power have an unbroken record of chicanery and corruption 
reagans regime was one of the most unfortunate and dishonest weve 
ever had but since he was a popular moving picture actor he 
profited from the lack of critical acumen that has come over the 
american people 
dukakis misfortunes reached closer to home last week on the 
eve of his his loss to george bush one year ago he returned home 
monday night to find his wife kitty asleep when he woke her to 
tell her she had a phone call she complained of feeling groggy and 
sick she was rushed by ambulance to the hospital for what was 
later revealed to be a severe reaction to drinking rubbing alcohol 
mrs dukakis admitted to a 26year addiction to amphetamines 
during the presidential campaign she was treated for alcoholism at 
a facility in newport ri earlier this year a problem her 
family blamed in part to the stress of the election 
the same day kitty dukakis was taken to intensive care 
86yearold euterpe dukakis was hospitalized for recurring fainting 
spells and later was fitted with a pacemaker she and her 
daughterinlaw remained in separate hospitals saturday 
euterpe dukakis was tentatively scheduled for release sunday 
according to dukakis press secretary mindy lubber lubber could not 
say saturday when kitty dukakis would be released 
dukakis who announced jan 3 that he will not seek a fourth 
term has deflected resignation rumors by stressing the work that 
needs to be completed during his remaining 14 months in office

a score of top communist party and government 
officials in the central asian republic of uzbekistan have been 
charged with corruption after an investigation by soviet officials 
tass said saturday 
among those charged was the republics former communist leader 
inamzhon usmankhodzhayev who a year ago was expelled from the 
national partys central committee 
usmankhodzhayev and three other officials had been accused by 
the weekly magazine ogonyok of accepting bribes 
tass identified 20 officials from the republics national and 
regional party organizations and local government who had been 
charged 
an investigation revealed that they accepted large sums of 
money from their subordinates and other officials for patronage 
promotion at work and assistance in solving economic and other 
problems it said 
one regional party official in the neighboring republic of 
kazakhstan also was charged and several more investigations were 
continuing tass said 
an investigation of corruption in uzbekistan was launched 
shortly after the death of soviet president leonid i brezhnev in 
1982 
the probe eventually led to brezhnevs soninlaw yuri d 
churbanov who was found guilty of corruption in december and 
sentenced to 12 years in a labor camp 
two criminal investigators who spearheaded the probe into 
uzbekistan corruption telman gdlyan and nikolai ivanov parlayed 
their crusade into political success both won seats in the 
congress of peoples deputies parliament this year 
but the two prosecutors themselves are being investigated after 
allegations arose that they forced confessions from some suspects 
and ivanov publicly accused national politburo member yegor k 
ligachev of accepting bribes 
ligachev has denied the allegation and the procurators office 
says it has found no evidence to corroborate it 
gdlyan and ivanov have been taken off the uzbekistan case

east german leader egon krenz ruled 
out any idea of reunification in a telephone call saturday with 
chancellor helmut kohl a day after communist authorities began 
punching holes in the berlin wall 
kohl announced he will meet soon with the new east german 
leader and he offered financial aid if east germany follows 
through with promises of free elections and other reforms 
kohl convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the 
developments in east germany where krenzs 3weekold government 
opened the nations borders for the first time in 28 years thursday 
and began cutting additional transit points through the berlin wall 
on friday 
kohl later flew back to warsaw resuming a visit to poland that 
was interrupted for 27 hours to deal with the dramatic events back 
home 
as uncertainty grows over east germanys future there has been 
more speculation that reunification is a realistic possibility 
krenz ruled out that possibility 
it is important that we serve people and not discuss things 
that are not open to debate krenz said in an interview on the 
east german television news program aktuelle kamera after his 
conversation with kohl 
krenz said that in their telephone conversation kohl referred 
to the passage in west germanys founding basic law that calls 
for german reunification 
but krenz said any suggestion of discussing reunification was 
totally out of the question saying west german basic law is his 
kohls concern 
it is my concern to stress that there are two totally 
sovereign german states that must get along i will completely work 
for this but always in the interests of the citizens of east 
germany krenz said 
the chancellor did not say who called whom and government press 
officials told the associated press they did not know east 
germanys official news agency adn also did not say who placed 
the call 
speaking to reporters kohl said both german nations stand 
before a massive test because of historic changes in the 
communist land he said he will meet with krenz either late this 
month or in early december to discuss the changes under way in east 
germany 
kohl said his meeting with krenz would not be in east berlin 
but somewhere else he did not disclose west germany does not 
recognize east berlin as the capital of the communist state 
kohl said his chief of staff rudolf seiters will travel to 
east berlin on nov 21 to talk with east german officials about 
possible financial support but at the same time he called on east 
germany to institute reforms including free elections and a 
freemarket economy 
the federal government calls on the state and party leadership 
in east germany to finally open the gate for a fundamental change 
in state economy and society kohl said 
the west german government already provides substantial aid to 
the east german state through generous funds for maintenance of the 
highways connecting berlin with west germany and through trade 
deals that provide the communist state with the bulk of its 
hardcurrency earnings 
west german payments are estimated to be at least 550 million 
per year 
kohl also said he is in constant contact with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev about the situation in east germany 
and with president bush and the leaders of britain and france as 
well 
the united states britain and france formally supervise west 
berlin under postworld war ii agreements 
the chancellor faces potentially enormous problems because of a 
steady exodus of east germans straining west germanys already 
burdened social welfare system more than 200000 east germans have 
fled to west germany this year

the soviet union and most of its allies 
on saturday hailed east germanys decision to open the berlin wall 
but cautioned that the cold war relic will still be considered a 
border between the germanys 
official media in czechoslovakia the soviet union and hungary 
carried reports about east berlins decision to open its borders 
romania which has the most repressive leadership in the bloc has 
kept a virtual news blackout on the event 
the wall has ceased to be an obstacle to free movement 
but it doesnt mean that it stopped to be a border as well the 
borders existence continues as well as the border between the two 
german states the czech youth daily mlada fronta said in an 
editorial 
the fossil from the cold war years the symbol of division of 
europe along which many people have died has fallen to let our 
continent the people of the east and west learn to live together 
after years of silent neighborhood the newspaper said 
the response was similar in the soviet union which under 
president mikhail s gorbachev has embarked on a broad program of 
social and political reforms that have spread to other communist 
nations 
the communist party daily pravda said the decision of the east 
german government is a brave and wise political step attesting to 
a complete break with old dogmas 
a komsomolskaya pravda article titled a person walks through 
the wall described the euphoria among germans on both sides but 
emphasized concerns about what the economic and social effects of 
the changes will be 
the white house said saturday that gorbachev sent president bush 
a message signaling his support for the east german changes and 
expressing hope the situation will remain calm and peaceful 
in hungary where the communist party itself has been banished 
to history books since it disbanded last month an editorial in the 
daily nepszava said as far its function is concerned the wall 
has already collapsed 
the purpose of the berlin wall as opposed to its chinese 
counterpart was not to keep invaders out but to keep people who 
wanted to leave inside 
the daily magyar hirlap wrote in an editorial that the east 
german leadership has sought to make up for the errors in the 
past decades in just four weeks 
now that the wall has lost its function the process of 
european rapprochement may be accelerated 
another hungarian daily magyar nemzet said in an editorial 
that it is likely that east german leader egon krenz intended 
this move as a safety valve rather than as a step toward german 
unity 
now that berlin is no longer a strong antiperestroika 
bastion it will mean serious pressure on czechoslovakia the 
newpaper said 
czechoslovakias communist leadership has resisted the sort of 
farreaching political and social reforms under way in hungary and 
poland police used truncheons on oct 28 to break up a 
demonstration by thousands of people and hundreds were arrested 
in communist nonaligned yugoslavia the state tanjug news agency 
said east germanys decision was a positive step toward removal 
of bloc barriers in europe which creates room for a change of 
the postwar geopolitical picture of the european continent 
an official in the government press office krzysztof bakalarski 
told the associated press on saturday that a formal statement of 
the polish government on the situation in east germany was expected 
monday when the cabinet meets generally we are satisfied 
bakalarski said 
poland this year installed the first east bloc government not 
led by communists

liselotte schlesinger was glad 
she could leave east germany to buy coffee chocolate and soap but 
the thrill of crossing the longforbidden passage west was what 
really attracted her 
at first i didnt believe it would be like this she said as 
she waited in a long line of cars headed back to east germany 
thats why i had to come this morning 
east germans in huge numbers jammed border crossings and towns 
saturday as they swarmed into west germany shopped for goods 
scarce at home or just took a curious look around 
west german border police at herleshausen 70 miles northeast of 
frankfurt said nearly 60000 east germans had crossed in just 24 
hours and people had to wait up to seven hours in a line 
stretching back 40 miles 
many waited in lines once they got out of their cars too about 
50 people stood outside a little grocery store an appliance store 
owner reported doing three times his normal business and about 100 
people milled around on the street to buy beer discounted 
halfprice for east germans 
townspeople talked about the bride from schnellmannshausen 
still in her wedding dress who drove across with her husband in a 
flowergarlanded car and said she just wanted to see what her 
village looked like from the western side of the border 
in frankfurt 21yearold mechanic frank hoberg marveled over 
all the fruit he found in the west 
they have fruits here that ive never seen before in my 
life said hoberg who was packing a shopping bag with kiwi 
pineapples and bananas 
ive had pineapples before but only from the can id never 
seen a kiwi either 
most travelers told west german border police they were only 
crossing into the west for a weekend visit as a result of the new 
travel freedoms granted by the communist east berlin government 
police at herleshausen were not even checking passports of the 
visitors waving them through and offering directions into town 
where each could pick up 55 in welcome money at banks or 
municipal offices 
elsewhere the rush of visitors bordered on chaos in the 
northern bavarian city of hof near the east german border 
officials barred further traffic from entering downtown because of 
the deluge of east germans 
in bonn the interior ministry said 140000 east germans arrived 
overnight in west germany so many people entered west berlin that 
officials quit counting them 
west german border police said east german cars were backed up 
for about 24 miles at the crossing near helmstedt west germany 
and there were huge lines at other crossing points as well 
east german cars swamped parking lots in the northern west 
german city of hamburg while wartburgs and trabants filled with 
happy east germans clogged west german streets and highways 
outside herleshausen west germans waved smiled and gave 
vforvictory signs to the visitors as they drove through 
an electrician from eisensach just across the border in east 
germany said he piled his wife and two sons into their trabant for 
a day trip as soon as i heard it was possible in the beginning i 
didnt understand i thought it was only for people who wanted to 
come forever 
but in an indication that everything has not changed overnight 
the electrician asked that he not be cited by name 
were still not used to this freedom he said im still 
afraid of some disadvantage we still dont believe that this is a 
reality

two new jersey scholars who predict the 
great plains will revert back to the days when it was only a home 
where the buffalo roam got some discouraging words from the human 
herd that lives there now 
but frank popper and deborah epstein popper say the heated 
reaction they got from the areas residents friday one called 
their work popperscock is tinged with a fear that the theory 
that much of the plains is emptying out is prophetic 
a region that was totally sure of itself genuinely secure in 
its own future would not have made so much of this said popper 
a rutgers university urban studies professor 
the pair faced some hostile questions from about 125 north 
dakota journalists and others at the university of north dakota 
editors and broadcasters day 
popper and his wife a doctoral student in geography at rutgers 
suggest the federal government should eventually buy up most of the 
plains to create a huge buffalo commons 
this is a theory and you have to ask ok we understand what 
youre saying but what the hell do you want us to do about it 
leave said mark carlson editor of the weekly pierce county 
tribune 
gov george sinner didnt attend the forum but he said thursday 
that he believes the buffalo commons idea is a passing thing 
and that the poppers did not appreciate the importance of the 
region 
a vast majority of the worlds food supply comes from these 
plains states sinner said and i think they think the food 
comes from the supermarket down the road and the electricity comes 
from the switch on the wall 
the notion that someone from new jersey couldnt appreciate the 
plains was expressed by some in the audience too 
i hope they enjoy it back home in toxic jersey said lauren 
donovan editor of the weekly hazen star foolishness and 
popperscock like this could only have come from a place like that 
but ellen swendsen of hettinger in western north dakota said 
the couples views were not unrealistic 
i walk around and count the empty houses and i shudder she 
said i think that what the man said made a lot of sense 
we need to be thinking critically added bismarck tribune 
reporter jeff olson i think the challenge has been laid square 
in our lap and i think we all realize that 
the poppers idea first outlined in a december 1987 magazine 
article envisions a 55million acre buffalo commons including 
large parts of north and south dakota montana wyoming nebraska 
kansas colorado new mexico oklahoma and texas 
the commons would come about as plains residents gradually 
abandon a relatively arid region that has never been thickly 
settled despite extensive federal inducements and subsidies 
the couple said the 1862 homestead act which gave 160 acres to 
anyone willing to settle the land and stay five years was a 
historic error 
federal encouragement of settlement on the plains they wrote 
was the largest longestrunning agricultural and environmental 
miscalculation in american history 
cities like bismarck lubbock texas and cheyenne wyo would 
be left to the roles of urban islands in a shortgrass sea as 
onefifth of americas land area gradually becomes the worlds 
largest historic preservation project the ultimate national 
park frank popper said 
the poppers are developing maps of each of the states within the 
commons to buttress their arguments that the region is in longterm 
decline their north dakota maps document 16 counties with 
significant poverty population losses and little building activity 
the counties which have a combined population between 60000 
and 70000 run a high risk of becoming part of this buffalo 
commons popper said 
popper acknowledges if the counties lose all their residents it 
would involve a great deal of individual suffering and community 
hardship 
but he said he does not believe the commons area will lose its 
entire population nor does he advocate aggressive federal 
intervention in creating the preserve 
we never advocated any kind of rural version of some horrible 
urbanrenewal project he said 
if somehow our work gets the plains so irritated at us that 
the region is inspired to pull up its socks just to prove what 
waterheads we are wed be delighted we really would

rainer himpel had his family up at 3 am for the 
long drive to and through the berlin wall buoyed by visions of 
shopping bags bulging with treats unavailable at home 
as the sun set over berlin on saturday himpel hadnt spent a 
pfennig the wall was open all day but stores in west germany 
close for the weekend at 2 pm saturday by law the law was 
suspended in some parts of west germany because of the special 
circumstances but not in downtown west berlin 
although they could not shop the family returned home with 
souvenir memories a kiss from a drunk a uturn with a befuddled 
old woman in a crowded volkswagen van and a feeling of bewilderment 
in a strange land the other half of their own germanys capital 
city 
they also had all 400 marks 220 the family collected from the 
west german government which offers 100 marks to each new arrival 
from east germany 
it could have been a lot better himpel said disdaining the 
trinkets available in a street market well come back now we 
have the opportunity 
the family had driven 4 hours from their home in siebenlehn a 
town of 1200 where himpel and his wife monika run an auto body 
shop 
they specialize in fixing trabants the gimcrack east german 
cars abandoned by the thousands of east germans who moved west in 
the weeks before the wall was opened a trabbi usually rusts 
before its dented himpel said 
it took 90 minutes to get into west berlin from the eastern 
sector then there was a threehour wait at the bank fuer handel 
und industrie for the welcome money 
while himpel stood in line 11yearold tanja and lars 12 
checked out the ratzekatz toy shop marking it as stop no 1 on the 
shopping spree 
with the marks in hand however the family found a long line 
outside the toy shop just like home mrs himpel a cheerful 
woman said with a shrug 
they went along to the hertie department store it was closed 
lars looked thunderstruck 
the sun now hugged the horizon on a crisp autumn day that was 
turning cold they tried the subway but police were directing 
people away because it was too crowded they waited for a bus in 
vain taxis rolled by but all were taken 
at another bus stop the himpels got lucky with a volkswagen 
van albrecht gramberg the owner waved them into the back along 
with two other east germans and an elderly woman with a cane who 
had to be coaxed aboard 
three more people filled the front seat and gramberg laughed 
loudly as two more hitchhikers tried to flag him down 
i get the impression that everyone in berlin is stoned he 
said its like woodstock love peace and happiness because 
all signs and symbols of power are done 
in another month it has to be more serious he added in 
english but for now its a lot of fun 
a woman in the back spending her second day in the west without 
having gotten into a store said it also was very frustrating 
hardly the best place for a lady with a cane she observed to the 
elderly woman who replied i live here where back by the bus 
stop gramberg made a uturn 
by 430 hunger had led them to a tavern for bratwurst all 
around 
no more bratwurst the waitress said 
just like home mrs himpel said 
a small darkhaired woman lurched to the table brimming with 
beer and good will 
youre just like us just like us she said and planted a 
big smack on mrs himpels cheek while tanja made faces behind her 
shes not a regular the waitress explained but today 
nothing is normal

virginia sen john warner led thousands of 
people at the vietnam veterans memorial saturday in a solemn 
tribute to the 58175 americans whose names are inscribed on its 
black granite and a spontaneous celebration of another wall 
crumbling in berlin 
this memorial is one of incalculable majesty and mystique 
said warner in a veterans day ceremony marking the recent addition 
of 19 names to the dark mirror of americas vietnam toll it 
conveys the message that victory is ours not the traditional 
military victory but a nation approaching victory with itself 
a nation healing 
the gathering of more than 6500 people including families of 
those whose names were newly inscribed greeted with a booming 
cheer warners observation that there is another wall and that 
wall as we speak is crumbling down it falls because its 
foundation of communist suppression is being exposed to truth and 
to democracy 
but warner cautioned that despite the dramatic openings between 
east and west we cannot let our euphoria erode our will to 
provide america with the defense that we need 
we must remind ourselves that soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev has not become a pacifist he said the soviet union 
still maintains the largest army in the world and its navy 
continues to grow it remains a potent military threat to the 
security of the united states 
the ceremony beneath sparkling sunshine was moderated by jan 
c scruggs the vietnam war veteran who led the long and difficult 
fight to build the memorial since visited by millions of americans 
who daily leave wreaths love letters ribbons and medals 
countless flags and other remembrances on the sidewalk beneath the 
names 
in one way or another we are all related to the names on tat

a proposed rescue in space program that would include laws and 
facilities to aid spaceships in distress 
space for earth is the theme of the groups fifth planetary 
congress and is the title of an address to be delivered by indias 
dr yash pal this years winner of the associations award for his 
work in designing a satellite network to serve rural areas 
schweickart and soviet maj gen alexei leonov cochairmen of 
the association expressed hope their governments will eventually 
agree to send a joint team to mars schweickart an apollo 9 
astronaut said the association has submitted a recommendation to 
the us congress to accept the principle of such a voyage 
its much easier and far less costly for us to fly 
together to mars leonov told a news conference we fervently 
hope we will do it jointly 
leonov the first man to walk in space also underscored the 
importance of biomedical studies in space and experimenting with 
plant cultivation on mars

employing space technology for the good of mankind and leonov 
stressed that we congress members are against wars of all 
kinds be them on earth or in space war is the ugliest affliction 
to which mankind can be subjected 
soviet cosmonauts apparently aware of being hosted by the 
guardians of the islamic faith guardedly shirked atheism and 
conceded that god exists leonov lauded soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev for reinstating religion to its rightful place in the 
soviet society 
indeed this is one of gorbachevs wisest decisions he 
said we know that karl marx had said that religion is the opium 
of peoples what a blissful opium 
the saudis have mobilized a fleet of military jets to fly the 
guest spacemen to deliver lectures at universities military 
academies and technical institutes along the vast kingdom on

george saadeh a leading christian 
parliamentarian and head of the rightwing phalange party on 
saturday defended a peace accord forged last month with moslem 
legislators and opposed by hardline christian leader gen michel 
aoun 
his remarks underscored a split in christian ranks that widened 
after the accord was ratified and after christian rene mouawad was 
elected president mouawad was elected in a special parliament 
session that convened last week over aouns objections 
saudi arabias king fahd who brokered the accord drafted last 
month in taif saudi arabia said he was confident lebanon was 
moving toward peace after 14 years of civil war 
saadeh spoke from his home village of shibtine on the northern 
edge of the christian heartland in an interview broadcast by his 
partys radio station voice of lebanon 
christian officials have admitted privately that no christian 
politician based in east beirut would join mouawads proposed 
national reconciliation government before a settlement with aoun is 
achieved 
responding to aouns accusations that the parliamentarians were 
traitors for agreeing to an accord that does not include a 
deadline for withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon saadeh said 
what we worked out was a major achievement safeguarding lebanons 
unity 
the agreement gives the syrians two years to withdraw from the 
beirut area toward the eastern bekaa valley it states that their 
mission and stay there will be defined by the lebanese and syrian 
governments saadeh said 
but aoun whose troops fought the syrians for six months this 
year before a september ceasefire also wants a deadline for their 
evacuation from the bekaa as well 
the syrians are in lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping

would cope if they met resistance from the more than 12000 
usbacked contras living in honduras

there will be no exceptions avila said

unwillingness to disarm could not be reached for immediate comment

prime minister yitzhak shamir said saturday 
praised the events in east germany and other soviet bloc countries 
as popular revolutions but he cautioned that potential dangers 
exist 
what is happening today in eastern europe is an earthquake an 
enormous revolution that comes from within the people he said in 
an interview with israel radio 
i also think these changes raise various problems to which the 
international community has not provided a response yet he said 
for example the fate of germany of both germanys would there 
be some basis for the existence of both germanys would the 
european countries agree to a united germany 
shamir noted interesting processes in other countries of the 
soviet bloc where countries are instituting democratic and 
marketoriented reform but he said the changes might be dangerous 
since they have not reached stability yet it will apparently 
take time and that period of instability carries many dangers 
he also said reform under soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
largely depends on whether the soviet leaders would be able to 
control the forces they unleashed themselves so we are living in a 
really turbulent period 
shamir said he wished to see the middle east follow the example 
of democratic movements in the soviet bloc 
we should be sorry that all these positive changes have not 
reached the middle east in the middle east we dont see any moves 
for more democracy peace and reconciliation the only contribution 
we can see in this direction of advancing toward peace i have to 
say is our peace initiative shamir said 
the peace initiative adopted by the government in may calls 
for palestinian elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
to choose representatives for talks with israel on an interim 
period of selfrule

rose ficarellis concern with the chicago bears 
is not whether they win or lose but how badly they rip their 
uniforms 
mrs ficarelli still working full time at 96 mends the 
teams shirts and pants after every game 
oh they were terrible she said after sundays game against 
green bay all kinds of rips and tears especially in the 
shoulders when they fall down they seem to throw themselves onto 
one shoulder so you get this 
she held up tom thayers game jersey full of stitches and 
alterations 
look how beated up it is she said some of the guys are 
so superstitious theyll wear a shirt until it falls off 
mrs ficarelli works with an old singer sewing machine at the 
all american co athletic equipment reconditioning plant in 
suburban franklin park peering through black spectacles with jewel 
inlays she has been sewing team uniforms since 1938 and reparing 
bears jerseys since 1951 
by the end of the year i say sometimes that its just my 
stitching that holds them together she said 
even though mrs ficarelli is doubtless among the oldest 
fulltime workers in the united states her attendance record is 
better than anyones said her boss ray gluss weve 
practically got to chase her to get her out of here 
the company employs 30 and serves dozens of high school and 
college teams but mrs ficarelli takes primary responsibility for 
the bears jerseys 
when the plant was in chicago players used to drop by and mrs 
ficarelli would write inspirational notes and stuff them inside the 
jerseys 
id put take care dont get hurt i hope my prayers will be 
answered this week things like that she said 
but when the company moved to the suburbs personal contact 
ended and she stopped writing the notes on her recent birthday 
however she visited halas hall at the bears training camp 
this is me with richard dent she said pulling out a 
photograph of her talking to the defensive end from her black 
snapclose purse 
im telling him to stop tearing his shirt she said

been doing for years said another university of virginia 
professor michael cornfield

peruvians will risk their lives sunday to 
elect local leaders who may not survive their terms of office a 
grim test of the nations ability to survive a relentless terror 
campaign by leftist guerrillas 
the shining path rebel movement has mounted the heaviest 
offensive in its nineyear insurgency in an effort to disrupt 
sundays municipal balloting the rebels say the violence is the 
first stage in their strategy to block aprils presidential 
election 
more than 130 mayors local judges clerks councilmen and 
municipal candidates have been slain this year and hundreds more 
have resigned in fear 
last month was dubbed red october by the lima press after 
330 people were killed in fighting and political violence 
authorities have admitted the government cannot provide 
protection to the 4000plus mayoral candidates and are worried a 
high percentage of voters may avoid the polls 
if the shining path achieves its objective of preventing voting 
in a large part of the national territory it will signify a clear 
victory for terror said a high government official who spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
about 10 million people have registered to vote 
the national election board says there are no candidates in 86 
of perus nearly 2000 municipalities mostly in rural areas but 
independent political analysts say the figure is closer to 200 
the guerrillas have concentrated their campaign of terror in 
villages and small towns but even in lima home to onethird of 
perus population of 21 million people are fearful of attacks on 
election day 
im not going to vote no way they say the terrorists are 
going to cut off the fingers of people who vote said antonieta 
de baron a 36yearold homemaker 
voters must dip their index fingers into purple ink that does 
not wear off for at least a week in the last presidential election 
in 1985 shining path rebels cut off the fingers of voters in 
several highland villages 
i would rather pay the fine and put up with the problems 
said mrs de baron 
voting is required by law violators face a fine and cannot 
apply for passports drivers licenses and other legal documents if 
their voting cards are not stamped 
bus passengers traveling the carretera central which connects 
lima with the central andes say rebels have confiscated their 
voter registration cards at roadblocks 
the carretera central leads to junin department in perus 
mining and farming heartland the shining path has called for a 
threeday armed strike there and in the neighboring departments 
of pasco and huanuco beginning sunday 
in may in a demonstration of the shining paths growing 
strength about 1 million people in the three departments obeyed 
the groups demand to halt work for three days cutting all 
supplies of food electric power and mineral exports to lima on the 
pacific coast 
on saturday the bodies of a high school girl and four other 
people were found near ayacucho police reported they said all had 
been tortured and shot in the head 
police said they did not know the killers and no group claimed 
responsibility 
the wave of violence in recent weeks has shifted the focus from 
the candidates and their issues to the ability of the guerrillas to 
disrupt the voting 
the municipal elections have always been viewed as a testing 
ground for the political parties that participate in the general 
elections 
the principal parties contending in the municipal races are the 
united left a marxistled coalition and the democratic front a 
centerright coalition led by novelist mario vargas llosa who is 
favored to win the presidential race 
with peru suffering from 3000 percent annual inflation and 
economic chaos the governing populist aprista party is given 
little chance of winning many mayoral races 
limas mayoral race has always been considered a key barometer 
of political sympathies and this year a political independent 
television showman ricardo belmont is strongly favored to win 
belmont who owns a television station and is known for his 
charitable telethons and for promoting sporting events is 
promising action not words analysts say his message is an 
appeal to voters disenchantment with perus politicians and 
political parties 
his leading competitor in a field of nine candidates is the 
democratic fronts juan inchaustegui a former cabinet minister 
political leaders worry that the publics disenchantment with 
politics makes voters more susceptible to the shining paths 
campaign against the electoral process 
we cannot expect anything good to come from the elections on 
the contrary they are only a pretext to defend this rotten 
democracy said a shining path leaflet distributed in ayacucho 
the highland city where the rebels launched their insurgency in may 
1980

l douglas wilders apparent election as 
the nations first black elected governor cast him as a national 
figure though he insists he does not wish for such a role 
i have no intention personally to be involved in the national 
scene wilder said at his first news conference after tuesdays 
election a session that drew reporters from around the world 
wilder followed one tradition of newly elected virginia 
governors when he made a speech to a luncheon of top business 
executives in new york two days after the election but there was 
nothing traditional about the rest of his schedule as the 
democratic lieutenant governor met with top congressional leaders 
and appeared on nearly every national television news program 
wilder compiled a 6582vote lead over republican j marshall 
coleman in unofficial returns of the nearly 18 million votes cast 
coleman promised to seek a recount if the elections final results 
as certified nov 27 by the state board of elections show him 
losing by a half percent or less a 6582vote margin would fall 
below that halfpercent cutoff 
still political analysts are already talking about wilder as a 
potential vice presidential candidate and say he can take as 
prominent a role in national politics as he wants 
wilder is a national figure whether he wants to be one or 
not said robert holsworth associate professor of political 
science at virginia commonwealth university 
holsworth and other experts said wilder would have to 
concentrate on running the state well for a couple of years before 
looking beyond richmond 
in the long run however i dont think that he will 
necessarily refuse any advances from the national party 
holsworth said 
if wilders ambitions exceed the governors mansion he still 
could be hampered by his lack of experience outside the government 
of a mediumsized state he said 
its very possible that hell choose a more modest role for 
himself said stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings 
institution in washington on the other hand obviously because 
of his uniqueness he could have as large a role as he wishes 
its easy for a virginia governor to pursue a national role 
because of the states proximity to the media centers of new york 
and washington hess said 
national democrats are likely to tout wilder because he is a 
black moderate who contrasts with the more liberal jesse jackson 
analysts said 
wilder helps alleviate the problems democrats have especially 
in the south from being known as the black party because he is 
very acceptable to so many white voters said hastings wyman jr 
publisher of the southern political report 
because he is acceptable to so many white voters i think he 
becomes an automatic name on the list for vice president for 
democrats wyman said they cant put jackson on the ticket 
they might be able to put wilder on the ticket 
wilder is probably in a strong enough position for party 
officials to come to him and not look like hes hungry for more 
than he has right now said mark rozell an assistant professor of 
political science at mary washington college 
but wilder could face competition from other moderate black 
politicians such as rep william h gray iii a democrat from 
pennsylvania who is house majority whip and the mayors of several 
major cities observers said 
there are a lot of prominent black politicians out there right 
now observed michael barone editor of the almanac of american 
politics 
any national ambitions wilder might have could be sidetracked if 
sen charles s robb a former virginia governor runs for 
president 
youre not going to have two virginia democrats on a ticket 
hess said 
even if wilder remains mum about his ambitions hess said it 
would be easy to tell what his intentions are by watching his 
travel schedule if it takes him out of virginia often enough 
wilder may have bigger things on his mind

the coast guard refloated a 470foot tanker off the 
florida keys on saturday as officials assessed the damage to the 
areas fragile coral reef from the grounding the third in less 
than three weeks 
the greek ship elpis carrying a cargo of sugar and fuel oil 
became lodged in the key largo national marine sanctuary late 
friday about five miles east of key largo and 50 miles south of 
miami 
the accident happened about four miles south of where the 
155foot freighter alec owen maitland ran aground oct 25 cutting 
a 200foot swath in the reef in the sanctuary 
five days later the 475foot cargo ship mavro vetranic became 
lodged on a reef off the dry tortugas a small island group about 
60 miles west of key west the yugoslav ship carrying phosphate 
and fuel destroyed about 500 feet of reef 
both ships were refloated within days without leaking any fuel 
or other cargo 
the groundings occurred just weeks after gov bob martinez gave 
interior secretary manuel lujan a tour of the keys and the worlds 
thirdlargest living coral reef which stretches about 200 miles 
from miami to the dry tortugas 
officials were at a loss to explain the rash of accidents the 
first significant groundings in the area in five years 
coast guard petty officer jim wentworth said the waters through 
the marine sanctuary off key largo are not difficult to navigate 
you can see the change in color between the deep and shallow 
water and its well marked by buoys he said i dont know why 
these groundings are happening but they shouldnt be 
there were no reports of any leaks from the elpis which was 
pulled off the reef as the tide rose saturday afternoon wentworth 
said the ship was anchored in deeper water and likely would head 
to miami he said 
a special coast guard board of inquiry is expected to convene 
monday to investigate the incident and question crew members said 
captain herbert robinson commanding officer of the coast guard 
marine safety office in miami a similar panel is looking into the 
mavro vetranic accident 
the elpis crew has not been tested for drug or alcohol use 
wentworth said 
gov bob martinez also amended an executive order to permit a 
state criminal investigation of the first two groundings to be 
expanded to cover the elpis said brian ballard a spokesman for 
the governor 
in addition to the state investigations a 9 million federal 
civil lawsuit has been filed charging the yugoslav freighter mavro 
vetranic was unseaworthy and the crew incompetent 
officials still were assessing reef damage caused by the elpis 
but some experts and environmentalists say the damage from the 
three groundings may be irreparable 
university of miami oceanography professor peter glynn said 
there has been very little coral regrowth in the 128000 square 
feet of reef destroyed by the freighter wellwood in 1984 the worst 
grounding of the decade in the keys 
it looked like four or five tractors just put their blades 
down and plowed the reef bare he said its a sad sight 
deevon quirolo spokesman for the key westbased reef relief 
conservation group said the nutrientrich south florida water 
promotes growth of sea grass and algae in damaged reef areas which 
inhibit the growth of coral 
the reefs never really come back she said 
ms quirolo urged that international shipping lanes be moved 
further from the reef and crews of foreignregistered ships be 
checked more thoroughly 
three groundings in a row is devastating she said we are 
worried when a diver brushes a fin against the reef think about 
what happens when a freighter rams it

china on sunday accused the voice of america 
radio network of trying to stir up chaos in its report on a 
communist party meeting considering an economic austerity plan 
voa reported on the policymaking central committee meeting in 
a purely fictitious way the government news agency xinhua said 
it said voa reported that provincial party officials fiercely 
debated with central party leaders over financial matters and that 
economic measures adopted at the plenum aimed to return chinas 
economy to government control 
there was no fierce debate whatsoever this was a sheer 
fabrication by voa xinhua quoted an unidentified authoritative 
source as saying 
the source accused the us governmentrun radio station of 
attempting to stir up chaos for despicable means xinhua said 
a text of the chineselanguage voa broadcast was not immediately 
available 
china has repeatedly lashed out against voa for spreading 
rumors during the apriltojune protests for democratic reforms 
which ended in a military crackdown that left at least hundreds 
dead 
criticizing voa is one of the chinese governments ways of 
expressing displeasure with the us government which beijing 
accuses of involvement in the popular uprising 
two voa correspondents were expelled by china following the 
early june crackdown one accredited reporter remains in beijing 
the fourday party meeting ended with a communique calling for 
austere living over the next two years to combat inflation 
excessive growth and corruption 
it also outlined four general goals including cutting 
consumption tightening control over finances realigning the 
industrial structure and boosting production 
chinas move to improve the economic environment and rectify 
the economic order is aimed at deepening the ongoing reforms and 
promoting a sustained steady and coordinated development of 
chinas national economy xinhua said 
but the voa in its chineselanguage service distorted the 
contents of the communique xinhua quoted the official as saying 
this will surely arouse the indignation of the chinese people

a man who paid 19500 for a 1978 chrysler 
new yorker valued at 5000 didnt care about the car he forked 
over an extra 14000 for the honor of having delaware license 
plate number 313 
in delaware license plates can be privately sold creating a 
market where drivers are willing to pay premium prices for the 
lowest possible number to cover their cars rear 
four digit numbers which used to sell for about 900 have shot 
up in recent years to more than 2000 threedigit plates sell for 
as much as 25000 and the cream of the crop numbers below 100 
are so rare it is hard to determine a value 
jay hurley who has been buying and selling lownumbered license 
plates from his usedcar dealership in new castle county for more 
than 20 years estimates a twodigit number would be worth from 
35000 to 50000 
one number at least 100000 unbelievable right nobody 
unless theyre people who are familiar with tags believe they 
bring that kind of money hurley said 
hurley said prices for low numbers have tripled in the past year 
and ray savage who bought the chrysler new yorker said he already 
has received higher offers for the tag he recently bought 
i could sell it at a substantial profit but im not 
interested savage said 
the lowest privatelyheld number is no 4 owned by margaret 
peggy mcconnell of wilmington wife of the late jh tyler 
mcconnell who issued himself the plate in the 1940s when he 
headed the state highway department which oversees the division of 
motor vehicles 
i would never give it up its the one thing i know tyler 
never wanted me to sell he had the idea that four was a very lucky 
number for him she said 
the no 1 tag always goes to the current governor no 2 to the 
current lieutenant governor and no 3 to the current secretary of 
state 
delaware citizens can sell license plates privately because the 
motor vehicle division does not reissue plates license plates can 
be transferred from one vehicle to another provided the owner 
holds title to both vehicles 
in delaware the number goes with the car and it stays with 
the vehicle indefinitely were still honoring plates issued in the 
1940s said robert voshell head of the state division of motor 
vehicles 
it is now impossible to get any number below five digits 
voshell said

avtex fibers inc agreed saturday to 
remove a highly flammable chemical from its closed rayon plant 
while federal inspectors checked for other hazardous materials 
avtex officials met with federal state and local environmental 
and hazardous waste specialists at the plant which shut down 
abruptly friday after the state revoked its waste water discharge 
permit the state water control board found thursday that avtex had 
violated the permit by dumping toxic polychlorinated biphenyls or 
pcbs into the shenandoah river 
the plant hampered for years by costly pollution and worker 
safety problems last year was promised a 226 million federal 
bailout because it is the only supplier of carbonized rayon yarn 
used in the space shuttle and nuclear missiles 
us environmental protection agency and state officials who 
arrived late friday were most concerned about containers of carbon 
disulfide left in the plant said harold yates an epa spokesman 
yates said he believed the highly flammable chemical was in liquid 
form stored in containers at the bottom of water tanks 
the company agreed to arrange for the removal of the carbon 
disulfide within the next few days he said that basically 
will be determined by the availability of a contractor that can 
come in here and safely transfer that material to railroad tank 
cars 
yates said epa personnel were guarding the chemical until its 
removal which will be paid for by the company 
this was one of the chemicals that was generated or used in 
the manufacturing process there he said it presented a hazard 
once the plant shut down because employees were no longer there to 
keep an eye on it he said 
about a half dozen epa officials and several contractors were on 
the site checking for other hazardous materials yates said he 
said he believed the company would continue cleaning up the pcbs 
with epa oversight 
david a tousignant president of the front royal plant said 
thursday the company would be unable to clean up the site if it 
shut down and lost its revenues his home phone number is unlisted 
and he could not be reached for comment saturday 
the approximately 400 workers received no notice although 
federal law requires 60 days of notice when large plants shut down 
for foreseeable reasons said james brinklow business agent for 
the amalgamated clothing and textile workers union local at avtex 
were out of a job now brinklow said maintaining the state 
should pay the workers for 60 days because it forced the closure 
state officials sued to close the plant saying pcbs have 
contaminated it since a december 1985 leak of some 500 gallons of 
the toxins from a transformer 
richard n burton executive director of the state water board 
called the plants sudden closing an example of a continuing 
contempt for the public as well as virginias environment 
workers and residents said the states action left the company 
no choice 
theres a lot of talk whether this is more politics than 
substance said michael w kitts front royals vice mayor 
kitts said he supports the states efforts to stop the pollution 
but it was unfair to force the company to shut down when it had 
started cleaning up the pcbs earlier this year

to keep retailers in business while work was done on salvageable 
mall buildings and new ones were built a process that could take 
up to five years

six months said john hicks owner of the garage grill and

amnesty international based its 
criticism of malawis human rights record on false accounts of 
torture in prison the government said saturday 
an official statement issued in blantyre said an amnesty 
international report released tuesday in britain was based on 
information from disgruntled and misguided malawians 
the human rights organization based in london alleged that 
torture and other mistreatment of prisoners was sanctioned by 
president h kamuzu banda 
the amnesty report claimed the number of political detentions in 
this landlocked southern african nation increased during 1989 
no prisoner is tortured and to insinuate that torture in 
prison is sanctioned by the life president is ridiculous and 
absurd the government said such a statement can only be made 
by a madman or one who specializes in gathering rumours 
banda led the former british colony of nyasaland to independence 
as malawi in 1964 and now is president for life

the researchers who once reported that 
marriage prospects for collegeeducated women over 30 were dim have 
published a final draft of their study that steers clear of the 
constroversy of the first work 
the three researchers said the 1986 figures were misinterpreted 
and misused and that they did not want attention again diverted 
from the real focus of their study the divergence of marriage 
rates among blacks and whites 
it was discouraging for us as academic researchers to see the 
way in which the media used our figures essentially to assault 
women neil g bennett an associate professor of sociology at 
yale university said saturday 
women were in effect told by the headlines that they cant 
have it all they shouldnt have it all and that they should go 
back home leave their careers raise babies and clean house 
that was by no means our message bennett said 
in the earlier draft of their study the reseachers reported 
that collegeeducated white women had a 20 percent likelihood of 
marriage at the age of 30 a 5 percent chance at 35 and a 1 percent 
chance at 40 
the figures were questioned by some sociologists and 
demographers but not before a host of news stories cast the 
findings in ominous terms a newsweek cover story declared that a 
40yearold woman had a better chance of being killed by a 
terrorist than of getting married 
the final study to be published in this months issue of the 
american journal of sociology does project that 115 percent of 
white women with more than a high school education who were born in 
the early 1950s will never marry 
but bennett said the finding cannot be compared to any of the 
figures in the earlier draft because the two analyses dealt with 
women of differing ages and educational background and because 
different sets of data were used 
the earlier study looked at 1982 census data from 70000 
households while the final draft is based on data from the 1985 
survey the stastistical model was also changed slightly bennett 
said 
bennett columbia university economist david e bloom and yale 
doctoral candidate patricia craig decided that to include a 
reassessment of the old figures would result in the real message of 
their study being lost bennett said 
it is very obvious from the reaction several years ago large 
numbers of people are interested in these kinds of figures but at 
this point we feel we have some very important issues to discuss 
and they are the underlying factors giving rise to the 
declining marriage rates of black women he said 
in their final study the authors seek to document the reasons 
why black and white marriage rates which have long differed have 
diverged dramatically and rapidly with time bennett said 
for black women born in the late 1930s the researchers said 
they would expect 115 percent to never marry but for black women 
born in the early 1950s they said they would expect 25 percent to 
never marry 
about 5 percent of white women born in the late 1930s will never 
marry while the figure rises to only 9 perent for white women born 
in the early 1950s according to the study

polish solidarity leader lech walesa comes to 
the united states holding his head high and his hand out accepting 
praise for forging the first noncommunist government in the soviet 
bloc while seeking money for its survival 
we are building an america of the east but that requires 
billions of dollars from the west walesa said in an interview 
before leaving poland for his us visit scheduled to begin monday 
walesas trip will provide a chance for president bush and 
congress to endorse in words and dollars the changes that are 
sweeping the soviet bloc and most recently have engulfed east 
germany 
the stocky mustachioed electrician who rocketed to world fame 
in august 1980 by clambering over the gdansk shipyard wall and 
leading the strike that created solidarity can expect warm words 
and warmer hospitality from the white house ceremony where he 
receives the presidential medal of freedom on monday to his speech 
to members of the house and senate on wednesday 
nor is he likely to return to gdansk emptyhanded as congress 
and the bush administration hammer out a deal providing 555 
million to 989 million over three years to bolster the sweeping 
reforms enacted in poland and hungary 
during a stop saturday at niagra falls as part of a fourday 
trip to canada walesa was mobbed by about 100 people 
the charismatic leader said outside a meeting with niagara falls 
mayor bill smeaton that he doesnt want to run for political office 
in poland in one of his few public utterances walesa said in 
polish i prefer to be a small boss 
at a remembrance day ceremony in toronto walesa helped a polish 
war veteran lay a wreath the ceremony drew about 2000 people 
many of whom clutched red and white solidarity flags 
walesa is to meet monday with prime minister brian mulroney 
following that session walesa will fly to washington where during 
a fourday period he will meet with bush twice address an aflcio 
convention and become the first private foreign citizen in 175 year 
to address a joint meeting of congress 
the last foreigner without a government job to address congress 
was the marquis de lafayette who fought as a general in the 
american revolution and spoke to a joint meeting in 1824 said ray 
smock the house historian 
walesa also will travel to new york chicago philadelphia and 
caracas venezuela before flying home 
all the official hoopla may seem to be old hat for a man who won 
the nobel prize for peace in 1983 but walesa said on the eve of 
his visit he was worried about not having time to see all the 
americans who want to meet him 
i cannot thank americans enough because it is physically 
impossible walesa told the associated press in an interview last 
week in gdansk any trip to the states shorter than one month is 
no good 
uppermost in walesas mind was the survival of the soldarity 
government headed by his former adviser tadeusz mazowecki 
to bolster that government walesa said we need columbuses 
from the states to discover poland to clear the trail 
then there will be an influx of millionaires because there is 
business to be done there said walesa describing a poland in 
need of rebuilding from top to bottom 
us aid is forthcoming but it may not be as much as walesa 
would like house and senate negotiators a week ago completed work 
on a compromise to send 533 million in fiscal 1990 to poland and 
hungary including a 200 million us contribution to a 1 billion 
international aid fund to help stabilize the polish currency as 
well as money for a 45 million program to promote private 
enterprise in poland 
additionally a team from the international monetary fund was in 
poland last week reviewing the reform program proposed by 
solidarity high marks from imf could open the way for new credits 
as well as a rescheduling of polands 40 billion foreign debt 
bush has nothing new for walesa secretary of state james a 
baker iii told reporters last wednesday but will reiterate the 
support he expressed during a visit to poland last july 
bush has proposed a 450 million aid package to poland low 
enough to draw accusations of timidity from senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine 
the amount proposed by bush may not be enough baker 
acknowledged if not you have to take another look at it at that 
time but the debate is not about policy approach its only about 
the amount of money he said 
bush responded to critics at a news conference last tuesday 
saying id like to hear some specific suggestions other than 
triple the spending on every initiative i dont hear complaints 
coming out of our allies or indeed out of hungary or poland or 
eastern europe 
he is not likely to hear public complaints from walesa either 
predicted janusz bugajski an analyst at the center for strategic 
and international studies in washington 
poles understand that america is not going to write them a 
blank check said bugajski but they want the psychological 
boost of having an american president say he suports them

craig spence a highprofile lobbyist linked to a 
washington sex scandal under federal investigation was found dead 
after barricading himself in a hotel room police said saturday 
spence 49 was found dead friday in his room at the 
ritzcarlton hotel after firefighters used a saw to cut the door in 
half 
spence had apparently barricaded the door with a bed he was 
found fully clothed and there were no visible signs of injuries 
suffolk county medical examiner leonard atkins said saturday an 
autopsy had been completed but the cause of death was still under 
investigation he said it could be weeks before his office issues a 
cause of death 
the washington times reported in august that spence disclosed he 
had aids and had threatened to commit suicide rather than die of 
the disease 
spence checked into the ritzcarlton on nov 4 under an alias 
according to patricia cutler the hotels director of public 
relations 
spence was identified this summer by the times as a major client 
of a homosexual escort service being investigated by the secret 
service the district of columbia police and the us attorneys 
office for possible credit card fraud other clients of the 
callboy ring included minor officials of the reagan and bush 
administrations the times said 
the newspaper said spence spent as much as 20000 a month on 
the escort service and quoted unidentified male prostitutes and 
others as saying spence had his house bugged 
judy smith a spokeswoman for us attorney jay stephens in 
washington said there would be no comment on spences death or its 
impact on the investigation 
spence faced new problems july 31 when he was arrested at a new 
york city motel on a felony weapons charge and misdemeanor 
possession of crack 
spence also has been linked to a white house guard who has said 
he accepted an expensive watch from spence and gave him a piece of 
presidential china the guard also reportedly allowed spence and 
some friends to take midnight tours of white house public areas 
last year 
the secret service has said the tours were unauthorized but not 
a security breach 
a former television news correspondent for abc who reported from 
vietnam spence later became a lobbyist representing japanese 
clients 
during the early years of the reagan administration in 
particular spence cultivated top political appointees leading 
academics military officials journalists and members of congress 
often entertaining them with starstudded parties 
the times said frequent party guests at his home included former 
cia director william casey conservative activist phyllis schlafly 
and james lilley ambassador to china and formerly to korea 
i had the world at my house and now they dont know who i 
am spence told the newspaper in an interview earlier this year 
according to records he filed under the foreign agents 
registration act spence received 110000 in a fivemonth period 
in 1981 from the policy study group of tokyo a nonprofit group 
financed by japanese business interests and affiliated with a 
faction of japans ruling liberal democratic party 
robert neumann who was once ambassador to saudi arabia and 
several other countries remembered spence on saturday as a nice 
somewhat erratic person 
spence once arranged for neumann and his wife to travel on an 
expensespaid trip to japan 
he invited me to a number of parties all of which were to 
enhance his business but that was normal neumann said he 
always behaved in an immaculate fashion personally i have only 
kind memories of him 
spence ceased working as a lobbyist for japanese interests in 
late 1987 documents show

thousands of people who falsified farmworker 
amnesty applications will get permanent resident status starting 
next month under the 1986 immigration law the new york times 
reported 
the program which offered farm workers a onetime amnesty was 
expected to accommodate 250000 but more than 13 million illegal 
aliens applied for legalization the times reported in sundays 
editions 
estimates by federal officials and immigration experts say there 
are between 250000 and 650000 fraudulent applications the times 
said 
the immigration and naturalization service has identified 
398000 cases of possible fraud but admits it hasnt enough 
manpower or money to prosecute individual applicants the times 
said 
the ins is to begin issuing permanent resident status to amnesty 
applicants dec 1 and officials said they were approving 94 
percent of the applicants over all 
supporters say the amnesty program has insured the nation a 
cheap reliable and legal supply of farm workers and has taken an 
important step toward legitimizing many of the nations illegal 
aliens 
but critics note cases like that of larry and sharon marval of 
newark nj who last year pleaded guilty to charges of 
immigration fraud after investigators alleged they were part of an 
operation that helped about 1000 aliens get amnesty with falsified 
documents showing they had all worked on just 30 acres of farmland 
the farm workers amnesty was a lastminute addition to the 
immigration reform and control act of 1986 which sought to halt 
illegal immigration it included a general amnesty offering a 
chance at permanent resident status to those illegal aliens who 
could prove they lived in the united states since before jan 1 
1982 and made it a crime to employ illegal aliens

the fbi is investigating the conduct of five 
senators who allegedly intervened in 1987 with regulators on behalf 
a nowdefunct savings and loan that was owned by a major political 
contributor according to a published report 
the washington post reported in its sunday editions that fbi 
agents last week extensively questioned edwin gray former head of 
the home loan bank board and other regulators about an april 2 
1987 meeting between gray and the senators 
the senators are dennis deconcini and john mccain of arizona 
alan cranston of california john glenn of ohio and donald w 
riegle jr of michigan mccain is a republican and the others are 
democrats 
fbi spokesman carlos hernandez said he could neither confirm nor 
deny the report cranston spokesman murray flander said he was 
unaware of an fbi investigation and agents had not contacted the 
senator glenn spokeswoman rebecca bell also said she had no 
knowledge of fbi activities 
there was no answer at the home phones of the spokesmen for the 
other senators 
gray testified last week before the house banking committee that 
at the april meeting in deconcinis office the senator made a 
request for him to ease regulation pressure on the lincoln savings 
and loan association by dropping a rule barring the thrifts risky 
investments 
gray said the other senators raised no objection whatsoever 
to deconcinis proposal 
the senators who received 13 million in campaign 
contributions from lincolns owner charles h keating 
acknowledged they were at the meeting but they disputed grays 
contention that they sought favorable treatment for the ailing 
thrift 
last april the government took control of lincoln after it was 
declared insolvent regulators estimate the thrifts failure will 
cost taxpayers 25 billion 
they the fbi agents seemed most interested in the 
senators one source told the post 
they seemed to have an extraordinary interest in what the 
senators were doing the source added 
the newspaper called the fbi decision to investigate unusual 
because it touches the gray ethical area of congressmens 
actions on behalf of contributors 
in addition to the fbi probe the senate ethics committee has 
asked the senators to explain their presence at two april meetings 
with gray 
common cause a political watchdog organization wrote a letter 
asking gerald e mcdowell chief of the public integrity section of 
the justice department to open an investigation into whether 
keating violated federal election or other laws in trying to 
influence the senators 
mcdowell acknowledged receiving the letter on oct 24 saying he 
would review the information and the circumstances under which 
five senators received corporate donations gifts andor campaign 
contributions from mr keating and his associates
