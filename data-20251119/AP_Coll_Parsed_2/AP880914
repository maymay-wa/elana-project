the us supreme court granted a 
temporary stay of execution wednesday night for a 28yearold 
murderer who was scheduled to die by injection for a fatal 
convenience story holdup that netted 24 
warren bridges execution scheduled for after 1 am edt 
thursday was stayed by the full court spokeswoman toni house said 
the court granted the temporary stay pending a timely filing of 
a request for a full review of the case by the court she said 
a federal district judge in galveston had refused to stay 
bridges execution for for the 1980 shooting of walter rose 62 in 
a convenience store robbery bridges lawyer then took his case to 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals 
bridge would have been the 102nd inmate executed nationally and 
the 28th in texas since the us supreme court ruling in 1976 
allowing states to resume the use of the death penalty 
galveston attorney anthony griffin contended in his appeal that 
during the punishment phase of bridges murder trial jurors were 
not allowed to consider mitigating circumstances or facts that 
might have led them to settle on a lesser punishment 
griffin cited arguments used in an appeal filed on behalf of 
texas death row inmate johnny penry whose case the us supreme 
court has agreed to hear 
after his arrest for the shooting bridge escaped briefly from 
the galveston county jail by knocking out a hole in the jail wall 
he was captured 19 hours later hitchhiking along a freeway 
rose was shot four times with a 38caliber pistol as bridge and 
his codefendant robert joseph costa robbed the convenience store 
of 24 on feb 10 1980 rose died of his wounds on feb 24 1980 
four days after bridge and costa were arrested 
costa was convicted of aggravated robbery and sentenced to 13 
years in prison he was released under mandatory supervision in 
october 1986 after serving five years and eight months in prison 
bridge a native of fauquier county va said he was in trouble 
since he was 8 he grew up in albany ga and before moving to 
texas he served 13 months of a 15year prison term for burglary in 
georgia 
bridge said in a recent interview that he was sorry rose died 
but complained his life on death row was worse than the shooting 
victims fate 
i sit here on death row for 7 years and think about dying 
and i believe mr rose got a better deal he said i keep 
wishing they would hurry up and do something i tell you this 
place will drive you crazy 
during his time on death row bridge was implicated in the 
bombing of another inmates cell and the nonfatal stabbing of a 
second inmate in incidents blamed on prison gang warfare bridge 
also was linked to membership in the aryan brotherhood a white 
supremacist prison gang 
im not affiliated he said in the interview im friends 
with everybody and now ive got a black attorney its a touchy

solidaritys lech walesa appeared to stand 
firm wednesday on the issue of legalizing his federation on the 
eve of a second preparatory meeting with authorities before talks 
on polands future 
there is no freedom without solidarity he told reporters 
upon arriving in warsaw from his home in gdansk 
walesa refused to confirm he will be meeting with communist 
authorities on thursday when pressed for comment on the talks the 
leader of the outlawed free trade union movement replied we will 
know more tomorrow 
government spokesman jerzy urban said a meeting of walesa 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak and two or three other 
people would take place at noon thursday to resolve obstacles to 
convening the talks 
walesa said he planned to remain in warsaw through friday before 
departing for the southern city of czestochowa to attend a workers 
pilgrimage over the weekend at the jasna gora monastery 
elsewhere members of the official union for transport workers 
in gdynia idled bus and streetcar service in that baltic port city 
of 250000 for about six hours wednesday to protest their pay a 
union spokesman said 
walesa earlier this month ended a series of solidarityled 
strikes in exchange for the promise of talks on the federations 
future 
but the brief gdynia stoppage was mounted by an official trade 
union created after solidarity was outlawed in 1982 
regional official union spokesman stanislaw koscielak said the 
transport workers want a pay increase of 6 a month which they were 
promised last year but never received average pay nationwide is 
about 100 monthly 
koscielak claimed the strike was legal under a 1982 law that 
allows strikes after a period of negotiation and arbitration a 
spokesman at the main depot who refused to give his name said 
drivers began striking at 5 am but went back to work at 11 am 
the official trade union alliance known by its polish initials 
opzz has been pressing the government to liberalize the laws on 
the right to strike it has complained that denying official unions 
the strike weapon undermines their credibility with workers 
the government acknowledges widespread worker unhappiness this 
years inflation rate has climbed to 60 percent with supplies of 
consumer goods to stores even more erratic than usual because of 
increased exports to offset polands 39 billion foreign debt

dominican republic civil defense officials said six people died 
and 60000 were left homeless in jamaica on monday officials there 
said

length of jamaica leaving a trail of wreckage behind it 
it will take us some time before we can assess the full damage

1935 storm that killed 408 people in florida and hurricane 
camille which devastated the mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 
256 people 
the people who need to be concerned now are those people over

sheets said 
mexicos news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in 
the yucatan resorts of cancun and cozumel island

swept into the ocean 
glenn baxter of belgrade lakes me said he spoke with a ham 
operator in jamaica who told him the roof of a hospital in 
mandeville ripped off and the hospital has caved in and that is 
the worst horror show that ive heard about because that would 
imply that a lot of people could have been hurt 
the jamaican consulate in miami said today it had n immediate 
information on the extent of damages or casualties 
jamaica was still out of contact with the rest of the world by 
telephone

a house staff report says us experts in 
covert intelligence and psychological operations exceeded their 
authority in helping rally public support for president reagans 
central america policies 
the house foreign affairs committee staff said tuesday these 
operatives conspired through the staff of the national security 
council to use the state department as a cover for a domestic 
operation which went far beyond the legal and ethical scope of 
their authority 
individuals and organizations working in the 198386 operation 
raised and spent money to influence congressional votes and the 
us news media the report said 
the domestic political and propaganda operation was run 
through the state departments office of public diplomacy for latin 
america and the caribbean known as slpd according to the 
committees chief counsel r spencer oliver and staff consultant 
bert hammond 
the office reported directly to the national security council 
rather than through the normal state department channels a system 
established over the objections of secretary of state george p 
shultz 
the staff report said many of the activities on behalf of 
reagans central american policies were carried out by recipients 
of nobid contracts hidden from public view 
some of the organizations with nobid contracts also were part 
of former nsc aide oliver l norths secret program to raise money 
for the nicaraguan contra rebels north used these fundraising 
efforts along with funds diverted from us arms sales to iran in 
an elaborate scheme to aid the contras at time when congress had 
banned such aid 
reagan when asked about the report by reporters tuesday held 
his thumb and forefinger about an inch apart to show how much 
attention he thought the study deserved 
one day i promise you in a paragraph only about that long 
im going to tell you the truth about irancontra as i did when it 
first came to light and which no one is reporting today he said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated that reagan 
may write more than a paragraph calling the allegations old 
hat fitzwater said the president plans to tell his side of the 
irancontra affair in a book that reagan will author after leaving 
office 
he feels it has been told but that it just keeps coming up 
over and over again and people forget the original answers and the 
original investigations the spokesman said 
the report did not cite any laws or presidential directives that 
were violated and it was not endorsed by the foreign affairs 
committee members it was sent to the panels chairman dante b 
fascell dfla 
hammond said the committee staff has asked the congressional 
research service of the library of congress to investigate whether 
the operation violated laws restricting cia domestic activities 
government lobbying and use of appropriated money for domestic 
propaganda purposes 
while many of the activities of the office of public diplomacy 
have been reported extensively in the past the new study 
emphasized the role of intelligence experts applying their craft in 
a domestic operation instead of the foreign covert operations for 
which they were trained 
a presidential executive order on intelligence activities says 
us covert operations cannot include an effort to influence the 
public opinion or public policy of the united states 
while the transfer of intelligence operatives to domestic 
agencies is not improper under the order the activities they 
perform could violate the order according to congressional 
intelligence experts 
the report said donald gregg a former highranking cia official 
who is now national security adviser to vice president george bush 
initiated the recommendation that led to the assignment of former 
cia propaganda expert walter raymond jr to the nsc group that 
directed the public diplomacy office 
bush the gop presidential nominee has been questioned during 
the campaign about his role as chief of a reagan administration 
task force on central america policy and his association with gregg 
raymond according to the report was instrumental in 
facilitating the assignment of intelligence personnel from the 
department of defense to slpd and the expansion of state 
department resources available to slpd the report said 
on one occasion the report said five intelligence 
experts from the armys 4th psychological operations group at fort 
bragg nc were assigned to work with the office then headed by 
otto reich the current us ambassador to venezuela

the agriculture department wants to change the 
rules governing the labels on american hot dogs but is proceeding 
over the objections of a white house regulatory official 
department officials thought a proposal to allow processors to 
include salvaged meat and ground bone in their recipes without 
explicitly noting the contents in product labels would be in line 
with president reagans policy of stripping away some of the layers 
of federal regulation 
the proposal would allow up to 10 percent mechanically reclaimed 
meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs and a number of similar items 
without explicitly noting the contents in product labels 
when animals are slaughtered most of the red meat is cut or 
scraped from bones by hand but a lot of edible tissue clings to 
the bones and gristle particularly in neck bones ribs joints and 
other hardtoscrape places 
the bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a 
grinder and forced through fine sieves although most of the bones 
are strained out the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone 
about the size of ground pepper 
under current regulations the salvaged meat and bone chips are 
allowed in up to 20 percent of the meat portion of these products 
but the labels must state that the products contain the reclaimed 
mixture 
the mixture is known as mechanically separated meat or msm 
although current regulations describe it as mss to acknowledge 
the species of animal involved thus salvaged meat from a hog 
would be mechanically separated pork or msp 
according to a group of meat processors who asked usda for the 
rule change no company at present is commercially producing mss 
for consumer products because of unwarranted negative 
connotations associated with the term mss 
the usda plan did not set well with jay plager administrator of 
information and regulatory affairs in the office of management and 
budget he told usda in a letter on aug 19 that the proposed rule 
change does not appear to be consistent with several of the 
administrations basic regulatory principles 
plager added nor does it appear that the potential benefits 
to society of this regulation outweigh the potential cost to 
society 
christopher hicks the usdas general counsel replied that 
department officials do not agree with the conclusions set 
forth by plager 
there are compelling reasons for proposing this rule 
including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that 
outweigh societal costs hicks told plager in a sept 6 letter 
copies of the letters by plager and hicks were provided to the 
associated press on tuesday 
advocates of the rule change contend that consumers wont buy 
products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them 
about it 
the proposal which began a 60day rulemaking procedure on sept 
9 was announced on monday by the departments food safety and 
inspection service 
under various names mss has been authorized for use in the 
meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal 
challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product 
itself or labeling requirements 
according to the plan which will be open for public comment 
until nov 8 processors would be able to use mss to comprise up 
to 10 percent of the meat in franks bologna luncheon meats 
sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels 
however the label would have to indicate the percentage of the 
recommended daily allowance of calcium that the product contained 
calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue 
the american meat institute a private association that 
represents meat packers and processors said in a statement that 
the use of calcium on labels would be a more meaningful and 
useful term to consumers than mss particularly to those who 
have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium 
and should be warned away from such products 
in its brief statement the institute said there is no 
wholesomeness or safety issue involved in the mss proposal 
but plager said the assertion that consumers would avoid 
products labeled as containing mss had not been documented in the 
proposed rule change 
furthermore if one accepts the assertion that some consumers 
would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain 
mss why should this information be omitted from the label he 
said 
plager said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome 
food safety regulations we must also provide consumers with 
more rather than less information about food products so that 
they may reach informed market decisions

hispanic candidates continued to make gains in 
local state and federal elections this year and now hold 3360 
elective positions nationwide said a report released today 
the national association of latino elected and appointed 
officials said the number of hispanic elected officials increased 
by 13 percent this year based on elections from august 1987 to 
august 1988 
harry pachon national director of the association said 
measuring the number of hispanic elected officials is a good 
barometer of hispanic progress in the political arena the 
association is a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization 
with more than 3300 members 
president reagan on tuesday proclaimed this week as national 
hispanic heritage week saying people of hispanic descent have 
written countless chapters in the unique saga of the united 
states 
most of the hispanic elected officials hold municipal and school 
board seats association researcher luis baquedano said a breakdown 
of party membership was not available because many local officials 
do not run as democrats or republicans 
the association said the largest gains were made in the 
southwest with texas accounting for 1611 of the elected officials 
and new mexico coming in second with 595 texas has the nations 
secondlargest hispanic population with 41 million of the 
nations estimated 194 million hispanics 
california with the countrys largest hispanic population at 
66 million had 466 hispanic elected officials 
new york with a thirdranked hispanic population of 21 
million had 68 elected latino leaders fewer than states with 
smaller hispanic populations such as arizona with 237 elected 
officials and colorado with 157 
other states with doubledigit numbers of elected hispanics were 
florida 50 new jersey 44 illinois 28 connecticut 15 and 
washington 12 
hispanics hold 11 seats in the us house but none in the 
senate there is one hispanic governor bob martinez of florida

an independent education group says its survey 
of american schools and education officials indicates there is no 
shortage of qualified teachers despite frequent talk to the 
contrary 
the facts are that there is no teacher shortage c emily 
feistritzer of the national center for education information said 
tuesday 
she said the groups teacher supply and demand surveys 1988 
report shows that not only is the alleged teacher shortage 
unsubstantiated the teaching market was glutted with some school 
districts maintaining large applicant lists 
the centers surveys conducted june 28aug 28 were directed 
at teacher certification and education offices across the nation 
75 school districts and more than 1000 individuals who had been 
seeking teaching jobs 
the national education association disputed the results with 
nea spokesman howard carroll saying past nea surveys indicated that 
vacancies reported during the summer months usually were not filled 
by new fulltime hires in september 
these school districts say they hired temporaries or 
substitutes reassigned teachers aides misassigned teachers 
eliminate or reduce course offerings he said we generally 
find that 20 percent of the schools will increase class size 
this is merely a smokescreen to mask the hiring of temporaries 
and uncertified teachers he said 
feistritzer said the state boards maintained that all their 
teachers were certified and noted that many had a policy of placing 
all new hires on a probationary or temporary status 
she acknowledged that the surveys found a shortage in bilingual 
and special education teachers but ascribed the outcry over a 
teacher shortage partly to political considerations 
as long as you keep presenting a crisis youve got control 
over what happens to solve it she said and i do think the 
unions have held onto this prediction it does give them control 
over who gets into the profession 
the centers surveys also found 
teachers are not leaving the profession at the rate predicted 
and many who left the field are trying to reenter it cited 
american federation of teachers data showing a decrease in 
retirements from 24 percent in 198586 to 22 percent in 198687 
aft figures also indicated that 53 percent of new hires in 198788 
were reentering teachers up from the 50 percent in 198687 
data from the school districts indicate that recent college 
graduates comprise 50 percent to 60 percent of applicants for 
teaching positions at least 20 percent are former teachers trying 
to reenter the field or are substitute or parttime teachers 
seeking fulltime status and at least 4 percent are people making 
midcareer changes or retirees wanting to become teachers 
those applying and getting hired are older highly educated 
academically able and experienced 
the average age of those responding to the centers job bank 
advertisements for qualified teachers was 38 with 40 percent 
being 40 or older thirtyfive percent of those hired were 40 or 
older 
half of those job applicants responding were willing to teach 
in rural areas and another 46 percent were willing to teach in 
inner city schools sixtyeight percent of those who applied and 
were not hired said the market was glutted there were no vacancies 
or too many applicants

president reagan is releasing 188 million in 
overdue us payments to the united nations after becoming 
convinced that the world body has reformed some administrative and 
budgetary procedures 
at the same time the white house said reagan told the state 
department to work out a multiyear repayment plan involving 
some 520 million in arrearages that have piled up in recent years 
because of us dissatisfaction with the way the un was run 
in announcing these decisions the president called on the 
united nations to continue progress in areas where reform remains 
incomplete spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters tuesday 
the president reiterated the commitment of the us to assist 
the un in its reform program as well as in its new peace keeping 
efforts he said 
in addition to the roughly 520 million in late dues payments 
the united states is in arrears to the tune of 1118 million in 
the assessments it is supposed to pay toward the separate un 
peace keeping budget 
the united states pays 25 percent of the cost of running the 
united nations and 31 percent of the cost of the peace keeping 
operations 
reagan is scheduled to visit the united nations for two days 
later this month and will address the general assembly on sept 
26 he also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in new 
york 
considering the financial burden the united states shoulders for 
the united nations both the administration and a majority in 
congress have concluded there has been too little accountability 
from the un 
but fitzwater said the un has made progress toward 
streamlining and improving budgetmaking procedures and cracking 
down on the hiring of temporary employees for the secretariat he 
also said that where us interests are concerned the political 
environment had improved 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters as 
he left un headquarters in new york that reagans decision is a 
very positive development which i very much welcome and which 
alleviates our difficulties of course it is not the end of our 
financial problems but it will alleviate them very much 
in an earlier statement issued on his behalf perez de cuellar 
said until the outstanding contributions by all member states 
are paid the organization will continue to operate with inadequate 
current income and virtually without reserves 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said reagans actions breathe new life into 
our hopes for world peace 
rep jim leach riowa a member of the house foreign affairs 
committee said the reagan decision appears to signal a new era 
of cooperation rather than confrontation with the united nations 
the only question is whether congress has the vision and the 
fortitude to reverse course and follow the presidents lead 
fitzwater said reagan will release 44 million which was 
withheld in fiscal 1988 and 144 million which was withheld in 
fiscal 1989 he will request full funding of the united nations in 
fiscal 1990 which amounts to approximately 476 million 
the 44 million will be released immediately fitzwater said 
while the 144 million that had been earmarked in fiscal 1989 
beginning oct 1 will be set free after the first of next month 
the spokesman noted that congress required the president to 
determine that the united nations had made reforms including 
cutbacks in the un secretariat the hiring of temporary 
employees and improved budgeting procedures 
fitzwater said reagan was convinced that the united nations had 
made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted 
the increasing peace keeping role of the world body in such hot 
spots as afghanistan namibia and the persian gulf 
we have seen in the last six months some important reforms in 
terms of the budget and hiring practices and so forth and so that 
has been a determining factor he said 
during the seven and a half years of this administration the 
president has sought to change the political environment 
fitzwater said 
although the reform is incomplete the progress is striking 
he said 
the aim he said was to prod the united nations to become an 
even greater force for peace throughout the world 
vernon walters the us ambassador to the united nations had 
said in late july that the united states hoped to pay 188 million 
of its debt to the united nations before the year was out to help 
prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of 
heightened peace keeping activities 
testifying july 29 before the senate foreign relations 
committee walters said that if progress were reached at resolving 
such world problems as soviet occupation of afghanistan the cuban 
presence in angola a transition to independence for namibia and 
thevietnamese occupation of cambodia the un could face an annual 
peace keeping bill of more than 15 billion 
all of these are important to the interests of the united 
states and all are likely to involve the united nations 
significantly he said at the time this increase in activity 
takes place at a time when the un is facing a very tight cash 
situation

the senate abandoned an effort to expand 
federal coverage for medicaid abortions in the face of strong 
opposition from the house and the white house 
the senate in july had voted 7319 to allow federal financing 
for medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest 
but it backed down on tuesday in a bow to political reality 
under current law federal spending for medicaid abortions is 
permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a womans life 
the house reaffirmed its support for that policy last week and in 
the process rejected the senates proposal for rape and incest 
exceptions 
president reagan had promised to veto a 140 billion spending 
bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of 
labor health and human services and education if it came to him 
with the senates abortion provision 
the senate on tuesday voted 4743 to kill a motion insisting on 
the expanded medicaid abortion coverage it had approved earlier 
its stand up and be counted time said sen lowell weicker 
rconn the chief proponent of expanded medicaid coverage 
were going to see how politically expedient we want to be 
added sen james exon dneb sponsor of the provision adopted by 
the senate in july 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the subcommittee that 
handled the spending bill told his colleagues it would be futile 
to resist the will of the house and white house 
were talking about a house that were 50 votes short in 
were talking about a president thats going to veto the bill 
were talking about a clock thats ticking chiles said 
countered exon sometimes i think we quiver and retreat all 
too soon 
it took chiles two tries to kill weickers motion insisting on 
the senate abortion position he lost the first vote 4644 but 
prevailed on the second 4743 
the outcome was hailed by the national righttolife committee 
as a sharp setback for the proabortion movement and those 
groups who label themselves prochoice had to agree 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion 
rights action league said politics played a heavy role in the 
vote 
arms got twisted so that our friends voted against us she 
said they deserted us in the interest of pragmatic politics 
its clear they didnt want this bill to be held up 
we are terribly disappointed said david andrews executive 
director of the planned parenthood federation of america these 
are clearly cases that cry out for public funding 
antiabortion forces got a big boost last week from reagan who 
wrote a letter to congressional leaders reiterating his veto threat 
the senate language would permit the use of federal funds for 
the slaughter of unborn children depriving the innocent of the 
most basic of civil rights the right to life reagan said in 
the letter i urge the congress to vote to protect the lives of 
americas unborn children 
weicker charged that the administration was trying to use 
their last gasp and their last piece of political capital to deny 
abortions to rape and incest victims 
fourteen states and the district of columbia pay for medicaid 
abortions but they receive federal reimbursement only in 
lifethreatening cases

hundreds of thousands of operations ranging 
from corner service stations to giant oil companies are being 
subjected to the first federal rules aimed at preventing 
contamination of groundwater by underground tanks 
almost 2 million tanks roughly 97 percent of them holding 
gasoline or some other petroleum product are covered by a 370page 
set of regulations released tuesday by the environmental protection 
agency 
the rules apply to new tanks starting in december but give 
owners until december 1998 to bring all existing tanks up to the 
new standards 
the rules require protection against corrosion either 
electrical devices or plastic liners for steel tanks or use of 
nonsteel tanks leak detection systems which may be inventory 
recordkeeping in some cases if an annual tightness test is 
performed and devices to prevent spills and overfilling 
existing tanks gradually will come under the regulations the 
oldest tanks first tanks that are 25 years old or of unknown age 
will have to get a leak detection system by december 1989 
tanks may be exempted from the rules if a corrosion expert 
certifies that they will not corrode in the particular soil theyre 
in but epa expects this to be rare 
home heating oil tanks and fuel tanks of less than 1100 gallons 
for noncommercial home or farm use are not covered 
epa surveys have shown that anywhere from 10 percent to 30 
percent of the 750000 installations with tanks are having or have 
had a significant leak and anywhere from 8000 to 10000 tanks are 
involved in some kind of cleanup project 
concerned that a gallon of gasoline can contaminate a million 
gallons of groundwater congress in 1984 required the epa to adopt 
the regulations and two years later allocated 500 million to help 
with cleanups 
the agency said it tightened provisions for piping from an april 
1987 draft because of growing evidence that many leaks start there 
rather than in the tank itself 
however environmental groups criticized the agency for failing 
to require doublewalled tanks or other doublebarrier containment 
systems for gasoline tanks the agency specified their use only for 
some 60000 chemical tanks 
it will cost a lot more to clean up after the fact than it 
would to put in doublewalled tanks to begin with said morgan 
gopnik an engineer with the environmental action foundation 
epa is leaving the us supply of drinking water vulnerable to 
petroleum contamination said staff scientist lois epstein of the 
environmental defense fund 
the regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the 
regulated community not to protect the environment and the public 
from the hazards of petroleum contamination she said 
although the agency didnt perform a costbenefit calculation 
j winston porter assistant epa administrator for solid waste and 
emergency response said that secondary containment is quite 
expensive and would add unspecified billions to the cost of the 
final regulations 
whether youre mom and pop or exxon it doesnt make a lot of 
sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground the liability 
is enormous porter said 
a service station with three 5000gallon tanks might have to 
spend 3000 to 8000 on a leak detection system and 10000 to 
48000 on an electrical rustprevention system epa estimated 
the agency estimated the benefits from reduced spills in future 
years at 73 billion in todays dollars with costs to tank owners 
at 54 billion 
a dozen states have tank programs of their own and any state 
may operate a more stringent regulatory program than the national 
rules if the epa approves 
the regulations become effective 90 days from publication in the 
federal register expected any day

as president reagan follows vice president 
george bush into missouri he is taking his campaign for the 
republican ticket to a state he carried narrowly in 1980 and 
resoundingly four years ago 
reagan was flying today to cape girardeau a shipping center on 
the mississippi river for a rally at southeast missouri state 
university and then on to st louis to address 1000 guests at a 
250aplate fundraising dinner 
the general thrust of both of these speeches is support for 
the republican ticket acknowledgement of the economic successes of 
this administration discussion of the differences between liberals 
and conservatives white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
tuesday 
the first rally speech may focus a little more on the economy 
and the second one a little more on military strength the 
spokesman said but they will both be traditional political 
speeches covering the themes that the president has discussed in 
the past 
the president plans one or two speaking forays each week until 
the nov 8 election 
gop candidates who will benefit from the missouri events include 
gov john ashcroft seeking a second term against democratic state 
rep betty hearnes of charleston the wife of former gov warren 
hearnes and sen john danforth opposed by state sen jay nixon of 
hillsboro as he seeks his third term 
both ashcroft and danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state 
public opinion polls 
bush speaking tuesday in jefferson city the state capital 
pledged we will never go back to the grainembargo days of those 
democrats carter and mondale and who knows who else 
reagan took missouris 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the 
popular vote against thenpresident carter in 1980 and swept the 
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against walter mondale in 
1984 
records showed that the only incumbent president to visit cape 
girardeau previously was william howard taft on oct 26 1902 
reagan will speak at the yearold show me center 
in st louis the states most populous city with a metropolitan 
area population of more than 2 million the president will speak at 
the omni hotel st louis at an event for the missouri gop victory

a new effort to end the impasse between the 
united states and the philippines over the terms of us access to 
strategic bases in the philippines ended with no apparent narrowing 
of differences 
there has been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer 
together philippines foreign secretary raul manglapus told 
reporters after a 45minute meeting tuesday with secretary of state 
george p shultz at the state department 
the major issue in the talks is us compensation to the 
philippines for use of the bases 
manglapus who also plans meetings with defense secretary frank 
carlucci and congressional leaders during his visit said the two 
sides are not far apart on a cash aid figure but that there has 
been no agreement on other components of an aid package 
manglapus declined to provide details of the aid figures being 
discussed but congressional sources and reports in the philippines 
indicated he is asking for about 12 billion annually over the 
next two years 
this would represent a sizeable increase over the 180 million a 
year to which the reagan administration has been committed since 
1983 in addition to cash aid the philippines also is said to be 
seeking trade concessions debt relief and other soft 
components as manglapus described them 
the administration reportedly has offered 360 million yearly in 
1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions 
for a total of just under 500 million 
shultz said last week the filipino demands were out of 
bounds adding that we will be patient and we will be 
persistent in efforts to overcome the impasse 
the state department had no comment on the meeting with 
manglapus the talks revolve around the terms for continued 
american use of subic bay naval base and clark air base two of the 
most important us facilities outside the united states 
the ongoing talks involve other issues including the presence 
of us nuclear weapons at the bases but most of the attention has 
focused on compensation 
manglapus said a substantial aid increase is warranted partly to 
correct what he suggested was a historical injustice contending 
that the united states used military facilities in the philippines 
for more than 70 years without compensating filipino authorities 
in other countries he said the united states has provided aid 
immediately after establishing military bases 
manglapus said american analysts have concluded that the bases 
benefit the united states more than the philippines because there 
is no external threat to the philippines today

walt whitman the poet during a oneman show that depicts the 19th 
century literary master on the day after his 70th birthday 
i would say he is the most singular man since christ in his 
work ives said in a recent interview i believe he had that 
kind of freedom understanding and compassion emerson termed 
leaves of grass the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom 
but the victorian world wasnt ready for whitmans celebration of 
the human body and spirit 
ives 79 who won an academy award for best supporting actor for 
the big country in 1958 and wife dorothy chose to write the 
script for the mystic trumpeter whitman at 70 because they 
were unable to find a playwright who was as familiar with whitmans 
works as they were 
i have a feeling that we had little to do with creating this 
play ives said it was more instinct and feeling and it just 
dropped into place i think we both got lots of help from the man 
himself

farm lawmakers are moving to impose an 
eightyear deadline for the completion of safety research on 
hundreds of chemicals that are used to protect crops from damaging 
pests 
the plan aimed at toughening federal regulation because of 
growing concern about potential health hazards won house 
agriculture committee apprval tuesday on a voice vote and now heads 
to the house floor 
under the legislation the environmental protection agency would 
have eight years to complete its safety reviews of hundreds of 
pesticides 
the agency working under no deadline has been finishing 
reviews of about two dozen chemicals a year since the mid1970s 
when it took over the job from the agriculture department 
the legislation also would largely end government payments to 
chemical companies to buy up supplies of recalled pesticides such 
payments have totaled 20 million so far 
critics say the cost of these indemnities has caused the epa 
to drag its feet in proceeding with the safety reviews under the 
bill chemical companies and the agency would share the cost of 
storing and disposing of the pesticides and manufacturers would 
bear the costs of conducting the reviews 
lawmakers have been stymied since 1983 in efforts to reauthorize 
the 1949 federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 
fifra they had been saying no action was likely until next year 
committee approval of the latest bill however signaled an 
effort to send legislation to the president before congress 
adjourns next month few however expressed much enthusiasm for 
what they called a modest effort in which the lack of farreaching 
features could prove the key to political success 
committee aides issued a bill summary headlined fifra lite 
i doubt very much that theres a man on the dais who thinks 
that were doing the right thing but were doing what we have to 
do rep charles stenholm dtexas told the committee 
he said recalled pesticides currently in storage should be 
burned but that lawmakers lacked the political will to push through 
legislation requiring it 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
said the problem was that no lawmaker wanted the incinerator in his 
or her home district 
environmentalists were concerned about the absence of any 
provision calling for federal regulation of pesticides in ground 
water which represents the basic drinking supply for half of all 
americans but they said the legislation could be worse 
like the first law of medicine they have done no harm said 
rick hind of the us public interest research group an 
organization founded by ralph nader that has waged a long pesticide 
safety battle 
the group issued a report tuesday saying a search of epa records 
showed 73 pesticides have been found in ground water in 34 states 
a slight increase over previous reports from the agency 
putting off action on ground water is better than doing 
something awful on ground water which is what they would have 
done said maureen hinckle lobbyist from the national audubon 
society 
pesticide regulation in this country is a public health 
scandal that affects each and every consumer said michelle 
meier consumers union counsel for government affairs this clean 
piece of legislation shows that congress is serious about tackling 
the problem once and for all this year 
farmers and exterminators use some 26 billion pounds of 
pesticides in the united states every year perhaps 40000 products 
are sold but they are basically formulations of 656 active 
ingredients 
an outgrowth of world war ii chemical warfare research 
pesticides have played a major part in increasing crop yields and 
placing betterlooking farm products on grocers shelves but some 
of the chemicals have been found to cause cancer and other severe 
health problems in laboratory animals

airline pilots must fly when passengers want to 
travel early in the morning late at night across continents and 
oceans regardless of the vagaries of delays and bad weather 
despite these grueling schedules however dangerous fatigue is not 
inevitable this final story in a threepart ap extra series 6 
miles up and sleepy examines ways of coping with sleepiness in 
the cockpit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
one oftenproposed solution to the dangers of pilot fatigue is 
legalization of a remedy that is obvious and widely practiced but 
forbidden naps in the cockpit 
passengers may blanch at the idea of their captain snoozing 
while they watch a movie six miles above the earth but sleep 
researchers contend this is a sensible way to cope with the flight 
crew exhaustion caused by latenight arrivals earlymorning 
departures and timezone crossings 
while air travel is generally safe the experts say it could be 
safer still if human frailties were considered in the design of 
flight rules pilot schedules and the planes themselves 
some in the flying business however are reluctant to 
acknowledge fatigue as a concern the federal aviation 
administration has publically voiced skepticism that sleepy pilots 
create a hazard in the skies the airlines seem to fear that 
proposed rule changes would make scheduling more difficult and 
some pilots fret that they would lose the large blocks of free time 
they now enjoy 
industry observers moreover contend that one of the most 
powerful impediments to change is the very image of the airline 
pilot fit trim and male calm confident and capable surely such 
a person can deal with a little thing like sleepiness 
there is a widely held belief that mental toughness good 
management or physical fitness will overcome sleepiness that is 
categorically incorrect said dr david dinges a sleep 
researcher at the university of pennsylvania your brain still 
needs sleep and you get yoursef into serious trouble when you try 
to tough that out 
several approaches are being considered cockpits that monitor 
their operators medicines that help flight crews sleep when off 
duty schedules that figure in the time of departure and the 
direction of travel as well as the length of the work day 
but one of the easiest and simplest solutions is the nap 
its common knowledge that people are napping in the cockpit 
because they are so tired said r curtis graeber a sleep 
scientist at the nasaames research center in california we are 
looking very closely at the potential safety benefits of allowing 
limited napping in the seat 
the us air force encourages its crews to nap on long cargo 
flights and some foreign countries britain and west germany among 
them allow sleeping in airline cockpits under federal aviation 
administration rules however napping is considered careless and 
reckless operation of the aircraft 
yet on the long midflight stretches across continents and 
oceans pilots have little to do but monitor their dials nature 
takes its course in interviews with the associated press pilots 
reported frightening instances of awakening to find their two 
colleagues sound asleep as the airliner cruises through the night 
skies 
graeber proposes that naps be carefully scheduled so each member 
of the flight crew anticipates a rest period 
napping will be very helpful if its ever implemented 
agreed mary carskadon a sleep researcher at brown university it 
makes so much more sense to schedule it in than to all of a sudden 
have all three members of the flight crew asleep because no one is 
scheduled to sleep 
far more difficult the experts agree is improving pilot 
schedules rules set by the faa and union agreements dictate how 
many hours a day pilots can be on duty and in the air but the 
standards allow myriad permutations of day and night departures and 
arrivals that often leave crews out of synchronism with their 
internal circadian clocks 
i think pilot scheduling is as good as it can be right now 
reflecting what we know said alan mcartor head of the faa as 
we understand it better the scheduling i think will reflect 
that 
mcartor and airline officials are awaiting results of research 
now being conducted jointly by nasa the airline pilots association 
and united airlines 
beginning this fall graeber and other researchers will fly with 
pilots on long overocean routes monitoring their body 
temperatures and brain waves as they fly through the night 
the resulting advice may not please either pilots or airlines 
pilots often vehement critics of schedules might find their 
flight time spread over a longer calendar period eliminating the 
intense two to three weeks of flying that gives them the rest of 
the month off

airlines already pinched by deregulatory competition and a 
pilot shortage may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying 
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced 
schedules 
faa scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s 
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a 
day among those who think they can be improved is john lauber a 
sleep researcher on the national transportation safety board 
an arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory 
rest time that doesnt take into account circadian factors is 
simply not 20th century he said we know that an hour of sleep 
is not an hour of sleep depending on when you take it one of the 
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to 
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately 
the experts contend that schedules should consider the time of 
departure the number of time zones crossed and the direction of 
travel the body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east 
than east to west 
another part of the problem is the plane itself the modern 
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber the lights are 
dim the seats are comfortable the air rushes past with a soothing 
hum 
planes are so automated that they quite literally fly 
themselves except while landing and taking off there is often 
little for crew members to do the newest planes dont even require 
a flight engineer so standard crew size is being reduced from 
three members to two some pilots and sleep experts complain that 
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off 
the fewer people in the cockpit the fewer safeguards you 
have said dr martin mooreede of harvard a sleep expert at 
harvard medical school its easier for two people to nod off 
than three 
but delmar fadden a boeing administrator asserts just the 
opposite is likely if there are only two in the cockpit both 
know that they cant rely on a third person so they are more 
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to 
allow themselves to go to sleep 
fadden who establishes design requirements for the boeing 747 
and 767 said we cant do a lot about the fact that the crew 
might be fatigued what we try to do is make the airplane tolerant 
of the crews reaction 
this means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored 
drowsy inattentive pilots if something goes wrong such as a 
generator failure the plane automatically compensates without 
waiting for the crew to act 
fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews 
alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes such a lapse 
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse 
another possible solution used by the british during the 
falkland islands crisis is a drug to help pilots sleep before 
night flights bill storm a psychologist at brooks air force base 
in san antonio texas said the us military is experimenting with 
the drug temazepam 
all of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance 
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather equipment 
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster 
we run a very safe air transportation system said lauber 
but we are pushing people harder we know from anecdotal data 
that people are not as alert as they should be they are falling 
asleep in some circumstances i think its appropriate that we 
reexamine the way we approach these things

leave los angeles at 815 pm and fly 5 hours to honolulu 
rest the second day but leave late that night at 1 am which 
is 4 am los angeles time for the 8hour flight to auckland 
new zealand where you wait 90 minutes then fly three more hours to 
sydney australia after a days rest in australia you do the same 
thing in reverse landing back in los angeles seven days after you 
left 
or consider this schedule 
leave boston at 615 am fly two hours to cincinnati leave an 
hour later on a 4hour flight to los angeles twelve hours after 
landing youre back in the cockpit flying all night to cincinnati 
and after an hour on the ground on to newark arriving back on 
the east coast 26 hours after you left 
it is schedules like these the first flown by united airlines 
crews the second by delta airlines that pilots say wear them 
down sometimes leaving them groggy and prone to mistakes 
what were doing with these schedules is taking human beings 
and saying lets get the maximum out of them said one united 
captain interviewed by the associated press who asked not to be 
identified out of concern for his job as a result weve got 
crews who are in rough shape out there 
yet another united captain who makes transpacific flights said 
his most recent sixday tour of duty went like this 
1015 am arrive los angeles international airport for 1135 
jumbo jet trip to tokyo go through paper work check flight plans 
weather fuel passenger load 
flight promises to be particularly heavy requiring unscheduled 
fuel stop in alaska several passengers fail to show making extra 
stop unnecessary but threatened schedule change and a mixup 
getting departure clearance mean plane is pushed away from the gate 
40 minutes late 
1235 pm after starting the engines taxiing out to runway 
going over checklist plane takes off 
after liftoff we run a sterile cockpit until top of climb 
the captain says that means all business no chitchat no pa 
announcements we check the instruments seeing that the systems 
are running as we expect and check the inertial navigation system 
to make sure it is tracking with ground navigation aids 
the plane leaves the california coast north of san francisco and 
passes over the aleutian islands from then on the flight is 
routine the crew makes regular position checks watches the 
navigational instruments listens to an emergency frequency chats 
with other planes and eats crew meals are better than coach but 
not as fancy as first class 
as plane approaches tokyo about 10 hours after takeoff there 
are more checklists and instructions from air traffic controllers 
you have to screw up your level of concentration because 
insidiously you often are not aware of your fatigue the captain 
says 
248 pm tokyo time following day plane lands at narita 
international airport pilots cockpit time between leaving the 
terminal in los angeles and parking in tokyo block to block as 
they say is 11 hours and 33 minutes 
the crew is on duty for 30 minutes more finishing up paper 
work they clear customs and immigration and are picked up by a bus 
for the 15minute ride to a hotel 
the captain stays up a couple of hours more having dinner 
reading and unwinding he finally goes to sleep at 8 pm which is 
5 am los angeles time he sleeps five or six hours wakes up well 
before dawn he has breakfast reads and exercises at noon he 
tries unsuccessfully to sleep again 
5 pm bus picks up crew for 630 departure for seattle 
before this tour is over the pilot flies back to tokyo via 
anchorage alaska then returns to los angeles when he gets home 
he sleeps 13 hours straight 
such schedules are relatively common and uniformly grueling 
the problem say officials is that to schedule the 18500 daily 
flights to get people where they want when they want to remain 
competitive and costeffective some pilots must fly through the 
night across multiple time zones then come back eight hours later 
and do it again 
typically each airline presents its monthly flights to both 
human schedulers and computers programmed to consider the vagaries 
of economics fuel consumption regulations contracts and human 
and equipment limits 
men and machines come up with possibilities that are 
doublechecked 
we take a look at it based on the safety issues said george 
hof head of flight operations at american airlines the 
computer in optimizing the costs in crewing the series of flights 
will take a look at the duty time available and cram a lot of 
flying into that 
once approved the crew lists are put up for bid the pilots bid 
for schedules based on their desirability and hourly pay rate 
those who fly the bigger faster planes get paid more pilot wages 
range from about 70000 a year to a top of 160000 
according to the airline pilots association the average pilot 
is in the cockpit about 80 hours a month and spends another 80 
hours on duty preparing for flights or waiting for passengers to 
load and unload 
this total of 160 hours is crammed into an average of 16 days a 
month 
management and pilots agree there is little way to avoid some of 
the overnight multiple time zone schedules that test pilots 
endurance 
youre not going to work it all out said dick stone a 
delta captain and chairman of the pilots unions human performance 
committee we work silly hours and thats just the way the 
business is

the burmese army tough disciplined 
and hitherto loyal has emerged as the key power broker in an 
increasingly chaotic country where the authoritarian government is 
besieged by a popular revolt 
only a few of the 186000 soldiers have defected to join masses 
of protesters demanding the militarybacked government step down so 
an interim administration can supervise the first multiparty 
elections in 26 years 
its the only really organized force in the country whoever 
gains its loyalty controls the state burma specialist josef 
silverstein said 
i think the army is still 100 percent behind former 
president ne win and president maung maung theyre in the 
ramparts and i dont see any shift in their loyalty the american 
expert said in an interview 
the government and sole political party could not have withstood 
the last seven weeks of massive demonstrations without solid 
military backing analysts say the army even has been willing to 
gun down unarmed protesters 
the civil service meanwhile is bolting 
the experts speculate however that the military might have 
splintered without behindthescenes maneuvering by retired leader 
ne win architect of both the 1962 coup and the militarys power 
and privilege 
diplomats in rangoon say military units are stockpiling food 
fuel and other vital supplies that are fast disappearing 
the army and other agents of the state have been reported 
encouraging violence looting and rumors perhaps hoping to 
justify a military crackdown led by ne wins old guard which 
includes maung maung 
but rangoon diplomats say opposition leaders tin oo and aung 
gyi both widely respected officers who earlier broke with ne win 
could win the military to their side 
a third possibility is a coup by young turks in combat 
commands who are known to have grown disillusioned with corruption 
inefficiency and the high living of the elite while troops are 
sent to battle rebels armed with rifles that jam in the tropical 
rains 
the sole certainty is that a violent confrontation between the 
army and the opposition would result in great bloodshed 
the few weapons available to students workers and allied groups 
are knives clubs and jinglees homemade poisoned projectiles 
the army although one of the poorestequipped in world has 
been described by military attaches in rangoon as tough lean and 
mean the ranks of its eight light infantry divisions are filled 
by some of the best foot soldiers in asia second only to those of 
vietnam 
the army also has been imbued with what israeli scholar and 
burma expert moshe lissak calls a sense of historic mission 
military men including ne win gained prestige by leading the 
struggle against british colonialism and upon independence in 1948 
found a power vacuum they moved to fill the army also provided 
protection for the burman buddhist heartland against ethnic 
insurgents pressing inward from the frontier 
faced by a plethora of enemies communist and ethnic 
separatists and supported by a weak and uncertain civilian 
government the army leadership developed the ability to function 
independently of civilian control wrote british scholar robert 
taylor in the state in burma 
armed with definite ideas about how to run the country ne wins 
clique seized power in 1962 retired colonels were charged with 
running government departments and exgenerals became ministers 
the results were political repression and economic ruin 
we know the end of the story now but in the 1960s the 
military were looked upon as saviors lissak said they became a 
privileged group with extra pay medical care survivor benefits 
and jobs upon retirement special benefits they can have no desire 
to lose

yale university has endowed faculty 
chairs in numerous esoteric fields now the ivy league schools 
football coach will join that elite company as the joel e smilow 
coach of football 
yale announced tuesday that smilow a 1954 yale graduate and 
president chairman and chief executive officer of stamfordbased 
playtex inc had donated 1 million to endow the head football 
coachs job the first endowed position in the athletic department 
excellence in football is not a core objective of yale or any 
other great institution of higher education said smilow whose 
college football career was limited to intramural touch football 
however it is my belief that football is an integral part of 
the very broad objective of attracting educating and motivating 
persons with the potential to become tomorrows leaders 
irrespective of the field of endeavor which they choose to pursue 
yale officials would not release the salary of yales football 
coach carmen cozza who is entering his 24th season and has 
compiled a record of 139 wins 70 losses and 4 ties school 
officials also would not say how much of the endowment will be used 
to finance the position 
yale president benno c schmidt said smilows gift will help 
carry forward the glorious tradition of varsity football at yale 
but the gift provoked mild disapproval among some students 
the money could go to something else said junior elizabeth 
archley i cant see what else carm cozza could do that would 
warrant such money 
smilow brushed aside the criticism saying the gift would allow 
the university to use money from the coachs salary in other areas 
as an undergraduate smilow broadcast yale football games as 
sports director for wybc the college radio station and said 
during a telephone interview that his secret ambition had been to 
be a brent musburger the sports announcer for cbs 
i love yale and i love football he said 
although football is generally considered a more genteel affair 
in the ivy league than in powerhouse leagues like the southwest 
southeastern big eight and pacific10 conference yale boasts 
among its alumni calvin hill who played as a running back for the 
dallas cowboys after graduating in 1966 and rich diana a 1982 
graduate who played for the miami dolphins 
yale also has more football victories than any other college in 
the nation 743 followed by the university of michigans 684 and 
yale has had 118 players named allamericans

george bush has got a hankering to turn back 
the clock about half a century so he can be a teenager again 
thats what he told a roadside crowd of school children and 
youths who gathered in this rural town to watch his campaign 
motorcade go by tuesday 
speaking on his limousine loudspeaker he told them i must 
confess i wish i was about a junior maybe a senior in high 
school because i see the next decade strong and i see the next 
decade a challenge 
the 300 young people standing on the grounds of tipton high 
school cheered with delight at the vice presidents impromptu 
remarks and the sight of the long motorcade with security agents 
and official looking entourage 
two teachers said the high school was notified by campaign 
officials about 15 minutes ahead of time that the motorcade would 
pass by so the students along with some younger children from an 
elementary school came out to see the excitement 
bush spoke to them for a few minutes saying he just wanted to 
see the home of the undefeated tipton high football team 
bush said he likes to get out to these local communities to 
understand the heartbeat of the united states while a lot of 
people are sitting back in washington or some university wanting 
to knock the system 
bush concluded by pledging himself to work for a more peaceful 
and prosperous world he shook hands with the children who surged 
forward and then his motorcade continued down the country road 
but it was only a few miles before the vice president had an 
encounter with the you cant please everybody department 
there was another quick stop this one at a corner convenience 
store called break time 
it seems the vice president was getting a little hungry on the 
long drive from jefferson city where he had a rally to whiteman 
air force base where his plane awaited 
so bush his wife barbara and their secret service retinue 
trooped into the little store to pick up a couple of slices of 
pizza and some soft drinks 
the vice president told the young woman cashier he was starving 
as he pulled out his wallet and paid for the food 
outside while bush briefly shook hands with a few curious 
onlookers a local police officer was informing other members of 
the entourage that all was not well at the butterfield inn 
restaurant next door 
it seems the proprietor had been told to expect a lunch stop by 
the bush brigade before bush veered off to the convenience store 
hes got that place all set up for the vice president the 
officer said tell him thanks a lot 
asked later aboard air force two whether he was aware of the 
perceived slight bush showed surprise but said we werent 
looking for a big fancy restaurant i didnt want a fancy meal

she might not be any match for them on the 
field but miss america knocked out those big mean football boys in 
the television ratings 
cbs and abc vainly put up college football games against the 
miss america pageant on nbc but they ended up way downfield in 
60th and 62nd places respectively while miss america was no 1 
nbc estimates that between 50 million and 55 million viewers 
watched all or part of the pageant on saturday night giving it a 
rating of 223 and a 44 share higher than last years 204 and 42 
according to the ac nielsen co 
the highestrated miss america pageant was in 1986 it got a 
230 rating and a 44 share 
each rating point represents 886000 homes with televisions the

season for the network in that time period 
for the week that ended sunday nbc won with an average 
primetime rating of 126 to abcs 112 and cbs 93

tying with a rating of 95 nbc nightly news had a 94 each of 
the three got a 20 share cbs news was carried by 98 percent of 
its stations 97 percent for nbc and 96 percent for abc because of

abcs world news tonight nbc nightly news is on its own in 
new york at 7 pm new york represents about 7 percent of the total

with the winds of hurricane gilbert clocked at 175 
miles per hour us weather officials called gilbert the most 
intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere 
mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center 
reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric 
pressure at gilberts center at 2613 inches at 552 pm edt on 
tuesday gilbert was barreling toward mexicos yucatan peninsula 
thats the lowest pressure ever measured in the western 
hemisphere zimmer said the previous record low pressure of 
2635 inches was set by the 1935 labor day hurricane that struck 
the florida keys with winds above 150 mph killing 408 people he 
said 
with tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 
200 miles south of the hurricanes center gilbert also was one of 
the largest but because the circumference of a hurricane changes 
so often during its course no records are kept on their overall 
size said center meterologist jesse moore 
hurricane debby which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to 
hurricane strength before striking mexico last month was probably 
about half that size moore said 
gilbert is one of only three category 5 storms in the hemisphere 
since weather officials began keeping detailed records the others 
were the 1935 labor day hurricane and hurricane camille which 
bulldozed the mississippi coast with 172 mph winds and a 28foot 
wave in 1969 leaving 14 billion in damage and 256 dead 
a 1900 hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster 
in us history however that storm hit galveston texas sept 8 
and killed more than 6000 people 
category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph barometric 
pressure of less than 2717 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 
feet 
the storm surge a great dome of water that follows the eye of 
the hurricane across coastlines bulldozing everything in its path 
accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities 
camilles storm surge was 25 feet high but the hurricane center 
was forecasting a surge of only 812 feet for gilbert zimmer said 
the damage from these worstcase hurricanes is catastrophic 
shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and 
windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed 
moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane zimmer 
said the engine itself is this tall chimney of warm moist air 
in the center if the atmospheric conditions in general allow this 
warm chimney to build to very high levels 1012 miles high then 
you can have a severe hurricane 
category 4 storms cause extreme damage with winds from 131 to 
155 mph surge of 1318 feet and pressure of 2717 to 2790 the 
weakest hurricanes category 1 cause minimal damage with winds of 
74 to 95 mph 45 foot surge and pressure at 2894 or more

this summers drought stunted corn 
wheat and soybean yields in the midwest but some farmers in 
pockets that received rain could reap bumper crops and harvest them 
two weeks early 
weve got good great big ears id say it looks awful good i 
figure the yield will be as good as last year maybe 150 bushels 
an acre says kossuth county farmer william green 
it looks like well average a strong 150 bushels per acre out 
here echoed art benken manager of the farmers cooperative 
elevator in wesley in northcentral iowa thats about double the 
estimated statewide average last year 
state by state estimates of corn and bean yields in mondays 
september crop report from the us agriculture department said 
drought damage has not worsened since the august report 
the corn harvest is estimated at 446 billion bushels a 
fiveyear low more than onesixth of the crop is in iowa where 
the government predicted a harvest of 8112 million bushels the 
smallest in 24 years 
benken said that while most of the midwest was baking under the 
drought wesley was getting timely rain including a drenching in 
the wake of a july 8 tornado that hit about 140 miles southwest 
the tornado that hit council bluffs slowed down when it got 
out here and gave us 35 inches of rain over two and a half days 
he said 
while the corn and bean harvest will be reduced nationwide 
other crops showed an increase according to the report august 
rains helped boost the estimated tobacco yield in kentucky while 
the cotton crop in texas will be the fourthhighest ever 
well probably have a good crop at low prices said carl 
anderson an extension economist in college station texas 
specializing in cotton 
the drought was particularly hard on south dakota wheat farmers 
where the government is estimating a yield of 156 million bushels 
the lowest production since 1959 and down 68 percent from last year 
most producers ive talked to say they can hold on for another 
year said brenda mangin forman executive director of the south 
dakota wheat producers inc but its going to be tough a lot of 
it depends on the drought aid from the government and how they 
decide to work advance deficiency payments next spring 
the national soybean harvest was estimated at a 12year low of 
147 billion bushels down 23 percent from last year but virtually 
unchanged from the august forecast however one expert thought the 
governments numbers were suspect 
generally usda reports will lag on the high side when you 
have a drought said extension marketing specialist lynn lutgen 
of omaha neb he said he is more comfortable with private 
estimates of lower yields 
while the drought has shriveled yields it has also caused the 
corn crop to mature much faster than usual corn normally isnt dry 
enough for market until about oct 1 
at the elevator in wesley benken said farmers are bringing in 
heavy loads of quality grain 
kossuth county extension director john lee said the wesley area 
had 17 inches of rainfall over the summer in addition to 8 inches 
of holdover moisture at planting time 
heck with 25 27 inches of rain you can raise corn he 
said 
other farms in the same county didnt share the wealth of 
wetness 
ive heard estimates ranging all the way from 50 bushels up to 
175 said county soil specialist bill gast in algona 
extension economist bob wisner at iowa state university in ames 
said several factors could lower corn yields below government 
estimates including weak stalks fragile stalks can topple in wind 
or rain making it difficult for mechanical reapers to harvest he 
said 
the drought has left its mark in other businesses as well 
executives of barge companies that ply the nations rivers said 
they had expected to make money in 1988 after struggling for most 
of the decade because of depressed hauling rates but drought 
restrictions have closed some rivers at least temporarily and 
slowed passage through others as well as limited the number of 
barges pushed by one tow and the loads they carry 
finally this year people began to make money until mother 
nature gave us a lousy deal said jeffrey smith vice president 
of the american waterways operators a trade group 
a study commissioned by the group projected that industry this 
year will suffer losses of as much as 200 million on revenues of 
1 billion smith said

federal rules that allow officials to brand a 
documentary movie as propaganda before it is exported must be 
rewritten because they are unconstitutional a federal judge has 
ruled 
the ruling is an interim step in a protracted freedomofspeech 
dispute between the us information agency and a group of largely 
liberal moviemakers who accuse the reagan administration of 
hampering foreign distribution of their films 
the moviemakers attorney david cole on tuesday hailed the 
decision as a rejection of a threat by usia director charles z 
wick to pull out of an international cultural exchange treaty if 
the courts rule against the agency 
wick played his bluff and the court didnt take it cole 
said in a telephone interview from the new york offices of the 
center for constitutional rights the publicinterest lawyers 
group pressing the filmmakers case 
but the usia in a statement said it remains committed to the 
ideals of the cultural exchange treaty called the beirut 
agreement which eases export of movies deemed to have educational 
scientific or cultural value 
we are very concerned about adverse court rulings which 
are interfering with our carrying out our treaty obligations 
faithfully the agency said 
the written ruling issued by us district judge a wallace 
tashima on sept 9 gives the usia 60 days to rewrite its rules for 
certifying documentary movies as educational cultural or 
scientific though the designation isnt needed to export a film 
it eases distribution by allowing dutyfree sale of movies in 70 
countries that have signed the beirut agreement or honor it 
acting on an earlier order from tashima the agency rewrote its 
rules including in the new regulations a provision allowing a film 
to be certified for dutyfree export but tagged propaganda 
tashima rejected those rules in may and ordered a second 
rewrite the latest ruling is on a request to stay that order 
pending an appeal to the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
the dispute began in 1985 when makers of seven documentary 
films on subjects ranging from nicaragua to nuclear war sued the 
usia accusing it of discriminating against movies with liberal 
themes in issuing certificates under the agreement 
agency officials have denied that politics play a role in 
certifying movies under the agreement

the decision by longtime un critic 
president reagan to pay 700 million in back dues to the united 
nations will save the world body from bankruptcy next month and 
keep alive its new peacekeeping force in the persian gulf 
reagans decision came two weeks before he is to address the 
159nation general assembly in his final un appearance 
while the united states has been withholding dues and 
criticizing the united nations its soviet rival has rediscovered 
the value of the organization and started paying its bills moscow 
now promotes the united nations and points a finger at the united 
states 
reagan on tuesday authorized the release of 188 million 44 
million at once and 144 million as soon as funds become available 
it appeared to be a last gesture to the world organization which 
his administration had steadily denounced as biased and bloated 
the president also directed the state department to work out a 
plan over several years for repaying 520 million in legally 
required payments to the organization 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar welcomed reagans 
decision and said he will feel more comfortable in making his 
final address but he added president reagan is always welcome 
perez de cuellar emphasized that financial uncertainty will 
continue until more than 70 member states pay their back dues and 
build up un reserves 
the un chief in the past has gently criticized some in the 
united states the biggest un donor for being wary of 
multilateral diplomacy and considering it an infringement on the 
us right to act unilaterally in the world arena 
foreign diplomats said recent un successes in peacemaking and 
peacekeeping in afghanistan the iraniraq war and southern africa 
appeared to be major factors in persuading the united states to 
release the legal payments it had deliberately withheld 
the united states especially welcomed un mediation of an 
accord under which more than 100000 soviet troops were to withdraw 
from afghanistan 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater announced the us 
decision tuesday saying the government recognizes the increasing 
un peacekeeping role in afghanistan namibia southwest africa 
and the gulf 
although the un reform is incomplete he said the 
progress is striking he said the united states has been 
demanding more accountability from the united nations for its 
spending 
one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the united states had to put its money where its mouth is 
it is difficult for the united states to continue criticizing the 
organization and withholding funds for vital operations that the 
united states welcomes 
un officials have said the united nations would be unable to 
finance the new un peacekeeping force in the gulf and pay un 
staff salaries in october without a substantial payment 
the united states is assessed more than 200 million every year 
by the united nations about a quarter of the regular budget of 
800 million 
the us government and congress had been withholding funds for 
years to pressure the united nations into political administrative 
and budgetary reforms the administration now says it is satisfied 
that reforms although imperfect are significant and are well 
under way 
that will tide the organization over its worst financial crisis 
in years but financial uncertainty will remain until other debtor 
nations pay their arrears 
un budget arrears as of july 31 were 602 million 
peacekeeping arrears totaled an additional 484 million 
the top 10 debtor nations at that time were the united states 
south africa brazil iran the soviet union argentina mexico 
israel poland and romania 
but the soviet union recently paid virtually all of its arrears 
after years of overdue accounts moscow has been seeking to promote 
the united nations as an instrument of a new kind of political 
thinking and has cited the united states for withholding dues and 
opposing multilateralism

city officials have come up with a way to 
lure yuppies out of their porsches and into buses a luxury shuttle 
that offers cushy seats videos wine and bagels 
the 10mile service from downtown to century city is scheduled 
to begin next month 
city councilman zev yaroslavsky who dreamed up the deluxe bus 
hopes it will ease freeway jams by attracting lawyers and other 
professionals wh would rather use the time spent traveling downtown 
to catch up on business than on shifting gears 
what lawyers sell is their time said susan g schaefer 
century city bar association president so if half an hour or an 
hour of time can be spent working rather than dodging cars than 
thats time well spent 
for 750 each way the 18passenger shuttles will provide 
cellular phones televisions video casette recorders and facsimile 
machines said ralph w smith jr president of apt transportation 
which won the contract for the route 
attendants will serve coffee and bagels in the morning and soft 
drinks and wine in the afternoon 
but you cant please everyone one lawyer detected a potential 
drawback 
it definitely would be nice and less tense said attorney 
joel m grossman but my guess is that most lawyers like me 
would be concerned about the down time waiting for the next bus

a businessman and a scientist want 
to put a threearmed robot in chains 
the robot unveiled tuesday at a university of rhode island 
laboratory was billed as the perfect worker for the jewelry 
industry it is so dexterous it can handle delicate gold chain 
solder on parts and delicately twist the clasps on and off 
a person right now who gets tired after an eighthour shift 
can do an average of one chain a minute said philip datseris 
an associate professor of mechanical engineering 
the robot can do two or three a minute stacking them neatly on 
a post as it finishes them said datseris who helped develop the 
machine 
the robot will help us jewelry manufacturers compete with 
imports said albert f wiesner iii president of wiesner 
manufacturing co of providence the chain maker that funded the 
development work 
i had this envisioned in my mind for a couple of years said 
wiesner who earned a degree in mechanical engineering at rhode 
island i had the mechanics down pretty well but i needed help 
with the electronics 
the university designed much of the electronics two of the 
robots arms and the computer program that runs the robot the 
robots main arm came from switzerland 
it has cost about 100000 so far to develop the machine 
datseris said at least six months more is needed before the robot 
is ready for patent said wiesner

supreme court justice harry a blackmun 
says the ideological bent of his newest colleague anthony kennedy 
is critical to the courts direction and might threaten his roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion 
another good indicator of what the future holds the 79yearold 
jurist suggested tuesday will be the civil rights case of 
patterson vs mclean credit union set for oral argument after the 
court begins its term oct 3 
i think the outcome of that case will be of some significance 
as to the movement of the court during the balance of the 20th 
century blackmun told law students at the university of arkansas 
at little rock 
the court stunned civil rights groups in april when it announced 
it wanted to use the patterson case to reexamine a 12yearold 
precedent that held a private allwhite school violated the law in 
refusing to consider black applicants based on their race 
the 1976 case allowed damages to be awarded against private 
parties who discriminate on the basis of race in deciding with whom 
to contract 
blackmun said an aspect of the case that has bothered him was 
the courts decision to reexamine the 1976 precedent on the 
courts own motion that is after neither of the parties brought 
up the issue 
blackmun said he sees the court as currently divided into three 
groups 
the liberals justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan 
jr 
the conservatives chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices antonin scalia sandra day oconnor and apparently 
kennedy 
the moderates himself and justices byron r white and john 
paul stephens iii 
the division blackmun said means that all three moderates must 
align themselves with the two liberals on any given issue to take 
control of the court that the conservatives will control the court 
in some areas he said is almost a foregone conclusion since some 
of the moderates are conservative in areas he said white for 
example almost always lines up with the conservatives in criminal 
cases giving the conservatives their fivemember majority 
blackmun noted it is difficult to classify kennedy yet because 
he participated in only a few of the courts weekly conferences 
there will be a much clearer picture of the alignment next summer 
after the term concludes he said 
blackmun perhaps best known for his 1973 decision in the case 
of roe vs wade which overturned restrictive antiabortion laws in 
texas also warned that the court could reverse that decision 
during the coming term 
he indicated the ruling could turn on how faithful kennedy is to 
the judicial doctrine of stare decisis a policy of courts not 
to disturb a settled point of law 
the next question is will roe vs wade go down the drain 
blackmun said i think theres a very distinct possibility 
that it will this term you can count the votes 
commenting on blackmuns remarks douglas johnson legislative 
director of the national right to life committee accused the 
justice of interjecting himself in the presidential campaign 
apparently blackmun recognizes that roe v wade cannot survive 
merely on its constitutional merits so he is calling for cavalry 
support johnson said

michael dukakis relishes running against dan 
quayle 
is there anybody here today he recently asked a 
shirtsleeve rally in portland ore is there any citizn in the 
united states of america who thinks dan quayle is qualified to be 
the nations drug czar 
loud cheers and hoots from the partisan crowd 
a week later dukakis was in chicago to deliver an address on 
his view of ussoviet relations the kind of speech aides were 
quick to describe as major 
early on he questioned republican nominee george bushs 
judgment with this example 
if he truly believes that j danforth quayle is qualified to 
be one heartbeat away from the presidency how can we trust his 
judgment when americas future is on the line 
dukakis campaign aides make no secret they are convinced quayle 
the junior senator from indiana is a major liability to bush as 
the gop vice presidential nominee 
certainly polls show that most voters think dukakis running 
mate texas sen lloyd bentsen is far more qualified to succeed to 
the presidency than quayle 
but those same polls also show bush gaining not losing ground 
since he picked quayle 
that phenomenon can be explained by a number of factors 
unrelated to quayle 
the big early dukakis lead was illusory based as it was on 
polls taken before voters were giving a moments thought to the two 
candidates 
more important was how dukakis dealt with his perceived setback 
in his campaign to capture the white house 
his first reaction was to heat up his rhetoric but the target 
was more often quayle than bush 
but as tempting a target as quayle might be when dukakis 
attacks him the democratic presidential nominee is in the position 
of spending a lot of time running against the gop vice presidential 
candidate 
its the political equivalent of kicking a small dog the dog 
gets all the sympathy even when he sinks his teeth into the 
kickers ankle 
when bentsen kicks quayle thats a fair fight or when other 
democratic senators take jabs at their gop colleague that too is 
effective 
dukakis has as great a dilemma and fewer options on the other 
principal target of his stump speeches ronald reagan 
twice now in 1980 and 1984 the democrats took their best 
shots at reagan the total score was reagan 93 states jimmy carter 
and walter mondale 7 
when the 1988 campaign started the big question was how bush 
reagans impeccably loyal vice president could separate himself 
from the president how could the vice president establish his own 
identity while refusing to express the slightest disagreement with 
reagan policies 
the question was asked and asked again who was george bush 
what did he stand for 
bush agreed it was a problem but said he thought hed overcome 
it 
with a carefully staged convention and reagans full 
cooperation bush did just that he emerged from new orleans with a 
new public image as his strategists had hoped bush suddenly was 
perceived as the republican presidential nominee no longer as 
reagans vice president 
the reagan problem may now have shifted 
its possible that dukakis is now the candidate having trouble 
separating himself from reagan 
when the democratic nominee wants to attack the record of the 
past seven and a half years he is doing what democrats had hoped 
they would never again have to endure he is campaigning against 
ronald reagan 
there is no easy way out of that dilemma 
to win dukakis must convince voters that its time for a 
substantive change whether they agreed or not with the policies of 
the reagan years 
thats not an easy case to make when most economic statistics 
are favorable and the outgoing president remains very popular 
twentyeight years ago john f kennedy defeated richard m 
nixon but the country had just been through a recession and the 
u2 incident had led to a sharp downturn in ussoviet relations 
dukakis may pull it off but reagan and quayle are not his best 
targets

chest creating a 5inch welt the bullet was removed at meridia

thousands of residents returned 
home tuesday as state fire officials helped by nearly 24 hours of 
favorable weather lifted evacuation notices and reopened major 
highways where a raging timber fire destroyed almost 100 homes 
as far as i know we have allowed everyone who wants to return 
home to do so state department of forestry spokesman steve 
iverson said 
at least 97 homes and 60 other buildings were destroyed and 
4000 to 5000 other structures had been threatened by the 
fastmoving windfanned blaze northeast of sacramento in the 
foothills of the sierra nevada 
in less than 72 hours it blackened more than 52 square miles of 
brush and timber north and west of grass valley and nevada city in 
a halfmoon arc 12 miles long and two to five miles wide 
the fire had been whipped by gusts of 30 mph and above since 
sunday but on tuesday winds were moderate temperatures were 
about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double 
iverson said 
if it holds through the night well consider releasing some 
people tomorrow said iverson planning chief for the 
2788member firefighting force were looking forward to another 
inversion layer wednesday the temperatures should be moderate 
an estimated 8000 people had been evacuated from their homes in 
several communities 
iverson said no additional homes were threatened as of tuesday 
evening but homes inside the fire lines could be threatened if 
winds shift or pick up significantly he added 
by nightfall tuesday firefighters had bulldozed lines around 
more than 35 percent of the 90mile perimeter of the blaze the 
area where it spread thickest on tuesday grasslands in the 
deserted eastern sector of beale air force base also burned out 
the quickest 
the fire was stopped more than four miles from the edge of the 
main part of the base home for some of the nations most 
sophisticated spy planes firefighters said 
its all out its history there are no problems there 
said bill holmes a department of forestry operations chief 
federal fire officials have called this the worst forest fire 
season in the west in 30 years especially considering the fires in 
and around yellowstone national park the fires have charred 
939270 acres of the 22 millionacre park since june 
firefighters there on tuesday took advantage of a cold spell to 
make some headway against the blazes before potentially menacing 
warmer weather sets in 
at one point tuesday in california a wall of flames up to 50 
feet high surrounded three sides of the forested grass valley group 
industrial complex where sophisticated television graphics are 
produced for networks and major stations worldwide 
about 100 people living nearby were temporarily evacuated but 
were allowed to return to their homes before nightfall the complex 
was unharmed 
that complex which employs 1000 people has been cited as one 
of the leading examples of communications and other high technology 
industries which have located in rural areas 
iverson said californias drought conditions which accentuated 
the volume of highly combustible forest materials plus unusually 
high wind and low humidity had combined to create an especially 
dangerous and unpredictable condition 
only seven firefighters were treated at hospitals for minor 
burns no residents were reported injured 
the blaze dubbed the 49er fire because it began along 
winding highway 49 apparently was started by a transient igniting 
toilet paper 
firefighters also battled several other fires in northern 
california including a 9000acre blaze near healdsburg about 65 
miles north of san francisco which destroyed three homes several 
outbuildings and briefly threatened a pacific gas amp electric co 
geothermal generating plant it was 75 percent contained

governor of taxachusetts on tuesday and told business executives 
his democratic rival would pay for federal programs by reaching 
right for the wallet and taking their money 
in a separate appearance in missouri farm country bush also

to the soviet union 
we will never go back to the grainembargo days of those 
democrats carter and mondale and who knows who else the 
republican presidential nominee declared dukakis campaign has 
said that improved trade with the soviets should be linked with 
progress on human rights 
bush delivered a breakfast address on economics to the 
executives club in chicago and then flew to jefferson city mo 
for a rally on the state capitol steps 
on a hot sunny day a noontime crowd of thousands of people gave 
bush an enthusiastic welcome dukakis also had his supporters his

the capitols top floor 
later bush flew to los angeles where he attended a 1000 a 
person fundraiser whose audience included hollywood celebrities 
bob hope dina merrill and arnold schwarzenegger 
on the issue of peace my opponents views are simply beyond

leader of the west and it has not i believe occurred to him that 
if america doesnt lead the free countries of the world the free 
countries of the world will not have a leader 
taken together illinois missouri and california command 82 of 
the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house 
in chicago bush told the businessmen the surest way to kill 
the recovery is to raise taxes that will stifle everything from 
investment and personal savings to consumer spending it will clamp 
down on growth 
it will invite a recession he said 
bush promised anew that he would not raise taxes that he would 
fight trade protectionism and that he would attack the budget 
deficit with a flexible freeze on government spending 
he did not spell out which programs would be cut and which would

republican george bush is raising the specter 
of a democraticimposed grain embargo as he seeks to emphasize an 
economic policy chasm between himself and presidential opponent 
michael dukakis 
in a pair of campaign stops tuesday in missouri bush told 
supporters he wants to expand american markets abroad saying 
american farmers and ranchers can compete with anyone anywhere in 
the world if the rules are fair 
the democrats he contended are interested only in production 
controls and want to control the lives of the farmers 
harking back to the grain embargo imposed by president jimmy 
carter on us exports to the soviet union bush said i will not 
use food as a foreign policy weapon 
he cited a july 27 article in the journal of commerce that said 
a dukakis aide suggested the massachusetts governor might 
reexamine the us policy of selling government subsidized wheat 
to the soviets 
can you imagine another president who would leave open the 
door of using agriculture products to make political points and 
using our producers in that way he said i will not go back to 
this grain embargo listen farmers are still trying to recover 
from that 
today bush was courting the ethnic vote in california with 
hispanic events in los angeles and fresno and a tour of san 
franciscos chinatown following his day of barnstorming in 
illinois and missouri 
in los angeles on tuesday night bush was feted at a gala 
fundraiser for the republican partys victory 88 fund hosted 
by california gov george deukmejian 
on the issue of peace my opponents views are simply beyond 
the pale bush told the audience he does not i believe see 
america as the leader of the west and it has not i believe 
occurred to him that if america doesnt lead the free countries of 
the world the free countries of the world will not have a leader 
the 1000 a person event drew a host of hollywood celebrities 
including bob hope dina merrill and arnold schwarzeneggar 
bush has been clearly annoyed at allegations that forced the 
resignation of seven members of an ethnic coalition and of his 
choice to run the campaign activities of the republican party bush 
said tuesday he neither asked the eight to stay nor encouraged 
their departure 
in a brief conversation with reporters aboard air force two 
bush refused to say whether he would offer a spot to one of them 
frederic malek in a bush administration 
i have a lot of confidence in fred malek i dont think he has 
one bigoted bone in his body was all he would say when asked 
about maleks future should bush win the election 
bush had named malek to a top position at the republican 
national committee but malek stepped down when it was revealed 
that he had carried out orders from thenpresident richard nixon to 
compile a list of jews among the top officials of the bureau of 
labor statistics 
as to the reports of alleged antisemitic and fascist ties by 
members of his american nationalities coalition he said 
i dont like the allegations about people and i dont like it 
being injected into the campaign 
asked why he did not urge them to stay in light of that 
viewpoint he told the reporters because then youd be talking 
about this all the time all the time for the next two months 
obscuring these other questions were talking about defense 
economic policy thats why 
bush made the comments before his plane lifted off for los 
angeles from the missouri trip 
at a colorful rally at the jefferson city state capitol bush 
promised to give farmers expanded foreign markets 
agricultural america can compete any place in the world so 
long as we give them access to other peoples markets he said 
he painted a rosy economic picture under the reagan years 
promised to strengthen and broaden our economic growth and 
said the family right in the middle is earning 4000 more a year 
than he would have under those tired democratic policies 
bush on tuesday also announced a team of agricultural campaign 
advisers including sen bob dole rkan agriculture secretary 
richard lyng us trade representative clayton yeutter and former 
american farm bureau president robert delano

a chance to succeed retiring sen william proxmire and milwaukee 
bucks owner herbert kohl won his first bid for public office 
defeating former gov anthony s earl in a fourway democratic 
senate primary 
i am very honored to be chosen as the republican nominee for 
the united states senate engeleiter said after becoming the only 
woman nominated to the us senate by a major party in 1988 
i believe there are major differences between me and herb 
kohl she said i am an average member of an average wisconsin 
family i understand the concerns of the people out there 
kohl the millionaire owner of the national basketball 
association franchise easily defeated earl who lost a bid for 
reelection in 1986 as well as former deputy attorney general 
edward r garvey and secretary of state douglas la follette 
kohl said voters wanted a qualified nonpolitician with real 
businessworld experience and they said they want a senator wholl 
be independent of special interests 
earl who criticized kohls extensive use of television ads 
during the campaign said i dont think herb kohl would mind if 
i say he got the most votes but i got the best votes 
with 3195 of 3450 precincts or 93 percent reporting kohl 
had 244085 votes or 47 percent earl had 199112 or 38 percent

us senator from wisconsin this fall and that senator has to be 
susan engeleiter he said 
democratic rep jim moody won the nomination for a fourth term 
from the 5th district moody announced earlier this year he was

the scramble for democratic nomination for the seat held for 31 
years by proxmire 72 was triggered by his surprise announcement 
last year that he would not seek reelection 
id be 79 before the end of my next term proxmire explained 
to disappointed democrats 
ironically campaign spending became a major issue among 
democratic contenders for the right to succeed proxmire a 
gregarious handshaker whose lowbudget reelection campaigns and 
congressional budgetcutting efforts in won widespread popularity 
kohl 53 a former chain store owner who was making his first 
bid for public office outspent his three opponents combined more 
than 2 million to approximately 431000 by earl 360000 by 
garvey and 15500 by la follette as of aug 24 election board 
records showed 
politics should be people ideas and leadership not 
multimilliondollar tv hype said la follette who said his 
lowbudget campaigns more closely resembled those by the 
indefatigible proxmire 
when he easily won reelection six years ago proxmire spent 
14510 he said some of it for postage to return contributions 
like the 52yearold earl garvey 48 sought to bounce back 
from a 1986 defeat although an underdog garvey former executive 
director of the national footbal league players association came 
close to upsetting republican sen robert w kasten two years ago 
la follette 48 a threeterm secretary of state and former 
state senator from kenosha lost a 1978 bid for lieutenant governor 
in the gop race king 47 a former fbi agent and onetime

sen dan quayle is not exactly a 
standup comic but with some punchy oneliners the republican vice 
presidential nominee is getting his licks in against michael 
dukakis positions on defense 
until recently quayles message was obscured by questions about 
his own military posture and it was no laughing matter for his 
campaign but aides were delighted tuesday at the attention quayle 
got when he delivered some wicked lines that ridiculed the 
democratic presidential nominee and provoked the dukakis camp into 
saying that the young indiana senator was merely acting his age 
nearly a month ago with his vice presidential campaign only 
hours old quayle was mired in questions about whether his hawkish 
image jibed with another image of him as a draft dodger 
on tuesday quayle was the gop tickets attack man portraying 
dukakis as weak on defense and inexperienced in foreign policy 
matters 
want to hear a sad story about the dukakis campaign quayle 
told supporters in a milwaukee suburb 
the governor of massachusetts he lost his top naval adviser 
last week his rubber duck drowned in his bathtub quayle said 
as the audience roared 
later in bismarck nd quayle joked that the massachusetts 
governors experience in foreign policy was limited to dealing with 
the governor of neighboring new hampshire 
the jokes got newspaper ink and even some time on the network 
news quayles campaign was pleased 
people are now seeing an articulate humorous individual who 
has used his time in the senate and the house to be an expert on 
defense foreign policy and national security issues said david 
prosperi quayles spokesman 
campaign strategists have long touted quayles defense expertise 
as one of his assets he has been a member of the senate armed 
services committee for eight years and has been deeply involved in 
nato issues among others 
but getting that message out has been difficult 
a speech last week in chicago for example was supposed to be a 
major display of quayles stuff as prosperi put it 
but quayle tossed out the text preferring to speak from 
notecards and ended up making a confusing statement about offensive 
and defensive weapons and evoking novelist tom clancy on 
antisatellite testing 
quayles opposition to legislation to make the veterans 
administration a cabinetlevel department also became a distracting 
issue some saw the vote as antiveteran 
that together with allegations he pulled strings to get into 
the national guard during the vietnam war dogged quayle almost from 
the moment he left new orleans as george bushs running mate 
a hawkish conservative in congress quayle denied using his 
wealthy familys influence 20 years ago to avoid combat and 
indignantly defended as honorable and patriotic his guard service 
throughout the first weeks of his campaign quayle found himself 
repeating no rules were broken to reporters who questioned him 
at almost every stop 
that has not happened for some time although quayle also has 
not held a news conference since sept 1 
aides say they believe he may have succeeded in finally getting 
the debate focused on the issues not his past 
its a continuation of our strategy that now is starting to 
get a lot more attention because all the diversions basically have 
blown away prosperi said 
the strategy is to portray dukakis as dangerously naive on 
defense matters blasting his opposition to the mx and midgetman 
weapons 
quayle on tuesday described the democratic nominee as the most 
antidefense candidate on a national level since george mcgovern 
he said it was shocking that dukakis had found it necessary 
to receive defense briefings over the weekend from members of 
congress 
you dont learn what you need to know about the national 
security of our nation in one weekend cram course quayle said 
he was cheered by the heartily supportive audiences on this 
midwestern swing the only discordant note came from a group of 
disgruntled veterans at a rally in grand junction colo for them 
at least the veterans were still an issue 
what about veterans benefits one asked as quayle made his 
way shaking hands 
replied quayle im for them

a federal judge approved nearly all of an 
875 million jury award to a woman whose lawsuit against gd 
searle amp co said the manufacturers copper7 intrauterine device 
left her sterile 
however in his ruling tuesday us district judge robert renner 
lowered the award to esther kociemba for emotional distress from 1 
million to 400000 based on state law limiting such awards to the 
lower figure 
renner upheld a 7 million punitive damage award and a 750000 
damage award for pain and suffering 
in its verdict friday the jury found that the copper7 was not 
properly tested that searle failed to warn about risks connected 
with the birthcontrol device and that the company intentionally 
misrepresented the iud 
the jury found that searle was not negligent in designing or 
manufacturing the copper7 
searle plans to submit motions oct 4 that the verdict be set 
aside and for a new trial based on evidentiary and other 
errors spokeswoman kay bruno said from company headquarters in 
skokie ill 
searle already said it will appeal the verdict 
roger brosnahan one of kociembas attorneys said the judges 
action was largely pro forma 
it certainly is one more step toward we hope searle 
recognizing the seriousness of the problem brosnahan said we 
hope someone in that company or monsanto searles parent company 
will hear the clear message that the jury and the court has given 
brosnahan said last week that the verdict marked the first time 
a jury awarded punitive damages against searle for a 
copper7related illness and that it was the largest award 
about 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 the most 
widely used iud in the united states before it was withdrawn from 
the us market in january 1986 searle won 14 of the previous 17 
cases to be decided 
mrs kociemba of elk river had sought 15 million in punitive 
damages 15 million to 2 million in compensatory damages and 
300000 in compensatory damages for her husband william the jury 
declined to award him any money

un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar requested that iraq allow a team of specialists to 
investigate claims by the united states and others that baghdad 
used poison gas to crush a kurdish rebellion 
also tuesday secretary of state george shultz said iraq is 
using such chemical weapons against the kurds he said the us 
conclusions were based on a us examination of kurdish refugees 
inside turkey and on other evidence which to me seems to be 
compelling 
i feel our evidence is quite convincing he said but 
were not in a position to make that public 
perez de cuellar conveyed the request of 10 governments for a 
un investigation to iraqs charge daffaires ali mahmoud 
sumaida on tuesday said un spokeswoman nadia younes 
the nations making the request are the united states japan 
britain italy west germany norway sweden denmark finland and 
iceland she said 
iraq has denied it used gas against the minority kurds but has 
previously acknowledged using chemical weapons against iran in 
their nearly 8yearold war that led to a ceasefire last month 
the 1925 geneva protocol bans use of chemical or biological 
weapons although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed as a 
deterrent against attack 
also tuesday a highranking iraqi official acknowledged his 
government is moving many kurds from small villages for security 
reasons or to provide better services but he said it is not trying 
to wipe them out or change their way of life 
kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced iraqs policy of 
demolishing small villages and relocating their population 
but the official nizar hamdoon deputy foreign secretary and 
former iraqi ambassador to the united states said in an interview 
that the government has no intention to change the life of the 
kurds 
asked about reports of widespread relocations he said if 
youre talking about the border area the reasons are mainly 
security reasons so that rebel infiltration stops 
iraq grants its 25 million to 3 million kurdish inhabitants 
who live mainly in the north a form of regional autonomy 
including their own assembly and use of the kurdish language 
rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent 
state an additional 6 million kurds live in turkey iran the 
soviet union and syria 
about 60000 kurds many suffering chemical injuries recently 
fled iraq to turkey and said they did so because of chemical 
attacks the kurds claim iraq used the chemical weapons as part of 
an offensive against the kurds 
an investigating team would need iraqs permission to enter the 
country and failure to cooperate could hurt its international 
standing 
in london the british foreign office said it toughened its 
stand monday partly because of the us state department evidence 
of iraqi chemical attacks on the kurds 
the evidence led the us senate on friday to vote for tough 
economic sanctions against iraq the senate also suggested the 
iraqi relocation of kurdish population was connected with 
genocide against the kurdish people 
the measure still must be approved by the house and signed by 
president reagan

unopposed democratic candidate paul mceachern in the race to 
succeed outgoing gov john sununu 
this is the first act of a twoact american drama gregg 
said as he declared victory just after 9 pm gregg immediately 
launched an offensive against mceachern whom he painted as a 
freespending liberal 
we will show the people of new hampshire what deep 
philosophical differences there are a choice between fiscal 
restraint and liberal spending gregg said 
gregg a fourterm congressman easily outdistanced former 
manchester mayor robert shaw and political neophyte william 
lawrence a qualitycontrol engineer from hollis 
with 266 of 298 precincts reporting gregg had 60234 votes or 
79 percent to 13737 votes for shaw or 18 percent and 2330

gop contest to succeed gregg in the 2nd district 
with 151 of 178 precincts reporting in that district douglas 
led with 47 percent to tamposis 41 percent the remainder was 
split among greggs cousin stephen gregg of holderness state rep 
alf jacobson of new london peterborough magazine editor dennis 
allen and milford restaurateur andrew tempelman 
nashua mayor james donchess defeated former state rep barbara 
underwood for the democratic 2nd district nomination by a 66 
percent to 26 percent margin with lewis du pont smith trailing 
with 8 percent 
city clerks described turnout as dismally low they blamed rain 
and a lack of exciting contests 
</TEXT>

gregg son of a former governor entered the gubernatorial race 
when sununu a national cochairman of george bushs presidential 
campaign decided not to seek a record fourth twoyear term 
mceachern a lawyer campaigned as a staunch opponent of the 
troubled seabrook nuclear power plant in 1986 he ran a fairly 
close race against sununu 
douglas accused tamposi daughter of a millionaire real estate 
developer of using her wealth to try to buy the election tamposi 
initially said she would not bankroll her campaign but ended up 
lending it 150000 
though he stopped short of formally endorsing tamposi sununu 
sent thousands of letters and made television spots for her 
douglas won endorsements from nationally known conservatives 
including sen orrin hatch of utah rep jack kemp of new york and 
sen gordon humphrey of new hampshire 
humphrey created an uproar last week when he said tamposi 
shouldnt run for congress because she has a 22monthold daughter 
to take care of humphrey apologized two days later

iran and iraq agreed to recess their stalled peace 
talks and resume them in new york according to a un mediator 
but baghdad balked at a proposed meeting date this month 
a un mediator said he hoped to come up with a meeting date 
today 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar proposed the 
temporary move to new york in the hope of unblocking the 
unmediated negotiations which opened in geneva almost three 
weeks ago 
the agreement to pick up talks shortly in new york was 
announced tuesday by un mediator jan eliasson appointed by perez 
de cuellar last week to oversee the talks in his absence 
the un chief invited the foreign ministers of the two nations 
to meet at un headquarters in new york on sept 22 but the iraqi 
delegation announced that foreign minister tariq aziz could not be 
in new york before the first week of october 
the iraqis also said they agreed to attend one meeting in new 
york only if before leaving geneva a firm date was fixed for 
returning 
the iraqis hardline stance was spelled out in a press statement 
tuesday night 
eliasson sought to play down the problem calling the question 
of dates a technical secondary issue he told journalists it 
could be solved in a smooth undramatic manner and indicated he 
hoped this could be done by today 
the main thing is the acceptance by both sides of a meeting 
in new york shortly and of the subsequent continuation of the 
talks in geneva he said 
he told a news conference earlier that both sides seem 
committed to keep the peace process going he said they also 
pledged to continue to observe the ceasefire which went into 
effect aug 20 after eight years of fighting and an estimated 1 
million dead 
the swedish diplomat acknowledged however that on issues of 
substance there has been little if any progress 
but he said the essential thing was that the peace process is 
kept alive 
the talks have bogged down over differing priorities iran wants 
the negotiations to stick to the un ceasefire resolution 
starting with withdrawal of all troops to internationally 
recognized borders 
iran holds that these borders were delineated in a 1975 treaty 
between the two countries iraq renounced the accord in 1980 
shortly before invading iran but iran says the unilateral 
repudiation violates international law 
iraq wants the talks to focus immediately on clearing the 
shattalarab waterway of silt and sunken wreckage the waterway 
provides iraq with its main outlet to the sea 
iraq also wants immediately to discuss freedom of navigation in 
the persian gulf 
iran says these are secondary issues that could be dealt with 
after the ceasefire resolution is put into full effect

house speaker joe lane was in a tight battle with 
two backers of former gov evan mecham in early returns tuesday 
from a primary election that the ousted governor vowed would be a 
revolutionary step at the ballot box 
lane lloyd fenn and warren shumaker were virtually deadlocked 
with 26 of 58 precincts reporting a fourth candidate gerald 
patton trailed with 14 percent 
if i lose tonight its mecham that did it lane said 
tuesday but i dont think itll happen i think ill win all 
right it might not be an easy one 
mecham who predicted monday that lane would lose either the 
primary or general election said tuesday night i think well be 
in for some surprises probably before the night is over when its 
over there will be quite a number of changes nobody will get 
everything they want 
in other returns senate president carl kunasek was running 
ahead of jerry gillespie an ultraconservative mecham backer but 
some other senators who voted to oust mecham were running behind 
i think this is going to be the demise of the mecham gang 
myself lane who represents a district in southeastern arizona 
had predicted monday but i wouldnt bet any money on it because 
ive been surprised once before by the mecham folks 
kunasek said monday he was optimistic but added at times i 
get very depressed im just resigned to whatever fate they the 
voters produce 
the mecham supporters were banking on voter dissatisfaction over 
the former governors april 4 senate impeachment conviction and an 
electionyear tax hike approved by the gopdominated legislature to 
meet a massive budget deficit 
mecham predicted friday that lane would be defeated and said 
i think well see a bigger change than weve ever seen before 
i think that is a revolutionary step at the ballot box 
one promecham candidate was his former press secretary ron 
bellus who ran against former senate president leo corbet in 
northcentral phoenix bellus said he did not know what a 
mechamite was adding that he represented new ideas and that 
corbet was a good old boy of arizona politics early returns 
showed corbet with a 21 lead over bellus 
sen john hays a rural lawmaker who voted to oust mecham was 
running ahead of promecham challenger shirley macnoye gop sens 
bill delong and doug todd who also voted to convict the former 
governor also had early leads 
but sen peter kay of phoenix and sen jack taylor of mesa both 
of whom voted to oust the governor were running behind their 
rivals in early returns 
also on tuesdays ballot were two congressional races 
in district 1 in eastern maricopa county democrat john fillmore 
defeated rival thane read for the right to challenge firstterm 
republican jay rhodes in november with 325 of 417 precincts or 78

george bush has capitalized on the pledge of 
allegiance and national defense as presidential campaign issues 
scoring enough points to pull ahead of michael dukakis in two 
public opinion polls 
dukakis suffered his highest negative rating of the race in one 
of the surveys released tuesday while in the other bush was 
favored by sizable margins on the issues he has been pressing most 
strongly in the race 
bush led by eight points 47 percent to 39 percent in a cbs 
newsnew york times poll and 49 percent to 41 percent in a gallup 
poll two polls monday had it closer but two surveys last week 
also put bush ahead and found underlying movement toward him 
a los angeles times nationwide poll released today showed a dead 
heat with bush and dukakis both receiving 47 percent support among 
the most likely voters among all registered voters who were 
surveyed by the newspaper 54 percent identified bush as the 
candidate who would best ensure a strong defense 
in the gallup poll 68 percent had heard of bushs criticism of 
dukakis for vetoing a law requiring teachers to lead classes in the 
pledge and nearly half of them viewed dukakis less favorably 
because of it the rest split between rating him higher and saying 
it made no difference 
dukakis the massachusetts governor has said he acted on the 
basis of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional but in 
the cbstimes poll 70 percent said teachers should be required to 
lead the pledge and half of them said they felt that way even if 
the requirement were unconstitutional 
bush also did well on defense twentyeight percent said he 
would make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said weaker by 
contrast 39 percent said dukakis would make us defenses weaker 
and just 13 percent said stronger the rest in both cases said 
defenses would remain unchanged 
bush even outpolled dukakis on competence an issue the 
democrat had sought to make his own fiftyone percent said bush 
would be more competent at managing the federal government while 
32 percent chose dukakis 
the cbstimes poll also found bush ranked nearly even with 
dukakis on protecting the environment an issue that traditionally 
goes to the democrats but that bush has been stressing recently 
forty percent in the gallup poll viewed dukakis unfavorably 
overall up from 32 percent last month and the highest all year for 
dukakis in the poll dukakis was rated favorably by 53 percent but 
bush won both ratings with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent 
unfavorable 
both candidates confidence ratings declined in the cbstimes 
poll fiftynine percent said they would be uneasy with dukakis in 
an international crisis up from 53 percent last month fortyseven 
percent said they would be uneasy with bush up 10 points 
bush scored worse than dukakis on helping the middle class 
losing that rating 3347 and sen dan quayle of indiana did poorly 
as bushs running mate just 32 percent said quayle was qualified 
to be president while 58 percent said they would worry about him 
stepping in if it were necessary 
the cbstimes poll was conducted among 1043 probable voters 
from thursday through sunday and had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points the gallup poll was done friday through 
sunday among 1003 registered voters and was given a 4point margin 
of error 
the los angeles times poll was conducted among 1105 registered 
voters from friday through sunday and included 656 voters described 
as most likely to vote the margin of error was 4 percentage points

associated press photographer chris omeara 
traveled to jamaica with us fire and other relief workers tuesday 
as the island nation struggled to recover from hurricane gilberts 
devastation omeara spent 45 minutes tuesday photographing areas 
near the airport the following is his description 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the place was pretty hard hit from the 
look of things from the air 
coming over the western part of the island you could see the 
trees were down almost like dominoes it was like a tornado went 
ripping through there 
before we landed they let two people hang with harnesses out of 
the plane to get pictures of the island the red cross people and 
the foreign relief people said they were going to use the footage 
to show how bad the island was really hit 
we finally landed and there were probably about 12 or 15 
policemen and soldiers and some other people there to help out the 
fire department 
there was debris thrown up against the buildings and strewn 
everywhere ventilation ducts baggage carts a couple of big 
hangars had their roofs bent back the terminal was flooded 
there seemed to be a lot of flooding in the streets still it 
was still raining when we were there 
nobody was mentioning any casualties but they were saying 
things like if you think this is bad you should see the rest of 
island 
it was getting dark when we left you couldnt see any lights 
the island was totally dark and so was the airport there are no 
landing lights at all it looks very strange at night 
the people seemed really happy to see the fire department they 
really need a lot there theres no water electricty or phones 
right now and no ones really sure when they will be restored 
before we left one woman was pleading with us not to make it 
look so bad because of the tourist industry 
we took back two teenage boys to miami they both seemed pretty 
excited about going through a hurricane

china will sharply limit its loans of giant 
pandas for foreign exhibit in an effort to halt commercial 
exploitation of the rare animals a forestry ministry official said 
today 
the official xinhua news agency meanwhile reported that all 
loans of pandas and snubnosed monkeys to the united states were 
being suspended so as to protect the endangered species 
china the only country where pandas live in the wild estimates 
that fewer than 1000 remain threatened by poachers and 
deforestation 
however zhang yushan of the forestry ministry which has charge 
of conservation said the new policy affects all countries not 
just the united states and does not completely rule out future 
loans 
its not that pandas absolutely cant go he said in a 
telephone interview its just that such exhibits should be 
controlled 
zhang said if a foreign leader requests a panda loan top 
chinese leaders may agree to enhance bilateral ties however he 
declined to say under what other conditions pandas might be 
released for exhibit abroad 
we believe the fewer the better and no exhibits at all would 
be best he said china has been sending about four pairs of 
pandas abroad each year with foreign zoos competing fiercely for 
the animals 
other officials contacted at the forestry ministry also refused 
to spell out what the new policy would mean in practice or how it 
would affect any such loans already approved 
regardless of how china will implement the new policy its 
effect on us zoos is moot 
in june the us fish and wildlife service suspended its 
issuance of import licenses for pandas scuttling planned exhibits 
in atlanta and at the michigan state fair china had approved both 
loans 
the us agency said it wanted to consider objections by 
american conservation groups that the loans exploit pandas for 
profit and interrupt efforts to breed them in china 
china stopped giving gift pandas to foreign zoos in the 1970s 
but requests for loans of pandas for temporary exhibits abroad have 
multiplied in recent years 
six us zoos as well as zoos in belgium australia and japan 
have received separate pairs of loan pandas many more have asked 
using banquet diplomacy and highranking connections in an effort 
to win chinese approval 
zoos receiving loan pandas generally pay china 300000 to 
500000 but often take in much more than that in increased ticket 
sales prompting both the chinese and the foreign zoos to accuse 
each other of profiteering from the pandas 
foreign zoos often make a lot of money zhang said were 
not saying they shouldnt make money but there should be some 
other reason for the exhibit

the 292000voter turnout was about 10 percent of the states 31 
million eligible voters apparently the lowest since the state 
began keepinr records in 1950

15927 votes or 9 percent 
humphrey a former state senator and minnesotas attorney 
general since 1983 said his primary victory lets us go forward 
directly again tomorrow 
i expect polling to go up and down a little more and its 
going to close in very soon and its going to be a horse race and 
im going to win he said i like winning elections 
humphrey has trailed durenberger by up to 19 percentage points 
in public opinion polls although no independent polls have been 
released recently he also has trailed durenberger by a 21 margin 
in fundraising 
durenberger expects to spend 65 million in his reelection 
bid while the humphrey campaign plans to spend 35 million to 4 
million 
the names of four other us senate candidates will appear on

jordans king hussein paved the way 
for the creation of an independent palestinian state when he 
severed ties with the occupied west bank plo chief yasser arafat 
said 
we are at a crucial stage arafat said in a speech tuesday 
to the european parliament the palestinian state the key to 
peace security and development in the arab region is in the 
offing 
arafat is likely to discuss creation of a palestinian state in 
meetings today the final day of a twoday visit with the greek 
and french foreign ministers 
the palestine liberation organization chief told socialist 
parliament members that the palestine national council a kind of 
parliamentinexile would decide on a palestinian state on the 
west bank the palestinian council is to meet next month in tunisia 
the only option left is the right realistic and irreplaceable 
one namely the palestinian option the essence of which is the 
independent palestinian state arafat said at a closeddoor 
meeting with the european parliaments 165strong socialist group 
the largest in the 518member assembly 
this state will have a republican democratic and multiparty 
system it will abide by the universal declaration of human rights 
and will not discriminate among its citizens on the basis of color 
race or religion arafat said 
a test of his speech was released to reporters 
arafat said the plo should represent the palestinian people at 
an international peace conference israel has rejected the idea and 
refuses to talk to the plo which it views as a terrorist group 
it would be possible at the said conference and through the 
negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss 
and agree on arrangements for international guarantees of peace 
among all states of the region including the independent 
palestinian state arafat stated 
of king husseins decision july 31 to relinquish sovereignty 
over the west bank arafat said 
the measures ended the european american and israeli debate 
on palestinian representation at the international conference no 
one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share with the 
plo the representation of the palestinian people 
the plo is seeking to form a provisional government or a 
governmentinexile for the west bank and gaza strip where more 
than 15 million palestinians live 
the territories captured from jordan and egypt during the 1967 
middle east war have been the scene of a palestinian uprising 
since last dec 8 in which more than 260 palestinians and six 
israelis have died 
richard balfe a british laborite who attended the session with 
arafat said the plo leader spoke in arabic for about 40 minutes 
then fielded questions for another half hour 
he said arafat made it fairly clear that the recognition of 
israel was part of the negotiation at an international peace 
conference 
lord plumb the parliament president met for 20 minutes with 
arafat before the meeting 
he told reporters his message to the plo leader was get out of 
violence get into negotiations and added he sensed arafat was 
in strasbourg to move toward condemnation of violence 
but in jerusalem avi pazner spokesman for prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said arafats address contained nothing new 
it sounds like a rehashing of all his arafats ideas the 
main thing being that he still wants the disappearance of the state 
of israel thats the crux of it i dont see anything new 
pazner said

bring viewers up to date and resume live coverage of the olympics 
there is no more important news story than selecting the 40th 
president of the united states and there is no more important 
event than staging the 24th olympiad what to do nbc has a rare 
opportunity to provide our viewers both the debate and the 
olympics we shall do just that said wright 
nbc news president michael gartner said the change was an 8 
million question potential revenue loss of 8 million bucks we 
just decided that this was a terrible dilemma and we would do our 
best to try and cover both

antiapartheid group in the country a loose coalition of about 700 
labor civic church and educational groups which up to 25 
million members most of the estimated 30000 people detained for 
varying periods since the 1986 emergency declaration have been

at the same time the congressional general accounting office 
said it would be premature for congress to approve the energy 
departments request to pass legislation needed to launch the 700 
million project 
there are many uncertainties involving wipp performance that 
must be addressed before doe can demonstrate that the facility is 
suitable gaos keith fultz said 
synar called the hearing to look into the departments plan to 
place 125000 barrels of socalled transuranic waste into the 
repository 2150 feet below the ground near carlsbad 
transuranic waste a byproduct of nuclear weapons production is 
a combination of radioactive material and a wide variety of 
hazardous substances the waste proposed for wipp represents 
approximately half the amount now stored above ground in about half 
a dozen states 
synar said energy officials should go home and do your 
homework and then come back and ask us for the legislation dont 
put the cart before the horse were one month away from this 
targeted waste loading and you cant justify this loading 
jill lytle deputy assistant energy secretary for nuclear 
materials told synar the agency plans to follow environmental laws 
governing the disposal of dangerous waste during a fiveyear test 
of the wipp facility 
wipp will not endanger the safety and health of the public 
she testified 
a department spokesman said in an interview tuesday night that 
the repository is ready to begin receiving waste perhaps by the 
beginning the year but for four obstacles in the way he said no 
date has been set however 
we wont have an opening date until we have the resolution of 
those four items i think its too strong to say the opening has 
been postponed indefinitely were actively pursuing the opening of 
wipp said spokesman richard marquez 
he said nuclear waste containers must be tested a fiveyear 
plan for use of the facility and a site readiness review must be 
performed before an opening date can be set congress must also 
pass a bill withdrawing the wipp land from public and mining uses 
but in a memo written sept 2 james knight director of the 
energy departments office of safety appraisals said the 
departments final safety analysis report lacks sufficient 
information for us to independently conclude that the facility can 
be operated safely 
in an august letter to knight a brookhaven team that visited 
wipp said facility officials have not addressed issues associated 
with either adequacy of the plants design or the quality 
assurance of the construction phase 
lokesh chaturvedi the consultant said energy officials had not 
given him any data about what might happen to stored waste if the 
facility was breached by a pressurized brine reservoir that appears 
to exist about 800 feet below portions of the wipp site 
chaturvedi deputy director of the environmental evaluation 
group in albuquerque and owen thompson a staff member of the 
office of safety appraisals also questioned the need to even put 
barrels of waste into wipp during the fiveyear test 
the doe describes wipp as a research and development facility 
but we have not been able to receive a final plan of research 
requiring waste emplacement chaturvedi said 
thompson said that because waste barrels are not expected to 
leak during the five years actual repository conditions are not 
being evaluated and actual repository performance will not be 
demonstrated 
the gaos fultz said he has been unable to resolve questions 
about whether wipp officials would be able to retrieve waste that 
leaked from barrels and where any retrieved waste would be stored

two safety consultants sued morton thiokol inc 
claiming they were fired for attempting to inform nasa about 
problems involving solidfuel rocket motors after the destruction 
of space shuttle challenger 
steven agee of renton wash and anthony laine of phoenix filed 
separate suits monday in federal court in chicago seeking 
unspecified damages the suits allege wrongful termination 
defamation and violation of federal racketeering laws 
both men were hired as systemsafety analysts for the booster 
redesign program created after the january 1986 explosion that 
killed challengers seven astronauts the accident was blamed on a 
faulty seal in a booster rocket 
agee 45 worked at the rocket makers plant in utah from 
november 1986 until march 1987 laine started in january 1987 and 
was fired the following month 
agees suit alleges he wrote 221 catastrophic hazard 
analyses or ways that the rockets could fail that morton 
thiokol failed to forward to the national aerospace and space 
administration which contracts with thiokol to build shuttle 
rockets 
agees litigation asserts he was defamed when thiokol falsely 
told another prospective employer the boeing co that he was 
fired because he got into a serious fight with one of his 
supervisors at thiokol 
laine contends he was ordered to cease an investigation of a 
potential hazard in the booster rocket engine and had been told 
that safety engineers were only to cut and paste old reports 
and not investigate any new potential safety problems 
thiokol falsely told nasa that laine was fired for compiling 
classified information that he should not have had thus 
defaming him the lawsuit indicates 
the suits also assert that racketeering laws were violated when 
thiokol used the mails and telephones to file false reports with 
the us securities and exchange commission regarding its 
contractual obligations with nasa 
morton thiokol whose corporate offices are in chicago was 
named as a defendant along with five of the companys utahbased 
managers and phoenixbased arc technical services inc an 
engineering personnel company through which agee and laine were 
paid 
thiokol lawyer darryl lee said tuesday he would have no comment 
because he had not seen the complaints 
lawsuits filed by another former engineer roger boisjoly who 
warned against the launching of the challenger were dismissed last 
month by a federal judge in salt lake city

as hurricane gilberts recordbreaking 
fury sends caribbean islanders scrambling for cover national 
hurricane center director bob sheets remained calm at his helm 
the barometric pressure at the storms center plummeted to 2613 
inches at 558 pm edt tuesday night making gilbert the most 
intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere in terms 
of barometric pressure but sheets handled a mob of reporters with 
ease 
ive flown into 200 hurricanes i really dont think this 
is difficult he said 
with his schedule of interviews timed to the minute sheets 
spent most of tuesday on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters 
beside a large monitor showing the destructive gilbert in full 
color sprawled across much of the western caribbean 
rosycheeked and goodnatured sheets was named acting director 
during the 1987 atlantic hurricane season and became director in 
march 
the transition from former director neil frank widely known for 
his distinctive style and flattop haircut to sheets his dark 
blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a 
gray woolblend jacket has been smooth 
he knows his job very well and hes a calm personality 
vivian jorge the centers budget analyst said of sheets on days 
with especially active tropical weather ms jorge steps in to 
coordinate media interviews 
interest in gilbert has been high since it started packing 
hurricaneforce winds last weekend and by tuesday night became a 
category 5 storm with winds of 175 mph 
a category 5 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength 
has the potential for causing catastrophic damage with winds in 
excess of 155 mph and pressure below 2717 inches 
gilbert has been compared to the labor day hurricane of 1935 
which slammed into the florida keys and killed 408 people and 
hurricane camille which devastated the mississippi coast in 1969 
killing 256 the only other category 5 storms to hit land this 
century the last major hurricane to make landfall was elena in 
1985 along the mississippi alabama and florida panhandle 
the major television networks local stations and print media 
were on hand to monitor the hurricane 
the centers 33member crew including seven hurricane 
forecasters and specialists are keeping a close watch on the 
hurricane in a large open roomful of blue monitors flickering with 
graphics 
and while sheets might appear to spend most of his day with tiny 
microphones snaking down his back and fielding media questions he 
also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three 
hours and makes hurricane forecasts 
dealing with a major hurricane isnt much different from dealing 
with smaller ones or tropical storms sheets said adding that 
gilbert has been particularly wellbehaved 
it does what we think its going to do he said you feel 
a lot more confident about what youre doing than with weaker 
systems 
his previous experience with hurricanes has served him well in 
keeping off the pressure during these sometimes 18hour days 
ive done this for 25 years so at one stage youre prepared to 
do it or not i dont feel a lot of pressure said sheets 
while eating lunch 
sheets said he remains in touch with his predecessor frank but 
didnt get any special advice from his friend on dealing with his 
highvisibility post at the hurricane center here 
whats frank now a television forecaster for texas station 
khoutv doing now 
hes getting geared up in houston said sheets with a smile

a mother and her three sons have been sentenced 
to life in separate prisons for murdering three police officers 
during a standoff at a motel 
judge richard p hathaway on tuesday said he wished he could 
have imposed the death penalty on alberta easter and her sons 
george roy and william lemons 
firstdegree murder carries an automatic sentence of life 
without parole the death penalty is forbidden under michigans 
constitution 
the judge sentenced the four to solitary confinement in separate 
prisons 
in this way the defendants will understand the pain of 
separation that the victims families feel he said his voice 
breaking in emotion and fading to a whisper 
the actions on july 9 are a disgrace to the word family i 
only wish the victims families could step forward and sentence the 
defendants instead of the court 
easter and her sons were convicted last month of murdering 
inkster sgt ira parker and officers clay hoover and daniel dubiel 
during an 11hour siege in 1987 the trial lasted 14 weeks

suburb to serve a badcheck warrant on easter and were taken 
hostage when the four surrendered the officers were found dead of 
multiple gunshot wounds 
easter and her sons maintained their innocence tuesday 
our blood is on your hands you pray for us and our lives

i am sorry about the loss but it wasnt our fault injustice

west german rudolf cordes home after 
20 months of captivity in the hands of proiranian kidnappers in 
beirut was flown to an undisclosed location to rest and enjoy a 
reunion with his wife and two sons 
reporters were given no chance to talk to the 55yearold 
frankfurt businessman upon his arrival at colognebonn airport 
tuesday night 
west german officials including foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher have denied making any payments for cordes freedom he 
was released by his proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers late 
monday night 
but the masscirculation bild newspaper of hamburg said a sum 
of millions is believed to have been paid to kidnappers for the 
release bild cited unidentified security sources 
the newspaper also quoted a source identified only as a 
security expert as saying that at least 40 million marks 222 
million were paid for cordes release bild is known to have good 
sources within the government 
a highranking government official described cordes long 
captivity the isolation he endured and his constant uncertainty 
over his fate 
the los angeles times said today iran apparently arranged for 
cordes to be transferred from captors linked to mohammed ali 
hamadi who is being tried in germany for hijacking a twa jet to 
the group that freed the west german 
iran apparently arranged the release to regain favor with west 
germany a vital trading partner and the western nation with which 
it has the closest ties the times said citing unidentified 
sources 
cordes was abducted in west beirut in january 1987 three days 
before a west german engineer alfred schmidt was kidnapped 
schmidt was freed sept 7 1987 the hamadi clan was believed to 
have abducted both men 
cordes and his wife marlene touched down at 1020 pm aboard 
a twinengine west german military jet after a fivehour flight 
from syria 
the federal minister for chancellery affairs wolfgang 
schaeuble was aboard the same plane 
schaeuble later told west german television that cordes was 
feeling better than he had expected 
but naturally hes very weak hes probably feeling better now 
because of the initial excitement than he will be tomorrow or the 
day after tomorrow the official said 
hes been flown to a place where he can find privacy for a 
time he desperately needs quiet to recover to work through the 
experience 
i dont know where hes going and even if i knew i wouldnt 
say the official said 
schaeuble said cordes told him his kidnappers treated him 
humanely but the conditions were hard he was always isolated and 
was always chained 
hans neusel a state secretary in the federal interior ministry 
told reporters at the airport cordes said there were signs he was 
about to be released before it happened 
his hopes increased when he was given new clothes three days 
before he was freed said neusel who also was on the plane with 
cordes 
schaeuble said cordes could not identify the kidnappers because 
they wore masks in his presence 
the minister who headed the governments middle east crisis 
staff reiterated earlier government statements that no deals were 
made for cordes release 
cordes beirut manager for the hoechst ag pharmaceutical 
company was freed in beirut at midnight monday by shiite moslem 
extremists syrian officers escorted him to damascus after his 
release 
cordes was the last west german hostage in lebanon where 17 
other foreigners are still missing and believed held captive the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was kidnapped on march 16 1985 
cordes captors a group calling itself the holy warriors for 
freedom said in a statement monday that they were freeing him in 
response to iranian and syrian intervention 
the kidnappers also said his release was linked to hamadi a 
lebanese shiite on trial in west germany for a 1985 twa jetliner 
hijacking and the shooting death of us navy diver robert stethem 
hamadis older brother abbas is serving a 13year prison 
sentence in frankfurt he was convicted in april of complicity in 
kidnapping cordes and schmidt in an effort to force west germany to 
free mohammed hamadi

the city school board president has been fired 
for feeding false information to board members in an effort to 
track down leaks to the news media 
mayor kurt schmoke on tuesday removed meldon s hollis jr 
saying hollis credibility had been undermined but asked him to 
remain a board member because he has good ideas 
hollis was expected to announce today whether he would accept 
the position the board president said tuesday he would resign if 
the mayor asked 
schmoke called hollis actions a terrible mistake in 
judgment 
my view is that the public can tolerate an official being 
wrong on an issue schmoke said what people generally find 
intolerable is an official lying to them 
in taperecorded remarks monday to a political club hollis said 
he leaked false information to board members to see if they were 
lying to me 
i know whos doing the lying he said i know who it is i 
feed them the lies then they run out and lie to the press 
members of the school board tell you they are not 
reporting things to the press and every time you say something 
to em it shows up in the press only with a spin thats far 
from accurate he said then i think that you just do what you 
have to do you tell them things just to see how its reported in 
the press then that way you can tell whos reporting it to the 
press 
hollis said tuesday he gave out three versions of how candidates 
for school superintendent would be interviewed 
i felt justified in taking extraordinary measures he said 
hollis said leaks were undermining the selection process because 
some candidates threatened to withdraw if their candidacies were 
made public 
hollis said he had not deliberately misled any board members 
on anything substantial and that the story was essentially 
true 
board member edward j gutman said i think theres something 
wrong with the man the whole thing is getting uglier and uglier 
we are trustees with the most important responsibility in the 
city 
schmoke who took office in december and declared that education 
would be his first priority named hollis board president in his 
first week the mayor replaced hollis with joseph lee smith 51 a 
board member since 1979

pope john paul ii who had 
planned to bypass south africa on his tour of the region landed in 
johannesburg today after bad weather and mechanical trouble 
diverted his flight to lesotho 
in maseru lesotho meanwhile security forces surrounded a bus 
filled with nuns and schoolgirls that was hijacked by armed 
guerrillas as it headed for a mass to be celebrated by john paul 
a nun today said some of the 71 captives had been released but 
she did not know how many 
official lesotho radio said a group of fanatics had taken 
over the bus tuesday diplomats said the guerrillas were believed 
to be members of the rebel lesotho liberation army 
the pope was informed of the hijacking but made no comment 
arriving in johnannesburg the pope an outspoken critic of 
south africas racial segregation policies did not kiss the 
ground as he customarily does the first time he visits a country 
the pope who is on a 10day tour of southern africa spent 
three hours at johannesburgs jan smuts airport before he and his 
entourage left for lesotho in a convoy of cars and buses 
the 270mile trip to lesotho a mountain kingdom completely 
surrounded by south africa was expected to take at least five 
hours 
foreign minister rf botha greeted the pope on the steps 
leading from the plane and accompanied him into a vip lounge at the 
airport while security forces stood guard inside and outside the 
terminal 
we consider it a privilege to assist the holy father said 
botha who ordered 100 luncheons for the entourage 
the planes pilot robin cartwright told reporters he decided 
to divert the chartered air zimbabwe boeing 707 flight because of a 
low cloud ceiling and because two radio beacons at the airport in 
masera lesothos capital were out of order 
in an announcement to passengers the pilot said conditions had 
been unsuitable to bring the plane below the clouds masera airport 
is in a valley between 30004000foothigh mountains 
a hard freezing rain fell on lesotho king moshoeshoe ii and 
other officials waited at the airport for hours before the 
announcement that the pope would come by road 
lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10day trip that has taken 
the pontiff to zimbabwe and botswana he also plans stops in 
swaziland and mozambique 
the vatican said south africas catholic bishops have advised 
john paul that this was not an appropriate time for him to visit 
south africa 
the pope has said he would like to visit south africa at some 
point but the country was not mentioned when the vatican announced 
this week that john paul would go to tanzania and madagascar on 
another african tour next year 
hundreds of thousands of south africans had been expected to 
cross into lesotho to see the pope during his scheduled 48hour 
visit to the kingdom 
south africas catholic bishops have been active in the 
antiapartheid movement particularly in the period since 17 major 
black opposition groups were banned in february 
the government has blamed the bishops for the popes decision to 
omit south africa from his official itinerary and progovernment 
media have claimed many catholics are angry at their leaders 
progovernment media also tried to depict the pope as having 
repudiated anglican archbishop desmond tutu south africas 
bestknown antiapartheid cleric 
this interpretation was based on the popes unqualified 
denunication of political violence and reservations about sanctions 
and election boycotts tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a 
boycott of upcoming segregated municipal elections 
tutu has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understands 
how some south african blacks feel they have no other alternative 
in seeking to end whiteminority domination 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs and its 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
tutus spokesman john allen said there are no fundamental 
differences between the pope and the anglican archbishop who met 
earlier this year at the vatican

boston police are switching to semiautomatic 
handguns joining other big city police departments trying to match 
the firepower of drug dealers and other criminals 
police commissioner francis m roache announced monday that 9mm 
handguns will replace 38caliber revolvers as standardissue 
weapons for the force 
the bottom line is the average police officer is going to be 
safer and feel safer because of these guns said robert t 
guiney president of the union that represents bostons 1400 
patrol officers 
the 9mm handgun fires more accurately reloads more quickly and 
carries more bullets police said 
semiautomatic weapons were issued two years ago in miami los 
angeles police will begin providing them in february and they are 
under review in dallas and chicago 
police in washington dc were armed this year with 9mm 
semiautomatic weapons because of a murder rate double that of last 
year detroit police and new york citys still use revolvers as 
their primary weapons 
were being outgunned officer harry davis of the los 
angeles police said tuesday about the decision to use beretta 
semiautomatic guns next year the criminals the drug dealers 
have more firepower than the police 
bostons police department the largest in new england with 
1900 members joins the 1200member massachusetts state police in 
switching to the 9mm 
the 650member metropolitan police department is making the 
switch and 50 smaller departments in massachusetts already carry 
the weapon 
its the wave said gary f egan executive director of the 
massachusetts criminal justice training council its gradually 
becoming as standard as the 38caliber revolver once was 
the switch has been quicker among the nations smaller police 
and sheriffs departments the majority of the nations 19000 law 
enforcement agencies smaller departments can make the change more 
quickly and cheaply 
the average 9mm pistol costs about 400 the 38caliber carries 
only one shot in each of six chambers which must be loaded 
individually semiautomatic pistols are loaded by inserting a 12to 
17round magazine into the handle 
youre talking the difference of between 12 seconds to reload 
a 38 under the best of conditions and 2 seconds for a 
9millimeter said guiney 
boston officials said it could take more than a year to complete 
the switch the city must seek bids select a manufacturer and 
train officers to use the weapon

the captain of delta flight 1141 does not hold the 
missing puzzle piece that could explain why the plane crashed a 
federal official says 
lee dickinson jr a member the national transportation safety 
board said larry davis does not know why this plane crashed 
davis one of 94 survivors from the aug 31 crash at dallasfort 
worth international airport that killed 14 people was released 
from parkland memorial on tuesday after talking to ntsb 
investigators about two hours 
the captain was treated for back and facial injuries 
dickinson who briefed the news media by telephone from 
washington on tuesday said that davis seemed to have sharp 
recollections of much of the flight but could not help explain why 
the plane lost engine power and crashed 
the captain told investigators that the flight from jackson 
miss to dallas had been uneventful and that everything seemed 
normal again as he waited on the dallasfort worth taxiway to leave 
for salt lake city 
when the plane took off everything seemed normal until it 
climbed into the air davis told investigators davis heard two 
loud bangs or explosions but no warning beforehand 
he previously experienced compressor stalls but nothing like 
this dickinson said 
davis who is on medication but has been taken off morphine 
told investigators he went to full power and simply tried to keep 
the airplane in the air 
one of the last things davis recalled was that he had failed to 
pull the plane out of trouble dickinson said he realized they 
were not going to make it the investigator said 
investigators had hoped davis might be able to tell them if the 
planes flaps had been set correctly but he could only tell them 
that he remembered they were approved when the crew went through 
the preflight checklist dickinson said 
were still very concerned about the position of the flaps 
dickinson said 
one inconsistency the ntsb had been trying to clear up has been 
that the cockpit recording captured the crew saying the flaps were 
in position for takeoff but the wreckage showed the flaps in the 
wrong position 
he said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap 
handle dickinson said

interior secretary donald hodel said today the 
governments let burn forest fire policy proven inadequate in 
the face of this summers extraordinarily dry conditions will be 
revised before next years fire season 
to maintain now that the 16yearold policy is sound just 
doesnt make sense he said in an interview on the nbctv 
today show 
i am confident that before the next fire season well have a 
revised policy in place which will take into account these kinds of 
conditions hodel said 
in a separate interview on abctvs good morning america 
hodel said the let burn approach toward naturally occurring 
forest fires did not work this season and to suggest thats a 
sound policy just as it stands just doesnt make sense 
hodel said that since july when the policy was abandoned the 
forest service and the park service agreed to treat every blaze in 
yellowstone national park as a wildfire meaning it would be fought 
with every resource possible 
there isnt anybody today who wouldnt tell me they would have 
fought every fire from the beginning of the season if they could 
have foreseen what would happen this year hodel said 
he said fires that have destroyed homes in california are coming 
at the beginning of the fire season there were there where we 
were in july or early august in yellowstone he said 
president reagans spokesman said tuesday that no time should be 
wasted now arguing over the let burn policy and that the 
governments attention will be focused on snuffing out blazes 
raging in eight states 
the comments came after reagan was briefed at the white house on 
the fires which have charred some 4 million acres this summer 
reagan was told that there is no way to predict when the fires 
will be put out but that the administration has dedicated every 
resource available to doing so said spokesman marlin fitzwater 
asked about the harsh criticism that has erupted over the park 
service policy of letting naturally occurring fires burn fitzwater 
contended it was not the time for such a debate 
he noted that the policy had been suspended in july and that any 
new fires that erupt will be fought for the remainder of this 
years fire season 
it doesnt serve anybody to get into discussions about policy 
disputes he said adding were in the middle of a fire 
situation of serious proportion and were fighting it with 
everything at hand 
noting that the nation hasnt seen such fires in its history he 
did acknowledge that the situation calls for some review of the 
policy 
at this point whats clear is that the fires are out of 
control there is no need to argue over policy differences 
until we come up with the next firefighting season next year right 
now its allout fightthefires he said 
fitzwater briefed reporters after reagan met with hodel 
agriculture secretary richard lyng and deputy defense secretary 
william h taft

came from a usually strong reagan administration supporter sen 
orrin hatch rutah who called the situation a catastrophe 
hatch speaking to reporters after visiting the white house 
said we all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying 
hey dont let this burn and they could have contained it at 
that time 
referring to the damage done to yellowstone national park hatch 
said now you have a million acres lost in one of the most 
important national park areas in the world its a 
catastrophe

president reagan on a political trip 
for his vice president george bush declared today that the 
national economy is strong and what we have seen in the last 
eight years is only the beginning 
we intend to ensure this kind of economic prosperity right 
through the 90s and into the next century by guaranteeing the 
federal government can never again spend and tax the american 
people into another economic nightmare reagan said 
the presidents remarks were prepared for delivery at a 
republican rally at southeast missouri state university in this 
mississippi river shipping center 
he was to speak later in the day to an expected crowd of 1000 
at a 250aplate gop fundraising dinner in st louis 
in his cape girardeau speech reagan said children born today 
will know the brightest future the world has ever seen 
that bright future is also yours he told his audience it 
is your birthright as americans and what we have seen in the last 
eight years is only the beginning 
the national economy has been expanding for more than five years 
following the steep recession that marked reagans first two years 
in office 
ultimately the choice before the american people is the 
choice between two visions he said it is the choice between 
the policies of liberalism or the policies of americas political 
mainstream 
the president a former democrat said that partys liberal 
leadership has turned a once proud party of hope and 
affirmation into one dominated by strident liberalism and 
negativism 
the truth is that when you take a walk down our oppositions 
memory lane it starts to look like a nightmare on elm street if 
you want to remember how things really were just a few years back 
think of the year 1979 he said 
in that one year iran nicaragua and grenada were all lost 
that was the year 1979 dont we have the right to ask the american 
people if the liberals return to power what happens in 1989 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said in advance of the trip that 
reagan would be giving traditional political speeches trying to 
win support for the republican ticket of bush and dan quayle 
the president plans one or two speaking forays each week until 
the nov 8 election 
gop candidates hoping to benefit from the missouri events 
include gov john ashcroft seeking a second term against 
democratic state rep betty hearnes of charleston who is the wife 
of former gov warren hearnes and sen john danforth opposed by 
state sen jay nixon of hillsboro as he seeks his third term 
both ashcroft and danforth enjoy comfortable leads in state 
public opinion polls 
bush speaking tuesday in jefferson city the state capital 
pledged we will never go back to the grainembargo days of those 
democrats carter and mondale and who knows who else 
reagan took missouris 11 electoral votes with 51 percent of the 
popular vote against thenpresident carter in 1980 and swept the 
state with 60 percent of the popular vote against walter mondale in 
1984 
records showed that the only incumbent president to visit cape 
girardeau previously was william howard taft on oct 26 1902 
in st louis the states most populous city with a metropolitan 
area population of more than 2 million the president was to speak 
at an event for the missouri gop victory 88 fund

wisconsin democrats dashed the comeback hopes of a former 
governor by nominating a millionaire sports club owner to succeed 
sen william proxmire while in arizona seven republican 
legislators who helped oust former gov evan mecham were defeated 
by his supporters 
elsewhere in six state primaries tuesday two republican 
congressmen from new england passed the first hurdle toward higher 
office 
vermont rep jim jeffords won the right to face democrat william 
gray a former us attorney for the seat of retiring gop sen 
robert stafford 
new hampshire rep judd gregg son of a former governor 
captured his partys nomination to succeed republican gov john 
sununu and will run against democrat paul mceachern 
minnesota voters as expected set up a november clash between 
republican sen dave durenberger seeking a third term and 
democratic attorney general hubert h skip humphrey iii 
in the arizona primary the most prominent casualties were 
senate president carl kunasek beaten by mecham supporter jerry 
gillespie and house speaker joe lane a republican who started the 
impeachment process against mecham last fall he lost to mecham 
backers lloyd fenn and warren shumaker not all the former 
governors supporters were successful his press secretary ron 
bellus was trounced by former senate president leo corbet 
the victor in wisconsins democratic senate primary was herbert 
kohl the milwaukee bucks basketball team owner who spent 21 
million mostly his own money on a campaign built mainly on tv ads 
kohl seeking office for the first time said voters wanted a 
qualified nonpolitician with real businessworld experience and 
they said they want a senator wholl be independent of special 
interests 
but former gov anthony s earl who finished second in a 
fiveway race said he hoped there could still be a place for 
personal campaigning not so reliant on big money 
i dont think herb kohl would mind if i say he got the most 
votes but i got the best votes said earl who lost the 
governorship in 1986 after one term 
kohl will face state sen susan engeleiter who defeated stephen 
b king a conservative former state gop chairman engeleiter in a 
reference to kohls wealth said there were major differences 
between me and herb kohl i am an average member of an average 
wisconsin family i understand the concerns of the people out 
there 
king had criticized engeleiter for seeking the senate when she 
has two small children at home 
that theme also was sounded in new hampshire when sen gordon 
humphrey said former state sen betty tamposi should not seek the 
gop nomination for congress because she has a 22monthold 
daughter humphrey apologized two days later but the candidate he 
backed former state supreme court justice chuck douglas won a 
sixway race 
in new hampshires gop gubernatorial primary gregg brushed 
aside two opponents then promptly attacked mceachern vowing to 
show the people of new hampshire what deep philosophical 
differences there are a choice between fiscal restraint and 
liberal spending 
in vermont jeffords soundly defeated conservative michael 
griffes after a primary in which his frequent opposition to 
president reagans policies became an issue jeffords said griffes 
supporters had overstated the case to put it nicely in 
attacking him on issues such as gun control and abortion 
im hurt that people would feel so emotional about me that 
they would want to try to destroy me said jeffords whose 
popularity among democrats makes him a heavy favorite 
primaries also were held in 
utah where democrat robert stringham edged craig oliver for 
the nomination to oppose republican rep howard nielson 
the district of columbia where all five city council members 
up for reelection gained their partys nomination the council has 
13 members

a british soldier said today that he shot an 
ira member because he thought the guerrilla was about to detonate a 
car bomb 
the soldier one of four special air services soldiers who shot 
and killed three unarmed ira members testified during an inquest 
into the shootings 
he was identified only as soldier a and was hidden from public 
view by a curtain for security reasons 
the soldier told the inquest he began shooting after a sudden 
aggressive movement by irish republican army member daniel mccann 
the british military said it believed the ira man was about to 
carry out a car bombing in this british colony 
in an intense crossexamination patrick mcgrory the attorney 
for the families of the three dead men accused soldier a of lying 
i put it to you that it the movement by mccann didnt 
happen you shot him in the back without any movement whatsoever 
mcgrory said 
there was movement im not blind the soldier responded 
i thought he was going for a button a switch to detonate the 
bomb he said this was my major worry at this stage 
the testimony of soldier a came on the seventh day of the 
inquest by gibraltar coroner felix pizzarello and an 11man jury 
into the march 6 shooting deaths of sean savage 24 mairead 
farrell 31 and mccann 30 by soldiers of the elite 
antiterrorist unit 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
allege the shootings were evidence of an unofficial 
shoottokill policy directed against ira members on missions 
against british targets 
the ira has acknowledged savage farrell and mccann were members 
on active service at the time of their deaths 
a senior british intelligence officer has testified at the 
inquest that the special services men believed the three were 
planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard 
ceremony set for march 8 
neither a car parked in gibraltar nor another left on the other 
side of the spanish frontier contained a bomb 
but spanish police found a third ira car loaded with 141 pounds 
of czechmade explosives and a timing device in the nearby resort 
city of marbella two days after the shooting 
the inquest has no power of prosecution but is to determine 
whether the sas soldiers involved in the shootings acted lawfully 
if the inquest finds they did not the soldiers could be criminally 
charged 
the seven men who formed the sas unit that took part in the 
operation against the ira members have only been identified as 
soldiers a through g for fear they could become targets of 
revenge attacks 
the ira is fighting to drive the british out of northern ireland 
and unite the province with the irish republic

attorneys said they would appeal the conviction of 
seven former or current police officers on charges of taking bribes 
from bar and restaurant owners to overlook violations and perform 
special services 
i think this is a pretty sad day when the justice department 
can be proud of this kind of prosecution defense attorney paul 
markham said after the verdict tuesday which came on the federal 
jurys sixth day of deliberations 
the defendants were convicted of 55 counts including 
racketeering and extortion they were accused of accepting more 
than 18000 in bribes 
we take no joy in these verdicts today but i believe that 
they will help to strengthen this department in the long term 
police commissioner francis m roache said 
judge a david mazzone set sentencing for oct 11 the officers 
were convicted of two counts of racketeering each carrying up to 
20 years in prison and a 250000 fine they also were convicted of 
extortion which carries the same penalty 
i just think its a sad commentary on the jury system and the 
judicial system said anthony traini who represented kilroe 
much of the prosecutions case rested on tape recordings made by 
a nightclub manager in which officers discussed payoffs 
during closing arguments special prosecutor james b farmer of 
the new england organized crime strike force said the case was 
about misuse of office for personal gain its about each one of 
them using their power as boston police officers to line their own 
pockets 
defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from business 
owners was nothing more than christmas and vacation gifts from 
people with whom the officers worked closely over several years 
the four former officers on trial were thomas j connolly 
francis x sheehan john e carey and peter boylan the three 
current officers were john f mccormick kenneth j nave and 
matthew a kilroe

the attorney for a reputed south american 
drug lord says he will appeal the mans escape conviction on 
grounds he was illegally captured in honduras where his arrest 
april 5 touched off antiamerican riots 
a federal jury tuesday convicted juan ramon matta 43 of 
escaping in 1971 from the federal prison camp at eglin air force 
base in the florida panhandle matta could receive up to five years 
in prison at sentencing oct 27 
defense attorney martin stolar said he will challenge the 
legality of mattas arrest at his home in tegucigalpa the capital 
of honduras 
us district judge roger vinson ruled earlier that matta was 
wanted for possible involvement in international drug smuggling and 
that previous court cases allowed the government to seize people 
outside the united states 
matta was wanted for questioning in the 1985 slaying of us 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena salazar in 
mexico 
no charges have been filed against matta in that case but he is 
under indictment in three california narcotics cases and one in 
arizona 
matta was serving a threeyear sentence at eglin for illegally 
entering the united states fraud and misuse of a visa he was 
accused of slipping out the back door of a chapel at the unfenced 
minimumsecurity prison during church services 
honduran police captured him in a raid by helicopter police and 
american officials put him on a flight to the dominican republic 
and he was flown from there to new york 
matta had been living openly in tegucigalpa since 1986 when he 
escaped from a colombian prison he had been held on charges 
involving the medellin cartel responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine brought into the united states 
his return to the united states touched off rioting in 
tegucigalpa by students leftists and others that killed several 
protesters and ended in the burning of the us consulate 
demonstrators contended mattas extradition was barred by the 
honduran constitution 
extra security officers were posted for the trial here

fbi director william sessions said today he is 
suspending three bureau employees and censuring three others for 
mishandling a terrorism investigation into political opponents of 
the reagan administrations central american policy 
i am disciplining these individuals because of the 
managerial or supervisory inadequacies displayed by them during a 
bureau investigation of the committee in solidarity with the people 
of el salvador sessions told a congressional committee 
the mistakes in judgment that took place during the cispes 
investigation were serious ones and i cannot emphasize too 
strongly my firm conviction that there is no place for such 
mistakes in the work of the fbi session told the senate 
intelligence committee 
sessions became director of the fbi in november he disciplined 
the agents for actions taken from march 1983 to june 1985 when 
william webster was the fbis boss webster now heads the cia 
sessions said the six employees work variously at the 
supervisory unit chief and section chief levels and that they 
include personnel from fbi headquarters in washington as well as at 
fbi field offices 
three of the employees whom he did not name have been placed 
on probation and suspended without pay for 14 days the other three 
were formally censured he said with reprimands being placed in 
the employees files that could affect their chances for promotions 
the director said a seventh employee whose performance would 
in all likelihood would have have merited dismissal has 
resigned that was an apparent reference to an agent who quit in 
1984 after acknowleding he had given classified documents to an 
informant in the cispes case 
sessions testified that the investigation was launched in march 
1983 based largely on information provided by informer frank 
varelli the probe concentrated on the organizations headquarters 
in washington its dallas chapter and on a handful of other cispes 
chapters 
the investigation was prompted by tips that key members of 
cispes were involved in covertly furnishing funds and material to a 
leftist group seeking to seize power in el salvador 
varelli told the bureau in 1984 that cispes members were 
plotting to assassinate president reagan and disrupt the republican 
national convention in dallas 
fbi officials now say varelli supplied them with disinformation 
and misinformation he stopped working for the bureau in 1984 and 
filed suit in 1986 to get some back pay he felt he was owed 
the major problem came when the scope of the investigation was 
unnecessarily broadened in october 1983 sessions testified 
the broadening of the investigation in essence directed 
all field offices to regard each cispes chapter wherever located 
as a proper subject of the investigation 
sessions said that based on the available documentation 
there was no reason to believe that all cispes members nationwide 
knew of or had any involvement in support of el salvadoran or us 
terrorists thus there was no reason to expand the investigation 
so widely 
the fbi director said the decision to broaden the probe 
unnecessarily was made at a comparatively low level and 
supervisory personnel at fbi headquarters who should have reviewed 
and analyzed this decision and appreciated its significance failed 
to do so 
sessions said there is no evidence that the white house or any 
other government agency or outside private group attempted to 
influence the cispes probe he said there is no evidence the probe 
was politically motivated or director or that the conduct by the 
six fbi employees who are being disciplined was illegal or 
motivated by any improper purpose 
the cispes probe involved surveillance undercover attendance at 
meetings interviews with organization members and checks of 
telephone and utility company records and records of license and 
credit bureaus as well as law enforcement agency record checks 
the probe was closed when the justice department concluded the 
group was involved in political activities protected by the first 
amendment and not involved in terrorism 
details of the cispes probe became public in february when a new 
york lawyers group obtained documents showing that fbi agents 
photographed protesters at peace rallies recorded license plate 
numbers and investigated nuns union members and college students

the soviet union today conducted 
its first nuclear test explosion to be monitored by us experts 
the blast at a longsecret testing ground shook the earths surface 
and shattered a window 
the explosion in soviet kazakhstan had a force of 100150 
kilotons the official news agency tass said several times more 
powerful than the bomb that devastated hiroshima japan at the end 
of world war ii 
the hagfors observatory of the swedish defense research 
establishment said it measured the explosion at 50 to 150 kilotons 
buried in a hole more than 2000 feet deep the nuclear 
explosion was felt and heard 24 miles away at the forward command 
post 
the ground shook and a low rumble was heard as a reddish cloud 
of dust rose above the test site and the earths surface bucked 
the blast was not expected to have a noticeable impact at the 
observation site about 30 miles from the blast but it shattered a 
window in one building 
the radiation situation in the region of the test and beyond 
the boundaries of the test site is normal tass reported after 
the blast at 8 am the sparsely populated region is 1700 miles 
east of moscow 
sophisticated american sensors planted just over 10 yards from 
the device itself and five seismic sensors each in the united 
states and soviet union were designed to gauge the force of the 
blast 
the verification techniques were expected to lead the us 
senate to ratify two longpending treaties limiting the size of 
underground blasts 
the goal of the experiment is to bring into practice the most 
effective means of control in order to use them for verifying the 
1974 agreement on limiting underground tests of nuclear weapons and 
the 1976 agr eement on underground nuclear explosions for peaceful 
purposes the soviet government newspaper izvestia said 
however they did not go into effect because the american side 
considers the measures of control insufficient it said 
the joint verification experiment which included a similar 
blast at a us testing range at pahute mesa nevada a month ago 
marks a turning point in the two superpowers nuclear test policies 
the topsecret experiments always have been off limits to 
scientists from the other side who were forced to rely on data 
gathered at great distance to determine the force of underground 
explosions 
both sides accused the other of exceeding agreedupon limits 
and the united states balked at ratifying the two treaties from the 
1970s until it could monitor explosions close up 
the soviets who have been campaigning for an end to all nuclear 
testing agreed earlier this year to go along with onsite 
measurement 
an american team of up to 40 specialists has been working at the 
test site since april to drill a hole parallel to the soviet test 
hole and plant the cortex hydrodynamic measuring device that the 
us government regards as the most sensitive gauge of a nuclear 
explosion 
giant us air force c5a cargo planes ferried drilling rigs and 
monitoring equipment into the sleepy semipalatinsk airport to 
prepare for todays test 
no one thought even a year ago that what is about to happen 
could happen said us team chief c paul robinson told 
reporters monday on his arrival to observe the test 
he called the experiment a real triumph of 
confidencebuilding for both sides

an irs agent says he found no legitimate 
business purpose for a personal 300foot water slide two 
rollsroyces and hundreds of thousands of dollars that jim and 
tammy bakker and a key aide got through ptl 
larry howlett an auditor of taxexempt organizations was the 
second witness tuesday in the trial of the ministrys 52 million 
claim against the bakkers and former ptl aide david taggart the 
trial began monday in us bankruptcy court 
under crossexamination today howlett conceded that because of 
a lack of documentation he could only assume that a business 
purpose was lacking and that the expenditures were for personal use 
ptl attorneys are seeking to force the bakkers and taggart to 
repay the money they say was lost through through mismanagement of 
funds that included cash advances on ptl credit cards and 
unjustified compensation and benefits 
howlett listed among the expenditures with no legitimate 
business purpose a 300foot water slide at bakkers lake wylie 
home which has since been sold and 32000 worth of luggage 
bakker attorney ryan hovis asked howlett today whether the 
rollsroyces and two mercedes were solely for the personal use of 
the bakkers 
ptls check paid for them but the paperwork was inconclusive 
as to who the owner was howlett said theres no documentation 
that bakker used the cars 
on tuesday howlett testified that the irs could find no 
documentation to support the business purpose of about 300000 in 
cash advances made to bakker and taggart between 1984 and 1986 
there was no backup documentation for any of the cash 
advances none of them howlett said we tried to evaluate the 
business nature of these items but we could not determine any 
howlett also testified that records show neither bakker nor 
taggart attempted to reimburse the ministry for money taken from 
three executive accounts 
the ptl television ministry and heritage usa theme park at fort 
mill filed for reorganization in bankruptcy court in june 1987 
three months after bakker left the ministry amid a sex and money 
scandal involving church secretary jessica hahn 
earlier tuesday a former ptl accountant said he was frustrated 
that bakker and other top ministry executives continually ignored 
his memos warning that the ministry financially was facing real 
emergencies 
peter bailey who was an accountant and financial director at 
ptl from june 1979 through july 1987 also testified that top 
executives received bonuses in anticipation of money coming into 
the ministrys coffers but that there was often no money in the 
bank to cover those bonuses 
hovis said tuesday that us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds is 
expected to adjourn the trial after this weeks testimony well 
probably present our case in a month or so hovis said during a 
break in the hearing 
the bakkers and taggart stayed away from the hearing again 
today just as they have skipped preceding sessions hovis has said 
he will call them as witnesses

harvard in a reversal plans to set up 
companies to help the university make money off professors 
discoveries 
eight years ago harvard decided against commercial involvement 
saying it could compromise the universitys commitment to knowledge 
harvard is trying to get corporations to invest up to 35 
million that would be used to organize companies around the work of 
researchers mostly those at harvard medical school the boston 
globe said today 
if the companies were successful they would be sold and 
harvard would get 10 percent of the profits 
some academics fear that the profit motive can distort what they 
see as their main role the search for knowledge by introducing 
subtle pressures on researchers to spend their time on projects 
with commercial potential 
harvard president derek bok and other university officials said 
the plan addresses concerns about mixing business and learning 
there are few things that matter to me more than trying to strike 
this balance he told the globe 
the plans complicated financial arrangement is designed to 
allow the university to profit from the work of faculty members 
without getting directly involved in commercialization the 
university said 
researchers who make potentially profitable discoveries would 
not be required to sign up with harvards commercial arm if they 
preferred to make their own arrangements with private investors 
in 1980 the university planned to join harvard biochemist mark 
f ptashne in forming a genetic engineering company harvard helped 
organize the company and find initial investors in return for 15 
percent of the companys stock 
but bok pulled harvard out of the arrangement he said directly 
investing in commercializing researchers work could confuse the 
universitys central commitment to the pursuit of knowledge and 
learning 
medical school dean daniel c tosteson said tuesday that he was 
trying to find a way to augment the schools 350 million research 
budget speed development of useful research and more directly 
profit from arrangements that professors were making on their own 
with private investors

israeli officials said today that plo chief 
yasser arafats greeting to israel on the occasion of the jewish 
new year was nothing but a stunt and should not be taken seriously 
arafat extended wishes for a peaceful new year in the middle 
east at a news conference in strasbourg france where he addressed 
socialist members of the european parliament a day earlier 
to all israelis and to all jews shana tova shana tova 
arafat said using the hebrew expression for happy new year 
when i say shana tova i mean a peaceful new year for 
all our children all our peoples for the whole of the middle 
east arafat said speaking in arabic with israeli peace activist 
abie nathan 
arafat also said he was willing to meet with israeli government 
respresentatives at the united nations 
nathan met with arafat in tunis this week he could be 
prosecuted when he returns for holding such a meeting which 
violates a 1986 israeli law banning contacts with terrorist groups 
israeli officials dismissed arafats greeting as a public 
relations ploy but proplo palestinians said it showed arafat 
favored a political solution and was seeking peace 
really its a stunt a foreign ministry official said 
its very nice to say shana tova in front of a group of 
journalists but it would be more constructive if in his speech 
yesterday there were some concrete change in policy the official 
said on condition of anonymity 
addressing parliament members tuesday arafat repeated his call 
for the creation of an independent palestinian state in the 
occupied territories 
he also reiterated the plos insistence that israel recognize 
palestinian rights to selfdetermination 
a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said arafats 
gesture would not change the rightwing likud partys opposition to 
holding talks with the plo we will not be misled by the lip 
service of mr arafat and seeming gestures like wishing shana 
tova to our people the spokesman yossi ahimeir said 
we know him very well and we continue in our policy to seek 
peace but not to have contacts with mr arafat and his 
organization he said with gods help we shall overcome all 
our enemies 
israeli leftist uri avnery who has met with arafat 10 times 
since 1982 said the hebrew greeting showed arafat sincerely sought 
negotiations with israel 
it is obvious that arafat is ready to talk to israelis now he 
is speaking in a friendly tone towards israelis and jews avnery 
said in an interview 
they say new sounds make new music so now there are new 
sounds of hebrew in the plo said avnery who first met arafat 
in beirut during the israeli invasion of lebanon 
jack khazmo the proplo publisher of the palestinian weekly 
albayader assiyasi said arafats gesture showed he was abandoning 
aggression in favor of a political solution in the occupied 
territories 
this means the plo is putting aside the military option it 
means the plo is willing to knock on the door of peace khazmo 
said 
as sign of how little credence israeli officials placed on the 
greeting one government spokesman said you can tell arafat that 
this israeli official jokingly returns his wishes for peace in the 
middle east

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen said today that he and michael dukakis were for a 
strong defense based on practical weapons and not the buck 
rogers dreams of the reagan admnistration 
the texas senator stumping in his home state where polls show 
the democrats slightly behind said both he and dukakis know the 
first duty of any president is to defend the united states against 
all enemies 
in a speech at the site of a collection of world war ii 
airplanes bentsen said the democrats supported the stealth and b1 
bombers the cruise missile and other new weapons including 
research and development of strategic defenses 
but we are living in the real world not some science 
fiction movie he said and in the real world real wars are 
still fought with real tanks and guns and fighter planes 
under this administration buck rogers has been promoted and 
our conventional forces have been neglected allowing the soviets 
to gain in those areas he said 
bentsen spoke in harlingen where he toured a collection of world 
war ii military aircraft he donned a leather flight jacket 
climbed aboard one of the planes and the engine was started up 
however he didnt fly any of them the former b24 bomber pilot 
says he stopped flying after he joined the senate in 1970 besides 
the collection does not include any b24s 
bentsen planned to travel this afternoon to an ltv corp defense 
plant near dallas for another speech 
bentsens appearances on the defense issue were part of an 
overall focus on the topic this week by the dukakisbentsen 
campaign especially in the south dukakis is seen as needing to 
convince voters he would have a strong defense policy 
vice president george bush the republican nominee has been 
painting dukakis as a liberal whose opposition to many new weapons 
systems such as the mx and midgetman missiles would amount to 
unilateral disarmament of the us military

a horse breeder has pleaded innocent 
to charges he sold two foals that he claimed were offspring of a 
mare who was in fact infertile 
celestino dilibero of citra was accused in a fraud indictment of 
scheming with racing officials to list the foals in the official 
thoroughbred registry as offspring of rare personality whose 
father won the preakness in 1971

dilibero entered his innocent plea tuesday the others charged

a swedish researcher who has implanted 
human fetal tissue into the brains of two patients with parkinsons 
disease told a national institutes of health committee today it 
would be unethical not to use such experimental treatment 
dr lars olson professor of neurobiology at karolinska 
institute in stockholm was among experts asked to appear before 
the nih panel considering what us government policy should be on 
such research which the white house proposes to ban 
one of the questions the 21member panel of outside experts was 
asked to consider was whether animal studies have progressed enough 
to warrant using the procedure on humans 
the animal data are so promising we have approached a 
point where i believe it is unethical not to do this in human 
studies replied olsen 
he said his human studies involve two patients who received 
fetal brain cell transplants eight months ago after suffering from 
the disease for 15 years and not responding to other treatment 
he described both as extreme cases severely handicappped and 
out of control 
he made no dramatic claims but said there have been no 
adverse effects it appears that we are seeing minor positive 
changes in the patients 
he said the transplanted cells have not had time to fully mature 
and expressed optimism that the patients both women in their 50s 
will continue to improve 
the panel was concentrating on scientific issues today and will 
turn to moral and ethical considerations thursday before drafting 
its recommendations on friday 
a proposed executive order from the white house not intended 
for public disclosure would prohibit experimentation with fetal 
tissue 
some members of the advisory panel which includes doctors 
researchers lawyers and medical ethicists were offended that the 
white house had proposed a position on the issue before the 
committee had a chance to meet 
nih director james b wyngaarden appointed the committee on the 
instructions of dr robert e windom the assistant hhs secretary 
for health 
the issue surfaced last april when nih sought clearance for 
experiments in which brain cells from a fetus would be transplanted 
into patients suffering from parkinsons disease 
windom denied permission saying new questions raised by such 
research warranted careful review 
researchers are hopeful the new techniques will prove useful in 
treating parkinsons and a variety of other diseases such as 
alzheimers and juvenile diabetes 
however the treatment involves use of fresh brain cells 
virtually requiring that they be obtained from planned induced 
abortions rather than natural miscarriages 
the moral and ethical questions raised are illustrated by an 
expressed desire by some women to become pregnant so they can 
produce an aborted fetus to use in treating relatives 
ethicists also have expressed concern that any guidelines for 
such procedures would have to deal with the possibility that 
researchers would pay for abortions in order to obtain tissue 
gary l bauer president reagans assistant for policy 
development sent health and human services secretary otis r bowen 
a draft executive order accompanied by a memo saying he wanted to 
rush the proposed federal ban into effect as soon as possible 
however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday that 
the proposed executive order did not represent official white house 
policy and was merely an early draft to get discussion started 
it shall be the policy of the federal government to the 
extent permitted by law that an unborn or newborn child who has 
died as a result of an induced abortion shall not be used for 
purposes of research or transplantation said the draft 
circulated by bauer 
surgeons in mexico city reported last january that they had 
injected fresh fetal tissue from a miscarried fetus into the brains 
of two parkinsons suffers with promising results

or other escorts of the olympic flame was hit and the procession 
did not halt as it passed by the school in a semirural area the 
witnesses said

several colleges in seoul protesters burned the american flag and 
shouted yankee go home

thousands returned to their homes 
as fire officials heartened by a day of favorable weather lifted 
evacuation orders and reopened all major highways where a fire 
ravaged gold rush country 
calmer winds lower temperatures and higher humidity tuesday and 
today helped crews as they bulldozed lines around more than 90 
percent of the 3dayold blaze which gutted nearly 100 homes and 
threatened as many as 5000 
the fire really laid down it was even hard to find embers in 
some regions overnight fire operations chief bill holmes said 
today 
as far as i know we have allowed everyone who wants to return 
home to do so state department of forestry spokesman steve 
iverson said tuesday 
but some of the 8000 residents evacuated had little or nothing 
to return to in the charred foothills of the sierra nevada 
northeast of sacramento 
rusty cline 51 of the tiny community of rough and ready was 
part of a stream of refugees at a high school evacuation center 
tuesday which american red cross worker elizabeth quirk dubbed 
the morning of tears 
the fire raced in on us we ran for the car but it beat us 
there said cline weeping i couldnt get my dog in the car 
she was too scared her dogs fate was unknown 
preliminary damage estimates were set at about 9 million but 
authorities expected the figure to climb 
officials also prepared today to begin relieving some of the 
2800 firefighters who have battled the fire which consumed more 
than 52 square miles of timber and brush or 33500 acres since it 
was started sunday 
if it holds through the night well consider releasing some 
people said iverson the planning chief for the firefighting 
force 
full containment of the fire was expected by thursday night 
said jack placchi a us forestry service spokesman 
the fire which apparently was started by a transient burning a 
piece of toilet paper was one of several blackening northern 
california and the droughtparched west including fires that have 
charred nearly 1 million acres of yellowstone national park 
the blaze had been whipped by 30plus mph gusts through monday 
but on tuesday winds were a moderate 5 to 7 mph while temperatures 
were about 10 degrees lower and the humidity level nearly double 
iverson said 
the fire today cooperated quite a bit he said 
the one drawback to the weather was an air inversion that forced 
the grounding of eight aerial tankers which had dropped more than 
2000 tons of fire retardant on the blaze sunday and monday 
the swiftmoving blaze had threatened 4000 to 5000 structures 
but only 97 homes and 60 other buildings had burned 
iverson said no additional homes were threatened as of tuesday 
night but homes in unburned pockets within fire lines could be 
threatened if winds shifted or pick up he added 
theres no nice clear fire line its a checkerboard he 
said 
fire officials reopened state highways 20 between grass valley 
and marysville and 49 north of nevada city some restrictions 
however remained on secondary roads where mopup operations 
continued 
flames tuesday also scorched grasslands in the deserted eastern 
sector of beale air force base home for some of the nations most 
sophisticated spy planes but the fire was stopped more than four 
miles from the edge of the main part of the base firefighters said 
its all out its history there are no problems there 
said bill holmes a state forestry spokesman 
the drought which increased the amount of tinderdry grass and 
bush created a dangerous and unpredictable condition for 
firefighters and residents along with the winds and low humidity 
but no firefighter suffered a serious injury iverson said 
seven had been treated at hospitals for minor burns and 500 had 
checked into first aid stations with cuts scrapes and sprains he 
said 
there were no reports of injuries among those evacuated iverson 
said

the lebanese army today closed the only 
crossing between beiruts christian and moslem sectors after shiite 
moslem militiamen took to the streets in west beirut for the first 
time in 17 months 
the actions came a day after the countrys shiitemoslem defense 
minister was briefly held hostage by christian militiamen forces 
heightening tensions between christians and moslems deadlocked over 
the election of a new president 
the political wrangling has raised fears that fighting will 
renew lebanons 13yearold civil war 
a statement said army commander gen michel aoun issued the 
order to close the midcity museum crossing only travelers on 
their way to or from the airport were exempt 
a military source said the militiamen belonging to the amal 
organization headed by justice minister nabih berri took up 
positions near the crossing and set up a traffic checkpoint 
the command decided to close the crossing in light of amals 
suspicious move to avoid jeopardizing the lives of civilians 
said the source speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said amals move could result in reciprocal deployment by

residents along the gulf coast today 
stockpiled food and supplies and prepared for mass evacuations as 
they braced for hurricane gilbert deemed one of the most dangerous 
in history 
the hurricane with 175 mph wind ripped through jamaica and the 
cayman islands and took aim at the resort island of cozumel 
mexico and the gulf of mexico at least 11 people have been killed 
and an estimated 60000 left homeless 
forecasters were reluctant to predict the destination of the 
storm called extremely dangerous by the national weather 
service but some early guesses ranged from freeport about 30 
miles southwest of galveston to the louisiana coast 
a hurricane is like a gorilla normally it goes where it 
really wants to go said harlingen tv forecaster larry james 
robert sheets director of the national hurricane center in 
coral gables fla said on abcs good morning america that 
texas and louisiana residents ought to be thinking about what 
theyre going to do in case warnings are posted for their area 
asked about the threat to the united states sheets said 
were looking at about 48 hours or so maybe as much as 60 hours 
but probably somewhere on the texas or louisiana coast theres a 
little uncertainty exactly where this hurricanes going to go 
robert lansford state coordinator of the governors division of 
emergency management in austin said on good morning america 
that he thought the state had time to prepare weve got our 
fingers crossed he added 
local governments along the coast have been working feverishly 
for the last 24 hours trying to get ready for this thing trying to 
find out where its going to go lansford said 
for the second time in two weeks oil companies evacuated 
thousands of workers from rigs in the gulf last week workers were 
brought inland when hurricane florence washed ashore in louisiana 
bill tompkins coordinator for the galveston county emergency 
preparedness said communications systems were being tested and 
procedures were being reviewed based on forecasts from at least 
four sources he expected the storm to be in the gulf by thursday 
morning 
thats probably our most critical time he said well be 
making decisions thursday morning about what to recommend to the 
citizens 
in brownsville cameron county sheriff alex perez said he has 
already posted special schedules for his officers to follow if a 
hurricane watch is issued 
weve contacted all the schools for shelters to see which 
ones well be using this time said perez were getting all 
the emergency generators ready for the jails and getting extra gas 
for the patrol cars and getting everything set up 
gene graves marketing director for petroleum helicopters inc 
in lafayette la said his companys 18 bases in the gulf coast 
region were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs he 
estimated that all the 10000 or so workers who normally work the 
gulf would be evacuated by this afternoon 
i dont think anybodys going to ride this one out he said 
weve got to have about a 24hour cushion to play with this one 
at the south texas nuclear project near bay city employees 
secured down loose objects at a reactor under construction 
employees reviewed procedures at the other reactor which is in 
operation said spokesman glen walker 
the plant is 13 miles from the coast and its containment center 
is built to withstand natures forces including earthquakes and 
370 mph winds he said 
the plant is probably the safest most hurricaneproof plant 
along the gulf coast he said 
at nasas johnson space center spokesman kyle herring said the 
hurricane would not delay the flight of space shuttle discovery 
scheduled for launch later this month from cape canaveral fla 
the gulf coast regional blood center and major hospitals asked 
for blood donations 
in lowlying southern louisiana today schools closed early 
coastal residents headed inland and workers prepared evacuation 
centers 
apprehensive residents in galveston crowded stores in search of 
provisions such as batteries and plywood to board up windows 
i stayed here for hurricane alicia because i didnt realize 
how bad it was going to be said verne gordon but i vowed id 
never stay again 
i really think alicia is what has scared almost all of us 
in 1983 alicia killed 21 people injured 1800 and caused an 
estimated 3 billion in damages when it slammed ashore and blasted 
galveston and houston but alicia was a minimal category 3 on the 
saffirsimpson scale of hurricane strength with top winds at 130 
mph compared to the gilberts category 5 and 175 mph winds tuesday 
the scale lists such a storm as potentially causing catastrophic 
damage and having a storm surge of greater than 18 feet the 
weather service said hurricane gilbert was the most intense storm 
on record in terms of barometric pressure 
in september 1900 galveston was the scene of the nations worst 
natural disaster when an estimated 6000 people were killed in a 
hurricane 
off louisianas coast the only school on grand isle grand 
isle high school was to close early today and remain closed 
thursday and friday the town of about 2000 lies unprotected 
connected to the mainland by a twolane highway

leonid i brezhnevs grandson complained in an 
article published today that criticism of the late soviet leader 
had turned into a smear campaign 
andrei brezhnev said his family should not be blamed for the 
mistakes made by the late soviet leader 
the fullpage article in the weekly moscow news was a rare 
public defense of the man who served as communist party chairman 
and president in the soviet union from 1964 until his death in 1982 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the official press 
carries almost daily articles and letters criticizing brezhnev for 
everything from the slump in the economy to his large collection of 
medals 
brezhnevs soninlaw yuri churbanov is on trial in moscow on 
charges of bribetaking and abuse of office as a top interior 
ministry official under brezhnev 
andrei brezhnev said the disgrace of his grandfather was hurting 
him he is the son of yuri brezhnev 
im 27 years old and my independent life is only beginning 
but i already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become 
a stumbling block in the most varied situations the younger 
brezhnev wrote i am just like everyone but many dont want to 
see anything in me except my surname 
brezhnevs grandson said he agreed with much of the criticism 
appearing now in the soviet press of the former soviet president 
and communist party chief but that relatives should not share the 
blame 
he recalled that under soviet dictator josef stalin relatives 
were arrested or shot simply because of their family ties with 
criminals 
if you read now about the crimes of the 1930s we remember the 
words a son should not answer for his father then why do we 
forget them when speaking about the present day 
andrei brezhnev also said some criticism was unjustified because 
it blamed his grandfather for mistakes made by aides 
legends and rumors arose about brezhnevs family he said 
because the private life of our leaders their family 
irregularities and problems remain outside the direct attention of 
society outside glasnost 
glasnost gorbachevs policy of openness has generally not been 
extended to reporting on the inner workings of the top government 
and party organizations or the personal lives of leaders 
first and foremost brezhnev himself became a victim of the 
absence of glasnost andrei brezhnev said 
he said his aunt brezhnevs daughter galina helped bring down 
the family name because she was uncontrollable and didnt 
respect the law she is married to churbanov 
in its edition last week moscow news published an article by 
historian roy medvedev saying that brezhnev was revived from 
clinical death in 1976 however the article said the leader 
was left senile and so weakened that he had difficulty performing 
simply protocol duties for the last six years of his rule 
medvedev also said that politically brezhnev didnt so much 
move ahead himself as he was moved ahead by others medvedev also 
criticized brezhnev as a poor speaker and a vain weak man

las cruces nm sunnews on pentagon spending 
the pentagon still cant seem to get a handle on how much money 
to spend 
it seems that some defense contractors have been hiding 
information that would bring down prices on weapons purchased by 
the pentagon as a result the pentagon has spent millions of 
dollars more than it needed to for the weapons 
officials at the pentagon have had some success halting 
overpricing but contractors still arent complying with a 1962 law 
requiring contractors to disclose relevant information about 
contracts 
but the contractors arent entirely to blame it boils down to a 
case of mismanagement within the pentagon 
its always easier to be easy with someone elses money in 
this case ours despite the improvements and efforts by pentagon 
officials to clean up the contracts more improvements obviously 
are needed

the daily astorian astoria ore on the imperial congress 
the most dangerous trend in our government is the entrenchment 
of the house of representatives we have allowed the creation of a 
permanent class of lawmakers 
it is well understood in the political community that a 
house member who gets past his first reelection has got a 
seat in congress for life and at the end of the line he will get 
a pension on the order of 76000 per year and free health care 
 
it does the country no good to have a defeatproof congress is 
there any mystery why the boys and girls on capitol hill have 
ceased to make substantial law and pass only humongous unwieldy 
statutes that contain all sorts of surprises 
the senate used to be known as the most exclusive club in the 
world but that title clearly now belongs to the house of 
representatives

the state columbia sc on political prisoners and hostages 
again a rumor has surfaced that swedish diplomat raoul 
wallenberg is alive and being held in a soviet prison camp 
wallenberg who saved thousands of jews from the nazis during 
world war ii disappeared in the soviet prison system after the 
war the soviet government has maintained that he died of a heart 
attack in 1947 at the age of 35 
but over the years numerous witnesses have reported that he was 
still alive most recently swedish businessman and novelist kenne 
fant said he has been researching the wallenberg case and has 
information that he was alive in december 1986 
but wallenberg is only one example thousands of other political 
prisoners and hostages are confined in soviet gulags central and 
south american jails and middle east terrorist hideouts 
it is far too easy after 40odd years to forget about the 
likes of raoul wallenberg 
but this country and other free nations cannot afford to forget 
these men and women prisoners not for their deeds but for their 
beliefs they have no one else to speak and work for their release

the central maine morning sentinel waterville maine on the 
pledge of allegiance as a campaign issue 
vice president george bush has a real crowd pleaser in his flag 
pledge speech but as an issue the pledge of allegiance is a 
spurious one 
indeed by the time the november election date rolls around it 
largely will be forgetten 
when they look beyond the histrionics voters will find that it 
isnt a question of whether george bush or michael dukakis is the 
more patriotic both have served their country and the patriotism 
of neither is in doubt 
laws or no laws court decisions or no court decisions 99 
percent of the american people proudly recite the pledge of 
allegiance 
forcing the other one percent to say it against their will 
wouldnt make them patriotic 
there are plenty of real issues for vice president bush and gov 
dukakis to talk about and debate lets get on with them

the baltimore sun on the presidential campaign 
with two months to go until election day george bush has jumped 
into a lead over michael dukakis that dismays democrats and has 
republicans talking of another sweep 
with voters so volatile all of this could change especially 
in the crucial fortnight between the end of the world series and 
nov 8 
dukakis prides himself on being a marathoner who likes to stay 
in stride and not be deflected off path his aides are counting on 
bush gaffes and dan quayles liabilities to turn the polls around 
 
what marathoner dukakis seems not to realize is that he is now 
in a 60day dash his proclaimed coolness on tv may serve him well 
in the debates but bushs hot oneliners served up daily against 
photogenic backdrops are what are being run and rerun on nightly 
news shows 
it may be too early for dukakis to sprint but he had better 
step up his pace and run a smarter race if he wants to stay 
competitive

fairmont minn sentinel on making english the official us 
language 
a recent report by the center for immigration studies indicates 
that a record number of immigrants will be coming to america in 
this decade 
this latest report estimates that between 19811990 more than 
10 million immigrants will have crossed americas shores 
this will mark only the second time in one decade that the 
number of new arrivals has surpassed 8 million since 1820 when the 
government began keeping such records 
the recent tidal wave of immigrants has given additional 
impetus to a growing national movement to make english the official 
language of our country 
so far 16 states have passed legislation designating english as 
the official language three other states will have the issue on 
the ballot in november we support this effort 
if america is to remain a melting pot for people from all the 
nations then english should be the only language for documents 
ballots and all official communications

los angeles herald examiner on stopping gang violence 
for the estimated 70000 gangsters mostly young men and boys 
under 20 mostly inhabitants of the regions poorer sections the 
gang is a clan a supplement to or a replacement for family 
ties 
most hardcore gang members are unskilled school dropouts 
most live in poor racially segregated neighborhoods where wages 
are low and unemployment drug addiction and crime are high 
the gang offers what they can get nowhere else protection and 
complete acceptance no diploma required 
firepower and ruthlessness have increased once gangs used 
chains stilettos and the occasional zip gun or revolver to fight 
rivals or abet crimes today legal and illegal rapidfire pistols 
and rifles of immense force have become the weapons of choice 
gang killings were once rare from the 1940s until 1977 there 
were only about 100 for all of los angeles since then there have 
been more than 3100 
children must be the prime target of the communitys effort 
to rid los angeles of gang violence simply put we must cut gangs

saginaw mich news on the media and dan quayle 
news organizations are reporting news about news organizations 
and commenting on it more than ever 
the introspection reached a peak when the dan quayle story 
became two stories one focusing on his decision to join the 
national guard rather than sign up for the vietnam war the other 
examining whether or not reporters went too far in probing the 
republican nominee for vice president 
the public relies on the media for information and citizens 
should be privy to the decisionmaking process involved in 
publishing a newspaper or preparing a broadcast 
but news organizations can eliminate the need for a 
storybystory media catharsis if they stress a consistent 
backtobasics approach that relies on the fundamental concepts of 
journalism 
if reporters keep their opinions to themselves and show less 
arrogance they can cover the important stories and quayles 
background indeed is important without so much public backlash

the daily journal elizabeth nj on dan quayle 
its not that sen dan quayle chose to avoid combat by joining 
a stateside national guard unit its not even the fact that he 
used family pressures to get him to the front of the enlistment 
line 
its the senators subsequent hawkish support of the military 
and his showy patriotism that make him suspect 
the young senator might have recovered lost respect had he 
responded to the embarrassment with grace 
instead he was flippant if i had known then i would be 
running for the vice presidency now i certainly would have chosen 
a different course he said at one point 
to a convention breakfast audience he offered a mock salute and 
his national guard name rank and serial number in attempt to laugh 
the whole thing off 
is a man who reacts so awkwardly to what is essentially a 
lessthanmajor crisis the man we would trust in a time of

the national football leagues substance abuse policy is 
continuing to take its toll and frankly were glad to see it 
images created by drugpopping rolemodel nfl superstars are not 
the ones most parents want their children to see the leagues 
moves to stop drug abuse and to show that it has undesirable 
consequences are laudable 
this is the third year of the nfls drug testing program teams 
of firsttime offenders are notified by the leagues drug office 
secondtime offenders draw minimums of 30day suspensions and 
thirdtimers can be banished for life although they can petition 
for readmission after a year 
to players drawing the salaries paid in the nfl today even a 
30day suspension can be expensive a year can be devastating 
but it should be these overpriced players who so eagerly seek 
professional help in negotiating their salaries could use a little 
help in spending them as well 
a year back at more mundane earning levels goes a long way 
toward restoring reality to their lives

die and demanded that an interim administration lead burma back to 
democracy 
the studentled protesters flooded all main rangoon streets to 
reject the ruling burma socialist program party and its 26 years of 
repression and ruinous economic policies they rejected president 
maung maungs plan for multiparty elections 
step down fascist bspp government and give us an interim 
government shouted the demonstrators who included buddhist 
monks and government employees 
you run or we will kill you the marchers shouted thrusting 
fists in the air if they dont fall make them fall they 
chanted 
all shops and offices were closed wednesday crowd estimates 
ranged from 100000 to 1 million 
staterun radio rangoon urged workers to return to their jobs 
many employees nationwide struck aug 8 to demand democracy and 
food and other commodities have since been in increasingly short 
supply 
strikes shut down the countrys two oil refineries making fuel 
scarce and forcing the army to use reserve stocks foreign 
embassies have turned to the black market and are paying 16 for a 
gallon of gasoline sources said 
a western diplomat in rangoon said the marchers accompanied by 
marching bands included about 100 uniformed policemen and pilots 
and stewardesses whose prodemocracy strikes have grounded all 
commercial flights since last week 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said several 
thousand demonstrators gathered outside the us embassy a 
favorite rallying place and listened to strident speeches by 
protest leaders 
diplomats said they had no indication the authorities would 
yield to demands for an interim government 
demonstrations and prodemocracy strikes also continued in major 
towns nationwide including mandalay taunggyi moulmein and 
bassein but details were not available western diplomats have 
said protesters have taken control of the administrations of about 
40 towns

announced last weekend that it would end oneparty rule and hold

defense minister tin oo declared they would not support or 
participate in governmentorganized elections and reiterated their 
demand for an interim government

to form parties and raise funds staterun radio rangoon reported 
on monday the three issued their first joint statement a letter 
to maung maung calling for an interim government 
the western diplomat said the opposition leaders were expected 
to announce thursday the names of people they want in the 
transition government 
there has not been a groundswell of support for any one 
opposition leader as there was in the philippines when people were 
shouting cory cory the diplomat said speaking anonymously

india on wednesday announced a fiveday 
ceasefire in sri lanka to allow tamil rebels fighting for an 
independent homeland to surrender their arms and take part in local 
elections 
foreign ministry spokesman aftab seth made the announcement to 
reporters in a government statement the ceasefire was to begin at 
7 am thursday 
india has stationed an estimated 47000 troops in sri lankas 
northern and eastern provinces to enforce an accord aimed at ending 
the tamils 5yearold separatist war with the sinhalesedominated 
government the campaign has claimed at least 8500 lives 
the ceasefire comes five days after the merger of the two 
tamildominated provinces and an announcement by the colombo 
government that the election of a combined provincial council would 
be held soon a date for the polls has yet to be announced 
at this juncture it is therefore of the greatest importance 
that all tamil groups in sri lanka use this historic opportunity to 
come forward and participate in the forthcoming provincial council 
elections the indian statement said 
the government of india hopes that all tamil groups will 
come forward and join the mainstream of life and play an effective 
role in ensuring the welfare of the people of the northeastern 
province it said 
all groups wishing to participate in the elections must lay 
down their arms and support the indosri lanka agreement the 
statement said 
in colombo a senior government official said the announcement 
was sudden 
nobody knows what is going on because this is an indian 
decision said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
everybody obviously welcomes the ceasefire but it will have to 
be studied before any official comments can be made 
none of the tamil groups commented on the announcement 
the indiabrokered peace accord stipulates the surrender of arms 
by the insurgents in exchange for limited autonomy in the provinces 
the rebels briefly accepted the july 1987 accord but reneged on 
it last fall claiming it did not meet their aspirations 
india which sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of 
its own 60 million tamils sent troops to sri lanka last october to 
force the tamils to surrender 
at least 575 indian soldiers have been killed in hitandrun 
attacks by the rebels and more than 1700 have been wounded india 
claims its soldiers have killed more than 1500 rebels and captured 
1300 others but says the tamil movement is still far from finished 
the accord also has been criticized by the sinhalese the 
majority in sri lanka they say the accord grants too many 
concessions to the tamils sinhalese extremists have vowed to kill 
anyone who supports the accord and have been blamed for at least 
500 deaths since july including members of the governing united 
national party 
the sinhalese also have opposed the merger of the northern and 
eastern provinces saying that while the north is tamildominated 
the eastern province is multiracial 
sinhalese extremists have killed at least 26 people since monday 
in an apparent reaction to the merger announcement 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
the sinhalese make up 75 percent tamils who are mostly hindus 
claim they are discriminated by the mainly buddhist sinhalese who 
control the islands military and government

the senate foreign relations committee on a 10 
to 9 partyline vote today approved and sent to the senate floor 
legislation imposing harsh economic sanctions against 
whitedominated south africa 
immediately after the vote leading senate democrats hailed the 
action as an important step against south africas system of racial 
apartheid and sen edward m kennedy dmass called on republican 
presidential candidate george bush to reverse course and support it 
we would certainly welcome his support on this measure 
kennedy said we have welcomed other electionyear conversions on 
the part of mr bush he has indicated he wanted to broaden his 
mandate he has an excellent opportunity to speak to that issue 
bush has opposed the legislation which would impose a neartotal 
trade embargo against south africa and require the withdrawal of 
all us business investment six months to a year after enactment 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis has supported the 
bills attempt to increase the cost of maintaining apartheid on the 
south african government 
sen alan cranston dcalif a principal author of the 
sanctions bill told reporters that if republicans maintain a solid 
front against the measure it will be difficult to cut off a 
threatened filibuster against it or to override a likely veto by 
president reagan should it be approved 
he said the senates democratic leadership might consider 
attaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some other 
legislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded senate vote 
on sanctions before congress adjourns next month 
the committee vote took place after cranston modified the bill 
to remove a provision that could have caused foreign oil companies 
to lose american oil leases if they acted to undercut the sanctions 
legislation 
opponents of the measure had said they feared the provision 
might cause retaliation by other countries against american oil 
copmpanies especially those active in oil exploration and drilling 
in british territorial waters in the north sea 
sen jesse helms rnc the committees ranking gop member and 
leading opponent of sanctions legislation complained that cranston 
was unfairly violating a committee agreement and moving to change a 
bill helms called a turkey 
its a onelegged turkey that i knew was going to hop around 
but its going nowhere helms said supporters have admitted they 
do not have the votes needed to cut off senate debate and force a 
vote or the votes to override a nearcertain presidential veto if 
it passes 
cranston said he had the right to modify the legislation since 
he sponsored it and said sen helms wants to do nothing to 
improve the bill and nothing to move against apartheid 
the committees 10 democrats voted for the measure and the nine 
republicans against it 
the bill intended as a followup to a set of milder sanctions 
enacted over a reagan veto in 1986 would require an end to most 
trade with south africa and the withdrawal of most us business 
investment from the racially divided nation 
the house approved similar legislation on aug 11 
republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity 
last week to vote on amendments as some gop senators said changes 
might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose 
the 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of 
senators from both parties 
but only a few republicans have indicated they are ready to 
support a stronger set of sanctions with some contending that a 
trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the united 
states may have to encourage pretoria to end the countrys system 
of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid 
they also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would 
foreclose the options of the next president whether he be 
republican george bush who opposes sanctions or democrat michael 
dukakis who favors them 
the state department also opposes the legislation contending 
its passage might disrupt usmediated talks among south africa 
angola and cuba aimed at south african withdrawal from the 
territory of south west africa or namibia and the withdrawal of 
cuban troops from angola 
democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of 
sending a strong signal to south africa that the united states is 
willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system 
they said the issue is a moral one not political and that 
sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent 
revolution inside south africa by moving that country toward 
multiracial democratic rule

scientists today reported finding signs of 
a genetic difference in cells that could help identify people 
likely to become alcoholics 
the researchers are hopeful the discovery may also explain why 
some people become addicted to alcohol and how that can be 
prevented 
studies showed that descendants of white blood cells taken from 
alcoholics adapt to alcohol more quickly than normal cells 
the abnormal response was in the cells production of a 
messenger molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate or camp 
the molecule is used in all cells to relay messages from outside 
the cell to various locations inside 
the researchers previously noted camp abnormalities in the cells 
of actively drinking alcoholics in an effort to find the cause of 
the abnormalities they raised cells from alcoholics for up to six 
generations over seven or eight days without exposing the cells to 
alcohol 
these teetotaler cells showed surprisingly high levels of 
camp three times the level found in descendants of cells taken 
from nonalcoholics 
the researchers also found the cells with the high camp levels 
had an increased sensitivity to alcohol while the progeny of cells 
taken from nonalcoholics showed no significant change 
the discovery took place at the ernest gallo clinic and research 
center at the university of california at san francisco the 
findings are reported in the midseptember issue of the proceedings 
of the national academy of sciences by dr ivan f diamond laura 
e nagy and adrienne gordon 
the evidence of a genetic difference is not conclusive but it 
appears to confirm prior epidemiologic findings that there is a 
genetic component to alcoholism the scientists said 
because the sensitivity could be genetic we now have to go 
out and do genetic studies in families and confirm that this 
increased sensitivity to alcohol is the reason why certain people 
are at risk to become addicted to alcohol said diamond a 
professor of neurology pediatrics and pharmacology at ucsf and 
director of the gallo center 
diamond said that alterations in the camp levels may help 
explain withdrawal symptoms and other problems associated with 
alcoholism 
volunteers in the study included actively drinking alcoholics 
with a lifetime ethanol consumption of at least one ton and 
nonalcoholics drawn from a local mormon church group and 
laboratory staff

five months after lawmakers ousted gov evan 
mecham from office voters have given him a measure of vengeance by 
rejecting seven republican legislators who helped impeach and 
convict him 
we stand at the dawn of a great awakening in arizona mecham 
supporter jerry gillespie said tuesday night after defeating senate 
president carl kunasek in the gop primary by 6548 votes to 5610 
votes the people of this state have begun the process of 
regaining control of their state government 
but the results of the voting hardly constituted a sweep by the 
promecham forces republicans who opposed him had little 
difficulty gaining nomination in areas outside of his traditional 
strongholds of rural arizona and some parts of suburban phoenix 
overall 35 gop legislators faced primary challenges and 27 of 
those advanced to the general election one of the losers was rep 
gary giordano a conservative and a mecham supporter who lost his 
north phoenix seat to a moderate 
tuesdays primary was the first legislative election since the 
republicancontrolled house impeached the ultraconservative mecham 
in february and the gopcontrolled senate convicted him in april of 
obstructing justice and misusing funds that automatically 
installed democrat rose mofford the longtime secretary of state 
in his place until 1990 
among those losing a bid for renomination was house speaker joe 
lane who started the impeachment process last fall mecham backers 
lloyd fenn and warren shumaker captured both gop slots in his 
district 
im not sure next years going to be very much fun for anyone 
down at the legislature lane had said tuesday night as the 
results became clear 
without the impeachment proceedings i believe the speaker and 
the president of the senate would have been reelected mecham 
said wednesday in a telephone interview from his glendale home 
but he also said the real issue in the primary was the 
incumbents votes for higher taxes approved after he was removed 
from office to remedy a budget deficit 
the other casualties were proimpeachment sens peter kay of 
phoenix and jack taylor of mesa along with proimpeachment reps 
bob hungerford of phoenix bob broughton of mesa and don strauch of 
mesa 
its a mecham factor if you ask me taylor said but 
ill tell you if i was asked to vote again tomorrow id vote to 
impeach him 
mecham asked about the implications for his own political 
future replied ive said many times that the result of the 1988 
elections was not a vote on whether i should run in 90 or not 
that decision will be made by me sometime in the middle of next 
year 
in southeastern arizonas 5th congressional district twoterm 
gop incumbent jim kolbe handily defeated his challengers including 
former douglas mayor alberto rodriguez whose nomination for state 
liquor superintendent mecham withdrew when rodriguez came under 
investigation in a decadesold slaying kolbe had 38169 votes or 
78 percent to political newcomer walt webers 5855 votes or 12 
percent rodriguez had 5077 votes or 10 percent

democrat michael dukakis spelled out positions on major weapons 
systems and promised a white house strategy for keeping america 
strong today as a new poll showed republican george bush with 
wide support on defense issues 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen also focused on 
military defense in a speech prepared for delivery in mcallen 
texas under this administration buck rogers has been promoted 
and our conventional forces have been neglected he said in 
the real world real wars are still fought with real tanks and guns 
and fighter planes 
president reagan campaigning for his vice president said in 
remarks prepared for delivery in cape girardeau mo that the 
election gives voters the choice between the policies of 
liberalism or the policies of americas political mainstream 
bush campaigning for hispanic votes at a mexican restaurant in 
los angeles said today they havent begun to see me fight for 
the vote of the hispanicamericans all the way from the east coast 
to the west 
in a pitch on patriotism he said sales of american flags have 
risen since reagan took office in 1981 whereas in the previous 
administration things were rough in the flag business 
dukakis officials released new details of the debate schedule 
saying the presidential contenders would follow their sept 25 
meeting in winstonsalem nc with a debate in los angeles on 
either oct 13 or 14 the vice presidential candidates will debate 
oct 5 in omaha neb 
gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle planned a visit today 
to norad the north american aerospace defense command in colorado 
a new gallup survey indicated bush is leading by an 8point 
margin and dukakis is suffering his highest negative rating of the 
presidential race a cbs newsnew york times poll also showed the 
democratic nominee trailing by 8 points and bush capitalizing on 
defense issues 
a los angeles times nationwide poll released today also showed 
bushs strength on the defense issue among registered voters 
surveyed 54 percent identified bush as the candidate who would 
best ensure a strong defense while only 20 percent answered dukakis 
the democratic presidential nominee used a speech at georgetown 
university in washington today to promise changes that would bring 
order to pentagon priorities after what he said were eight years of 
reagan administration waste and mismanagement 
he endorsed a number of weapons but he also said were not 
going to have a laundry list of weapons systems were going to 
have a strategy for keeping america strong 
dukakis said he was committed to the traditional triad of land 
air and seabased military capability but he said criticized 
bushs defense recommendations and said the vice president has 
failed to discuss the pentagon procurement scandal 
we have what you might call a new type of republican triad 
today waste duplication and fraud he said 
dukakis repeated his promise to make improved conventional 
forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he 
favored rapid development of new tanks and antitank weapons the 
advanced tactical fighter the ss21 sea wolf fastattack submarine 
and new weapons to fight soviet submarines 
he expressed opposition to the proposed railbased mx missile 
and he stated anew his concern that the b1 bomber would be unable 
to perform the job for which it was designed both the mx and the 
b1 are supported by bush 
campaigning in missouri on tuesday bush pledged his support for 
expansion of american markets abroad and suggested that democrats 
are only concerned with production controls similar to the grain 
embargo imposed by former president carter 
they want to control the lives of the farmers the gop 
nominee said 
bush cited a published report that quoted a dukakis aide as 
saying the democratic nominee might reexamine the us policy of 
selling government subsidized wheat to the soviets 
can you imagine another president who leaves open the door of 
using agriculture products to make the political points and using 
our producers in that way he asked 
at the same time the republican party unveiled a new television 
commercial that uses a crime quiz to hit dukakis on the law and 
order issue 
the ad scores the democrat on issues such as the death penalty 
and his states inmate furlough program before an announcer asks 
viewers which candidate for president can you really count on to 
be tough on crime the answer comes george bush 
the bush campaign accepted the resignation of a seventh adviser 
with alleged ties to antisemitic activities hoping for an end to 
the controversy 
radi slavoff quit his post as national cochairman of 
bulgarians for bush following a story in the philadelphia 
inquirer that identified him as former chief of a bulgarian group 
formed after world war ii which consisted of members of the 
nazialigned bulgarian legion 
defense plants are common stops on the gop campaign trail but 
now dukakis has chosen the sites to counter bushs attacks on his 
defense record the two latest polls indicate that dukakis 
approach is a must 
the cbstimes poll which showed bush ahead 4739 percent found 
that 28 percent of the probable voters surveyed believe bush would 
make the nation stronger while only 4 percent said he would weaken 
its defense 
in comparison 39 percent said dukakis would make us defenses 
weaker and 13 percent said stronger 
the poll surveyed 1043 probable voters from thursday through 
sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points 
the gallup poll which found bush leading 4941 percent showed 
that 40 percent have an unfavorable view of dukakis up from 32 
percent last month and the massachusetts governors highest all 
year fiftythree percent gave dukakis a favorable rating 
bush had a 59 percent favorable rating and a 35 percent 
unfavorable 
the gallup survey of 1003 registered voters was done friday 
through sunday and had a 4point margin of error 
the los angeles times poll was conducted over the weekend with 
1105 registered voters dukakis and bush showed 47 percent support 
among the 656 called most likely to vote 
the times poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis today endorsed a long list of weapons sstems he said made 
sense for americas defense and would bring cohesion to pentagon 
priorities after eight years of reagan administration waste and 
mismanagement 
weve got to have leadership in the pentagon that will take 
charge of our defense policy dukakis said in a speech at 
georgetown university and weve got to have a president who will 
keep faith with the men and women we ask to defend freedom and 
liberty around the world 
while endorsing a number of weapons programs dukakis also 
reiterated his opposition to several favored by reagan and 
republican presidential nominee george bush including the 
railbased mx missile and he expressed anew his concern that the 
b1 bomber would be unable to perform the job for which it was 
designed 
dukakis said he favored continued research on a strategic 
defense system but at about 1 billion a year far below what 
reagan wants to spend on the socalled star wars system dukakis 
also said that while he agreed in concept with the midgetman 
missile he was not convinced the costly program was needed to 
modernize the landbased us nuclear deterrent 
dukakis repeated his promise to make improved conventional 
forces his top defense priority if he is elected and said he 
favored rapid development of new tanks and antitank weapons the 
advanced tactical fighter the ss21 sea wolf fastattack submarine 
and new weapons to fight soviet submarines 
he also reiterated his backing of the trident ii submarinebased 
missile system the stealth bomber and advanced cruise missiles 
were not going to have a laundry list of weapons systems 
dukakis said were going to have a strategy for keeping america 
strong 
later at a rally in annapolis md before heading home to 
boston the democratic nominee taunted bush for refusing to agree 
to a presidential debate originally scheduled for tonight in the 
maryland capital 
if george bush isnt ready today after more than seven and a 
half years as vice president of this country how can we expect him 
to be ready on jan 20 1989 dukakis asked lloyd bentsen and 
i are ready 
he jokingly suggested that the reason bush refused to come to 
the home of the us naval academy was that his idea of a naval 
exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard that was a 
reference to the recent resignation of six officials of a probush 
ethnic campaign organization who allegedly had pronazi or 
antisemitic ties 
at georgetown university dukakis accused bush of playing 
politics by convincing reagan to veto a defense authorization bill 
recently passed with bipartisan support in congress and said the 
veto had prevented an expanded role for the coast guard in the war 
on drugs and longoverdue pay and benefit increases for military 
forces 
my friends we cant play politics with our national 
security dukakis said 
he promised to work diligently toward new arms control measures 
and a nuclear test ban treaty with the soviet union but also said 
he would demand significant cutbacks in soviet conventional forces 
in europe and call for the dismantling of the soviets ss18 
missiles 
despite spending billions on defense dukakis said the reagan 
administration has done little to improve the nations security 
the fact is that the republicans promised in 1980 to make our 
landbased missiles invulnerable and today after another 25 
billion and eight years of republican mismanagement our icbms are 
more vulnerable that they were in 1980 
dukakis said he was committed to the traditional triad of us 
defense policy land air and seabased strategic capacities but 
he said bush had shown no cohesion in his priorities and has failed 
to discuss the pentagon procurement scandal 
we have what you might call a new type of republican triad 
today waste duplication and fraud he said 
dukakis also said that as commanderinchief he would not shy 
away from using military force if necessary 
well use force when its necessary to protect our territory 
our citizens or vital interests to meet our treaty commitments 
and to deter or respond to terrorist attacks he said

an armed man who barricaded himself in 
a house for more than 30 hours convinced the world was coming to 
an end as prophesied in a religious booklet was overpowered by 
police and arrested today authorities said 
ricky odell chavis 27 fired shots at passing motorists and a 
police officer but no one was injured police said 
he was messed up real bad on religion said chavis aunt 
joy cassell 
she said two doortodoor missionaries for the jehovahs witness 
sect apparently convinced her nephew he needed to get right 
because tuesday would be the day that god called true believers to 
heaven 
edgar c whisenant predicted in his booklet 88 reasons why the 
rapture will be in 1988 that jesus would rapture the church 
and take the faithful to heaven by sunset tuesday 
whisenant said tuesday he still believed the rapture was 
imminent and revised the moment to 1055 am edt today that 
deadline passed without apparent incident 
chavis was arrested after negotiators got him to step outside 
his back door shortly after 2 am today said police dispatcher 
susan garinger sheriffs deputies then lobbed concussion grenades 
at chavis stunning him she said 
chavis was charged with assaulting a police officer with a 
deadly weapon and terrorizing the public 
few preachers seemed to take the whisenant book seriously 
there are maybe a few concerned theres a lot of interest 
said the rev richard d white pastor of the 2000member first 
baptist church in franklin tenn 
we have difficulty with the book the scripture is very clear 
that thats not something known to man its known only to god 
others said it didnt matter that the predictions were wrong 
my awareness has been quickened and ill never be the same 
said helaine parker of mount juliet tenn if people mock us im 
still happy because mockers are another biblical prophecy that will 
come true in the last days 
a duke university theologian said he wont be surprised if there 
are more predictions of a second coming 
every time they predict and it doesnt come to pass they 
dont get embarrassed by that they just reload and they say we 
miscalculated said james efird professor of biblical 
interpretation at dukes divinity school 
about 1 million copies of the book have been circulated 
throughout the nation with about twothirds sold for 2 and the 
rest given away said the rev bob doom who runs a christian

the government wednesday issued a 
formal protest to israel over the 1948 slaying of un mediator 
folke bernadotte by the jewish underground stern gang a former 
member said the killing was justified 
israels ambassador to sweden was called to the foreign office 
and handed a note expressing the governments shock 
dissatisfaction and indignation that israel has not reacted after 
the new reports about the murder a foreign office spokesman said 
in interviews broadcast and published over the weekend members 
of the nowdefunct israel freedom fighters also known as the stern 
gang acknowledged they were involved in the shooting death of 
bernadotte on sept 17 1948 
they said bernadotte a swedish count who was on a un mission 
in palestine was slain because of his plan to give the united 
nations control over jerusalem and hand over key areas to the 
arabs the group was a splinter faction of the rightwing national 
military organization 
since the slaying the group has been widely believed to be 
responsible but the killers were never found despite a widespread 
manhunt 
ambassador moshe erell told reporters after the meeting 
wednesday that israel expressed its regrets immediately after the 
slaying and had not changed its position national radio reported 
he made no comments during the meeting with ambassador torsten 
ohrn head of the foreign office political section the radio 
reported 
in 1945 bernadotte led an international red cross operation 
that rescued 30000 concentration camp victims from germany and 
resettled them in sweden 
yisrael scheibeldad a former member of the stern gang told 
israel radio wednesday the killing prevented a disaster for 
jerusalem and the state of israel 
im not saying every assassination is good but this one was 
good i want to state that 40 years later an act of individual 
terror can be good and bad in this case it was good said 
eldad who has not claimed to be involved in the slaying 
the underground group was named after leader avraham stern who 
was killed by british police in 1942 the group then was jointly 
headed by eldad the late natan yellinmor and yitzhak shamir who 
is now israels prime minister 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir has denied the premier was 
involved in the killing and contended the group was officially 
disbanded about four months before bernadottes death

the sunday school lesson that morning 25 
years ago was on forgiving love but racial hatred that had gripped 
birmingham for months erupted in a dynamite explosion that tore 
into the church and killed four black girls 
the blast at the 16th street baptist church on sept 15 1963 
seared the conscience of alabamas largest city which had become 
known as a segregationist battleground and helped bring to it a 
quartercentury of change 
the bombing which is to be marked in a service thursday night 
came at a time when some city leaders already were trying to find a 
way toward racial harmony 
less than a year earlier the city government had been 
reorganized to replace the powerful threemember commission with a 
ninemember city council one of those commissioners eugene 
bull connor had gained national notoriety when he ordered that 
dogs and fire hoses be used against civil rights demonstrators 
the bombing followed a series of blasts that had occurred since 
the 1950s although no one had died in the earlier explosions 
the church near the local office of martin luther kings 
southern christian leadership conference was often used for 
rallies by blacks seeking changes in what king had called the most 
segregated city in the country 
the rev john cross pastor of the church at the time said at 
least three bomb threats had been made before the bombing 
prompting allnight watches at the church for a while 
we had just about relaxed the protection of the church he 
said it looked like everything was working with ease we thought 
peace would prevail 
jl lowe who directed the church orchestra said church 
members said surely nobodys going to bomb the church while there 
are inhabitants 
but at about 1020 am sunday sept 15 an explosion tore 
apart the side entrance to the building a bomb had been placed 
beneath concrete steps near the window of a basement restroom 
addie mae collins cynthia dianne wesley and carole robertson 
all 14 and denise mcnair 11 were in the restroom preparing for a 
special youth program they were killed and two other girls were 
injured 
king himself later the victim of an assassins bullet preached 
at the combined funeral of three of the blast victims 
the deaths touched off donations from around the country that 
totaled 500000 money used for the funerals and for repairs to 
the church 
fourteen years later a jury convicted robert edward chambliss 
a retired automobile mechanic and ku klux klansman in the death of 
miss mcnair whose father chris mcnair now is a jefferson county 
commissioner chambliss died in prison in 1985 after serving eight 
years of a life sentence for murder 
today the only reminders of the blast at the 16th street 
baptist church are a plaque and memorial nook downstairs and 
another memorial in the sanctuary with pictures of the four girls 
if the bombing was meant to stop or deter the civil rights 
movement it did not said the rev fred shuttlesworth a founder 
of the movement in birmingham and now a pastor in cincinnati 
we pick up the pieces we bury our dead but we keep our 
faith and keep on moving i think these things do more solidifying 
and bring about more determination than if they did not happen 
today richard arrington is in his third term as birminghams 
first black mayor the city council has six blacks and three 
whites and long gone are the whites only signs at drinking 
fountains bus stations and restaurants 
after the explosion cross whose 4yearold daughter was cut on 
the forehead by flying glass appealed to a crowd gathered in the 
street to go home and pray 
god forgive them for they know not what they do he said 
the sunday lesson that morning cross said had been about a 
love that forgives thats what we really had to practice for the 
next several weeks and months and years and even now

the land heaved and windows broke 
more than two miles away wednesday when the soviet union detonated 
a underground nuclear bomb for the first american experts to 
witness a soviet nuclear blast 
the americans stood in a chilly wind on the barren test site at 
the forward command post semipalatinsk polygon about 1700 miles 
southeast of moscow in the republic of kazakhstan 
the wind blew the soviet and american flags in the direction of 
the test range far from the nearest settlement on the steppes of 
soviet central asia and a fourhour bus ride from the city of 
semipalatinsk 
as the shock wave rippled out the ground shook and a low rumble 
began within moments of the 11 am blast a reddish dust cloud 
rolled above the spot where soviet scientists planted a nuclear 
device in a shaft drilled 642 yards into hard rock 
some observers seemed a bit queezy from their proximity to 
ground zero only 24 miles away soviet observers watching a 
similar test on aug 17 in pahute mesa nev remained about 30 
miles from the blast site too far away to feel the impact it was 
the first time soviet experts were allowed to see a us nuclear 
test and monitor it with their own equipment 
after wednesdays test the soviet scientists quickly checked 
their instruments and announced they had obtained the data 
necessary to determine the force of the blast 
the information was gathered in a few millionths of a second 
before the explosion destroyed the sensor cable buried a few yards 
from the nuclear device the soviets and the americans who 
monitored the blast with us technology have agreed to release 
the data within a month 
the blast was designed to have a force of 100 to 150 kilotons 
about 10 times that of the atomic bomb the americans dropped on 
hiroshima japan at the end of world war ii but less powerful 
than the multimegaton hydrogen bombs detonated in the atmosphere at 
the height of nuclear testing in the 1960s 
the hagfors observatory of the swedish defense research 
establishment said the semipalatinsk explosion measured between 50 
and 150 kilotons 
the joint experiment was the culmination of a dream for many 
experts who have spent their careers watching and studying their 
counterparts from a distance said c paul robinson the chief 
us negotiator at the geneva talks on limiting nuclear tests 
we are extremely pleased said deputy us energy secretary 
joseph salgado solgado the experiment went very well for both 
sides 
igor m palenykh head of the soviet observation team said 
if the americans had any doubt about our level of science and 
technology in a nuclear field now they know 
both sides expressed confidence the test explosion would lead to 
ratification of treaties limiting the size of underground nuclear 
blasts 
at a news conference in a trailer village that served as the 
command post for the test salgado said wednesdays experiment and 
the one like it in nevada have demonstrated the effectiveness and 
nonintrusiveness of corrtex the us technology developed to 
gauge the force of nuclear explosions 
the soviets however remain sceptical that the us onsite 
measuring system offers a longterm solution to the problem of 
verifying nuclear tests 
lt gen arkady d ilyenko chief of the semipalatinsk test 
site said it was too early to determine whether the american 
method was nonintrusive meaning it does not interfere with the 
blast or pick up other data the country doing the testing would 
like to keep secret 
ilyenko called for a continuing search for simpler more precise 
measuring techniques 
spokesmen for both sides agreed the experiments will speed 
negotiations in geneva on verification protocols needed to ratify 
two treaties signed but not ratified in the 1970s that limit the 
force of underground nuclear explosions robinson said the us 
side still hopes the treaties can be ratified before president 
reagans term ends jan 20 1989 
the treaties limit underground nuclear test explosions to a 
strength of 150 kilotons 
the two superpowers say they will abide by the agreements but 
the united states has said it will not ratify the documents until 
adequate provisions are included against cheating and monitoring 
techniques both sides could use to measure tests and verify 
compliance according to robinson 
the talks on nuclear testing began in july 1986 and formal 
negotiations started last november 
 
the soviets support a complete ban on nuclear testing 
washington says the tests are necessary as long as nuclear weapons 
exist but want the number of nuclear explosions reduced in tandem 
with arms stockpiles

democrat michael dukakis under republican 
attack as weak on defense came on like a hawk wednesday citing a 
range of weapons systems he supports and accusing his opponents of 
a smoke and mirrors military policy 
well use force when its necessary to protect our territory 
our citizens or our vital interests to meet our treaty commitments 
and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks the democratic 
presidential nominee said in a speech at georgetown university 
portrayed by republicans george bush and dan quayle as an 
opponent of most major weapons systems dukakis countered by 
describing the nations military as suffering from years of neglect 
during the reagan administration 
dukakis said there are shortages of tanks and antitank weapons 
and carrier aircraft and he said a backlog of undone essential 
maintenance work in the army and air force is greater now than it 
was when this administration took office 
he also said there was a shortage of medical personnel 
dukakis said he would press ahead with development of the 
advanced tactical fighter and the sea wolf attack submarine if 
elected he also criticized the administration for decommissioning 
16 navy frigates 
the massachusetts governor said democrats and republicans alike 
have the job of defending freedom and added 
george bush unfortunately forgot that lesson last month when 
he persuaded the president to veto the defense bill over the 
objections of the secretary of defense and the national security 
adviser mr bushs pollster apparently had more influence than 
they did 
president reagan complained at the time that the bill cut too 
much into star wars funding and contained democraticwritten 
armscontrol provisions 
in what has become a daily jab at the gop vice presidential 
nominee dukakis said im not going to be looking for guidance 
on national security issues from j danforth quayle 
later at an annapolis md rally before he headed home to 
boston the democratic nominee taunted bush for refusing to agree 
to a debate originally scheduled for wednesday night in the 
maryland capital 
if george bush isnt ready today after more than seven and a 
half years as vice president of this country how can we expect him 
to be ready on january 20 1989 dukakis asked lloyd bentsen 
and i are ready 
he also took a poke at the vice president for the recent 
resignations of six campaign advisers on ethnic voters because of 
allegations that they had pronazi or antisemitic ties 
maybe the reason george bush wont come here to annapolis 
home of the us naval academy is that his idea of a naval 
exercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard dukakis 
said 
at georgetown the candidate was introduced by rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee who said 
the defense budget into the 1990s would be flat at best he 
said the next president would have to maintain a strong defense 
in the face of restrained dollars 
also seated on the stage was sen sam nunn dga chairman of 
the senate armed services committee 
responding to the republican attacks dukakis said weve had 
a lot of nonsense lately from mr bush on the subject of national 
defense 
the massachusetts governor said that the trident ii missile 
program and development of the stealth bomber were started under 
democratic president jimmy carter 
he said that reagan took office in 1981 with a promise to make 
us landbased missiles invulnerable to soviet attack 
but he said that after eight years of republican 
mismanagement our icbms are more vulnerable than they were in 
1980 
its time for an end to republican smoke and mirrors on 
national defense he said calling the mx missile which he 
opposes a sitting duck 
dukakis also opposes the proposed midgetman missile a 
singlewarhead weapon favored by some as an alternative to the 
multiwarhead mx 
but in this speech he tempered his opposition to midgetman 
saying the strategic concept of the midegetman is sound but i 
question the value of spen 
 
 
 
ding 40 billion or 50 billion for 500 additional landbased 
missile warheads at three times the cost of the same number of 
new submarinebased warheads both aspin and nunn support the 
missile 
while seeking to clarify his own position on star wars the 
spacebased missile defense system being pushed by the 
administration dukakis accused bush of waffling 
im beinning to get the feeling that one of the reasons mr 
bush is so reluctant to debate me is that hes so busy debating 
himself he said one day he wants to speed up sdi strategic 
defense initiative the next day he does not 
dukakis once counted a staunch opponent of sdi has said he 
would continue research and recently also said he would deploy it 
if it were deemed essential to the national interest 
at georgetown he made no mention of deployment instead he 
said if were going to make our defense dollars count weve got 
to stop pouring billions and billions into this program and do some 
hard thinking about what were trying to achieve 
he said that rather than scrap the antiballistic missile treaty 
as some administration officials have suggested i will protect 
american security by insisting that the soviets live up to it 
and that they dismantle the krasnoyarsk radar administration 
officials have called the radar a violation of the treaty

a swedish doctor who has transplanted brain 
cells from aborted human fetuses to patients with parkinsons 
disease said wednesday the procedure is so promising it would be 
unethical not to make it available to desperately ill people 
dr lars olson professor of neurobiology at karolinska 
institute in stockholm and one of the few people in the world to 
have transplanted human fetal tissue also told a national 
institutes of health advisory committee the technique has been used 
in mexico china england and cuba 
there are no known cases of fetal tissue being transplanted as a 
treatment for parkinsons disease in the united states but several 
animal studies have suggested the procedure can be effective 
eugene redmond jr professor of psychiatry at yale university 
school of medicine outlined his work with green monkeys with a 
video tape he showed remarkable improvement in monkeys in which 
parkinsons was induced and then treated with brain cells taken 
from healthy monkeys 
one of the questions the committee specifically has been asked 
to answer is whether animal studies have been numerous and 
successful enough to warrant going forward with similar 
experimental treatment on humans 
when one of the panel members directed that question to olson 
he replied the animal data are so promising we have 
approached a point where i believe it is unethical not to do this 
in human studies 
the special nih advisory committee was appointed at the 
direction of dr robert e windom the federal governments 
assistant secretary for health after he denied permission for nih 
scientists to proceed with human fetal tissue transplants without 
formal consideration of moral and ethical questions raised by the 
emerging field of research 
even before the group could hold its first meeting however it 
was learned last week that a white house official has drafted a 
proposed executive order that would ban all such research 
most of the opposition comes from people and organizations 
opposed to abortion in general they maintain that allowing such 
research could encourage more abortions 
the advisory committee devoted its first daylong session to 
scientific issues and will turn to legal and ethical considerations 
thursday before draftings its recommendations on friday 
the matter then goes to a standing nih advisory committee dec 1 
for final recommendations to nih director james b wyngaarden 
despite the focus on presentations by some of the nations top 
researchers who say fetal tissue transplants hold potential for 
treating diabetes alzheimers and many other diseases it was 
clear the scientists and doctors were well aware of ethical 
considerations 
for example there have been instances of women in the united 
states expressing a desire to become pregnant just to produce a 
fetus that would be aborted to treat a relative with parkinsons 
disease 
there are rumors that this has been done in east germany 
said thomas j gill iii chairman of the pathology department at 
the university of pittsburgh school of medicine i think this is 
ethically unacceptable 
olson made no claims of dramatic improvements for the two 
patients he implanted with fetal brain cells eight months ago 
there have been no adverse effects he said it appears 
that we are seeing minor positive changes in the patients 
he pointed out that both patients women in their 50s have been 
suffering from severe parkinsons for 15 years and he was 
optimistic that the marginal improvement seen so far will intensify 
as the implanted brain cells mature 
parkinsons which causes a loss of muscle control is caused by 
a shortage of cells that produce a brain chemical called dopamine 
it is these dopamineproducing cells that are transplanted from 
fetuses

american rice farmers complained wednesday 
that their crops are being frozen out of the japanese market and 
asked for government help including trade retaliation if needed 
the time has come for the government of japan to take the 
steps necessary for us to compete in our market sen david 
pryor dark told a news conference at which the action was 
announced 
groups representing rice producers and millers asked us trade 
representative clayton k yeutter for assistance on grounds that 
japanese refusal to permit rice imports amounts to an unfair trade 
barrier 
yeutter has 45 days to decide whether to take the case if he 
did so the next step would be to engage in talks with the japanese 
if that failed the government would seek relief under the 
97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt failure to 
get results after two years of gatt negotiations would require 
retaliation under the new trade law approved by congress and signed 
by president reagan this summer 
japan is the american farmers best customer it bought more 
than 55 billion worth of us agricultural products last year and 
is expected to account for 69 billion in purchases this year 
more than any other country 
many of these goods such as corn are not grown in quantity in 
japan it has imported only a tiny trickle of rice maintaining 
restraints in an effort to protect its farmers from foreign 
competition 
california texas and other american producers engaging in 
hightech largescale farming can grow rice at far below the 
costs of japanese counterparts and if all trade restraints were 
swept away could be expected to command a substantial share of the 
japanese market in short order 
industry officials said rice priced at 300 a ton in the united 
states would cost 2500 in japan 
they told the news conference however they have no intention 
of trying to wipe out japanese rice farming 
we are not looking for an opportunity to flood the japanese 
market said j stephen gabbert president of the rice millers 
association the group filed the trade petition in a joint effort 
with the rice council for market development a growers group 
the petition seeks to gain 25 percent of the japanese rice 
market in the first of a fouryear phasein and expand to 10 
percent or 1 million tons by the fourth year 
senators from riceproducing states were on hand to push the 
petition with sen pete wilson rcalif declaring that the 
industry had tried to get the japanese to import american rice 
voluntarily 
as always the response has been a virtual stone wall said 
wilson and that is not good enough

president reagan campaigning for his 
vice president george bush blamed democrats wednesday for 
economic and foreign policy nightmares 
reagan praised his own record in office during a speech prepared 
for a campaign rally at southeast missouri state university and he 
envisioned a return to high inflation and other economic problems 
as well as a loss of american prestige if the democrats win in 
november 
america has traveled such a remarkable distance in the last 
eight years that the memory has faded of the economic and foreign 
policy crises that we faced when vice president bush and i took 
office he said in the latest in a series of outoftown forays 
reagan will make to promote bush and republican candidates for 
congress 
the truth is that when you take a walk down our oppositions 
memory lane it starts to look like nightmare on elm street he 
said 
reagan who won roughly 60 percent of the popular vote in 
missouri in his race against democrat walter f mondale was 
traveling later in the day to st louis to speak at a 250aplate 
fundraising dinner white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the expenses for the trip from washington were being paid by the 
state and national republican parties 
in his speech reagan brought back a familiar refrain that 
democratic party leaders harbor gloomanddoom views of americas 
future in the world although he never mentioned the name of 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
he did say that in 1979 the nation was facing doubledigit 
inflation and interest rates at home while being faced with the 
seizure of the american embassy in tehran iran and the soviet 
incursion into afghanistan 
dont we have the right to ask the american people if the 
liberals return to power what happens in 1989 he asked 
when the american people saw that under the other fellows the 
economic misery index was soaring off the charts they wanted a 
change and who did they call george bush and me the 
malaisebusters 
fitzwater told reporters that during the flight from washington 
that the president decided not to use the malaisebusters 
phrase because he said he was just uncomfortable with the 
language 
reagan hailed the commerce departments report wednesday that 
the us merchandise trade deficit fell in july to 95 billion 
the lowest level since december 1984 
when america goes into the market to compete we plan to 
win he said others may talk but we deliver 
today we have peace and prosperity reagan said and the 
liberals are trying to pretend those economic and foreign policy 
nightmares they gave us never happened 
several state republicans including gov john ashcroft hoped 
to benefit from reagans fundraising appearances ashcroft is 
seeking a second term against democratic state rep betty hearnes 
of charleston the wife of former gov william hearnes 
sen john danforth rmo is opposed by state sen jay nixon of 
hillsboro as danforth seeks his third term

<TEXT>
that they are stifling competition in the air travel industry a 
congressional report said wednesday 
the study concluded that the reservation systems are generating 
profits exceeding those that could reasonably be expected to be 
earned in a competitive market 
it also chided the department of transportation for failing to 
take steps to eliminate the anticompetitive features of the 
computer reservation industry 
dot has a statutory responsibility to protect competition in 
the airline industry said the report which was written by the 
general accounting office congress nonpartisan investigative 
agency 
the computer systems whic budget deficit brady praised both the 
administration and congress for their efforts which have whittled 
the deficit from 220 billion in 1986 to an estimated 150 billion 
this year 
i do think we can grow our way out of this he said adding 
at another point i see no reason at this moment why taxes have 
to be raised 
sen max baucus dmont urged brady to offer more than 
platitudes on the budget brady declined to recommend 
specifics but promised to present congress with new ideas for 
reducing the deficit by the end of the year 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the chairman of the finance 
committee and the democratic vice presidential candidate gave 
brady a warm endorsement even though brady is a close adviser to 
bush 
nick brady is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion 
is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary bentsen 
said its a big job a tough job but youre used to tough 
jobs 
in his latest government assignment brady headed a presidential 
task force that studied the causes of the october stock market 
crash his report called for greater regulation over some aspects 
of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the 
administration 
brady said market reforms put in place since the crash have been 
on the right track declining to criticize the administration 
for not doing everything his commission advised 
im not sure we were 100 percent right we did our work in 60 
days he said 
on another matter brady said federal savings and loan 
regulators have as much as they can spend for now on sampl rescues 
and he said he saw no reason for now for a taxpayer bailout of 
the industry

a united airlines dc10 that skidded off a runway 
at stapleton international airport may have experienced steering 
problems before the accident occurred a federal aviation official 
said 
one person out of the 207 aboard suffered minor injuries in 
mondays mishap 
the pilot had some problems with the steering he went off the 
runway and they evacuated said bob shelton a spokesman for the 
federal aviation administrations regional office in denver 
they did have some steering problems the nose tire did 
show some chafing which meant it was sliding which usually 
indicates a steering problem like youre dragging it sideways 
across the pavement he said 
pilots who witnessed the incident said the pilot apparently 
overshot the runway landing area touching down 4000 to 5000 feet 
from the start of the runway instead of within the 3000 feet 
required by faa regulations 
federal records also showed that the plane had problems with its 
landing gear three times this summer 
tracks left by the jetliners tires indicate that it veered from 
the rainwet runway on a highspeed taxiway about 1000 feet down 
from the touchdown point 
after it landed the plane traveled nearly 2000 feet on grass 
and dirt beside the 10000footlong runway and bumped over two 
taxiway crossings its nose landing gear collapsed near a third 
taxiway crossing said stapleton spokesman norm avery 
loren steiner president of golden eagle charter and a licensed 
air transport pilot watched the plane touch down from his office 
near the runway 
the pilot he said was at the normal altitude and speed for 
landing but he was too far down the runway there was a lot of 
black smoke and debris flying it may be that he blew a tire then 
in two previous incidents involving the landing gear crews 
flying the plane reported that nosewheel warning lights went off 
as the aircraft was preparing to land the faa said on a third 
occasion warning lights for all three of the planes landing gear 
illuminated as the aircraft took off 
in each instance the problem was corrected and no accident 
occurred the faa reported 
although the cause of the accident is still under investigation 
united airlines spokesman joe hopkins said the airline concluded 
the type of problems reported on the landing gear earlier could not 
have been a factor

the savings and loan where maria desillers kept 
some donations for her sons medical care should have frozen the 
funds after the boy died the estates curator contends in court 
documents 
nearly 690000 including 1000 from president reagan was 
donated to pay for liver transplants for 7yearold ronnie who 
died in april 1987 while awaiting his fourth liver transplant at 
pittsburghs childrens hospital 
after his death coral gables federal savings and loan did not 
block ms desillers from withdrawing of some 200000 which 
legally belonged to the boys estate curator karen gievers alleged 
in motions filed tuesday with dade county probate court 
with the widespread national media attention that ronnie got 
the savings and loan should have realized that he had died ms 
gievers said 
ms gievers said her motions asked for court permission to bring 
a lawsuit against the savings and loan over the issue a hearing 
was scheduled friday before probate judge francis christie 
karl steene director of marketing for coral gables federal 
declined to comment tuesday 
ms desillers and her attorney frank johnson did not return 
phone messages seeking comment in the past the have contended 
that she had the right to the money because some of the donations 
were intended just for her personal expenses 
the money withdrawn by ms desillers was used to buy a used bmw 
for 13500 jewelry clothing and other items christie signed a 
court order last month authorizing the seizure of disputed 
property the car was seized but the other items have not yet been 
taken 
money used to buy the car and the value of other property and 
assets recovered during the ongoing legal battle will be deducted 
from the amount ms gievers hopes to obtain from coral gables 
federal 
if coral gables federal is forced to pay the difference to 
ronnies estate the savings and loan could in turn sue ms 
desillers the curator said

a ransom of 222 million may have 
been paid to release a west german hostage despite a round of 
denials from his employer and government officials a newspaper 
reported wednesday 
the hamburgbased masscirulation daily bild said the money was 
deposited into arabian bank accounts to secure the freedom of 
rudolf cordes who arrived home tuesday night after 20 months of 
captivity 
cordes 55 beirut manager for the hoechst ag pharmaceutical 
company was released by his proiranian shiite moslem kidnappers 
late monday night he was first taken to damascus syria 
wolfgang schaeuble who heads the federal governments middle 
east crisis group strongly denied that money was paid for cordes 
release 
there were no deals there were no conditions said 
schaeuble 
the release was secured through talks and the help of iranian 
and syrian officials he said echoing earlier comments by 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and chancellor helmut kohl 
schaeuble also said the government made no concessions in the 
case of mohammed ali hamadi who is on trial in frankfurt on 
charges of murder and air piracy in the 1985 hijacking of a twa 
jetliner 
justice minister hans engelhard also said the government from 
the first moment on made it clear that there would be no deals no 
release in exchange for the west german hostages 
cordes and another west german alfred schmidt were kidnapped 
in beirut in january 1987 after hamadi was arrested at frankfurt 
airport 
schmidt was released on sept 7 1987 
hamadis older brother abbas was convicted by a duesseldorf 
court for his role in the kidnappings which were designed to 
pressure the government into releasing mohammed hamadi 
but bild citing unidentified security sources strongly 
suggested a ransom was paid 
despite all denials by the west german government and the 
hoechst company a sum of millions is believed to have been paid to 
kidnappers for the release bild said 
the newspaper quoted a source identified only as a security 
expert as saying that millions of dollars were paid for cordes 
release 
such money is paid discreetly via front men into arabian bank 
accounts bild quoted a security expert as saying in 
cordes case there has been talk of at least 40 million marks 
222 million 
the newspaper is known to have good sources within the 
government in bonn 
the frankfurtbased hoechst company also denied that any money 
was paid and declared as false a magazine report that it had hired 
a private detective to deliver the money 
hoechst spokeswoman felicitas feick said our company had 
nothing to do with this man no money was paid for mr cordes 
release 
the hamburgbased stern magazine in a telex to news media said 
a man it identified as werner mauss was hired by the company to 
conduct negotiations and deliver money to the hijackers 
after his arrival at colognebonn airport tuesday cordes was 
immediately flown to an undisclosed location he remained in 
seclusion wednesday 
schaeuble told west german television that cordes was weak but 
in good health he said cordes told him that he was kept isolated 
and chained during most of his captivity 
he was moved often and was in a continuous state of 
uncertainty he told me he received few letters from his 
relatives schaeuble said 
cordes was the last west german hostage in lebanon where 17 
other foreigners are held captive the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
anderson was kidnapped march 16 1985

acting treasury secretary m peter mcpherson 
spoke out strongly wednesday for ending third world trade 
concessions that he said perpetuate poverty instead of promoting 
growth 
less developed countries can gain much more by negotiating as 
true trade partners than as special pleaders in trade talks 
he said in a speech to the american enterprise institute a 
business and public policy research organization 
mcpherson attacked the reliance of developing countries on 
waivers of international trade rules allowing them to use import 
substitution and nonreciprocity policies to protect infant 
industries 
he said that during the current uruguay round of world trade 
negotiations the united states will step up opposition to 
special and differential treatment for such countries under the 
rules of gatt the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the uruguay round launched at the 1986 world economic 
conference at punta del este uruguay is scheduled for a review 
session in december at montreal 
import substitution amounts to protection and the old theory 
that trade protection promotes development is bankrupt yet gatt 
still echoes this theory mcpherson said 
the accumulation of special exemptions and arrangements for 
developing countries through gatts history has effectively removed 
less developed countries from obligations under gatt principles of 
nondiscrimination transparency and reciprocity he asserted 
a 1955 gatt decision allowing poor countries with balance of 
payments bop problems to restrict imports temporarily has been 
misused to the point that the bop waiver is used to provide 
lasting cover for import substitution policies he said some 
of those quotas have been in place for decades 
rather than a strategy for economic development import 
substitution is a strategy for economic decline mcpherson 
asserted he said the concessions promote inwardlooking policies 
that reduce export capacity worsen balance of payments and income 
distribution and depress wages 
not only the free trade citystates of singapore and hong kong 
but also turkey and mexico are examples of economies that have 
prospered under outwardoriented trade policies mcpherson said 
after it reversed course and began to liberalize trade in 
1980 turkeys annual rises in export growth jumped from 55 
percent to almost 20 per cent he said no economy not even 
taiwan has performed better turkish manufactured goods 2 
percent of exports in 1965 account for 56 percent today he said

a military judge wednesday denied a 
defense motion to dismiss all charges against a navy rescueswimmer 
instructor standing courtmartial for the drowning of a teenage 
recruit 
cmdr newell d krogmann gave no explanation for his ruling in 
the case of petty officer 2nd class michael combe accused of 
involuntary manslaughter battery and conspiracy to commit battery 
in the death of airman recruit lee mirecki 
the 19yearold trainee from appleton wis drown march 2 in a 
training pool at pensacola naval air station 
marine capt james royce one of the lawyers for the 28yearold 
defendant from tempe ariz contended the prosecution which 
rested tuesday had presented insufficient evidence to prove his 
clients guilt 
combe helped other instructors toss mirecki back into the pool 
after the panicked recruit climbed out and tried to quit the 
voluntary training and then forced the victims head under water 
prosecution witnesses have testified 
royce argued that combe and other instructors adhered to what 
they considered normal procedures in dealing with an unwilling 
trainee 
you cannot have a conspiracy to commit what you believe to be 
a lawful act royce said 
but the lead prosecutor lt cmdr larry wynne argued the 
instructors actions were illegal 
on the involuntary manslaughter charge royce contended there 
was no culpable negligence because combe didnt know mirecki had a 
phobia about being dragged under water and couldnt have 
anticipated it would cause him to have a heart attack a navy 
pathologist testified the phobia triggered fearinduced heart 
failure that led to his drowning 
combe should have expected the possibility of death resulting 
from his actions because another recruit had passed out from 
similar treatment at combes hands last year wynne said 
royce also argued that evidence failed to show mirecki was 
touched against his will a necessary finding for a battery 
conviction 
witnesses had testified mirecki shouted he wanted to quit and 
was trying to get away before combe grabbed him in a head hold and 
dunked him

the state department said wednesday it has 
evidence that libya has acquired a chemical weapons production 
capability and is on the verge of a fullscale production effort 
department spokesman charles redman called this a particularly 
worrisome development in light of libyas record of 
statesponsored terrorism in many global troublespots 
he said the kinds of chemicals that are useful in producing 
chemical weapons are available on the world market he called on 
nations that may be making contributions to the libyan program to 
halt such activity 
redman said the united states has been investigating the matter 
for some time but substantiated the alleged libyan activities only 
recently he provided no information on type of weapons libya is 
developing nor did he say how us officials learned of the 
operations 
his statement came less than a week after he accused iraq of 
using chemical weapons against kurdish rebels in defiance of a 1925 
international protocol barring use of such weapons 
he said wednesday that the use of chemical weapons by both iran 
and iraq had set a dangerous precedent for the middle east as a 
whole 
redman noted that there were reports last year that libya had 
used chemical weapons in its war with chad 
we also have the general record of irresponsible behavior on 
the part of libyan leader moammar gadhafi he said i think 
in the end this is yet another indication of why the world 
community needs to take vigorous action to curb the illicit use of 
chemical weapons and their further proliferation he added

but the lawyer for the trio who were jailed up to 21 months 
without trial said he received no official word of the 
governments stance and gave no indication what his clients planned 
to do 
foreign minister pik botha said the three were not in any 
danger of being arrested once they leave the consulate police 
said they would have to issue new orders to detain the men again 
but that they have no plans to do so 
the activists slipped away from their police guards tuesday 
while undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital and made their way to 
the consulate in a downtown office building 
we sought refuge in the us consulate because we failed to 
see any justification for our continued detention without trial 
the three said in the statement we have now resorted to the only 
dignified response to our continued incarceration 
the escapees are murphy morobe acting publicity secretary of 
the banned united democratic front mohammed valli moosa the 
fronts acting general secretary and vusi khanyile chairman of 
the banned national education crisis committee 
morobe detained without trial since july 1987 and khanyile 
detained since december 1986 are black valli moosa an indian

the trio in a statement released by their lawyer krish naidoo 
called for an end to the 27month state of emergency and demanded 
the right to walk out of this consulate free of any restrictions 
or the threat of redetention

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
thanked the united states on wednesday for pledging to pay hundreds 
of millions of dollars in back dues but he said the world body 
still faces longterm fiscal problems 
president reagan announced tuesday he is releasing 188 million 
in dues for the current and next fiscal year 
the white house told the state department to work out a 
multiyear plan to repay 520 million more in all overdue 
assessments to the un budget and to the world health organization 
and food and agriculture organization 
assistant secretary of state john whitehead and herbert s okun 
the secondranking diplomat at the us mission to the united 
nations will give the secretarygeneral a check for 15 million 
wednesday afternoon as a first payment said us mission 
spokeswoman anne stoddard 
of course it has been a tremendous relief for me perez de 
cuellar said in an interview 
we consider that it was a very positive development i am 
grateful for the understanding of the president and his staff 
but it is important to understand that we are not completely off 
the hook said the secretarygeneral 
when asked if the long efforts to persuade the united states to 
pay its dues sapped the time of his staff and detracted from the 
uns peacekeeping activities perez de cuellar replied all our 
activities have a price 
the united states had withheld part of its dues to pressure the 
united nations to trim its budget cut the staff by 15 percent and 
adopt personnel reforms the white house now says it is satisfied 
with the uns progress in implementing the reforms 
there are 102 delinquent nations owing the regular un budget 
602 million the outstanding delinquents are the united states at 
467 million south africa 339 million brazil 179 million 
iran 121 million the soviet union 98 million argentina 62 
million mexico 62 million israel 47 million poland 43 
million and romania 4 million 
in addition the united states is about 70 million behind in 
assessed dues to the un peacekeeping forces in lebanon and the 
golan heights 
the united nations has a reserve budget of about 200 million to 
be used as seed money to start up peacekeeping operations and for 
other sudden commitments but the organization had to dip into the 
fund to meet operating expenses 
that fund would have been exhausted by the end of october 
without an infusion of money from the united states leaving the 
united nations unable to meet its payroll rents and other fixed 
operating costs 
a un official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
us pledge to repay its dues may enable the united nations to 
borrow money from nations that had been reluctant to help take up 
the slack caused by the united states 
building up the reserve fund is now a top priority because of 
the possibility that a un peacekeeping force of over 7000 may be 
sent to namibia after nov 1 to monitor that south africanruled 
territorys transition to independence 
the namibia operation may cost 600 million to 700 million he 
said far outstripping the 200 million reserve fund which is 
already near depletion 
other potentially costly un peacekeeping plans in the works 
are a referendum in western sahara on independence or affiliation 
with morocco and a plan for a political settlement in cambodia 
both settlements would require thousands of un peacekeepers 
and election monitors

the us merchandise trade deficit showed the 
biggest improvement in almost six years in july a dramatic 28 
percent narrowing that reflected a big decline in americans 
appetite for foreign goods the government reported wednesday 
the commerce department said the difference between what the 
united states imports and what it sells abroad shrank to 953 
billion in july down 36 billion from a june deficit of 1322 
billion 
the reagan administration lost no time hailing the huge decline 
as proof that the administrations economic strategy of fighting 
soaring trade deficits with a devaluation of the dollar was paying 
off 
in a speech in cape girardeau mo president reagan called the 
trade figures very good news that proved that when america 
goes into the market to compete we play to win 
the 28 percent junetojuly decrease was the biggest monthly 
improvement since a 357 percent narrowing in september 1982 and 
gave the country the lowest overall imbalance since december 1984 
when the deficit was 8 billion 
while the trade deficit has been showing improvement for most of 
this year the gains have all been on the export side reflecting 
the fact that the weaker dollar has made american products 
competitive once again on overseas markets 
imports however had remained at stubbornly high levels 
analysts said this made the july drop particularly encouraging 
the big story is the tremendous improvement in imports 
suggesting that americans might finally be beginning to buy more 
american said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
imports are declining because we have finally found a price 
high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods said 
jay goldinger an economist with capital insight a los angeles 
investment firm 
but other economists cautioned that it was far too early to 
determine whether the import drop was the beginning of a longterm 
trend they noted that the decline to 3599 billion was down from 
a record high level of 3950 billion in june 
i dont think we have reached some kind of watershed where all 
of a sudden consumers have decided they no longer want to buy 
foreign goods said david wyss an economist with data resources 
inc a lexington mass forecasting firm 
the july deficit was substantially better than economists had 
expected the government did however boost the june deficit to 
132 billion from the originally reported 125 billion 
for the first seven months of this year the us trade deficit 
has been running at an annual average of 1375 billion down 193 
percent from the record 1703 billion deficit suffered in 1987 
this improvement has contributed more than half of total 
economic growth this year and economists expected further economic 
momentum from the trade performance in the second half of the year 
good news for republican george bushs presidential chances 
in a second report wednesday the government said that 
industrial output rose a moderate 02 percent in august pushing 
production up a healthy 53 percent over a year ago much of this 
gain reflects the boom in export sales that american companies have 
enjoyed 
in july exports climbed 07 percent to 265 billion the fifth 
straight month they have exceeded 25 billion the july improvement 
came from a variety of areas led by a 600 million rise in sales 
of us manufactured products 
the big drop in imports came primarily in capital goods for 
businesses which fell by 12 billion to 8 billion this category 
had risen sharply the previous month as us companies had looked 
abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production 
facilities 
also dropping sharply in july were car imports which fell by 
803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in 
shipments of cars from canada 
financial markets which over the past year have been thrown 
into a tailspin by unexpectedly bad monthly trade figures gave a 
generally lukewarm response to the good news thursday stock and 
bond prices and the dollar all posted modest gains 
as usual the country suffered its biggest deficit with japan a 
44 billion imbalance which was unchanged from june the deficit 
with western europe rose to 23 billion from 19 billion in june 
the deficits with taiwan and canada were unchanged at 12 billion 
and 11 billion respectively 
with the release of wednesdays report the government resumed a 
practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import 
figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed 
using this system the deficit for july would have been an even 
lower 807 billion down from a june imbalance minus shipping and 
insurance of 117 billion

hispanics hold a record 3360 elected offices 
across the country most of them at the local level the director 
of an organization that tracks hispanic officials said wednesday 
the house of representatives has 11 hispanic members and the 
senate has none but harry pachon national director of the 
national association of latino elected and appointed officials 
said big gains are possible in 1992 when congressional districts 
are reapportioned based on the 1990 census 
although hispanics make up 194 million or 8 percent of the 
countrys population they hold fewer than 1 percent of the 490000 
elected offices nationwide pachon told a capitol hill news 
conference 
pachon however called the gains made by hispanics into elected 
positions dramatic progress its not just rhetoric its an 
increasing reality 
the number of hispanics holding office increased 13 percent 
this year less than the 42 percent increase logged in 1987 but 
that increase reflected the 1986 elections while this years 
figures largely reflect local elections held between august 1987 
and this past august pachon said 
at the same time the number of hispanic women elected to office 
increased by 57 percent this year to 626 or 186 percent of the 
total 
pachon said most of the elected hispanics are democrats except 
in florida where most are republican 
the association said the largest gains were made in the 
southwest with texas accounting for a recordhigh 1611 hispanic 
officials texas has the nations second largest hispanic 
population estimated by the census bureau at 41 million or 231 
percent of the estimated nationwide total 
new mexico had the secondhighest total with 595 hispanic 
officials overall the state has 543000 hispanics or 28 percent 
of the national total 
california has the largest hispanic population in the country 
66 million or 339 percent of the nationwide hispanic population 
and 466 hold elective office 
with 6 million hispanics in california you think there would 
be a half dozen in congress instead of the current four said 
rep albert bustamante a san antonio democrat and chairman of the 
congressional hispanic caucus 
many california hispanics however are not eligible to vote 
bustamante said adding that the situation would change in the 21st 
century when their children can vote 
all of these kids are going to vote and there is going to be a 
tremendous upsurge the 21st century will make a tremendous 
difference bustamante said 
new york with a hispanic population of 21 million or 11 
percent had 68 elected latino leaders the report said fewer than 
states with smaller hispanic populations like arizona with 237 
elected of officials and colorado with 157 
the report said hispanics hold one governorship bob martinez of 
florida and there are 229 hispanic mayors 120 state legislators 
319 county office holders 1106 municipal officials and 1226 
school board members 
other states with doubledigit numbers of elected hispanics were 
florida 50 new jersey 44 illinois 28 connecticut 15 and 
washington 12

terminally ill aids patients should be 
treated in lowcost hospices rather than expensive hospitals 
surgeon general c everett koop said wednesday 
interviewed after an address to the 1500 employees of 
independence blue cross koop said a move toward more hospice care 
would have to come from a publicprivate partnership between 
governments and private insurers 
the public and private sectors have to get together a 
frank discussion of what aids will cost how insurance fits in and 
the terminally ill needing a place to stay he said 
thirty hospitals in the philadelphia area recently reported a 
16 million yearly loss from treating aids patients asked if 
hospitals were being shortchanged koop said there is a need to 
move patients from a hightechnology setting to hospice care to 
save costs during the final stages of the disease 
hospices are homelike facilities that provide support for 
terminally ill patients medical care stresses relief of pain 
rather than efforts to prolong life 
koop said the stigma attached to aids has caused financial 
problems for hospitals partly because some patients fearful others 
might think they have aids have stayed away from institutions 
known for treating people with the disease 
some insurance companies dont insure aids treatment and in 
areas where government has required them to like the district of 
columbia the insurance companies leave town he said 
the public sector has provided enough money for aids care 
he said 
during his speech the surgeon general reiterated his call for 
aids prevention through sexual abstinence monogamy or condom use 
and warned that freeneedle programs will not wipe out the deadly 
disease among intravenous drug abusers he said camaraderie among 
drug abusers leads to the sharing of needles and the potential 
spread of aids 
his twohour speech and questionandanswer session to the 
philadelphiabased insurance company was also beamed to cable 
subscribers nationwide to canada mexico and other parts of south 
america and to philadelphias public school students 
from september 1987 to this month 31000 new cases of patients 
suffering from the symptoms of the disease have been diagnosed in 
the united states koop said there have been 73000 aids cases 
41000 of whom have died reported worldwide since 1981 he said 
depending on the prevalence of aids in the area the chances of 
receiving a unit of blood infected with the virus are one in 40000 
to one in 250000 he said 
about 900 children have been born infected with the virus he 
said 
asked if there was a danger from vials containing aidsinfected 
blood washing up on beaches koop said exposure to salt water 
inhibits the virus ability to grow in a bloodstream or in a 
laboratory 
its sort of icky to go swimming with a bunch of dirty 
bandages floating around but it wont kill you he said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is most frequently spread 
though sexual contact with a partner infected with the virus or 
sharing intravenous drug needles

patients at cook county hospital would have the 
right to refuse treatment by workers who carry the aids virus under 
a proposal praised by some in the medical community as an advance 
in patients rights but criticized by others as misinformed 
the recommendation was approved tuesday by the county boards 
health and hospitals committee it is expected to be endorsed by 
the full board next week becoming the first such policy for a us 
hospital officials said 
it would cover all hospital workers who routinely provide 
direct patient care including doctors and nurses 
cook county hospital director terrence hansen said the proposed 
policy is an effort to increase patients rights but others in the 
medical profession blasted the proposal wednesday 
our reaction is one of dismay said dr lonnie bristow 
speaking for the american medical association there has been no 
case in this country of a patient contracting the aids virus from a 
healthcare worker 
it is important to keep in mind that the disease is not 
transmitted by casual contact bristow a member of the amas 
board of trustees said from his berkeley calif office the 
likelihood of transmission from a healthcare worker is very 
small 
the proposed policy is not offering patients any additional 
protection it implies people should be worried he said 
this is a policy based on fear and it will do no one any 
good said dr renslow sherer who works in the aids prevention 
service at cook county hospital this is an illconceived and 
illadvised policy 
the fact that no other hospital has taken this action means 
the hospitals dont see this as a major problem said ann guild 
director of medical staff affairs for the illinois hospital 
association 
its not supported by scientific evidence that something like 
this is necessary guild said 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys defenses 
against disease leaving a person prey to lifethreatening 
infections and certain cancers 
aids has struck more than 72000 people in this country since 
1979 and killed more than 40000 of them according to the national 
centers for disease control 
the virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is 
believed to be spread through sexual intercourse shared hypodermic 
needles and from infected mothers to their infants before or during 
birth 
the resolution was passed by the committee over the objections 
of cook county hospitals house staff association which represents 
doctors at the institution the chicago womens aids project and 
several other community organizations 
dr stonewall mccuiston president of the house staff 
association said the policy would wrongly give the impression 
that there is a high incidence of aids and hiv cases among county 
hospital workers 
however board member john stroger said it is a case of a 
patients right to know 
doctors at county have told me they wouldnt let members of 
their families be treated by a certain doctor at the hospital 
because they fear he has aids but then they turn around and come 
out for doctors rights stroger said 
neurosurgeon alan bouffard a cook county doctor who died of 
aidsrelated diseases in may was stripped of his medical 
privileges at the hospital in february 1987 by the county board 
which cited concerns about the spread of the disease 
a year later a federal judge ordered him reinstated but 
required him to wear double gloves for certain procedures

one of four british soldiers who shot and 
killed three unarmed irish republican army guerrillas in march 
denied wednesday that his commander sent the antiterrorist unit to 
eliminate the guerrillas 
he testified before a court investigating whether members of the 
special air services were justified in killing the guerrillas who 
the ira has acknowledged were on a mission in this british colony 
 
our only intention was to arrest them said soldier b 
hidden from public view by a curtain for security reasons 
a senior british intelligence officer has testified at the 
inquest that the soldiers believed the three were armed and were 
planning to set off a car bomb during a changing of the guard 
ceremony 
the ira members movements precipitated our action he 
said i believe with the information we were given we did the 
correct thing 
the officer testified on the seventh day of an inquest by 
coroner felix pizzarello and an 11member jury into the march 6 
shooting deaths of sean savage 24 mairead farrell 31 and daniel 
mccann 31 
 
patrick mcgrory the attorney for the families of the ira 
members suggested to soldier b that their tactical commander 
identified only as soldier e sent them out on the 
antiterrorist mission with the impression that the suspects were 
too dangerous to be allowed to live 
during questioning the mcrory challenged soldier b 
you were told to go out and kill the ira members and the 
task was made so plain to you that you feared no legal retribution 
for your actions 
no the soldier responded 
the three guerrillas proved to be unarmed when the soldiers 
opened fire on them near a gas station in gibraltar critics of 
british prime minister margaret thatchers government cited the 
shootings as evidence that her government is implementing an 
unofficial shoottokill policy against ira members believed to 
be on missions to attack british targets 
spanish police found a car linked to the ira and loaded with 141 
pounds of explosives and a timing device in the spanish resort of 
marbella two days after the shooting 
the inquest has no power of prosecution against the seven men 
who formed the unit that took part in the operation against the ira 
members if the jury hands down a verdict of unlawful killing the 
gibraltar attorney general is expected to return criminal 
indictments 
the predominantly catholic ira is fighting to oust the british 
from northern ireland and to unite the province with the mostly 
catholic republic of ireland 
in another incident on wednesday police arrested a british man 
when he tried to enter gibraltar from spain in a van with british 
license plates 
chief inspector glen viagas said the man accompanied by a 
woman a teenager and a child was arrested after customs 
officials searched his white leyland van and found a 22 caliber 
pistol six rounds of ammunition and 16 canisters believed to hold 
tear gas and a gas gun viagas said 
he said the man whom police did not identify carried a british 
passport and is believed to be from scotland he was taken to a 
gibraltar police station for questioning 
viagas said the arrest did not appear to be connected to the 
inquest

us industrial production rose a modest 02 
percent in august the smallest gain in five months following a 
much larger july advance the government said wednesday 
the federal reserve said the increase in august the 11th 
consecutive month without a decline followed a revised 1 percent 
july advance which had been the strongest showing since last 
october 
the august increase was in line with expectations and analysts 
said it should calm fears that the economy was overheating 
with factories operating at their highest levels in eight years 
there had been fears that rising demand pressures would spark an 
inflationary spiral but since late march the federal reserve has 
been pushing interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and 
economists said this strategy is working 
the fears of overheating are dying down said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc a lexington mass consulting 
firm we are not looking for a recession but we are getting 
fairly clear evidence that the economy is slowing down 
wyss predicted that the overall economy which expanded at an 
annual rate of 33 percent in the first half of the year as 
measured by the gross national product should grow at about that 
rate in the current julyseptember quarter but then begin slowing 
in the final three months of 1988 
the august increase in industrial production the smallest since 
an identical 02 percent march advance pushed output at us 
factories mines and utilities up by 53 percent over the level of 
a year ago 
manufacturing continued to grow but just did so more slowly 
coming on the heels of the big july advance said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co the manufacturing sector was in 
good health over the summer 
the report showed that american producers were continuing to 
benefit from record high demand for their goods overseas 
in a separate report wednesday the commerce department said 
that the countrys merchandise trade deficit narrowed dramatically 
in july to a 95 billion gap as a small increase in exports and a 
big drop in imports gave the country its smallest trade imbalance 
since december 1984 
manufacturing companies saw their output advance by 02 percent 
following a 09 percent july increase output at plants making 
durable goods items expected to last three or more years rose by 
02 percent while factories making nondurable goods had a 01 
percent increase 
autos were assembled at an annual rate of 7 million units in 
august down slightly from july but production of light trucks 
showed an increase 
production of business equipment which has been strong all

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
told congress wednesday he sees no need for a blanket ban on 
mergers of the biggest banks and securities firms but will go 
along with such a ban to win passage of legislation permitting 
banks to underwrite securities 
bills passed by the full senate and house banking committee 
would permit bank holding companies to underwrite many securities 
but both bills in provisions aimed at blocking the creation of 
financial giants forbid the merger of the 15 largest securities 
firms with the 15 largest banking companies 
however rep peter rodino dnj chairman of the house 
judiciary committee which is reviewing the bill said he may offer 
an amendment to bring the bill in line with antitrust law which 
focuses on the power of merged firms in specific regional or 
product markets 
rep hamilton fish rny ranking minority member on the 
judiciary subcommittee on monopolies said the largest banks and 
securities firms currently represent little more than 1 percent of 
their current markets 
greenspan told subcommittee members that he and fellow fed 
governors see no threat to the system if those merger 
activities were to take place but he said they did not believe 
it was wise to press the issue for fear of hurting chances for 
repealing the glasssteagall act which separated commercial from 
investment banking in 1933 
he also said he thought such large mergers unlikely large banks 
are more likely to purchase several small securities firms or start 
up a securities division on their own he said 
sen william proxmire dwis sponsor of the senate bill and 
chairman of the senate banking committee is strongly in favor of 
merger limits 
however comptroller of the currency robert l clarke whose 
office regulates nationally chartered banks said arbitrary 
prohibition on certain mergers is not appropriate he urged 
the subcommittee to strike the size limits from the house bill and 
allow regulators to judge each merger individually for its effect 
on competition 
greenspan branded a number of other provisions in the house bill 
as anticompetitive including a ban on corporate stock 
underwriting the prohibition of banks and securities affiliates 
from sharing corporate names logos premises or advertising and a 
restriction on banks ability to sell insurance

interior secretary donald p hodel said 
wednesday he wont force the national park service to change its 
firefighting policy but he repeated his belief that the let it 
burn policy had been a failure and predicted modifications will 
be made before the next fire season 
i think well just have to see what they come up with as a 
recommendation hodel said in an interview referring to the 
policy review just getting under way by the service in cooperation 
with the forest service and other agencies im not planning to 
impose a policy 
comments by environmentalists and others that the let it 
burn policy had succeeded were a backfire by people who fear 
changes he said 
let it burn is how the park service unofficially described 
its practice since 1972 of letting most naturally caused fires burn 
themselves out for the benefits they bring to forest regeneration 
the policy called for fighting fires that threatened human 
settlement and property significant park structures and resources 
and all fires started by humans 
on july 21 pressed by the worst fire season in 300 or 400 years 
in yellowstone national park and the rest of the west the park 
service decided to fight all fires because it could not be sure 
than any one would not get out of control it extended that 
suppression policy to all its parks in august 
the service has argued that the buildup of dead trees and other 
fuel from the 100 years of suppressing all fires before 1972 could 
not be burned off in the 16 years since then and that buildup made 
this years fires far worse than they should have been resulting 
in fire over nearly half of the park in blazes that could not have 
been put out no matter when they were attacked 
some environmental groups have argued that the policy worked and 
should be supported and that no one could have predicted the 
severity of the drought or the fires leaders of these supporting 
groups usually add that people living around yellowstone the most 
vigorous critics of the policy deserve some help for the damage 
done to their businesses by the decline in tourism 
i dont think the majority of the american people would say 
this policy has worked and i would say the american people are 
right hodel said 
asked to define a successful policy the secretary replied 
id rather define what is not successful a policy is not 
successful if the result subjects communities in and near the 
park to extreme jeopardy and evacuations because you didnt know 
if you were going to be able to control the fires as happened 
this year 
he said he believed the park service policy change july 21 had 
happened fairly quickly in the light of available information 
asked whether that change was made quickly enough he responded 
im not going to engage in that kind of thing because the monday 
morning quarterback never gets sacked 
noting that william penn mott director of the park service and 
dale robertson chief of the forest service had admitted that in 
hindsight they would have fought every fire from the beginning 
hodel said he thought park service officials were not satisfied 
with the results of the let it burn policy either 
asked if he were trying to satisfy both critics of the service 
as well as the service and its supporters he replied no im 
trying to be responsive to the best professional and technical 
advice

cold damp weather retarded blazes and chilled firefighters at 
yellowstone national park and firefighters in california worked 
wednesday to put out hot spots and make gold rush county where 
nearly 100 homes burned windproof 
but experts cautioned that the wests worst fire season in 
decades wasnt necessarily over yet 
the fires that have devastated nearly a million acres of the 
nations oldest national park have grown together to form a single 
blaze but cold wet weather has helped firefighters officials 
said 
its been so cold out there the firefighters are coming in to 
get warm and thats really good if they cant stay warm fighting a 
fire said denny bungarz a fire commander at yellowstone where 
temperatures had dipped as low as the upper 20s overnight 
elsewhere firefighters worked to complete lines around a 
stubborn blaze in glacier national park in montana where afternoon 
temperatures climbed into the 70s but winds stayed relatively calm 
army reinforcements began arriving wednesday for a final assault on 
the giant canyon creek fire in westcentral montana 
fires also continued in several other western states including 
washington where firefighters wednesday took advantage of calm 
weather to dig more lines around a blaze in olympic national park 
interior secretary donald hodel confirmed wednesday that the 
forest services widely criticized policy of letting naturally 
caused fires burn was being revised the fires resulting from the 
drought of 1988 which have charred more than 4 million acres show 
that the policy just doesnt make sense he said in a 
television interview 
about 30000 firefighters continued to battle 32 fires in eight 
western states said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
in northern california officials of the state forestry 
department said they were making plans to start sending 
firefighters back to their home stations although the first 
significant pullout probably wouldnt take place until thursday 
the sudden brushfire that destroyed nearly 100 homes sunday and 
monday ebbed almost as rapidly as it had spread and all but a few 
of an estimated 8000 people who had been evacuated at one time or 
another had returned home by wednesday 
the top priority today is to pick up all the remaining hot 
spots that are left we want to be windproof fire operations 
chief ed waggoner said noting that stiffer winds are expected 
again in the sierras beginning friday 
at yellowstone low overnight temperatures forced humidity up to 
almost 100 percent at times bungarz said wednesday morning 
the weather has really knocked this down he said so 
unless the weather changes drastically were definitely in the 
mopup stage 
although forecasts called for warmer drier weather the high 
winds that last week allowed fires to grow by thousands of acres 
each day were not expected 
but bungarz stressed that the fires have surprised firefighters 
in the past he would not call the blazes controlled or contained 
this is tricky he said 
all the fires in the park have burned into one another bungarz 
said in essence creating one fire stretching from the parks 
southern end to its northeastern corner 
in all fires in the greater yellowstone area covered about 15 
million acres including land in wyoming idaho utah and montana 
and have cost more than 100 million to fight 
with clouds that have covered the park since sunday breaking up 
wednesday morning fire officials prepared for warmer weather that 
would let them see how well fire lines that have been built sunday 
would hold up said park spokesman steve iobst 
as long as things dont get crazy here again a lot of 
progress can be made by people on the ground he said 
in the bridgerteton national forest southeast of the park 
officials said firefighters had contained 90 percent of the 
225500acre huckmink fire complex and estimated they would 
control the 38500acre fayette fire by friday 
ed christian grand teton national park assistant chief ranger 
said officials have started releasing firefighters from both fires

a man claiming he wanted to promote peace 
in lebanon held 11 people at gunpoint at a military recruiting 
center wednesday before releasing them unharmed and surrendering 
the gunman identified as samuel eloud 20 of suburban henrico 
county was being held at county police headquarters on 11 counts 
of abduction and 11 counts of use of a firearm in commission of a 
felony authorities said 
police sgt joe sands said eloud described himself to police 
during telephone negotiations as being of lebanese descent and said 
he had two armed companions 
the gunman began releasing his captives after two local radio 
stations broadcast a statement but his goal was not immediately 
clear and he made no specific threats said sands 
slight and wearing a yellow tshirt jeans and sneakers eloud 
walked out of the center about 10 minutes after his last hostage 
placed an ak47 and what looked like ammunition clips on the 
ground then went back inside and emerged with a pistol which he 
also laid on the ground 
he placed his hands on top of his head as directed by police 
officers who handcuffed him and led him away 
the gunman seized the us armed forces recruiting center about 
915 am taking hostage nine military personnel and two civilians 
a marine recruiter reporting for work about 930 am spotted 
the gunman through the front window and went to an adjacent store 
to call police said police lt cm schesventer the gunman also 
telephoned police and remained in contact with a negotiator for the 
next 4 hours 
he released the first hostages a female civilian and a high 
school senior enlisting in the service about 1215 pm and 
gradually sent out the rest before surrendering about 150 pm

said authorities declined to give the hostages names 
the recruiting station is in a strip shopping center on a 
heavily developed commercial street running into suburban henrico

center the statement said there have been no injuries 
negotiations are proceeding the hostagetakers have so far been 
cooperative theyre holding an undetermined number of people the 
hostagetakers goal is peace in lebanon 
lebanon has been racked by sectarian fighting since 1975 
in washington dc the american arab antidiscrimination 
committee issued a statement condemning the action which it called 
a senseless act of terrorism 
we fervently hope that this isolated instance of violence will 
not fan the flames of antiarab sentiment in the united states 
said the statement from committee president abdeen jabara 
terrorism never has been and never will be an acceptable 
solution to the very real anguish and suffering of the lebanese 
people

fbi director william sessions suspended three 
fbi employees and censured three others thursday for negligently 
operating what he told congress was an unnecessarily broad 
terrorism probe into a group opposing the reagan administrations 
central american policies 
all those disciplined were lower and midlevel employees the 
suspensions were for 14 days without pay 
sessions said toplevel officials had been unaware the bureau 
was collecting information on rankandfile members of the 
committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador who he said 
had nothing to do with international terrorism 
sessions said there is no evidence that the white house or any 
other government agency or outside private group attempted to 
influence the cispes probe the investigation took place between 
march 1983 and june 1985 when william webster was fbi director 
sessions became fbi head last november after webster was named cia 
director 
sessions testifying before the senate intelligence committee 
vowed to institute changes that would keep top bureau officials 
fully apprised of sensitive terrorism investigations that might 
impinge on constitutional rights 
the cispes probe began in march 1983 based largely on 
information from a nowdiscredited informant in dallas frank 
varelli alleging the group was supplying financial support to two 
terrorist organizations and preparing for terrorist activities in 
the united states 
varellis background was not checked he was not properly and 
thoroughly reviewed and there was just negligence all the way along 
the line sessions told the committee sessions said that without 
the varelli claims of terrorist activity there would have been an 
insufficient basis to investigate cispes 
committee chairman sen david boren dokla suggested that 
much of varellis information came from unproven allegations 
published in a rightwing magazine in mexico 
sessions disciplined a supervisor and former assistant special 
agent in charge of the dallas fbi office and a supervisor in 
another unspecified bureau along with a field supervisor unit 
chief and section chief at bureau headquarters in washington all 
six were given written reprimands and three of them were placed on 
probation and suspended from duty without pay for 14 calendar days 
he did not give their names 
sources familiar with the action by sessions identified three of 
those being disciplined as george van balen chief of the 
international terrorismglobal unit at fbi headquarters in 
washington ronald davenport a supervisory special agent in the 
washington headquarters and parks stearns a supervisory special 
agent in dallas 
a seventh employee whose performance would in all likelihood 
would have merited dismissal said sessions has resigned that 
was an apparent reference to varellis handler who quit in 1984 
after acknowledging he had given classified documents from fbi 
files to varelli and failed to pass along money that was to have 
been paid to the informer 
the major turning point in the probe came when it was 
unnecessarily broadened in october 1983 to becme nationwide 
scope sessions testified it remained unnecessarily broad 
thereafter 
there was no reason to believe that all cispes members 
nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of el 
salvadoran or us terrorists testified sessions the decision 
to widen the investigation was made at a comparatively low level 
and supervisory personnel at fbi headquarters who should have 
reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its 
significance failed to do so 
the investigation involved all the fbis bureaus encompassed 
180 cispes chapters across the country and spawned 178 spinoff 
investigations including probes of nine groups and the remainder 
probes of individuals he said 
fbi agents photographed protesters at peace rallies recorded 
license plate numbers and investigated nuns union members and 
college students 
the cispes probe involved surveillance undercover attendance at 
meetings interviews with organization members and checks of 
telephone and utility company records and records of license and 
credit bureaus as well as law enforcement agency record checks 
sessions said fbi inspectors who investigated the handling of 
the cispes probe found 31 instances where agents may have violated 
the attorney generals guidelines for carrying out international 
terrorism probes he said 15 of them were subsequently found to be 
violations including 13 deemed serious enough to be reported to 
the presidents intelligence oversight board 
but the cispes investigation does not reflect a policy of 
purposeful interference with legitimate domestic political 
activity he said 
the probe was closed in june 1985 after the justice department 
concluded the group was involved in political activities protected 
by the first amendment and not involved in terrorism 
varellis information was deemed unreliable approximately one 
year into the investigation yet it continued for another year and 
when boren asked why sessions said 
there were other informants there was still the suggestion 
that there would be disruptions by cispes at the republican 
national convention in dallas in 1984 
michael ratner legal director of the center for constitutional 
rights said the center will file a lawsuit if the bureau doesnt 
expunge the names of those investigated the center obtained fbi 
documents early this year disclosing the cispes probe 
ratner told a news conference after the hearing that the 
disciplined fbi personnel should have been fired adding that the 
level and amount of punishment should have been more severe 
what we see here is only smoke said ratner

pope john paul ii arrived in this tiny 
kingdom wednesday just 20 minutes before a bloody shootout between 
police and gunmen holding a busload of nuns and children on a papal 
pilgrimage 
four people reportedly died 
john paul was to fly from botswana to lesotho today but bad 
weather forced his chartered jet to make an unscheduled landing in 
south africa the target of his criticism during his southern 
africa tour 
the pope arrived in lesotho eight hours behind schedule and just 
20 minutes before the tense hostage drama was played out 
police said gunmen hijacked the bus carrying with about 70 
people tuesday drove it to the british high commission or 
embassy compound and demanded to meet the pope authorities said 
the hijackers began firing after they tried to drive the vehicle 
through the closed gates of the embassy compound 
three hijackers and a hostage a young woman were killed in a 
gun battle with police authorities said eleven other passengers 
were wounded the rest of the hostages were rescued and one 
hijacker was arrested police said 
the hijackers held police at bay through tuesday night while 
demanding to meet john paul and lesothos king moshoeshoe ii a 
government official said 
john paul meanwhile had intended to bypass south africa on his 
tour of five neighboring blackruled nations 
but his flight from botswana to lesotho was diverted because of 
bad weather and he spent three hours at johannesburgs jan smuts 
airport before heading overland in a policeescorted convoy to 
rainsoaked lesotho about 270 miles away 
members of lesothos military council greeted the pontiff at the 
border but crowds along the route into maseru were sparse because 
of the wet chilly weather 
john paul did not kiss the ground in johannesburg as he 
customarily does the first time he visits a country and made no 
public statements there he conferred privately with foreign 
minister pik botha 
south africa said it sent special police units into lesotho at 
the governments request to assist if necessary in dealing with 
the hijackers lesotho is surrounded by south africa 
robin cartwright pilot of the popes chartered air zimbabwe 
boeing 707 earlier circled over maseru lesothos capital for 30 
minutes before deciding to divert the flight because of low clouds 
and malfunctioning radio beacons at the airport 
the popes spokesman joaquin navarro said john paul was 
reading a book of philosophy when he was told of the problem 
looked up and said this was not on the schedule 
at jan smuts botha greeted the pope and accompanied him into a 
vip lounge while security forces deployed inside and outside the 
terminal 
we consider it a privilege to assist the holy father said 
botha who ordered 100 meals and several bottles of wine for the 
entourage and had lunch with the pope 
botha said he briefed john paul on the hijacking and discussed 
the political situation in southern africa 
south africans were deeply involved in logistical arrangements 
for the papal visit to lesotho hundreds of thousands of south 
africans had been expected to cross the border to see the pope 
during his scheduled 48hour visit but the bad weather sharply 
reduced the flow of arrivals and huge tent villages set up to 
accommodate pilgrims were virtually empty 
a hard freezing rain fell as king moshoeshoe and other 
officials waited at the airport for hours before the announcement 
that the pope would come by road 
rain normally is considered a sign of good luck in lesotho but 
officials said the downpour was a disaster disrupting the popes 
schedule and wrecking entrepreneurs hopes of profiting from the 
expected large crowds 
lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10day trip also taking 
the pontiff to zimbabwe botswana swaziland and mozambique the 
aborted flight began in botswana 
the vatican has said the pope was advised by south africas 
catholic bishops that this was not an appropriate time for him to 
visit their racially divided nation 
south africas catholic bishops have been active in the 
antiapartheid movement particularly since 17 major black 
opposition groups were banned in february 
the whitecontrolled government has blamed the bishops for the 
popes decision to omit south africa from his official itinerary 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

carter clews was back on the federal trade 
commission payroll wednesday while the agency looked into the 
matter of letters he sent that were critical of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
clews left the commission last week after being given a choice 
of resigning or being fired following criticism that the letters 
may have violated the hatch act which bans political activity by 
federal workers 
but clews later said he was being fired without due process that 
he would seek reinstatement 
commission general counsel robert paul met with clews wednesday 
and said that the press aide was now being treated as an employee 
of the commission 
clews will be on administrative leave with pay until paul 
completes an investigation and reports to commission chairman 
daniel oliver the counsel said 
a final decision probably will be up to oliver and the other 
commissioners 
the dispute developed after letters were sent out questioning 
statements dukakis had made about the commission and offering the 
services of commission members to respond some letters to 
newspapers included a postscript critical of dukakis 
at least one set carried the name of anna davis public affairs 
director for the agency although she contended that wasnt her 
signature clews however said that she signed and approved the 
letter

the agriculture department said wednesday it 
erred in giving out a telephone number for people to call offering 
comments on a proposal to allow a mixture of salvaged meat and bone 
in hotdogs without stating the ingredients on labels 
a terse correction notice by the departments information 
office said that all comments should be submitted in writing by 
nov 8 
dave warren usda press chief said agency officials were not 
prepared to take oral comments so theyll have to be in writing 
the proposal was announced by usda on monday it would allow 
processors to include a mixture of salvaged meat including small 
bits of bone to be used in up to 10 percent of the meat content of 
hotdogs and similar items without showing the ingredients on 
product labels 
the salvaged product designated as mss or mechanically 
separated species such as pork or beef is made by grinding up 
ribs neckbones and other hardtocarve parts of slaughtered 
animals and forcing the mixture through sieves 
most of the bone particles are screened out but some about 
the size of ground pepper flakes remain in the mixture 
current regulations permit the mss to comprise up to 20 
percent of the meat portion of hotdogs bologna and other sausages 
but the labels must state the contents 
processors who asked for the exemption from the labeling rule 
said they cant sell consumers on the idea of having such a mixture 
in hotdogs under the present labeling requirement 
the written comments can be sent by nov 8 to policy office

failure to loosen fuel economy standards for 
1989 and 1990 cars will cost american jobs and may drive carbuyers 
into the showrooms of foreign manufacturers the nations two 
largest automakers said wednesday 
general motors corp and ford motor co at a public hearing 
urged the national highway traffic safety administration to keep 
the mandatory fuel economy level from reverting to 275 miles per 
gallon in october 
both gm and ford said they could not produce a mix of cars that 
would have a corporate average fuel economy or cafe at that 
level chrysler corp the third large us automaker projected it 
will meet or exceed a 275 mpg standard next year and did not speak 
at the hearing 
the standard has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 under an 
exception allowed by nhtsa 
the fueleconomy law adopted in 1975 to reduce imported 
petroleum consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices sets a 
maximum level of fuel consumption each automakers fleet of 
passenger cars on average must meet 
fords inability to meet the 275 mpg cafe standard for 1989 
and 1990 is not because of lack of effort but instead is because 
of substantial market and economic changes said donald buist 
fords director of automotive emissions and fuel economy 
with gasoline prices averaging below 1 a gallon larger cars 
are selling well as consumers look for luxury and performance 
rather than concentrating on mileage buist said 
the corporate average fuel economy is calculated on the basis of 
sales and public demand for less fuel efficient large cars drives 
the average up the automakers said 
overly stringent cafe standards restrict domestic production 
of larger cars and higher performance engines buist said 
foreign manufacturers in particular the japanese are ready and 
willing to meet this consumer demand with vehicles built or sourced 
predominately in foreign countries this could result in the loss 
of thousands of us jobs without any appreciable fuel economy 
savings 
gm presented transportation secretary james burnley with 5000 
letters from employees of and retirees from its arlington texas 
assembly plant their families and labor leaders urging him to 
lower the cafe standard to 265 mpg 
a 275 mpg standard would force cutbacks in bigcar production 
resulting in layoffs in arlington and elsewhere that would cost gm 
and its suppliers 60000 jobs in 1989 and 110000 jobs in 1990 
said richard klimisch gms environmental activities executive 
director 
klimisch said gm has lost in its share of the market because 
weve gone too far with cafe 
it doesnt do any good to put in new technology if you cant 
sell the cars klimisch said 
opponents of looser standards urged nhtsa to raise the 
fueleconomy requirement to 275 mpg as the agency has proposed 
clarence ditlow director of the center for auto safety a 
consumers group said if the standards were relaxed the domestic 
manufacturers would virtually become importers of everything but 
large cars given the projected worldwide glut of auto production 
capacity the result he said would be the export of us jobs 
the center proposed raising the standard to 55 mpg by the turn 
of the century beginning at 30 mpg in 1991 
nhtsa said it expects to issue a rule on the 1989 and 1990 
standards within weeks 
gm said its 1988 average fleet mileage would be 275 mpg or 276 
mpg ford projected average fuel economy of 265 mpg this year and 
chrysler said its cars would average 285 mpg

opposition leaders on wednesday demanded an 
explanation of a mysterious shooting incident that led to the swift 
expulsion of the cuban ambassador and a junior envoy who allegedly 
fired on a british security team 
the foreign office remains mute in the face of allegations and 
counterallegations about a cloakanddagger intrigue which makes 
james bond read like a railway timetable said the labor partys 
foreign affairs spokesman george foulkes 
the abrupt expulsion of the two diplomats and the governments 
refusal to comment on a host of allegations triggered charges that 
officials were trying to cover up an intelligence operation 
foulkes urged prime minister margaret thatcher to explain the 
secret spiders web of espionage and the extent of involvement by 
mi5 britains counterespionage agency 
the foreign office stuck to its position that third secretary 
carlos manuel medina perez behaved improperly by opening fire 
monday afternoon in a london street and said the circumstances 
behind the shooting were irrelevant both medina and cuban 
ambassador oscar fernandezmell were expelled and left tuesday 
british government sources acknowledged tuesday that medina was 
being trailed by security agents 
officially authorities said medina fired at a group of three 
men and a woman slightly wounding one man police have interviewed 
the wounded man but refused to identify him and say the case is 
closed 
cubas communist government said one of the men allegedly 
trailing medina perez was florentino azpillaga lombard a former 
cuban diplomat who they say defected to the united states and is 
working with the cia 
cuba said he was trying to force medina to defect 
reaction in cuba was uniformly harsh 
scotland yard amazed the world by saying that the case is 
closed before being opened said an editorial in the cuban 
communist party newspaper granma which was broadcast by radio and 
monitored in miami 
it is not a surprise because what happened in london was one 
of the more calamitous joint operations of the cia and the british 
secret service it added 
the editorial charged the british government secret service and 
the cia have been caught with their hands in the cookie jar 
the affair highlighted what former british foreign secretary 
david owen said was routine surveillance of communist diplomats 
suspected of spying 
the more i hear about this cuban socalled diplomat the more 
likely i think it is that he was under surveillance and quite 
rightly so said owen foreign secretary in a labor government 
before mrs thatchers conservative party won power in 1979 
owen added that an attempt to get medina to defect would be 
not uncommon 
theres nothing wrong with that the fundamental issue is 
that were not having people opening fire in the streets of london

utilities that contracted with the 
washington public power supply system purposely misled bond buyers 
about the need for two nuclear power plants and never intended to 
make good on their 225 billion bond debts a lawyer argued 
wednesday 
official statements made to entice investors to buy wppss bonds 
contained a number of false promises attorney tom barr said in 
the plaintiffs opening statement he represents chemical bank of 
new york which has sued on behalf of 24000 bond buyers 
we claim and we will prove that these false statements were 
made fraudulently and negligently barr said 
the defendants deny the claims of fraud saying poor judgment 
may have been used but that wppss and defendant utilities hired 
expert advisers and acted in what they believed were the best 
interests of power consumers in the northwest 
twenty people were selected last week to serve as jurors in the 
huge complex case the trial moved here from washington state 
because of pretrial publicity was expected to take months 
wppss was formed in 1957 by public utilities to build and 
operate major electric plants in washington idaho and oregon 
in the 1970s it embarked on an ambitious plan to build five 
nuclear power plants but was plagued by cost overruns and 
construction delays only one plant was completed and is operating 
in 1983 wppss defaulted on 225 billion in bonds sold for the 
fourth and fifth of those plants leaving thousands of bond buyers 
holding worthless paper and spurring a host of lawsuits the 
default was the biggest in the history of the municipal bond 
market the two nuclear plants were never completed 
barr said the 16 defendant utilities which are wppss directors 
claimed there was a need for more electricity in the northwest when 
there was not they also repeatedly changed cost estimates for the 
plants he said 
the first of 14 bond sales estimated that the two plants would 
cost 337 billion he said that was in june 1977 in may 1981 
barr said the estimate had jumped to 118 billion and the dates 
for plant completion had jumped several years 
the ultimate ace up their sleeve barr said of the 
utilities was the washington state court system 
they intended first to go to court to try to get their state 
courts to get them out of their promises he said adding that it 
worked 
the default occurred after the washington state supreme court 
ruled the 88 utilities participating in construction of the two 
plants had signed illegal contracts 
besides the 16 utilities with special ties to the supply system 
remaining defendants include two engineering firms and an adviser 
to wppss seven other utilities settled out of court with the 
plaintiffs

defense secretary frank c carlucci bluntly 
warned the philippines foreign secretary on wednesday the united 
states is prepared if pushed to move its military bases from 
that island nation according to pentagon officials 
the officials who insisted on anonymity said carlucci went out 
of his way during a closeddoor meeting with foreign secretary raul 
manglapus to stress americas support for the philippine government 
and president corazon aquino 
but the defense secretary troubled by an impasse over the 
future of the subic bay naval base and clark air base told 
manglapus the united states was not bluffing over the issue of 
monetary compensation and that there are other alternatives which 
have been found to be militarily and economically feasible said 
one source 
the secretary told him we understand the philippines 
financial problems the official continued but that there are 
limits for us too 
we are pretty well stretched to the edge of our limits here 
there is very little flexibility left and carlucci told him that 
while it would be extremely unfortunate for both countries we are 
prepared to look elsewhere 
the sources characterized the discussions at the pentagon as 
designed to reinforce a message delivered earlier this week by 
secretary of state george p shultz by stressing for the first time 
the pentagon really is prepared to move those bases if it has 
to 
we dont want to but we will and more importantly can 
added one official 
the sources said the leading candidate selected by military 
planners and carlucci as an alternative for the bases is guam an 
island that is farther away from asia but which offers the 
advantage of being a us territory 
manglapus came to the pentagon on wednesday for oneonone talks 
with carlucci after consulting with shultz on tuesday following 
his visit to the state department he told reporters there has 
been nothing to justify my saying that we are closer together 
the major issue in the talks is us compensation to the 
philippines for use of the bases manglapus has declined to provide 
details of the aid figures being discussed but congressional 
sources and reports in the philippines indicate he is asking for 
about 12 billion annually over the next two years 
this would represent a sizeable increase over the 180 million a 
year to which the reagan administration has been committed since 
1983 in addition to cash aid the philippines also is said to be 
seeking trade concessions debt relief and other soft 
components as manglapus described them 
the administration reportedly has offered 360 million yearly in 
1989 and 1990 in addition to food assistance and other concessions 
for a total of just under 500 million 
shultz said last week the filipino demands were out of 
bounds adding that we will be patient and we will be 
persistent in efforts to overcome the impasse 
manglapus has argued a substantial aid increase is warranted 
partly to correct what he suggests is an historical injustice 
contending the united states used military facilities in the 
philippines for more than 70 years without compensating filipino 
authorities 
in other countries he said the united states has provided aid 
immediately after establishing military bases

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
118 on wednesday to insist that former marine lt col oliver l 
north comply with a subpoena it issued five months ago demanding 
that he produce hundreds of pages of classified diary pages 
the documents are sought by a foreign relations subcommittee 
investigating international narcotics trafficking 
north and his attorney brendan l sullivan have resisted 
producing the diaries which north maintained as an official on the 
staff of the national security council he was fired from that job 
amid disclosures he had been involved in the secret sale of us 
arms to iran and in the diversion of part of the proceeds to 
nicaraguas contra rebels 
sen john kerry dmass the subcommittee chairman sought the 
subpoena after noticing heavily censored references to narcotics in 
copies of the diaries obtained by the congressional irancontra 
committees 
he said they were relevant to his panels investigation because 
of references to narcotics to apparent links to the contras and to 
the investigation itself 
the full committee issued the subpoena last april 26 on a 171 
vote 
on wednesday kerry said the committee had met some of 
sullivans objections narrowing the scope of the subpoena to 
sections of the diaries containing references relevant to the 
subcommittees probe and not insisting on receiving all 2048 pages 
sen jesse helms rnc continued to object to the decision to 
pursue the subpoena saying it was unfair when north is facing 
trial in us district court here on charges growing out of the 
irancontra affair 
some senators expressed doubt that the committee can obtain the 
subpoenaed documents by the time the 100th congress adjourns next 
month 
kerry urging his colleagues not to accept further delay 
referred to sullivan and said delay plays into the hands of a 
very clever counselor and plays into the hands of those who want to 
see all of this disappear

the united states will have a soupkitchen 
workforce unable to take part in the technological job market of 
the future unless it upgrades the critical skills of at least 12 
million atrisk youth according to reports released wednesday 
if we dont upgrade their skills we will continue to 
increase the polarization between those at low income levels and 
those at the high income levels said larry brown chairman of 
the national youth employment coalition 
he warned that such a situation would add pressure put on the 
social fabric of this nation which has not been seen since the 
early 60s 
brown who is also president of washington dcbased 7001 
training amp employment institute was one of five representatives 
presenting his organizations report at the coalitions press 
conference called to focus attention on americas forgotten 
future a closeup look at solving the problems of atrisk children 
and youth 
atrisk youth are those between 14 and 24 years of age who 
may be members of low income or welfare families teenage parents 
dropouts lack basic educational skills or have criminal records 
which place them at risk for education and employment failure the 
coalition said 
although each report pinpointed a particular aspect of programs 
designed to help youth overcome these social and economic problems 
all agreed that the problem of illprepared youth was one that 
would come back to haunt the nation 
shioghan nicolau president of the hispanic policy development 
project in new york called for a fundamental restructuring of 
middle and secondary schools to emphasize job skills and 
responsibility early on 
in too late to patch his group provided a basic primer to 
successful programs for fastgrowing hispanic atrisk 
populations in new york florida illinois texas and california 
budget priorities have virtually forced program operators to 
emphasize the cheaper options nicolau said noting the lack of 
proper supportive services like day care and oneonone counseling 
psychologist kenneth b clark echoed the consensus of the 
experts in a report entitled americas shame americas hope 12 
million youth at risk cited at wednesday meeting 
we could not give the states of this nation a passing grade 
for what has been done for youth atrisk up to now we would have 
to hand out an f still failing but at least beginnng to pay 
attention in class clarks report said 
as to the federal governments stewardship fo the problem we 
can think of no approporiate grade absent is the school term 
that comes most readily to mind the report added 
we have the ways to teach poor kids we do have the technology 
and if we dont find the will as dr clark suggests we going to 
have a soupkitchen labor force in a postindustrial economy 
said george b autry president of mdc inc a nonprofit chappel 
hill ncbased research group which commissioned the clark study 
the other reports released included 
a practitioners guide strategies programs and resources 
for youth employability development from publicprivate ventures

bureaucratic infighting means the 
administrative system being set up by the customs service to 
oversee the federal governments antidrug effort wont be the 
centralized operation sought by congress a congressional watchdog 
agency said wednesday 
the report by the general accounting office led two key senators 
to question whether the customs service should spend any more money 
on the system customs has already spent 42 million and is seeking 
another 8 million 
six federal agencies have a role in the federal governments 
increasing efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the 
united states 
two years ago as part of an antidrug bill congress ordered 
the customs service to develop a centralized commandandcontrol 
system to improve coordination among federal agencies 
for example the customs service and the coast guard now operate 
separate facilities along the southern us border for overseeing 
planes and ships used to track drug traffickers 
but the drug enforcement agency and the coast guard have both 
dropped out of the wideranging system originally envisioned by the 
1986 law the gao noted meaning the intent of the legislation may 
not be fulfilled 
the gao report also noted that there are increasing 
congressional demands to make the defense department the chief 
coordination agency in the antidrug effort which would mean the 
customs program would be outdated 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate investigations 
subcommittee said the gao study raises serious questions 
regarding the adequacy of the customs program and whether congress 
should continue to fund it 
the gao report highlights a series of concerns raised by a 
number of senators that the customs project has been fatally flawed 
from its inception said nunn 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the senate budget 
committee said we were led to believe that this command and 
control system would coordinate not complicate our drug programs 
were throwing fuel on a fire that is out of control if we barge 
ahead with this system 
customs officials did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking comment but the gao report quoted customs officials as 
agreeing with the studys conclusions

the bureau of indian affairs signed a contract 
wednesday to turn over management of 18 billion in trust funds to 
private management for the first time 
the new manager security pacific national bank of los angeles 
will take over accounting receipt and disbursement of funds for 
300000 separate accounts from the bureau and the treasury 
the contract runs for a year but may be renewed annually four 
times if the bank remains manager for five years it will be paid 
212 million the government would pay about 1 million to convert 
its accounting system to the banks specifications which will take 
about a year 
to keep on managing the accounts inhouse would cost the 
government 25 million over the same period said bureau spokesman 
carl shaw 
where well really gain is in the electronic transfer of 
funds shaw said 
checks being mailed from office to office now can take several 
days during which money is not earning interest the bankoperated 
system should enable receipts to start earning interest much 
sooner shaw said 
the bureau may invest trust funds only in government securities 
or federally insured accounts in banks and savings and loan 
associations the bank will not make actual investment decisions 
only recommendations to the bureau which retains legal 
responsibility for the investments 
the bureau had planned to award the contract to mellon national 
bank of pittsburgh but following complaints from tribes that they 
had not been adequately consulted and from the treasury and other 
banks that specifications had been too narrowly drawn the bureau 
reopened competition for the contract in march 1987

a man who was fed rat poison by his wife 
begged a judge not to sentence her to prison but his plea was 
ignored by the judge who gave the woman a fiveyear sentence 
weve been married 28 years if i ever needed her i need her 
now i cant even make it to the bathroom now an ailing james 
crittenden 46 said tuesday at the circuit court hearing 
nevertheless judge charles woods sentenced flora crittenden 
47 to five years in prison and ordered her to pay restitution 
court costs and 25 to the state victims compensation fund 
the judge suspended mrs crittendens sentence pending a 
probation hearing she was released on the same 20000 bond she 
had been free on since shortly after her arrest in may no date for 
the hearing was set 
mrs crittenden originally was charged with attempted murder in 
the poisoning of her husband but pleaded guilty to the lesser 
charge of seconddegree assault in an agreement with prosecutors 
it seemed like a reasonable settlement dale county district 
attorney david emery said she did assault him with rat 
poisoning her husband forgave her before he even got out of the 
hospital 
dale county sheriff bryant mixon has said crittenden who was 
hospitalized following the poisoning refused to sign an arrest 
warrant mixon said his department signed the warrant 
mixon said mrs crittenden apparently poisoned her husband by 
putting arsenic in his food and drinking water 
crittenden had been sick for awhile before his wifes arrest he 
now needs a walker to get around 
mrs crittendens attorney johnny hardwick said crittenden had 
suffered a workrelated accident before the charges were brought 
against his wife he said it was unclear whether the accident or 
poison was responsible for crittendens sickness 
mixon said his department was notified of the poisoning after 
crittendens doctor detected a high level of arsenic in him mixon 
said a possible motive was a life insurance policy on crittenden 
for an unspecified substantial amount of money

the senate wont pass a bill for a 
legislative taking of land adjacent to the manassas national 
battlefield park in suburban virginia to prevent the construction 
of a shopping center the chairman of the committee involved said 
wednesday 
the house passed the bill 30798 on aug 10 taking the 542acre 
williams center tract and providing up to 30 million in 
compensation such a seizure of land is rare and leaves to a later 
court determination how much the owner should get 
prince william county authorities already have approved the 
shopping center which is to be accompanied by office and 
residential development on the tract 
the controversy has galvanized many environmentalists and civil 
war buffs who see desecration in the location of a shopping center 
next to the park commemorating the first and second battles of 
manassas in the civil war 
sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the energy and natural 
resources committee said he intended to vote for the measure and 
expected to send it to the floor 
but the bill violates a senate rule against bringing 
entitlement legislation to the floor outside of the budget 
process and the budget committee is unlikely to waive the rule he 
said 
sixty senators could vote to set the rule aside but johnston 
said i frankly dont think itll pass a 60vote point of order 
at this time in this session 
still he told his colleagues during a discussion of the bill at 
a committee meeting we are at least saying this is a high 
priority and this kind of land should not be lost 
the ranking republican james mcclure of idaho said the last 
legislative taking a seizure of redwood forest lands in 
california in 1980 had been projected to cost 349 million but 
would cost 14 billion 
he said land in the manassas area was now selling for 17 to 
1750 per square foot so the entire tract could cost 413 million 
at the higher figure 
mcclure noted that the committee had left the tract in private 
hands when it enlarged the park in 1980 deciding that it was not 
significant enough historically to include in the park 
we made a mistake in 1980 said sen dale bumpers dark 
chairman of the national park subcommittee in arguing for support 
of the house bill 
we have a necessity to understand how we got where we are 
bumpers said in arguing for the significance of the tract 
james mcpherson author of the recent highly praised onevolume 
history of the civil war battle cry of freedom testified at a 
subcommittee hearing that the second battle of manassas was the 
most significant of the war for the south bumpers said

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
announced wednesday that the state finished last fiscal year with a 
67 million surplus 
the massachusetts governor said 25 million had been expected 
and was already credited to the books for the 116 billion fiscal 
1989 budget 26 had to be earmarked under law for a rainy day 
account and the rest may be used to fund some programs that were 
conditionally vetoed because of budget problems 
one critic said dukakis achieved the surplus by cutting back on 
human services spending late in fiscal 1988 which ended june 30 
another the republican house minority leader said any surplus 
would be the product of tax and fee increases government borrowing 
and a raid on the pension fund 
dukakis has campaigned on his record as a fiscal manager

portauprince haiti ap a bishop and an opposition leader 
expressed doubt wednesday that haitis military rulers will live up 
to their promise to punish thugs who massacred nine parishioners 
and burned down two churches 
we call on god to help us surmount this bloody ferocious 
dictatorship bishop willie romelus of the western town of 
jeremie said on the roman catholic churchs radio soleil 
serge gilles coleader of the leftist patriotic unity bloc 
said sundays massacre happened under the very nose of the army 
and police and they did not intervene to prevent the bloodshed 
the government said tuesday night it regretted the massacre 
at st jean bosco church when two dozen hoodlums killed nine 
people at mass and wounded 77 then burned down the building as 
soldiers watched from an army compound across the street 
radio haiti inter said thugs burst into the staterun general 
hospital tuesday searching for a survivor of the church massacre a 
32yearold woman saying they wanted to finish her off 
the unidentified woman and her daughter then still in the womb 
were wounded sunday when an assailant stabbed them with a skewer 
doctors saved both the gang left without finding the woman the 
station reported wednesday 
authorities also promised to find and punish those responsible 
for burning down another church late monday night 
it is difficult to have confidence in the promises of the 
military government gilles said 
lt gen henri namphys government has issued statements of 
regret in the past following mass murders and political 
assassinations but no convictions resulted 
five men and a woman appeared on state television boasting they 
took part in the massacre which they said was directed at the rev 
jean bertrand aristide an outspoken critic of the army they 
threatened a heap of corpses if aristide holds future masses 
the six made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the 
government network without apparent fear of arrest or reprisals 
romelus aristides uncle and the most radical of haitis 10 
bishops said if the leaders of the government are not 
responsible shouldnt they have arrested them the six 
immediately 
he said the military government deplored and condemned and 
promised to arrest only after other countries made their 
declarations 
the interamerican commission on human rights of the 
organization of american states accused the government of allowing 
the massacre 
the police stood by during the attacks said a statement 
issued by oas offices in washington and portauprince since 
there is a military post very near the church the commission can 
only conclude that this attack was perpetrated at least with the 
acquiescence of the government 
the commission had sent a factfinding mission to haiti last 
month 
namphy returned to power after ousting the 4monthold civilian 
government of president leslie manigat on june 19 namphy 
previously headed a junta which ruled this impoverished caribbean 
nation for two years following dictator jeanclaude duvaliers 
flight into french exile

ptl founder jim bakker and a former ptl 
board member disagreed wednesday in bankruptcy court over who set 
the evangelists high salary with bakker saying the board approved 
it and the director saying the board never acted on the matter 
the dismissed tv preacher was called to the stand by attorneys 
for ptl which is trying to win a 52 million claim against bakker 
his wife tammy and former top aide david taggart 
ptl attorneys want the bakkers and taggart to repay money they 
say was lost through mismanagement of ptl accounts and unjustified 
compensation and benefits the trial began monday before us 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
the ministry has been trying to reorganize in bankruptcy court 
since june 1987 three months after bakker left the ministry amid a 
sex and money scandal involving former church secretary jessica 
hahn the ministrys debts total more than 130 million 
asked by ptl attorney brad leggett who decided his 1984 salary 
of 228000 bakker replied that it was set by the board of 
directors 
i have been with heritage village ministries with 15 years and 
the board began my salary then and any raises would have been voted 
up from that point he said 
however earlier wednesday charles h cookman district 
superintendent for the assemblies of god ministries north carolina 
area and a member of the ptl board from 1980 to 1987 testified 
that the board of directors never ruled on salaries i dont know 
who set the salaries 
bakker has been trying to regain control of the evangelical 
empire which includes the ptl television network and the heritage 
usa christian resort 
on wednesday bakker attorney jim toms said outside court that 
bakker still is interested in buying back ptl despite the 
rejection of his offer last week when he failed to prove he had the 
money to back his 172 million bid 
toms added however were not going to talk about any 
financing until we get some money until we hear a faint rustle 
reynolds has ordered bankruptcy trustee mc red benton jr 
to find a buyer for the ministry on monday he filed a report with 
reynolds saying that he cannot recommend a buyer now he asked 
reynolds to allow him until sept 27 to file a motion for sale 
either to a private buyer or at auction 
in his testimony cookman said board meetings were run primarily 
by bakker with help from the former executive vice president 
richard dortch 
cookman said it was not until march 1987 when bakker resigned 
that he became aware of the ministrys troubles i was 
astonished he said to learn the extent of bonuses given to 
bakker and other executives 
when he first joined the board cookman said he understood 
bakkers salary to be between 35000 and 40000 a year in 
1986 i asked richard dortch what bakkers salary was and my 
recollection of his reply was 200000 
he testified that in one meeting the issue of compensation for 
taggart was raised but board members were told that comes under 
the administration of ptl and is not a board matter 
also wednesday an irs auditor testified that because of a lack 
of documentation at ptl he could only assume that some expenses 
charged to the ministry by the bakkers and their top aides were for 
personal use 
larry howlett a nashville tennbased auditor of taxexempt 
organizations testified tuesday he could find no paperwork to 
prove a legitimate business purpose for expenditures including a 
personal 300foot water slide at the bakkers tega cay home on lake 
wylie two rolls royce automobiles and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars bakker and others got through ptl accounts 
under crossexamination wednesday by bakker attorney ryan hovis 
howlett conceded however that because of the lack of 
documentation he could only assume the bakkers and taggart were 
using the cars and other expenditures for no legitimate business 
purpose 
reynolds also must act on a motion filed by fairfax savings and 
loan corp of baltimore a major ptl creditor to shut down the 
ministry and auction off its assets 
the bank accused benton of misleading creditors and the court 
about the seriousness of ptls situation 
in the motion filed last week fairfax which holds ptl 
mortgages totaling 12 million criticized benton for failing to 
find a buyer for ptls assets

flood waters receded wednesday but the 
death toll kept climbing and health officials called for 
international shipments of watertreatment chemicals and medicines 
to stop a killer epidemic of diarrhea 
health secretary manzurul karim on wednesday said there have 
been 319860 official cases of diarrhea and 168 diarrhearelated 
deaths since aug 27 on tuesday officials reported 283703 
official cases and 150 deaths 
karim said pharmaceutical companies were working overtime to 
manufacuture medicines to battle the outbreak of diarrhea caused by 
floodwaters filled with sewage 
bangladesh does not need foreign doctors but will welcome 
limited quantity of medicines from the friendly countries he 
said at a news conference 
bangladesh needs 75 million water purification tablets out of 
which it will produce 25 million units locally we have instructed 
local companies to produce various lifesaving drugs in double 
shifts he said 
mohamed elnaggar a world health organization representative in 
dhaka said most cases of diarrhea are not being reported to the 
hospitals 
what is believed to be the worst flooding in bangladesh history 
has caused 1804 deaths from drowning snake bites collapsed 
buildings and diarrhea according to daily reports in dhaka 
newspapers officials reports routinely lower put the death toll 
at 899 as of wednesday 
the monsoon flooding has affected more than 30 million people in 
threefourths of this country which is roughly the size of 
wisconsin 
the real number is impossible to ascertain given bangladeshs 
unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before 
the floods

leonid i brezhnevs grandson said in an article 
published wednesday that growing criticism of the former soviet 
leader has turned into a smear campaign that is hurting him and 
other family members 
but a second article by a wellknown journalist indicated the 
attacks on brezhnev centered on the bribery trial of his 
soninlaw yuri churbanov is not about to stop 
the journalist fyodor burlatsky also shed some light on how 
brezhnev assumed power from nikita s khrushchev in 1964 
the two articles sharpened the debate over the 19641982 period 
when brezhnev was in power an investigation of the brezhnev era 
has overtaken the reevaluation of josef stalins repression as the 
major historical topic under review in the soviet press 
criticism of previous leaders under way on a large scale in the 
more open atmosphere of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms is 
nevertheless traditional in the soviet system and often gives 
citizens an indirect clue about where the leadership wants to take 
the country 
im 27 years old and my independent life is only beginning 
but i already feel that my surname ever more frequently has become 
a stumbling block in the most varied situations andrei brezhnev 
wrote in the weekly moscow news 
i want to be just like everyone i am just like everyone but 
many dont want to see anything in me except my surname he said 
he said much of the current criticism of brezhnev for bringing 
in a period of stagnation and corruption is justified but that 
his grandfather also was a victim of the political system and is 
being unfairly blamed for mistakes of his aides 
the younger brezhnev said tales of the familys corrupt and 
opulent lifestyle while his grandfather was in office were partly a 
result of the lack of information soviets have about their leaders 
private life and partly a result of the actions of his aunt 
brezhnevs daughter galina who he described as uncontrollable 
churbanov charged in a trial that opened sept 5 with fostering 
a huge network of bribery and corruption in the republic of 
uzbekistan is married to galina 
the younger brezhnev said he went to a normal school and did not 
associate with the children of high party officials 
the sharp criticism of brezhnev continued wednesday on the pages 
of the authoritative weekly literary gazette 
burlatsky who was ousted from his job in the international 
department of the communist party central committee during 
brezhnevs years said brezhnev was a weak man who knew only how to 
work the giant party and government apparatus 
soviet society must find out how it could happen that in such 
a difficult period in the history of our motherland and in the 
worlds history that the weakest of all leaders who reached this 
position in soviet and perhaps in prerevolutionary times was at 
the wheel of management 
he said brezhnev cultivated with almost childlike simplicity 
the accessories of his cult 
he said brezhnev was a master of compromise who knew how to 
place his supporters in the middle and high levels of the party and 
government apparatus 
those surrounding brezhnev thirsted only for one thing that 
this person would live forever thats how good things were for 
them burlatsky said 
he said that brezhnev was considered a weak and transitional 
figure by other party leaders who wanted to get rid of khrushchev 
because of his erratic policies 
khrushchevs ouster was orchestrated not by brezhnev or 
conservative party ideology chief mikhail suslov but by former kgb 
chief alexander shelepin he said 
shelepin led a group that plotted against khrushchev in meetings 
in football stadiums and other unlikely places he said 
in a key move shelepin successfully changed khrushchevs 
personal guard when he was called back from vacation for the 
central committee meeting at which he was replaced that tipped 
khrushchev off and he tried to stop the flight taking him to 
moscow but he could not burlatsky said 
burlatsky said a speech by alexei adzhubei khrushchevs 
soninlaw and editor of the government newspaper izvestia served 
as impetus to call the meeting 
he said adzhubei suggested that moscow saw no great problems 
preventing reunification of east and west germany the leaders of 
communist east germany quickly expressed their indignation to 
their soviet colleagues and this served as the spark that lit the 
flame 
burlatsky said brezhnev was in debt to khrushchev for advancing 
his party career with brezhnev moving up steadily in the ukrainian 
party apparatus while khrushchev was at its head 
the journalist noted the two leaders opposite approaches to 
policy he said khrushchev was bold and took risks while brezhnev 
tried to minimize risk and was very cautious

sen dan quayle said wednesday that soviet 
testlaunching of an ss25 mobile intercontinental ballistic 
missile showed the united states needs to develop mobile strategic 
missiles something he said would never happen if democrat michael 
dukakis is elected president 
quayle the republican vice presidential nominee who is a member 
of the senate armed services committee said he was told of the 
test by officials of norad the joint uscanada warning system 
the senator toured a norad facility earlier in the day 
quayle said he was told that the soviets launched the ss25 at 
850 am edt from plesetsk aimed at kamchatka just across the 
bering sea from alaska the soviets informed the united states of 
the launch he said 
the soviets have two types of mobile icbm missiles the ss25 
and the ss24 
the united states does not presently have mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missiles although two such missiles 
the midgetman and the rail mobile mx have been under development 
us intercontinental ballistic missiles presently are in concrete 
silos buried in the ground 
dukakis is opposing modernization of our landbased missile 
force while the soviets are already ahead of us quayle said 
the governor has already stated that he opposes flight testing 
of our missiles so even if he wanted to develop a deterrent his 
flight test ban would prevent us from ensuring that the system 
would work quayle said 
do we want someone with the governors views sitting across 
the negotiating table from mr mikhail gorbachev he added 
dukakis in a speech in washington on wednesday called the mx 
which he opposes a sitting duck he said the strategic 
concept of the midgetman is sound but i question the value of 
spending 40 billion or 50 billion for 500 additional landbased 
missile warheads at three times the cost of the same number of 
new submarinebased warheads 
it was a day in which quayle continued his attack on dukakis 
portraying him as weak on defense and foreign policy issues 
the united state could never have achieved the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty if the nuclear freeze 
advocated by michael dukakis had been adopted quayle said 
the only thing he would have frozen in place was a dangerous 
destabilizing soviet mediumrange nuclear monopoly in europe 
quayle said 
quayle spoke to the denver kiwanisrotary clubs where several 
hundred protesters staged a noisy demonstration as he arrived they 
carried signs reading bush cocaine contra and a vote for 
quayle is a vote for death 
in his speech the second this week to hit dukakis on defense 
quayle said the massachusetts governor did not understand the need 
for such weapons as the mx and midgetman missiles and for the star 
wars spacebased missile defense system 
the proposed defense shield said quayle is a moral superior 
way of defending america 
bush like the soviets understands the importance of a missile 
defense system quayle said 
george bush doesnt need a primer on national security 
neither do i quayle said 
quayle toured norad the north american aerospace defense 
command center near colorado springs he received a briefing on the 
system which provides a warning in the event of space missile or 
air attack on north america 
the senator saw a simulated attack by the soviets and how we 
would handle that said gen john piotrowski the norad commander 
the demonstration took place in the steel buildings embedded 
under 1700 feet of granite at cheyenne mountain 
the news media were barred from entering the norad complex 
piotrowski said because of a federal law which bars political 
campaigning at military installations 
at a rally later at a colorado springs airport hangar quayle 
was heckled by demonstrators who held signs reading students 
unite against bushquayle and who chanted where was dan as 
he began to speak 
gesturing to the protesters quayle said some of those they 
keep walking around in circles we have a message to talk about 
the people that they support michael dukakis he doesnt have a 
message he doesnt have any ideas he doesnt know where to lead 
this country 
he got on a tank i saw the other day quayle said glad 
he knows what one looks like 
the combination of heckling from the crowd and dukakisbaiting 
by quayle continued at the new mexico state fair in alburquerque 
where dukakis supporters chanting go home quayle shouted 
throughout quayles speech 
as you listen to this babble over here you cant help but 
think of the dukakis positions quayle said they have no 
positions theyre loud but they dont have any ideas 
i understand you have a balloon festival coming up the 
governor of massachusetts has a lot of hot air why dont you 
invite him

confessed hijacker mohammed ali 
hamadi denied wednesday that he headed the 1985 twa hijacking that 
claimed the life of a us navy diver and kept 39 americans captive 
for 17 days 
hamadi on wednesday also accused witnesses of giving false 
testimony after some said he gloated over the killing of an 
american passenger 
the testimony very often deviates far from the truth hamadi 
told the court i was not the leader of the commando 
flight engineer benjamin zimmermann said on tuesday that hamadi 
pointed with pride to blood stains of murdered us navy diver 
robert stethem on the airplane fuselage 
hamadi also said someone else ordered the hijacking but when 
asked by chief judge heiner mueckenberger he refused to name the 
man he said ordered it 
the one who gave us the orders came on board after beirut two 
and took over the command hamadi said referring to the second 
time the plane landed in lebanon 
he said the man spoke english well and boarded the plane with 
shiite moslem amal militiamen in beirut after stethem was slain 
twa flight 847 pilot john testrake this week identified hamadi 
as the hijacker who shot stethem to death hamadi has admitted 
taking part in the hijacking but has denied killing stethem 
the flight from athens to rome was hijacked june 14 1985 and 
first diverted to beirut 
witnesses have testified that the situation became more relaxed 
on board the plane after the amal militia arrived negotiations 
with the hijackers also improved members of the flight crew said 
hamadi also told the court that hand grenades carried by the 
hijackers had been defused 
we did not want to blow up the plane we were worried that 
someone would make a wrong move cause the grenades to fall and 
explode and crash the plane hamadi said 
hamadi disputed other testimony that he had gone to the toilet 
of the aircraft to get arms smuggled onboard the plane 
the other one went to the toilet i sat in the window seat and 
talked with the first witness hamadi said referring to former 
hostage peter hill 
hill testified earlier that he sat next to hamadi and the other 
hijacker and that hamadi was the one who went for the weapons 
witnesses have said they heard the crash of glass when one of 
the hijackers went to the toilet to get the weapons 
they said they believed the weapons had been concealed in a 
glass container 
examination of glass shards from the plane revealed they did not 
contain enough lead to have foiled xray security checks according 
to court evidence 
after briefly answering questions hamadi told the court he had 
only intended to make a statement and was not prepared to answer 
any further questions 
in other testimony wednesday fbi agent gary noesner said his 
office opened its investigation the day the hijacking began 
he said the fbi had assembled substantial evidence in the case 
but much of it was not released for security reasons he said 
essential evidence was given to west german investigators 
we of course identified mohammed hamadi as being one of the 
hijackers noesner said he added the two other suspects who are 
still at large had also been identified and charged in the united 
states 
he said hamadi was identified by pictures and that suspected 
hijackers hassan izzedine and ali atwa was identified through 
pictures and a number of reliable sources i cannot disclose 
but noesner told the court that fingerprints found on the twa 
airliner during the investigation were not hamadis 
he said the plane was in poor condition and that attempts were 
made to clean it apparently to get rid of fingerprints and other 
evidence 
the aircraft was returned to rome from beirut on aug 14 1985 
nearly two months after the hijacking 
other evidence found on the airplane included blood stains 
near the door and ak47 bullet hulls noesner said 
the court recessed until sept 20 when another member of the 
flight crew is scheduled to testify

israeli leaders on wednesday spurned the latest 
overture by plo leader yasser arafat who used the hebrew greeting 
shana tova to wish israelis a happy new year on the jewish 
holiday 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip troops shot and 
wounded 20 palestinians hospital officials said the army 
confirmed 13 casualties among demonstrators 
masked assailants in the west bank city of nablus stabbed to 
death an arab suspected of collaborating with israel 
arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization used 
the hebrew greeting the equivalent of happy new year at a news 
conference in strasbourg france on wednesday a day after he 
addressed socialist members of the european parliament 
in his speech arafat said the plo was working toward the 
establishment of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza 
strip and accepted all un resolutions including 242 and 338 
which recognize israels right to exist 
reaction by top israelis was icy 
it is a new years blessing calling for the destruction of the 
state of israel said moshe arens head of the rightwing likud 
blocs campaign for the nov 1 general elections 
defense minister yitzhak rabin of the leftofcenter labor party 
told supporters at a campaign rally in jerusalem that the plo is 
not a partner for talks 
seven weeks have gone by since king hussein of jordan 
announced he was cutting his links with the west bank and handing 
over responsibility to the plo said rabin the plo is incapable 
of taking up the challenge even in words 
foreign minister shimon peres labors leader criticized 
european parliament legislators for receiving arafat 
all of sudden they started one more time to fall in love with 
the plo peres told israel radio from london where he met on 
wednesday with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
peres said he was reassured by mrs thatcher he said she 
objects vigorously to the creation of a palestinian state in 
exile 
palestinian leaders appeared split over arafats statements 
hathem abu ghazale a prominent plo supporter in the west bank 
said arafats visit is a palestinian breakthrough in the 
countries where the zionist movement was born and later developed 
but deposed gaza city mayor rashad shawwa said arafat was 
running around in empty circles 
plo hardliners and moslem fundamentalist groups oppose a 
unilateral declaration of a palestinian governmentinexile because 
it would imply recognition of israel 
israeli peace activist abie nathan who defied israeli law to 
meet arafat in tunis this week told israel television from 
strasbourg the plo was ready to negotiate peace with israel 
i believe that today we are closer to peace than ever 
before nathan said 
palestinian youths on wednesday stoned israeli troops and burned 
tires in the gaza strip refugee camps of khan yunis and shati 
troop gunfire wounded nine palestinians in khan yunis and seven 
in shati including two teenagers who were in serious condition

khan yunis and three in shati 
in the west bank village of beit lid near tulkarem soldiers 
fired to disperse villagers resisting an army raid an army 
official said three palestinians were wounded and several 
palestinians were arrested he said 
another palestinian was wounded in a clash in the west bank 
village burquin near nablus hospital officials said 
assailants dragged 30yearold palestinian adli thalga from his 
nablus home and stabbed him to death he allegedly collaborated 
with israeli authorities 
seven palestinians accused of cooperating with israel have been 
killed the palestinian rebellion began on dec 8 in the 
israelioccupied territories the uprising has claimed the lives of 
265 palestinians and six israelis 
thalga was the fifth alleged collaborator to be killed in 10 
days following a call from palestinian uprising leaders to rid 
ourselves of collaborators 
rabin meanwhile attacked proposals raised by some likud 
politicians to annex large parts of the west bank saying it would 
turn israel into a racist apartheid state 
racism and judaism dont go together he said 
but rabin said israel would not hand back all lands captured in 
the 1967 middle east war

they sleep on the ground after 24 
hours or more of potentially deadly work gobble cold food when 
they get the chance and shower off layers of sweatstreaked dirt 
every few days 
but firefighters say they love their jobs 
its action carving bareearth control lines with shovels or 
bulldozers dousing flames with hoses piloting helicopters that 
drop water from buckets its better than some boring job they 
say or just sitting around at a fire station 
and they add their efforts are usually appreciated 
a sign at an entrance to a firefighters camp at the nevada 
county fairgrounds wednesday said we love you firefighters 
red hearts were plastered around the message to nearly 3000 
firefighters who began battling a huge blaze sunday near this gold 
country community 45 miles northeast of sacramento 
im going to make a career out of firefighting said david 
mclean 25 who drives a fire engine during the summer for the 
california department of forestry i like the outdoors and i like 
the action i love it 
mclean and his crew of seasonal firefighters from el dorado 
county were among state forces from throughout central california 
that first attacked the 49er fire which burned more than 
30000 acres in four days razing nearly 100 homes 
we worked almost 40 hours straight from sunday morning to 
monday night we ate crations when we had the time and finally got 
our first hot meal after we were relieved and sent to fire camp 
said mclean who is a santa cruz carpenter in the offseason 
then i got my first shower in a couple days he said 
after that long its always the best shower of your life 
like most others at the sprawling camp mclean and his crew 
bedded down in paper sleeping bags on the ground with clothing for 
pillows 
among those sprawled across the grass and draped on fire trucks 
from state federal and local agencies were plenty of female 
firefighters 
forestry department seasonal firefighter talley tarris 23 of 
sacramento said shes often asked why a woman would want to battle 
flames 
i like being grimy and not sleeping she said laughing 
were one big happy family tarris added 
not everyone fighting fires has it as rough as the ground troops 
the crews that operate helicopters which carry water in buckets 
to douse hot spots were based next to the firefighters camp but 
slept 30 miles away in a motel so they would be properly rested 
even those crews dont always take advantage of the 
comparatively posh arrangement however 
sometimes its more of a pain to go in to a motel than its 
worth said pilot jim ramage of redding then we just sleep on 
the ground too

a littleknown group claimed wednesday 
that an american who escaped abduction in east lebanon this week 
was a cia agent and that he was freed intentionally 
lebanon radio and us officials have said kenneth p wells 25 
was an american engineer who overpowered his captors after he was 
kidnapped on sunday he reportely works in saudi arabia for litton 
industries and holds a black belt in karate 
the group calling itself the national progressive alliance 
claimed it captured wells because he was on an espionage mission 
and then released him the claims were in a note delivered to the 
west beirut office of the italian ansa news agency and were 
accompanied by photos of wells us drivers license and his saudi 
arabian work permit 
it was the first known statement from the previously unheard of 
group an ansa employee said the note was found in a white envelope 
left at the doorstep of the agency office after someone rang the 
doorbell and left 
wells was abducted briefly with his new shiite moslem bride 
nadia haydar sharafeddine shortly after the couple wed sunday in 
east lebanons ancient city of baalbek 
but reports varied as to how the couple gained freedom 
lebanese press reports monday said wells used karate to disarm 
his captives and escape 
syrian government sources said the syrian troops who control 
east lebanons bekaa valley rescued the couple after a nightlong 
search and took them to the syrian capital of damascus where they 
were turned over to the us embassy 
in recent days cia col kenneth paul wells sneaked into the 
territory of our beloved country on an open spying mission for a 
whole month under the pretext of marrying a lebanese said the 
statement from the group 
our courageous strugglers however were alert they chased 
him arrested him interrogated him and warned him to leave lebanon 
at once then they freed him hoping that the americans will get 
the message that we emphatically reject their overt interference in 
our internal affairs the statement added 
it accused the united states of harboring animosity to our 
nationalist causes and supporting the enemies of our people and the 
arab nation 
the statement also expressed support for syrian president hafez 
assad 
the language of the statement suggests the group behind it may 
be leftist rather than the proiranian shiite extremists believed 
to be holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in lebanon

several thousand people wednesday evacuated the marshy 
floodprone coast of texas and louisiana as hurricane gilbert 
churned into the gulf of mexico packing twice the power of last 
weeks hurricane florence 
this is very very serious said wendell curole hurricane 
coordinator for lafourche parish on the louisiana coast gilbert 
is a killer storm something a lot of people have never 
experienced even in this area 
gilbert already blamed for at least 11 deaths in the caribbean 
was on a path toward texas wednesday afternoon forecasters said as 
the national weather service issued a hurricane watch for the 
states entire coastline but with the unpredictable storm three 
days away authorities met to review evacuation plans across 
hundreds of miles from the southern tip of texas to new orleans 
on the bolivar peninsula outside galveston bay beachgoers and 
about 3000 residents were urged to leave by sundown and most were 
cooperating said police chief farris collier of crystal beach 
the 1600 students of the university of texas medical branch on 
galveston island and about 200 patients also were being evacuated 
said spokeswoman leann teymour 
the army was setting up a crisis action center in washington 
to coordinate dispatching activeduty military personnel and 
equipment from fort hood in killeen texas and possibly fort bliss 
in el paso to assist with evacuations said sen phil gramm 
rtexas 
andy valence mayor of the barrier island town of grand isle 
la about 80 miles south of new orleans ordered a general 
evacuation of the islands 2100 residents and visitors 
mississippis gulf coast residents kept officials busy answering 
phone calls about gilberts path 
i think people are concerned particularly after the close 
call with hurricane florence last week said dusty perkins 
public information officer for the jacksonbased mississippi 
emergency management agency 
tampa bay area officials still mopping up from four days of 
torrential rains last week worried that floridas central gulf 
coast communities were especially vulnerable to gilbert 
the ground remained waterlogged said bob anderson sarasota 
countys deputy director of emergency management and floodwaters 
blocked the only two roads from manatee countys barrier islands 
and other evacuation routes 
gilbert is a much larger and more dangerous storm than florence 
which hit southeastern louisiana friday night flooding roads and 
knocking down power lines but doing little major damage 
youve got tropical gale force winds all the way out 250 
miles from the eye of the hurricane said bruce piercy of the 
national weather service in miami 
evacuations started earlier this week when oil companies used 
helicopters and crew boats to take an estimated 10000 workers from 
offshore rigs 
more evacuation orders were likely thursday morning even if the 
storms path remains uncertain authorities said 
you cannot evacuate people at night and you cant evacuate 
people when the winds and rain have already started said port 
arthur texas police lt bd spradlin 
grocery and hardware stores were swamped with shoppers and 
lumber and water supplies were reported in short supply throughout 
the region 
new orleans residents lined up 10 to 15 deep at check out lanes 
in one hardware store where plywood for covering windows was the 
hot selling item 
a caravan of cattle trucks jammed a twolane road out of coastal 
cameron parish la where purebreds graze in the lush marshland 
in corpus christi texas school was canceled for the rest of 
the week in the nearby beach resort of port aransas officials 
handed out emergency passes to residents leaving town to control 
access and prevent looting in the event of a disaster 
most of the damage would be to homes and lowrise buildings 
which are generally designed to withstand winds of up to 90100 
mph said kishor mehta president of the wind engineering research 
council and an associate at texas tech universitys institute for 
disaster research 
gilbert could easily cause damage in the neighborhood of 5 
billion to 7 billion if it hits the right place mehta said 
uhaul marketing co president alan kirkhart described the scene 
at the selfservice rental center in corpus christi where his 
office is located 
its almost like a mass panic situation kirkhart said we 
have so many people calling and coming in here that we had to start 
a waiting list and it keeps growing before we can get more 
equipment in 
because of a shortage of lumber he said some corpus christi 
residents have driven as far as austin and san antonio to rent 
trucks and trailers bringing plywood back with them to board up 
homes prior to evacuating

plo leader yasser arafat on wednesday 
wished israel happy new year in hebrew but israeli officials 
dismissed it as a public relations ploy 
arafat also got a message from another quarter wednesday king 
hussein of jordan hussein said that since his kingdom cut ties 
with the israelioccupied west bank on july 30 it is up to the 
palestinians to solve their own problems and they have no one to 
blame but themselves if they fail 
arafat addressing abie nathan a controversial israeli radio 
personality and peace crusader said at a news conference earlier 
wednesday 
i ask you to tell all israelis and all jews shana tova 
on this occasion of the jewish new year 
when i say shana tova i mean in particular a peaceful new 
year said the chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
a peaceful new year for all of our children for all of our 
peoples for the whole of the arab region 
jews throughout the world at sundown tuesday ended celebrations 
ushering in rosh hashana the jewish new year 
speaking in arabic through interpreters arafat addressed 
reporters on the last day of a twoday visit to the european 
parliament at the invitation of the bodys socialist group 
arafat said the willingness of european and other governments to 
recognize a provisional palestinian government on the west bank 
would influence a decision to establish such a government 
he urged the united states to be more fair towards the 
palestinians 
the united states has to stand for justice and fairness and 
should not just think of electoral considerations he said 
an israeli foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said arafats new year greeting was a stunt 
its very nice to say shana tova in front of a group of 
journalists but it would be more constructive if in his speech 
yesterday there were some concrete change in policy the official 
said 
he was referring to a meeting tuesday in which arafat told the 
european parliaments socialists that jordans decision to cut its 
ties to the west bank would pave the way for an independent 
palestinian state 
israeli officials reject such a state 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said arafats gesture would not change the rightwing likud partys 
opposition to holding talks with the plo 
we will not be misled by the lip service of mr arafat and 
seeming gestures like wishing shana tova to our people ahimeir 
said 
arafat said the palestine national council the palestinians 
parliamentinexile will make a final decision next month on a 
provisional government or place the occupied territories under un 
trusteeship 
king husseins remarks came during a taped interview with the 
world monitor television program in london 
in the interview broadcast wednesday and monitored in boston 
hussein said he did not believe a jordanian option now existed 
in dealing with the palestinian question 
the monarch said that while jordan remained committed to 
the cause of a just and durable peace as far as the palestinian 
dimension is concerned the palestinian problem is in the hands of 
the palestinians 
he said he hoped that the israelis now would realize that 
there has to be a facing of reality and come up with their 
contribution for the establishment of a just and good peace in the 
area 
hussein said jordan would attend an international middle east 
peace conference only if asked to do so by the plo and well 
have to look at it then 
when asked if he thought whether arafats organization was 
moving in the right direction hussein replied well there is 
certainly no other quarter to blame if they fail to do so 
he said the plo claims to be the sole legitimate 
representative of the palestinian people and i believe its going 
to be up to it to prove that this is the case ideally it should 
be a simultaneous kind of recognition israel recognizing the 
palestinians and their rights on their soil and the 
palestinians acting in a way that would recognize israels right to 
exist on its soil 
he said that if the palestinian uprising in the occupied lands 
continues to a point when all hope is lost then its downhill 
and into an abyss nobody can forecast what can happen

south african police wednesday attacked 
hijackers holding a busload of pilgrims going to see pope john paul 
ii and said three hijackers and a young woman hostage were killed 
during the rescue 
eleven passengers were wounded the remainder were freed and a 
fourth hijacker was arrested south african police headquarters 
said 
lesotho government officials said 71 hostages were in the bus 
the military government of lesotho a black kingdom that lies 
inside south africas borders requested south african help in 
handling the hijacking 
there was no immediate government statement on the shootout 
police said the shootout took place when the hijackers tried to 
drive the bus through the closed gates of the british high 
commission or embassy in maseru 
reporters were barred from the area at the time of the shootout 
but later they saw the bus its windows shot out lying wrecked in 
the high commission courtyard just inside the gate 
south african police said officers returned fire after the 
hijackers began shooting 
police said the hostage casualties were apparently caused by 
the wild firing of the hijackers they said no policemen were 
injured 
the shooting broke out about 20 minutes after the pope arrived 
in maseru eight hours behind schedule the hijackers earlier 
demanded to meet with the pope and lesothos king moshoeshoe ii a 
government official said 
after nightfall gunfire and explosions were heard at the site 
where the bus was parked and flares lit up the sky 
reporters were blocked from getting close enough to the scene to 
see the shootout but they saw ambulances taking casualties to a 
hospital 
police ordered journalists at the scene to disperse and then 
chased them away with whips 
the pope arrived in this mountain kingdom after an overland 
journey from johannesburg where bad weather forced his plane to 
make an unscheduled landing john paul met foreign minister pik 
botha at the airport and was briefed about the hijacking before 
leaving for lesotho 
staterun lesotho radio said there were about 70 hostages 
including eight nuns 36 children 16 women and 10 men 
one nun is from canada and the rest of the hostages are from 
lesotho said tom thabane secretary for lesothos sixman ruling 
military council 
one man escaped wednesday from the bus 
armed security forces from both lesotho and south africa 
surrounded the bus botha said lesotho authorities had asked for 
help with security and that south african personnel were in 
attendance to render advice 
thabane said the hijackers belonged to the guerrilla lesotho 
liberation army he said the government has no intention of 
meeting the demands of terrorists 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said a man 
claiming to be a spokesman for the guerrilla group telephoned its 
bloemfontein south africa office and denied responsibility for 
the hijacking 
the four hijackers posed as pilgrims when they boarded the bus 
tuesday at the start of its journey from rural lesotho said police 
commissioner james dingiswayo they then took over the bus 
announced they were from the lesotho liberation army and said 
anyone who resisted would be killed he said 
lesotho radio said the hijackers were armed with an automatic 
rifle a pistol and two grenades the radio said the hijackers had 
gone to the british mission because britain the former colonial 
power in lesotho was training the countrys army and police force 
their request to meet high commissioner john edwards was refused 
the radio said the hijackers asked wednesday that a catholic 
priest be taken to the bus unofficial sources said they believed 
the priest would open negotiations between the hijackers and 
lesothos military rulers 
about 100 soldiers and police set up roadblocks with armored 
cars and kept spectators four blocks away 
gervase chevasse deputy british high commissioner said the bus 
pulled up outside the high commission tuesday evening he said the 
hijackers asked to enter the compound but were rebuffed 
the lesotho liberation army was opposed to the leftist 
government of the late prime minister leabua jonathan several 
bombings and killings were blamed on the group which reportedly 
had south african backing 
the guerrillas left the mountain kingdom after a january 1986 
coup deposed jonathan and installed a military government more 
favorable to south africa they reportedly have been seeking to 
restore relations with the military rulers 
a nun at the papal visit office sister rita brassard said the 
bus came from quachas nek a remote town in southern lesotho the 
country is surrounded by south africa 
lesotho a nation of about 16 million people is officially a 
constitutional monarchy but is ruled by the military council in 
consultation with the king lesotho achieved independence from 
britain in 1966

yoko ono widow of slain rock star john lennon 
dismissed author albert goldmans controversial version of the 
couples life together and apart as totally fiction wednesday 
in a nationally broadcast radio show 
these people in this book are not us its not john and me 
ono said in her first broadcast comments on the lives of john 
lennon biography its unfair hes been assaulted and cant 
hit back 
the rare appearance wednesday night by ono was prompted by 
goldmans 719page biography of the exbeatle which presents him as 
an anorexic bisexual drugaddicted drunk who wanted to dump his 
wife 
ono doesnt fare much better goldman presents her as a 
golddigger who snorted heroin up to the time of lennons death and 
had several affairs while they were married goldman also charges 
she was responsible for paul mccartneys 1980 marijuana bust in 
japan and was just as intent on a divorce as lennon 
ono denied virtually all of these charges and countered through 
taped interviews with lennon friends and employees that goldmans 
book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes 
for some reason this book is attempting to rob both john and i 
of the basic human dignity that were entitled to she said 
shortly after the broadcast opened with lennons song gimme some 
truth 
its amazing that somebody took such a poetic license i dont 
see john in there its a very dramatically described 
something but its not about john said ono its totally 
fiction 
the onehour broadcast was taped aug 28 at the dakota where 
the lennons lived and yoko still lives in manhattan the 
broadcast coincides with the books official release date which 
was also on wednesday 
lennon was fatally shot by mark david chapman outside the dakota 
on dec 8 1980 
the ono interview was broadcast nationwide via the westwood one 
network spokeswoman laurie wilde said a total number of the 
stations picking up the broadcast was not available 
appearing with ono were lennons sons julian and sean ono is 
interviewed by longtime associate elliot mintz described in 
goldmans book as a spy for yoko 
it is for one very upsetting but most of all it is lies 
untruths the whole thing is just sickening said julian who 
also denied goldmans stories about lennon as a terrifying father 
mintz read excerpts from the goldman book to yoko who then 
responded to the allegations made by the author point by point she 
denied lennon was a homosexual denied he was using drugs while 
living at the dakota with his son sean denied he had become a 
reclusive rock n roll howard hughes 
she did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 
1970s but rejected goldmans assertion that she had a 
5000aweek habit 
the book already has drawn angry responses from friends of 
lennon and ono mccartney who denied one anecdote involving a 
violent lennon smashing a painting in pauls home has urged a 
boycott of the book 
after onos rebuttal listeners were invited to dial 900 
telephone numbers to vote on whether the goldman book is an 
accurate portrayal of the lennons life results were not expected 
until thursday 
goldman who conducted more than 1200 interviews for his lennon 
book has previously written controversial biographies of comedian 
lenny bruce and elvis presley

its hard to get through the night when your man 
has done you wrong and then gone so wail the three lonely ladies 
of blues in the night a minor musical meditation on the blues 
that opened wednesday at offbroadways minetta lane theater 
the show is a recast slightly revised revival of the musical 
revue that had a 53performance run on broadway in 1982 this new 
version had some success in london before resurfacing in new york 
with a cast that includes brenda pressley leilani jones and from 
the british production carol woods 
despite the classy performers its difficult to work up much 
enthusiasm for the show blues in the night is a strange 
anonymous musical with a onenote message and characters that 
rarely connect with each other much less the audience 
its women worn down by men and by life are identified only as 
the lady from the road the woman of the world and the girl with a 
date they occupy separate rooms in a cheap hotel in some unknown 
city the time is the late 1930s and the hour of course is after 
midnight 
the songs are distinctive most of them wellknown classics but 
the themes they express are basically the same the numbers 
expertly played by a fivepiece band perched above the hotel 
setting usually fall into two categories theres the bluesy 
lament for all those men who got away and dirty doubleentendre 
ditties like kitchen man or take me for a buggy ride 
performed with gusto by the formidable miss woods 
each member of the cast including lawrence hamilton as the 
evenings generic man gets a song or two in which they shine 
miss woods pretty much tears down the place with bessie smiths 
wasted life blues hitting an intensity thats rarely matched 
by the rest of the production the singer also sasses her way 
through a vaudeville number called new orleans hop scop blues 
that demonstrates her olympicclass sense of timing 
as the allpurpose woman of the world the cool miss pressley is 
a revelation a sleek sexy songstress she projects elegance and 
high style she can move too particularly in the old benny goodman 
number stompin at the savoy and in a wild defiant take it 
right back that concludes the first act 
miss jones as the stereotypical girl on a date has a harder 
time because she has the least interesting songs particularly a 
bland version of willow weep for me when she is allowed to 
torch her material particularly a song like reckless blues 
the woman can sizzle 
hamiltons role is even less defined he wanders in and out of 
these melodic tribulations occasionally the performer even 
comments on these downandout dames particularly in a sardonic 
number wild women dont have the blues or on himself in a song 
like duke ellingtons im just a lucky soandso 
sheldon epps who created and directed the show has boxed the 
musical into a corner the songs pile on top of each other 
allowing for little emotional variation their sheer number gives 
the evening the blues 
blues in the night is best savored for the individual star 
turns taken as a full evening of theater the production proves to 
be a tad wearyin

a 24yearold artist from arkansas was shot to 
death wednesday near the campus of an art institute in brooklyn 
where she came to study a week ago

with a high rate of violent crime 
ms wrappe spent the summer with a brother in washington dc 
working three jobs to save money for school her mother said 
judith was just pursuing her dream of studying art in new 
york said her mother sue wrape in a tearful telephone interview 
ms wrappe a 1987 notre dame graduate who spelled her name 
differently from her parents had just finished her first night 
working as a waitress at a manhattan restaurant said manager mark 
shay 
detectives believe she took the subway to brooklyn and was one 
block away from the apartment she had rented with three other 
students when she was approached prestia said 
there was some kind of a struggle between the fellow and the 
victim she had shouted out leave me alone when he fired one 
shot hit her in the chest and escaped with the handbag prestia 
said 
during the commotion a resident of a nearby building had yelled 
out the window at the gunman to leave her alone prestia added 
it was just shortly after that that he fired the shot 
the handbag was recovered nearby and it was not known if 
anything was taken 
shay said he hired the student artist monday during her first 
shift she did mention to someone here that it was a culture 
shock moving from arkansas to new york city the restaurant 
manager said 
its embarrassing as a new yorker to have someone come from 
out of state and meet an untimely death at a young age shay 
said it doesnt say much for new york city to the people of 
arkansas 
ms wrappe is survived by her mother and father jarrell v 
wrape and four brothers and a sister who ranged in age from 22 to

george bush said wednesday that american flags have sold more 
briskly since republicans began restoring pride in the country 
in 1981 michael dukakis stressed support for some weapons and 
muted earlier opposition to others as he sought to blunt attacks on 
his defense credentials 
bush also touted smaller than expected trade deficit figures and 
dukakis accused the republicans of opposing every single effort 
to reform the pentagon while their managers fleshed out details on 
the campaign debates that are expected to be pivotal in the close 
race for the white house 
officials said that vice presidential candidates dan quayle and 
lloyd bentsen would hold their only debate of the fall on oct 5 in 
omaha neb los angeles was fixed as the site of the second and 
final bushdukakis debate on either oct 13 or 14 
the two contenders for the white house square off a week from 
sunday in winstonsalem nc in their first debate of the 
campaign 
said bush ive been looking forward to it 
but dukakis went to annapolis md which was to have hosted a 
debate wednesday night and taunted the vice president for his 
refusal to make it a date if george bush isnt ready today after 
seven and a half years as vice president of this country how can 
we expect him to be ready on jan 20 1989 the democrat said 
public opinion polls in recent days have shown bush holding a 
singledigit lead and democratic aides said privately they didnt 
look for much change in the 10 days before the debates begin 
however a washington postabc news released wednesday showed 
the two candidates essentially tied with dukakis leading 4845 
the survey of 1092 likely voters had a threepoint margin of 
error the survey concluded two days after the recent surveys 
the vice president said some polls were good and others werent 
they cancel out 
and he did wooing hispanic and asian voters in a tour of 
california the biggest prize with 47 electoral votes the vice 
president said joblessness among hispanics has fallen almost twice 
as fast under president reagan as when the democrats were in the 
white house 
bush said there was new pride in america demonstrated by the 
performance of a flagmaking company in new jersey 
under the democratic administration of jimmy carter he said 
they werent selling that well 
well since we began restoring pride in the united states of 
america business has been booming he said without naming the 
company 
later bush said he opposed a grape boycott being led by farm 
workers union official cesar chavez and said that was a big 
difference between himself and the liberal governor of 
massachusetts 
standing in a field in the san joaquin valley surrounded by 
fruit crates bush noted figures showing that the trade deficit 
fell to a smaller than expected 953 billion in july we are 
moving in the right direction he said 
capping the day in san francisco bush was feted at a colorful 
rally in a chinatown park but about 400 demonstrators gathered in 
union square across the luxury st francis hotel where he was to 
deliver a speech 
at one point before bush arrived protesters began spilling out 
into the street crossing barricades stopping traffic and the 
citys famed cable cars police led several away and at least one 
person arrested 
dukakis supporters passed out antibush fortune cookies in 
chinatown but bushs hosts countered with a huge fortune cookie 
containing the message november brings good fortune 
only one person only one person can carry americas peace 
and prosperity into the 1990s bush said describing himself as 
that person 
reagan added a few wellaimed barbs at the democrats during the 
day when he said the opposition was to blame for economic and 
foreign policy nightmares 
the truth is that when you take a walk down our oppositions 
memory lane it starts to look like nightmare on elm street 
the president said on a campaign trip to missouri 
the massachusetts governor portrayed by bush as weak on defense 
matters said in a speech at georgetown university in washington 
that he would use force when its necessary to protect our 
territory our citizens or our vital interests to meet our treaty 
commitments and to deter or to respond to terrorist attacks 
he offered no specifics nor did he reply to bushs challenge 
repeated during the day in california to say whether he favored 
the us invasion of grenada in 1983 or the bombing of libya in 
1985 
dukakis listed the stealth bomber the trident ii seabased 
missile the advanced cruise missile the advanced tactical 
fighter a new attack submarine and a new antitank weapon as 
systems he favors he criticized the mx missile which bush favors 
as a smoke and mirrors proposal 
his speech also reflected the softening in his earlier adamant 
opposition to the proposed star wars spacebased defense shield he 
repeated his statement from last week that he wants 1 billion a 
year for continued research and would consider deploying the system 
under some circumstances 
dukakis has opposed the midgetman missile in the past but in 
his speech said the strategic conceptis sound but i question 
the value of spending 40 billion or 50 billion for 500 landbased 
missile warheads 
dukakis also charged the reagan administration with neglecting 
conventional weapons and bentsen sounded a similar theme as he 
donned a leather flight jacket and fired up a singleengine trainer 
at an airplane museum 
under this administration buck rogers has been promoted and 
our conventional forces have been neglected said bentsen who 
was a world war ii bomber pilot 
quayle toured the norad missile warning center in cheyenne 
mountain near colorado springs colo and later strongly defended 
the star wars program as a moral superior way of defending 
america

the senate abandoned an effort to expand 
federal coverage for medicaid abortions in the face of strong 
opposition from the house and the white house 
the senate in july had voted 7319 to allow federal financing 
for medicaid abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest 
but it backed down on tuesday in a bow to political reality 
under current law federal spending for medicaid abortions is 
permitted only if the procedure is needed to save a womans life 
the house reaffirmed its support for that policy last week and in 
the process rejected the senates proposal for rape and incest 
exceptions 
president reagan had promised to veto a 140 billion spending 
bill containing all the fiscal 1989 money for the departments of

fawn hall and donna rice didnt paula parkinson 
jessica hahn rita jenrette and debra murphree did 
getting scandalentangled women to bare all is a major coup for 
mens magazines which pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to 
titillate 
besides dangling sixfigure fees such magazines as playboy and 
penthouse wine and dine these formerly obscure women and offer the 
promise of nationwide publicity the reason is simple scandal 
sells 
women or even men who are at the center of a storm of any 
kind are always bestsellers said penthouse publisher bob 
guccione 
when indiana sen dan quayle was chosen as the republican vice 
presidential candidate penthouse and playboy rushed to resurrect 
features on paula parkinson the comely blond lobbyist who 
accompanied quayle and two other politicians on a golf outing eight 
years ago 
playboys november issue includes new coments from parkinson 
claiming quayle propositioned her on the florida weekend and a 
nude photograph of parkinson taken in 1980 
penthouses story also for november includes fresh remarks 
from a 1981 interview about an alleged dalliance with rep jack 
kemp rny as well as statements about quayle 
the idea behind this is to get somebody whos in the public 
eye and show something about that person that you cant find 
any place else said nat lehrman a former playboy publishing 
executive and now chairman of columbia colleges journalism school 
here 
jessica hahn the former church secretary whose sexual encounter 
with jim bakker led to the ptl evangelists downfall last year got 
her second playboy feature in the september issue 
her first spread appeared in playboys november 1987 issue 
featuring several nude photographs and hahns version of what 
happened with bakker the issue sold more than 5 million copies at 
newsstands about 15 million more than usual 
hahn contends penthouse offered her 12 million to appear she 
chose instead to tell her story to playboy for a rumored 1 million 
playboy approached me and penthouse too pretty much when the 
story broke hahn 29 said in a telephone interview from 
phoenix where shes working in radio 
penthouse she said was making a lot of promises that they 
could not keep the money was endless i mean it was ridiculous 
playboy contends hahn and an agent first approached the 
magazine which hahn denies regardless of who made the first move 
playboy acknowledges she was a big catch 
if there is another magazine out there that we feel 
competitive with we try to get our offer on the table first 
and i think there was probably some of that that went on with 
jessica hahn said jeff cohen managing photo editor for playboy 
penthouse struck it rich with its july issue featuring the 
woman at the center of the scandal involving televangelist jimmy 
swaggart the magazine includes explicit photos of debra murphree 
showing the things she contends swaggart asked her to do in a motel 
room 
the murphree issue sold out in five days selling more than 4 
million copies double the normal newsstand sales according to 
penthouse officials 
guccione and an attorney for murphree declined to reveal how 
much she was paid but it was rumored to be 75000 to 100000 
murphree jailed in louisiana on an unrelated prostitution 
charge was not available for comment her attorney tom weymann 
explained her motivation 
primarily she was trying to get out of the life that she had 
found herself in there was the motivation of not only the money 
but also to set the record straight of exactly what happened he 
said 
scandals especially those involving sex are guaranteed hits 
for magazines because the public wants to see the naked woman who 
played delilah to whatever samson of the moment said barry 
blackman a new york photographer blackmans photographs of 
elizabeth ray the nontyping secretary and exmistress of former 
ohio rep wayne hayes wound up in hustler magazine 
nude photos of ray also appeared in penthouse and playboy 
but capitalizing on scandals can be tricky said nancie s 
martin editor in chief of playgirl magazine you have to get to 
people at the right time you have to pay them a lot of money you 
have to hope its still a scandal when the magazine comes out 
theres always the concern that it might be exploitive that 
you might be taking somebody involved in a sex scandal and giving 
them more limelight than they deserve she said 
often posing nude is a way for women linked to scandal to 
create or advance careers said martin but why would someone like 
rita jenrette exwife of former south carolina congressman john 
jenrette want to bare her body to millions 
i thought it would be a hoot a funny thing to do said 
jenrette 38 who appreared in playboy in april 1981 after her 
husbands bribery and conspiracy conviction in the fbi abscam 
investigation 
people caught in the midst of turmoil you do a lot of 
uncharacteristic things said jenrette now living in new york 
and pursuing an acting career i never anticipated the 
criticism 
she said a washington reporter and his wife persuaded her to 
pose and playboy says it willingly agreed 
there is a curiosity about these people that the other news 
media pick up rita jenrette was everywhere cohen said but 
we had her story and we had glamorous nude photographs of her 
the issue featuring jenrette sold a little more than 62 million 
copies more than a million over normal sales of the time 
it was one of our biggest sellers cohen said 
jenrette says she doesnt think playboy exploited her troubles 
to make a buck 
as far as mens magazines making money off the scandal she 
said what else is there it sells the sensational grabs 
people 
thats why playboy and penthouse offering sixfigure payoffs 
hotly pursued donna rice whose relationship with former colorado 
sen gary hart doomed his presidential hopes and fawn hall the 
blond national security council secretary who helped oliver north 
shred and alter documents about arms deals in the irancontra 
scandal 
donna rice i think we were close to making a deal with at one 
point said playboys cohen nudity was discussed she just 
walked away from it there were several conversations with her 
lunches but no deal was made why she turned us down i dont 
know 
fawn hall would have certainly been a cover story would 
have sold well cohen said 
playboy would not disclose their offers but guccione said 
penthouse offered rice about 350000 and hall 250000 because 
anybody in the country would want to read about them 
halls attorney plato cacheris said he understood the interest 
in his client 
but the money did not tempt her he said shes too much 
of a lady and shes not going to try to capitalize in any 
unseemly way 
rice could not be reached and her miami attorney thomas 
mcaliley was vacationing and unavailable to explain why she 
rejected the offers 
should she or hall have second thoughts it may be too late 
the timing is allimportant said cohen right now i 
dont think either of them have much value

the term paparazzi comes from a private joke by 
film director federico fellini 
paparazzo was the name of an aggressive celebrity photographer 
in fellinis 1959 film la dolce vita but according to the 
random house dictionary of the english language the famed italian 
moviemaker found the italian name in the 1901 english novel by 
the ionian sea by george giffing which fellini read while 
making la dolce vita 
in the book mr paparazzo is an innkeeper there is no italian 
word paparazzo and the common plural for the photographers 
paparazzi was invented

the thin blue line the documentary movie 
about a texas murder that has audiences buzzing owes its origin to 
an unusual source public television 
the film playing in selected theaters across the country is 
among the latest fruits of an innovative financing deal created by 
the public broadcasting services american playhouse series 
the arrangement by which pbs helps pay production costs in 
exchange for first television rights has yielded some of the most 
critically acclaimed independent films in recent years including 
1983s testament 1984s el norte 1985s smooth talk 
last years stand and deliver and now the thin blue line 
i dont think any of those movies would have happened without 
american playhouse said lindsay law the series executive 
producer 
in an age of soaring production costs and diminishing 
underwriting the american playhouse formula stands as a 
costefficient programming breakthrough 
for the investment of about 500000 pbs not only obtains 
movies costing as much as 4 million but it also enjoys all of the 
publicity the movies generate in their theatrical runs the thin 
blue line is a case in point 
the cinematically inventive documentary directed by errol 
morris centers on a prisoners 12year effort to clear himself in 
the murder of a dallas police officer as morris tells the story 
there are a number of questions about the guilt of randall adams 
serving a life sentence for the 1976 murder of officer robert wood 
the possible culprit as the film implies is drifter david 
harris a career criminal who was the star prosecution witness 
against adams the movie has gathered glowing reviews fairly brisk 
boxoffice business and a petition drive aimed at clearing adams 
name 
the documentary will not appear on pbs for at least a year 
that too is part of the deal but if it continues to receive the 
acclaim it now attracts the thin blue line will arrive on 
public television with a builtin audience and be a hit 
the biggest problem that we have isnt that we dont have good 
programs said suzanne weil pbs senior vice president for 
programming we have terrific programs its that nobody ever 
knows about them every once in a while though we do one of 
the these movies and the word gets out so its a great way of 
getting some attention 
at the start public television stations were somewhat less 
impressed with the concept 
when we first released testament and el norte the 
stations were actually quite upset because both films were very 
wellreceived said law and the stations knew they had 
invested money in the movies and yet it was playing down the street 
from their station and they couldnt put it on the air 
and we kept saying listen this will pay off these two 
titles will be known to people when we put them on television 
and testament and el norte had twice american playhouses 
normal audience 
the financing idea was born in part out of the inability of 
american playhouse to attract the kind of talent its producers 
hoped it would lure a lot of very interesting writers and 
directors who we thought might come running did not law said 
what they dreamt of spending their time and talent on was 
feature films not television they very much grew up in that 
generation where the golden age of television was not part of their 
background the television that was part of their background was 
something not really worth the time or effort law said 
one upcoming project on the american playhouse movie 
schedule is bloodhounds of broadway starring madonna and matt 
dillon and costing around 4 million 
if i were making bloodhounds of broadway just for 
television theres no way i could have ever got it made law 
said but since it was going to be a feature film first i could 
go to feature film sources for financing who would not normally 
finance something for television 
and in the end the viewers of american playhouse enjoy the 
savings

across 20 feet of ankledeep water 
charlie land stares at a brown bear sow 
the bear stares back she scratches her side then lunges at 
land he fills the shrinking gap with a pink cloud of hotpepper 
aerosol a sort of natural tear gas and the bear wheels back to 
her side of the stream 
again she scratches finally she ambles off across the tidal 
flat 
land backsteps up the gravel spit he was defending then turns 
to the three people waiting a dozen steps behind him 
she didnt mean it he says she wasnt serious 
land shrugs off such confrontations as part of his job with the 
alaska department of fish and game enforcing an uneasy truce 
between man and bear at one of the few places where the species 
willingly meet 
pack creek flows into a narrow ocean inlet from a steep valley 
on admiralty island about 30 miles south of juneau the island 
boasts the greatest density in the world of alaska brown bears a 
larger version of the grizzly species 
late each summer about 30 bears congregate at pack creek 
splashing through the shallows after spawning salmon and grazing in 
the surrounding meadow like a herd of cows 
the interlopers game officials say are the increasing numbers 
of wildlife watchers whose eagerness to capture bears on film is 
crowding this corner of wilderness 
pack creek is one of only three observatories in alaska where 
people can readily watch brown bears the two others are so popular 
the state has a visitor limit at one and a lottery for permits to 
the other 
now pack creek is being overwhelmed 
up to 60 people a day hunker on the gravel spit yachts 
congregate offshore bush planes buzz in and out steadily in 1981 
100 people came to pack creek last year the visits topped 990 
until this year visitors and bears chased each other around the 
meadow at pack creek the people in pursuit of photographic 
trophies the bears guarding prime spots on the salmon stream 
but gradually the bears have grown bolder and less intimidated 
by humans they have chased people off the spit and carried away 
packs and food biologists learned from maulings at yellowstone and 
other parks which once had garbage dumps that bears become most 
dangerous when they associate people with food 
we think we have a bomb there and its ticking says ken 
mitchell us forest service director for the admiralty island 
nationl monument 
mitchell backs a plan designed by the forest service and state 
game officials to designate the spit as human turf and leave the 
rest of pack creek to the bears the authorities hope the boundary 
will keep people from being mauled and bears from being killed 
a few bearwatchers are furious 
the bears are all used to people and theyre busy fishing 
they dont mind you says john tillinghast a juneau attorney who 
visited the creek one recent weekend 
tillinghast said it used to be easy to come away from pack creek 
with a standard prize mom and cubs with a 50millimeter lens 
and you didnt have any babysitter from fish and game watching 
you either 
the bear that lunged at land called pest with reason 
prompted the new rule in 1987 a forest service letter file grew 
fat with reports of bold advances by bears along the creek mostly 
pest 
three wildlife watchers reported pest circled them chomping 
and growling then jumped toward them she was turned away by 
hotpepper spray 
a san francisco man told the forest service he was chased into 
the loft of a woodshed the only reason that i did not shoot was 
that there was a similar problem yesterday and the bear did not 
attack he wrote 
tourists abandoned a pizza on the spit while fleeing from an 
approaching bear a researcher recorded the bears reward down to 
the cheese hanging from its snout and paws 
forest service staffers at pack creek pleaded with mitchell to 
do something none of us wants to see pest killed but we feel 
some action must be taken soon to prevent more incidents they 
wrote suggesting the creek be closed to people 
in july 1987 the forest service and alaska fish and game 
announced pest would be killed when the anticipated roar of 
protest came they began work on the less drastic plan adopted this 
year 
enter stan price an irascible 88yearold who loathes 
government officials on principal and who has become a rallying 
point for others opposed to this particular government plan 
price built his cabin and floated it onto the remote banks of 
pack creek more than 30 years ago in the decades since he has 
shared the creek with dozens of bears and raised orphan cubs 
it burns me up price says of the new rules which he feels 
allow game officials to harass the animals i cant say what a 
bears worth i cant say what a bears good for but i know they 
were here before we were 
he reports little conflict with the bears that wander into his 
cabins and woodsheds price calls them tame and says he was injured 
by a bear only once when he mistook a strange animal for a 
familiar one and was swatted on the shoulder as he approached 
price believes the forest service and fish and game have trumped 
up tales of danger so people will believe they need official 
protection at pack creek then in the name of safety the agencies 
can charge admission and turn the creek into a moneymaking 
yellowstone he says 
price knows the bears by name and lineage and becomes distraught 
at thoughts they might be shot or relocated 
state and federal officials have said that if the boundary 
system doesnt work they will relocate pest and if she returns to 
pack creek and causes trouble shell be killed 
the forest service hopes to exercise some crowd control too by 
limiting commercial tours which now account for more than half the 
visitors officials are considering a fee to cover the government 
cost of monitoring pack creek estimated at more than 20000 a 
year they say theres no intent as price suggested of making a 
profit 
someday mitchell predicts therell be need for an observatory 
where hundreds of people can go to watch the bears annual fishing 
binge 
but it wont be at pack creek 
if there are such viewing areas mitchell says they 
probably shouldnt be in wilderness

restraint tempered desperate words at a strategy 
session of southern baptist moderates about where we go in a 
denomination now run by fundamentalists 
we are baptists in a denomination that has stopped being 
baptist said kirby godsey president of mercer university in 
macon ga 
the 900 moderate leaders of the coalition the southern baptist 
alliance made no move at their meeting in nashville tenn last 
weekend to quit the 147millionmember denomination although some 
speculated it eventually could happen 
for the time being however participants took lesser measures 
launching such independent projects as alternative sunday school 
lessons and theological education they keenly lamented the control 
achieved by fundamentalists over the denomination the countrys 
largest protestant body 
it is wounded and just may be mortally wounded said the 
rev randall lolley of raleigh nc 
the rev tom grace of st johns baptist church charlotte 
nc said we now exist in a state of grief grief over loss of 
our mother denomination 
its historic principles are in eclipse godsey said in 
the midst of these dreadful and frightening shadows of 
denominational eclipse we huddle together to find reassurance and 
light enough to sustain us 
the threeday meeting was called after fundamentalists last june 
won denominational rule for the 10th straight year 
they insist on a literal view of the bible as inerrant 
free of error historically scientifically and religiously 
moderates allow for diverse interpretations 
the fundamentalist wing gradually has gained sway over church 
institutions through the appointive powers of a succession of 
fundamentalist presidents the latest being the rev jerry vines of 
jacksonville fla 
sizing up the present status of moderates the rev cecil 
sherman of fort worth texas told the nashville meeting we have 
been put out of the house the game goes on but we dont get to 
play 
the alliance has 36460 members including individuals and 
member churches in 38 states 
its board voted to publish independent adult sunday school 
lessons beginning in january for those dissatisfied with materials 
put out by the denominational sunday school board 
the alliance also decided to support a house of baptist studies 
at duke university a methodist institution in durham nc and a 
divinity school at lake forest university in winston salem nc 
the moderates alloted 30000 to support various causes 
purportedly spurned by the fundamentalist administration such as 
peace making housing for the poor women in ministry and the 
doctrine of priesthood of the believer 
moderates criticized several recent denominational actions under 
fundamentalist control including 
the home mission boards prohibition of support to female 
pastors or divorced persons as missionaries 
the foreign mission boards dismissal of a missionary the 
rev michael willett accusing him of doctrinal ambiguity for 
not holding a literalistic view of some miracles 
a funding cut for the baptist joint committee on public 
affairs a religious liberty watchdog agency in washington 
involving eight baptist denominations 
tightened control over the southeastern baptist theological 
seminary in wake forest nc resulting in resignations of the 
president most top administrators and some faculty 
the alliances interim executive director the rev alan neely 
a professor at princeton university said the organization is not 
planning a new denomination but also is not ruling out that 
possibility 
the future is uncertain he said the alliance will remain 
active in its support for baptist principles and the baptist 
heritage of freedom until what we perceive as designed 
concentrated calculated oppression is relieved 
we are simply trying to provide an arena for people who have 
been selected out prevented prohibited blackballed by those in 
power to have a place to stand and can have some free air to 
breathe 
a straw poll at the meeting found 90 percent of the participants 
favored some change in relation to the denominations cooperative 
program through which various agencies are financed 
several particpants favored continued support for that unified 
budget but also creation of foundations to finance causes not 
backed by the denomination but deemed important to moderates 
others favored designated giving only to chosen 
denominational programs with moderates putting other funds in 
escrow until fundamentalists agree to political changes in bylaws 
that enable factional control 
the proposals were to be considered at an alliance board meeting 
scheduled for nov 2829 in charlotte nc

a lutheran pastor has asked his congregation 
for permission to perform homosexual wedding ceremonies but his 
bishop says congregations do not have the authority to sanction 
such unions 
the rev james bartos pastor of the village church says a 
decision will be made after a church forum on the issue sept 18 
when the congregation will discuss biblical and ethical concerns 
relating to homosexual relationships 
bishop peter rogness of the southeastern wisconsin synod of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america said he applauded bartos 
effort to examine a contemporary question but a congregation 
would not be sanctioned to perform homosexual marriages

conventions and not bishops set policy and conventions have not

decatur ga about twothirds of the most militant

but about onethird of the more than 800 respondents to the sbc

support of southern baptists 
editor jack harwell said he was surprised the number favoring 
the status quo was so high because these readers of sbc today are 
considered the most militant moderates if weve got a radical 
group on the left it would be our readers 
the denomination has been split by a decadelong battle between

a new generation of skyscrapers is about to alter 
the skyline of atlanta previously dismissed as sterile and 
nondescript 
even homegrown architect john portman whose glass towers and 
soaring atriums for years defined atlanta and who in the past 
criticized postmodern architecture as a step backward has given a 
nod to the style in his latest project a 60story office building 
planned for downtown atlanta 
much of the excitement over the pending transformation of the 
capital of the new south started last fall with the opening of the 
50story ibm building officially called one atlantic center it is 
a slender postmodern tower of stone with tall arched entryways 
and gothic finials dramatically crowned by a 100foothigh 
eightsided copper pyramid topped by a golden lantern 
rushhour traffic on interstate 85 slows to a cautious crawl as 
drivers gaze its way at night the lights in its crown command 
attention from all over town architecture writers have used words 
like gracious truly wonderful serene imposing 
and glamorous to describe the tower 
it certainly projects a vibrance to the rest of the world 
said roy cooper vice president for economic development with the 
atlanta chamber of commerce its just beautiful everybodys 
just staggered by it 
the tower is a dramatic departure from the glass boxes common in 
modern architecture and contrasts with the sleek look of most of 
the citys tallest buildings 
its influence shows up in at least three other skyscrapers going 
up in atlanta and the design of the proposed promenade skyscraper 
complex was altered to complement the rosecolored ibm tower 
new york architect john burgee whose firm designed the ibm 
building with design consultant philip johnson wont take credit 
for transforming atlantas skyline but he said the citys image 
as defined by the way it looks is undergoing a change 
atlanta has been looking for its identity burgee said in a 
telephone interview from his new york office its an historical 
city but its architecture and image is not strictly historical 
you think of atlanta and you think of gone with the wind now 
there is an attempt to come up with a visual image 
we all know peachtree street but you dont think of its 
buildings he said like in new york the empire state 
building chicago the sears building san francisco the 
transamerica building atlanta doesnt have that its moving 
toward that very definitely 
burgee and johnson also are behind one ninety one peachtree 
tower a postmodern skyscraper planned for downtown atlanta 
another planned project grouped in the son of ibm building 
spurt is the promenade in the treelined historic midtown section 
a complex of three office buildings and a hotel being developed by 
atampt and the atlantabased landmarks group 
when unveiled last year it was designed with an exterior of 
glittering green glass but when promenade officials saw the 
excitement over the nearby ibm tower its architects thompson 
ventulett amp stainback redrew the plans to use rose glass above 
rosetoned stone and topped with a gray steel spire 
the most recently announced skyscraper is a downtown giant by 
portman whose imprint is already deeply felt in atlanta primarily 
through the peachtree center and the towering cylindrical westin 
peachtree plaza hotel 
portmans new building is slated to begin construction next year 
and at 60 stories will eclipse one atlantic as the southeasts 
tallest building unveiling the design in may portman said it was 
respectful of the past but like this city is audacious and bold 
and forwardlooking the beginning of postpostmodern 
architecture 
dale durfee a professor of architecture at georgia tech said 
completion of the ibm tower signaled the acceleration of a change 
in the look of the city that began a decade ago 
atlanta was pretty much plain vanilla he said with no 
development of architectural significance 
burgee echoed that appraisal saying it was pretty 
nondescript it might be anyplace if they took you to atlanta 
blindfolded and took off the blindfold you wouldnt have a clue 
where you are 
durfee said that 10 years ago atlanta was groping to form an 
identity and had no demand for the type of buildings now are going 
up 
today however companies want sophistication in their office 
buildings durfee said and corporate sponsorship of building 
projects has changed the rules of skyscraper financing 
some say that all the building activity simply makes good 
business sense 
sure theres competitive prestige good architecture is good 
business said truman hartshorn chairman of the geography 
department at georgia state university and a specialist in urban 
affairs 
a goodlooking building he said is easier to sell to the 
financing people as well as the tenants 
hartshorn said he expects the new projects in atlanta will bring 
special recognition 
i think its going to open some eyes he said we have 
prestige with our cultural buildings but i dont know that our 
office buildings are that distinctive nationally 
these arent just ultra postmodern theyre classic theyre 
different

nightclubs and nudity are banned on this 
island where tradition holds that st john wrote the new 
testaments book of revelation in a cave overlooking the aegean sea 
under a special government decree patmos has a unique status 
among greeces 200 or so inhabited islands as a holy island 
still dominated by its 900yearold byzantine monastery 
we prefer our visitors to be pilgrims rather than ordinary 
tourists and we would like them to respect our tradition abbot 
isidoros who heads the 30member community at the monastery of st 
john the theologian said in an interview 
but plans for an airport coupled with widespread publicity for 
the monasterys 900th anniversary celebrations are expected to 
bring mass tourism to patmos in the coming years 
the tranquillity of patmos a rocky outcrop in the dodecanese 
group of islands with around 2000 residents attracts wealthy 
greeks and foreigners who have restored scores of traditional 
mansions clustered beneath the monasterys gray fortresslike walls 
many have given donations to the monastery to help maintain its 
library of rare manuscripts and early books along with a 
collection of priceless icons portraits of saints painted in gold 
and bright colors 
patmos is still a place apart with a unique atmosphere 
unlike other islands a conscious effort has been made to protect 
it said maria king constantinides a boston antiques dealer with 
a family home there 
signs in greek french german or english scattered around the 
islands beaches point out that nudity is not allowed one disco 
operates on a remote bay but the narrow alleys around the 
monastery fall silent by 10 pm even in summer 
people sometimes go topless on the beaches but on the 
whole the rules are respected said christos kyrozis the 
islands doctor and also its mayor 
the development project planned by greeces state tourist 
organization eot together with the monastery and town authorities 
calls for construction of an airport zoning for new hotels and 
bungalows and improved harbor facilities 
past experience shows that once an island gets an airport 
mass tourism is very difficult to avoid said eleni bonou who 
heads the project but an airport is essential because it serves 
the islanders first 
more than 30000 visitors come to patmos every year but 
twothirds of them arrive aboard cruise ships that steam away 
before sunset after a few hours stay 
on an island too barren to grow its own food visitors are the 
only source of income apart from fishing 
theres a delicate balance to be kept between god and mammon 
on this island mayor kyrozis said there has to be tourism 
but not so much it kills what we have to offer 
trained for a more secluded life the monks say its already 
hard work taking turns to supervise the tourists swarming through 
the monastery museum its frescoed chapels and stone colonnades 
the sheer numbers of people coming through mean that were 
exhausted by the time the seasons over and theres time to get on 
with our own tasks said brother chrysostomos the monastery 
librarian 
the tourists also crowd into the monastery of the apocalypse 
built over the cave where st john supposedly wrote his visionary 
work while exiled on patmos around ad 95 
its historical fact that st john was on the island said 
athanassios kominis an athens university professor of byzantine 
studies the tradition that he wrote revelation there is 
certainly more than speculation but not quite certainty 
patriarch dimitrios spiritual leader of eastern orthodox 
christians worldwide plans to lead orthodox roman catholic and 
protestant churchmen in a twoday international pilgrimage to 
patmos sept 2526 
it celebrates the 900th birthday of the monastery of st john 
founded in 1088 by a byzantine scholar the blessed christodoulos 
with special permission from the emperor alexius comnenos

a few years back the prospect of 14 a barrel oil 
sent shivers down many a texas spine but state economists and oil 
analysts are shrugging off the possible effects of the recent slide 
in oil prices to near twoyear lows 
optimists might attribute the change in attitude to a 
diversification of the states economy since the great oil bust of 
1986 
but analysts say the main reason for the change is that oil 
companies have grown so lean since then that prices would have to 
drop considerably further to wreak more shortterm havoc with the 
industry and the states economy 
oil futures slipped below 14 per barrel this week before 
surging back a bit after king fahd of saudi arabia called for 
better cooperation among opec members 
the october contract for delivery of west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude rose 7 cents to settle at 1456 
a barrel on tuesday 
the october contract had skidded as low as 1375 during 
mondays trading marking the lowest level since oct 29 1986 
before rebounding on spot markets crude prices also are below 
1450 
despite the dwindling upstream profits from drilling and 
production texas refineries are profitably working around the 
clock and the integrated oil companies have streamlined enough to 
make up for the low price of crude with the relatively firm price 
of refined products 
the energy industry is just as important as it once was but 
if you look at the region and the composition of industry its a 
much smaller share said michelle michot foss senior associate 
at houstons rice center not that the others have grown so much 
but because the oil industry has gotten smaller 
the texas economy has grown less dependent on oil tax revenue 
the state had a 113 million budget surplus in the 1988 fiscal year 
despite continuing problems in the oilpatch 
in fiscal 1987 the state legislature had to raise taxes to 
cover a 57 billion deficit and meet a constitutional requirement 
for a balanced budget 
texas employment commission figures indicate the estimated 
statewide civilian workforce in oil and gas extraction declined by 
57700 jobs between december 1985 and december 1986 to 184500 
from 242200 
the houston area lost about 160000 jobs of all types during the 
first major drop in oil prices in 198283 and an additional 
130000 jobs disappeared in the 1986 price plunge officials said 
our shortterm dependency on oil during this recovery oddly 
enough is not that great but the states longterm dependency is 
significant said ray perryman director of the baylor university 
forecasting service 
texas gradual economic recovery he said has been driven 
primarily by export industries including petrochemicals paper 
aircraft and electronics 
i think that a year from today if the price of oil stays at 
that level the economic outlook in texas will be lower than 
otherwise perryman said but i dont think were going to have 
any significant problems unless the price drops below the texas 
production levels of 1150 a barrel and stays there 
tony proffitt a spokesman for state comptroller bob bullock 
also said a sustained depression in oil prices would hurt the state 
economy but the industrys importance had declined in recent 
years he noted that oil and gas revenue accounted for only 9 
percent of state economic activity compared with as much as 27 
percent at one time 
the comptrollers office reported 4905 million in oil tax 
revenue during the 1988 fiscal year and projected 5317 million in 
1989 revenue the estimated figure may have to be lowered if prices 
continue dropping proffitt said 
many analysts predict continuing softness in the market 
although there is widespread belief that current low levels are 
temporary 
however there is fear that even shortterm dips could have a 
chilling effect on the industry and score a psychological blow to 
the optimism needed in a recovering economy 
ive already seen some indications of companies making 
decisions that are a little more conservative than they would have 
been otherwise said ken miller senior consultant at the 
consulting firm purvin amp gertz inc 
this price drop is certainly nowhere near the same magnitude 
as what happened in 1986 but i think its reminding people of 
that said miller who is predicting moderate price increases in 
late 1988 some people were starting to get a little complacent 
with the price up a little bit and this is a reminder that that 
low price atmosphere is certainly still with us

boxing champ mike tysons image has taken some 
lumps outside the ring in the past few weeks and some advertising 
consultants say it may cost him lucrative commercial work 
nobody wants to lose the customers they already have and all 
the negative stuff with him is a way to lose customers said 
lloyd kolmer who heads a firm that advises advertisers on signing 
celebrities for commercials 
since dispatching michael spinks in a 91second bout for the 
heavyweight chasmpionship in june tyson has gone through a 
rancorous court battle with his manager engaged in a street fight 
with a former opponent and survived a car crash that one newspaper 
reported and tyson denied was an attempted suicide 
those incidents offer a contrast to the cheery and confident guy 
who appeared in three diet pepsi commercials this past summer in 
which the soda maker touted tyson and diet pepsi as undisputed 
champs in one of the ads the champ took a soft drink from the 
refrigerator while his wife actress robin givens playfully 
snapped a towel at him 
the ads were so popular that pepsicola co ran them for two 
months instead of the one month originally planned pepsi spokesman 
tod mackenzie said tuesday 
mackenzie said the tyson ads were last run in late august the 
company now is using ads featuring americas cup yachtsman dennis 
conner 
he said recent publicity about tyson had no bearing on the 
decision to quit using the tyson diet pepsi ads they had run 
their course mackenzie said 
he said there never had been any talk of a longerterm relation 
with tyson who reportedly was paid 125 million for his work 
but kolmer who was not involved in negotiating tysons 
appearance in the ads speculated that pepsi had an option to 
continue to use tyson in its ads but chose not to do so 
in effect he has been fired they can phrase it any way they 
want to he said 
bill cayton tysons manager said the reports about tyson had 
hurt the boxers image but insisted that tyson had been a victim 
of circumstance who would be able over time to improve his image 
cayton said that meanwhile he had put on hold his talks 
with a battery maker and an electronics company about having tyson 
appear in commercials for them he refused to identify the 
companies 
im not pushing at this time cayton said its not the 
best negotiating atmosphere i want this unfair wave to subside 
before i proceed 
cayton said tyson is the best fighter in the world today and 
said he was confident tyson will go on to bigger and better 
things in every area 
tyson signed oneyear contracts within the past few months to 
appear in ads in japan for suntory beer and toyota vehicles cayton 
said 
in addition nintendo of america inc a redmont washbased 
video games maker signed tyson 13 months ago to a twoyear 
contract to appear in ads for mike tysons punchout which has 
proven one of its bestselling products 
richard lindner a nintendo spokesman said there had been no 
discussion of cancelling the agreement he said the tyson game was 
not currently being advertised however because the company 
normally pitches only its new releases with advertising 
nova lanktree director of burns sports celebrity service in 
chicago said she views tyson as a celebrity who has transcended 
his sport and expects he will weather the recent controversy 
his career is by no means over as an endorsement candidate 
she said 
but marty blackman who advises advertisers on use of sports 
celebrities said the advertising industry by nature is a 
conservative industry 
certain behavior may be more acceptable in new york than it is 
in the heartland he said we are advising clients to proceed 
with caution

a professor at rutgers university has 
developed what the school says is a faster way of measuring food 
deterioration which could reduce the need for preservatives and 
help cut food manufacturing costs 
the method combines previously known scientific tools with 
computer technology and lets researchers measure food shelf life 
within hours compared with the weeks or years it used to take 
school officials said tuesday 
rutgers has applied for a patent for the process which can be 
applied to dried goods such as cookies fruit breakfast cereal 
instant coffee and milk powder said myron solberg director of 
rutgers center for advanced food technology 
the roots of the process date to more than 10 years ago when 
seymour gilbert an internationally known foodpackaging expert and 
longtime rutgers professor found a way of measuring how food 
absorbs potential carcinogens from packaging his findings were 
applied worldwide 
he began using the same technology five years ago to find out 
how food breaks down and since then has been working on the 
problem with a team of almost 20 graduate students 
the key to determining shelf life is discovering how the water 
interacts with food he said 
gilbert 74 illustrates his case with the bagel which turns 
hard after a few days but regains its softness when toasted the 
starch and proteins push out the water and crystalize hardening 
the food but heating the bagel reverses the process he said 
this is part of the research ive been doing to see how the 
water redistributed itself he said 
the technique known as inverse gas chromatography 
essentially measures a products potential for absorbing and losing 
water 
samples are put in a chromatography column a sensitive 
instrument that measures how the water interacts with the food and 
a computer is used to quickly analyze the resulting data 
its a kind of tool for the development of new products and 
also to do quality control on existing products solberg said 
by knowing how long food will last manufacturers can offer 
consumers fresher products and reduce costs and waste they also 
may be able to reduce the use of preservatives rutgers researchers 
say 
it wont eliminate the need for preservatives but it will give 
a better feel for when a preservative is needed solberg said 
the accuracy of current methods of determining shelf life 
varies scientists say methods range from putting items on a shelf 
and waiting several years to see how long they last to accelerating 
the aging process by raising the temperature 
my method works in standard temperatures but i use very small 
amounts of material and an apparatus thats very sensitive so i can 
measure very small rates of change gilbert said 
in the united states alone millions of dollars worth of food 
are lost to spoilage each year said robert buchanan at the us 
department of agricultures research center in philadelphia 
other scientists declined to comment on gilberts technique on 
the grounds that they did not have enough information 
ive never heard of anything like this before said kevin 
hicks another usda research leader in philadelphia it sounds 
very original it also sounds very difficult but perhaps 
promising 
fergus m clydesdale head of the department of food science and 
nutrition at the university of massachusetts at amherst said i 
think its an interesting application of the technology but it 
isnt going to change the color of the sky

kroger co the nations largest grocery 
chain has proposed a 38 billion restructuring plan to shield 
itself against any hostile takeover bids 
the cincinnatibased company said tuesday it was considering a 
plan that would make kroger an unattractive takeover target by 
raising its stock price loading it up with new debt placing 20 
percent of its shares under control of its employees and selling 
off parts of the company 
the proposal followed news that the haft family of maryland 
received federal antitrust clearance to acquire kroger stock and 
pushed kroger shares sharply higher 
kroger stock soared by 1175 a share to 5125 in heavy trading 
tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
under the restructuring shareholders would get a onetime cash 
dividend of 40 per share and would receive longterm bonds worth 
another 8 a share while retaining their kroger common stock 
based on its 7857 million common shares outstanding it would 
cost about 315 billion to pay the dividends kroger also would 
have to borrow another 630 million to cover the bonds 
by continuing as an independent company the interests of our 
employees customers and the communities in which we operate would 
also be protected said kroger chairman lyle everingham 
krogers directors will meet in the very near future to vote 
on the plan company representative paul bernish said 
directors met in emergency session friday to prepare the 
protection plan only hours after the federal trade commission told 
the hafts they could buy kroger stock without violating antitrust 
laws 
the hafts have launched a number of major raids against grocery 
companies and other retailers including unsuccessful but 
profitable hostile bids for safeway supermarkets general and stop 
n shop it was not known how much kroger stock the hafts own 
although they must disclose when they acquire 5 percent or more of 
the companys outstanding shares 
the ftc clearance was the first official sign of the hafts 
interest in kroger although kroger stock has has traded heavily 
over the past five months amid rumors the hafts and other potential 
acquirers were interested in the company representatives of the 
hafts declined to comment 
kroger reported sales of almost 18 billion in 1987 it operates 
1317 supermarkets nationwide as well as 900 convenience stores 
and employs 170000 people 
kroger said it will repay the debt incurred in the restructuring 
using cash flow from operations reducing expenses and selling 
assets in a 1986 restructuring kroger sold its chain of superx 
retail drugstores and kroger has worked since july to sell off its 
unprofitable chain of florida choice supermarkets and liquor stores 
in florida 
analysts said the proposed restructuring if undertaken 
probably would be enough to scare off any wouldbe hostile buyers 
the dividend portion of the plan alone would cost 377 million a 
year in interest assuming a rate of 12 percent estimated william 
flyg vice president of big bear inc the columbus ohiobased 
grocery chain that competes with kroger in columbus that would 
exceed krogers 1987 pretax income of 3156 million 
kroger could raise between 800 million and 900 million from 
asset sales said gary m giblen vice president of the investment 
firm of rotanmosle inc

legislation to impose tougher economic 
sanctions on whitedominated south africa is under examination by a 
sharply divided senate panel with opponents saying the bill would 
limit the options of the next us president 
although the senate foreign relations committee was expected to 
approve the sanctions bill on a narrow partyline vote today 
supporters conceded they had neither the votes to shut off debate 
on the senate floor nor to override a nearcertain veto by 
president reagan should the bill pass 
the bill intended as a followup to a set of milder sanctions 
enacted over a reagan veto in 1986 would require an end to most 
trade with south africa and the withdrawal of most us business 
investment from the racially divided nation 
the house approved similar legislation on aug 11 
republican opponents of the measure passed up an opportunity 
last week to vote on amendments as some gop senators said changes 
might make the bill more acceptable and therefore harder to oppose 
the 1986 sanctions bill was supported by a broad coalition of 
senators from both parties 
but only a few republicans have indicated they are ready to 
support a stronger set of sanctions with some contending that a 
trade embargo and disinvestment would end any leverage the united 
states may have to encourage pretoria to end the countrys system 
of forced racial separation and control known as apartheid 
they also said that adopting the sanctions bill now would 
foreclose the options of the next president whether he be 
republican george bush who opposes sanctions or democrat michael 
dukakis who favors them 
the state department also opposes the legislation contending 
its passage might disrupt usmediated talks among south africa 
angola and cuba aimed at south african withdrawal from the 
territory of south west africa or namibia and the withdrawal of 
cuban troops from angola 
democrats said the bill represents the only remaining means of 
sending a strong signal to south africa that the united states is 
willing to pay a price to end the apartheid system 
they said the issue is a moral one not political and that 
sanctions represent the only available way to forestall a violent 
revolution inside south africa by moving that country toward 
multiracial democratic rule

ronald o perelman has sold his 15 percent stake 
in tw services inc for about 137 million the latest in a string 
of asset sales by the billionaire takeover strategist 
perelman who is chairman of revlon inc sold 723 million 
shares of tw services a major food services company for 19 
apiece on tuesday according to revlon vice chairman donald drapkin 
last friday perelmans macandrews amp forbes group inc agreed to 
sell its technicolor holdings inc film processing business to 
britains carlton communications plc for 780 million 
in addition perelman reportedly has agreed to sell his 
consolidated cigar corp to a leveraged buyout group for 125 
million 
the moves which reportedly have raised perelmans takeover 
warchest to about 2 billion have fueled speculation that the 
accomplished takeover strategist was looking for major targets 
perelman who acquired technicolor in 1982 won a bitter 
takeover fight for revlon in 1985 and has made several 
unsuccessful overtures to gillette co since late 1986 
he has developed a reputation as a builder rather than a 
speculative corporate raider boosting profits at revlon and 
technicolor during his stewardship of those companies 
the sale of a 15 percent chunk of tw services also has raised 
speculation that the food services company might be a takeover 
target stock in tw which operates the dennys and hardees fast 
food chains among others rose 162 to 2062 a share in heavy 
new york stock exchange trading tuesday 
drapkin said perelman was supportive of tw management and had 
not sold his tw shares to the company

the government today reported the lowest monthly trade deficit 
in nearly four years inciting a hectic rally in the dollar easing 
interest rates in the credit markets and boosting the republican 
presidential campaign 
the commerce department said the merchandise trade deficit 
shrank to 95 billion in july the lowest monthly imbalance since 
december 1984 and substantially better than many economists had 
predicted 
the 28 percent improvement reflected a small increase in exports 
and a big decline in imports 
it was certain to cheer republican presidential candidate george 
bush who has been trying to deflect charges from democrat michael 
dukakis that the nations soaring deficits reflect major flaws in 
the reagan economic program 
but the commerce department also revised upward its june deficit 
figure to 132 billion from 125 billion which would be the 
biggest gap since the february shortfall of 144 billion 
money traders scrambled to buy dollars after todays report was 
released sending the currency sharply higher in value against the 
west german mark and japanese yen 
in the bond market a sensitive indicator of inflation and the 
economys direction the key 30year treasury bond rose more than 
750 per 1000 in face amount and its yield fell to 898 percent 
from 899 percent late tuesday 
bond traders were primarily reacting to the big shrinkage in 
imports which suggested the economy may be slowing down and 
thereby easing fears of inflation 
the trade report was issued prior to the opening bell on wall 
street but stock traders already had assumed there would be good 
news today and drove prices up late tuesday encouraged by remarks 
from treasury secretary designate nicholas f brady 
brady told a senate confirmation hearing that he expects the 
trade deficit to decline at a surprisingly fast pace over the 
next few years 
in addition the commerce department said tuesday that the 
deficit in the current account the broadest measure of us trade 
shrank to 333 billion in the second quarter a 98 percent 
improvement from a first quarter imbalance of 369 billion 
it was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 201 percent 
drop in the final three months of last year the current account 
covers trade in merchandise as well as trade in services which 
primarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries 
in other markets tuesday oil prices advanced driven by a rise 
in wholesale gasoline prices which soared on news that refineries 
and oil platforms were threatened by a hurricane approaching the 
gulf of mexico 
the contract for october delivery of west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude rose 7 cents to settle at 1456 
a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery closed up 119 
cents at 4381 cents a gallon 
elsewhere the government released a statebystate report on 
unemployment in which vermont emerged as the best job provider for 
its residents massachusetts slipped from first place to 10th in 
the past year among states with the lowest unemployment rates 
vermont posted an unemployment rate of 23 percent in july with 
just 6900 of its workers lacking jobs the bureau of labor 
statistics said 
massachusetts unemployment rate meanwhile rose to 36 percent 
in july a full percentage point higher than the same month a year

oil futures prices surged in early trading today 
on a string of bullish factors including news that a hurricane 
threatens us crude production along the gulf of mexico coast 
on the new york mercantile exchange the october contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude was 
quoted 57 cents higher at 1512 a 42gallon barrel shortly after 
the market opened from tuesdays settlement price of 1456 
contracts had traded between 1433 a barrel and 1470 a barrel 
tuesday after mondays whiplash session in which prices dropped to 
a near twoyear low of 1375 before rebounding to settle at 1449 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery zoomed 194 
cents a gallon in early trading to 4580 cents from tuesdays close 
of 4381 cents a gallon 
the october wholesale heating oil contract also was up sharply 
trading about 122 cents a gallon higher than its close of 4183 
cents a gallon on tuesday 
this could be one of the wildest trading days with all the 
news said peter beutel assistant director of elders futures 
inc in new york 
analysts said todays market was continuing the bullish 
sentiment started tuesday on concerns that refineries and oil 
platforms were being evacuated in anticipation of the approaching 
storm 
if the hurricane hits the gulf coast theres concern about 
shortterm gasoline supplies said chris mccormack an energy 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
analysts said that although hurricane gilbert had not damaged 
the gulf oil fields between 600000 and 800000 gallons a day of 
gasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out the 
storm 
meanwhile this mornings market also reacted strongly to an 
announcement by opec secretary general subroto that the cartels 
pricing committee had set a meeting date of sept 2526 
the announcement generates hope that the 13member organization 
of petroleum exporting countries will call for a full meeting of 
the cartel to set production limits and curb the ouput that has 
flooded world oil markets and eroded prices analysts said 
meanwhile oil brokers were saying this week that the recent dip 
in oil prices had not affected retail prices yet but by winter 
consumers could realize some benefits at the pump 
if we see another 2 slide in oil prices then consumer 
gasoline prices could be expected to go 7 to 8 cents lower when 
its all over by thanksgiving said stephen smith an analyst 
with bear stearns amp co 
other oil brokers said that if crude prices remained between the 
1350 and 1550 levels in the next several weeks retail gasoline 
prices could decline by about 2 cents a gallon

somebody at the internal revenue service 
forgot to look at the calendar and the goof could cost the 
government as much as 100 million in taxes 
the irs confirmed today that it was one day late in filing a 
notice of appeal in an important case an appeal that some legal 
experts expect the irs would have won an agency spokesman disputed 
the estimate of what the error could cost 
on may 26 the us tax court entered a decision holding that 
the irs was wrong in requiring atampt to pay tax currently on 
customer security deposits under the law the agency had 90 days 
to appeal a period that ended aug 24 the notice of appeal was 
filed aug 25 
underscoring this embarrassment is the fact that the service 
prevailed in the only appellate decision addressing the issue 
presented in the atampt case reported tax notes an authoritative 
tax journal the publication noted a previous appeals court verdict 
in favor of the irs in a florida case involving security deposits 
paid by gas customers 
a similar case involving deposits paid to indianapolis power amp 
light co has been appealed by the irs to the 7th circuit court of 
appeals despite the error in the atampt case irs spokesman frank 
keith said today irs has no intention of abandoning its position 
on customer deposits 
tax notes estimated the goof could cost 100 million in disputed 
taxes and interest keith contended however that because the 
issue is essentially one of when taxes should be paid the 
potential loss would be less

drexel burnham lambert inc and its star 
highyield bond trader michael milken have issued wideranging 
subpoenas for evidence to defend themselves against the securities 
and exchange commissions massive fraud case 
notice of some of the subpoenas filed tuesday in manhattan 
federal court reflected the investment firms intention to 
undertake an aggressive defense against the sec civil charges 
announced last week after a nearly twoyear probe stemming from the 
ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
unlike restrictive pretrial factfinding rules for defendants in 
criminal cases defendants in civil suits enjoy broad subpoena 
rights to seek testimony and other evidence used in the accusations 
against them 
drexel milken and three other employees of the firm were 
accused by the sec of scheming with boesky to profit on insider 
trading manipulate stock cheat clients keep phony books and 
other fraudulent acts the sec suit also named miami financier 
victor posner his son steven and a posnercontrolled company 
pennsylvania engineering corp 
those subpoenaed by the defense dont yet include boesky the 
onetime wall street speculator and imprisoned insider trader who 
negotiated a pleabargain cooperation agreement with the government 
and implicated drexel and the others 
it was unclear why the drexel team of defense lawyers have not 
yet sought testimony from boesky martin flumenbaum a milken 
attorney identified as the lead lawyer in the subpoena notice did 
not return telephone calls for comment 
regardless of whether boeskys testimony is sought lawyers 
familiar with the case have predicted the manhattan us attorneys 
office which has been conducting a criminal probe of drexel and 
milken would likely move to nullify any boesky subpoena on grounds 
it could compromise the investigation 
according to the defense notice filed in court those subpoenaed 
include investment businesses once linked to boesky several 
manhattan art galleries once patronized by boesky as well as the 
washington law firm of fried frank jacobson harris amp shriver 
which helped negotiate his plea agreement 
defense lawyers also are seeking any audio or video tape 
recordings held by the government in connection with the drexel 
case 
there has been speculation that boesky secretly taped 
discussions with milken while cooperating with the government in 
1986 before the announcement that he would settle sec insider 
trading charges by paying 100 million in illicit profits and 
fines as well as plead guilty to a criminal charge 
the court notice didnt identify other recipients of subpoenas 
but the wall street journal quoted unidentified people it said were 
familiar with the case as saying they included numerous potential 
witnesses including former employees of boeskycontrolled 
organizations

the public wants larger more powerful cars 
and tighter fuel economy standards would result in lost jobs 
general motors corp said today in a federal hearing on the 
gasoline mileage rules 
this regulation flies against the basic forces of economics 
said richard klimisch gms environmental activities executive 
director the consumer is reacting to gasoline prices which are 
lower than anyone expected so the consumer does not rank fuel 
economy as a top priority 
environmentalists also testifying at the hearing said in a 
news conference tuesday that looser fueleconomy standards would 
contribute to environmental damage including a warming of the 
global climate 
the hearing by the national highway traffic safety 
administration was taking public comment on a proposal to set the 
corporate average fuel economy or cafe standard at 265 miles per 
gallon to 275 mpg 
without the new rule the standard would revert to the 275 mpg 
voted by congress in 1975 it has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 
under an exception allowed by nhtsa 
the fueleconomy law adopted to reduce imported petroleum 
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices sets a maximum 
level of fuel consumption each automakers fleet of passenger cars 
on average must meet 
gms customers choose cars in part based on gasoline prices and 
with the price at the pump running below 1 per gallon in much of 
the nation car buyers see little value in features that save fuel 
klimisch said 
should the standard be placed at 275 mpg gm would be forced to 
cut back on largecar production at its arlington texas plant at 
a cost of 60000 jobs to gm and its suppliers in 1989 and 110000 
jobs in 1990 klimisch said 
car buyers faced with a shortage of higherpowered gm cars 
would buy from foreign automakers buy light trucks that come under 
different standards or drive older less fuelefficient cars 
longer klimisch said 
eventually gm might be forced to increase the percentage of 
foreignmade parts in its cars to meet the demands of the 
marketplace he said 
the automaker estimates it might be able to meet a standard of 
about 271 mpg without job losses but to make sure of that in 
light of the uncertainties of sales forecasts and test results it 
needs a standard of 267 mpg or less he said 
a coalition of 20 environmental groups called for stiffening of 
the standards to avoid contributing to global warming 
if you liked this summers heat and droughts youll love the 
results of this policy said thomas b stoel jr international 
program director of the natural resources defense council in 
view of what the scientists are telling us about global warming it 
is hard to imagine a more irresponsible proposal 
researchers have predicted that manmade emissions of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere will raise the average global temperature 
significantly during the next century causing changes in weather 
patterns crop growth and increased sea levels from polar melting 
carbon dioxide tends to trap heat in the atmosphere rather than 
allowing it to radiate back into space a phenomenon called the 
greenhouse effect 
automobiles account for about 25 percent of us emissions of 
carbon dioxide stoel said 
if the us auto fleet could be brought up to an average of 45 
mpg by the year 2005 this one action would reduce us carbon 
dioxide emissions by about 15 percent he said 
loosening the standard from 275 mpg to 26 mpg would increase 
carbon dioxide emissions over the estimated 106000mile life of 
each affected car by about 16 tons or 4 percent according to 
figures presented by energy conservation coalition

the coppermining town of cananea has 
come to symbolize the birth of mexicos nationalist spirit in the 
82 years since a bloody strike pitted mexican workers against an 
american mine owner 
today a new generation of cananea miners says a government plan 
to return the nationalized but debtridden copper company to the 
private sector is like selling a historical landmark 
this is a national patrimony we feel it in our souls said 
joaquin quijano salazar general secretary of national miners union 
section 65 representing 3000 workers at cananea 25 miles south 
of the arizona border in sonora state 
under a plan to reduce government subsidies and help mexico 
overcome its severe economic crisis the administration of 
president miguel de la madrid has sold many nonessential 
stateowned companies most of them money losers 
the sale of the cananea mine would be by far the biggest 
transfer undertaken but it now appears a final decision will be up 
to carlos salinas de gortari due to take office as president in 
december 
since the failure of a 910 million bid by protexa based in 
this northern industrial city the development bank handling the 
sale said the government has received no new offers 
in a written response to a list of questions directed to its 
mexico city headquarters the national financiera bank said cananea 
now could be sold as a package deal along with another sonora 
copper mining operation mexicana del cobre 
unofficial reports say the government will ask for 2 billion 
for the two mines but quijano said that the union opposes the sale 
they can sell a company but they cant sell workers he 
said adding that some potential buyers want to purchase the mine 
without the union contract 
the cananea consolidated copper co was founded by american 
entrepeneur william c greene in 1899 
according to the labor struggle in cananea 1906 published 
by the sonora state government greene ran the mine as an american 
fiefdom 
the mexican workers at cananea were discontented because of 
the inequalities that existed between them and the foreign workers 
at the same company they also found themselves restricted 
almost without exception to the most arduous and worst paid 
jobs the book said 
on june 1 1906 2000 mexican miners rallying under the slogan 
five pesos then 10 for eight hours work went on strike 
on june 2 according to the book north americans barricaded 
in the main offices fired indiscriminately at the mexicans 
mexican police and soldiers aided by arizona rangers put down 
the rebellion june 5 and jailed its surviving leaders 
jose luis trueva a writer who is compiling a history of the 
cananea labor movement said estimates of the death toll range from 
11 to more than 100 including americans 
the mexican dead are remembered throughout mexico each labor day 
with shouts of we will not forget the martyrs of cananea 
although at least 25 labor strikes broke out between 1905 and 
1908 the cananea strike often is credited with sparking the 
mexican labor movement and with helping to launch the mexican 
revolution of 1910 
in cananea a town of 25000 people today a local junior high 
school is named the martyrs of 1906 and two monuments stand in 
memory of those who died 
the mexican government which has controlled the operations 
since the 1970s launched a multimilliondollar expansion project 
before the onset of the economic crisis in 1982 said company 
spokesman roberto rojas 
those expenditures steady devaluations in the peso and the low 
price of copper on the international market helped put cananeas 
total debt at the equivalent of 1 billion today according to 
company figures published in the august national business magazine 
expansion 
but now the improvements are complete the price of copper is 
back up over 1 a pound and cananeas sales are soaring 
in 1987 the company had net earnings of 233 million on sales 
of 1865 million a 300 percent increase from the year before 
according to expansion 
rojas estimated production this year at 125652 metric tons of 
pure copper 
quijano said the government has treated workers better than any 
of the private owners who he said carried off everything and 
left us nothing 
said quijano now that its making money they want to sell it 
we hope they dont find any buyers

about 45 million less than it paid for the unit two years ago 
ameritech said tuesday that computer associates international of 
garden city ny which was one of several firms that looked into 
buying adr has agreed to buy the software unit

millions of dollars into research and development the software 
unit is believed to have lost money in 1986 and 1987 
adr is a major supplier of computer software to the army and air 
force

associates will make large staff cuts at adr which has between 
1600 and 1700 employees industry analysts said

to do 
we have very little product overlap with adr so we might not 
do that much said michael fisher senior vice president at

what makes sense

fujitsu inc a japanese company

american business is picking up a strong message 
you can sell to japan it may not be easy but its not impossible 
washington is heavily promoting an export drive as a major 
component of the reagan administrations strategy to reduce the 
us trade deficit especially with japan which had a 60 billion 
surplus in trade with the united states last year 
the dollars drop over the past three years has helped by making 
japanese goods more expensive to buy in the united states but if 
the japanese do not buy more usmade products the us deficit 
will never disappear 
us commerce secretary c william verity led executives of 25 
american consumerproducts companies to japan over the past week to 
promote their entry into the japanese market the trip appears to 
have met with some success 
the experience has been very enlightening to say the least 
norman jacobs vice president of eastpak said of his look at the 
fashion luggage market in tokyo 
we never really intended to get into exporting in this stage 
of our development he said describing his bostonbased 
companys growth as averaging 35 percent a year for 11 years while 
concentrating mostly on the us market for fashionable bags 
jacobs said his company had noticed some japanese travelers had 
bought eastpak goods and then reordered 
we thought at first we were selling because of style but were 
overpriced he said but after spending a few days looking at 
the market in tokyo he said i was very surprised to find we are 
very pricecompetitive 
the verityled mission was jacobs first trip to japan he said 
this has opened up a brand new horizon to us and were going to 
be back as often as it takes 
jacobs reaction to japanese price levels is typical of 
firsttime american visitors calculated in todays devalued 
dollars everything is expensive here but the japanese are used to 
current prices in yen since this country has negligible inflation 
and many people have incomes high enough to sustain luxury buying 
by us standards 
at a meeting with reporters last weekend verity said he was 
leading the trade mission to alert more american businesses to the 
opportunity in exporting american companies are not oriented to 
the world market because they think they are doing well enough in 
the big us market he said 
if you feel were handholding youre right verity said 
he said he hoped to see the us trade deficit down 15 percent 
to 20 percent in 1988 that is what our exportpromotion program 
is all about he said predicting that in the coming years the 
us economy will be driven by exports 
some significant improvement in trade has already been 
registered according to the latest figures released by the us 
government the commerce department said wednesday that the us 
merchandise trade deficit shrank to 95 billion in july the 
lowest monthly imbalance since december 1984 
the dramatic 28 percent improvement in the trade deficit 
reflected a small increase in exports and a big decline in imports 
verity said he was disappointed that us construction companies 
had not shown much interest in the opening that washington 
bargained hard to win on major construction projects in japan but 
he predicted they would jump into the market when they saw japanese 
contracts going to other foreign countries 
during veritys weeklong mission the harry winston jewelry 
firm opened a shop in central tokyo and winnebago industries 
makers of recreational vehicles got a lavish promotional party for 
its linkup with mitsubishi corp which will market 
iowamanufactured winnebago vehicles in japan 
other companies on the mission had meetings with potential 
japanese distributors and sought openings for products ranging from 
furniture and sporting goods to yachts processed foods and pet 
foods 
the us embassy in tokyo says recent trade promotions have 
succeeded beyond expectations

shares traded tuesday 
the us trade deficit shrank to 953 billion in july from a 
revised 1334 billion gap in june many analysts had been looking 
for a deficit of about 115 billion for july 
experts said london shares failed to react to the us trade 
news because there are still grave concerns facing the british 
economy particularly its own trade deficit problem 
the subdued response to the figures can only be attributed to 
the fact that institutional sentiment remains unenthusiastic 
towards the uk market one analyst said 
paul harrison a director at county natwest woodmac in london 
said interest rate concerns continue to weigh on the british market 
there were some worries in the back of peoples minds that 
with the dollar surging and sterling under pressure there might be 
another round of interest rate increases to lift the pound he 
said 
several market watchers said traders in london found it 
disturbing that wall street did not sustain an advance on the trade

following the lead of pan am corp several major us airlines 
have sharply reduced their air fares to europe 
pan am on tuesday announced a new roundtrip restricted fare of 
298 to london from new york washington detroit and miami the 
new fare represents a 41 percent cut from the airlines previous 
lowest fare of 508 for the same route pan am spokeswoman pamela 
hanlon said wednesday 
in addition to the london super eurosaver pan am said it 
also is offering new eurosaver fares to 22 other european 
cities that are up to 30 percent cheaper 
american airlines northwest airlines and trans world airlines 
inc quickly said they would match the new fares in the markets 
where they compete with pan am continental airlines said it was 
studying the possibility of fare cuts but had made no decision 
the reductions are designed to stimulate us passenger traffic 
to europe which has suffered recently from the dollars decline 
against major foreign currencies 
in addition ms hanlon said it is part of a strategy for pan 
am to move away from the use of travel consolidators who buy large 
volumes of discounted tickets from airlines mark them up 10 
percent to 20 percent and then resell them to travel agents and 
consumers 
it is part of a strategy to move away from the consolidators 
offering a competitive product directly to the public and through 
the retail travel agents she said 
the 298 pan am london fare can be used for travel only on 
certain days of the week and the first day of travel must be 
between oct 16 and dec 7 travel must be completed by dec 15 
the nonrefundable tickets must be purchased 45 days in advance 
except for those bought before sept 30 
eurosaver fares to other european cities must be purchased 
30 days in advance and within 48 hours of making the reservation 
they also are nonrefundable the cities include paris rome 
frankfurt west germany athens greece brussels belgium and 
zurich switzerland

the us merchandise trade deficit shrank to 
95 billion in july the lowest monthly imbalance since december 
1984 the government said today in a report that sent stock prices 
higher 
the commerce department said the dramatic 28 percent improvement 
in the trade deficit reflected a small increase in exports and a 
big decline in imports 
the latest trade deficit was certain to cheer republican 
presidential candidate george bush who has been trying to deflect 
charges from democrat michael dukakis that the countrys soaring 
trade deficits demonstrate a major flaw in the reagan economic 
program 
the july deficit was substantially better than economists had 
expected the government did however boost the june deficit to 
132 billion from the originally reported 125 billion 
the june deficit was the biggest trade shortfall since a 144 
billion deficit in february a figure that had sent the dow jones 
industrial average tumbling by 100 points 
the july deficit had the opposite effect 
by early afternoon the dow jones industrial average was up more 
than 7 points at one point in the first hour of trading the 
average had risen more than 17 points 
president reagan hailed the report telling an audience in cape 
girardeau mo that it was very good news he added 
the message is going out to every corner of the world when 
america goes into the market to compete we play to win others may 
talk we deliver 
commerce secretary c william verity said in a statement that 
compared with the same seven months of last year exports surged 
28 percent while imports rose less than 10 percent 
jay goldinger an economist with capital insight a los angeles 
investment firm predicted that the deficit figures would likely 
remain in the singledigit range in coming months as us 
manufacturers continue to reap the benefits from the decline in the 
value of the dollar 
our exports continue to climb because our goods are cheaper 
and imports are declining because we have finally found a price 
high enough to stop consumers from buying imported goods he said 
a weaker dollar in addition to making us products cheaper on 
overseas markets makes imports more expensive for american 
consumers 
for the first seven months of this year the us trade deficit 
has been running at an annual average of 1375 billion down 193 
percent from the record 1703 billion deficit suffered in 1987 
the significant narrowing in the trade deficit this year has 
been a major factor behind the economys betterthanexpected 
economic performance analysts said that more than half of all 
economic growth this year is coming from the narrowing trade gap 
us exports are booming as the weaker dollar has made american 
goods competitive once again on world markets a factor that has 
helped push factory operating rates to the highest level in eight 
years 
the 95 billion july imbalance between exports and imports was 
only the second singledigit deficit in the last three years and 
was the lowest since a 803 billion deficit in december 1984 the 
deficit had declined to 976 billion in may 
the july improvement reflected a big 89 percent drop in 
imports which declined to 3599 billion from a record june figure 
of 3950 billion 
exports were up by a smaller 07 percent to 265 billion 
keeping them near the record levels they have been at for the last 
several months 
the big drop in imports came primarily in bigticket capital 
goods which dropped by 12 billion to 8 billion this category 
had risen sharply the previous month as us companies had looked 
abroad for the equipment needed to expand their own production 
facilities 
also dropping sharply in july were car imports which fell by 
803 million with almost all of that decline coming from a drop in 
shipments of cars from canada 
on the export side the improvement reflected increases in a 
variety of products led by a 600 million rise in sales of capital 
goods 
as usual the country suffered its biggest deficit with japan a 
44 billion imbalance which was unchanged from june the deficit 
with western europe rose to 23 billion from 19 billion in june 
the deficits with taiwan and canada were unchanged at 12 billion 
and 11 billion respectively 
with the release of todays report the government resumed a 
practice abandoned in 1979 of simultaneously reporting the import 
figures with the cost of shipping and insurance removed 
using this system the deficit for july would have been an even 
lower 807 billion down from a june imbalance minus shipping and 
insurance of 117 billion 
the monthly merchandise trade figure for july was the second 
good report on trade in as many days the government said tuesday 
that the deficit in the current account for the apriljune quarter 
shrank by 98 percent to 333 billion this report includes not 
only the trade in merchandise which is reported on a monthly bass 
but also trade in services mainly the flow of investment earnings 
across borders 
in a second upbeat report today the government said that us 
industrial production posted a moderate 02 percent increase in 
august reflecting in part the boom in manufacturing caused by 
foreign sales

improved us trade figures pushed the dollar 
sharply higher in active trading in europe wednesday but the 
currency was prevented from rising further by fear of central bank 
intervention 
gold prices also rose 
the dollar inched up in the morning and was trading at about 
18550 west german marks when the commerce department announced 
that the us trade deficit in july was 95 billion considerably 
narrower than the 11 billion to 12 billion gap that the market 
had been expecting 
the dollar shot up almost two pfennigs and then subsided 
slightly to about 18700 marks before rising again late in the day 
dealers said the dollars rise was curtailed by fear that the 
central banks would seek to knock the currency down those fears 
were followed by unconfirmed reports later in new york that the 
federal reserve had stepped in to sell dollars 
in london the dollar soared against the british pound it cost 
16750 to buy one pound cheaper than late tuesdays 16965

british film producer david puttnam said wednesday 
he has formed a fouryear joint venture with warner brothers inc 
and other international investors to back his next six major 
feature films 
the announcement came about a year after puttnam who has 
produced such films as the killing fields and chariots of 
fire resigned as chairman and chief executive of cocacola cos 
columbia pictures after completing only 15 months of a threeyear 
contract 
puttnam 47 left the studio after cocacola merged columbia 
pictures with tristar pictures and brought victor kaufman in as 
president and chief executive of the combined operation 
during his brief tenure in hollywood puttnam reportedly clashed 
with members of the entertainment industry establishment 
in addition to warner brothers and puttnams own company enigma 
productions the partners in the joint venture are fujisankei 
communications japans largest mass communications company 
british satellite broadcasting and county natwest ventures the 
venture capital unit of national westminster bank plc 
at a news conference puttnam refused to disclose the exact size 
of each partners stake saying only that we regard ourselves as 
equal partners 
he will produce the films through enigma which will have a 
production fund of 50 million in addition to income it makes from 
its films 
the venture intends to make movies aimed at a broad 
international audience 
we all share a perspective which tells us that films can and 
should be made for the international marketplace said terry 
semel president of warner brothers which is based in burbank 
calif 
asked if he would continue his efforts to cut production costs 
which proved unpopular in hollywood puttnam said one thing ive 
learned is to try and resist ideologies 
the producer said he intends to cast the best people for the 
best films as possible 
warner brothers semel said he can make hit films with both 
unknown and known filmmakers 
puttnam said he expects the venture to release its first film in 
the autumn of 1990 
the ventures movies will be distributed worldwide by warner 
brothers with two exceptions fujisankei will be responsible for 
video and television distribution in japan and british satellite 
broadcasting has acquired the british satellite television rights 
the fujisankei group includes the fuji television network and 
the sankei shimbun newspapers and publishing companies

the senate today confirmed the nomination of 
investment banker nicholas f brady to serve as treasury secretary 
during the remaining four months of the reagan administration 
the 922 vote installed brady with time to spare before a 
meeting late next week in west berlin of finance ministers from the 
worlds industrial powers 
senators of both parties were anxious for a strong vote of 
confidence to strengthen bradys hand in the meeting of the g7 as 
the finance ministers group is known 
if we did not confirm nick brady he would go with a little 
bit of a cloud over his head to an important international meeting 
nothing could serve the congress or the country more than to give 
nick brady a unanimous vote of approval sen bob packwood of 
oregon ranking republican on the senate finance committee said 
shortly before the vote 
sen kent conrad dnd sounded one of the few discordant 
notes voting against the nomination after criticizing brady for 
saying during his confirmation hearing that the federal government 
could grow its way out of the budget deficit 
mr brady says dont worry well grow out of it well the 
truth is different and the truth will out conrad said 
sen harry reid dnev also voted against the nomination 
brady upon being sworn in will be the third treasury secretary 
to serve under president reagan donald regan who later became 
white house chief of staff held the cabinet post from 1981 to 
1985 turning it over to james a baker iii 
although brady is expected to do little more than serve as a 
caretaker this year he would be the most likely candidate to serve 
as treasury secretary if republican presidential candidate george 
bush wins 
the finance committee had voted 150 on tuesday to recommend 
confirmation of the popular former senator 
at the committee hearing brady promised he would reassure the 
g7 of his intent to continue the economic cooperation policies of 
his predecessor 
the steady decline of the value of the dollar since september 
1985 coordinated by the united states and its economic allies has 
been credited with reviving us sales abroad and reducing the 
trade deficit this year 
brady delivered generally upbeat remarks to the committee on the 
prospects of narrowing both the trade gap and the federal budget 
deficit 
he even managed to get credit for a stock market rally late in 
the day 
responding to senators concerns that the trade deficit still 
was too large brady urged them to give us companies time to 
respond to the fall in the value of the dollar 
we have to give the system a chance to work my prediction is 
that the trade deficit is going to come down and one of the 
surprises of the next two or three years is how fast it will come 
down he said 
analysts cited the comments as the reason for a lastminute 
surge in the price of stocks which had been slightly lower for 
much of the day traders apparently interpreted the remarks as 
hinting that the governments report on the july trade deficit 
would be favorable 
it was the government reported today that the deficit shrank to 
95 billion the lowest in nearly four years 
brady also said growing overseas investment in the united 
states which has risen as foreigners purchase us assets with the 
dollars they earn from selling goods here can be taken as a sign 
of the economys strength and of foreigners faith in it 
on the federal budget deficit brady praised both the 
administration and congress for their efforts which have whittled 
the deficit from 220 billion in 1986 to an estimated 150 billion 
this year 
i do think we can grow our way out of this he said adding 
at another point i see no reason at this moment why taxes have 
to be raised 
sen max baucus dmont urged brady to offer more than 
platitudes on the budget brady declined to recommend 
specifics but promised to present congress with new ideas for 
reducing the deficit by the end of the year 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the chairman of the finance 
committee and the democratic vice presidential candidate gave 
brady a warm endorsement even though brady is a close adviser to 
bush 
nick brady is a friend and former colleague and in my opinion 
is a man who is well qualified to be treasury secretary bentsen 
said its a big job a tough job but youre used to tough 
jobs 
in his latest government assignment brady headed a presidential 
task force that studied the causes of the october stock market 
crash his report called for greater regulation over some aspects 
of the markets and was met with a cold shoulder by the 
administration 
brady said market reforms put in place since the crash have been 
on the right track declining to criticize the administration 
for not doing everything his commission advised 
im not sure we were 100 percent right we did our work in 60 
days he said 
on another matter brady said federal savings and loan 
regulators have as much as they can spend for now on sampl rescues 
and he said he saw no reason for now for a taxpayer bailout of 
the industry 
bradys greatgrandfather founded electric utilities that later 
became part of consolidated edison co and his grandfather started 
a precursor of dodge motor co now a division of chrysler corp 
the family also founded purolator co 
brady 58 is cochairman of dillon read amp co an oldline wall 
street investment firm which he joined in 1954 after receiving a 
masters degree in business from harvard university 
in 1982 he represented new jersey for eight months in the 
senate by appointment filling the seat of democrat harrison a 
williams jr who had resigned following his conviction in the 
abscam influencepeddling scandal

a federal judge today approved the partial 
merger of detroits two daily newspapers under a joint operating 
arrangement granted earlier by thenattorney general edwin meese 
iii 
us district judge george revercombs decision approving the 
partial merger of the detroit free press and the detroit news came 
a month after the deal was temporarily put on hold by court order 
to give opponents a chance to mount a legal challenge 
revercomb said the stay issued last month blocking the merger 
will be allowed to expire at 715 pm edt saturday 
the court finds that the attorney general was not unreasonable 
in finding that the free press a newspaper that has incurred and 
will continue to incur losses that would already have led to its 
demise were it not owned by a large corporate parent is a failing 
newspaper he said 
william b schultz who represented the plaintiffs would not 
comment on the decision and would not say whether he planned an 
appeal until he has had an opportunity to read the opinion and 
consult with his clients 
michigan citizens for an independent press a group of readers 
and advertisers in the detroit area had contended that the free 
press owned by knightridder inc was not a failing newspaper 
entitled to antitrust exemptions under the 1980 newspaper 
preservation act 
the group noted that meese approved the joint operating 
arrangement before he left office even though an administrative law 
judge and the justice departments antitrust division had 
recommended against it 
opponents of the partial merger represented by ralph naders 
public citizen litigation group argued that the free press and the 
news had each cut advertising and circulation rates to drive the 
other out of business 
the publishers willingness to suffer losses for several years 
was sustained by the knowledge that the two dailies might 
eventually qualify for a joint operating agreement merging the two 
publications commercial operations the opponents contended 
but revercomb concluded that meese was not unreasonable in 
concluding that the free press was primarily motivated by 
competitive aims not a joa in its recent business strategies 
the judge dismissed the plaintiffs argument that meeses 
findings were flawed because he accepted the factual findings but 
not the conclusions of the administrative law judge it is not 
clear that the attorney general disagreed with the law judges 
fact findings as much much as his inferences derived from facts 
the administrative law judges finding shows that the prospect 
of a joa played at most a secondary or supporting role in the 
newspapers motivations revercomb said 
the justice department maintained in court last week there was 
no evidence of collusion between the free press and the news 
purchased by the gannett co inc in 1986 several months before 
the two papers sought the joint operating agreement 
knightridder inc has threatened to close the morning free 
press which has lost 100 million over the last nine years unless 
the partial merger was allowed to go forward 
at a hearing last week knightridders attorney clark 
clifford said the detroit area would lose 2200 jobs if the free 
press closed compared to the 600 to 800 layoffs that would result 
from the consolidation of the two newspapers business advertising 
and circulation departments 
under the proposed joint operating agreement the papers would 
maintain separate editorial staffs to put out separate daily 
editions combined editions would be published on weekends 
clifford said the free press was powerless to cut losses by 
raising its prices unless the news first raised its circulation and 
advertising rates 
the news which has also sustained significant losses was 
determined to drive the free press out of business if a joint 
operating agreement was not approved he said 
according to the audit bureau of circulation the free press had 
a daily circulation last year of 638720 daily compared to the 
news 678720 on sundays the news held a slightly larger lead 
839319 to 724342

grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade on new export demand and 
speculation that hurricane gilbert posed a threat to crops 
analysts said 
analysts said gilberts recordhigh winds and heavy rain were 
not likely to cause serious damage to soybean crops in louisiana 
and mississippi since few of those fields are near the gulf coast 
but storms spawned by the hurricane could play havoc with corn 
and soybean crops in the midwest where a summer drought has 
weakened the stalks of many plants analysts said 
corn also benefitted from tuesdays news that the soviet union 
had purchased 350000 metric tons of us corn from private 
exporters said walter spilka a grainmarket analyst in new york 
with smith barney harris upham amp co 
wheat futures were supported by reports that morocco and jordan 
had bid for us wheat spilka said 
the wheat market is acting very well and adding exports adds 
strength to it he said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 412 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with september at 285 a bushel oats 
were cent to 3 cents higher with september at 268 a bushel 
soybeans were 5 cents lower to 5 cents higher with september at 
881 a bushel

aluminum co of america said wednesday that 
7000 salaried employees in its domestic aluminum operations will 
participate in a profitsharing plan beginning this year 
officials said the plan would create a profitsharing pool when 
the companys us operations exceed a return of 6 percent on 
assets they said employees would share 17 percent of profits above 
this threshold 
alcoa officials said individual payouts will vary with profits 
and the number of employees involved the plan is retroactive to 
jan 1 the company said 
alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of each 
employees base salary if secondhalf 1988 profits equal firsthalf 
profits 
in contract negotiations three weeks ago the company offered a 
profitsharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to 
1300 for bluecollar workers based on alcoas expected 1988 
profits 
the united steelworkers of america union said it rejected the 
plan as inadequate and said it opposed the companys plan to extend 
it to salaried whitecollar workers 
on aug 24 the usw and the aluminum brick and glass workers 
unions broke off early negotiations with alcoa after rejecting 
offers that included profitsharing an immediate ratification 
bonus annual lump sum bonuses an improved medical insurance 
option and increased pension benefits 
usw negotiator george becker said the talks ended because alcoa 
would not address several key issues including wage and 
pension increases 
the unions sought new contracts to recover concessions 
negotiated in 1986 when the aluminum industry faced difficult 
economic times

latin american and caribbean nations 
wednesday pledged to take the initiative in solving their debt 
crisis as they began an annual round of talks on regional economic 
problems 
carlos perez de castillo secretarygeneral of the 26member 
latin american economic system sela called for a new approach on 
the regions 410 billion debt which does not mean decreeing a 
moratorium or creating a debtors club 
he said it could mean reaching agreement on a common negotiating 
framework which would include linking debt payments to export 
income limiting interest rates and paying according to the market 
value of the debts 
sela must take a serious initiative regarding the foreign 
debt perez del castillo told delegates at the opening of the 
technical meeting of selas 14th annual council the threeday 
ministerial level meeting begins sept 19 
we are convinced that the solutions to the regions problems 
will not come from abroad latin america must make a united effort 
to generate its own initiatives he said 
he also recommended that latin america use its annual 65 
billion in imports from industrialized nations as a negotiating 
tool to equalize trade in the face of growing protectionism 
everything the region exports is negotiated but what we 
import is not negotiated this form of commercial relations must 
change he said 
perezs call for greater regional action comes as the 
international monetary fund and the world bank which begin their 
annual assembly sept 27 in west berlin admit that their 
marketoriented approach to solving the latin american debt problem 
has not had the desired results 
the imf lends to debtors which agree to adopt austerity policies 
to promote economic stability but latin american debtors claim 
that the policies limit their ability to grow out of their debts 
in its 1987 annual report the imf notes that the debt burden 
was a key factor in causing latin american economies to shrink by 
15 percent overall last year 
there remains much to be done to relieve the weight of the 
debt and restore world growth imf director michel camdessus said 
in the reports introduction

zenith electronics corps largest shareholder 
frustrated by the companys steep losses in recent years announced 
plans wednesday to seize control of the company and sell it 
brookhurst partners a new york investor group with a 61 
percent stake in zenith said it planned to wage a proxy fight to 
reduce the size of zeniths board of directors from 10 seats to six 
and to replace three of the six directors with its own nominees 
our decision is based on the firm conviction that direction is 
needed to ensure the boards compliance with the collective will of 
the companys shareholders the dissident group said in a letter 
to zeniths board 
spokesman john taylor said zenith officials had not seen a copy 
of the lawsuit so it is inappropriate to comment 
zenith the last remaining us television manufacturer has 
been fighting a losing battle against lowpriced imported 
televisions 
despite the success of its highly regarded computers zenith 
suffered multimilliondollar losses for the past three years 
including a loss of 191 million last year on sales of 236 
billion 
the companys stock gained 12 cents wednesday in composite 
trading on the new york stock exchange closing at 2175 
peter harkins general counsel for brookhurst partners said in 
a telephone interview that the group would seek written consents 
from shareholders to undertake its plan 
he said brookhurst had filed a lawsuit in us district court in 
delaware challenging a provision in zeniths articles of 
incorporation that requires the unanimous consent of all 
stockholders for an action initiated by written consent to be 
effective 
brookhurst claims the provision violates delaware laws 
guaranteeing the right of stockholders to take action by written 
consent he said zenith is incorporated in delaware 
zenith posted a profit of 400000 or 1 cent a share on sales 
of 5741 million in the first quarter of 1988 but had a second 
quarter loss of 121 million 
zenith chairman jerry k pearlman has said repeatedly since 
april that the board was exploring all options for returning 
the company to profitability including selling its 
televisionmaking consumer electronics unit 
but brookhurst formed by herbert b abelow and nicholas l 
ihasz specifically to acquire zenith stock said it no longer could 
tolerate the boards apparent inaction or its strategy of cutting 
costs while waiting for television prices to stablilize 
in our view this can lead only to increased debt lower 
earnings inadequate cash flow and more serious financial 
difficulties the partnership said in its letter 
other major shareowners have expressed to us their agreement 
with our views and frustration with the board of directors 
continuing failure to enhance share value 
abelow ihasz and paul street would be the three brookhurst 
nominees to zeniths board harkins said 
the partnership proposes to retain directors john h johnson 
wilbur h gantz and frederick g jaicks none of whom work for 
zenith and to dump pearlman harry b beckner sidney davidson g 
ralph gurthrie robert b hansen john w madigan and arthur w 
schultz harkins said
