at first glance rep richard cheney might seem 
an unlikely candidate to run the pentagon but his selection by 
president bush won early rave reviews in congress 
in picking the sixterm republican from wyoming bush moved 
quickly on friday to fill the void left by the senates rejection of 
john tower less than 24 hours earlier 
and while the announcement caught most political leaders by 
surprise the cheney choice at once fulfilled two objectives bush 
advisers had cited as critical someone quickly available and 
someone quickly confirmable 
to allow the politically divisive tower defeat to fester over the 
weekend and to be churned over on sunday television talk shows and 
in newspaper columns would have not been helpful to the president 
so far the movequick strategy seems to be working senate 
leaders announced immediately that they would hold confirmation 
hearings in the coming week 
congressman dick cheney is well known and highly respected by 
the members of the senate the chairman of the senate armed 
services committee sam nunn dga and the panels ranking 
republican john warner of virginia said in a joint statement 
although cheney 48 lacks direct defense experience he is a 
member of the house intelligence committee and was senior republican 
on the 15member special panel that investigated the irancontra 
affair 
equally important he served as president fords chief of staff 
in selecting cheney whom bush praised as a widely respected 
man of principle the president repeated what he had done in 
filling many other cabinet slots he reached back and picked 
someone whom had served in a previous republican administration and 
with whom he had enjoyed a close working relationship 
cheney did not get wind of what was in store until thursday as 
the senate was at work rejecting tower when he got telephone calls 
from chief of staff john sununu and national security adviser brent 
scowcroft 
bush himself didnt contact the candidate until just hours before 
the official announcement 
the presidents choice makes sense said norman ornstein a 
political analyst for the conservative american enterprise institute 
you wouldnt have thought of him initially because hes not a 
defense specialist but in terms of respect in congress hes near 
the top of everyones list 
if dick cheney cant make it through the confirmation process 
no one can ornstein said bush had to find someone who could 
sail through and it was a wise choice 
bush himself called cheney a thoughtful man a quiet man a 
strong man who approaches public policy with vigor 
determination and diligence 
and judging from early reaction most members of the senate 
appear to agree cheney has few detractors 
i have the greatest respect for his broad range of experience 
and knowledge said sen john mccain rariz a member of the 
senate armed services committee who had been one of towers 
strongest supporters i look favorably on this nomination and hope 
that he will be confirmed expeditiously 
an excellent choice said sen charles robb of virginia one 
of the last democrats to announce opposition to tower unless 
there is a complete void in that area defense the confirmation 
should move rapidly 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine praised cheney as 
a man who served with distinction in the house and promised 
prompt consideration by the senate armed services committee and 
the full senate 
for his part cheney said he had extensive views on defense 
policy and said he was eager to get to work 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said there was a 
consensus in the white house that the clock was ticking after the 
tower defeat bush was being encouraged by everyone to do it in a 
hurry fitzwater said 
bush himself said if he had made a mistake in handling the tower 
nomination it was the long delay in sending it to the senate 
so when it became clear thursday that the votes werent there 
i began to think and talk to my top advisers here get opinions 
from them said bush 
and when he finally talked to cheney at 1 pm on friday the 
president recalled i said i want to make a decision fast on this 
because i know him well and have known him over the years well and 
so thats about the way it evolved

on monday lisa malone changes all that 
the 27yearold public affairs specialist with nasa at the 
kennedy space center will replace hugh harris as the voice of 
shuttle launch control for the liftoff of discovery it will be the 
first time a woman has served as launch commentator for a flight 
carrying astronauts 
her job will be to guide the news media and the public through 
the anxious minutes before the main engines ignite in a burst of 
flame and smoke until the shuttle clears the launch tower and 
communications switch to the johnson space center in houston 
her challenge to explain what is taking place behind the scenes 
and to translate the technical chatter among launch managers into 
something that anybody can understand 
malone is quick to contrast the significance of her new role with 
that of female astronauts 
i think what theyre doing is a lot more trendsetting and 
important than what a commentator does she said because 
theyre actually doing it instead of reporting on whats been done 
nevertheless malone said she likes to think her voice will be 
an inspiration to young women 
if that would inspire somebody to go on and achieve what they 
want in life she says i think that is fantastic 
malone has worked for nasa for seven years rising to her 
position of space shuttle specialist from a college workstudy 
program that started while she was earning a bachelors degree in 
journalism from the university of alabama in tuscaloosa 
she edited the space center newsletter spaceport news for three 
years before she was assigned to the space shuttle beat now she 
attends several daily meetings of launch managers to stay uptodate 
on the progress of work to get three orbiters and their external 
fuel tanks and booster rockets ready for flight 
to prepare for her debut malone provided launch commentary for 
some unmanned atlas centaur and delta launches and for the early 
portions of some shuttle countdowns she has watched numerous 
launches from her seat at the firing room console beside harris who 
is now deputy director for public affairs at kennedy space center 
she also hired a voice coach 
although she has learned the lingo and has carefully prepared a 
script malone knows her biggest challenge will be the realtime 
element of the job and how shell react if theres an unexpected 
problem during the countdown 
youre going to be scrambling to try and figure out what it is 
because you want to have the right story before you tell the world 
whats going on malone said

time passes slowly for stefania follini 
the italian woman has fallen into a routine of staying awake 23 
hours then sleeping for 10 after being holed up in a cave for two 
months as part of a research project into the effects of isolation 
she has no sun radios or clocks to guide her sense of time and 
little contact with other humans 
sunday feb 12 10 am miss follini writes on a computer 
at a desk in her plastic habitat at one end of the cave 
actually its noon on wednesday march 8 
on jan 13 the 27yearold miss follini climbed 30 feet below 
the earths surface and into the 200footlong lost cave in the 
hills west of carlsbad to begin a four to fivemonth isolation 
experiment an italian research group is sponsoring the experiment 
along with various us universities and the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
as she moves about in her tworoom 200squarefoot plexiglas 
house miss follini resembles a laboratory rat in a cage 
researchers monitor her with three video cameras and microphones 
and they type in occasional messages to her computer but miss 
follini cannot see or hear another human 
during her waking hours she sometimes taps away at her computer 
like a subject in a bf skinner experiment as researchers in a 
trailer above record the results of tests of her concentration 
memory and reasoning ability 
one thing researchers are discovering in isolation experiments 
intended among other things to give them insight into how humans 
might react on interplanetary space flights is that men tend to be 
more cheerful in long isolation than women 
maurizio montalbini the experiment coordinator who once spent 
six months isolated in a cave alludes to that in a brief computer 
conversation in italian with his fellow native of ancona italy 
you should change your sex montalbini writes to the 
glumlooking miss follini you always seem like a sad one 
i feel sadder some times than others she replies 
after chatting via computer for a little bit montalbini asks 
miss follini to take the series of computerized mental tests which 
she performs about once a week miss follini who had been 
interrupted from reading a novel to take the medical measurements 
and relay them by computer becomes a little sarcastic 
great idea like a dessert she responds 
an interior decorator by profession miss follini has livened up 
her 10by10foot living area with colorful figures cut out of 
construction paper and glued to the walls among the paper 
decorations wine bottles a flower box and a window covered 
with blue paper lace curtains that looks out onto a white paper 
moon and stars a brown paper cat sits beside the windowsill 
miss follini spends much of her time kneeling on a blue mat 
reading she brought 400 books with her novels histories english 
primers she stays in shape by practicing judo moves 
she is remarkably quiet 
even though researchers can hear her she prefers to communicate 
with them by computer 
she does talk a little to her pets two mice she dubbed giuseppe 
and nicoleta and a salamander all found in the cave she keeps a 
vigil to prevent the rodents from gnawing at cables or eating her 
food which consists mostly of rice and beans she cooks on an 
electric stove 
longterm space flight might be a lot like this except for the 
lack of gravity in space 
medical researchers are especially interested in finding out what 
isolation does to ones emotional and mental wellbeing 
stefania is fine says andrea galvagno an italian doctor who 
alternates 24hour monitoring shifts with montalbini as of now 
she hasnt expressed any desire that deals with the outside world 
but it appears miss follinis world isnt quite a utopia she 
occasionally attaches electrodes to her head before she falls asleep 
so researchers can study her brain waves in various stages of sleep 
and the results show symptoms of mild depression 
galvagno says he and montalbini sometimes joke around with miss 
follini to buoy her spirits 
montalbini says miss follinis ability to concentrate has 
deteriorated in previous experiments people in isolation alone 
have improved their concentration while members of groups isolated 
in caves have lost their concentration 
about this time around 430 pm miss follini walks over to her 
computer types in ciaoooooooo waves to the video camera dims 
the lights they always stay on lies on the mat under a blanket 
and stares at the camera a while 
presently she closes her eyes and falls asleep stefania follini

a holocaust survivors hebrew translation of 
mein kampf has touched off a controversy over whether the book 
which inspired the slaughter of 6 million jews should be published 
in israel 
author dan yaron argued sunday that a hebrew edition of the adolf 
hitlers manifesto will educate young israelis about the evils of 
the nazi regime other holocaust survivors say it should never 
appear on israeli bookshelves 
so far yaron has not found a publisher 
its not easy to get someone to publish a book that is 
connected to hitler said yaron who spent the past 18 months 
translating the first volume of mein kampf 
but 50 years after hitler we must be strong enough to look at 
who he was said yaron who fled his native vienna in 1938 after 
watching nazi troops parade down the main street of the austrian 
capital 
yaron a retired educator said in an interview that young jews 
should read mein kampf as a warning against racist ideology he 
said for example that there were disturbing antiarab sentiments 
expressed by extreme right israeli politicians 
the new generation needs to know about the dangers that can 
occur he said there are israelis who promote racism 
yaron said the fact his parents were killed by the nazis while 
trying to escape from austria has strengthened his determination to 
see the book published in israel 
if people like my father would have had the internal 
strength to read the book they would have known and things would 
have ended differently he said 
other holocaust refugees vehemently disagree with yaron saying 
publication would stir deep emotion in a nation that was founded in 
part to shelter the survivors of the nazi horrors 
if it is published there will be battles in the street 
predicted noah klieger a survivor of the aushwitz concentration 
camp who covers holocaust affairs for the daily yediot ahronot 
newspaper 
we need freedom of opinion but there is a limit and hitler is 
the limit he said in an interview the man who wrote this book 
destroyed physically destroyed a third of the jewish people 
stefan grayek president of the world federation of jewish 
fighters partisans and camp inmates also opposes publication 
jews dont need to read about the worst antisemitism the world 
has ever seen he said we dont need to revive hitler 
certainly not in israel definitely not in hebrew 
he said some holocaust survivors were considering legal action to 
stop publication but he said the federation decided against doing 
anything believing there was no real interest in the book 
if published he said i think the book will end up in a 
warehouse and not peoples bookshelves grayek said 
the yad vashem national holocaust memorial has refused a request 
to publish the translation a spokesman for yad vashem said 
i question why anyone would publish the book said spokesman 
menahem fogel its going to upset a lot of people and i cant 
see it selling a lot of copies 
the book is available in its original language and if 
researchers want to gain access to the book it is best that they 
study it in the original language he said

when democratic sen sam nunn came under 
republican attack during the debate over john towers nomination as 
defense secretary majority leader george mitchell stepped forward 
to deflect the blows 
and when the republicans switched gears and insisted that the key 
issue was president bushs prerogative of picking his own cabinet 
mitchell deftly rebutted by cautioning against 
selfrighteousness 
dont get too locked into your present views the maine 
senator said after reciting chapter and verse a series of past gop 
votes against highlevel democratic appointees you may get into 
another one in not too long 
if george bush had much at stake in the tower fight that 
culminated with rejection of the nomination so did george mitchell 
a 55yearold maine native of maine whose rise to the pinnacle of 
power in the senate has been extremely rapid by congressional 
standards a former federal judge who was appointed to office in 
1980 he won an underdogs race for a sixyear term in 1982 and 
parlayed that into a landslide reelection in 1988 
he presided over the democratic campaign committee that helped 
oust the republican majority in 1986 and two years later he won a 
threeway race to become majority leader he has stressed 
cooperation with bush in the early months of his tenure yet also 
outlined a democratic agenda that includes ethics legislation 
environmental concerns and social issues such as raising the minimum 
wage 
still a miscue could have marred his first appearance in a 
leading role for a party trying to maintain its standing during 
lengthy republican control of the white house 
mitchell walked a narrow line he stressed throughout the debate 
that he meant no political injury to bush yet he also was the 
careful keeper of the vote count that sealed towers rejection 
he put his lowkey debating style on display for the first time 
in contrast to veteran gop leader bob doles more aggressive 
approach 
moreover mitchell apparently emerged without unduly antagonizing 
senators on the other side of the aisle 
dole said sunday on nbcs meet the press that the senate 
probably will be back to normal within a month or two despite 
bruised feelings over the tower episode 
i think you can say that the nomination is gone but not 
forgotten said dole the memories will be around for a while 
there will be some bruised feelings but i think in probably 30 to 
60 days well be back to normal the scars arent that deep 
one democratic committee chairman speaking anonymously said 
mitchells approach was to avoid the appearance of partisanship yet 
at the same time to support nunn and the democrats on the armed 
services committee who recommended rejection of towers nomination 
i thought he acted calm and cool throughout he made nobody mad 
on the democratic side said sen howell heflin dala one of 
three democrats to vote in favor of confirmation he never did any 
real what you call armtwisting 
in the same vein mitchell minimized the importance of the tower 
debate to his own political fortunes even as he acknowledged 
judgments inevitably would be made on how he performed 
after initially remaining in the background mitchell assumed an 
increasingly prominent role in the confirmation struggle 
mitchell learned monday night that the votes were in hand to 
defeat towers nomination and let the republicans know by telling 
reporters on tuesday 
the following day wednesday democrat lloyd bentsen of texas 
became the third democrat to announce his support of tower but then 
a string of three wavering democrats quickly came to the floor and 
declared their opposition the effect was to blunt the impact of 
bentsens longawaited decision and seal towers defeat it all bore 
the marks of skillful behindthescenes stage managing 
mitchell and nunn worked closely and several republicans said it 
was the decision by the highly respected nunn to oppose tower that 
made confirmation difficult to achieve 
yet when nunn himself came under attack from republicans for 
detailing investigators from a subcommittee he heads to check out 
allegations against tower mitchell came to his defense 
we are not going to get in a position here where one two 
three four five six seven people come over here and ask the same 
question and the senator nunn has to give the same answer over 
again said mitchell 
and he showcased his debating skills when he replied to 
persistent repulican claims that bush was entitled to have the 
nomination confirmed as a matter of presidential prerogative 
if they serve long enough he said all senators of both parties 
will inevitably contradict ourselves we will meet ourselves 
coming around the corner on some issue 
he cited repulican opposition to several appointments made by 
former president carter a decade ago and said there was no talk 
then about the president having his own way there was no talk then 
about the president winning the last election there was no talk 
then about the future of the confirmation process there was no talk 
then about the fairness of the process 
mitchell also worked to thwart doles more aggressive approach to 
the debate and his efforts to shake loose a few extra votes by 
accusing the democrats of treating tower unfairly 
when dole suggested that tower be given the right to come to the 
senate and respond to allegations against him mitchell immediately 
replied that he would be willing to give it serious consideration 
by not rejecting the proposal outright several democrats said the 
maine senator denied dole the right to level a fresh charge of 
unfairness 
and when dole finally made a formal proposal on the senate floor 
after the outcome of the struggle was clear mitchell blocked it 
and the republicans did not pursue it

the spotlight of the john tower controversy 
proved hotter than sam nunn had anticipated and the georgia senator 
now yearns for a chance to lower his profile 
id like to go down to houston county and check titles on real 
estate for about six months nunn told reporters at the annual 
meeting of the democratic leadership council 
the reporters laughed and the senator smiled but he looked like 
a man who meant what he said 
like it or not nunn will have to reconcile himself to a 
prominence most politicians would relish 
for the first time in his public career nunn was the target of 
partisan attacks from opponents who questioned his tactics and 
motives as the leader of the opposition to the tower nomination 
it was a trial by fire that seems to have strengthened his 
standing as a national figure president bush may not like the role 
nunn played in defeating his first choice to head the pentagon but 
the president seemed as eager as nunn to get the bitterness behind 
him 
before the tower debate nunn was seen as a figure apart from 
politics respected was the word most often used to describe the 
bespectacled georgian who had carved out a reputation as the 
senates foremost authority on defense issues 
the past couple of years saw a shift in nunns approach no 
longer did he shy away from partisan jabs at the republican 
administration he mulled a run for the 1988 democratic presidential 
nomination and campaigned extensively for michael dukakis in his 
illfated effort to regain the presidency for the democrats 
but the tower nomination was a much more dramatic step into the 
thick of partisan politics that battle over the question he often 
is asked is what next 
i have no plans or any inclination to run for president in 
1992 he said id like to have s much lower profile 
as chairman of the dlc nunn had the kind of forum he seems to 
relish one that features an often dry discussions of issues 
without question nunn was the dominant figure at the twoday 
meeting despite the presence of three of the contenders for the 
1988 democratic presidential nomination jesse jackson sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee and rep richard gephardt of missouri 
when the history of the 101st congress is written it will be 
about sam nunn said senate majority leader george mitchell of 
maine he represents the best that our democratic society has to 
offer 
mitchells tribute to nunn was all the more striking for being 
just one of many voiced during the conference 
but while nunn was bombarded with the sort of flattery that would 
prompt most politicians to begin thinking about their cabinet 
choices a bid for the presidency would make the fight over tower 
seem gentle 
nunn represents his partys most conservative wing 
while he commands unquestioned respect on defense issues his 
support for the reagan economic program would and his conservative 
positions on other domestic issues would raise bitter opposition 
from the party activists who still control the presidential 
nominating process 
the ideological split in the democratic party was dramatized by 
the presence at the dlc meeting of jackson who symbolizes an 
approach the dlc was created to combat 
reverend jackson is a very credible spokesman for his point of 
view said nunn obviously he and i have some very fundamental 
differences in philosophy 
those differences will not easily be bridged

its name is virtually synonymous with 
planning but 25 years after its founding as americas first planned 
city columbia belatedly is allowing for the one thing besides taxes 
that everyone must face death 
burying the dead wasnt on the minds of rouse co officials in 
1963 when they purchased 15000 acres of farmland and mapped out a 
city of the future consultants on recreation education sociology 
and other fields were hired to prescribe ideal living conditions for 
urbanites weary of depersonalized existence in washingtons 
metropolitan sprawl 
but somehow with its focus on living well columbia never made 
provisions for what comes afterward this city of 70500 souls had 
no cemetery 
my understanding is that it was overlooked in the beginning 
rouse co founder james rouse had very detailed plans he 
hired all kinds of experts the one expert he forgot was a cemetery 
expert said harvey geller who is one 
last year the rouse co turned over 28 acres in columbia to 
geller and assigned him to create a graveyard 
last monday geller watched as the first burial took place 
we had enough road to accommodate them luckily weve only 
cleared about five acres geller said 
in fact there isnt much to see of the columbia memorial park 
just a circular driveway inside a low curving stone wall so far 
about 20 plots have been sold and two funerals have been held 
columbias organizers have had little time to think about final 
resting places amenities of gracious living that are in place or on 
the drawing board include playgrounds bike and jogging paths a 
shopping mall cultural centers an athletic club golf course 
community pools and a bowling alley 
in the 1960s the city built in rural howard county 20 miles 
north of washington acquired a reputation for addressing urban 
problems through innovative comprehensive planning 
columbia which welcomed its first residents in 1967 is seeing 
its population graying the people who bought houses in columbia in 
their 30s and 40s are approaching retirement 
about 60 percent of howard countys senior citizens now live in 
columbia or in nearby ellicott city said bob callahan executive 
director of the florence bain senior center in columbia it was 
built as a young persons city but what happened was the old folks 
came to live near their kids callahan said 
al scavo a rouse vice president who is overseeing the cemetery 
said it has taken two decades for a graveyard to become economically 
feasible im not sure it was overlooked the market wasnt 
here he said 
its still not clear how large that market is as they approach 
their twilight years even residents who love columbia apparently 
are not anxious to stay there eternally 
the rev tom golueke of st johns catholic church said none of 
the 2400 families in his parish has mentioned a desire to be buried 
in columbia 
but having a cemetery in the community does give people some 
type of roots the priest said i guess you know youve made it 
as a city when you have a cemetery 
columbia residents began to talk about a cemetery in the 1970s 
but no developer was interested rouse finally ended up doing the 
first phase of construction itself and giving the land to geller to 
manage scavo said 
the cemetery is expected to be able to support itself after the 
25000 graves are sold probably in about 50 years cemeteries rely 
on trust funds financed by plot sales to pay for perpetual 
maintenance 
the company a stickler for design rules had its own ideas 
about how the tract was to look statues elaborate mausoleums even 
simple white crosses were ruled out graves will be marked by bronze 
plates set in the ground with nothing above ground except 
landscaping a small chapel in a grove and a communal mausoleum 
gail saunier executive director of the columbia forum a citizen 
watchdog group said she thinks the cemeterys time has come 
it was the one thing we didnt have she said if you feel 
strongly about your community you may want to be buried there i 
think a lot of people do and i think that will increase as columbia 
gets older

a new government publication tries to fix the 
proper name on every species of fish that might end up on an 
americans plate so one diners striped bass will no longer be 
anothers rockfish 
just off the governments presses is the fish list fda guide 
to acceptable market names for food fish sold in interstate 
commerce intended to end the confusion that arises because fishes 
swim under so many aliases 
the book assigns a market name to each fish from sea stream or 
lake that is sold in america and gives the scientificallyacceptable 
common name for each it also tells how the fish is known locally 
often by different names in different places 
fish dealers may sell their wares under either market name or 
common name but none other 
what some people call the boston mackerel and others call the 
common mackerel and still others know as the caballa the booklet 
shows are all one fish with the scientific latin name scomber 
scombrus 
scomber scombrus may be sold simply as mackerel its market name 
or as atlantic mackerel its scienceaccepted common name 
the booklet lists 1042 species all fish sold for food in the 
united states 
but admits fish list compiler mary snyder assistant to the 
director of the division of regulatory guidance at the food and drug 
administration i have missed many i get calls every day about 
fish that arent on the list 
rockfish illustrate the name problem 
people in the midatlantic area call striped bass rockfish 
said mrs snyder 
to the rest of the country the rockfish is a completely 
different fish she said it is related to ocean perch which is 
a rough looking fish squatty and with rough scales and spiny fins 
what we here in the washington area call a rockfish is cigarshaped 
has stripes and is very different 
the government has long required the marketing of fish under 
uniform governmentaccepted names 
whats new is the guidebook it was produced by the fda and the 
commerce departments national marine fisheries service because 
mrs snyder said fish dealers who called for guidance sometimes got 
inconsistent answers 
what the fish list establishes is how species with delicious 
commercial names are sometimes known locally by names so unappealing 
that anyone would be tempted to toss them back 
take the fish known to science as the lethrinus spp its 
commercial name is emperor but it is known in some places as the 
longnosed pigfaced bream elsewhere as the rosefaced pigface bream 
and in yet other places as the mu 
what is sold as the grunt is known in some places as the brown 
sweetlips some people call some anchovies the smig others call the 
grenadier the rattail 
uniform commercial names combat marketplace deception about a 
month ago the government seized 45672 pounds of frozen fish 
fillets imported from new zealand they arrived labeled orange 
roughy a tasty expensive fish when in fact they were merely the 
smooth oreo dory a cheaper fish 
the book lists 24 species of croaker 38 of snapper 18 of eel 
62 of rockfish 31 of grouper 15 of grunt 21 of anchovy 34 of 
shark and 21 of mackerel including the jack mackerel chub 
mackerel king mackerel snake mackerel and the japanese scad inca 
scad or rough scad these scads are mackerels no matter what 
theyre called 
when the consumer buys flounder he may be buying peacock 
flounder one time tropical flounder another time or panther 
flounder bering flounder yellowtail flounder arctic flounder or 
any of 35 other species of flounder 
it doesnt matter said mrs snyder they are so much alike in 
taste and appearance that the customer wouldnt know the difference 
only another flounder could tell one from another

organizers of the first st patricks 
day parade here nine years ago werent sure how popular it would be 
since south dakota is populated mainly by descendants of 
scandinavians and germans 
but good lord they came out of the woodwork says bill 
reynolds who helped plan event back in 1980 organizers had figured 
on maybe 20 parade entries they got more than 350 
thousands of revelers are expected to converge on sioux falls 
again friday to celebrate what has become one of the citys most 
popular holidays 
sylvia henkin chairwoman and owner of ksoo radio inc was 
instrumental in planning the first sioux falls parade 
they called me the jewish leprechaun she recalls 
shes not sure why the idea caught on but she says the bitter 
south dakota winters may have had something to do with it 
i think people sort of have cabin fever in this part of the 
country after being winterized and locked up she said all you 
need is a good excuse to celebrate and my goodness this is a good 
excuse 
this thing has taken off by itself and mushroomed henkin 
said really the only thing we would need to do is blow a whistle 
and it would take off by itself

democrats in congress didnt wait long to call 
president bush on his promise to raise the minimum wage 
democrats who saw their attempt to raise the 335 an hour wage 
floor founder last year have renewed it with greater resolve 
setting up an early confrontation with bush on a domestic issue that 
reaches deep into the wallets of millions of americans 
bush insists he will veto what may become the first piece of 
major legislation to reach his desk if it doesnt match his plan 
despite agreeing that the minimum should be raised for the first 
time in eight years 
425 thats it labor secretary elizabeth dole told a 
senate committee earlier this month drawing a line she says bush 
will not cross 
but democrats are putting their more ambitious increase on the 
fast track using the minimum wage to take the lead on domestic 
legislation after eight years of frustration under president reagan 
were going to get this legislation achieved said sen 
edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and human 
resources committee if its the judgment that bush will veto 
it well override it 
quick action in the house and senate and the concession by 
democrats that a subminimum wage they have long considered poison 
could be part of a compromise has sparked hopes the minimum will 
be raised for the first time since 1981 
an increase in the minimum wage for the nations lowest paid 
employees is long overdue and it is well past time for congress to 
act kennedy said earlier this month 
kennedys committee recently passed his plan to raise the minimum 
to 465 in three annual stages and a house subcommittee approved a 
virtually identical plan on thursday 
the dollar difference is this democrats would take the minimum 
to 385 an hour immediately and then add 40 cents a year for the 
following two years bush would add 30 cents an hour annually for 
three years 
the main political battleground however is over bushs desire 
to add a second tier to leave the minimum at 335 an hour for the 
first six months of employment for all newly hired workers bush 
calls it a training wage although opponents deride the term 
because there are no requirements for any training 
kennedy long opposed to a second scale said last week hed be 
glad to listen to a limited version 
but he added im not going to see the corruption of the 
minimum wage by using the words training wage to throw older 
workers out of work and displace those who want to work 40 hours a 
week 
rep austin murphy dpa chairman of the house labor standards 
subcommittee said he was drawing up his own version of the reduced 
wage as an alternative to the republican plan and may introduce it 
on the house floor an aide said murphy is looking at a duration of 
30 to 90 days for a subminimum and would likely tie it to a 
percentage of the standard minimum 
labor department figures show slightly fewer than 4 million 
people work for the minimum wage about 15 percent of them heads of 
households some 11 million others earn less than 455 an hour 
according to a report on the raise that failed last year and so 
could see fatter paychecks if the minimum is boosted 
the last time the rate was raised was in 1978 when it was 
boosted in four stages that ended with the 335 an hour standard in 
1981 
inflation has eroded the current minimum by 38 percent 
kennedy said the administrations plan would eventually raise the 
minimum by 268 percent while democrats want a 39 percent hike 
bush puts the argument in terms of jobs saying 650000 people 
would be thrown out of work if the minimum is raised to 465 mrs 
dole said the raise to 425 would cost 450000 jobs but other 
provisions would make up part of that loss 
however rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house 
education and labor committee noted that since it was established 
in 1938 each time the minimum wage increased employment also 
increased with the two recession years the sole exception 
frustrated by watching social programs suffer during reagans 
administration democrats are keying their minimum wage plans to the 
hope that bush wont use his veto power 
i take it seriously but not very sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio a member of the labor committee said of the threat ive 
been around long enough to know that when a president threatens a 
veto sometimes it means he will veto and sometimes it means the 
beginning of the negotiating process

four roman catholic parishes may start a 
pilot project to encourage sacrificial giving similar to the 
practice of tithing because parishioners arent giving enough to 
allow church employees to get raises a church official said 
bishop louis e gelineau and the dioceses council of priests are 
considering a proposal to encourage a sacrificial giving program 
in four parishes that would be modeled on the tithing practice said 
the rev william j mccaffrey vicar for planning and finance of the 
diocese of providence 
the average parishioner puts roughly 11 percent of his or her 
takehome pay in the collection plate mccaffrey said saturday at a 
daylong conference for religious education teachers 
as a result the diocese has been unable to raise salaries for 
parochial school teachers and other workers to keep up with public 
school salaries in the past three years he said 
some protestant denominations practice tithing which requires 
congregants to give up to 10 percent of their incomes to the church

all the budget talk now going on wont shrink 
the deficit much unless white house and congressional leaders 
conquer a pervasive feeling that its politically best to let the 
problem slide until next year 
the smarter strategy would be to take the strong steps now 
said rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee but im not kidding myself right now the votes are not 
there for that kind of package 
fiscal policy experts agree its better to reduce the deficit 
while the economy is strong government statistics last week showed 
unemployment at a 15year low and other signs are positive 
a new round of negotiations on the fiscal 1990 budget with white 
house budget director richard darman treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and senior members of the house and senate budget committees 
began thursday and will resume tuesday 
there is still a great deal of hope and were working 
together said sen pete v domenici of new mexico senior 
republican on the senate budget committee 
but the politicians have proven themselves unable to act without 
some kind of calamity that creates public pressure such as the 1987 
stock market crash that forced a modest twoyear budget agreement 
between president reagan and congress 
no such crisis now exists 
people dont see the greater evil lying out there from 
inaction said robert reischauer director of the nonpartisan 
congressional budget office the budget negotiators dont have any 
outside pressure either from the american people or the economy to 
bolster up their backbone 
reischauer who became cbo director two weeks ago agrees with 
the many economists who believe the deficit probably wont cause an 
immediately perceptible crisis as it gradually gnaws away at 
americas economic strength 
in an abstract sense the vast majority of the american people 
think something should be done he said but unless theres a 
crisis such as a wall street crash or runaway inflation they are 
not willing to admit that they or their programs should be a part of 
the solution 
theres a key element missing from the budget debate and 
thats a reason to act said stan collender a former staffer on 
the house and senate budget committees who now monitors federal 
economic policy for the firm of price waterhouse 
the grammrudman law was designed to create artificial crisis and 
force action using the threat of acrosstheboard spending cuts if 
congress and the president failed to meet preset deficit limits 
but those ceilings depend on white house forecasts for the 
economy and government spending and critics say president bushs 
fiscal 1990 budget falls back on president reagans habit of 
manipulating those forecasts to minimize tough budget choices 
for example bushs plan to bail out the savings and loan 
industry was created to be offbudget tens of billions of 
dollars of costs thus do not show up on the balance sheets and the 
administration can claim it is meeting the grammrudman goal of a 
deficit no larger than 100 billion in the new fiscal year 
spending saves money up is down black is white this is an 
alltime low water mark in terms of kidding ourselves said carol 
cox head of the committee for a responsible federal budget who 
also cited the bush budget reliance on projections of sharply lower 
interest rates at the same time rates are going up 
with bush unwilling to confront the deficit headon all of the 
incentives are for congress to buy additional smoke and mirrors to 
avoid unpopular spending cuts or challenging bush to a tax increase 
she said 
i fearlessly predict the deficit next year wont be much lower 
than this year she said 
the deficit has actually gone up in the last two years despite 
muchballyhooed plans that were supposed to reduce it the 
government now expects red ink to exceed 170 billion this fiscal 
year although grammrudman called for 136 billion 
further hindering bold moves this year especially from the 
democraticcontrolled congress is political distrust 
darman told reporters last week he has assured democrats the 
white house would step forward and share blame for unpopular parts 
in a budget package but there is widespread doubt among the 
opposition party that bush would control such partisans as 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater and ed rollins 
who heads the house republican campaign office 
and republicans in the senate remember taking a gutsy stand to 
reduce the deficit in 1985 with a plan that included cutting back 
social security costofliving adjustments democrats hammered them 
with that vote and wrested away control of the senate 
i think after five years of almost continuous budget warfare 
that has torn apart the congress this has become awfully 
fruitless ground to plow said steve bell staff chief of the 
senate budget committee when the republicans were in control 
by relying on the rosy assumptions congress and the president 
need to restrain spending growth or raise revenues by only about 13 
billion out of a 116 trillion spending plan in order to avoid the 
grammrudman automatic cuts 
bell now with salomon brothers predicts a slidethrough 
glide through budget resolution 
the participants in the talks wont say that themselves but sen 
jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee said 
last week that darman and the white house were privately seeking a 
minimalist approach sasser also said that darman said privately 
that he might look at a tax increase next year 
darman denied it but many on capitol hill say bushs budget 
which carefully avoided spelling out billions of dollars in spending 
cuts made clear that the white house was no more willing to tackle 
the deficit than congress 
we ought to get rid of this budget year as quickly as we can 
because then maybe next year we can really get serious said 
rep david obey dwis a member of the house appropriations 
committee

an iranian newspaper sunday blamed the fbi 
for the bombing of a us navy captains van and said washington 
tried to implicate iran in the attack to justify deportation of 
iranian students 
the englishlanguage newspaper kayhan international linked the 
alleged us plot to western anger at ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
order that novelist salman rushdie be killed for his new novel 
the satanic verses 
us officials said saturday the bombing of the van driven by 
the wife of the navy man who mistakenly ordered the destruction of 
an iranian passenger jet was being investigated as a possible 
terrorist attack 
the bombing will not be the last attempt to implicate iran 
over the rushdie controversy kayhan international said in an 
editorial summarized by irans official islamic republic news agency 
the newspaper noted that one day before fridays bombing in san 
diego a us senate hearing was held at which an fbi official said 
thousands of zealous iranian students in the united states pose 
a great threat to americans 
therefore the editorial said iran was not surprised when the 
federal bureau of investigation said that it was investigating 
possible iranian involvement in the bombing 
in washington fbi spokeswoman kathy kennedy denied the 
allegation and added we have never made any linkage to iran since 
this incident happened 
we havent gotten to the point in the investigation where we 
could make such a linkage she said 
irna quoted the newspaper as saying the explosion was designed 
to create the necessary climate in the united states that would 
justify the expulsion of iranians 
no one was injured in the blast that destroyed a van driven by 
sharon rogers the wife of navy capt will rogers iii mrs rogers 
got out of the van when she heard a noise witnesses described as 
two loud pops the van exploded and burned moments later 
as commander of the guidedmissile cruiser uss vincennes rogers 
ordered the destruction of what he thought was an iranian f14 jet 
fighter july 3 after the craft failed to respond to warnings in the 
persian gulf 
the aircraft was actually an iranian civilian jet and all 290 
people aboard were killed 
rogers later said he acted to protect his ship and crew he was 
backed by the reagan administration which also decided to 
compensate the victims families 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani has alleged that 
western governments may carry out terrorist attacks and link them to 
iran in retaliation for khomeinis death order against rushdie 
which was issued feb 14 
many moslems believe the satanic verses blasphemes islam and 
iranian clerymen have put a 52 million bounty on rushdies head 
the author a british citizen who was born into a moslem family has 
been in hiding since feb 14 
at thursdays hearing in washington an fbi official said about 
15000 zealous iranian students are in the united states and 
might try to seek revenge against rushdie supporters 
oliver buck revell told a senate subcommittee looking into 
the impact of khomeinis death order that the students are 
particularly dangerous because they cannot be monitored and because 
the state departments standards for issuing visas are lax 
 
the controversy over the death sentence led iran to break 
diplomatic ties with britain on tuesday britain in turn announced 
it was expelling up to 30 iranians 
irna quoted interior minister ali akbar mohtashami as also 
calling for an economic embargo of british goods 
if we boycott britain economically we will strike the heaviest 
blow on this old colonialist country and supporter of infidelity 
he said sunday

she once sang of broken hearts and lonely 
nights to boozy lounge lizards but rory zuckermans singing career 
really took off when she switched to children and the joys of eating 
broccoli or splashing in a bubble bath 
known simply as rory zuckerman is too much of a mouthful for 
kids she says the 33yearold mother from suburban bethesda 
md is playing to growing audiences of youngsters and their parents 
with her toetapping fingersnapping tunes and gentle ballads many 
inspired by her sons daniel 5 and max 16 months 
she and guitaristarranger tom guernsey have produced their first 
album im just a kid containing 10 songs that blend jazz 
blues broadway show tunes motown pop and 50s doowop in a musical 
style that rory calls kidrock 
sales figures since the album was released last august on her 
roar music label suggest that its a big hit among kids caught in 
the musical no mans land between cutesy nursery rhymes and mtvs 
teenoriented heavy metal their babyboomer parents seem to like 
it too 
her national distributor alcazar productions of waterbury vt 
says more than 3000 albums were sold in the first three months 
already the fastestselling debut by a childrens singer sales 
mostly in book and toy stores could top 200000 in the first year 
rorys concert dates have taken her from vermont to little rock 
ark and theyre accelerating she expects eventually to perform 50 
to 75 outoftown engagements annually 
she and guernsey just completed their second childrens album and 
will start work soon on a third theyre making plans to produce a 
fulllength music video rory has appeared on nbctvs today and 
several other network shows and is a regular guest on radio talk 
shows 
its all a far cry from the seven years when rory sang top 40 
hits at nightclubs shopping malls high school proms and and motel 
lounges and recorded radio jingles for fastfood restaurants and 
local auto dealerships 
she played in some real dives she recalls like bowling banquets 
in american legion halls and joints where bouncers had to take 
customers outside she said once she dutifully sang requests all 
evening for a drunk who threw up on her before he passed out 
worse her career was going nowhere fast 
after her marriage to washington builder shelton zuckerman in 
1981 and the birth of daniel rory listened to childrens music for 
hours 
i heard a lot of nice sounds a lot of folk and nursery rhymes 
but nothing that was terribly creative she said in an interview 
between studio recording sessions 
a lot of people assume that kids music should be very quiet 
and very sweet and dull she said but she learned from daniel 
that kids are much more sophisticated that we give them credit 
for and they can pick up the lyrics and rhythm of a song much 
faster than adults do 
rory and guernsey who has teenage children and also was reared 
on the 60s sounds of the beatles the beach boys and the doobie 
brothers started composing their own stuff about two years ago to 
try to fill the gap 
the infectious rubadub rhythm of bubble bath is a favorite 
of her toddler max the incredible piglets stage puppets created by 
a jim hensen designer echo motowns supremes as they extoll the 
delights of broccoli squash and even rutabaga eating veggies is 
our thing they squeal 
from a clash between rory and daniel stuck at home and bored on 
a rainy afternoon came the lyrics to another song you youre 
drivin me crazy even though im crazy for you that examines 
family frictions through the eyes of both parent and child 
she and guernsey arent preachy moralists rory said but if they 
have a message its to urge parents to lighten up and not take 
everything so seriously 
quit putting flash cards in the crib quit pushing your kids to 
be rocket scientists at age 3 she said let them have fun and 
be innocent as long as they can and dont forget to be a kid when 
youre an adult

a ninemember congressional commission recently 
recommended a 50 percent pay raises for judges government officials 
and lawmakers nobody got a penny of it 
a 14member commission created by congress labored for a year on 
ways to reduce the federal deficit it ended hopelessly deadlocked 
now an eightmember commission appointed by president bush to 
come up with ethical standards applying equally to all three 
branches of government has reported that it cant be done 
the ethics panel report released friday is one more bit of 
evidence that sometimes the commissions government creates to help 
with its problems produce more rhetoric than results 
as a mayor or a governor or a president or a legislative body 
that is being criticized for something looks for something to do 
one of the easiest things to do is to study the matter to create a 
commission said donald rumsfeld a former secretary of defense 
and a member of the deficit reduction panel 
some serve a useful purpose some dont he added 
as rumsfeld noted washington has no monopoly on the idea of a 
study panel 
joe pisciotte a professor of government at wichita state 
university in kansas studied commissions created by the city of 
wichita 
the term i would use for some of them is the politics of 
avoidance that if the governing body doesnt want to deal with a 
particularly sensitive problem itself it will create a board or 
commission or task force and pass the heat so to speak pisciotte 
said 
although pisciotte studied the phenomenon in his own back yard 
he thinks his conclusions also would apply to many federal 
commissions 
i think the pay commission was a prime example that was too 
politically sensitive too politically difficult so the people 
who were ultimately responsible for that passed the heat he said 
as to why some commissions produce more results than others 
experts say there is no single answer 
one of the most successful commissions in recent years was the 
15member national commission on social security reform created by 
president reagan in 1981 which prepared the blueprint for a social 
security rescue bill that barreled through congress in a matter of 
weeks 
contrasting this with the national economic commission that made 
the deficit study rumsfeld said the difference was that the 
environment for a compromise solution on social security was 
hospitable they really felt that they needed some mechanism to come 
together with a compromise package 
the national economic commission on the other hand was created 
by congress in the wake of the october 1987 stock market crash amid 
considerable speculation that it would recommend some kind of tax 
increase by the time it wound up its work the market had rebounded 
and george bush who had criticized the panel during the campaign 
and vowed to continue reagans opposition to any tax hike was 
president 
the only reason that thing was appointed was that you had 
president reagan who talked a great game and did some wonderful 
things for the country but added a trillion dollars of debt because 
he basically was a compromiser and he didnt want to use the veto 
said one republican who has served on a number of government 
commissions he spoke on the understanding his name not be used 
kenneth janda a professor of political science at northwestern 
university said he believes a legal requirement that the 
commissions meetings be public added to its difficulties 
to the extent that partisanship is a major variable i think 
that open hearings become a real problem because if you make any 
kind of tactical concession it can be interpreted by your rivals 
within the party as giving away something janda said 
however william agee of boise idaho president of the giant 
morrisonknudsen heavy construction firm who served on the equally 
politically charged and equally open pay commission said i 
personally believe that open meetings are ok i think they serve a 
useful purpose 
the commission on executive legislative and judicial salaries 
which came up with the 50 percent pay hike that lawmakers turned 
down in the face of a public uproar was created by congress in 
1967 it is commonly called the quadrennial commission because it 
makes its recommendations every four years 
in 1981 the commission recommended a 22 percent pay hike and 
outgoing president carter approved it reagan had given his 
unofficial approval before taking office but later changed his mind 
and withdrew his ok in 1985 the commissions recommendations did 
result in a raise bringing congressional salaries to 75100 a year 
members of the current commission still defend their 
recommendations although preston r tisch a former postmaster 
general conceded that maybe the 50 percent was a little high 
we thought the administration was going to massage it a little 
which they didnt tisch said that was a calculation on our 
part 
under the law the president can disapprove a recommended 
increase or approve it either in whole or in part reagan still in 
office when the commission made its report approved it in full 
the ethics panel was launched by bush in january with 
instructions to come up with standards equitable across all three 
branches of the federal government 
it decided however that the basic law that prevents executive 
officials from taking government actions affecting their financial 
interests could not be applied to members of congress for 
constitutional and other reasons 
in addition it was unable to decide what categories of work 
should be exempt from limits on outside earnings so the panel 
recommended that such determinations be left up to the president 
rep barney frank dmass chief architect of an ethics bill vetoed 
by reagan last year denounced this as just a terrible idea 
r james woolsey former counsel of the senate armed services 
committee and a member of the ethics panel said the current 
commission had to work very quickly because we were asked to get the 
job done essentially in a month and i think given that deadline 
did a rather strikingly complete job

the pentagons implementation of financial 
management reforms called for in a twoyear law reorganizing the 
defense department has been inadequate according to a report 
released sunday 
the general accounting office congress investigative arm found 
that although the army has consolidated its financial management 
structure the navy has made few changes and the air force violated 
the law 
the goldwaternichols department of defense reorganization act of 
1986 required that the military departments designate a single 
office within their civilian secretariats to conduct financial 
management which includes budgeting accounting cash management 
financial reporting internal control and review 
offices within the military department secretariats and 
military headquarters that parallel or duplicate these functions are 
to be merged into a solitary office located within the civilian 
secretariat said rep j larry hopkins of kentucky ranking 
republican on the house armed services investigations subcommittee 
the gao study determined whether the departments reorganizations 
satisfied the law and what effects the streamlining had on civilian 
control 
although the army has met the laws requirements questions 
over navy compliance remain and the air force though complying in 
principle violated the spirit of the law said rep nicholas 
mavroules dmass chairman of the house subcommittee 
the army according to the report merged the office of the 
comptroller into the office of the assistant secretary for financial 
management the authority of the civilian assistant secretary was 
enhanced and the staff increased from 29 to about 220 
the gao found significant reliance on dualhatting in the 
navy and also discovered that the marine corps fiscal management 
division handled financial management the division reports to the 
commandant thus violating the laws requirment that financial 
management be handled by a civilian secretariat 
at the air force the responsibility of financial management was 
consolidated within the secretariat but at the same time the 
position of civilian assistant secretary was eliminated and the job 
of military comptroller was established the comptroller was then 
transferred from the secretariat to the air staff 
the air force turned the law on its head hopkins said 
instead of strengthening civilian control it bent the law by 
giving authority for financial management to a threestar general 
the defense department in response to the report noted that the 
secretary of the air force has more direct control over financial 
management than ever before 
the reorganization act was named after its chief sponsors former 
sen barry goldwater rariz and the late rep bill nichols dala

new york state introduced the electric chair 
to the world in 1890 and may be on the verge of commemorating the 
centennial by putting it back into use after more than 25 years 
without legal executions 
even the white house is interested said state sen dale 
volker an upstate republican who is chief sponsor of new yorks 
death penalty legislation in the senate 
last week after more than five hours of emotional debate the 
democratcontrolled assembly approved a death penalty bill 9748 
of the five legislators who did not vote two have voted for the 
death penalty in the past and the other three have voted against it 
that means the 150member assembly is within one vote of being 
able to override a certain veto by gov mario cuomo which requires 
a twothirds vote in each house that is 100 votes in the assembly 
i think one of them will blink predicted vincent graber 
chief sponsor of the bill in the assembly of the 51 opponents 
the republicancontrolled state senate has voted to override 
cuomos vetoes of the death penalty since 1985 and is expected to do 
so again this year 
cuomo whose vetoes have stood for each of the past six years 
has vowed to make my case over and over again against the death 
penalty in the next few months before cuomo democratic gov hugh 
carey delivered six years of vetoes 
but cuomo acknowledged its a difficult message people are 
angry and disgusted 
the violence brought by new york citys crack epidemic has 
greatly increased public outcry for a death penalty in the state 
the nations largest without capital punishment on the books 
there were 1586 murders in the city last year through oct 31 
compared with 1691 in all of 1987 statewide graber said during 
the assembly debate there were 2225 murders last year up more 
than 10 percent from 1987 
two weeks ago a federal drug agent was gunned down in new york 
city 
and three men are on trial for the murder last year of police 
officer edward byrne who was guarding the house of a witness in a 
drug case prosecutors say the hit was ordered by a jailed drug 
kingpin 
during last years presidential campaign byrnes father gave his 
sons badge to prodeath penalty republican george bush 
such carnage plus a poll showing 73 percent of his constituents 
favored the death penalty prompted one longtime assembly opponent 
edward abramson to switch his vote last week his represents a 
district in queens the new york city borough where byrne was killed 
new york is one of 13 states without an operative death penalty 
statute of the 37 with death penalty laws only 13 have held 
executions since the us supreme court cleared the way for them to 
resume in 1976 most of the others may have death sentences pending 
on appeal 
the bill being considered in new york would allow the death 
penalty to be used against several types of murderers including 
contract killers and those who murder a police officer 
new yorks electric chair was last used on aug 15 1963 when 
eddie lee mays convicted of a 1961 bar shooting became the 695th 
person to die in it 
volker said hes been getting calls from all over the nation 
about the new york situation he said the white house asked the 
state senates washington office for information about the assembly 
vote 
legislators say they can already feel pressure building 
ive already gotten calls from two police officers and a 
detective assemblyman vito lopez a brooklyn democrat who opposes 
the death penalty said the day after last weeks vote 
the next few weeks will be very rough said lopez people 
have talked about this being the time to take a vacation or move 
away 
lopez said he expects to vote again against the death penalty 
but he doesnt flatly rule out a change of heart 
if my district substantially lobbied me in favor of the death 
penalty bill then i would have to look at it he said

everglades game fish are suddenly showing mercury 
levels among the highest ever recorded in the united states 
alarming experts who are searching for a cause 
last week floridas department of health and rehabilitative 
services issued health warnings against eating largemouth bass and 
warmouth caught in western parts of palm beach broward and dade 
counties 
fish samples contained up to 44 parts per million more than 
four times the amount of methyl mercury that the federal government 
considers safe 
the everglades mercury is attracting attention because the 
precious environment there is already reeling 
thats one of the highest concentrations ever recorded in the 
country said frank ditri a michigan state university expert on 
mercury to find concentration up to 5 or 6 parts per million in 
fish he said he had to go back to 1970 and that was in a lake 
contaminated by hundreds of pounds of mercury from a factory 
new tests have been ordered all over southeastern florida in the 
wake of the unexpected findings 
scientists are puzzled by the discovery of methyl mercury in the 
everglades while the poisonous metal has been found frequently in 
the heavily industrialized northeast it hasnt been found much in 
floridas rural swampland 
mercury which is especially dangerous to an unborn fetus can 
cause central nervous system damage that leads to deafness 
numbness reduced vision loss of coordination and trembling eating 
enough everglades fish to cause such damage would take months but 
over a long enough time poisoning would show its effects 
there are many theories on how the metal entered the environment 
according to scientists 
winds from other regions could have blown mercuryladen factory 
smoke from as far away as mexico into southern florida or midnight 
dumpers could have thrown residue from some electronic manufacturer 
secretly into the everglades another theory holds that fire 
drought and rain could combine to leech the heavy metal from 
naturally occurring deposits in the soil 
some scientists lean toward a theory that the contaminant has 
lain in the muck at the bottom of the everglades since before 
mercury was banned from pesticides two decades ago 
this may have been something that has been down here for 20 
years or so said university of miami epidemiologist dr thomas 
briggle it has been that long since there was a legal fungicide 
using mercury 
the likely sources would have been the sugarcane fields that dot 
the area 
briggle speculates that the recent drought and water shortages 
have forced the water district to move water around inside the 
everglades disturbing the mercuryladen muck at the bottom of 
canals 
once the mercury was back in the water it entered the food chain 
and was concentrated in the bass and warmouth predators at the top 
burkett neely director of the loxahatchee national wildlife 
refuge has doubts about the old fungicide theory however he notes 
the pattern of the findings none have been found north of the 
agricultural areas in lake okeechobee suggest the contamination 
began more recently at a specific point or points 
in addition while the drought is serious other years have been 
as bad yet as recently as three years ago fish samples showed far 
lower mercury levels 
we had some kind of event in the last three years that has put 
a lot of mercury into the system neely said something happened 
at the north end of the everglades and traveled south 
contamination from agriculture is one possibility another he 
said is the illegal dumping by someone using nearby us highway 
27 theres no telling whats in those canals neely said 
although the fish show no ill effects and people have now been 
warned against eating them there still may be victims said dan 
dunford director of the everglades office of the florida game and 
fresh water fish commission 
several animals including otters raccoons and such endangered 
species as everglades mink wood storks and snail kites could be at 
risk from mercury in the fish they eat or in other prey

christian army troops and syrianbacked 
druse militiamen battled fiercely sunday in hills above beirut a 
day after authorities shut down lebanons only international airport 
a police spokesman said the clashes erupted in the evening in and 
around the strategic hilltop town of souk elgharb the violence 
broke a ceasefire called at midnight saturday to halt the worst 
fighting around the capital in two years 
there was no immediate word on casualties from sundays artillery 
and rocket duels between christian units and militiamen of druse 
warlord walid jumblatt 
six people have been killed and 32 wounded since clashes broke 
out wednesday 
on saturday after druse militiamen shelled the citys port and 
the defense ministry compound the christian cabinet ordered 
beiruts airport closed saying it was unsafe 
the order came as a rebuff to jumblatt the public works and 
tourism minister in the rival moslem cabinet he had vowed to keep 
the airport operating 
in retaliation the moslem cabinet moved sunday to block sea 
traffic to christiancontrolled harbors 
because of escalating hostilities maritime traffic to the 
beirut port and the port of jounieh is henceforth declared unsafe 
said a statement issued by the moslem administration 
there was no immediate indication of what measures were planned 
to blockade the ports the moslems have no naval force but could 
launch longrange artillery attacks on jounieh which is 12 miles 
north of beirut and the main port in the christian heartland 
directors of middle east airlines the state carrier suspended 
flights indefinitely after a fivehour meeting sunday at the beirut 
airport 
hundreds of mostly lebanese passengers crowded the airport 
departure lounge then returned to the city when the suspension was 
announced 
an airport official who requested anonymity said staff were still 
reporting for duty because they did not know how long the airport 
would be closed its a daybyday affair he said 
bulgarias balkan airlines canceled its scheduled flight to 
beirut the only regular sunday international flight to the city 
the official said 
syrian soviet and czechoslovakian carriers are the only other 
foreign airlines that regularly use the airport 
most of sundays fighting focused on souk elgharb a mountain 
peak 15 miles southeast of beirut that commands a network of roads 
leading from druseheld territory to lebanons christian section 
police said thousands of people huddled in basements and bomb 
shelters all saturday night as the battling troops shelled beirut 
suburbs and 21 residential districts on both sides of the front 
lines in lebanons central mountain range the fighting has 
imperiled efforts by an arab league foreign ministers committee to 
resolve a crisis that threatens the country with permanent partition 
into sectarian cantons 
the crisis erupted when president amin gemayels sixyear term 
expired sept 22 and parliament was unable to elect a successor 
gemayel named the army chief gen michel aoun a maronite 
catholic to lead an interim military cabinet moslems and leftists 
rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to salim hoss a 
sunni moslem who governed under gemayel

palestinian leaders denounced on sunday new 
proposals reportedly planned by the bush administration for easing 
tension in the israelioccupied territories 
the palestinians attending a mideast peace symposium in new 
york called on the administration to push instead for a permanent 
solution to the arabisraeli conflict including creation of an 
independent palestinian state 
several leftwing israeli legislators attending the threeday 
symposium which began saturday also predicted that the us 
initiatives described in a published report sunday would fail if 
they included only interim measures for quelling the palestinian 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that the bush 
administration plans to propose that both israel and the palestine 
liberation organization take steps to ease tension in the 
israelioccupied territories 
us officials plan to ask israel to release some of the 
palestinians arrested during the 15month uprising end or limit 
detentions and reopen schools in the territories the newspaper 
said quoting an unidentified senior administration official 
the us initiatives also would call on the plo to halt violent 
demonstrations in the israelioccupied territories block 
antiisraeli raids from southern lebanon and stop distribution of 
inflammatory leaflets the newspaper said 
these demands are unbalanced unfair said faisal husseini 
director of the arab studies center in east jerusalem and a top 
palestinian leader in the occupied territories 
he said the new us proposals were flawed because they are 
asking us to stop the demonstrations while israel was being asked 
the minimum 
husseini and plo officials at the symposium said the real issue 
is ending israels occupation of the territories captured from 
jordan and egypt during the 1967 middle east war and creating a 
palestinian state 
the intefadeh the arabic name for the uprising is our only 
weapon for continuing the peace plan said nabil shaath chairman 
of the political committee of the palestine national council the 
plos legislative arm what is not negotiable is the final result 
an independent palestinian state sidebyside with the state of 
israel 
afif safieh the plo representative in the netherlands said the 
reported new us proposals were aimed at the wrong target 
the target should not be how to decrease the level of tensions 
but how to practice manage and plan the solution to the conflict 
he said 
yossi sarid a member of the leftwing citizens rights movement 
in israels knesset or parliament said the bush proposals show 
at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency about 
restarting the mideast peace process 
but he said if the administration plans only an interim 
agreement without addressing the final status between israel and 
the plo the proposals will fail 
yair tzaban a knesset member from the socialist mapam party 
said the proposals were incomplete 
plo chairman yasser arafat is like the man riding a bicycle 
he said he can go either forward or backward but he cannot stand 
still because he will fall down so we must push the peace process 
forward 
the new bush proposals will be presented monday when israeli 
foreign minister moshe arens meets with the president the times 
reported while the suggestions for the plo will be presented 
through the american ambassador in tunis robert pelletreau jr 
the threeday symposium at columbia university is the first to be 
sponsored by israelis and palestinians in cooperation with us jews 
and arabs

striking eastern airlines employees have the 
psychological benefit of venting their feeling while picketing but 
nonunion workers who found themselves out of work overnight will 
have a tougher time adjusting psychologists say 
mitchell lee marks an organizational psychologist who helps 
major companies through mergers and cutbacks said he has been 
impressed by the commitment of easterns unions to the 60yearold 
carrier 
eastern means something to them said marks a consultant in 
the los angeles office of mercer meidinger hansen i am impressed 
by the extent in which people want to buy into their company 
psychologically 
the unions tactic of focusing attention on frank lorenzo 
chairman of easterns parent texas air corp as the bad guy in the 
strike that virtually grounded the miamibased airline is beneficial 
for the employees he said 
whats fascinating about this case is it really comes down to 
a personality battle you dont hear people talking about the 
economics of the situation he said thats part of the reason 
theyre rebelling against lorenzo and not eastern its this raider 
lorenzo who would come in and try to break them 
but all eastern employees must face the changes that in less than 
a week landed the nations seventhlargest airline in bankruptcy 
court 
you lose all sense of control said robert ziller a 
university of florida psychology professor but in a way theyre 
sustained by the fact they have a common opponent lorenzo people 
have been known to endure five years of bombing under those 
circumstances 
since many eastern employees have long service with the carrier 
they have to make almost a midlife midcareer transition which is 
very very difficult said douglas m mccabe an associate 
professor of labor relations at the georgetown university school of 
business 
an employees standard of living gets cut drastically and 
theyre eating hot dogs youre going from a very high standard 
of living to one thats very low he said 
about 9500 of the companys nonunion workers ended up in the 
worst psychological position of all when they were laid off without 
notice last week but some experts believe they will have an easier 
time finding work because they have more flexible skills than the 
pilots machinists and flight attendants trained for a single job 
marks suggested group discussion sessions for nonunion workers 
to vent their feelings an avenue union members have at the union 
hall and on picket lines 
eastern workers will go through stages of denial expecting the 
strike to be over soon to anger against lorenzo and the strikers 
to planning strategy about staying with eastern and job hunting to 
acceptance and youve got to go through those stages marks 
said 
mccabe expects a transition time of six months to a year while 
people find new jobs 
he and marks likened the strike to recent mergers and corporate 
cutbacks because of the similar labor adjustments 
if you have a massive downsizing youre truly changing the 
organization it cannot not change said marks who acted as a 
consultant as delta air lines absorbed western airlines in 1987 and 
helped with the creation of the unisys corporation 
theres a myth that some managers hold that the people will 
be grateful that they survived he said but thats the farthest 
from the truth because theyre waiting for the other shoe to 
drop 
marks believes corporations have responsibility to help their 
employees to adjust and employees need to take greater control of 
their lives 
the lesson to be learned for all employees is youve got to be 
more responsible to be more alert to what changes will come down 
the pike he said the lesson to be learned by employers is to 
send a message that their people matter

president pw botha denied 
sunday that he is involved in a power struggle with his heir 
apparent and he said he is ready to resume work following a stroke 
in his first televised remarks since his jan 18 stroke the 
73yearold afrikaner said he has a constitutional duty to continue 
in office 
he made no reference to calls for him to step down when he spoke 
in a 15minute prerecorded interview on state television networks 
evening news show 
two weeks after his jan 18 stroke botha resigned as leader of 
the national party and was succeeded by education minister fw de 
klerk 52 
de klerk and other senior nationalist leaders met botha last week 
amid reports a solid majority of the partys parliamentary caucus 
wants botha to retire promptly or cede a significant share of power 
to de klerk more talks are expected this week 
botha who showed no signs of illhealth during the interview 
said de klerk was being misused by some people but insisted 
there is no personal conflict 
that would be a terrible charge against he and i said botha 
noting he appointed de klerk to key parliamentary posts in past 
years 
why because i have faith in him botha said 
he indicated he was displeased with suggestions a de klerk 
presidency would herald a new era of political reform 
i originated the concept of reform botha said 
mr de klerk has always shared these sentiments with me he 
added there are forces in this country seeking to exploit an 
unfortunate situation to sow political confusion 
botha said even before his stroke he advocated steps to lighten 
the presidential workload but he gave no hint when he might retire 
from the post he has held since 1978 he said it was too early to 
say when he might call a general election which must be held within 
12 months 
i am healthy now botha said i want to talk to fellow 
cabinet members i want to talk to leaders of other population 
groups on south africas future 
im not looking for power for the sake of power im open to 
advice he said 
near the end of his interview he summed up his basic message 
stay calm were living in dangerous times in difficult times 
the bothade klerk confrontation was frontpage news in all major 
newspapers sunday 
botha the defiant said a banner headline in the sunday 
times the countrys largestselling newspaper 
pw stands alone said the sunday star 
mr bothas attitude is quite irrational said a star 
editorial the real interests of this country are certainly 
more crucial than the quirks of a fading strong man reluctant to let 
go of power

cafeterias at the nations secondlargest 
school district will stop serving apples to students this week in 
response to a report finding a cancer risk to children from a 
chemical residue on some fruit 
the ban also includes any apple products including juice pies 
and applesauce said los angeles unified school district officials 
the districts 592000 students have eaten more than 5 million 
apples each year second only to the new york city school system 
where students consumed 13 million apples new york schools enacted 
a similar ban last week 
thats a lot of apples so we decided to do it in order to 
protect the health and safety of students said los angeles 
district spokeswoman eva hain 
the bans in los angeles and new york followed a feb 28 report by 
the washingtonbased national resources defense council which said 
the chemical daminozide could increase the incidence of cancer in 
children 
daminozide sold under the brand name alar is sprayed on apple 
trees in the spring and acts to keep apples on the tree longer that 
makes harvesting easier improves the apples color and firmness 
and extends their shelf life 
alar permeates the fruits skin and cannot be peeled off or 
washed away 
apple growers have criticized the report contending that only 4 
percent of the apples sold in the united states show any traces of 
alar and that those traces fall well below federal environmental 
protection agency levels 
its very disturbing that los angeles would arbitrarily make a 
decision to ban apples based on the results of one report in which 
the facts are not right said derl i derr president of the 
virginiabased international apple institute a trade organization 
for the 12 billionayear industry 
an apple a day is still healthy advice derr said 
the federal epa has moved to ban alar eventually but has said it 
disagrees with the environmental groups contention that the risk 
from using it is so great that an immediate ban is needed 
the california department of food and agriculture also criticized 
the groups study 
the los angeles school district will not serve apples or apple 
products until it conducts its own laboratory tests said randy 
altenberg deputy director of food services for the district 
we are taking a cautious approach to a problem that could 
affect the health of our schoolchildren he said

measure for measure the darkest of 
shakespeares comedies deals with sexual hypocrisy political 
intrigue and urban lawlessness 
in other words a perfect play for our times a fact reinforced 
by the clear concise moderndress production that opened last week 
at the mitzi newhouse theater in lincoln center 
the director is mark lamos artistic head of the hartford stage 
company lamos built his regional theater reputation in connecticut 
on a series of dazzling interpretations of shakespeare including a 
debonair 1930ish twelfth night a surrealistic and 
phantasmagorical pericles and a lavish hamlet starring 
richard thomas the latter looked like a series of staged photo 
opportunities for the evening news 
his measure for measure is more austere almost antiseptic in 
design and execution designer john conklins minimalist environment 
consists of a white graffiticovered wall a naked light bulb 
hanging over the stage and a few pieces of what looks like 
secondhand office furniture 
a sense of dislocation prevails although the setting is vienna 
it could be anywhere an actor reads a germanlanguage newspaper 
but the graffiti on the wall is in english the costumes also by 
conklin are a mixture of madison avenue conservative and soho chic 
for a comedy measure for measure mostly stays somber until 
the end of the evening until then audiences have to deal with the 
machinations of the duke who leaves his kingdom in the hands of 
angelo a selfrighteous bureaucrat 
when angelo orders claudio to be executed for his sexual 
escapades he doesnt realize he will fall in love with the 
condemned mans sister isabella angelo offers a reprieve in 
exchange for sexual favors from the woman it takes the duke 
disguised as a friar quite a while to straighten out the mess 
len carious paternal portrayal of the duke is fine but his 
speaking voice is odd slow and measured as if he were reciting a 
foreign language lesson campbell scott looking like a young eager 
wall street lawyer projects the coldness of the ambitious angelo as 
well as his frantic desire when the man realizes that he wants 
isabella bradley whitford projects the passion of a young man 
afraid to die 
a sweetfaced kate burton makes a forthright heroine 
particularly when she is standing up to angelos lechery shes also 
beguiling as she gradually realizes she is falling in love with the 
duke their embrace at the end of the play is a triumph of the 
romantic spirit that until then has been overshadowed by lust 
lamos minimizes the comic characters here but there are some 
expert comic cameos by lois smith as a blowzy aging prostitute and 
jack weston as pompey that experienced bawd turned apprentice 
executioner weston seems as comfortable and proficient with 
shakespeare as he does with television sitcom a remarkable 
accomplishment 
several of the minor characters are at odds with lamos unfussy 
direction particularly reggie montgomery as an overly mannered pimp 
and thomas ikeda as a grating onenote policeman 
measure for measure always has been called one of 
shakespeares problem plays because of its juxiposition of comedy 
and tragedy both are very near the surface of this dissection of 
sexual and governmental power its to the credit of the director 
and his fine cast that the right balance has been found between the 
two

devout roman catholics inspired by the 
visions of a pipefitter from suburban new orleans and the curious 
gathered in a vegetable field near this tiny southeastern louisiana 
town sunday hoping to see the virgin mary 
some of the estimated 3000 people present said they did indeed 
see what they came to see 
i believe that i saw her jesus joseph and the angels and the 
saints said shelly ann theresa 28 from the new orleans suburb 
of covington im kind of nervous and overwhelmed 
some took pictures of the sun with instant cameras and pointed to 
the splotchy multicolored images as evidence that holy apparitions 
had appeared 
see heres the blessed mother said diane deroche of luling 
as she pointed to a photograph she had taken 
theresa thibodeaux of hammond also held photos taken earlier in 
the day of what she said were the gates of heaven 
im expecting a miracle im blind in this eye and i have 
glaucoma in the other my nephew is crippled and my uncle has 
cancer she said beginning to sob it may not be for me but i 
believe in my heart you have to believe for a miracle 
alfredo raimondo 52 is the man whose tales of miraculous 
visions sparked the huge turnout at tickfaw a few weeks ago the 
tunisian native now a pipefitter from chalmette said the virgin 
mary had appeared to him recently and told him to go to tickfaw to 
honor st joseph 
raimondo stayed sequestered in a mobile home on the edge of the 
vegetable field early sunday but later emerged and began wandering 
among the faithful many of whom reached out to touch him as he 
ambled through the crowd 
im very happy he said were letting joseph show us the 
way there are a lot of people here 
not everyone was sure a miracle would happen 
we wanted to see what was going to happen were going to mass 
here and anything else is extra said george rand 
outside raimondos trailer families with lawn chairs and coolers 
ate picnic lunches in the 80 degree sunshine while someone led hail 
mary prayers over a loudspeaker 
women knelt in muddy ruts among the cabbages and onions saying 
prayers some had floral crosses by their sides 
others knelt before a st josephs altar heaped with food 
flowers and a picture of the last supper 
a large wooden cross had been erected in the field by raimondo 
a spokesman for the archdiocese of new orleans did not 
immediately return a telephone call sunday seeking comment on the 
vision reports 
last summer about 12000 people gathered for a mass on the 
grounds of a charismatic church in lubbock texas where three 
parishioners claimed to receive messages from the virgin mary 
the three parishioners said they began receiving messages from 
the virgin mary arlier in the summer shortly after they returned 
from a pilgrimage to medugorje yugoslavia where six youths claim 
they have seen apparitions of mary since 1981

an extreme rightist party won 
seven city council seats in municipal elections sunday that dealt a 
crushing defeat to chancellor helmut kohls christian democrats 
the extremeright national democratic party took 66 percent of 
the vote according to preliminary results winning representation 
in city government for the first time since 1968 
in january another farright party the republicans won seats 
in the west berlin legislature 
both parties want to sharply reduce the number of foreigners in 
west germany and their success marks a major shift to the right 
among a growing number of voters 
about two hours after the preliminary results of the vote became 
known several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall 
against the national democrats police reported no incidents 
kohls conservatives suffered heavy losses in other 
municipalities in hesse state but their worst rout came in 
frankfurt where they had governed alone since 1977 
preliminary results from the official state voting office based 
on computer projections gave the christian democrats 366 percent 
of the frankfurt vote that dropped their representation in city 
government from 48 to 36 seats 
the leftist social democrats the mainstream opposition party 
won 401 percent and 40 seats up from 37 seats won after 1985 
elections the antinato greens won 101 percent and 10 seats up 
from eight previously 
the national democrats did not run in the 1985 elections 
the outcome ousted frankfurts christian democratic mayor wolfram 
brueck who will be replaced by social democrat volker hauff a 
48yearold former federal transport minister 
the leftist greens also scored major gains in the rest of hesse 
state where 41 million voters were eligible to vote the social 
democrats were projected to score moderate statewide gains 
the national democrats campaigned hard in frankfurt against the 
large number of foreigners in the city with 148000 foreigners 25 
percent of its population frankfurt has the largest proportion of 
foreigners of west german cities 
the issue was used by the republicans in the west berlin 
elections on jan 29 the republicans won 75 percent of the vote 
and 11 seats in west berlins legislature 
the rightists were projected to score minor gains outside 
frankfurt 
michael friedmann a jewish community leader and a christian 
democrat said the national democratic gains will have serious 
consequences 
this is the worst result of the election friedmann told 
hesse state television this will damage west germanys reputation 
abroad 
the outcome in frankfurt appeared to pave the way for a leftist 
coalition in frankfurt between the social democrats and the greens 
a similar coalition is expected to start governing in west berlin 
next week after an agreement between the social democrats and the 
alternative list a leftist party similar to the greens

a lawyer has accused a district attorney 
of making him a target of an undercover operation to coerce him into 
working against his own clients in a case his supporters say could 
endanger attorneyclient relations 
robin auld 43 who faces criminal charges in connection with the 
case has filed notice he plans to sue 6th judicial district 
attorney victor reichman auld contends reichman set up the 
undercover operation with the intent of trapping auld and forcing 
him to betray his own clients 
aulds lawyer hal haddon says the case threatens the countrys 
adversarial system of justice because a defendant has to be able 
to believe his own lawyer isnt working for the da 
he was charged last month with theft by receiving and of 
possession a dangerous weapon he said it was because he had 
rejected reichmans threats he faces trial may 22 in durango and 
could get up to eight years in prison and lose his law license if 
convicted 
reichman has declined to comment on the case against auld which 
he has turned over to a special prosecutor from another district 
keith cross of glenwood springs 
according to aulds complaint local law enforcement officials 
assigned a deputy sheriff brent pace to pose as a criminal 
defendant named colton young and approach auld for legal help a 
false charge and phony affidavit were filed in court to make it 
appear that young really was in legal trouble 
the officials supplied pace with 500 in public money to pay half 
of aulds fee the complaint said after auld won dismissal of the 
misdemeanor charges against pace pace offered to pay the remaining 
500 in legal fees in drugs and when auld refused pace offered him 
guns 
auld said he eventually agreed to keep an uzi machine gun as 
collateral on the balance pace owed and he was immediately 
arrested he contends reichman and police sergeant john ball offered 
him a deal in which no charges would be filed if auld agreed to 
set up three of his clients for reichman auld refused and 
reichman filed the weapons charges the complaint said 
cross the special prosecutor would not comment on the case but 
in a preliminary hearing he said that auld believed the gun pace 
had given him was stolen because thats what pace had said he also 
said auld knew the weapon had been altered to make it an illegal 
automatic weapon which auld disputes 
two lawyers were among 15 people several of them locally 
prominent who signed a public letter questioning reichmans 
treatment of auld attorney sam maynes one of the signers said the 
case goes to the very basis of the attorneyclient relationship 
its just not right and thats why i signed the letter 
aulds lawyer hal haddon made a similar point saying what 
stinks to me is setting up the defense bar and turning them against 
their own clients it destroys peoples faith youd wonder if your 
lawyer is working for the police 
aulds notice of intent to sue filed feb 14 said he will seek 
at least 1 million plus punitive damages for damage to his 
reputation cost of his defense and loss of earning capacity named 
along with reichman are the sheriff and police department in 
durango the city council county commission and the colorado 
department of public safety

israeli soldiers on sunday killed two 
palestinian guerrillas who entered israels selfdeclared security 
zone in south lebanon on a mission to infiltrate the jewish state 
the incident was likely to increase israeli demands that the 
united states halt its dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization 
in the occupied west bank a palestinian stabbed an israeli 
soldier in bethlehem and soldiers broke up a funeral for a 
17yearold palestinian who died sunday of wounds suffered in a 
clash the previous day 
the soldier was reported in fair condition and israel radio said 
his attacker was captured after being shot three times with rubber 
bullets 
radio reports said the soldier was stabbed with a kitchen knife 
as troops ordered youths to erase antiisraeli graffiti and take 
down outlawed palestinian flags 
the west bank man who died was identified as mohammed shrain of 
the aida refugee camp witnesses said soldiers blocked off the camp 
and fired tear gas and rubber bullets to block his funeral the army 
confirmed the death and said it placed a curfew on the camp 
at least 395 palestinians and 17 israelis been killed during the 
15month uprising against israels occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip 
in the occupied west bank the army sealed with concrete the home 
of a palestinian who stabbed an israeli soldier sunday in the 
biblical city of bethlehem arab and israeli news reports said 
an army spokesman said the alleged assailant was caught and 
confessed to the stabbing the sealing or demolition of homes is 
routine punishment for suspects in such attacks israel views the 
punishment as a deterrent to future perpetrators 
at least 12 palestinians were reported wounded sunday in clashes 
with soldiers throughout the occupied territories 
the army confirmed eight of the injuries 
the fighting in south lebanon erupted when two armed guerrillas 
were spotted on the edge of the israeli security zone near hasbaya 
about five miles north of israels border 
no israeli troops were injured israeli military officials said 
the radical popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command in a statement issued at rashaya lebanon said the 
guerrillas were among a group sent on a military operation into 
israel the others escaped said a group spokesman who insisted on 
anonymity 
the confrontation was the third between plo guerrillas and 
israeli soldiers in less than three weeks israel cited the two 
earlier encounters in calling on the united states to call off its 
dialogue with the plo 
israel maintains the fighting in the security zone is evidence 
that plo chief yasser arafat is violating his pledge to give up 
terrorism arafats pledge was behind the us agreement in december 
to open a dialogue with the plo 
israel established the six by 10mile wide zone in south lebanon 
to protect its northern border when it pulled most of its forces out 
of the region in 1985 ending a threeyear occupation 
arafat meanwhile was quoted sunday as saying he is willing to 
go to jerusalem to convince israels leaders to agree to an 
international conference on middle east peace but he said he would 
only do so with the agreement of other arab states 
arafat spoke in an interview with italys la repubblica 
newspaper he has made similar statements in the past 
also sunday the army said a colonel had been suspended from his 
post for allegedly stealing a wristwatch off the body of a dead 
guerrilla 
the colonel was identified only as col r and the spokesman 
said he was an experienced and a veteran fighter he was 
suspended from his post pending clarification of the legal 
ramifications of the incident the spokesman said

four scottish constables arrived sunday to calm 
families who say they cant put to rest loved ones killed by a 
terrorist bomb on pan am flight 103 until the victims personal 
belongings are returned to them 
the senior police officers wanted to ease the pain and confusion 
felt by many families of the 259 victims whose possessions have been 
withheld during the investigation of the dec 21 plane explosion 
over lockerbie scotland 
assistant chief constable paul newell said he and his fellow 
officers also wanted to quell rumors 
we got the feeling there was a great deal of misinformation 
about what we were doing with the personal items newell said 
we came to tell the relatives the truth right from the horses 
mouth 
more than 100 people gathered in boston to hear the constables 
reassurances that many of the victims personal belongings would be 
returned and to examine maps of the rugged terrain where the 
victims bodies were found 
its a very traumatic thing for us said joe horgan of west 
point pa whose brotherinlaw was on flight 103 you run the 
gamut of emotions reliving the whole thing 
horgan said the grieving families cant complete the healing 
process until those possessions are returned 
matthew coyle who lost one of his 20yearold twin daughters in 
the bombing said he and his wife came from their home in 
wallingford conn to try to make some sense of the tragedy 
its a step he said im not sure where its taking us but 
its a step 
jeanine boulanger of shrewsbury said that because officials had 
not recovered her 21yearold daughters body she had pinned all 
her hopes on retrieving some of the college students possessions 
she was an actress a singer a dancer and a poet mrs 
boulanger said these items her journal theyre the only 
tangible things we have to hold on to 
newell flatly denied rumors that investigators had destroyed 
victims property 
nothing but nothing could be further from the truth he said 
but we want to make sure to clarify that for people who right 
now have nothing 
police have found and catalogued more than 11000 items strewn 
over 40 miles of scottish countryside but even though ownership has 
been established and the property has been eliminated from the 
criminal inquiry most families are still waiting 
newell said the first property was returned in midfebruary via 
the us consulate in edinburgh and that the process was continuing 
in addition to those on board 11 residents of lockerbie were 
killed when the wreckage of the boeing 747 fell to the ground after 
an explosion the plane was en route from london to new york 
investigators have traced the bomb to a portable radio packed 
with the luggage but have not yet established what person or group 
was responsible 
the scottish officers also met over the weekend with about 120 
families in new york they were scheduled to travel to detroit on 
monday and canton ohio on tuesday before returning home

one of just two known sets of the records 
of one of the last chapters of world war ii is slowly falling apart 
the brittle yellowing records include copies of the briefs filed 
by attorneys in the international military tribunal for the far east 
a panel of judges from 11 countries who tried japans military and 
civilian leaders for war crimes 
printed on inexpensive paper and bound by string or paper clips 
they sit in two file cabinets in the rare book room of gonzaga 
universitys crosby library 
the quality of the paper and the printing is such that they 
will decay over time said bob burr gonzagas library director 
burr convinced the documents have great historical value said 
he is seeking grants to help preserve them the documents include 
the indictments and verdicts against 28 japanese leaders and a 
129page list of atrocities committed against prisoners 
they were apparently reproduced on a type of mimeograph machine 
using whatever paper was available in wartorn japan between 1946 
and 1948 
the only other known copy of the tribunal records is in the 
national archives unindexed and reproduced on the same cheap paper 
the documents were donated to the university last year by daniel 
mahoney a retired spokane attorney whose late father willis 
mahoney was acting chief prosecutor at the trials conclusion 
the tribunal was the japanese counterpart of the nuremburg trials 
of the nazi high command it convicted 25 japanese leaders 
including war minister hideki tojo who was ordered executed along 
with six others 
others were sentenced to prison for life or given long sentences 
although complete records of the 1946 nuremburg trials have been 
published the records of the far east tribunal have not burr said 
its an asset thats priceless mahoney said i dont want 
anything to happen to it 
his father a lawyer went to japan in 1946 to assist chief 
prosecutor joseph keenan and became acting chief prosecutor when 
keenan fell ill 
when the trials concluded the elder mahoney sent one set of 
records to the national archives and brought another set home to 
portland ore he later gave the set to his son with instructions 
they eventually be donated to gonzaga where both mahoneys attended 
law school 
ive read very little but the little ive read is 
fascinating mahoney said 
burr said he may seek grants to place the documents on microfilm 
a project that is tentatively estimated to cost as much as 20000

south africas main afrikaner 
church is likely to remain estranged from its black and mixedrace 
counterparts despite its latest and most explicit repudiation of 
apartheid two dissident white clergymen said sunday 
beyers naude and nico smith ministers who left the white dutch 
reformed church to join its black offspring wrote newspaper 
articles suggesting an irrevocable split was likely because of the 
white church leaderships reluctance to support concrete 
antiapartheid action 
naude and smith were assessing a fiveday conference they 
attended last week aimed at finding common ground among the church 
branches on racial issues 
during the conference the white church to which president pw 
botha and most of his cabinet belong declared apartheid a sin 
however delegates from the white church did not endorse a 
resolution advocating civil disobedience to oppose apartheid and did 
not join in a call for the abolition of specific racial segregation 
laws 
smith who broke from the white church in 1982 and now is a 
pastor in a black township wrote in the sunday times that the 
conference was in many ways a dialogue of the deaf 
those belonging to the world of the oppressor could not hear or 
understand the cries and anger of those living in the world of the 
oppressed he wrote the white church was once again exposed as 
a captive of the afrikaner volk people and the nationalist 
government 
naude whose split with the white church dates back to the 1960s 
wrote in the sunday star newspaper that the already fragile thread 
of fellowship may be irrevocably broken if whites react 
unsympathetically to the strong antiapartheid resolutions adopted 
by the black and mixedrace delegates 
one area of common ground established at the conference was 
opposition to the 33monthold state of emergency during which the

three more large solar 
flares each with the potential to disrupt radio transmissions and 
trigger aurora borealis have erupted on the sun in a wake of an 
unusually large blast researchers say 
a blast 36 times the size of earth that occurred thursday on the 
suns northeast quadrant was possibly the largest ever recorded 
researchers at holloman air force base said 
staff sgt leroy kirkegard said saturday that the huge eruption 
of gas from the surface of the sun was followed by another large 
explosion friday morning and three more on saturday he said the 
flare thursday measured a 4brilliant rating while the blast friday 
measured a 3brilliant 
flares that are big enough to disrupt radio transmissions are 
rated by astronomers from zerobrilliant to 4brilliant he said 
the three blasts that occurred saturday also in the northeast 
quadrant each rated 2brilliant he said 
thats uncommon to have that many big flares in the same 
region in the same day kirkegard said 
its a very disturbed area probably two to three earths in 
diameter said tom folkers a technical specialist and telescope 
operator at kitt peak national observatory near tucson ariz 
thursdays solar flare extended some 70000 miles into space 
said researchers at sacramento peak just east of holloman and 
alamogordo 
the report i got from sacramento peak is its the largest 
one theyve seen ever said astronomer tom duvall at kitt peak 
this is pretty exciting for us up here 
air force maj james b near jr commander of hollomans solar 
observatory in the sacramento mountains said friday the flare was 
the size of 36 earths 
the violent eruptions created the potential to disrupt longrange 
communications on earth such as shortwave transmissions and 
satellite links researchers said 
folkers said ultraviolet radiation and xrays hit the earths 
upper atmosphere at noon thursday just eight minutes after the 
solar blast such radiation travels at the speed of light he said 
slowermoving particles are expected to pelt the outer atmosphere 
for days as a result of thursdays flare he said 
what happens when you have a solar flare is that the cosmic 
particles hit the ionosphere and shatter it folkers said 
the ionosphere about 120 miles above the earths surface 
normally acts like a mirror reflecting radio transmissions back to 
the surface said folkers who said he studies solar flares as a 
hobby 
after it is disrupted by the solar particles the ionosphere 
gradually reassembles and regains its reflective ability he said 
in the meantime he said people listening to shortwave broadcasts 
might notice that stations tend to fade out 
he also said there may be more aurora borealis sightings in 
coming days as the solar particles interact with the earths 
magnetic field

embattled navajo chairman peter 
macdonald ordered two tribal officials fired and locks on two 
buildings changed prompting a predecessor to say sunday that the 
move represented a police state 
macdonald has been under fire since witnesses including his son 
told a us senate select committee last month that he had taken 
kickbacks and bribes from companies wanting to do business with the 
nations largest indian tribe 
the latest developments came after a meeting friday by 44 
dissident members of the 88member tribal council the dissidents 
elected an interim chairman and vice chairman and placed vice 
chairman johnny r thompson on administrative leave 
that same day macdonalds staff was ordered to fire james 
henderson director of the legislative affairs office and henderson 
aide larry foster said alyce rouwalk assistant area director for 
the navajo office of the federal bureau of indian affairs 
macdonald has accused henderson and foster of siding with the 
dissidents 
late friday tribal police were ordered to change the locks on 
the council building and the legislative office said ms rouwalk 
former tribal chairman peterson zah said in an interview sunday 
on phoenix radio station kfyi that macdonalds move was uncalled for 
and represented another case of excessive use of police force on 
this reservation 
so in essence the bottom line is we really have a police state 
here zah said 
following the senate committee hearings the council voted feb 
17 to place macdonald on leave but he has maintained he is still in 
charge 
macdonald spokeswoman pazbah mccullah said saturday the chairman 
had no comment on fridays events no one could be reached for 
comment sunday because tribal offices were closed 
approximately 150000 of the navajos 200000 members live on the 
reservation which includes much of northeastern arizona as well as 
parts of northwestern new mexico and southeastern utah

about 2500 veterans and supporters from nine 
states marched sunday at the art institute of chicago to demand that 
officials remove a us flag placed on the floor in an art students 
exhibit 
at one point participants in the most recent of a series of 
protests attacked about a dozen students holding a 
counterdemonstration swinging fists and throwing hot coffee police 
intervened and no one was injured 
a veteran and four students were arrested said police officer 
mark halco 
the veteran was charged with battery two students were charged 
with disorderly conduct and the other two were charged with criminal 
damage to property for painting flags on the sidewalk in an effort 
to force demonstrators to walk on the flag halco said 
police led the students to a corner two blocks away from the 
demonstrators and surrounded them with barricades 
the flagwaving protesters led by local politicians and leaders 
of veterans groups chanted one two three four get the flag 
off the floor 
this symbol of our nation it is sacred it cannot be 
desecrated tom stack organizer of the protest the first 
amendment has limits 
another group of about 20 counterdemonstrators primarily artists 
from the chicago area stood nearby under heavy police guard they 
carried empty picture frames on sticks which they said showed the 
exhibit being protested was essentially empty of artistic merit 
but that the rights of artists to free expression should be upheld 
this is a misguided protest barry casilly 31 said of the 
veterans protest theyre trampling all over everything the flag 
stands for 
the flag part of an exhibit of 66 minority artists work 
features the stars and stripes positioned in such a way that viewrs 
are likely to step on it the work also shows photos of flagdraped 
coffins and south koreans burning the flag 
protests began about a week after the exhibit titled what is 
the proper way to display a us flag opened feb 17 veterans 
and others have tried several times to remove the flag a circuit 
court rejected a lawsuit contending the work desecrates the flag 
i just think its a sin to have the flag on the floor said 
vietnam veteran michael boorsma 38 of suburban batavia it 
bothers me tremendously 
student artist dread scott tyler on saturday called his 
exhibit revolutionary and said he had no apologies 
the exhibit opened for a few minutes sunday morning but was 
closed after veterans repeatedly picked up the flag said security 
guard alicia lloyd 
veterans came to the demonstration from illinois wisconsin west 
virginia michigan indiana oklahoma new york vermont and 
arkansas the crowd overflowed from the sidewalk in front of the 
building closing busy michigan avenue 
state sen walter dudycz who has demonstrated against the work 
at the school of the art institute almost daily since the 
controversy began said he would cosponsor legislation to toughen 
laws against desecrating the flag 
the republican lawmaker and gop mayoral candidate edward vrdolyak 
distributed a list of corporate sponsors of the art institute and 
urged a letterwriting campaign to pressure them into cutting off 
funding 
we want them to know their money is supporting an institution 
that is desecrating the american flag dudycz said 
vietnam veteran terry hueser 43 burned his art institute 
membership card and said he would no longer support the institution

police on sunday recovered the last bodies 
from the crash site of an air ontario jet investigators said the 
planes voice and flight recorders were destroyed making it harder 
to find the cause of the crash that killed 24 people 
the chief investigator of the canadian aviation safety board joe 
jackson would not rule out the possibility that snow and sleet on 
the wings of the fokker f28 contributed to fridays crash 
sixtynine people were on board the dutchbuilt jet when it took 
off from dryden for winnipeg manitoba and crashed a half mile away 
from the runway 
all of the bodies that were in the burnedout fuselage have 
been removed said ontario provincial police constable bill 
brayshaw 
twelve more bodies were recovered sunday bringing the total of 
bodies recovered to 22 two of the 47 survivors died in hospitals 
police attributed the slow process of recovering the bodies to 
the thighdeep snow and rough terrain at the site 
a temporary morgue was set up at the hockey arena in this 
papermill town of 6500 people 200 miles northwest of duluth minn 
on the transcanada highway 
plans were made to send the burned bodies to toronto on monday 
for identification 
investigators said sunday that the planes two black boxes melted 
in the fire that followed the crash 
it will make the investigation tougher said jackson he said 
the boxes were at the tail end of the plane away from the main 
fire and he did not know why they were so badly damaged 
as local churches in dryden held memorial services for the 
victims air ontario denied allegations by some survivors that the 
twinengine jet crashed because it was overloaded or had too much 
snow or ice on the wings 
paul mcknight vice president of the regional commuter airline 
based in london ontario told reporters the plane was not 
overloaded and the pilot was experienced in flying in bad weather 
but jackson did not rule out the possibility that the wings had 
too much slush or snow 
there are indications from various sources that the wings were 
contaminated with snow and slush said jackson weve been 
trying to find material evidence to prove there was snow and slush 
on the wings 
mcknight said the damage to the plane which broke into three 
pieces was so extensive that it indeed was a miracle that 45 
people survived 
the planes pilot capt george morwood 52 of london was one 
of three crew members who died in the crash the other crew member 
a stewardess survived 
air ontario said it would not release a passenger list until all 
the fatalities were identified 
the last fatal crash in canada of a regularly scheduled 
commercial flight was in 1979 when a quebecair fairchild 27 went 
down in quebec city killing 17 people 
canadas worst air disaster occurred in 1985 when 256 people 
mainly american servicemen returning to kentucky from the middle 
east died in the crash of a chartered dc8 in gander newfoundland

the sister of american hostage terry 
anderson said sunday that she fears the satanic verses 
controversy has worsened relations between moslem extremists and the 
west and made his release seem unlikely 
the situation has fallen apart again peggy say said after a 
prayer service for anderson in his hometown in upstate new york 
it seems like every time we get close something unpredictable 
happens 
immediately after president bushs inauguration in january there 
were signs that anderson might soon be freed after nearly four years 
in captivity in beruit lebanon according to mrs say she didnt 
specify what signs but said the political climate at the time was 
more encouraging than it had been in many months 
but she said she feared that the animosity that has arisen over 
publication of the satanic verses by british author salman 
rushdi has damaged the political climate and made the release of 
western hostages more remote 
the iranian government has called for rusdies death on the 
grounds that the novel is blasphemous 
the situation now is not very good mrs say said but 
were not going to give up 
anderson 41 the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press was kidnapped march 16 1985 in beruit he is the 
longest held of 13 foreign hostages 
about 100 residents of batavia listened to a roll call of the 
hostages in a high school gymnasium and heard mrs say urge them not 
to allow anderson to be forgotten 
mrs say believes that if andersons captors think the american 
people no longer care about the hostages they will be killed 
terry is counting us to keep his cause alive she said 
earlier the rev david scheider principal of notre dame high 
school appealed for the nation to show support for the hostages 
scheider said andersons plight should be viewed from a humanitarian 
standpoint and not politically 
exhostages report that anderson is being held in a closet 
blindfolded and has been beaten by his captors 
the service in batavia was the first of a number of observances 
as anderson enters his fifth year of captivity another service is 
planned monday in buffalo ny with mrs say and the rev lawrence 
jenco who was imprisoned with anderson for a time in the middle 
east 
exhostages and hostage families will gather in washington on 
thursday for a service sponsored by the journalists committee to 
free terry anderson and a group known as no greater love 
there also will be a service in lorain ohio andersons 
birthplace anderson moved to upstate new york when he was 6 and 
graduated from batavia high school in 1965

queen elizabeth ii sent a message monday to the 48 
members of the british commonwealth saying they had a particular 
role in combating the global threat of pollution 
it was the queens commonwealth day message to the organization 
of britain and its colonies and followed speeches given last week by 
prince philip her husband and prince charles her son on damage 
to the earths resources 
she said nothing during the past year underlined world 
interdependence more forcefully than the growth in awareness of the 
serious dangers mans own activities pose to the environment 
the threat to the environment takes many forms of which some 
are so far reaching that it is difficult to grasp them she said 
we hear for example of the possibility of radical changes in 
our climate leading among other things to a rise in the sea level 
with all that would mean for small islands and lowlying regions 
the commonwealths concern for resources means partnership not 
only across the oceans but also between generations she said 
prince charles the heir to the throne addressed an 
international conference in london last week and appealed for the 
elimination of chlorofluorocarbon gases which are destroying the 
ozone layer that protects the earth from harmful radiation from the 
sun 
in a lecture last week prince philip spoke of the pressures of 
having to produce increasing amounts of food to feed growing 
populations and the strain that placed on the earths resources

the french voted sunday for new city councils in 
elections marked by a record low turnout slight progress for 
leftist parties and the surprising emergence of the ecologists 
the socialists and communists who had squabbled for months over 
the formation of joint lists of candidates lost some of their 
support to the greens as the ecologist party is known 
the traditional right and centerright parties the rally for the 
republic and union for french democracy suffered in some areas at 
the hands of the extremeright national front 
turnout was estimated at between 70735 percent the lowest for 
municipal elections since the end of world war ii turnout in the 
last municipal elections in 1983 was 784 percent 
in municipalities where no list won an absolute majority a second 
round of voting will be held next sunday that balloting will 
include all lists that received at least 10 percent of the first 
vote 
with about 70 percent of the vote reported sunday night the 
ecologists never previously a force in france were expected to win 
between 4 and 5 percent of the vote nationally and more in some 
areas such as 128 percent in strasbourg and 14 percent in st 
brieuc 
in lille in northern france where the mayor is pierre mauroy 
head of the nations governing socialist party the greens won 84 
percent 
antoine waechter head of the ecologists said his party was 
demonstrating that they are a political force that is implanting 
itself here as they are in other european countries 
public opinion is becoming aware of the gravity of the 
ecological crisis and the absence of will by successive governments 
no matter what their political color to deal with it 
jeanmarie le pen the national front leader who won 144 percent 
of the vote in the first round of the presidential election last 
spring praised what he called his partys remarkable success 
the national front has created the only novelty of this 
election because in 1983 it counted only 011 percent of the vote 
today it could be credited with 7 percent on the national 
level le pen said 
when you take into account that we did not present candidates 
in all cities thats a remarkable success 
municipal elections generally are fought on local issues but the 
results can provide a sense of the national power of the parties 
few significant changes were noted in sundays voting 
socialist premier michel rocard said the vote confirmed the 
great choices that the president and the government have proposed to 
the country 
marcel debarge a national secretary of president francois 
mitterrands socialist party said there was an unspectacular gain 
by the left a certain loss by the traditional right and a stronger 
than expected resistance by the national front which i regret 
charles pasqua a leading figure in the conservative rally for 
the republic said his party would make no deals with the national 
front in the runoff electionsle pen called that attitude the road 
to suicide 
voting took place in 36757 communities 
in frances three largest cities paris marseille and lyon 
there appeared to be no big shakeups 
conservative mayor jacques chirac was in no danger of losing 
control of paris though it appeared he would not sweep all 20 of 
the citys districts as he did six years ago 
warfare in marseille between two socialist lists one official 
and the other unofficial did not appear to benefit the right 
in lyon conservative former trade minister michel noir was 
virtually assured of ousting centerright mayor francisque collomb 
disgruntled with a socialistcommunist government the french 
used the 1983 municipal elections to protest allowing the right to 
take over many city halls previously held by the left 
this time with mitterrand and rocard still riding comfortably 
high in the popularity polls there seemed to be less of a protest 
vote 
the socialist and communist parties agreed to run joint lists of 
candidates in only about 60 percent of towns with more than 20000 
residents conservative and centrist candidates shared a slate of 
candidates in about 95 percent of those towns

israeli researchers have found a link between 
sex hormones and the skeletal system of animals opening the way to 
a better understanding of osteoporosis the weizmann institute of 
science said sunday 
the findings could help explain the high incidence of the 
degenerative bone disease in women following menopause a statement 
from the institute said 
the institute discovered in recent experiments with laboratory 
rats that the skeletal system responds to the animals main sex 
hormone the institutes statement said 
osteoporosis is characterized by increased porousness and 
brittleness in bones associated with the loss of calcium it leads 
to an increased risk of fracture 
an estimated 15 to 20 million people suffer from the disease in 
the united states alone resulting in an annual total of 13 million 
fractures with a mortality rate of 5 to 14 percent according to 
figures from the institute there is no known cure only methods of 
slowing the progress of the disease 
although sex hormone deficiency has been associated with 
osteoporosis and such hormones have been used for treatment the 
disease was believed to result from processes only indirectly 
related to hormone deficiency said institute spokesman nehemiah 
myers 
the research team was led by professor alvin m kaye of the 
institutes hormone research and included his associates from tel 
aviv university 
the study is to be published in the proceedings of the national 
academy of sciences of the united states 
the research shows that bones of female rats respond biologically 
to the female hormone estrogen but are unaffected by its male 
counterpart testosterone in male rats bone tissue is stimulated 
selectively by testosterone 
but kaye added the situation in bones is quite complex and 
the stimulatory effects of estrogen and testosterone here are 
closely linked to other factors including the level of vitamin d 
metabolites 
the interdependence of these reactions could help explain why 
there has never been a clear association between the level of blood 
estrogen and the appearance of osteoporosis kaye said 
osteoporosis is much more prevalent in women who may undergo an 
80 percent reduction in estrogen production following menopause the 
institute said it noted that men show only a moderate lowering of 
testosterone levels 
kaye is a professor of endocrinology at the institute which is a 
leading israeli research facility in the natural sciences it is in 
rehovot south of tel aviv

most people expect to find firearms at a shooting 
range and art in a museum but the new king county police range will 
combine the two with a sculpture made of guns 
artist tom brennan has melted down more than 100 firearms 
confiscated by police to create the sculpture that will be mounted 
outside the shooting range next month 
john hosford executive director of the citizens committee for 
the right to keep and bear arms and a retired police officer called 
brennans project a totally inappropriate use of public funds 
and said the artist is using weapons to create an image that guns 
are bad 
brennan makes no bones about it 
the artist who lives in a highcrime area in central seattle 
said his piece takes items with bad vibes and turns them into 
something pleasing and gentle 
at least im taking some of these weapons out of circulation i 
would like to take more the 37yearold artist said of the 
sawedoff shotguns handguns and other objects in his sculpture 
the 8000 project for the range was funded by the king county 
arts commission 
king county police officer george minnich who for 20 years has 
overseen the property room where confiscated guns are stored said 
all the weapons given to brennan were unsafe or illegal and must be 
destroyed by law anyway 
it gives us a good place to get rid of them he said 
its better than some other uses ive seen for them agreed a

the leaders of 45 moslem states and 
the plo meet monday at a conference that will likely be dominated by 
saudiiranian clashes over ethics and politics 
this kingdom has refused to suppport irans death order against 
british novelist salman rushdie and it is not expected to change 
its position at the organization of the islamic conference 
the saudis also are expected to clash with iran over the question 
of recognition of the afghan guerrilla government 
arab diplomatic sources said iran sent a delegation to riyadh on 
saturday for meetings to set the agenda for the fourday conference 
but that the delegation returned to tehran without taking part in 
the meetings 
irans islamic republic news agency said an iranian delegation 
headed by the deputy chief of the islamic propagation organization 
mohammad ali taskhiri left tehran sunday to attend the conference 
conference secretarygeneral hamed alghabid confirmed the 
conference will take up the issue of rushdies controversial novel 
the satanic verses which some say blasphemes islam 
saudi arabias 16 million people are mainly sunni moslems irans 
50 million people overwhelmingly belong to the shiite moslem sect 
long at odds with the sunnis 
most sunnis agree with iran that the satanic verses should be 
banned but they have stopped short of supporting ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinis call feb 14 for moslems to seek out and kill rushdie an 
indianborn moslem who lives in britain 
shiites comprise onetenth of the worlds 1 billion moslems and 
the iranians are clearly outnumbered in their bid to gain support 
for the death threat 
but arab diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
khomeini apparently wants to press ahead in an effort to persuade 
moslems to view and support his campaign as a defense of islam

withdrew from afghanistan last month after nine years of 
intervention 
the saudis have recognized the socalled interim afghan 
government an alliance of pakistanbased sunni guerrillas formed 
last month and are pressing other moslem nations to do so sudan

after trying to blame leftist 
rebels the military sunday admitted responsibility for the sept 21 
slaying of 10 peasants and said nine soldiers including two 
officers will stand trial for the massacre 
the slayings and subsequent coverup were a grave violation of 
normal operating procedures said an armed forces statement 
it said an intelligence unit major a second lieutenant two 
staff sergeants a corporal and four privates from the 5th brigades 
jiboa battalion will be turned over to civilian judicial 
authorities to stand trial 
col jose emilio chavez caceres a brigade officer relieved of 
his command will be reinstated because he was innocent of any 
wrongdoing and was lied to by his subordinates it said 
i think its a breakthrough ambassador william walker said 
of sundays developments 
the high command of the armed forces is admitting that 
their earlier versions have not held up under examination and were 
wrong scurrilous he told a group of reporters 
but walker said it was too early to say if the massacre case 
marked a real change in the militarys traditional impunity in human 
rights abuses 
at first the military claimed the peasants were rebels who 
ambushed a jiboa battalion patrol and were killed in fierce 
combat in the hamlet of san francisco near brigade headquarters 
in san vicente a city 36 miles east of san salvador 
however news reports quoting witnesses said a 33man patrol 
marched into san francisco rounded up the villages 15 families in 
the schoolhouse separated the 10 peasants and accused them of 
collaborating with guerrillas 
witnesses said the seven men and three women were taken to a 
nearby ravine tied up blindfolded and killed with hand grenades 
some witnesses said they also heard bursts of rifle fire after the 
explosions 
the next day the rest of the villagers found the bodies in the 
ravine covered with a banner of the farabundo marti liberation front 
rebel coalition witnesses said 
the military claimed the peasants were killed after being 
detained for involvement in the activities of subversive 
organizations and possessing explosives and propaganda 
sundays statement said an investigation found the soldiers had 
lied to their superiors and that maj mauricio beltran granados an 
intelligence officer had ordered the peasants killed 
it was the worst mass slaying of civilians in four years in el 
salvador the united states which provides el salvador with an 
average of 15 million daily in military and economic aid has been 
pressing the government to bring those responsible to justice 
during a visit in february vice president dan quayle insisted 
that those responsible be sought and tried walker who rarely 
leaves the capital because of the war visited the provincial judge 
handling the case to stress us interest in the affair 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed since the civil war 
began more than nine years ago

when shellie wilkes was interviewing for a 
job with the peoria citycounty health department she wondered how 
shed ever handle the grim task of telling people they had aids or 
were exposed to the disease 
i remember asking myself how can anyone stand that kind of job 
every day said mrs wilkes program coordinator in the sexually 
transmitted disease division 
it can be depressing she said but if weve helped 
others avoid getting infected with aids then its all worth it 
in the last nine months she and other health department 
employees across illinois have been tracking down people who have 
had dangerous contact with aids patients either through sexual 
relations or sharing of hypodermic drug needles to break the news 
that they may have been exposed to the deadly virus 
a state law that took effect last july requires everyone who 
tests positive for the aids virus to notify their sex partners or 
anyone with whom they shared needles 
the law allows victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome to 
simply give the names of their partners to their local health 
department and let officials spread the word 
illinois has been a leading state in passing legislation to fight 
aids including a law requiring aids tests for people seeking 
marriage licenses the law has been blamed for sending many couples 
to adjoining states to get married 
in chicago notification of possible aids infection is not 
spreading as quickly as health officials would like because of a 
lack of manpower 
we do the best we can but weve only got two investigators to 
cover the entire city said brian chapman director of chicagos 
aids surveillance unit weve made about 70 or 80 notification 
attempts and been successful on about 40 or 50 
he said the need to protect confidentiality also makes the job 
difficult 
people with aids are losing their jobs their families their 
incomes chapman said we must protect them and be discreet 
like mrs wilkes chapman finds the job depressing at times 
the emotions go from a to z he said some people are 
absolutely shocked others are not surprised it can get to you but 
you have to view it with a professional eye 
mrs wilkes is motivated by the need to educate people about the 
dangers and facts of being exposed to aids 
we try not to give them a false sense of hope she said we 
also tell them that they arent necessarily infected with aids 
simply because theyve been exposed to it 
illinois department of public health statistics show 2580 cases 
of aids have been reported in illinois with the bulk of those 
2329 in the metropolitan chicago area 
a random survey of health departments in central illinois only 
produced a handful of instances where the aids notification law has 
been invoked but officials expect that phase of their job to grow 
with the number of aids cases 
peoria county had its first case reported in 1984 and there were 
seven last year bringing the total to 14 half of which have been 
fatal

dame joan sutherland operas most famous 
coloratura soprano who made her metropolitan opera debut in lucia 
di lammermoor in 1961 to great acclaim sang her first solo 
recital at the met on sunday and again deserved the acclaim she 
received 
her husband conductor richard bonynge was her deferential piano 
accompanist 
dame joan has spent most of her career in the bel canto opera 
repertoire singing soprano parts written to show off the sound of 
the voice its beauty flexibility and accuracy with much less 
emphasis on the words 
she chose that type of song and aria for her recital shes still 
a singer well worth hearing who can be greatly enjoyed and 
appreciated 
for the most part she didnt choose flamboyant selections and 
she only chose two that are generally familiar those were balfes 
i dreamt i dwelt in marble halls and offenbachs o mon cher 
amant from la perichole 
many of the songs were extravagantly melancholy like the first 
sad likeness of my phyllis by bellini with its line i have 
shed bitter tears over your ashes 
her one encore was theres no place like home as she sang 
it dame joan glanced up and around the opera house the met isnt 
ever so humble but it has been one of her special homes where 
she is always happily greeted for almost three decades 
its interesting that even a simple tune like theres no place 
like home sounds like an aria when dame joan sings it several of 
the other songs in the recital were combinations of folk and art 
songs they sounded sung by this singer like classical art songs 
dame joan didnt use her first two or three songs to loosen her 
vocal chords she sounded fine from the beginning her silver 
flute voice has become a bit darker but not much the difference 
is heard more in added warmth her accuracy is phenomenal she sang 
perfect trills in some of the brief coloratura passages the two 
selections on the program with the most exciting coloratura were 
riccis 1850 io non sono piu lannetta and massenets 1888 
autumn thoughts we particularly enjoyed tostis flowingly 
melodic la serenata and the six massenet songs 
other composers heard were meyerbeer rossini donizetti david 
bizet chaminade godard and gounod 
sometimes dame joans tone sounds a bit hollow and sometimes she 
scoops up to notes which isnt new but her tone is beautiful she 
isnt shrill or harsh 
the capacity audience jumped up to award the singer a standing 
ovation

the annual calle ocho festival drew crowds estimated 
at more than 1 million people to the little havana section sunday 
despite a gangrelated shooting and controversy over a ban on 
singers who performed in cuba 
a boy was hospitalized in stable condition following the 
shooting which involved rival youth gangs three blocks from the 
edge of the festival police said four juveniles were arrested and 
charged with attempted murder 
nearly 300 people were arrested at the festival mostly youths 
charged with fighting drinking or disorderly conduct police said 
one officer was slightly injured when he was hit above the left eye 
with a bottle 
more than a million people flocked to the 23block little havana 
area whose main street is eighth street or calle ocho for latin 
music dancing and food according to police and the sponsoring 
kiwanis club 
amid the fun the weeklong dispute over the ban of singers denise 
de kalafe andy montanez and de raymond seemed almost forgotten the 
bans drew sharp criticism from many in miami where hardline 
opposition to any contacts with cuba is not as widespread as in the 
past 
some remained upset sunday night 
i would like to see andy montanez right here said jose 
morese of west palm beach its not fair 
food vendor malee buther said the controversy may have kept some 
people away 
last year was so crowded you had to push people to walk she 
said this year there are not so many people 
kiwanis officials tried to avoid further controversy involving 
wilfredo vargas a dominican merengue idol who performed for 10000 
dancing fans in bayside downtown saturday despite disclosures he 
performed in cuba 10 years ago 
kiwanis officials claimed they lacked proof vargas played in 
cuba even as a local radio station played excerpts from his 
habana jam album 
vargas declined to answer questions about the issue discussing 
only his performance of fast dominican ballroom dance music 
it was a contagious merengue and the people vibrated with the 
sound he said

the bomb that blew up in a van being driven by 
the wife of a navy captain who mistakenly ordered the destruction of 
an iranian airliner was a nonmilitary device possibly homemade 
the fbi said sunday 
the bomb was an improvised exploding device that would suggest 
it was not some kind of a manufactured military bomb fbi 
spokesman gene riehl said 
a pipe bomb would fit into that generic family he said 
adding that it may have been homemade 
the bomb set fire to a van being driven friday by sharon rogers 
whose husband capt will rogers iii commander of the uss vincennes 
in the persian gulf gave the goahead last july to shoot down an 
aircraft mistakenly believed to be an iranian fighter the plane 
identified only from its radar blip was actually a civilian 
airliner and all 290 people on board were killed 
mrs rogers was not hurt 
the new york times in its monday editions quoted an 
unidentified federal official as saying investigators have compiled 
a description of a man of middle eastern appearance who was seen in 
the rogerses neighborhood in the past several months 
the official said the man approached passersby asking where 
does the captain live 
riehl refused to disclose more of what the fbis investigation 
had found and also declined to comment on an iranian newspaper 
editorial that blamed the fbi for the bombing saying it was 
engineered to provoke antiiranian sentiment in the united states 
we have no response to that at all he said 
the englishlanguage newspaper kayhan international linked the 
alleged us plot to western anger at ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
order that british novelist salman rushdie be killed for his new 
novel the satanic verses 
the bombing will not be the last attempt to implicate iran 
over the rushdie controversy kayhan international said in an 
editorial summarized by irans official islamic republic news agency 
fbi spokeswoman kathy kennedy in washington denied the allegation 
and added we have never made any linkage to iran since this 
incident happened 
the special agent in charge of the fbis san diego office tom 
hughes and dennis usery regional director of the naval 
investigative service met sunday with the rogerses they have been 
under the continuous protection of nis agents at an undisclosed 
location since shortly after the bombing 
it was a how are you feeling type of thing said riehl 
i think the meeting was more to reassure them a little bit or to 
help them through their trouble 
usery said the security surrounding the couple would continue 
indefinitely 
they are in good spirits usery said and they are aware of 
the necessity for security 
the rogerses returned home briefly saturday afternoon presumably 
to collect belongings 
chief craig huebler spokesman for the san diego naval base said 
the navy was awaiting fbi findings to determine if the couple would 
return to work monday mrs rogers is a teacher 
the captain remained in command of the vincennes whose home port 
is san diego as commander rogers would be required to stay in the 
san diego area huebler said sunday 
fbi officials also met sunday with representatives of nis 
alcohol tobacco and firearms san diego police and the county 
sheriffs department 
the agencies management staff have been meeting all day to 
evaluate what has happened and discuss theories and possibilities 
obviously none of which are going to be made public said riehl 
i think its safe to say this the meetings will happen every day 
until some resolution is come to 
riehl said that under justice department guidelines the fbi 
would not discuss any aspects of the investigative process involving 
possible prosecutive elements 
federal investigators ended their work late saturday at the 
university city intersection where the van exploded the van was 
taken away saturday evening but riehl refused to say where it was 
being kept 
thomas hughes agent in the charge of the san diego fbi office 
said saturday that the agency faced a lengthy analysis to determine 
what type of bomb was used but he said fragments indicated it could 
have been a pipe bomb 
government sources said the possibility of terrorism was being 
investigated officials confirmed the rogers family received 
threatening calls about the missile strike on the airliner 
rogers had driven the van earlier friday for a regular run to a 
nearby donut shop and felt he may have been the target of the 
bombing said sen pete wilson rcalif who talked with the 
captain

greasegobbling germs that eat themselves 
to death while cleaning drains are the secret weapons of a fledgling 
franchise business that bills itself as an hmo for restaurants 
biocare inc which has more than 200 clients in california is 
gearing up for a nationwide greasebusting attack with the backing 
of a venture capital arm of wr grace amp co the new yorkbased 
chemical and natural resources company 
bud mcmahon biocares founder and chairman has big plans for 
the little bugs his company uses which he claims are safer to 
handle than harsh chemical remedies 
every sink and toilet in the country is a potential client 
he said in our conservative projections we figure we will 
service about 10 percent of the 500000 food service outlets in 60 
months and the company at that time will have a value well over 
200 million he said 
the only way to get that many clients that fast he said is 
through a franchise organization we have to open up the flood 
gates to the entrepreneur in the areas who want to do this kind of 
business 
biocare is like an hmo or health maintenance organization 
because it offers regular maintenance at a fixed price and will 
correct any problems at no additional cost mcmahon said 
it seems to be working fairly well said norman fairchild 
kitchen manager at the tgi fridays chain restaurant in san mateo 
we had enough problems before that we needed a service like this 
they come out once a week for 15 or 20 minutes and spray into the 
drains in the restaurants and outside they guarantee their work so 
it seems a good deal 
the bugs that eat the grease are a blend of naturally occurring 
bacilli and pseudomonas bacteria that have been selectively adapted 
for biocare by sybron chemicals inc 
sybron a private company based in birmingham nj is the 
nations largest supplier of specialized bacterial cultures for the 
pollution control industry the company has sales of about 120 
million a year 
no genetic engineering was involved in creating the biocare 
formula instead the bacteria were chosen and cultivated for their 
ability to work together as they break down the types of foods that 
usually clog drains 
several kinds of the bacteria were developed and patented more 
than a decade ago others were mixed in to suit biocares focus on 
cleaning up the gunk most often found in restaurant kitchen drains 
it took nearly three years to come up with a formula test it 
refine it and produce a final product 
the bacteria break down animal fats and food products liquifying 
and digesting them and turning them into carbon dioxide water and 
bacterial cells the same way waste is normally disposed of in 
nature the biocare bacteria keep eating and multiplying until 
their food source is gone then they die off 
they grow very rapidly as long as theres a lot of food around 
and can double as fast as every 20 minutes said mike krupka 
marketing manager for sybrons biochemical division but then the 
beauty of it is once whatever is clogging the drain goes away or is 
totally consumed the bacteria run out of food and die off they eat 
themselves to death 
about 5 billion bacteria are in each gram in the teabaglike 
biosock packets used by biocare to eliminate grease trap 
overflow and reduce toxic odors associated with hydrogen sulfide 
accumulation 
these are all certified nonpathogenic bacteria meaning they 
dont cause disease krupka said they are not used primarily to 
get rid of clogs but rather for preventive maintenance it keeps the 
grease from accumulating in the pipes and its not harsh or 
dangerous to handle the way strong chemicals can be 
clogged drains are more quickly cleared through a mechanical 
process then the bacteria are used regularly to keep them clear he 
said 
by april 1 biocare plans to have franchise applications filed 
in all 50 states by the end of the year it expects to have 15 
franchises in operation 
were going to grow it very slow so everybody has the 
opportunity to never make mistakes were trying to make all the 
mistakes now mcmahon said

boeing co officials and the union representing 
boeing production workers have authorized a new study of work 
conditions at the companys auburn plant where dozens of employees 
say theyve fallen ill from working with chemicals 
company and union officials on friday confirmed the new study 
last year dozens of auburn plant employees who worked with 
phenolic resins complained of illnesses ranging from headaches and 
nausea to memory loss twenty workers filed insurance claims 
the illnesses were the subject of congressional hearings two 
weeks ago in washington dc 
state and federal inspectors found the plant to be in compliance 
with safety standards but boeing still halted use of the resins 
used to make plastic parts for aircraft interiors 
were not convinced nor do we know thats the only problem 
said tom baker president of district 751 of the international 
association of machinists amp aerospace workers which represents 
40000 boeing workers 
baker said questions still linger about whether lowlevel 
exposure to the resins might cause health problems even if chemical 
levels in the air are within government limits 
a committee of six company and union executives decided to 
proceed with the new study recommended by occupational health 
experts from the university of washington and the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
dr alan ducatman director of environmental medical services at 
mit said he recommended an extensive study because nothing less 
would properly test some theories as to why the workers were getting 
sick he declined to outline those theories 
boeing spokesman paul binder declined to discuss details of the 
study saying they have not been settled

leaders of the futures industry will meet this 
week in boca raton fla the traditional sunny setting for their 
annual gathering but it will be clouded this year by a federal 
investigation of trading fraud at the worlds two largest futures 
exchanges 
nearly two months have elapsed since the fbi sting operation 
at the chicago board of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange 
was disclosed no indictments have been issued and the story has 
been replaced on the financial pages by fresher controversies 
yet the scandal remains a major concern among the 1100 brokerage 
executives money managers and exchange officers registered for the 
futures industry associations meeting and talk of it is likely to 
surface frequently in both private conversations and public 
discussions during the threeday affair 
people are calling me every day and asking whats going on 
with this thing said john damgard president of the 
washingtonbased trade group hardly a day goes by that we dont 
talk about what effect the investigation and the allegations are 
going to have on the program 
but only the justice department knows for sure where the probe is 
headed and its not talking 
what is known is that hundreds of grandjury subpoenas have been 
issued many of them to futures traders who have been questioned 
about the opportunities for cheating customers while executing their 
orders in the boisterous futures pits 
damgard said the governments investigation did not play a major 
role in shaping the fia meeting program but neither has the 
association shied away from scheduling sessions in which 
proberelated issues are bound to arise 
thursdays conferenceopening panel discussion on selfregulation 
and trading practices may further illuminate the chicago exchanges 
responses to the criticism that has buffeted the industry since the 
investigation was revealed board of trade chairman karsten cash 
mahlmann and chicago merc president william brodsky will be among 
the panelists 
i think you will find the possibility that a guy like cash 
mahlmann might discuss some of the changes the board of trade has 
announced said robert wilmouth who will moderate the session and 
who is himself president of the national futures association a 
congressionally mandated selfregulatory organization 
the board of trade is planning a 1 million upgrade of its 
computerized tradesurveillance system which federal regulators 
recently criticized as inadequate for detecting abuses and both 
chicago exchanges are reviewing their trading rules 
futures are contracts to buy or sell a commodity or financial 
instrument for a specified price at a future date 
the fia meeting also will include a speech thursday by wendy 
gramm chairman of the federal commodity futures trading commission 
which regulates futures trading and it will give many in the 
industry their first look at the chicago board of trades planned 
offhours electronic trading system 
the investigation in chicago is hastening the move toward 
electronic trading which will permit aroundtheclock trading of 
futures contracts and some contend provide a better audit trail 
than traditional openoutcry trading 
the board of trade revealed last month that it was working on an 
electronic trading system to compete with globex a similar system 
being developed by the chicago merc and londonbased reuters 
holdings plc

boeing commercial airplanes has increased its 
estimate of the commercial jetliner market for the next 16 years 
saying it expects 8417 aircraft worth a total 516 billion will be 
delivered by the end of 2005 
the new forecast is in boeings justreleased current market 
outlook which it publishes each year the report applies to the 
commercial jet industry as a whole and is not limited to boeing 
aircraft 
the dollar value is 246 percent above last years estimate of 
414 billion while the estimated number of aircraft has grown by 
1509 from the 6908 forecast in the 1988 report 
jack howard boeing commercial airplanes director of market 
research said the revised estimates are based on prolonged air 
travel growth fueled by continued growth in discretionary income and 
the decrease in the real cost of travel after allowing for 
inflation the report predicts relatively stable fuel prices and no 
recession for the foreseeable future 
about 70 percent of the new planes will be needed for growth in 
traffic the report said with the rest to replace aircraft going 
out of service 
while some industry analysts believe replacement sales will 
accelerate because of concerns over aging aircraft howard said that 
maintaining current fleets might be less expensive for airlines 
replacement with new jets could drive up operating costs and 
therefore the cost to the public which could slow air travel 
growth he said 
boeing estimates that on average airlines replace jets after 28 
years while others use a 25year estimate howard said boeing had 
predicted that 250 to 300 planes would be retired in 1988 but in 
fact only 60 were 
the current fleets are very reliable howard said airlines 
and air traveler confidence in the safety of these airplanes has not 
been lost 
still howards report indicates that replacements through 2005 
will be 20 percent higher in dollar value than last years estimate 
the report estimates stronger demand for airplanes in the 170to 
240seat category with the larger aircraft taking over domestic 
routes that have outgrown mediumsized airplanes in domestic 
service it also predicts a strong increase in short to 
mediumrange jets of more than 350 seats and a modest increase in 
demand for large longrange aircraft

a continuing strong growth in domestic employment

15year low of 51 percent in february from 54 percent the 
previous month created concerns that the us central bank may 
raise interest rates to cool down the economy in an evertightening 
labor market 
higher interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to 
foreign investors

educational and career advances by black 
women combined with a lull in the earning power of black men have 
narrowed the salary gap between the two a university of michigan 
researcher says 
by contrast white women are lagging in their attempt to close 
the wage gap with their male counterparts said reynolds farley a 
research associate with the schools population studies center 
this improvement in the earnings of black women compared with 
those of black men is the result of greater educational attainment 
more occupational opportunities for black women and a virtual 
stagnation of the earnings of black men in the last 15 years 
farley said last week 
in 1986 he said black women ages 25 to 54 earned an average of 
12100 a year or about 75 percent of the average black males 
yearly salary of 16000 white women in the same age bracket 
averaged 12800 roughly half the average white males annual pay 
compared with the incomes of most black men the average black 
womans income has risen sharply since world war ii farley said 
noting that in 1947 black women earned only 34 percent of a black 
mans average salary 
farley conducted the study with suzanne m bianchi a demographer 
at the us bureau of the census center for demographic studies

united mine workers have agreed to publicly debate issues in a 
contract dispute that has left coal miners in three appalachian 
states without a contract for more than a year

forum after a demonstration by coal miners outside pittston 
headquarters in greenwich last month and invited pittston chairman 
paul w douglas and mine workers president richard trumka to 
participate 
in separate letters friday to the rev c edward deyton pastor 
of diamond hill united methodist church in greenwich and fellowship 
chairman trumka accepted the offer and douglas designated gene

companys representative at the debate 
no date has been set for the forum in greenwich both douglas and 
trumka said they hope it can be scheduled soon

expressed hope that an evening of discussion would help bring 
about a healthy reconciliation

than a year without a contract in virginia kentucky and west 
virginia 
pittson a diversified company that also is involved in air 
freight and security systems employs about 1700 people in 20 
mines it has laid off about 4000 miners in recent years due to 
technological advances and the closing of mines

work without a contract while negotiations continued but accepted a 
30 to 60day cooling off period requested by the governors of the 
three states

about the forum saying last week i certainly have a hard time 
understanding how greenwich can be helpful in appalachia
