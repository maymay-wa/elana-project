the government has joined a whistleblower 
lawsuit that accuses litton industries inc of overcharging the 
pentagon 25 million for computer work according to court 
documents unsealed wednesday 
the justice department decision to intervene in the suit by a 
former litton employee suggests government investigators believe 
the allegations may have merit 
mary mcmenimen a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in 
los angeles declined to comment on the action 
the suit filed last april by former litton manager james 
carton alleges that the company in effect charged the government 
for work it did for commercial customers using the same computer 
system 
litton spokesman john thom denied wrongdoing by the beverly 
hillsbased company which makes electronic navigation and control 
gear for a variety of military planes and missiles 
the suit alleges the company programmed computers to 
underrecord the amount of commercial work while properly recording 
the volume of government work at the litton computer services 
division in the los angeles suburb of woodland hills 
overcharges on dozens of computer design and engineering 
contracts from 1981 through 1987 amounted to at least 25 million 
alleged cartons attorney john r phillips 
the action was brought under the false claims act which 
entitles those who report fraud against the government to get up to 
25 percent of any damages awarded 
carton decided to file suit only after complaints to company 
officials and a pentagon fraud hotline failed to bring action 
phillips said 
he told everybody within the division and they didnt do 
anything the lawyer said he talked to somebody at the hotline 
in general terms but he was not persuaded or convinced that they 
were really going to make a serious effort to do something about 
this 
thom refused to comment in detail on the allegations but 
maintained that joint governmentcivilian use of the computer 
system saved the pentagon money that is because civilian work 
could be scheduled during slack times in the government contracts 
and help defray operating cost of the system he said 
were going to fight it thom said we think the charges 
have no merit whatsoever 
the lawsuit doesnt specify which military systems might be 
involved in the alleged overcharges 
it doesnt name company officials responsible for the alleged 
overcharging but phillips said carton believed knowledge went at 
least as high as topdivision management 
carton who was technical director at the division from 1984 to 
1987 discovered the alleged costshifting while conducting a 
profitability study on the companys 30 commercial accounts 
phillips said commercial customers included businesses as diverse 
as kaiser steel and flynt publications publisher of hardporn 
hustler magazine 
carton 46 left litton on friendly terms during a 
reorganization of the divisions management in early 1987 and now 
works for another defense contractor northrop corp the attorney 
said 
in addition to its electronics work litton builds navy ships at 
its ingalls shipyard in pascagoula miss

democrat jill long scored a surprise 
victory over republican dan heath tuesday night in a special 
election for the house seat that launched the political career of 
vice president dan quayle 
long received 65160 votes or 51 percent to 63388 or 49 
percent for heath 
she will be the first democrat to represent northeast indianas 
4th congressional district since quayle won the 1976 congressional 
election and the 26th woman in the 435seat house of 
representatives 
it was the third try for a washington political office by long 
who lost a bid for the seat last november by a margin of nearly 
50000 votes and lost the 1986 senate election to quayle 
i knew it was going to be a close race long said in her 
victory speech i believed we were going to win the surprise 
would have been if there had been a large margin of victory 
i am committed to doing what i believe is right for northeast 
indiana and my country i have long believed that hoosiers are 
independent and when we put forth god candidates on either side 
we win long added 
in his concession speech heath said its a hard pill to 
swallow but i am a man and a good man and i did my best 
heath claimed his record and credentials as a candidate had been 
distorted in the campaign by negative advertising i apologize to 
no one and to no voter he said winning this race was a quest 
but not an obsession 
the polls closed at 6 pm est one hour after heath and long 
ended a final day of campaigning at restaurants and plant gates 
thundershowers which had been predicted for the afternoon and 
which democrats had feared would reduce turnout among bluecollar 
voters casting ballots after factory shift changes failed to 
materialize 
with voting predicted to dip as low as 30 percent among more 
than 200000 registered voters turnout efforts were more important 
than usual said party workers on both sides 
heath and long renewed their campaigns before sunrise each 
opening election day with a coffee shop stop here 
an independent poll taken in the week before the election showed 
heath with 44 percent and long with 36 percent with 20 percent 
still undecided 
the 4th district seat was vacated in january by republican 
incumbent dan coats who resigned to take the senate seat quayle 
occupied before becoming vice president 
in 1976 district voters were the first to send quayle to 
washington as a 28yearold congressman quayle won reelection in 
1978 then gave up the seat in a successful effort to defeat 
threeterm democratic senator birch bayh 
quayle and first lady barbara bush campaigned earlier for the 
republican candidate and former democratic presidential hopeful 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee campaigned for the democrat 
county election administrators decided to use paper ballots 
rather than voting machines or computer ballots to cut costs in an 
election that no one had budgeted allen county officials estimated 
paper ballots would save 20000

managers of the energy departments nuclear 
weapons complex near here said tuesday they have recommended 
putting off a series of safety tests until after one of its three 
idle reactors is restarted 
james moore president of westinghouse savannah river co which 
takes over as operator of the governmentowned complex saturday 
said ultrasonic testing for cracks in the reactor vessel and piping 
would be just an added burden that would not enhance safety 
the concept of doing the ultrasonic is really to get a good 
idea of the actual situation in the vessel to determine the 
longterm capabilities of the vessel he said its not a 
nearterm safety problem at all 
thenenergy secretary john herrington said last year that he 
would require ultrasonic testing of the plants k reactor before it 
could be restarted 
all three active reactors at the plant have been shut down for 
safety reasons since last april they are the nations only source 
of tritium a highly perishable gas needed to manufacture us 
nuclear weapons 
the pentagon has said that at least one of the reactors must be 
restarted by the end of this year to avert a serious shortage in 
tritium supplies 
moore in an interview with the associated press in his 
temporary office a few miles from the reactor complex said 
westinghouse remained committed to carrying out the ultrasonic 
testing 
to put in an ultrasonic testing programwould really be 
counterproductive in terms of all the other things going on he 
said 
energy department officials at the weapons plant are reviewing 
westinghouses recommendation to put off the testing the 
recommendation is part of a broad new plan that westinghouse 
presented to the department last week as a proposed blueprint for 
restarting the k reactor moore said 
moore declined to reveal other details of the restart strategy 
which he said he would be discussing with energy secretary james 
watkins over the next few weeks 
watkins has instructed westinghouse to give top priority to 
getting the k reactor running again but has stressed that 
operations would not resume until safety could be assured he has 
not commented directly on the question of whether ultrasonic 
testing is needed first 
the company that has managed the savannah river plant since its 
construction in the 1950s ei du pont de nemours amp co has used 
conventional tests with colored dyes to search for cracking in 
reactor vessels and piping and had said earlier this year that it 
planned to start ultrasonic testing this summer 
a leak from a crack in the vessel of another reactor at savannah 
river the the c reactor was discovered in 1984 that led to its 
permanent shutdown a year later

french premier michel rocard offered to reopen negotiations in 
paris on a bonus to cover high costs on the mediterranean island

living on corsica estimated at 42 percent more expensive than the 
french mainland

politicians stumped for memorable quotations 
to enliven their speeches need look no further than respectfully 
quoted a newly published book from the library of congress that 
is crammed with 2100 oratorical gems from the past 
the book might give some comfort to sen joseph biden ddel 
whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a 
controversy over cribbed comments 
if biden recalls a famous line from president kennedys 
inaugural address in 1961 he might be intrigued that lebanese 
writer kahlil gibran asked much earlier are you a politician 
asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking 
what you can do for your country 
the book a threeyear project by suzy platt of the librarys 
congressional reference division is a compilation of quotations 
which members of congress or their staffs over the past 75 years 
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and 
origins 
for the hapless politician scrambling to extricate himself from 
trouble theres this reputed quote from former republican 
presidential candidate george romney i didnt say that i didnt 
say it i said that i didnt say that i said it i want to make 
that very clear 
it was theodore roosevelt who cast this verbal harpoon at 
president john tyler he has been called a mediocre man but this 
is unwarranted flattery he was a politician of monumental 
littleness 
exasperation prompted former rep george e danielson dcalif 
to declare that trying to get answers from attorney general john n 
mitchell during house hearings on the watergate scandal in 1974 was 
like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall 
these quotations come from the real world of cutandthrust 
politics says charles a goodrum former assistant director of 
the librarys congressional research service which compiled the 
520page dictionary of political quotes they show the 
combination of spirit and humor that represents american political 
activity at its best 
ms platt amassed verified quotations which researchers began 
recording on 3by5 cards nearly 50 years ago to avoid 
timeconsuming duplication of efforts the crs handles more than 
1500 requests for information from congress every day 
the researchers discovered that some widely used quotes now 
part of american folklore are impossible to trace to the person 
who first uttered them other quotes have been mistakenly 
attributed to a few legendary orators such as abraham lincoln 
it has never been verified they say that lincoln or pt 
barnum observed that you may fool all the people some of the 
time you can even fool some of the people all the time but you 
cant fool all of the people all the time 
who said winning isnt everything its the only thing the 
library says it wasnt the late vince lombardi but red sanders 
football coach at vanderbilt university 
goodrum said congress no longer produces thundering longwinded 
orators of the likes of daniel webster henry clay or john c 
calhoun and that televisions insatiable hunger for 20second 
sound bites is largely to blame 
todays politicians probably arent as quotable as the 
oldtime orators who spoke in the measured cadences of the bible 
and shakespeare he said even though their quotes dont stand 
up so they can be chiseled on marble as clearly their speeches 
reflect some very incisive thinking about the major issues of our 
time

a 22yearold man who faced execution 
by lethal injection friday for murdering a las vegas store clerk 
during a 1986 robbery won a stay tuesday from a federal judge 
david pellegrini had initially not wanted a stay but changed his 
mind monday assistant federal public defender pat flanagan 
immediately obtained the stay from us district judge phil pro of 
las vegas 
pro told pellegrini he should return to the state courts and 
file any postconviction appeals possible at that level before 
filing any more federal court petitions 
pellegrini was sentenced to die for the slaying of barry 
hancock 27 who was handcuffed and shot in the head 
flanagan sought a stay on grounds a prosecutor improperly 
suggested during a penalty hearing that there could be more victims 
if pellegrini ever got out of prison 
the defender also claimed authorities conducted an illegal 
search of pellegrinis apartment where the murder weapon bullets 
and bloodspattered clothes were found 
the same issues were raised in a state supreme court appeal 
which was rejected last november when the high court held that the 
record provided substantial support for the verdict and the penalty

secretary of state james a baker rejects 
speculation that uscuban relations are about to improve saying 
american policy will not change until cuba ends repression at home 
and unacceptable behavior abroad 
bakers views are outlined in a confidential memo drawn up to 
counter suggestions that cubas pledge in december to withdraw its 
troops from angola will improve the climate between havana and 
washington 
us policy has not changed in the wake of the southern africa 
accords baker said in the memo 
the memo has been distributed to diplomatic posts abroad and to 
selected government agencies the document is dated march 1989 and 
is stamped confidential a copy was made available to the 
associated press on tuesday 
the memo indicates that no changes are planned from the 
hardline cuba policy of the reagan administration under president 
reagan the united states tightened the us trade embargo against 
the island and waged an international campaign against alleged 
human rights abuses by the regime of fidel castro 
no modification of us policy is contemplated in the absence 
of significant changes in cuban repression at home and unacceptable 
behavior abroad inimical to us interests baker said 
baker rejected the arguments of some including senate foreign 
relations committee chairman claiborne pell dri that us 
policy toward cuba over three decades has failed and should be 
changed 
cuba provides the ussr major political strategic and 
intelligence benefits that it otherwise would not have baker 
said 
cuba continues to engage in military adventurism abroad and to 
support subversive movements in the western hemisphere to the 
detriment of peace stability and democratic processes 
further the cuban government persists in its internal 
repression and violation of the basic human rights of its citizens 
cuba has not changed its basic policies 
baker said cuba is involved in a public diplomatic effort to 
reinforce the impression that there will be an improvement in 
relations with the united states he said an end to the trade 
embargo imposed by the united states in 1960 would benefit 
greatly the failed cuban economy and enhance cubas image and 
prestige 
it also would undercut us efforts to encourage other countries 
to maintain economic and political distance from cuba he said 
baker said cuba has steadfastly failed to offer any concrete 
proposals of its own to satisfy longstanding and wellknown us 
concerns 
as described by us officials cuba has demonstrated a more 
accommodating attitude toward the united states over the last 18 
months and there has been an improvement in the ability of the two 
countries to work out differences on nonstrategic issues such as 
immigration 
cuban officials have disclosed that the head of the cuban 
interests section in washington ramon sanchez parodi will be 
replaced shortly by jose antonio arbesu a vice chief of cubas 
america department a party organism that oversees cubas relations 
with other nations in the western hemisphere 
former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said monday 
that the cuban shift indicates a willingness to intensify 
discussions with the united states on issues that have divided the 
two countries 
he noted that arbesu had been instrumental in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement on angola 
but two current state department officials both insisting on 
anonymity said they did not see arbesus appointment as a 
political signal 
sanchez parodi has been in washington since september 1977 and 
is one of the longest serving heads of diplomatic missions in 
washington 
baker said cuba continues to support radical political 
movements and violent subversive groups in latin america 
cuba provides a wide range of support for the fmln insurgent 
armies in el salvador and guerrilla groups in guatemala the 
secretary said 
cuba has close relations with and provides extensive military 
and economic assistance to the sandinista regime in nicaragua 
which in turn provides material support to guerrillas throughout 
central america 
baker added that cuba has exploited american differences with 
panamas government by using the dispute to promote latin american 
solidarity against the united states 
in south america baker said cuba has been supporting 
subversion in chile and colombia and to a lesser extent rebel 
groups in peru and ecuador

the soviet union says us refusal to stop 
arming rebels in afghanistan could lead to a wider conflict in 
southwest asia 
two soviet diplomats at a news conference tuesday urged 
secretary of state james a baker iii to reconsider a soviet 
proposal for a mutual arms embargo 
so far the american side is reluctant to accept our 
proposal oleg derkovsky a counselor at the soviet embassy here 
said 
he said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is likely 
to renew the appeal when baker goes to moscow in may 
derkovsky said fighting between the rebels and the afghan 
government is escalating and could involve india and iran as the 
two countries seek to protect their interests 
the soviet diplomat said the two countries were concerned that 
pakistan might try to arrange a federation with afghanistan should 
the rebels succeed in overthrowing president najibullahs 
government 
people have to be very careful of avoiding incidents that 
could lead to a larger conflict yevgeny kutovoy 
ministercounselor of the embassy said 
the two diplomats accused the united states and pakistan of 
illegally arming the rebels and said the united nations should 
conduct an inquiry and consider posting monitors at the countrys 
borders 
the diplomats also recalled predictions that najibullah would 
collapse like a house of cards after the feb 15 departure of 
soviet troops 
the sovietbacked afghan leader and his army have shown most 
convincingly they are prepared to uphold on their own the countrys 
sovereignty kutovoy said 
soviet troops backed the government in kabul against the 
usarmed rebels for nine years the war has continued since their 
departure 
kutovoy accused pakistan of training and arming rebel forces in 
extensive subversive and terrorist activities to overthrow 
najibullahs government he said pakistani officers were directing 
attacks and that pakistani servicemen have been captured deep 
inside afghanistan 
pakistans involvement calls for a special investigation by the 
united nations and un monitoring of the geneva accords of last 
april which barred outside intervention in the afghan war kutovoy 
said 
at the same time kutovoy and derkovsky criticized the bush 
administration for its decision to maintain us arms shipments to 
the rebels through pakistan 
the us military aid is contradictory to the geneva accords 
and does not help the peaceful solution of the situation in 
afghanistan kutovoy said the continuation of the shipments to 
the parties in afghanistan is a source of the continuation of the 
fratricidal conflict in that country 
derkovsky meanwhile said the soviets are no longer arming 
najibullahs government and that the weapons left behind with the 
departure of soviet troops are not outlawed by the geneva accords 
but he said any supply of weapons to the opposition forces 
in afghanistan through the territory of pakistan is a clearcut 
flagrant violation of the accords 
any weapon coming to afghanistan through pakistan is a 
violation derkovsky said if it comes from heaven its ok if 
it comes through the territory of pakistan no way its a 
violation 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said she 
had no comment on the soviet allegations or on whether the united 
nations should conduct an inquiry

ignoring a new moderation in 
neighboring poland and hungary this countrys communist government 
has silenced or muted voices critical of its rule 
to a flurry of publicity in the west and protest even from the 
east bloc playwright vaclav havel was arrested jan 16 and 
subsequently sentenced to eight months in jail 
at least seven leading activists who are less known abroad but 
important in the emerging younger dissident groups at home have 
also been jailed 
dozens of other critical voices have been muted by what 
dissidents term not only the most sweeping crackdown in a decade 
but a skillful carefully targeted repression 
last year it appeared to other activists that the authorities 
had at last loosened up on charter 77 eastern europes oldest 
human rights movement and were prepared to tolerate a measure of 
more active dissent 
leading activists such as havel and fellow chartist jiri 
dienstbier and jiri ruml began publishing lidove noviny peoples 
news an underground monthly they estimated quickly gained a 
readership of 4000 and even seemed a candidate for legal 
registration 
a year later those hopes are dashed 
underground journals starved of equipment and money cannot 
reach more than a few thousand readers making activists dependent 
on foreign radio stations widely listened to in czechoslovakia 
to spread their news 
our great problem is the problem of information said 
charter 77 signatory ladislav lis the situation has worsened he 
noted with the passage of new laws this month imposing stiff fines 
or jail terms on anyone circulating any documents deemed 
anticommunist 
dissidents see various factors behind the change of tactics by 
the authorities 
one is that the vienna conference reviewing implementation of 
the 1975 helsinki final act has ended at that forum 
czechoslovakia found itself under fire for repression of known 
dissidents 
now the authorities assure western diplomats they will 
implement the vienna accords they appear willing for instance 
to make it easier for millions of citizens to travel to the west 
but are not giving rein to groups they view as anticommunist 
enemies 
probably the biggest factor in the changed tactics is the 
response to mass antigovernment protests that occurred in august 
october and january 
prague a charming city of winding alleys towers and steeples 
is the only capital in europe where riot police appeared on the 
streets six times in five months using tear gas batons dogs 
water cannon and even armored personnel carriers to disperse 
peaceful crowds 
thousands of intellectuals signed at least three different 
petitions to the government protesting the police actions and the 
detention of havel and other dissidents 
the crackdown on known dissenters since has signaled the 
authorities determination not to allow charter 77 a voice in 
politics 
instead an official committee was created in december to 
monitor human rights two officials vladimir flegel and zbynek 
vokrouhlicky said in an interview they have already solved 65 
cases where citizens previously were refused permission to travel 
abroad 
but the committee has not spoken out against the police 
brutality in january and against toughened penalties on violating 
public order an indication of authorities desire to maintain 
control over political and social activity 
yet change could be in the offing 
there have been few if any reprisals against the intellectuals 
who signed the petitions an indication that at least some of the 
countrys communist leaders realize they cannot isolate the brains 
they need to revitalize an increasingly stagnant economy 
a wellinformed source who asked not to be identified reported 
that at a meeting in midmarch senior party leaders and economists 
discussed a plan to open the economy and allow some political 
liberalization 
the plan the work of economist valtr komarek who drew 
attention late last year with highly critical analyses of the 
czechoslovak economy was rejected when first put to party leaders 
last december 
now the source reported it appears to have at least partial 
support from party leader milos jakes who western diplomats 
believe is under some pressure from the kremlin to open up to 
reform

voters on tuesday rejected a proposal to increase 
the sales tax half a penny to finance an 84 billion expansion of 
the growthburdened phoenix areas mass transit system 
with ballots from 923 of 1093 precincts counted the tax 
increase had 114618 votes or 385 percent to 182833 votes or 
615 percent against 
obviously this train is not leaving the station said mayor 
terry goddard 
the 30year tax increase would have paid for a system which had 
been hailed by some as the metropolitan areas salvation from 
traffic jams and hazy skies and condemned by others as a white 
elephant 
county recorder helen purcell had predicted a 30 percent 
turnout or around 265000 registered voters for the vote on 
proposition 300 the seed ballot for the valtrans system 
approval would have raised the sales tax in most of the county 
to 7 percent by july 1 
proposition 300 asked voters to fund a 103mile elevated 
railway 23 miles of rushhour train service along regular tracks 
freeway lanes for multiplepassenger vehicles and a bus system 
expanded from 350 buses to 1500 
the regional public transportation authority had projected a 
44peryear cost to the average household but a study by the 
arizona tax research associations put the cost at 82 to 107 
valtrans was pushed as a way to reduce both air pollution and 
the nations secondhighest rates for auto insurance to unclog 
city streets and to help families get rid of second or third cars 
opponents said phoenix was too spread out for mass transit 
valtrans was the second version of proposition 300 put before 
voters in 3 years 
the first approved by more than twothirds of the voters in 
october 1985 created the rpta to plan for growth it also 
instituted a 20year halfcent sales tax for 231 miles of freeways 
so far three miles have been completed and 22 miles are under 
construction 
rpta planners said valtrans first impact would have been more 
buses and routes beginning in september the 10year rushhour 
train service between chandler and downtown phoenix would have 
begun in 1991 
the initial 24 miles of the lightrail system between glendale 
and tempe would have opened in 1995

president bush has made a few changes to the 
white house grounds but the woodshed out back remains 
you wont find it by the new horseshoe pit bush had installed 
or the beware of dog sign he posted by the rose garden 
the woodshed is invisible fabricated by onetime budget director 
david stockman during a contrite 1981 news conference 
just as stockman claimed he was taken to the woodshed by 
president reagan for his public criticism of the presidents 
economic policies so was white house counsel c boyden gray 
rebuked for publicly raising questions about a dayold bipartisan 
agreement on nicaragua endorsed by the president 
in both cases the dressingdown may have been more for show 
than for real and parallels can be drawn between the two incidents 
gray in an interview with the new york times suggested the new 
agreement with congress on central america diluted the 
constitutional powers of the president 
the statement questioning a presidential decision was highly 
unusual coming from a white house subordinate and the 
reverberations were almost immediate 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked at his 
daily news briefing if gray had yet been to the woodshed over his 
remarks said the official in fact had just met privately on 
that very matter with both bush and chief of staff john sununu 
they had a polite discussion about how things work in the 
white house fitzwater said 
and bush asked for his reaction to grays criticism said 
pointedly i shared my reaction with boyden which is the way i 
handle things 
stockman found himself in hot water when his skepticism about 
the ability of reaganomics to make a dent in the budget deficit 
found its way into an article in the atlantic monthly 
and one of the first people stockman sought out for advice was 
bush according to no less a source than bush himself 
in his 1987 biography looking forward bush said a 
forlorn figure in a dark blue suit showed up at my office seeking 
advice 
it was stockman bush said the youthful budget director told him 
that he believed his comments to writer william greider had been 
off the record which bush said seemed a little naive because 
stockman also told him greider had a tape recorder going 
when dave finished telling his story my advice was that he go 
down to the oval office as soon as possible get an appointment 
with the president and give him the same account hed just given 
me admit youve made a mistake and apologize i advised him 
my thought was that everyones entitled to one mistake bush 
wrote 
stockman in his 1986 book the triumph of politics claims 
he wasnt scolded by reagan in the oval office meeting that 
followed in fact he wrote reagan asked him to stay on saying 
i need your help 
stockman who resigned his white house job four years later saw 
his book become a best seller and went on to become a wall street 
financial consultant said he created the woodshed story to 
appease other white house aides 
stockman said the line about him having been called on the 
carpet by reagan was demanded by an enraged chief of staff james 
a baker iii who told him it was the only way he could save his 
job 
baker now the secretary of state also figures prominently in 
the recent episode 
grays voicing of concerns about the constitutionality of the 
central american agreement marked the second time the white house 
counsel had challenged baker who was the chief architect of the 
accord earlier gray raised conflictofinterest questions about 
stocks baker held in a new york bank because it was a third world 
creditor baker sold his holdings as a result 
any conversation between baker and gray at the woodshed remains 
unreported meanwhile white house officials are taking the flap in 
stride even with a measure of humor 
first of all i want to announce that boyden gray concurs in 
the constitutionality of the easter egg roll fitzwater said at 
the outset of his briefing on woodshed day i checked with him 
myself

federal safety officials are calling for 
tougher drunken driving laws and want the oldest onefifth of the 
nations school buses off the road in response to the united 
states worst alcoholrelated highway accident 
the national transportation safety board ending its inquiry 
into the may 1988 headon collision that killed 24 children and 
three adults aboard a kentucky church bus adopted a long list of 
recommendations for federal and state officials tuesday 
flames spread through the bus after it collided with a pickup 
truck that was going the wrong way on interstate 71 near 
carrollton ky authorities said the pickup driver had a blood 
alcohol content of 26 in tests 90 minutes after the accident and 
a board investigator said tuesday he likely was at 29 when the 
collision occurred which is nearly three times the legal level of 
presumed intoxication 
all 27 deaths aboard the bus which belonged to the first 
assembly of god in radcliff were attributed to smoke inhalation 
the board said forty people escaped most with injuries the bus 
was returning from an amusement park near cincinnati 
the ntsbs acting chairman james l kolstad said the may 14 
collision may be one of the most influential highway accidents 
the board has ever heard 
the board said the accident clearly was caused by the 
alcoholimpaired condition of the pickup truck driver larry 
mahoney 35 of worthville ky who is free on 540000 bail 
awaiting a november trial on 27 counts of murder 
but the board also said characteristics of the 11yearold 
former school bus contributed to the accidents severity the 
vehicles unprotected fuel tank flammable seat covers and a rear 
door partially obstructed by the last row of seats were all noted 
in the report which was adopted after a daylong session 
the ford bus was assembled by shellerglobe corp of toledo 
ohio last july both ford and shellerglobe reached outofcourt 
settlements for undisclosed amounts with families of nearly all the 
victims families neither company admitted any liability 
the board recommended that states set a date for phaseout of 
buses not meeting 1977 federal standards if adopted nationwide 
the rule would affect 77000 school buses about 22 percent of 
those now in use it would also affect thousands of former school 
buses used by church groups and other organizations 
the 1977 standards required strengthened fuel systems stronger 
seats toughened roof and body joints and more accessible exits 
the fivemember board also asked states to toughen their 
drunkendriving laws to allow police to revoke drivers licenses 
to prohibit pleabargaining in drunkendriving cases and to end the 
practice of giving convicted drunken drivers reduced licensing 
penalties if they enroll in treatment programs 
among safety improvements suggested by the ntsb which has no 
enforcement powers and can only recommend actions to other federal 
agencies and the states were making seatcovers out of fire 
retardant material putting more exits on school buses and making 
their fuel tanks more resistant to puncture in severe accidents 
the board noted that a threeinch tear in the fuel tank on the 
kentucky bus led to the fire that engulfed the vehicle 
but the board said it was unclear whether such strengthening 
measures would have prevented the fuel tank rupture which it said 
was probably caused by a spring broken loose in the collision it 
also noted that flameretardant requirements did not change under 
the 1977 rules 
the bus involved in the crash was built two weeks before the 
stiffened federal school bus safety requirements took effect april 
1 1977 
among specific board recommendations were 
that the national highway traffic safety administration require 
more fireretardant material in bus seatcovers 
that school buses be made to meet the same standards for exit 
doors imposed on public transit buses including the installation 
of either more exits or popout windows 
that the safety administration evaluate and revise if 
necessary its standards on the placement of school bus fuel tanks 
plus adding various protective structures around the tanks in 
addition to cages required under the 1977 law 
that the federal highway administration conduct a test of 
increasing the number of wrong way signs on divided highways to 
determine the signs effectiveness in reducing wrongway accidents 
which the board said kill an average of more than 270 people a year 
that church groups and other private organizations purchase 
only buses that meet the post1977 standards 
micky sadoff president of mothers against drunk driving 
praised the recommendations but said she was saddened that the 
board focused more on bus safety than drunken driving 
we wouldnt want to put down bus safety in any way she 
said but added the equivalent of a fully loaded 747 crashing 
every week for a year equals the number of fatalities on our roads 
due to drunk driving 
the board said 51 percent of the 46000 annual fatalities are 
attributable to alcohol use

president bush says proposals to legalize 
narcotics are 180 degrees wrong and the entertainment industry 
should stop depicting drugs as a humorous or harmless diversion 
we have to change the way this problem has been looked at 
the president said tuesday during a questionandanswer session 
with about 100 civic class students at a high school in a virginia 
suburb of washington 
inching further away from his once ironclad opposition to 
tighter gun controls bush also said maybe theres a need for 
more laws to restrict the semiautomatic assaultstyle weapons 
that are used in drugrelated violence 
and he backed away from his earlier support of the proposal for 
a 51 percent pay increase for members of congress an idea that 
died under a tidal wave of public opposition 
in retrospect bush said it was too big a bite at once 
and the country didnt support it at all so to accommodate the 
needs the legitimate needs for a raise it has to be done 
differently 
fielding a question on foreign policy bush said the united 
states is the only country that can be a substantial catalyst for 
peace in the middle east 
bush will hold separats at the white house next week 
with egyptian president hosni mu and israeli foreign minister 
yitzhak shamir we will be probing as best we can and making 
suggestions to them as to what the us can do in trying to bring 
about peace in the middle east bush said 
the president talked with students during a surprise visit to 
james madison high school in the virginia suburb of vienna about 
15 miles from the white house the school had only 90 minutes 
warning he was coming 
to the delight of hundreds of chatting teenagers in the school 
cafeteria bush had lunch with them eating pizza and french fries 
and sipping milk through a straw 
in the school library bush perched on a stool and answered 
questions for 30 minutes 
bemoaning this stupid abuse of drugs bush said that for a 
while in this country it seemed to be we condoned those things we 
should condemn 
and we went through a period where the treatment for example 
of the use of cocaine in movies was done in a humorous vein or some 
kind of well harmless but made the user look like some kind of 
silly idiot he said but nothing condemnatory 
and so weve got to mobilize the entertainment media and say 
look dont put out great emotion in favor of or treat these in 
favor of cocaine or other drugs 
bush said he recognizes that students are under pressure from 
their peers to experiment with drugs he suggested that schools try 
to educate students about the damage that comes from substance 
abuse 
he said that people used to talk about legalizing narcotics 
without naming names he said and that was some very serious 
people and i just think its 180 degrees wrong 
answering a question about international terrorism bush said 
its like dealing with fog you cant get hold of it very well 
in another development bush said he was still seeking 
clarifications from japan on building the advanced fsx jet fighter 
and that efforts to nail down an agreement were going back and 
forth a little 
administration officials said the final goahead on the joint 
project was being delayed by haggling with japan over who will own 
the technology and how many planes would be usbuilt 
it is possible that a japaneseset friday deadline for a final 
decision may be missed said the officials speaking on condition 
of anonymity however officials also sought to dispel the idea 
that the project was unraveling and said a deal was still 
considered likely

dick thornburgh says his thoughts were on 
securing his first state budget when he began the day march 28 
1979 but instead he wound up dealing with the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident 
now us attorney general thornburgh had been pennsylvania 
governor 72 days when a stuck valve at the three mile island plant 
allowed vital cooling water to drain from the unit 2 reactors 
radioactive core 
although the plant was just 10 miles from the capitol in 
harrisburg it could have been on the other side of the planet as 
far as thornburghs understanding of nuclear energy was concerned 
nuclear jargon was like a foreign language to me he said 
tuesday in a speech at the national press club 
still thornburgh was a quick study and is widely credited for 
his calm handling of the accident 
in tuesdays speech as in a speech he gave four years ago at 
duke university thornburgh said he learned that a manager should 
not be afraid to scramble the organization chart as we did during 
three mile island 
he compared his handling of the accident to president kennedy 
during the cuban missile crisis when his own brothers advice 
weighed more heavily with him than that of the secretary of state 
or the joint chiefs of staff 
no one was hurt during the accident although radioactive gas 
was released into the atmosphere and pregnant women and 
preschoolers were advised by thornburgh to evacuate within five 
miles of the plant 
thornburgh said he learned another lesson at tmi respect but 
do not depend on the news media while much of the reporting of 
the accident was reliable he said some was downright 
outrageous 
thornburgh added a postscript to tuesdays speech saying the 
1986 accident at chernobyl that killed at least 31 people might 
have been prevented if the people of the soviet union were as free 
to question their authorities as were americans in 1979 
after tmi thornburgh served a second term as governor beginning 
in 1982 then headed the institute of politics at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government before becoming attorney 
general last august 
on other matters tuesday thornburgh 
said the question of whether special investigations should be 
required for members of congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing 
would be resolved at an early date 
an order signed by thornburghs predecessor edwin meese iii 
called for attorneys general to appoint an independent counsel to 
investigate serious allegations against congressmen and senators 
im no great fan of independent counsels period thornburgh 
said adding that a review of meeses order was nearing completion 
said he was unaware of a contingency plan for any federal 
takeover of the police department in the district of columbia 
which has been plagued by drugrelated murders 
sidestepped a question on the appropriateness of a suit against 
random drug testing filed by executive office employees while 
declining to give an offhand opinion of the suit thornburgh 
said he was encouraged by recent supreme court rulings upholding 
us customs service drug testing and postaccident drug testing by 
railroads 
the validation of drug testing by the supreme court does send 
in my view a very positive signal gives a green light to those 
in the private sector who want to use sound drug testing programs 
to ensure a drugfree workplace he said

the pentagon is preparing claims on behalf of 
the 21 sailors injured in a missile attack on the uss stark now 
that iraq has agreed to compensate the families of the 37 killed in 
the 1987 incident 
the united states also intends to ask iraq for compensation to 
cover the 829 million repair bill for the guided missile frigate 
which was badly damaged when two frenchmade exocet missiles were 
fired at the ship as it steamed through the persian gulf 
we intend to move quickly to file those claims now that iraq 
has agreed to pay 273 million for the dead a defense department 
official said tuesday after the state department announced the 
settlement with iraq 
among the 60 claims still to be filed against iraq are several 
on behalf of two seamen seriously injured in the fiery attack and 
others on behalf of servicemen who suffered light burns and other 
injuries officials said 
the officials said the united states wanted to see the outcome 
of the claim for the dead before submitting those for the survivors 
the government of iraq has undertaken to make prompt payment 
of the full amount said a defense official payments will be 
made to the families as quickly as possible after the receipt of 
the funds 
iraqs agreement to settle the claim was viewed by the state 
department as a good sign said one diplomat further lack of 
progress in the case could have affected relations he added 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states renewed its ties with iraq in 1984 after a 
17year break and has sought to maintain a steady improvement 
despite some tensions 
iraq apologized for the missile attack which occurred at the 
height of the iraniraq tanker war saying the pilot mistook 
the stark for an enemy iranian vessel after an investigation the 
united states accepted the explanation 
the us claim was presented 11 months ago but it took a trip to 
baghdad last week by one of the departments top trouble shooters 
legal adviser abraham sofaer to nudge the iraqis into action 
officials said the american team was called in to see iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz on monday and told that this was what 
iraqi president saddam hussein had decided 
there were no negotiations one source continued they 
just announced this was what they were prepared to pay 
the us team decided it was better to settle for slightly less 
than the original claim of 296 million in order to prevent 
further delays the officials said 
each family will get an average of 740000 according to a 
formula that takes into account the servicemens remaining 
dependents 
after the attack the stark spent several months undergoing 
temporary repairs in bahrain before returning with its surviving 
crew members to their home base in mayport fla near 
jacksonville in august 1987 
the stark later sailed to the shipyard in pascagoula miss 
where it was built for extensive repairs it returned to fleet 
duty in mayport in september 1988 
settlement of the stark compensation brought to mind the 
unsettled claims of 290 victims of another persian gulf attack 
those killed when the uss vincennes mistakenly shot down an iranian 
airliner over the gulf last year 
the united states says it has not gotten specifics about those 
killed and therefore has been unable to determine the compensation 
weve tried a number of channels to obtain information but 
nothing has been accomplished over the past several months said a 
us official speaking on condition of anonymity

a study by the agriculture department says 
that brazil and the united states both have some cost advantages in 
the production of soybeans but that the expenses vary greatly from 
region to region in each country 
brazil is the chief competitor of american farmers in the 
lucrative world soybean market and is expected to harvest a record 
crop this year argentina also has been expanding production 
the united states has a big lead in global soybean output 
producing 419 million metric tons of the worlds 934 million tons 
forecast for the 198889 harvest brazils harvest is currently 
indicated at 21 million tons and argentinas 85 million 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of soybeans 
questions have been raised about costs of production and whether 
american farmers can continue to compete with the growing output in 
the southern hemisphere countries particularly brazil 
the study by the departments economic research service offered 
no final answer to the debate but did pinpoint a number of regional 
cost differences in each country 
for example the study showed that american farmers generally 
have an edge with lower variable costs of production which 
includes expenses for fertilizer weedkillers seeds and labor but 
fixed costs are higher than in brazil those include general 
farm overhead taxes insurance and interest payments 
in the united states using 1986 figures the soybean regions 
with the lowest variable costs are the corn belt lake states and 
northern plains regions with production costs averaging in a range 
50 to 60 per ton those areas account for about 70 percent of the 
us soybean area 
but when the southeast and delta regions are included the 
average variable cost jumps sharply to 110 per ton 
given the substantial portion of us soybean area outside the 
corn beltlake states region use of data from this region alone 
may be inappropriate for making comparisons with brazil and 
argentina the report said 
looking at brazil the analysts noted that the traditional 
soybean area is in the south including the states of rio grande do 
sul santa catarina parana and sao paulo these states accounted 
for about 92 percent of brazils soybean area in 1977 but less 
than 64 percent in 1986 
therefore it is no more correct to talk of the traditional 
region as typical of brazilian production than it is to talk of the 
corn beltlake states region as typical of us production the 
report said 
variable costs of production range from 102 per ton in sao 
paulo to 203 in bahia one of the regions of soybean expansion 
in absolute terms the report said these cost figures 
indicate that brazils cash expenses are high relative to the 
united states and that brazils soybean expansion has occurred 
despite high variable costs of production 
the report added one obvious hypothesis is that the low cost 
of land is driving the expansion of soybeans in brazil

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought 550000 metric tons of us corn for delivery in 
the 198889 marketing year that began on sept 1 the first in 
almost three months 
although moscow has been buying us wheat regularly under an 
export subsidy program it was the first significant corn purchase 
since jan 4 officials said tuesday 
the corn which is not subsidized under the export program is 
scheduled for delivery by sept 30 the end of the sixth year of a 
longterm grain supply agreement between the soviet union and the 
united states 
officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the 
soviets for 198889 to more than 107 million tons additionally 
sales include 4 million tons of wheat 450000 tons of soybeans 
14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons of grain sorghum 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 550000 tons of 
corn would be about 217 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 14 million

bekins co and 11 of its employees were fined 
18250 for making illegal contributions to sen john glenns 1984 
democratic presidential campaign federal records show 
the contributions amounting to 3750 broke the law because 
the company paid the employees for making them according to 
federal election commission records made available tuesday 
corporations are not allowed to contribute to presidential or 
congressional campaigns 
most of the 15 employeecontributors were reimbursed some 
through grossing up of their annual incentive bonuses and some 
through their expense accounts said a report by the commissions 
general counsel some employees who received reimbursement did 
not even know they were reimbursed 
the contributions began after irwin jacobs chairman of bekins 
parent company minstar inc asked bekins president at the time 
albert labinger to solicit contributions for the glenn campaign 
the report said 
jacobs also was a member of the glenn campaigns finance 
committee 
some of those who were asked to give money to the campaign said 
that they felt pressured to do so the commissions report said 
the company agreed to pay a 4000 fine and labinger agreed to 
a 4500 fine and roger lee who was bekins chief financial 
officer at the time agreed to pay a 5000 fine 
ronald hartman the companys general counsel was fined 2000 
and richard morse a vice president for personnel paid a 1000 
fine the commission said seven other employees each agreed to pay 
250 fines 
on a separate matter a political action committee organized to 
support the causes of former president ford agreed to pay a 1500 
fine for accepting 15000 from state organizations that could have 
received the money in ways that are legal at the state level but 
are not allowed in federal campaigns 
the gerald r ford new leadership committee received 5000 
contributions each from the reelection campaign of texas gov bill 
clements the 1986 idaho gubernatorial campaign of david leroy and 
the 1986 campaign of kansas gov mike hayden 
idaho and kansas permit corporations to give money directly to 
political candidates and texas allows individuals to give unlimited 
amounts to candidates the commission said 
in addition to prohibiting corporate contributions to federal 
campaigns the national law also limits individuals to giving no 
more than 1000 per election to any one candidate 
the commission found that the ford committee broke the law by 
mingling that money with cash intended to support candidates for 
federal office 
both the ford case and the bekins case were settled in the past 
few months but the files had remained sealed until tuesday

a man convicted in three slayings won a reprieve 
from death from a federal appeals court 33 hours before he was 
scheduled to become the first person executed by hanging in the 
nation since 1965 
richard bauer a prison administrative assistant said charles 
rodman campbell responded to a letter informing him of the ruling 
by laughing and saying its about time 
a threejudge panel of the 9th us circuit court of appeals on 
tuesday agreed to stay the execution after campbells attorneys 
filed a notice of appeal and briefs with the court earlier in the 
day 
were surprised and disappointed said assistant state 
attorney general james hansen who said the court ruled without 
hearing the states arguments 
we were just getting ready to fax the documents when we got 
the ruling 
even if the appeal fails hansen said the earliest date for 
execution could be a year from now 
campbell had exhausted his bid for a stay in state courts a 
federal appeal was rejected monday by us district judge john 
coughenour in seattle who said he found no merit in campbells 
claim that his trial lawyers ineffectively represented him 
i am very very pleased said defense attorney al lyon 
that goes without saying it has been a lot of late late 
nights 
campbell had been scheduled to hang just after midnight thursday 
morning at washington state penitentiary in walla walla 
he would have been the first person executed by hanging in the 
united states since kansas put four men to death in 1965 including 
richard eugene hickock and perry edward smith whose story was told 
in truman capotes book in cold blood 
hanging is washingtons official form of execution although a 
prisoner may opt for lethal injection campbell so far has decided 
not to choose injection 
campbell 34 was convicted of three counts of aggravated 
firstdegree murder for the 1982 throat slashings of renae 
wicklund 31 her 8yearold daughter shannah and a neighbor 
barbara hendrickson 51 
at the time of the killings campbell was on workrelease from a 
prison sentence for a sexual assault on ms wicklund in 1976 she 
and mrs hendrickson had testified at his trial in 1978 
the last person executed in washington state was joseph chester 
self hanged june 20 1963 for killing a seattle cab driver he 
was the 73rd man executed in state history 
campbell is one of seven men on washingtons death row

nasa officials say they are sticking with 
plans for a 15 billion rocket development program rejecting a 
recommendation that the money should instead be directed toward 
improvements in t 
the aerospace safety advisory panel said in its annual report 
released tuesday that the ntics and space 
administration should abandon plans to build an advanced solid 
rocket motor because the money could be better uke 
improvements in the orbiter stage of the space shuttle 
but nasa administrator james c fletcher said development of the 
advanced rocket had been thoroughly debated within the space agency 
and i avent changed my mind on that 
fletcher develop a second source manufacturer 
for space shuttle solid rockets so the agency is never again left 
without a reliable rocket engine as it was after the challenger 
accident in 1986 
we dont want to be stuck with the situation we got stuck with 
before said fletcher we need to have the option of changing

wednesday while share prices rose to a new high on the tokyo stock 
exchange 
the dollar closed at 13325 yen up 035 yen from tuesdays 
13290yen finish the currency opened at 13350 yen and moved in a 
range between 13310 yen and 13350 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
79396 points tuesday to score the largest singleday gain this 
year added another 43092 points or 133 percent to finish 
trading at 3273728 yet another high 
the markets main index continued to rise after tuesdays sharp 
gain boosted by a strong buying mood dealers said 
investors have been buying stocks actively since tuesday which 
marked the start of the new business year when a rise in buy 
orders is common said one dealer with a major securities firm 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
on the foreign exchange market traders said the dollar was 
bullish despite joint intervention overnight by the us and 
western european central banks to halt the currencys recent rise 
although there was no incentive to buy the yen the dollar was 
lower toward the end of wednesdays morning session due to 
dollarselling by speculative investors looking for a profit said 
a trader with the bank of tokyo also speaking anonymously 
another trader said the dollar was unlikely to keep rising 
because participants have begun speculating that the finance 
ministry and the bank of japan will call for dollarselling and 
prepare to intervene in the market 
finance minister tatsuo murayama indicated possible central bank 
intervention early wednesday at a press conference after a special 
cabinet meeting and repeated his comments tuesday that the current 
yendollar rate should be viewed with caution 
the yenselling trend has been widely attributed to the ongoing 
recruit stock trading scandal 
on tuesday tokyo prosecutors arrested a second public official 
former vice minister of education kunio takaishi in connection 
with the scandal bringing to 13 the number arrested to date 
recruit co a fastgrowing informationservice conglomerate

aminullah was playing near the airport 
when a blazing point of light descended from the sky and burned his 
face arms and legs 
the device doctors say will leave aminullah scarred for life was 
one of the thousands of flares unleashed daily by airplanes over 
kabul to deflect the heatseeking missiles fired by anticommunist 
guerrillas 
the flares which arc out of the sky trailing a plume of white 
smoke are a common sight as much a part of the kabul panorama as 
the snowcapped mountains surrounding the city of mudbrick houses 
and open sewers 
but they are still a mystery to aminullah and his mother gul 
babu a widow with three other children 
there is no special warning program about the flares said 
dr lal mohammad who attends burn victims at the indira gandhi 
childrens hospital we tell the women who bring their children 
here to spread the word to the others 
he said as many as six children are admitted each week to the 
gandhi hospital with severe burns caused by the flares that are 
fired or dropped by afghan military and civilian planes and soviet 
cargo planes no statistics are available on the total number of 
flare victims in the kabul area 
aminullah who like many afghans does not use a family name sat 
on a table in the burn ward his arms held stiffly in front of him 
as doctors applied solutions 
the top half of his face from the scalp to the bridge of his 
nose was a brown crust with glistening red cracks burned tissue 
had been removed from his cheeks and chin which were a translucent 
pink 
he cried as a doctor snipped at flaps of dangling burn tissue 
eight other children in the room had similar burns and were 
varying states of recovery 
mohammad said most of the flare victims suffered seconddegree 
burns and their wounds usually were not lifethreatening 
but to be a child in afghanistan is not easy even in peacetime 
according to the united nations childrens fund 30 percent of 
all children born in the country die before the age of five 
diseases claim most of the youngsters 
in 1960 when there was relative peace in this nation of 
constant political and tribal feuds harsh winters and 75 percent 
illiteracy the child mortality rate was 38 percent 
governmentoperated television shows the children of war almost 
every night as it denounces the usbacked guerrillas who are 
fighting to overthrow the marxist government of president najib 
the decadeold war has claimed an estimated one million lives 
from the prewar population of 15 million 
the government seldom fails to say that victims of a guerrilla 
attack included many women and children 
on sunday the government said the guerrillas had rocketed a bus 
on the jalalabadkabul highway killing all the passengers 
including women and children no death toll was given but 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said the bus was 
carrying at least 22 people 
amani said monday an unknown number of the passengers survived 
but no death toll was given 
on tuesday foreign reporters were taken to the gandhi hospital 
to see survivors of the attack 
hospital staffers said they were treating two survivors 
10yearold shafiullah and abbasi 4 but adult victims were taken 
to other hospitals the total number of dead and injured was not 
known 
shafiullah and abbasi received shrapnel wounds in their legs 
according to dr ashraf head of the 250bed hospitals orthopedic 
section 
shafiullah was whimpering into the pillow the doctor said he 
had just learned that his mother and two brothers died in the 
attack 
ashraf said abbasis uncle and cousin were killed 
relatives of the victims said the boys were not on a bus 
instead one said they were riding in a convoy of trucks carrying 
people out of jalalabad where the guerrillas have been besieging 
government forces for three weeks

president roh taewoo ordered 49 top 
generals transferred or retired after army hardliners criticized 
him for seeking ties with communist nations and not suppressing 
dissidents officials said today 
roh a former general who played a key role in the militarys 
seizure of power in 1980 replaced several hardliners in key 
security posts with generals loyal to him according to korean 
press reports 
many of the generals being replaced were allies of former 
authoritarian president chun doohwan 
defense ministry officials said a major shuffle had been ordered 
in the armys high command but would not elaborate declining to 
say how many of the 49 generals would be retired or moved to other 
posts 
details of the shakeup appeared today in all seoul newspapers 
which also said a further shakeup of the armys divisional 
commanders was expected to be announced in coming weeks donga 
ilbo a leading national newspaper said a cabinet shuffle was also 
expected 
in a separate development the national news agency yonhap 
reported that the heads of at least two south korean intelligence 
agencies may be fired for failing to prevent a visit to communist 
north korea by a top dissident leader 
the military shakeup expected to be carried out in april came 
after reports that hardliners in the government and military were 
unhappy with what they saw as rohs failure to curb antigovernment 
radicals and his drive to build ties with communist countries 
several of the changes involve key security commands in seoul 
which are seen as vital to defending the government against any 
internal military threat the army has been a major force in south 
korean politics and twice seized power in the nations 40year 
history 
opposition parties said the shakeup would prevent the military 
from meddling in politics kim daejungs party for peace and 
democracy said hardliners had been trying to deter the militarys 
political neutrality 
roh who won presidential elections in december 1987 has 
attempted to pursue a moderate policy and helped introduce broad 
democratic reforms but the government has not won the broad 
support roh has sought 
roh announced march 20 that he was indefinitely postponing a 
promised referendum on his tenure charging that leftist radicals 
were attempting to stage a revolution he also ordered a major 
crackdown on the radical groups to end a spate of violent protests 
but some political observers said it was unclear if roh could 
have won the referendum and a defeat would probably have forced him 
to call new elections 
indications of the hardliners unhappiness with roh had been 
increasing in recent weeks a leading cabinet hardliner 
administration minister kim yongkap resigned this month after 
criticizing the government as not adequately suppressing 
antigovernment dissidents 
then last week the commandant of the countrys military 
academy lt gen min byongdon failed to salute roh at annual 
graduation ceremonies and made a speech criticizing government 
efforts to establish ties with communist nations 
min is among generals to be retired under the shuffle 
newspapers said 
such staunchly anticommunist generals are reportedly unhappy 
with rohs drive to build political and trade relations with 
communist nations so as to east the confrontation with north korea 
the south korea has never had relations with communist nations 
this week senior generals issued an unprecedented statement 
demanding that leading dissident moon ikhwan be punished for 
making an illegal visit to north koreamoon reportedly met monday 
with north korean leader kim il sung to discuss reuniting the two 
koreas 
the two koreas are bls and kim il sung ordered the 
1950 invasion that started the kan war the seoul government

more than 5000 palestinian 
fighters are massing in southern lebanon in a major buildup that 
could threaten israeli settlements near the border israeli 
military commanders say 
the officers spoke to journalists visiting israelis 
selfdesignated security zone on tuesday when palestinian fighters 
blew up an israeli outpost and a second guerrilla squad was 
reported captured in the zone 
lebanese police said a remotecontrolled explosion leveled a 
twostory building used by the israeli army and its allied militia 
known as the south lebanon army on the eastern edge of the israeli 
buffer zone 
a police spokesman said two sla militiamen were injured and an 
armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the blast at the 
zumarraya crossing point into the israeli zone 18 miles north of 
the lebanese town of hasbaya 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under standing rules 
said guerrillas of the radical plo faction democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine were responsible 
israeli officials described the target as a bunker and said only 
one sla militiaman was injured in the blast 
israeli military commanders said palestinian fighters were 
staging a major buildup just north of the israelicontrolled zone 
brig gen nehamiya tamari commander of troops stationed along 
the 100milelong israeli border estimated the number of 
guerrillas to be about 5000 of whom about 600 to 700 were in 
refugee camps around the lebanese city of tyre 
the importance is not their numbers whether its 5000 or 
6000 but the type of threat that they pose he said if they 
make it hard for people to live in northern israel we will have 
to make some kind of decision about an operation 
other commanders also referred to the palestinian threat and 
said that in the past three months 29 guerrillas were killed in 10 
attempts to infiltrate israel 
israeli sources who spoke on condition of anonymity suggested 
that a successful palestinian attack on civilians across the border 
could prompt israels army to launch a ground operation to uproot 
the palestinians in the tyre area 14 miles north of the border 
capt avi hai an israeli officer who briefed the journalists 
also warned of possible retaliation by israels army 
the idf israel defense force will hit and hit hard 
palestinian centers if these centers will turn into a threat to the 
northern border he said 
israel invaded south lebanon in 1978 to drive out palestine 
liberation organization guerrillas and in 1982 staged a major 
invasion north to beirut to force plo chief yasser arafat from his 
power base in lebanon 
the 1982 war in lebanon led to a threeyear occupation of the 
lebanese south which ended in 1985 with israel creating the sixto 
10mile zone to protect its northern settlements 
tuesdays tour of the region was the first such armysponsored 
trip in more than six months reporters traveled in four trucks 
guarded by two armored personnel carriers four jeeps and a 
truckload of soldiers 
at ras albayada the entrance to the security zone on the coast 
six miles from the border israeli officials displayed the weapons 
carried by the two guerrillas captured tuesday near the town of 
bint jbail 
included were two usmade antitank weapons two sovietmade 
ak47 assault rifles nine clips of ammunition and three hand 
grenades 
israel radio said one of the captured guerrillas was a member of 
arafats fatah plo faction and the other belonged to the 
syrianbased democratic front for the liberation of palestine 
on a mountain ridgeline west of ras albayada an israeli 
officer identified only as lt col udi pointed out the sprawling 
rashadiya refugee camp near tyre where he said many palestinian 
guerrillas were hiding 
he said the guerrillas lacked the longrange artillery needed to 
strike either the security zone or israel itself israels northern 
army commander maj gen yossi peled said only one rocket attack 
against israel had been reported so far this year compared to 26 
last year and 80 in 1986 
the largest weapons the guerrillas have are 107mm katyusha 
rockets and 60mm heavy mortars neither of which could span the six 
miles separating his outpost from the guerrilla camp udi said 
in order for them to strike us they would have to advance out 
of their camps said udi standing behind a coil of barbed wire 
at the edge of a deep jagged ravine that provided a natural 
barrier to any attack

the soviet unions leading young chess player 
and his father have met with an fbi official and asked for 
political asylum according to a grandmaster and fellow soviet 
defector who aided them 
gata kamsky 14 and his father rustam kamsky sought asylum 
tuesday and were staying in the new york area said grandmaster lev 
alburt a former us chess champion who defected from the soviet 
union a decade ears ago 
world champion garri kasparov and other experts have said kamsky 
is likely to reach the highest echelons of world chess 
america finally has a potential supergrandmaster who five 
years from now could challenge for the world championship said 
larry parr a former editor of chess life and review 
gata kamsky was the youngest member of a prominent soviet chess 
delegation participating in the new york open tournament which 
ended tuesday 
his decision was made in my judgment even before he came 
here alburt said it was finalized while he was here when i 
learned about his plans i called the jamestown foundation in 
washington and they brought me in touch with a person in the fbi in 
new york he interviewed them before the game and offered 
protection 
after speaking with the fbi official kamsky who tied for first 
place in the championship of leningrad two years ago went on to 
beat patrick wolff an american international master in the final 
round 
alburt 43 said the other soviet players at the tournament were 
unaware the kamskys were about to defect 
the jamestown foundation founded in 1983 promotes highlevel 
defections from the soviet union and provides career counseling and 
other help to defectors alburt said it had helped with the 
defection of arkady shevchenko the former soviet representative at 
the united nations 
the chief of the soviet delegation alexander roschal a 
prominent chess journalist was not at the tournament site when the 
news broke 
a member of the delegation said on condition of anonymity that 
kamsky had always been treated well by the soviet sports 
authorities 
i cant understand why his father did this the soviet said 
alburt said kamskys parents were divorced and his father had 
remarried they hoped the elder kamskys second wife would 
eventually gain permission to join them in the united states he 
said 
since the formation of the international chess federation in 
1948 and the creation of the modern world championship seven of 
the eight titleholders have been soviet the exception was american 
bobby fischer who became champion in 1972 but refused to defend 
his title in 1975 and has never competed since 
kamsky joins a celebrated list of leading soviet and east 
european chess players who have defected to the west 
they include viktor korchnoi a former world championship 
finalist who lives in and plays for switzerland alburt and 
international master igor ivanov canadas secondranked player 
in august romanias top player grandmaster mihai suba was 
granted political asylum in london during a competition he 
competed in new york with a union jack by his board 
other leading soviet players have emigrated legally or left in 
other ways 
former world champion boris spassky who lost his championship 
crown to fischer married a moscowbased french diplomat and now 
represents that country 
in november in salonica greece elena akhmylovskaya the soviet 
unions second highest ranked woman player eloped with the captain 
of the american mens team john donaldson and now lives with him 
in seattle

chinas leading law officials today drew a bleak 
picture of a nation beset by rising violent crime rampant 
profiteering in scarce goods official corruption and increased 
juvenile delinquency 
in annual reports to the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature the officials also acknowledged thousands of instances 
where false confessions were extracted through torture or frameups 
ren jianxin president of the supreme peoples court said 
chinese courts sentenced 368790 people last year 13 percent more 
than 1987 
in sharp contrast courts acquitted just 2039 defendants 
ren said 113533 convicted offenders were sentenced to death or 
prison terms of five years to life he said 101 embezzlers and 
bribetakers were sentenced to death or life in prison 
china does not give specific figures for executions although 
the number is believed to be well over 1000 a year 
ren said murder cases in 1988 were up 91 percent robbery cases 
431 percent and cases of serious larceny 638 percent he did not 
give a breakdown of the crimes 
while public order is generally stable across the country 
many problems and unstable factors still remain he said he 
called for heavy blows against those who gravely jeopardize 
public order 
despite harsh punishments china has been plagued by a crime 
wave in recent years resulting from greater social mobility less 
government controls over peoples lives and growing income 
disparities as the nation switches to a marketoriented economy 
liu fuzhi the countrys chief prosecutor said his offices 
arrested 8777 on charges of corruption and handled 40000 cases of 
infringement of peoples rights by government officials or law 
enforcement officers a rise of 78 percent from 1987 
among these there were 4700 cases where police were guilty of 
extortion torture frameups and unlawful detentions liu said 227 
cases led to disability and death 
ren also said youths between the ages of 14 and 18 accounted for 
89 percent of convicted offenders in 1988 up 138 percent 
he said there were 74923 convictions for economic offenses such 
as profiteering in scarce or pricecontrolled goods hoarding 
scarce commodities and reselling prized imports like autos and 
stereos for big profits

actress kim basinger has purchased 
braselton from the family that founded it in 1876 and a real 
estate broker said she might establish a movie production company 
in the tiny northeast georgia town 
herbert b braselton sr said tuesday that his family agreed to 
sell 1800 acres of property including the towns industrial 
park shopping center and bank for 20 million to miss basinger 
a native of nearby hart county 
the deals closing will come later this year braselton said 
ive worked with kim on this for quite some time about 18 
months said charles morris the braselton real estate broker who 
handled the deal 
morris said miss basinger has expressed an interest in 
developing braselton into a tourist center and possibly 
establishing a movie production company 
attempts to contact miss basinger and her representatives were 
unsuccessful tuesday 
braselton a town of 500 people about 40 miles north of atlanta 
has been virtually controlled by the braselton family since william 
harrison braselton founded it in 1876 
the property first was offered for sale five years ago for 14 
million but the price jumped after chateau elan winery and a 
mitsubishi plant located in the area 
were relieved we found somebody we think will do good for the 
community herbert braselton said there were tears shed this 
morning when we told the employees we hate to divest ourselves of 
a longtime loved entity but it has to happen weve all gotten 
old and its time for younger people to take over 
he said the family wanted to sell because most of the braseltons 
are elderly and none of the younger family members wanted to hold 
onto the land 
but they had turned down numerous offers for the town he said 
the primary difficulty was the terms braselton said 
people wanted 40 years to pay to people in their 70s and 80s 
that doesnt interest them we got a cash deal 
the 34yearold miss basinger grew up in athens but left at age 
17 for new york city to become a model from there she went into 
acting starring in such movies as the natural and 9 
weeks she also stars in the soontobereleased film batman

an assailant who tried to have his victim 
kept alive on a lifesupport system said he will not appeal a 
judges decision rejecting his request even though he may face a 
murder charge as a result 
noel pagan of wellesley mass wanted to prevent mark weavers 
mother from removing the feeding tube that has kept weaver alive 
since a 1985 stabbing in lewiston pagan 29 served three years in 
prison for aggravated assault but still could face a murder charge 
when weaver dies 
probate court judge dana childs ruled tuesday that pagan could 
not intervene in the case because his interest in preventing 
weavers death has nothing to do with the familys request that 
weaver die peacefully 
mr pagans only claim to being an interested party stems from 
the possibility that when mark weaver suffers death following the 
withdrawal of treatment pagan may be charged with mark weavers 
murder the judge wrote 
weavers mother sylvia lane said she would proceed with plans 
to remove the feeding tube thursday 
weaver 26 has been kept alive with the tube for nearly four 
years since his stab wounds left him in a vegetative state 
lane said she was pleased with the judges decision tuesday 
because it was her sons wish that he not be kept alive 
artificially 
i dont see how he pagan had any right to decide what 
happens to his victim she said 
pagans attorney robert mullen said he had told his client 
that an appeal would mean the case would drag out for months and 
i couldnt tell him when it was going to stop 
he said pagan had agreed that it was in nobodys interest to 
appeal the ruling 
the attorney generals office said it will not decide whether to 
file charges until after the death 
until theres a death theres no cause of death spokesman 
david cheever said tuesday 
state deputy attorney general fernand larochelle said monday 
that pagan could be charged with murder if weaver dies because it 
would not be the same crime as assault the constitution protects 
defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same offense

a world war ii veteran who got tired of 
waiting for housing officials to clean away swastika grafitti in 
his building has been charged with criminal mischief for painting 
over the symbols police said today 
jack stahl a 25year resident of the hillside housing project 
said he made complaints for seven months about the grafitti to the 
citys housing authority but he said nothing was done to remove or 
cover the swastikas 
a police official said today the charge was lodged against stahl 
in december by the housing agency and that stahl was due in 
municipal court on thursday 
if convicted he could be sentenced to a maximum six months in 
prison and a 1000 fine the new york daily news reported today 
stahl a 59yearold truck dispatcher said he decided to paint 
over the nazi symbols himself because he was touched by the 
reaction of an elderly jewish resident to seeing a swastika in an 
elevator 
i said why are you crying stahl said 
she pointed to the swastika and said a relative of hers had 
died in the holocaust i could see how she hurt said stahl who 
according to the newspaper is not jewish 
enough is enough after being yessed to death by housing 
authority officials who promised to take care of the problem for 
seven months i decided i had to take the matter into my own 
hands he said 
stahl said that about 20 minutes after painting over swastikas 
in the elevator and in an eighth floor hallway someone slipped a 
notice under his door ordering him to report to the housing 
authority office 
he said he was met there by by virgilio cabello the housing 
authority director who told him he would face charges 
cabellos secretary told the newspaper he had no comment

a medical equipment manufacturer has pleaded guilty 
to criminal charges of selling thousands of defective pacemakers 
and corrosive batteries and has agreed to pay 764000 in penalties 
cordis corp which last week agreed to pay 5 million to settle 
a separate civilfraud claim brought by the government pleaded 
guilty tuesday to 12 felony counts and 13 misdemeanors in the 
second case 
four executives of the miamibased concern still face a criminal 
trial set for september over the defective pacemakers 
cordis which sold its pacemaker division in 1987 was accused 
of distributing 2200 faulty pacemakers and 6000 batteries prone 
to corrosion between december 1983 and october 1985 
charges filed by the us food and drug administration claimed 
the pacemakers which are planted under the skin to regulate 
heartbeat could stop without warning but no reports of medical 
emergencies are known because of the cordis devices 
negotiations for the plea began last year between the justice 
department and cordis a first accord between the two sides was 
rejected last october by us district judge stanley marcus 
the companys offer to plead guilty to 24 counts and pay 
264000 in fines and costs was insufficient marcus said at the 
time 
but marcus accepted the new deal which included another felony 
charge with a 500000 penalty for intent to defraud the fda by 
failing to provide required notice of the devices adverse field 
reports 
sentencing in the criminal case against cordis was set for april 
25 marcus is not bound by the restrictions of the plea agreement 
the 5 million settlement the company agreed to last week came 
in a civil claim by the veterans administration the va sought 
reimbursement for an undisclosed number of the defective pacemakers 
it had bought 
the justice department said tuesdays civil settlement was one 
of the largest medicare recoveries ever 
according to cordis lawyer daniel g hall the company had paid 
1 million towards its settlement before tuesdays agreement he 
said the remaining penalty plus interest would be paid within three 
years 
cordis sold its pacemaker business to the australian medical 
device manufacturer telectronics cordis now concentrates on making 
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for 
monitoring pressure on the brain 
the company reported net losses of 561 million in 1987 but a 
major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation 
brought the company net earnings for 1988 of 24 million from 
sales of 132 million

ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis dismissal 
of his designated successor and the resignation of two key foreign 
ministry officials indicates a resurgence of radical fundamentalism 
in the islamic republic 
the removal of ayatollah hussein ali montazeri leaves open who 
will succeed khomeini now 88 and ailing when he dies 
by dumping the 64yearold montazeri as his political and 
religious heir khomeini has moved to curb socalled liberal 
figures in the tehran hierarchy and strengthen the hand of 
hardliners led by interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi 
the political future of parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
leader of the socalled pragmatists is also now in question 
montazeri who has in recent weeks openly criticized the 
shortcomings of the islamic revolution and called for greater 
freedoms announced his resignation tuesday after khomeini asked 
him to step down 
he wrote to khomeini the survival and stability of the 
islamic republic rests on obeying your orders 
montazeris removal and the resignations of deputy foreign 
minister mohammad javad larijani and un ambassador mohammad 
jaafar mahallati in recent days took place against the backdrop of 
a determined drive by khomeini to swing iran back to radical 
fundamentalism 
he has sought to revitalize flagging revolutionary fervor in 
postwar iran by confronting the west over salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses which many moslems consider blasphemous 
khomeinis actions also served the purpose of seriously damaging 
efforts by rafsanjani and foreign minister ali akbar velayati to 
rebuild bridges with the west and end irans isolation 
these events have dealt a serious blow to efforts to ease irans 
political religious and social restrictions following the aug 20 
ceasefire in the costly eightyear war with iraq 
it also effectively robs the liberal faction of one of its most 
influential figures 
montazeri has recently been aligning with mehdi bazargan leader 
of the freedom movement irans token opposition which has been 
largely stifled for several years 
bazargan the republics first prime minister who resigned over 
the takeover of the us embassy in november 1979 has said that 
under moves to permit political parties he plans to expand his tiny 
movement nationwide and even field a candidate in the presidential 
race if circumstances permit 
there has long been speculation that iran would likely be ruled 
by a triumverate of key leaders including rafsanjani after 
khomeini dies with montazeri little more than a figurehead 
eighteen months ago khomeini rewrote his political will to be 
opened after his death heightening speculation he sought to 
diminish montazeris powers in the succession 
montazeris recent criticism of the revolutions achievements 
while the country celebrated the republics first decade the late 
shah mohammad reza pahlavi was ousted in 1979 came amid an 
intensifying power struggle between rafsanjani and the hardliners 
montazeri initially rejected khomeinis order that moslems seek 
out and kill rushdie but later came out in support the religious 
decree 
khomeini apparently at rafsanjanis urging unconditionally 
accepted a july 1987 un security council ceasefire resolution 
after wavering for almost a year 
ending the war was a major boost for rafsanjani and his allies 
khomeini proclaimed his death sentence on rushdie feb 14 the 
day after rafsanjani announced he would run in the presidential 
elections a move the hardliners saw as a bid by the speaker for 
supreme power in the postkhomeini era 
whether coincidence or not khomeinis action was a serious blow 
to rafsanjani 
president ali khameneis second fouryear term expires in 
september under the constitution he cannot run for a third term

fishermen sporting black armbands told 
oil industry federal and state officials that they fear their 
livelihood the prince william sound fishery may be imperiled by 
the nations largest oil spill 
john booren who fishes in the sound said fishermen know this 
years catch will fetch little money even if oil damage is 
contained 
just the publicity will destroy the market for the areas fish 
he said 
a high school gymnasium which is the largest meeting place in 
this town of 2500 was packed tuesday night as fishermen many 
with families in tow voiced their anger and apprehensions 
some of the oldtimers tell me this is the biggest crowd 
theyve seen here since the town turned out to protest the 
pipeline city manager don moore said 
the town opposed construction of the 800mile transalaska oil 
pipeline in the 1970s moore said 
he spoke in a hallway as a state fish and game official offered 
yet more bad news on the spread of oil from a grounded tanker that 
leaked 240000 barrels of crude into the sea friday 25 miles from 
port valdez cordova is about 50 miles to the southeast 
moore said many fishermen are bitter because their initial 
offers to help contain the spill went unanswered 
he said alyeska pipeline service co which has the 
responsibility for immediate response to oil spills in the sound 
had issued emergency telephone numbers prior to the spill 
when our fishermen called to offer assistance nobody would 
answer the phone at alyeska he said the company has said some 
employees were off in observance of good friday the day of the 
spill 
the fishermen now are taking the lead in trying to protect 
sensitive areas including three fish hatcheries on islands in the 
sound 
i want you to know that we are not going to be able to stop 
much of the damage said dennis kelso the state commissioner of 
environmental conservation this is a very serious spill and a 
very environmentally complex area 
alyeska president george nelson and exxon spokesman don cornett 
were treated with relative restraint by the crowd 
whats your way of life worth to you a woman shouted at 
cornett 
not very much tonight he replied 
cornett said he would not try to duck legitimate damage claims 
filed by fishermen hurt by the spill 
steve zimmermann of the national marine fisheries service said 
many sea otters will suffer from the spill but that news was 
greeted with applause 
fishermen have complained the otter population has reached an 
intolerable level they say the animals eat fish otherwise 
available for harvest by the fishing fleet so they expressed 
pleasure when zimmerman said 
some of them are going to go to sea otter heaven in the next 
few days

a fertilized egg experiment aboard 
the recent discovery flight raised more questions than it answered 
after half of them returned dead the shuttles pilot says 
the experiment included 16 chicken eggs fertilized two days 
before the march 13 blastoff and another 16 fertilized nine days 
prior to launch 
although all of the older eggs hatched saturday the others were 
found dead when the shuttle returned march 18 both the hatched 
chicks and the dead ones are being studied to determine how 
weightlessness affected them 
what looked like a very simple experiment may turn out to have 
generated thousands of questions now instead of providing any 
answers to anything discovery pilot john blaha said tuesday at a 
news conference its certainly a great mystery as to why this 
happened 
dr james bagian another astronaut on the flight said the 
experiment raised questions as to whether plant or animal life can 
begin in zero gravity 
bagian said the chicken eggs and another experiment in which he 
observed plant growth were designed to determine if cell division 
is somehow impeded or mutated by a lack of gravity 
is there a certain point in the differentiation of cell types 
where they are vulnerable to the effects of the loss of gravity 
maybe gravity plays up to now an unknown role but a very essential 
role in that the older ones eggs at nine days are past that 
crucial gate if you will and they are developing normally 
bagian said 
if the experiment shows that life cannot begin anew in 
orbit that would have great implications for long space stays in 
the future bagian said 
you may have to supply a gravity environment for a period of 
time 
during the flight the crew which also consisted of commander 
michael coats and astronauts james f buchli and robert springer 
took 3000 still photographs and shot nearly three miles of movie 
film in an effort to document environmentally damaged areas of the 
earth 
on tuesday the crew showed several spectacular views they 
captured including shots of a sunset sri lanka the caribbean sea 
and the himalayas but they also talked about how deforestation 
air and water pollution and the effects of droughts can be observed 
from space 
i think all of us that have flown come back with a very 
protective feeling about our planet said coats all of us come 
back i think with a renewed appreciation of the fact that weve 
got to protect this planet theres no place else to go

the communist party newspaper pravda today called 
the parliamentary elections in which party leaders lost in the 
soviet unions three largest cities a victory for reform efforts 
voters did not simply vote like it was earlier but they 
really made a choice giving their preference to candidates whose 
preelection platforms suited them better pravda said 
choosing peoples deputies the country voted for perestroika 
while official results of sundays balloting for 1500 seats in 
the congress of peoples deputies parliament will not be released 
for days party and government officials in moscow leningrad and 
kiev were voted out by a frustrated public as were at least 37 
local officials around the country 
one loser was yuri solovyev a nonvoting member of the ruling 
politburo who was running unopposed in leningrad 
the losses could actually benefit soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev because the balloting emphasizes voters frustrations 
with their local party leadership and desires for further reforms 
there were notable winners including telman gdlyan a federal 
investigator who headed the embezzlement and corruption cases 
against officials in the soviet central asian republic of 
uzbekistan the official news agency tass said today 
gdlyans platform included a toughening of the soviet unions 
criminal codes tass reported gdlyan captured 87 percent of the 
vote in a race against four other candidates the news agency said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a 
news briefing tuesday that the losses could not be considered a 
defeat for the communist party because about 80 percent of party 
members won their races 
but he said local party organizations would have to review why 
party members lost 
reports from the byelorussian capital minsk and from armenia 
two areas where there has been tension over citizens demands for 
reform indicated voters rejected top leaders or just stayed away 
from the polls 
pravda said the city party leader in minsk v galko and a 
first deputy premier of the republic y khusainov failed their 
election bids voters also rejected communist party leaders of the 
gomel and mogilev regions two southern areas affected by the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear disaster 
many citizens of minsk were angered last fall by tough police 
action against groups seeking to build a memorial to the victims of 
stalins purges and a nascent peoples front grassroots 
organization 
in armenia voters stayed away from the polls to voice their 
frustration with a lack of choice the government newspaper 
izvestia said tuesday 
at the very climax of the campaign people asked a question for 
which they did not receive a convincing answer izvestia said 
why did a group of leaders of the republic nominated as 
candidates have no opponents and many as a sign of protest 
refused to take part in elections without a choice 
in many parts of the soviet union 8595 percent of the voters 
participated but in armenia the figure was 72 percent and only 53 
percent of the voters of the earthquakedevastated capital yerevan 
went to the polls 
armenia has been the site of frequent turmoil since february 
1988 when a dispute arose with neighboring azerbaijan over control 
of the nagornokarabakh region

an embassy spokeswoman said the attack occurred late tuesday and 
that mccarthy was in the bomb shelter the residence in the 
christian yarze district is midway between the presidential palace 
and the defense ministry 
meanwhile a ceasefire declared today by christian army 
commander gen michel aoun after three weeks of fierce artillery 
clashes with syrian troops and their moslem militia allies

376 wounded since march 8 when beiruts worst civil war clashes in 
four years broke out 
aouns headquarters said syrian gunners were shelling the 
presidential palace the defense ministry and neighboring 
residential districts in christian east beirut 
aoun who heads a christian military cabinet in lebanons dual 
government said he ordered his 20000 troops to stop shooting at 
midnight in response to an appeal from the arab league 
there was no public response from the syrian command or druse 
warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party militia 
aouns main adversaries in the latest round of lebanons 14year 
civil war between christians and moslems 
a communique issued by aouns headquarters said despite the 
armys adherence to the ceasefire the syrian batteries poured 
shells on eastern christian areas as people were emerging from 
bomb shelters to buy food and take stock of the damage caused to 
their homes 
the communique said that aouns troops were not returning fire 
however sniper fire from positions in east beirut hit several 
streets in both moslem and christian sectors 
the shellings have triggered an exodus of residents from moslem 
west beirut and its southern shiite moslem slums long lines of 
cars packed with beds mattresses and suitcases continued to stream 
from the citys moslem sector heading south 
united nations sources said at least 35000 moslem families have 
sought refuge with relatives and friends in areas policed by un 
peacekeeping forces in south lebanon 
the confrontation was sparked when aoun clamped a blockade march 
6 on illegal ports operated by moslem militias along lebanons 
mediterranean coastline the ports were draining about 100 million 
a year from the five government harbors in lost tax revenues 
in retaliation jumblatt maj gen samit khatibs 22000strong 
moslem army and the syrians besieged the 310squaremile enclave 
where about 1 million christians live 
syria the main powerbroker in lebanon keeps about 40000 
troops in the country under a 1976 arab league mandate to end the 
civil war 
israel which maintains a selfdesignated security zone in south

voter rejection of a tax increase to pay for a 
vast expansion of the areas mass transit system will lead only to 
a worsening of the citys air pollution and traffic congestion 
disappointed supporters say 
id say get ready for los angeles said campaign coordinator 
bill meek 
voters in maricopa county on tuesday rejected a proposed 
halfcent sales tax increase by 224309 votes or 61 percent to 
143622 votes or 39 percent approval would have raised the sales 
tax in most of the county to 7 percent 
the 30year tax increase would have paid for an 84 billion 
system dubbed valtrans that had been hailed by some as the 
metropolitan areas salvation from traffic jams and smog and 
condemned by others as a waste of money 
the project called for a 103mile elevated railway 23 miles of 
rushhour train service freeway lanes for multiplepassenger 
vehicles and expansion of the bus system from 350 buses to 1500 
obviously this train is not leaving the station said mayor 
terry goddard 
the regional public transportation authority had projected a 
44peryear cost to the average household but a study by the 
arizona tax research associations put the cost at 82 to 107 
politicians leading the drive have lost credibility and touch 
with their constituents said tom smith a founder of voters 
against senseless transit 
valtrans was also pushed as a way to cut autoinsurance rates 
and allow families to get rid of second or third cars 
but opponents said that the phoenix area is too spread out for 
mass transit and that construction of freeways should have priority 
goddard called the defeat of the project a major setback but 
said voters turned down the specific proposal and not mass transit 
in general he said air pollution and traffic still have to be 
confronted 
were going to have a couple three more years where were 
falling behind in terms of dealing with these problems he said

nasa has agreed to back loans of up to 92 
million to build a factory to produce a critical rocket fuel 
ingredient that has been in short supply since an explosion leveled 
the manufacturers plant last may 
nasa and pacific engineering and production co said tuesday the 
agreement will pay for an ammonium perchlorate plant under 
construction near cedar city utah 
the agreement came a month after a shipment of the fuel oxidizer 
made by pepcon was seized aboard a ship bound for iran nasa 
however said the space agency had no information to suggest the 
company knew the shipment was headed to iran 
the loan actually is being provided by a bank but nasa and the 
department of defense are in essence guaranteeing it by agreeing 
to purchase at least 20 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a 
year for the next seven years 
the government stepped forward to help secure the loan because 
the 1988 blast at the companys plant in henderson nev left only 
one us supplier of the oxidizer used for the space shuttle and 
military rockets 
construction of the 73 million utah plant has continued under 
interim financing and the facility is expected to open in midmay 
said c keith rooker executive vice president of pepcons parent 
american pacific corp 
a 286000pound shipment of the oxidizer was seized feb 25 in 
rotterdam aboard a freighter bound for iran the 1144 30gallon 
drums were enough to fuel 300 military missiles and were valued at 
about 350000 officials said 
the shipment had been owned by a west german company da 
dampf which obtained it from a swiss company that had purchased it 
from girindus corp of tampa fla officials said girindus made 
the initial purchase from pepcon 
rooker said his company had investigated girindus before selling 
it the oxidizer and was satisified it was an honest and 
reputable buyer 
we never had any reason to know or suspect however remotely 
that any material we manufactured or sold was going to iran said 
rooker 
a federal judge in houston ruled tuesday that girindus must 
forfeit the shipment to the government he said customs agents had 
probable cause for the seizure

hour to hour

china today ruled out the possibility of an 
amnesty for political prisoners saying it did not think such a 
move was necessary 
wang hanbin vice chairman of the national peoples congress 
made the announcement shortly after seven human rights activists 
from hong kong presented chinas legislature with a letter calling 
for the release of political prisoners 
they specifically demanded the release of democracy advocate wei 
jingsheng who was arrested 10 years ago today and sentenced to 15 
years in prison for counterrevolutionary crimes 
on tuesday chinese customs officers held the hong kong human 
rights activists at the tanjin airport for three hours and seized a 
petition calling for an amnesty signed by 24000 people outside 
china 
the activists say they are concerned about future chinese 
treatment of hong kong which returns to chinese ownership in 1997 
since january intellectuals in china have written four open 
letters urging an amnesty and democratic change so far about 200 
people have signed the petitions which mark the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of communist china 
one of the leaders of the democracy wall movement of 1978 wei 
was jailed after he called for democratic change in china 
we demand to meet with wei jingsheng and other political 
prisoners in china anytime anywhere said emily lau a 
journalist and a member of the hong kong group 
in his statement to reporters vice chairman wang acknowledged 
china has in the past released prisoners such as war criminals and 
members of the old kuomintang army defeated by the communists in 
1949 
that was given to those who had turned over a new leaf in 
life and was in line with the countrys specific conditions 
then he said 
referring to the countrys 40th anniversary he said the 
congress is not considering giving nor does it think it necessary 
to offer special pardons to prisoners on the occasion the 
congress closes its annual session next week 
amnesty international a londonbased human rights group 
estimates thousands of chinese prisoners have been jailed for their 
beliefs 
china maintains it has no political prisoners 
chinese customs agents seized the hong kong petition on tuesday 
when the human rights activists arrived in tanjin a city near 
beijing 
the hong kong group which returned home today urged china to 
release its petition which was signed mostly by chinese from hong 
kong but people from 34 countries also signed the petition 
a chinese customs official said the seizure was made because the 
group was carrying an unreasonable amount of printed matter into 
china 
he said he didnt know when the petitions would be returned 
hong kong a british colony since the 19th century returns to 
china in 1997 china has guaranteed to keep its liberal economic 
and political system in place for 50 years but many hong kong 
intellectuals are skeptical 
the tianjin incident marks one of the first times the question 
of human rights in china has become intertwined with hong kongs 
future 
without democracy in china there cannot be possibilities for 
democracy in hong kong said lau tinchi a member of the hong 
kong group the 1997 question before us is tied with the question 
of whether democracy can be realized in china

no more sob stories a city board ruled a 
developer must lop the top 12 floors off a manhattan highrise 
the board of standards and appeals on tuesday unanimously denied 
a zoning variance to parkview associates which had offered to 
build about 40 lowincome senior citizen apartments if it could 
leave the building intact 
the builder has said it stands to lose 10 million by 
dismantling the foughtover floors 
but the board ruled there are no unique physical conditions 
peculiar to and inherent in the particular zoning lot which give 
rise to unnecessary hardship in complying with the provisions 
of the zoning resolution 
parkview which erected the 31story tower after city officials 
misread a zoning map that limited buildings to 19 floors had gone 
all the way to the us supreme court to avoid dismantling the 12 
stories that were topped off in 1986 
parkview attorney jay segal said he would meet with the 
developer in the next few days to decide whether to comply or 
appeal to state supreme court 
this is a very strong message zoning is not for sale no more 
indulging developers said genie rice president of a 
neighborhood group that led opposition to the building you cant 
decide to go ahead with a project and then buy your way out 
the fight began in 1986 when ms rice discovered the building 
violated zoning laws a state appeals court later ordered the upper 
floors removed saying that parkview must share the blame for not 
discovering the citys mistake 
the us supreme court left that ruling intact last year 
dismantling of the extra floors would be the same process used 
to tear down old buildings protective scaffolding is placed 
outside and workers pry off the brick facing break the concrete 
floor into chunks and cut through metalwork

police in alexandria va were tracking down 
suspected drug dealers and abusers who live in public housing after 
the federal government granted an unprecedented exemption making it 
easier to evict them 
the police are out on the street now arresting people and 
getting their addresses mayor james p moran said tuesday after 
being told that the department of housing and urban development had 
granted the district of columbia suburb an exemption from federal 
housing grievance regulations 
moran said the exemption requested after the killing of a 
police officer and a drugseeking gunman outside a housing project 
a week ago was needed to eliminate timeconsuming and costly 
regulations that discouraged local officials from pursuing 
evictions 
without the exemption hud regulations required local government 
officials to allow tenants threatened with evictions to appeal 
first to a federal administrative panel and then to the courts 
our review of the virginia statutes indicated a system of 
opportunities for two full trials a full range of due process 
guarantees hud general counseldesignate frank keating said in 
explaining the agencys decision 
although the exemption is directed at alexandria keating said 
the law is the same throughout the state of virginia and if 
other housing authorities had chronic drug activity they could 
expect to be exempted as well 
however keating said the exemption would be limited to evictions 
involving drug and drugrelated activity 
last month hud secretary jack kemp sent a memo to the directors 
of the nations 3300 public housing authorities asking them to 
report on steps they were taking to combat the drug trade on their 
properties 
kemp pledged to assist you and lawabiding residents in 
eliminating this plague from public housing 
were not going to take any chances on evicting anybody that 
might prove innocent said mayor moran explaining that the city 
would pursue evictions only in those cases where they have current 
evidence of criminal activity either committed by or condoned by 
the the public housing leaseholder 
were going to take advantage of it in both responsible and 
expeditious way to be a model for other housing authorities he 
said 
moran said police had a list of 45 people in the citys public 
housing units who were targeted 
the city sought the exemption at a meeting with hud officials on 
monday in the wake of a hostagetaking and fatal shootout at a 
public housing development in the old town section 
last week jamie martin wise 34 an escapee from a washington 
dc halfway house entered an apartment in the development 
demanded crack cocaine and held five people hostage 
wise later released four of the hostages but emerged from the 
building with the fifth hostage at gunpoint wise was shot by a 
police sharpshooter and fatally wounded police cpl charles w hill 
before succumbing to his own wounds another officer was wounded 
moran said the city was granted the exemption after 
demonstrating to hud officials that state law would insure tenants 
facing eviction would receive due process without the inclusion of 
some federal regulatory requirements 
he said tenants would retain their rights to appeal evictions in 
federal and district court with the options of a trial by jury or 
civil discovery 
theres a substantial protection already in the law moran 
said 
but a lawyer who won an injunction in federal court last january 
against new hud regulations that included granting exemptions to 
the grievance procedures disagreed 
i think hud doesnt have the right to grant the waiver said 
david bryson of the national law housing center in berkeley calif 
there is a serious question whether their granting the waiver 
would be in contempt of the injunction said bryson 
the injunction that the judge entered does not cover these 
specific issues it had to do with withholding the publication of 
the new grievance procedures until a number of features were 
incorporated with tenant input keating countered 
maria foscarinis an attorney for the national coalition for the 
homeless an homeless advocacy group said the concern with drug 
activity in public housing is understandable but the response seems 
a little out of proportion

he told reporters the americans declined accepting them and at 
that point the hijackers gave up desch said a military truck was 
driven onto the tarmac to prevent the jet from reaching the us 
base

an important radio telescope as wide as 
a football field collapsed because a 50inch steel plate had 
weakened said engineers investigating the loss of the nations 
most precise astronomical instrument 
the 25yearold telescope which resembled a 300footwide 
satellite dish collapsed nov 15 as the national radio astronomy 
observatory used it to map the universe 
until a replacement is built mapping work will shift to a 
140footwide telescope at the observatory in green bank said jim 
condon of the observatorys headquarters in charlottesville va 
its an annoyance but its not fatal he said officials 
hope to have the replacement built by 1993 
a panel of engineers hired by the national science foundation 
said tuesday the 600ton dish collapsed because of a ripped steel 
plate 
its kind of like this if you have a pyramid on three pillars 
and you crack one of the pillars its going to come at you said 
ludwig oster national science foundation astronomy director 
scientists who inspected the structure annually failed to detect 
stress on the plate because the lattice support structure under the 
dish obscured the trouble spot according to an engineers report 
the document did not blame anyone for failing to discover the 
problem 
the foundation said it will cost 70 million to replace the 
telescope but that the new one will be larger sturdier and more 
flexible the original telescope which could be adjusted only on a 
northsouth axis cost 850000

a black detainee escaped today 
and took refuge in the us consulate officials said six other 
former detainees sought refuge in the british embassy and demanded 
an end to restrictions on their activities 
police said simon ntombela a teacher and antiapartheid 
organizer who has been on a hunger strike eluded six guards and 
escaped at daybreak from shifa hospital in the port city of durban 
gene friedman a us embassy spokesman said late this 
afternoon that ntombela had reached johannesburg 360 miles away 
and was at the us consulate 
we have been in touch with the south african government with a 
view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible 
said friedman he did not say how ntombela reached the consulate 
ntombela 27 was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital 
since september he fled as the government announced new steps to 
prevent such breakouts 
seven other detainees who escaped from hospitals since september 
quickly sought safety in foreign diplomatic missions the 
government allowed all seven to remain free 
shortly before midday today six black activists entered the 
british embassy in pretoria and said they would stay until the 
government lifted restrictions imposed on them following their 
release 
the embassy issued a statement saying the six cannot stay 
indefinitely on british government premises and should leave 
we are nevertheless prepared to draw to the attention of the 
south african government once again to the issue of restrictions 
but we do not believe that the visitors case is being furthered by 
their continued stay in the embassy the statement said 
one of the six was donsie khumalo a regional official of the 
congress of south african trade unions the main black labor 
federation he was released last week after staging a hunger strike 
to protest being held without charge 
like many other freed activists khumalo 39 is barred from 
various political activities required to report to a police 
station twice daily and confined to his house at night 
the other activists who entered the embassy compound were 
involved with antiapartheid organizations in the pretoria area 
colleagues of the six said their intention was to encourage 
britain to pressure south african authorities to lift restrictions 
on all former detainees 
their move coincided with a visit by british prime minister 
margaret thatcher to neighboring zimbabwe she was expected to 
discuss the south african political situation with officials from 
zimbabwe and mozambique 
brig leon mellet a spokesman for law and order minister 
adriaan vlok said ntombelas escape proved that stricter control 
will have to be placed on persons hospitalized and who are in 
custody a central facility for this purpose will have to be made 
available 
mellet said detainees who go on hunger strikes in the future 
will be placed in grootvlei prison in bloemfontein and if they 
require hospital treatment will be sent to pelomini provincial 
hospital outside the city 
bloemfontein is a relatively remote provincial capital in 
central south africa where detainees would have more difficulty 
escaping and where publicity about the hunger strike campaign might 
be reduced 
an estimated 600 detainees have gone on hunger strikes since 
january to protest being held without charge the government says 
most detainees have been freed since the fasts began but human 
rights activists say several hundred remain in detention 
the detainees are held under a state of emergency declared 
almost three years ago to quell antiapartheid unrest in black 
townships 
south africas system of apartheid establishes a racially 
segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs while the 5 million whites control the economy 
schools and health services 
ntombelas lawyer dahya pillay said ntombela was detained in 
johannesburg sept 2 and was admitted to hospital in early march 
for treatment of depression ms pillay said he began a hunger 
strike march 13

a federal court improperly barred oklahoma 
officials from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales at a motel 
run by the chickasaw indian tribe outside its reservation the 
supreme court ruled today 
in an unsigned opinion the court sent the case back to state 
courts in oklahoma to decide the dispute 
the fact that the tribe may have grounds under federal law to 
claim immunity from the taxes does not give the federal courts 
initial authority to rule in the dispute the high court said 
the justices overturned a ruling by the 10th us circuit court 
of appeals that barred oklahoma from imposing the taxes but 
todays ruling does not decide whether in fact oklahoma may 
impose the taxes 
the motel run by the chickasaws is located within the city 
limits of sulphur okla and was purchased by the tribe from the 
federal small business administration in 1972 
the federal government retains title to the land on which the 
motel sits holding it in trust for the tribe 
oklahoma officials said an indian tribe should not have complete 
immunity from state laws in areas off the reservation 
the 10th circuit court ruled against the state in june 1987 
saying tribal sovereign immunity bars such suits against indian 
tribes unless congress specifically authorizes them 
the supreme court in december 1987 temporarily set aside the 
ruling and ordered further study by the appeals court in light of 
the justices 1987 ruling in a california case that restricted the 
transfer of state court suits to federal courts 
the justices in the california case barred a federal court from 
presiding over a suit by workers who said they were fired illegally 
the 10th circuit court after restudying the chickasaw case 
again ruled in favor of the tribe last year 
in todays ruling the supreme court said the 10th circuit court 
ruling is plainly inconsistent with the justices decision in 
the california case 
there were no recorded dissents 
the case is oklahoma tax commission vs graham 88266

after years of controversy and public debate a 
renovated and sparkling louvre museum opened today crowned by a 
tall glass pyramid at its new entrance 
after president francois mitterrand cut the ribbon at the 
inauguration ceremony and toured the collection hundreds of people 
crowded in for a look 
its light its beautiful its superb said martine 
bieriduminy who lives nearby and watched the pyramid designed by 
american architect im pei being built 
in the beginning people in the neighborhood were against it 
they thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture she said 
the dark dingy louvre most tourists remember is now a thing of 
the past in its place is what is called the grand louvre a 
splendid ultramodern and hightech facility 
the sixyear 850 million overhaul is the first part of a vast 
project to turn the louvre once a medieval fortress and then a 
royal palace into the worlds largest museum a distinction now 
held by the american museum of natural history in new york 
the louvre project will be completed when the museums northern 
wings occupied by the finance ministry for the past 100 years 
open to the public in 1993 
the grand louvre is a unique blend of grandeur history and 
convenience 
visitors who once wandered looking for the museums entrance 
cant miss the new one a 70foot transparent pyramid soaring out 
between the louvres main wings and flanked by three small pyramids 
and fountains 
at the groundlevel entrance are escalators and a graceful 
spiral staircase leading down to a vast lightdrenched lobby 
featuring ticket windows the museum bookstore boutiques 
restaurants and a 400seat auditorium 
the lobby itself can handle 6000 people time without crowding 
escalators leading to other parts of the museum branch out from the 
lobby like spokes in a wheel and shorten the routes to works like 
the mona lisa and winged victory 
the baroque architecture of the louvre built under napoleon iii 
looms large against the everchanging paris skyscape 
i used to pray for sun pei said in an interview 
afterward i realized that the pyramid is even more transparent 
on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the paris sky 
a visit to the louvre is a trip back in time visitors now have 
direct access to the vestiges of the medieval castle built by king 
louis philippe in 1200 to protect paris from invaders from england 
also on show is a history of the louvre documented by thousands 
of artifacts dug up in the napoleon courtyard they bring to life 
the daily routines of parisians from the 15th to the 19th centuries 
with about 650000 square feet of additional floor space 
hundreds of paintings will have been dusted off and displayed for 
the first time 
on view for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by 
charles le brun 16191690 titled lhistoire dalexandre 
when the grand louvre is completed in 1993 it will house about 
4000 items nearly double what it displays today 
peis pyramid in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass 
was the most controversial aspect of the renovation 
five years ago i had my doubts pei said not many people 
would have bet on this project 
backed strongly by mitterrand who initiated the project pei 
perservered the public was won over when a fullsize model was 
erected on the spot 
all through the centuries the louvre has undergone violent 
changes pei said the time had to be right i was confident 
because this is the right time

the supreme court today barred states from 
denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their 
sabbath even if the refusal is not based on a religious sects 
doctrine 
the justices in a unanimous 90 decision said illinois 
officials violated a peoria mans religious freedom by denying him 
unemployment benefits 
the high court previously had barred states from denying 
unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain work because of 
religious scruples but in all previous cases the workers refusal 
was based on the teachings of an established religious group such 
as the seventhday adventists or the jehovahs witnesses 
justice byron r white wrote for the court never did we 
suggest that unless a claimant belongs to a sect that forbids what 
his job requires his belief however sincere must be deemed a 
purely personal preference rather than a religious belief 
the ruling means for example that a methodist or roman 
catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing 
to work on sunday even though neither church bars sunday work as 
part of its official doctrine 
in another ruling the court overturned a federal appeals court 
ruling barring oklahoma from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales 
at a motel run by the chickasaw indian tribe outside its 
reservation the justices unsigned opinion sent the case back to 
oklahomas state courts for a decision 
in the case dealing with work on the sabbath william frazee of 
peoria was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits after 
turning down in 1984 a temporary job assignment that would have 
required him to work on sunday 
frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of 
christianity is that nonemergency work on sundays is forbidden 
the illinois department of employment security ruled that 
frazees rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving 
unemployment benefits 
state officials while not questioning frazees sincerity said 
a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based on some 
tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church sect or 
denomination and not based merely on personal religious 
convictions 
frazee sued and illinois courts ruled against him but the 
supreme court today said the state courts were wrong 
white rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for 
frazee would lead to americans seeking sundays off because they 
want to shop play sports or even watch football on television 
we are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away 
from sunday employ if william frazee succeeds in his claim white 
said 
there may exist state interests sufficiently compelling to 
override a legitimate claim to the free exercise of religion he 
added no such interest has been presented here 
the case dealing with sabbath work is frazee vs employment 
security department 871945 the chickasaw case is oklahoma tax 
commission vs graham 88266

a man accused of killing a detective during a drug 
raid cannot be tried because police lied to obtain the search 
warrant a judge ruled today 
superior court judge charles m grabau dismissed the murder 
charge against albert lewin ending a case that has raised question 
about whether police routinely lie in obtaining warrants 
a fair trial is not possible the judge told a jammed 
courtroom the conduct was egregious and the evidence is 
tainted 
lewin 33 was charged in the slaying of detective sherman 
griffiths during a raid feb 17 1988 griffiths 36 was trying to 
break into an apartment when he was hit by a bullet fired through 
the door 
police later admitted that they had obtained the search warrant 
on the word of an informant who didnt exist lewin did not match 
the warrants description of the cocaine dealer police said 
occupied the apartment 
detectives carlos a luna 32 hugo amate 31 and paul 
schroeder 33 have been suspended while under investigation for 
possible perjury 
the court had no choice but to dismiss the case said max stern 
lewins attorney it was not a lie it was hundreds of lies he 
said and in an effort to reinstate the case it was just more 
lies 
but prosecutors had argued that because there was strong 
evidence against lewin and because police had admitted their 
misconduct the case should be tried 
grabau ordered lewin held for 24 hours while prosecutors decide 
whether to appeal his decision

statesmanjournal salem ore on planting trees 
planting a tree seems like such a little thing how could it 
become one way that the average person can save earth from 
overheating 
los angeles has launched a campaign to encourage the city and 
its citizens to plant from two million to five million trees in the 
next five years 
the trees would cool sidewalks and buildings provide attractive 
screening of freeways and concrete buildings and most of all 
absorb carbon dioxide that is believed to be the major cause of an 
impending worldwide warming trend 
since los angeles turns out more carbon dioxide as well as many 
other harmful chemicals than just about any other city in the 
world it is a good place to start a campaign to plant trees 
trees like other vegetation consume carbon dioxide as fuel and 
give off oxygen as a byproduct 
last week the environmental protection agency threw its weight 
behind treeplanting 
the agency recommended stopping the net global deforestation by 
planting at least as many trees as are felled

the journal new ulm minn on the minimum wage proposals 
the house of representatives is on a collision course with 
george bush over the issue of minimum wage 
the house passed a bill that sets the minimum wage at 455 
per hour 30 cents higher than bushs proposal the bill does 
include a subminimum wage provision for firsttime workers a 
provision that bush also supports 
bush has vowed to veto the bill and it appears the house does 
not now have the votes to override his veto 
the senate version of the bill calls for raising the minimum 
wage to 465 per hour and doesnt include a subminimum wage 
though that could be included as a compromise 
congress should take care in adjusting the minimum wage there 
is a danger economists agree that hiking the wage will result in 
fewer jobs especially for people just starting out in the job 
market

democrat and chronicle and timesunion rochester ny on the 
alaska oil spill 
the largest oil spill in us history is more than a tragedy 
its an outrage 
the 11milliongallon spill last friday from the tanker exxon 
valdez was not only predictable but predicted and with routine 
care it could have been prevented 
the tanker collided at least twice with rocks in the 
hardtonavigate waters of prince william sound 25 miles south of 
valdez the southern terminus of the trans alaska pipeline 
the corporate attitude has always been get off our backs we 
know what were doing 
clearly the companies have lost the argument but 
environmentally conscious citizens cant take much comfort in 
itoldyousos not when the price is 11 million gallons of 
spilled oil that could damage coastal waters for years to come

the houston post on newt gingrich as house republican whip 
republicans in the us house of representatives have sent out a 
message no more mister nice guy 
by choosing georgia bulldog newt gingrich as minority whip the 
vastly outnumbered republican members turned away from traditional 
moderate leadership and toward confrontational politics 
gingrich replacing dick cheney of wyoming who left congress 
to become secretary of defense has a welldeserved reputation as 
a partisan fighter 
in addition there is no love lost between gingrich and house 
speaker jim wright 
but there is too much work ahead for all the members to allow 
rancor and backbiting to dominate this session gingrich will best 
serve his party his colleagues and his country by keeping this in 
mind

the journalbulletin providence ri on drug testing 
in a time when substance abuse has become such a problem that 
the federal authorities have seen fit to appoint an antidrug czar 
it was inevitable that testing employees for illicit drugs would be 
included in the governments arsenal of weapons 
and in a system where every policy is measured against 
constitutional standards it was equally certain that the supreme 
court would someday have to rule on the legitimacy of such testing 
programs 
that process has now produced its first major pronouncements 
in our view these decisions are reasonable attempts to 
determine the circumstances under which federal employees rights 
of privacy must give way to their employees duty to protect the 
public

the hemet calif news on drug testing 
in its first ruling on mandatory drug tests the us supreme 
court appropriately put public safety ahead of privacy rights 
it upheld federal regulations requiring testing of railroad 
crews after train accidents the rules were put in place to deter 
employees from using drugs and alcohol 
in a separate case the court also upheld a customs service 
policy of testing employees or applicants seeking jobs involving 
seizing drugs or carrying firearms 
some 40 cases remain in the pipeline several of which probably 
will reach the high court one involves the testing of air traffic 
controllers who surely ought to fit the courts definition of 
workers who may be tested for public safety reasons

the bellingham wash herald on soviet reforms 
the longer perestroika economic reform and glasnost 
greater openess are allowed in the soviet union the more a 
revolutionary political notion is reaffirmed 
give people the opportunity and inevitably they yearn to be 
free to control their own lives instead of having them controlled 
by government 
many western observers doubt that the new soviet revolution can 
succeed they may be right some communist party officials are 
abrogating power and privileges grudgingly some soviet citizens 
fear change 
if soviet authorities continue to give the people a legitimate 
voice in choosing what that change will be count on them to do 
what people almost always do opt for more freedom 
when people are allowed to flourish they have more to give back 
if they arent theyll rebel when given a chance

the albuquerque nm tribune on the soviet elections 
for the first time since 1917 the soviet union held a contested 
election sunday and its architect mikhail gorbachev professed 
satisfaction instead he has reason for concern 
evidence from the quasidemocratic balloting for a new 
parliament suggests the party apparatus after seven decades of 
autocratic rule and a virtual monopoly on propaganda enjoys shaky 
loyalty from the ordinary worker 
only 1500 of the 2250 seats in the congress of peoples 
deputies were up for grabs of which 384 were onecandidate 
races no fewer than 750 deputies including gorbachev were 
appointed to the congress by the party leadership and official 
organizations it controls 
nevertheless the results of many real contests must alarm the 
kremlin in the baltic states nationalists who demand autonomy or 
independence from moscow did well in moscow and other cities a 
handful of radicals who favor a multiparty system anathema to 
gorbachev were elected 
if as much of the world believes a regimes legitimacy derives 
from the peoples consent grobachev has a lot of fast talking to

the miami herald tuesday on following the soviets election 
lead 
it wasnt the noholdsbarred yallcome kind of election that 
americans take for granted but the soviet vote on sunday was 
historic nonetheless 
observers barely recognized the nation that for 70 years has 
accepted lenins view that elections are too cumbersome a mechanism 
for a revolutionary government 
could such a thing happen in havana of course if fidel 
castros boot were lifted from the peoples necks 
and why not if the states economic policies can be the subject 
of an electoral debate in moscow and if two opponents who are 
military officers can contend for and against the soviet draft why 
not in cuba 
and if bold reporters can ask candidates about such stateset 
perquisites as the size of their apartments in moscow why not in 
nicaragua angola 
those reasons are no longer good enough in marxisms 
unchallenged capital moscow they cannot for much longer hold sway

the arizona daily star tucson ariz on salvadoran elections 
el salvadors newly elected president understands the importance 
of winning favor with a generous us congress so be skeptical 
congress 
alfredo cristianis talk about wanting to run a government at 
the peoples service could reflect a sincere desire to bring 
peace to his embattled country 
or it could be a cynical attempt to keep the bucks flowing from 
the north this country has sent 35 billion in mostly military 
aid to el salvador in this decade us aid exceeds el salvadors 
national budget 
that money bought a lot of sorrow the eightyear civil war cost 
about 70000 lives 
president jose napoleon duarte will be turning the government of 
el salvador over to an elected successor that could be seen as a 
component of establishing a democratic tradition in central america 
but all those american dollars have neither ended the civil war 
nor improved the living conditions for the 13 million el 
salvadorans 
nor has the money bought much political change 
so be careful congress make sure american dollars arent used 
to buy more misery in central america

the joy at the white house with first dog millie and her six new 
puppies is understandable 
the bush family loves dogs apparently and that is a good 
example for americans who think the family pet is something to be 
tied in the backyard for endless hours or left to run through the 
neighbors petunias 
but what kind of other example is the first family making with 
this miracle of birth 
naturally the puppies all are spoken for with new homes 
awaiting them but that isnt the case for so many other puppies 
not born in the white house 
people should neuter their pets to avoid bringing more unwanted 
animals into the world if they want to adopt a new one there are 
plenty awaiting homes at all the animal shelters and humane

democrat jill long the upset winner in 
a special election for the house seat once held by dan quayle 
received a congratulatory call today from the vice president 
he wished me well and congratulated me and offered to assist 
in any way because hes committed to the fourth district said 
long whose victory after two previous failed campaigns ended a 
13year republican hold on the district 
long 36 a business professor received 65160 votes or 51 
percent to 63388 votes or 49 percent for republican dan heath 
republican party chairman lee atwater said in washington he was 
ashamed the gop had lost i have no excuses we should have 
won that race i am very surprised we lost it he said 
atwater paid the winner a backhanded compliment when he said she 
ran a campaign i would have been proud of that included plenty 
of attacks against heath 
the victory was the democrats first in the northeast indiana 
district since 1974 and ended a string of seven gop victories some 
marked by 21 margins that quayle began in 1976 
long told quayle she had learned valuable lessons in her senate 
campaign against him in 1986 
at her first news conference as representativeelect today long 
said she didnt regard the election as a test of strength between 
national republicans and democrats despite the help from 
washington for both campaigns 
this was just a race between two individuals in northeast 
indiana she said 
its a hard pill to swallow but i am a man and a good man 
and i did my best said heath who claimed long had distorted his 
record with negative advertising painting him as a privileged 
lawyer and a bureaucrat 
the democrats seized an unexpected opportunity presented when 
incumbent dan coats resigned in january to take the senate seat 
vacated when quayle became vice president 
running a familiar candidate against a relative unknown 
democrats poured at least 250000 into the campaign in less than 
two months and former democratic presidential hopeful sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee stumped for long 
heath 36 received as much support from republicans but was 
tied to the unpopular administration of mayor paul helmke whom he 
served as safety director 
heath lost despite campaign visits by quayle barbara bush and 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
long lost the november general election by nearly 50000 votes 
to coats a former house aide to quayle who took over the seat when 
quayle mounted his first successful senate race in 1980 
two years earlier quayle drubbed long to win his second senate 
term 
long ran those races with minimal funding and was criticized by 
some party regulars for not campaigning aggressively but she said 
the experience paved the way for tuesdays victory 
i think i had generated or built a lot of support in 1986 and 
again last year in two very tough races she said i think by 
holding news conferences and traveling throughout the district i 
was able to get my message out 
and that is that i will be an independent voice for northeast 
indiana and my country 
long said she expected to be sworn in monday giving indiana 
democrats a 73 advantage in the states delegation in congress 
campaign officials in both parties had predicted a light voter 
turnout with estimates ranging as low as 25 to 30 percent but 
nearly half the districts 267000 registered voters cast ballots

authorities cut off 
food water and power at a prison farm today where armed inmates 
were holed up for a fourth day with hundreds of people who were 
visiting when the prisoners revolted 
its the only way we can pressure them carlos ramos 
moncada inspector general of prisons said of the mutinous 
inmates if we dont they could stay inside for days or weeks 
he told reporters as he entered the prison 
he said supplies and power was cut off before dawn to the area 
of the prison controlled by scores of rebellious inmates 
witnesses said tuesday that as many as 100 inmates and about 600 
visitors had depleted food stocked in the area under their control 
authorities are unsure whether visitors still inside are 
hostages or are there to support and protect the rebels 
negotiations with the prisoners who took over the pavon prison 
farm on easter sunday came to a standstill tuesday the inmates 
were told to lay down their arms and let the civilians leave or 
face the cutoff of food water and power 
were at an impasse the rev antonio lopez martin chaplain 
of guatemalan prisons said late tuesday lopez is part of the 
delegation negotiating with the inmates at the facility outside 
guatemala city 
the bodies of four guards and three inmates who were killed in 
sundays takeover have been recovered authorities said five 
others are believed dead said prison spokesman conrado monroy but 
their bodies have not been found on the grounds of the 
2squaremile prison guatemalas largest 
about 20 inmates not among the rebels were transported to 
another prison on tuesday they were seen leaving the prison 
handcuffed by twos another half dozen visitors who had been inside 
since sunday also made their way out 
most of the prisons 1350 inmates were not involved in the 
rebellion officials said the facility is designed to house 800 
people 
the prison seizure resulted from a frustrated escape attempt 
authorities said when inmates commandeered about 75 m1 rifles and 
ammunition from the prison arsenal 
about 1000 army and police troopers were stationed around the 
facility but president vinicio cerezo has said force will not be 
used unless the inmates try to shoot their way out 
the rebels have demanded amnesty for crimes committed since 
sunday reduced sentences better food and treatment and removal of 
the facilitys current authorities 
the main sticking point in negotiations appears to be the 
governments inability or unwillingness to guarantee amnesty for 
crimes committed during the rebellion 
the government has offered not to harm inmates involved in the 
uprising and says it will intercede on their behalf before the 
supreme court the only authority constitutionally empowered to 
award pardons 
most of the rebels were serving terms of up to 30 years for 
murder kidnapping and other felonies

a man with a large knife today 
slashed 10 17th century dutch paintings including several by 
pupils of rembrandt a museum official said 
it is an enormous disaster spokesman willem de paus said of 
the incident at the dordrechts museum in this western city 
the attacker a 61yearold unemployed man who was not 
identified in line with dutch judicial practice was being held by 
police in nearby papendrecht works by albert cuyp nicolaas maes 
ferdinand bol jacobus levecc and jan victors were damaged in the 
attack 
he was apparently very frustrated that he was out of work and 
he wanted to vent his anger de paus told the associated press in 
a telephone interview 
among the damaged paintings are a 1656 family group by bol a 
selfportrait from 1685 by maes and a conversion of saulus done by 
cuyp in 1650 according to de paus 
the man entered the museum at about 145 pm said de paus he 
inflicted very bad damage to 10 paintings on display in three 
rooms before being spotted by a guard via a closed television 
circuit the spokesman said 
two guards tried to overpower the man but he escaped by 
threatening them with the knife according to de paus he 
surrendered later 
theyre really very heavily damaged from some of them he cut 
whole chunks and others have large diagonal slashes de paus 
said adding that it was too early to establish whether the 
paintings were beyond repair 
he estimated the value of the paintings at many millions of 
guilders dollars 
in december three paintings by vincent van gogh were stolen 
from the kroellermueller museum in the eastern netherlands the 
works were not recovered 
in may three paintings among them a van gogh and a work by 
french impressionist paul cezanne were taken from amsterdams 
municipal museum they were found 11 days later 
the incidents have raised grave doubts about security in dutch 
museums where a government austerity drive has resulted in a 
decrease in museum staffing

the nations first 
licensed private spaceship blasted off into the morning sky today 
on a suborbital flight lasting 15 minutes 
the consort 1 payload of scientific experiments went through 
more than seven minutes of near weightlessness after the 842 am 
launch the craft climbed 198 miles above earth and landed about 50 
miles north of the launch pad 
weve been working a long time to put up a successful 
launch said a jubilant bill vance vice president of finance and 
administration for space service inc which launched the 
commercial rocket its the first of many and we think its a 
real breakthrough 
spectators cheered as the slender white rocket shot into the 
cloudless sky leaving a white vapor trail 
the 100 people who gathered 1 miles from the launch pad didnt 
hear the rockets whoosh until it dropped its first stage six 
seconds and more than a mile into the flight the rocket 
disappeared from view in 25 seconds 
the voyage was a small step by the standards of previous space 
travel but a giant leap for the fledgling private spacecraft 
industry observers inside and outside the government believe 
in the 1990s private companies are expected to begin putting 
satellites into orbit as the federal government gets out of the 
business 
the federal government began to realize the potential of the 
private space industry after the successful september 1982 launch 
of the conestoga 1 rocket with a dummy payload from matagorda 
island texas officials said 
but space services inc the houstonbased company responsible 
for both the conestoga and consort rockets had to deal with 18 
federal agencies in its quest to fire conestoga 1 because there was 
no precedent for the flight 
that prompted the federal government to assign the department of 
transportation the task of licensing private launches and helping 
cut red tape the consort 1 is the first commercial ship licensed 
by the department 
the government felt more pressure to foster private launches 
after the disaster of the space shuttle challenger in january 1986 
said ray whitten of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations office for commercial programs 
the transportation department expects to process 10 launch 
licenses this year said carol lane director of the agencys 
commercial space transportation department 
five companies are offering launch services and florida hawaii 
and virginia are considering offering private spaceports she said 
space services sees suborbital flights like the consort 1 as 
only a beginning and plans orbital flights in the future spokesman 
mark daniels said 
the orbital business is where well make the big bucks he 
said 
consort 1 is estimated to cost 1 million to 2 million daniels 
said he expects to see space services generate annual revenues of 
100 million to 500 million once it starts sending satellites into 
orbit in the next decade 
the consort 1s 650pound payload was assembled by the 
university of alabamahuntsvilles consortium for materials 
development in space one of 16 commercial development consortiums 
sponsored by nasa 
it includes experiments designed to measure how liquids mix in 
weightlessness how plastic foam forms and cures how liquids coat 
glass surfaces how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and how finely 
powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce alloys 
the experiments have applications in medicine the manufacture 
of metal alloys and in construction of space stations 
consort 1 was boosted into space by a modified terrier navy 
rocket the second stage is a black brant rocket the entire 
vehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6000 pounds at liftoff

former attorney general edwin meese iii 
acknowledged today that after twice urging oliver north to tell the 
truth north withheld critical details about the diversion of iran 
arms sale money to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
testifying at norths trial on 12 felony charges meese was 
asked by prosecutor john keker whether the white house national 
security aide had mentioned the involvement of arms dealers richard 
secord or albert hakim in the diversion 
no sir meese replied when asked about secord then hakim 
meese also acknowledged that north hadnt mentioned the role of 
swissbased attorney willard zucker who worked for hakim and 
secord 
the exattorney general also said north hadnt mentioned how the 
price of the arms sold to iran had been marked up by 270 percent 
with some of the excess going to the contras 
meese said he told north he shouldnt conceal anything both at 
the beginning of the interview and just before disclosing that he 
knew of the diversion plan from a memo north prepared 
kekers questioning followed testimony tuesday in which meese 
agreed with defense attorney brendan sullivan that the nov 23 
1986 interview was more like a chat between coworkers 
today sullivan in his closing question to the former attorney 
general made the point that north had told the truth on the central 
point of the interview by telling meese that the diversion had 
occurred 
north is charged with falsely telling meese that the national 
security council had no involvement with the diversion and that 
israel determined the amount of money funneled to the contras in 
fact north and other us officials were directing the secret 
operation 
meese testified tuesday that his interview with north was part 
of an administrative inquiry not a criminal investigation 
under questioning by us district judge gerhard a gesell 
meese said norths obligation to answer questions was as a loyal 
member of the administration and that he was under no legal 
compulsion to do so 
meese agreed with sullivan that the reagan administration was 
worried that the political fallout from the diversion could cause 
the toppling of the president himself 
meeses discovery of the diversion came during a weekend inquiry 
he conducted for reagan earlier disclosure of the administrations 
secret weapons sales to iran had already produced an uproar 
meese who informed president reagan of the diversion on nov 
24 1986 said he didnt know if the word impeachment itself 
was used in discussions but that there was anxiety over the 
tremendous consequences 
meese said he was concerned that administration opponents might 
get hold of the information and make it public so he urged quick 
action to limit the political damage he held a news conference the 
next day to announce the news 
i felt it vital that there not be any appearance of a 
coverup said the former attorney general 
north was fired and his boss national security adviser john 
poindexter resigned also the tower commission was created and 
independent counsel lawrence walsh was appointed in december 1986 
they were the actions taken because they were the appropriate 
actions to take in any event said meese but one of the 
concerns was from preventing this from being used by political 
opponents of the president 
meese described interviewing north on nov 23 1986 a sunday 
seeking confirmation of a memo found the previous day at norths 
national security council office the memo by north outlined a plan 
for the diversion 
the nsc aide told meese the diversion had already occurred from 
an earlier arms shipment to iran 
your worst nightmare had come true north lawyer brendan 
sullivan asked meese 
yes meese replied 
you knew that spelled trouble asked sullivan 
yes i did responded meese

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan has reversed course and will take 215000 in severance 
pay from his previous job as a medical school president 
sullivan said in a statement released tuesday evening by his 
office that the severance which was part of his contract as 
president of the morehouse school of medicine has been approved by 
the office of government ethics 
i have made this agreement in the full faith that it in no way 
presents ethical difficulty or appearance of difficulty with 
regard to my services as hhs secretary he said 
sullivan had previously decided to forgo the money because he 
said he wanted to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts 
of interest with his connection to the medical school which 
receives federal grants he said such questions could hamper his 
effectiveness and damage morehouses image 
even though the office of government ethics had informally 
approved the severance pay as money earned before he came to the 
federal government sullivan said he was concerned by news reports 
at the time that raised conflict questions about his connection to 
morehouse 
but his sacrifice raised concerns on capitol hill members of 
congress said that while his decision was admirable they were 
concerned it could set a precedent and discourage others from 
taking government jobs 
indeed sullivans announcement came one day after a new york 
times editorial also bade him to reconsider and take the money 
saying unjust sacrifice can weaken standards as much as lax 
enforcement 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today 
that president bush was pleased by the decision fitzwater said a 
senate committee which reviewed sullivans nomination felt he was 
entitled to some money so there was no question in terms of an 
ethical problem 
when sullivan decided to forfeit the money bush was on the 
defensive about ethics issues with questions being raised about 
then defense secretarydesignate john towers relationships with 
defense contractors white house ethics chief c boyden grays 
links to a communications corporation housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemps acceptance of speaking fees 
exceeding house limits and agriculture secretary clayton yeutters 
acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco company 
the secretary the highestranking black in the bush 
administration said in an interview earlier this month that he 
would readily reverse his decision because im not a wealthy 
man sullivan saw his annual pay drop from 172000 last year to 
89500 in his new job 
he had said however that he would wait until the senate 
finance committee completed its review of the matter 
though the committee has not formally acted the panels staff 
drafted a letter encouraging bush to see to it that dr sullivan 
reconsiders his decision because we think others will be 
influenced by what he has done said a committee source who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
with sullivans reversal the wording of the letter to be 
signed by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas committee chairman and sen 
bob packwood rore ranking member would probably be changed to 
support the secretarys change of heart the source said 
sullivan earlier had said the severance clause in his contract 
entitled him to 297000 hhs spokesman campbell gardett said the 
215000 agreed to by sullivan and the medical school was an 
amount he felt was fair for him and morehouse 
sullivan is taking an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of 
medicine at the medical school which he founded 
earlier he had asked the white house for permission to take a 
paid sabbatical from the school but the request was denied because 
morehouses sabbatical policy did not meet the federal governments 
standards 
the white house was concerned the school did not apply its 
sabbatical policy uniformly which could make it appear that the 
school while receiving federal money was illegally subsidizing 
the pay of a federal official

companies tired of using blimps and 
billboards for their advertising might want to hitch their products 
to a star a red star 
the swiss advertising agency punto sa has signed a deal with 
the soviets to find western firms who want to plug their products 
via the sovet space program 
andrea capra said tuesday he signed a contract with soviet 
authorities in october to sell advertising space on their 
spaceships launch pads and cosmonaut uniforms 
an official at the soviet trade mission in bern confirmed that 
the soviets were working with the biennebased firm there were 
negotiations last year which ended in success said the soviet 
official who asked not to be identified 
the main exposure would be on the ground at space launches 
which the soviets have indicated they want to open increasingly to 
western tv crews capra said the footage could be shown on tv as 
part of international news coverage or used later for publicity 
purposes he added 
advertising would likely be painted on rocket sections which 
fall into the sea after launching he said but under the accord 
cosmonauts also could wear publicity stickers on their inflight 
suits like formula one racers 
a prime billboard would be the mir manned space station 
which has space for two company or product logos capra said 
were in concrete negotiations with three multinationals 
capra said he declined to identify the companies 
the first soviet space shot with advertising could take place as 
early as this fall he said he said he launched the idea because 
it simply seemed more original than advertising on american space 
shuttles

the wife of one of chinas most famous jailed 
dissidents has not been allowed to see him for more than three 
years and says he has been forced to sleep on bricks in a 
mosquitoinfested cell 
kang tong said the last time she visited xu wenli his teeth 
were falling out his hair had turned white and the skin hung loose 
on his face xu is 46 
she keeps a crumpled piece of paper in her coat pocket with the 
date she last saw her husband oct 10 1985 
her daughter xu jin a 16yearold with a pony tail and pink 
cheeks doesnt need the reminder she knows the date by heart 
despite regulations guaranteeing inmates one visit a month no 
relatives have seen xu since 1985 still from the six or seven 
letters that are allowed to be sent every year they know hes 
alive 
we both just want him home kang said in an interview this 
week our family needs a husbands help and a fathers love 
an electrician by profession xu was jailed in 1981 and 
sentenced to 15 years for counterrevolutionary activities his 
crimes included taking part in the democracy wall movement of 1978 
during which he published an unsanctioned periodical calling for 
political change 
in his mimeographed journal april 5th forum xu argued a 
multiparty system was not antimarxist and would help the socialist 
cause 
the movement was tolerated by chinas new leader deng xiaoping 
until he consolidated his power then came the crackdown 
since january more and more chinese intellectuals have begun 
calling for the release of political prisoners such as xu and wei 
jingsheng who was arrested 10 years ago wednesday for helping lead 
the democracy movement the government says no release is planned 
and denies it holds political prisoners 
kang remembers well her october 1985 visit to the beijing no 1 
prison 
xu came to the window wearing his black prison overalls no 001 
stitched to his shirt pocket 
his hair was almost all white and his skin was loose on his 
face his teeth were all rotting it was pitiful to know that this 
man was once a free man she said 
soon thereafter an essay by xu was smuggled out of prison 
titled my selfdefense xu gave details of his arrest and 
prosecution 
without explanation kang was not allowed any more visits 
i wrote to the jail i went to the jail to plead to see my 
husband but they wouldnt let me she said they told me that i 
knew the reason 
in may 1986 kang needed to consult with her husband about an 
experimental operation planned for their daughters left leg but 
the prison refused 
miss xu went herself to plead with the warden but he turned her 
down 
he said go ask your mother the reason why said the girl 
who has since undergone two operations and hopes to have her cast 
removed in may 
after the essay was smuggled out life became increasingly 
difficult for xu his wife said citing his letters and reports 
from sympathetic friends with sources in the jail 
prison authorities moved him from an 86squarefoot room to a 
43squarefoot cell guards took away his bed and forced him to 
sleep on bricks lights were kept on constantly in the winter he 
froze in the summer he was ravaged by mosquitoes because the 
prison refused to accept the netting his wife sent 
family packages are returned 
every spring festival holiday id go to the jail and wait at 
the gate with a bundle for him kang said no way if thats 
for xu wenli the guards said 
there have been small joys however 
miss xus school is just blocks from the jail and when the wind 
was right he could hear the students singing 
today you had a singing competition at school xu wrote in 
one letter i thought i heard your voice 
the next time i sang extra hard for him miss xu said 
but kang soon took her daughter from the school because the sons 
and daughters of many of the prison guards taunted her even my 
teacher kept asking me if my papa had come home miss xu said 
one day i told him yes and he scolded me for lying 
kang said recent letters indicate xus treatment has improved 
somewhat he is using paper she sent him and acknowledges receipt 
of their letters the prison also allowed him to write to his 
mother 
he doesnt know she died in 1987 kang said i wont tell 
him because im afraid it will hurt him so 
kang a teacher in a business school said she and her daughter 
were getting by ok on her monthly salary of around 100 yuan about 
27 
the real problem is with our spirits she said always 
dreaming of something that never happens it leaves us empty 
sometimes 
kang said her husband did nothing to deserve his punishment 
all he did was talk she said its such a brutal thing to 
do to a man just for a few words

one year into his term president roh 
taewoo has started to take a tough line against opponents calling 
off a referendum on his performance and cracking down on both 
dissidents and government hardliners 
roh who has tried to follow moderate policies and portray 
himself as a populist has not gained firm control of south koreas 
turbulent politics but the former general shows no sign of trying 
to backtrack on democratic reforms despite cracking down on the 
opposition he faces from the left and the right 
while there are no signs that roh could lose power south 
koreas chronic political unrest is likely to continue as the 
nation struggles to adjust to a democratic system after decades of 
authoritarian rule 
roh said radical groups were plotting to stage a violent leftist 
revolution when he stunned the nation march 20 by indefinitely 
postponing a referendum on his performance a referendum would lead 
to political chaos he said 
the people are worried leftist forces are trying to 
overthrow the free democratic system roh told the nation 
he ordered police to suppress the often violent demonstrations 
staged by radical students strikers farmers and other groups a 
government report said there were more than 7000 protests in 1988 
the government vowed further action after top dissident moon 
ikhwan made a secret visit march 25 to communist north korea for 
talks on reuniting the two nations enraged officials said 
dissidents were trying to aid north korea 
some political analysts said roh called off the referendum 
because he feared he could not win and a defeat probably would 
have forced the government to call new presidential elections 
if roh could have been sure of winning there is no reason he 
would not have gone ahead and swept away any doubt about his right 
to be president said an administration source who declined to 
be named 
roh who won presidential elections in december 1987 with 36 
percent of the vote is mistrusted by people suspicious of his 
close ties to former authoritarian president chun doohwan many 
koreans however are tired of politics after years of upheaval and 
dont want new instability analysts say 
roh has shielded chun against opposition demands the former 
president be made to account for corruption and human rights abuses 
under his rule the two took power with military backing in 1980 
dissidents and radical students who have called for rohs ouster 
are not seen as a major threat despite frequent violent 
demonstrations most analysts say because the radicals lack 
significant public support do to their extremism and violence 
the united national democratic movement a new dissident 
alliance that claims roh is a front for military rule has failed 
to gain strong public support and turnout for its rallies has been 
small 
roh ordered a crackdown on the radicals after criticism from 
conservatives about the administrations failure to end violent 
protests hardliners in the military have voiced strong concern 
over the way roh has handled leftists and violent laborers and 
students said political analyst park moojong 
the main opposition parties also have not played a big role the 
two main opposition parties headed by kim daejung and kim 
youngsam remain locked in a bitter rivalry that reduces their 
ability to work against the government 
roh also has started to move against hardliners within the 
government and military who have been critical of his moderate 
policies and worried that he may not be able to maintain public 
order 
government officials said wednesday that hardline generals in 
key posts were being retired or moved to lesser posts in a shakeup 
involving 49 generals the military which took power twice in the 
past has been a major political force in south koreas 40 year 
history 
the government reportedly is divided into moderates loyal to roh 
and rival hardliners unhappy that rapid democratic reforms are 
threatening their hold on power and allowing opposition groups to 
flourish causing social unrest 
roh is seeking ties with communist nations to ease tension with 
north korea hardliners are clinging to the anticommunism that 
dominated south korean policy for decades 
roh moved against his hardline critics after a series of 
incidents showed right wing opposition within the government was 
growing 
cabinet minister kim yongkap regarded as the leading hardliner 
in rohs government resigned in march to protest what he said was 
a growing threat from leftists i turned in my resignation to 
give a warning to people against the worsening political 
situation the former general said

president bush said today he will send 
congress in the next few days his recommendations for pay 
raises for top federal officials members of congress and judges 
bush made the commitment as the private national commission on 
public service suggested pay raises for federal officials virtually 
as high as the increases that congress killed in february 
neither bush nor white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
indicated what bushs recommendation would be 
this is very timely the president told members of the 
commission which is headed by former federal reserve chairman paul 
volcker in the next few days ill be making some very specific 
proposals 
fitzwater reiterated to reporters bushs view that there should 
be pay raises for federal executives judges and members of 
congress although he said no decisions had been made about 
recommendations to capitol hill 
fitzwater said that in the meeting bush had pointed out that 
it was important for the president to speak out and to set a tone 
and prevent a morale problem in the civil service but the 
spokesman also said im not aware of a morale problem 
house majority whip tony coelho however said he considered it 
unlikely that members of congress would be willing to consider 
another pay raise this year 
will something get done this year i doubt it said coelho 
dcalif in a telephone interview something needs to be done 
but im not at all optimistic 
the private study panel headed by volcker today recommended pay 
increases of approximately 50 percent over two years for these 
federal officials 
the pay increases suggested by volckers commission roughly 
parallel those called for by a congressionally created panel and 
endorsed by bush as well as his predecessor ronald reagan 
those increases were rejected by congress in the face of intense 
public criticism centering on the proposed pay raise for the 
lawmakers 
the private commission also recommended that congress prohibit 
its members from receiving speaking honoraria and other outside 
income related to their public responsibilities saying that 
otherwise the increase would be more likely to be perceived by 
the american people as excessive 
not only does such income create lingering doubts about the 
need for an acrosstheboard increase but it also undermines 
public trust in national institutions the panel said 
the commission which includes former president gerald r ford 
and former vice president walter f mondale among its 36 members 
also suggested pay increases for lowerranking government workers 
it recommended that these raises be phased in and the cost of 
them absorbed through reductions in employment or the elimination 
of government programs the commission recommended that pay for 
civil service workers be varied depending on the cost of living in 
different parts of the country 
volcker said that based on talks with some members of congress 
i do find some renewal of interest in the subject of pay 
increases 
sen charles robb dva a member of the commission said he 
detected on capitol hill a feeling that something needs to be 
done in all areas 
but he said some lawmakers strongly oppose the commissions 
recommendation that speaking honoraria for lawmakers be outlawed 
and that their salaries perhaps be considered separately from those 
of judges and executive branch officials 
dont underestimate a few committed souls robb said 
douglas fraser former president of the united automobile 
workers and a member of the commission said that organized labor 
generally supports the commissions report but disagrees with the 
proposal that pay vary from locality to locality it creates in 
many cases gross inequalities fraser said 
george king director of public relations for the national 
treasury employees union said the commissions report really 
doesnt address the lowergrade or rankandfile federal 
employees 
it holds out the false hope that pay increases for these 
people can be absorbed in current agency budgets or through 
reductions in force king said 
he said that his organization which claims to represent 144000 
federal workers seeks annual pay raises of 6 percent or 3 percent 
above inflation whichever is larger and advocates 
agencybyagency bargaining 
the commission was formed after a conference held in washington 
in 1987 by the liberal brookings institution and the conservative 
american enterprise institute 
it reported that the purchasing power of executive judicial and 
legislative salaries has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 and 
recommnded that they be restored to the 1969 purchasing power 
level this would require an increase of about 50 percent 
the commission recommended that 25 percent of the increase be 
granted now and the rest by the beginning of the new congress in 
1991 if congress is unable to act on its own salaries even though 
they are phased in and accompanied by a ban on speaking fees the 
commission recommended that the president submit separate pay 
raises for judges and senior executives 
if increases for senior political employees are delayed the 
president and congress should raise a current limit on toplevel 
career employees even if this means that they make more than the 
political appointees who are above them the commission said

attorney general dick thornburgh today said 
127 people have been charged in investigation he said smashed a 
billiondollar international moneylaundering ring with links to 
the medellin drug cartel of colombia 
thornburgh called it the largest moneylaundering crackdown 
ever carried out by the federal government 
authorities seized a halfton of cocaine and 45 million in 
cash jewelry and real estate and have identified more assets for 
potential seizure he said 
there is no more effective way to deal with the business of 
drug trafficking than to take the profit out of it thats what has 
happened with operation polar cap thornburgh said at a news 
conference 
federal authorities also obtained conspiracy indictments against 
two south american banks banco de occidente of panama and banco de 
occidente of colombia on charges they were involved in laundering 
more than 1 billion in drug proceeds generated in the united 
states 
appearing with thornburgh was fbi director william sessions 
drug enforcement administrator john lawn and other federal 
authorities lawn said the sophisticated and complicated 
moneylaundering operation laundered 12 billion in two years 
thornburgh called it a very hostile takeover of a major 
moneylaundering operation 
lawn said federal investigators in atlanta were told by 
drugworld leaders that the moneylaundering scheme they were 
operating undercover was processing the money too slowly and 
described a faster los angelesbased operation that could launder 
their money in 48 hours 
he said it was called la mina or the mine and that 
authorities began investigating that operation he said it involved 
transfers of drugproceeds and laundered money through several 
cities and panama colombia and uruguay 
the justice department said that among the indictments resulting 
from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed 
today in atlanta and eight people arrested tuesday evening in new 
york 
bruce pagel an attorney in the departments narcotics section 
said most of the 127 people charged in the investigation had been 
arrested but that authorities were still pursuing some 
the department said the atlanta indictment traces the 
establishment of the moneylaundering enterprise directly to 
leaders of the colombian medellin cartel which authorities say is 
the source of 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this country 
federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in atlanta miami 
new york and san francisco and additional arrests were expected in 
new york los angeles and miami the department said 
thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegal activity by 
us banks and that the banks cooperated in the investigation 
lawn said authorities also hoped to make an arrest today in 
panama with the help of the panamanian defense forces thornburgh 
said federal authorities continued to cooperate with the force 
despite the pending federal drug indictment against panamanian 
leader manuel noriega

a new tabloid hits the streets this fall 
offering st louis the prospect of an oldfashioned newspaper war 
the established paper already has served notice it wont concede 
so much as one reader to the upstart 
ralph ingersoll ii on tuesday announced plans for a visually 
dynamic paper called the st louis sun he said it will be 
published seven mornings a week and will be competitive with the 
111yearold st louis postdispatch from day one 
the sun will be profitable in the second year of its 
operation and it will continue to grow he predicted ingersoll 
publications co publishes more than 40 daily newspapers and more 
than 150 nondaily papers in the united states and europe 
the postdispatch owned by the pulitzer family since its 
inception has been the citys only daily newspaper since the st 
louis globedemocrat folded under financial strain in 1986 
competition is the way of life in the american system said 
joseph pulitzer jr postdispatch chairman but he added well 
beat the pants off them 
ingersoll chairman and chief executive of ingersoll 
publications will start his venture with the help of a top 
postdispatch executive who resigned from that paper tuesday 
morning thomas m tallarico 44 a senior vice president and 
general manager of the postdispatch since 1986 will be publisher 
of the sun 
the postdispatchs mission will remain the same as will its 
character said editor william f woo competition focuses 
competition sharpens and competition quickens all of those things 
are good for newspapers or any other business but i am not 
prepared to concede one single reader to ralph ingersoll 
ingersoll would not divulge startup costs but said the first 
run of the newspaper will be 200000 copies he said the newspaper 
could be profitable with a circulation of fewer than 100000 
weekday paid circulation for the postdispatch is about 378000 
with 554000 copies on sundays 
it has been an old saw that big cities can really only have 
one successful newspaper mayor vincent c schoemehl jr said 
i think a new sense of competitiveness new technology and a new 
aggressiveness in the media industry makes that old saw sawdust 
it can only help to have another public voice said charles 
klotzer editor of the st louis journalism review the big thing 
is are they going to get the big advertisers but as a whole its 
very encouraging

federal regulators said wednesday they had 
seized control of most of mcorp an 18 billion dallasbased bank 
holding company pumping in 300 million in what will likely become 
the third largest commercial bank rescue ever 
the federal deposit insurance corp packaged 20 mcorp subsidiary 
banks into a new governmentowned institution with 154 billion 
in assets and 116 billion in deposits left alone were five 
stillsolvent subsidiary banks and a trust company 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic which insures 
commercial bank deposits up to 100000 said the agency will seek 
buyers for the new institution 
he declined to estimate how much government aid will ultimately 
be required saying he did not want to reveal the figure to 
potential bidders 
private analysts have said they expect the failure will cost the 
fdic already depleted by a postdepression record of 221 bank 
failures last year 1 billion to 2 billion 
that would make the transaction the third most costly commercial 
bank rescue after continental illinois of chicago in 1984 and 
first republicbank of dallas in 1988 which required initial 
government pledges of 45 billion and 4 billion respectively 
both like mcorp were holding companies 
the fdic insurance fund suffered its first loss ever in 1988 
declining from 183 billion to 14 billion seidman said the fund 
should break even this year even with spending for mcorp 
as part of legislation to bail out the savings and loan 
industry president bush is proposing to build up the commercial 
bank insurance fund by nearly doubling the deposit insurance 
premium paid by banks 
earlier this year when the fdic was trying to sell mcorp in its 
entirety the agency had set an april 3 deadline for offers but 
seidman said that may be extended 
we are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as 
possible he said 
in dallas mcorp said the five remaining banks and the trust 
subsidiary form the nucleus of a new beginning for mcorp which 
intends to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
while the nature of mcorp has been altered dramatically a 
solid healthy core remains chairman gene h bishop said 
seidman said the failed banks opened for business today and as 
far as the customers are concerned it will be business as usual 
mcorp which has 86 offices lost 903 million from its banking 
operations last year it is the last of the large texas banks 
needing to be recapitalized either through federal rescue or 
private merger the bulk of the assets were in the subsidiaries in 
dallas 64 billion and houston 32 billion 
until last year many analysts had thought mcorp which had not 
invested as heavily in energy projects as other texas banks might 
survive but heavy losses on real estate loans evenutally dragged 
it under 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke the chief regulator 
of nationally chartered banks said the failures were triggered by 
demands beginning monday on the lead bank in dallas both from 
depositors and from the other banks in the holding company 
on tuesday it became clear as the day wore on that the 
dallas bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of 
depositors clarke said five of the banks had been insolvent on 
their 15 more failed after the dallas bank could not meet their 
demands for deposits the demands of all outside customers were 
met he said 
federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators 
legally could not take control of the five mcorp subsidiary banks 
that remain solvent a legal battle is developing between private 
creditors and the fdic over assets held by the holding company 
regulators claim holding company assests should be used to defer 
federal costs in rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks but mcorp 
has resisted 
seidman declined to say how large the claim against the holding 
company is except that it is substantial the insurance fund 
last year had been trying to force the holding company to inject 
400 million into 18 of its banks 
for future cases the fdic is seeking legislation from congress 
that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up 
sister institutions that fail 
the fdics move came a week after creditors of mcorp forced it 
to seek protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the holding company had halted payments on 466 million in debt 
last october but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their 
claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with 
the fdic 
the fdic appointed james gardner chairman of mbank dallas as 
president of its new governmentowned institution the agency said 
it will seek a new chairman from outside the mcorp system 
reportedly among those interested in buying mcorp is a robert 
abboud chairman of houstons first city bancorporation which was 
itself rescued by the fdic in 1987 with 1 billion 
other likely bidders are kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 
pritzker family of chicago and a group led by harry gray former 
chairman of united technologies corp 
the 20 mcorp banks seized are mbank abilene mbank alamo mbank 
austin mbank brenham mbank corsicana mbank dallas mbank denton 
county mbank fort worth mbank greenville mbank houston mbank 
jefferson mbank longview mbank marshall mbank midcities mbank 
odessa mbank orange mbank round rock mbank sherman mbank 
wichita falls and mbank the woodlands 
the five banks remaining solvent are mbank brownsville mbank 
corpus christi mbank waco mbank el paso and mbank new braunfels 
a sixth subsidiary mtrust corp also remains solvent

the government reported wednesday that its 
chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 03 percent in february 
corroborating other signs of a slowdown in the economic expansion 
last months decline in the index of leading economic 
indicators a composite of forwardlooking business statistics was 
matched by a comparable dip last september and was the biggest drop 
since a fall of 08 percent last july 
analysts said februarys decline was consistent with other 
recent signals that the economy may be losing steam welcome news 
to those who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation from 
spiraling 
this should reduce concern about the economy overheating 
while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of a 
recession said jerry jasinowski chief economist for the 
national association of manufacturers 
others however are concerned that the economy will slow too 
much and that the federal reserve boards yearlong campaign to 
raise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stifle 
growth altogether 
the monetary tightening that we have experienced and some 
monetary tightening that is probably still to come are going to 
cause a downturn said economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch 
amp co in new york i think that were going to have a recession 
by the end of the year 
steinberg said fed policymakers are doing what they have to 
do to cure inflation with a recession likely to be the 
unintended side effect 
last months drop in the leading index added to a series of 
government reports on the economys performance in february that 
pointed downward including decreases in manufacturing employment 
housing construction and orders for durable goods 
in other evidence of a weakening economy the commerce 
department reported wednesday that sales of new singlefamily 
homes in february plunged 94 percent to their lowest level in more 
than a year 
analysts blame the slow sales pace on the pinch of higher 
mortgage interest rates which forced some lowerincome buyers out 
of the market 
the first people forced out of the market in times of rising 
rates are firsttime buyers who barely qualify to buy a home 
said john tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors 
the leading index designed to foretell economic activity six to 
nine months into the future had advanced 06 percent in december 
and 07 percent in january after vacillating during much of 1988 
economist john hagens of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
said the latest decline in the index was not enough evidence to 
signal a future recession but is consistent with our view that 
we are going to have a period of prolonged slowing of growth 
beginning in the second half of this year and carrying through the 
first half of next year 
whether the slowdown turns into a recession will depend on how 
deftly the fed maneuvers as it tries to slow growth just enough to 
bring inflation under control hagens said 
in february eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading 
index declined with the biggest negative factor being a drop in 
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment 
the other negative factors were a drop in building permits a 
decline in manufacturers orders for consumer goods a contraction 
in the money supply a dip in an index of consumer expectations an 
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits faster vendor 
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in 
manufacturers unfilled orders 
two indicators made positive contributions an increase in 
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand and rising 
stock prices one indicator was unchanged last month the length of 
the average work week 
the various changes left the index at 1452 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater noted that the index stands 35 percent ahead of where it 
was a year ago adding one months figures dont provide a real 
basis for judging any change in that trend 
the traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three 
straight declines in the leading index the components of the 
composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting 
abilities but when the new index is applied retroactively it 
flashes two false recession signals since the last economic 
downturn in 198182

the western which seemed to have choked

starred in many of the old films 
time was said ireland when youd see a guy on one 
channel saying put em up and could change channels and another 
guy would answer him 
but people lost interest in the 1950s cowboy series such as 
rawhide gunsmoke and wagon train when out of the west 
came the police show 
cops do most of the tv killing of bad guys these days ireland 
said but the popularity of the miniseries lonesome dove and a 
recent movie based on televisions bonanza indicate a rebirth 
is occurring 
ireland 75 is one of the featured guests at the fourth annual 
riders of the silver screen a threeday celebration beginning 
thursday in knoxville 
events include old western movie showings a recreated gunfight

heading into the final three weeks of the tax 
preparation season more than half of americans still had not 
mailed their tax returns the internal revenue service said 
wednesday 
through last friday the irs had received 531 million returns 
up 07 percent from 528 million during the same period a year ago 
the irs expects 109 million individual returns will be filed this 
year although several million of them will not come in by the 
april 17 deadline 
nearly 32 million returns are expected in the final two weeks of 
the season but the irs isnt worried about a crush that 
represents almost 30 percent of the total about the same as in 
past years the agency said 
while filings are up slightly the irs is processing returns 33 
percent faster than a year ago the agency said 424 million 
returns have made their way through the system compared with just 
under 411 million during the same period last year 
more than 74 percent of the processed returns have been 
certified for refunds totaling 256 billion an average refund of 
almost 816 at this time last year 75 percent of filers had 
refunds approved those refunds average 817 
refunds are still going out within six weeks but those who 
file closer to the deadline will probably have to wait longer for 
their refund the irs said 
the statistic that pleases irs most is one showing that the 
number of taxpayers filing returns electronically is more than 
double last years through march 23 the irs had received 981107 
electronic returns compared with 464284 at the same time a year 
ago 
electronic filing is available in most states this year but only 
for returns that are due a refund the return must be filed through 
a professional preparer who has been licensed by the irs 
such a return saves the irs considerable paperwork and 
processing expense and can produce a refund within two or three 
weeks 
another trend that was spotted early this year is continuing 
fewer taxpayers are calling the irs with specific tax questions at 
this time last year the irs tollfree phones had received 206 
million calls that is down to 193 million this year 
the irs has no way of knowing whether that dropoff was caused by 
widespread publicity about the agencys high error rate in 
answering questions which in some areas has approached 50 percent 
the number of taxpayers taking advantage of another type of 
telephone assistance teletax exceeds 15 million this year 
compared with 54 million at this time a year ago 
teletax whose tollfree numbers and subject list are included 
in the back of the instruction packages mailed by the irs offers 
taperecorded advice on more than 140 tax topics

fishermen in a mosquito fleet of small 
vessels worked with booms rakes and shovels to save their 
livelihood today while accusing exxon of botching the cleanup of 
the nations worstever oil spill 
the lastditch effort concentrated on the southwest portion of 
oncepristine prince william sound fishermen said they hope to 
protect important salmon hatcheries 
one estimate put the seasons losses at more than 150 million 
as a result of the spill which occurred friday when the exxon 
valdez ran onto a reef and leaked 240000 barrels of the 12 
million aboard the tanker 
there is definitely a sense of hopelessness that cant be 
avoided said jack lamb acting president of the cordova district 
fishermen united exxon did screw up no doubt about it but what 
were trying to do is maintain our focus and get this thing cleaned 
up 
our feelings have to be set aside to get this cleaned up then 
we can start dealing with the companies 
in washington today white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
today cited good cooperation in the effort to stop the oil 
slick in prince william sound and suggested a federal takeover of 
the cleanup may not be necessary 
fitzwater said transportation secretary samuel skinner talked 
with president bush from alaska and reported that things were 
more positive than they might have believed 
skinner is in alaska with adm paul yost commandant of the 
coast guard and william reilly administrator of the environmental 
protection agency bush sent them because of conflicting reports on 
whether exxon was doing enough 
exxon was assisted by the state the coast guard and local 
fishermen in trying to clean up the slick and protect hundreds of 
pristine islands in its path 
since the tanker ran aground friday the 101 million gallons of 
crude oil have moved more than 40 miles contaminating some beaches 
and marine life in the wildliferich sound 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi conceded earlier this 
week that the cleanup is not proceeding well believe me that 
is an understatement weve got a mess on our hands 
gov steve cowper today said exxons response to the spill was 
so late and inadequate that authorities are losing hope of cleaning 
up the mess 
just about all we can do is to act in specific areas for 
instance were trying to save the hatchery areas he said on 
abcs good morning america 
cowper a democrat said it was the oil companys legal duty to 
respond first to the spill and they didnt do a good job to put 
it charitably 
i think clearly in the beginning the response was very poor 
he said then the weather got bad for a day or so i think now 
the efforts being coordinated farily well but its pretty late 
mayor john devens said i think the hatcheries are saveable i 
think thats where the effort has to be placed now we think 
weve probably lost our herring season were likely to lose a good 
bit of our salmon season the value just the fishing season is 
going to be in excess of 150 million 
the san diego union meanwhile reported today that the exxon 
valdez was built without a dual bottom which can lessen the risk 
of a puncture causing a leak 
its a question of economics its much cheaper to build a 
singleskin ship said lt cmdr woody loveland who was the 
coast guards chief marine safety officer in san diego when the 
valdez was built 
many tankers were constructed with protective hulls in 
anticipation of regulations requiring them loveland said but the 
design feature was dropped for some ships when it became evident 
such a requirement would not be enacted 
though industry sources agree that double bottoms prevent spills 
under certain circumstances their effectiveness remains open to 
debate when ships run hard into rocks or other obstructions as the 
valdez apparently did 
richard s golob publisher of golobs oil pollution bulletin 
said most tankers have single bottoms a double bottom although 
it provides an additional level of safety does not necessarily 
provide a cureall in the event of a major accident he said 
in the fishing village of cordova 50 miles to the southeast 
angry residents packed a high school gymnasium tuesday night for a 
meeting with state and exxon officials many of the towns 2500 
residents had opposed using valdez as the southern terminus for the 
alaskan pipeline 
resident marla adkins said the oil industry had promised to have 
adequate equipment on hand to handle any spills 
what happened here is not what we were told would happen 10 
years ago she said 
fisherman john booren said he feared publicity about the spill 
would destroy the market for the areas fish even if the damage 
were contained

the state house today debated whether 
to censure rather than impeach treasurer a james manchin for his 
handling of an investment fund that lost 279 million 
delegate james pitrolo manchins chief defender asked for 
censure telling fellow lawmakers they were standing here today 
on the threshold of history you will decide how we will be judged 
for the rest of our political lives 
the house judiciary committee in a 177 vote monday 
recommended 18 articles of impeachment against manchin if the 
house impeaches manchin and the senate convicts him he will lose 
his job and possibly his pension estimated at 2128 a month 
i have not harmed the people of this state in any way at all 
there has been no proof of malfeasance i do know that justice will 
prevail the 61yearold manchin a twoterm democrat said 
tuesday 
before pitrolo spoke democratic delegate ramona cerra told the 
house she received three threatening telephone calls tuesday night 
she did not detail the nature of the threats or say from whom they 
came 
the house also was to consider a censure motion against auditor 
glen gainer 60 a fourterm democrat he and manchin served on the 
board of investments which had general supervision of the fund 
some delegates predicted a wide margin in favor of impeachment 
which requires a simple majority but pitrolo said the vote would 
be close 
im giving them an option to look at the evidence and arrive 
at a decision that while the evidence is not strong enough to 
warrant impeachment there was evidence that some sort of action 
should be taken pitrolo said 
delegate marc harman who is leading the impeachment effort 
called it a heart and mind issue an emotional issue 
the impeachment resolution said manchin failed to supervise the 
states consolidated investment fund which was under the control 
of his office it accused him for delegating too much authority 
making improper investments paying out interest that was not 
earned and covering up the losses 
senate president larry tucker has notified the senate to be 
ready to hear the case in late may if the house votes to impeach 
twentythree of the 34 senators would have to vote to convict

a new study concludes that skewing the census 
bureaus national headcount as has been proposed in various forms 
by lawmakers and special interest groups would make little 
difference in the allocation of house seats 
population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift 
of 18 or more seats various experts agree 
but even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift 
a maximum of just four additional seats among california 
pennsylvania kentucky and minnesota population analyst william p 
ohare reports 
it appears that none of the adjustments to census figures that 
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference 
in the overall apportionment of congress ohare reported in the 
latest issue of population today the newsletter of the private 
population reference bureau 
the census taken every 10 years is required by the 
constitution to redistribute the 435 house seats keeping them 
relatively even in population because the number of house members 
is limited whenever a state gains a seat another state must lose 
one 
last year the commerce department which oversees the census 
bureau decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted 
various interest groups however continue to push the idea 
several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to 
force changes 
the main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either 
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been 
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people 
who are imputed 
imputed people are those counted despite the fact that census 
officials do not actually contact them for example when neighbors 
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker 
repeatedly cannot locate those people that person is counted 
the suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in 
us district court in brooklyn by new york los angeles chicago 
dade county fla the naacp and groups representing hispanics and 
the nations mayors 
a separate suit seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens 
was filed in us district court in pittsburgh by the immigration 
reform law institute on behalf of 42 members of congress 
pennsylvania kansas alabama and the federation for american 
immigration reform 
an analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5 
percent of blacks and hispanics were missed considerably more than 
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted thus 
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each 
state by a predetermined percentage 
such a move would be expected to benefit states with large 
minority populations but ohares calculations said that would not 
be the case 
interestingly concluded ohare minority undercount 
adjustment the modification of the census figures which has 
received the most attention would not result in the movement of 
any seats between states 
on the other hand he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens 
from the count would result in the transfer of one house seat from 
california to pennsylvania 
this is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 census 
figures for california included an estimated 1 million illegal 
aliens ohare commented taking them out of the california 
population would cost that state a house seat pennsylvania would 
be next in line for that seat 
some states are more difficult to count and thus have more 
imputed people than others ohare found he estimated that 
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost kentucky a 
seat once again the gainer would be pennsylvania 
ohare also calculated the results of various combinations of 
these adjustments 
adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting 
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from minnesota to 
pennsylvania 
adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would 
transfer seats from kentucky and minnesota to pennsylvania and 
california 
subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move 
one house seat from california to pennsylvania 
making all three adjustments would move one seat from 
california to pennsylvania 
the various changes calculated by ohare would be in addition to 
reallocartions of house seats caused by discernable shifts in 
population since 1980 
while the exact shifts wont be known until after the census 
the population reference bureau and the private election data 
service have projected changes based on recent census bureau 
population estimates 
both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern 
states to the south and west mirroring the flow of population 
gainers are expected to be california 5 texas 4 florida 3 
arizona 2 georgia 2 north carolina 1 and virginia 1 
expected to lose seats are new york 3 pennsylvania 3 
illinois 2 michigan 2 ohio 2 iowa 1 kansas 1 
massachusetts 1 montana 1 west virginia 1 and wisconsin 1

the benevolent and loyal order of

too much optimism says president jack duvall 
the group has been meeting each year since 1975 on a weekend 
closest to april 15 income tax day and also the anniversary of the 
sinking of the titanic which duvall calls a monument to 
optimism 
we just dont think you should get unrealistic hopes up 
duvall said youll only make yourself unhappy 
duvall which is not his real name said he didnt want to 
divulge his identity or have his picture taken because he was 
worried about losing his job 
the club which he says has a worldwide membership in the 
midthree digits formed by happenstance 
a group of about a dozen friends met 14 years ago in a small 
restaurant in tiffin iowa to celebrate a friends 30th birthday 
duvall said also meeting at the restaurant was a group of 
optimists 
after a few drinks some words were exchanged and we decided 
the world really needed a pessimists group to counteract the 
influence of these bizarre optimists and their strange rituals 
at the annual conference winners of the pessimist of the 
year award get a nice trophy in the shape of the rear end of a

the death toll from clashes between 
police and ethnic albanians in a southern province climbed to 23 on 
wednesday when two wounded demonstrators died the state news 
agency said 
there were reports of attempted strikes and scattered street 
protests but the region was relatively calm for the first day in 
about a week a dusktodawn curfew remained in force and state tv 
showed army tanks and jets on maneuver in kosovo province 
police sources and witnesses meanwhile said the ferocity of 
the clashes in the province on monday and tuesday caught security 
forces off guard 
radmilo bogdanovic serbias interior minister told officials 
in belgrade on wednesday that only 2400 police were deployed 
monday against an estimated 14000 ethnic albanian demonstrators in 
kosovo 
although ethnic tension between serbs and albanians had been 
simmering for some time few expected the protesters and police to 
open fire on each other with handguns and automatic weapons as they 
did in cities towns and villages 
one police officer said in an interview wednesday that he was so 
frightened by the violence he stole a license plate from a wrecked 
civilian vehicle and put it on his police car so he could escape 
the fighting 
other officers who also demanded anonymity said demonstrators 
commandeered a bulldozer to attack security forces 
near pristina ethnic albanians strafed a police helicopter from 
a minaret during the fighting monday and tuesday police and 
witnesses said 
in the town of decani where about 1000 people battled police 
for two hours tuesday demonstrators injured 14 policemen by 
shooting from rooftops and the windows of buildings the state news 
agency tanjug said wednesday 
in all 23 people were killed and 74 injured that official 
death toll is the highest reported from ethnic unrest in kosovo 
since the end of world war ii in 1981 at least nine people died 
in ethnic riots whose anniversary will be celebrated on saturday 
the latest protests in kosovo which is part of the republic of 
serbia began last week after kosovos parliament approved 
constitutional changes giving serbia control of the provincial 
police courts and civil defense 
serbia said the changes are needed to protect the provinces 
slav minority from persecution at the hands of ethnic albanians 
ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent of kosovos 19 million 
citizens say the changes threaten autonomy they won under the 1974 
constitution 
tanjug reported scattered attempts at strikes and street 
protests wednesday the first day of relative calm in the province 
since kosovos parliament passed the disputed constitutional 
changes thursday 
tanjug said police dispersed about 150 youths and detained 18 
who tried to march to the center of the west kosovo town of pec no 
injuries were reported 
police patrols thinned slightly in pristina by late wednesday 
two policemen a serb and an ethnic albanian were buried in 
two kosovo villages while police kept guard with sovietmade t55 
tanks 
alia shexholija the communist party chief in the kosovo town of 
podujevo was quoted in the belgrade daily politika ekspres as 
saying the security forces reacted too mildly at the start of 
mondays clashes 
police were not equipped to face such aggression and didnt even 
have bulletproof vests he said other papers reported that one 
injured officer died because his colleagues were unable to evacuate 
him quickly

president bush on wednesday embraced a private 
commissions report calling for federal pay increases as very 
timely and said he will promptly ask congress to raise the pay of 
top executive branch officials senators representatives and 
judges 
bush spoke after receiving the recommendations of the national 
commission on public service a 36member panel headed by former 
federal reserve chairman paul volcker the group called for steps 
to make government jobs more attractive including a pay raise 
nearly as large as the one congress killed last month after public 
outcries over its magnitude 
neither bush nor white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
indicated what bushs recommendation would be it would have to be 
enacted by congress 
this is very timely the president told members of the 
commission in the next few days ill be making some very 
specific proposals 
volcker would not speculate on whether he believed congress 
would endorse an increase but said that based on talks with 
lawmakers i do find some renewal of interest in the subject 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif was more pessimistic 
saying will something get done this year i doubt it something 
needs to be done but im not at all optimistic 
the commissions pay proposal is similar to one made in the 
final weeks of the reagan administration by a congressionally 
created commission that assesses federal pay every four years both 
thenpresident reagan and bush endorsed that proposed 51 percent 
increase but it foundered on public opposition to a congressional 
pay raise 
the volcker commission plan proposes some new wrinkles 
for one thing only 25 per cent of the increase would be 
effective immediately the rest would wait until a new congress 
convenes in 1991 
for another members of congress would have to give up the 
speaking fees or honoraria with which many supplement their 
incomes 
not only does such income create lingering doubts about the 
need for an acrosstheboard increase but it also undermines 
public trust in national institutions the panel said 
the commission also recommended pay increases for rankandfile 
federal employees but suggested they be absorbed into existing 
budgets by reductions in force and elimination of programs it also 
suggested that the pay rates vary from locality to locality based 
on the cost of living 
spokesmen for organized labor reacted coolly to this proposal 
john n sturdivant national president of the american 
federation of government employees endorsed the report as far as 
it goes adding unfortunately it is a jigsaw puzzle with some 
of the most important pieces missing 
he said that besides giving raises to executives nonmanagement 
federal workers must also have their salaries raised to the level 
of their private sector counterparts 
only after such action is taken can locality pay play a 
realistic role in bringing equity to federal workers sturdivant 
said 
douglas fraser former president of the united automobile 
workers and a member of the commission said that organized labor 
generally supports the commissions report but disagrees with the 
proposal that pay vary from locality to locality it creates in 
many cases gross inequalities fraser said 
among other recommendations 
the president should set the highest standards of ethical 
conduct for those who hold the public trust and act quickly and 
firmly to remove those who violate that trust 
the financial disclosure process while a key protection 
against conflicts of interest should be streamlined to ease the 
burdens on potential appointees 
the number of presidential political appointees should be 
reduced from the current level of about 3000 to about 2000 and 
career officials should more frequently be considered for 
subcabinet appointments 
the president and congress should establish a public service 
scholarship program open to 1000 students who would receive 
tuition and costs in return for a commitment to a specified term of 
government service

the bush administration is leaning against a 
federal takeover of the cleanup of the nations largest oil spill 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
although no final decision has yet been made on additional steps 
to battle the spreading oil slick in alaskas prince william sound 
we would not rush into that step quickly fitzwater said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner part of a highlevel 
team of us officials sent to study the oil spill from the 
grounded tanker exxon valdez gave a preliminary report to 
president bush by phone fitzwater said 
it was a brief conversation but secretary skinner reported 
good cooperation between the various authorities involved 
fitzwater said 
he said skinner reported things were more positive than they 
might have believed 
skinner is at the site with coast guard adm paul yost and 
william reilly administrator of the environmental protection 
agency they are due back on thursday and will give a report to the 
president fitzwater said 
exxon which is charged by law with the cleanup operation was 
being assisted by the state the coast guard and local fishermen in 
trying to contain the growing 100squaremile slick and protect 
hundreds of pristine islands in its path 
bush on tuesday had said there were conflicting reports on 
whether exxon was doing enough to try to contain damage from the 
oil spill and said that a federal takeover of the cleanup was one 
option 
however fitzwater told reporters on wednesday that i would 
guide you a little bit away from that the preliminary feeling is 
that the resources are there on the job and that the cleanup is 
probably as effective is it would be under federal supervision 
however he said there have been conflicting reports on 
exxons role thats why theyre up there he said referring 
to the federal officials 
the spill was caused after the oil tanker ran aground on friday 
spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil 
the various parties there are working together the governors 
office exxon and local fishermen are making a lot of efforts to 
bring in local citizens to help with the cleanup effort the 
white house spokesman said 
the three officials flew over the spill on tuesday after their 
arrival then met with exxon officials and with alaska gov steve 
cowper a democrat who had criticized exxons response as slow and 
inadequate 
the us team fitzwater said didnt have any conclusions to 
report at this point other than to say there was good cooperation 
among the cleanup parties involved there that everyone appeared to 
be dedicated and working as hard as possible 
bush has said that the oil spill would not diminish his support 
for a plan open a pristine arctic wildlife refuge to oil drilling 
fitzwater on wednesday reiterated the administrations support 
for oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge on 
alaskas northern reaches 
hes saying his general policy hasnt changed he doesnt want 
to signal any kind of other peripheral changes at this point until 
we know what weve learned from the oil spill fitzwater said 
it may well be we could learn things that would be applicable

local politics overwhelmed even heavy 
white house campaigning in a special congressional election in 
which democrats wrested away the seat once held by vice president 
dan quayle 
jill long a business professor used two county tax issues in 
her successful race against gop opponent dan heath a former city 
official 
longs 1700vote margin tuesday reversed her fortunes from last 
fall when she lost the district race by 50000 votes 
heath wanted to take the george bush tax pledge but he had 
been in an administration involved in a tax raise said brad 
senden a consultant to longs campaign so he was immediately 
involved in a contradiction 
heath was safety director under fort wayne mayor paul helmke 
who recently engineered the passage of a 02 percent city income 
tax and sought annexation of a republicandominated county 
township a move that would mean higher property tax rates 
long used both issues in her advertising claiming the 
administrations tactics belied heaths campaign promise not to 
support tax increases 
in his concession speech heath conceded the attacks hurt his 
candidacy there are times when one must be sacrificed on the 
altar of good government whether it be tax or annexation he 
said 
long said her victory was not a rebuff for the white house or 
quayle who campaigned for heath this was just a race between 
two individuals in northeast indiana she said 
quayle called long with congratulations and offered to assist 
in any way because hes committed to the fourth district she 
said 
later long seemed to back away even from her campaigns tax 
issue attacks saying the city administrations chief failure was 
not seeking broader resident involvement in the decision its a 
style of management rather than the issue itself she said 
long had lost by landslide margins in 1986 and in her 1988 
effort to oust gop incumbent dan coats some democrats wrote off 
her political career after the second loss but long said she 
realized coats a former house aide to quayle might be appointed 
to fill his senate seat we kept our campaign headquarters open 
and assembled a team of private advisers she said 
long had no opponents in the party nominating caucus while 
heath then relatively unknown even in the city was running in a 
field of nine candidates 
long becomes the first democrat to hold the northeastern indiana 
seat since j edward roush lost to quayle in a 1976 reelection 
campaign long said her thoughts had not turned to the reelection 
effort that begins soon in a shortened 19month term

with songs bells and balloons oklahoma is 
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the biggest land run in 
history 
the big blowout will come april 22 and mark the actual 
anniversary of the scramble by an estimated 40000 people for 2 
million acres of indian territory opened to white settlement 
on tuesday school children and others in more than a halfdozen 
cities and towns watched a horseback rider reenact the dispatching 
of president benjamin harrisons march 23 1889 proclamation 
offering the free land 
planners figured that a century ago it probably took until march 
28 for the news to travel to oklahoma from washington dc 
the observance should help people understand that oklahoma 
history did not begin with the land run of 1889 and that indians 
settled the area first and made it hospitable cherokee chief wilma 
mankiller said 
the celebration was pretty dadgummed nice charles owens 
chairman of the crescent centennial commission 
we had over 100 direct descendants of 89ers those who had 
made the run owens said they registered with their name and 
the name of the ancestor who made the run 
then each of those decendants took one stroke on the 
centennial bell that stands outside centennial headquarters in 
crescent a town of 1700 he said 
from there the proclamation was carried by horseback to 
guthrie stillwater norman kingfisher el reno and oklahoma city 
in guthrie the original state capital the langston university 
choir and band offered patriotic music on the steps of the scottish 
rite temple 
camp fire boys and girls released hundreds of balloons carrying 
messages announcing the opening of the unassigned lands 
in el reno on the other side of that onceforbidden zone the 
centennial rider was intercepted by the cavalry and accused of 
being a sooner one of those who didnt wait for the official 
opening us marshals threw the rider in jail as part of the 
spectacle 
more balloons were released at norman and at kingfisher a 
girls choir in period dress sang original songs and the american 
legion fired a 21gun salute 
coincidentally the nations secondlargest indian tribe the 
cherokees are planning a more somber observance this weekend of 
the 150th anniversary of a forced march to oklahoma from their 
homes in the southeast the march along a path known as the trail 
of tears ended in march 1839

sales of new singlefamily homes slumped in 
february to the lowest level in more than a year the government 
said wednesday and analysts expect further declines as rising 
mortgage rates push more people out of the market 
sales dropped 94 percent in february to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of 626000 after advancing 25 percent in january when 
unusually mild weather brought out more buyers 
the drop in sales was accompanied by an 89 percent increase in 
the median price of the homes sold which analysts said showed that 
lowerincome purchasers were the ones who left the market 
the first people forced out of the market in times of rising 
rates are firsttime buyers who barely qualify to buy a home 
said john tuccillo chief economist of the national association of 
realtors 
last months median price for a new home was 123100 meaning 
half the homes sold for more and half for less the average price 
which is pulled up by sales of very expensive homes was up 92 
percent to 150200 
analysts said that because the housing market is particularly 
sensitive to interest rates it is among the sectors of the economy 
most directly affected as the federal reserve board tries to 
restrain growth and dampen inflationary pressures by driving rates 
upward 
housing construction and sales of existing homes also were down 
sharply during february according to earlier reports from the 
commerce department 
the housing sector is stumbling said economist bruce 
steinberg of merrill lynch amp co in new york its an indication 
that higher mortgage rates are taking a toll on the housing sector 
one which is likely to intensify over the next couple of months 
fixedrate home mortgages last week were averaging 1122 
percent up from 999 percent a year earlier according to a 
national survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
oneyear adjustable rate mortgages also were up sharply with 
lenders asking an average initial rate of 93 percent last week up 
from 752 percent a year earlier freddie mac said 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said the decline in home sales reflected the higher 
interest rates and probably some slowing in the economy 
it was the biggest decline since a 95 percent drop last 
november and left sales at the lowest rate since the 576000 level 
of january 1988 
tuccillo said that with mortgage rates expected to continue 
rising through the spring new home sales likely will decline 
further over the next few months and then start to pick up 
dave seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders said sales for all of 1989 are expected to be down 6 
percent from last year but the situation could be worse if the fed 
tightens credit too severely 
our association is very uptight about what the fed has been 
doing seiders said when the fed moves to slow down an economy 
like this they almost always overshoot 
the biggest drop in new home sales last month was recorded in 
the northeast where sales dropped 199 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 101000 the northeast market has weakened 
after several years in which strong sales resulted in overbuilding 
and inflated prices 
sales last month were off 144 percent in the south to an annual 
rate of 214000 down 14 percent in the west to 210000 and down 
1 percent in the midwest to 101000

an effort by the army and the italian gunmaker 
beretta to correct a fault in the militarys new 9mm pistol has 
taken twice as long as expected and deliveries of the handgun wont 
resume until may service officials say 
we have a design approved but the production didnt get up 
and running as quickly as we had hoped says lt col john reitz 
an army spokesman at the pentagon 
we dont expect deliveries with the new design to begin until 
may reitz said in a recent interview 
in the meantime the army has decided to reduce by twothirds 
the number of times gun already in use may be fired before 
replacing the chamber slide mechanism the defective part 
noting an accident earlier this year in which a chamber slide 
shattered the army reduced from 3000 to 1000 the number of 
firings allowed before the slide was replaced 
the change is expected to have little effect for the time being 
because most personnel fire the pistol fewer than 100 times per 
year the spokesman said 
beretta usa which operates a manufacturing plant in accokeek 
md beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide 
9mm guns to replace the militarys venerable colt 45 the army 
which has designated the 9mm pistol the m9 is serving as the 
executive buying agent for all the services and awarded beretta an 
initial contract worth 75 million for 315000 pistols 
beretta usa is a subsidiary of the italian arms maker armi 
beretta spa and has so far delivered more than 140000 pistols it 
agreed last august to suspend deliveries starting in september 
until it corrected the problem of cracking slides 
at the time company and army officials announced that the 
gunmaker had agreed to change the way it made the metal slides by 
forging them with an improved heat process to ensure their 
strength the company also agreed to fit each gun including those 
already produced with a pin device to capture any slide that did 
crack 
the pin device would keep the slide or fragments from being 
thrown back into the shooters chest or face in the event of a 
failure 
when that agreement was hammered out last summer beretta and 
army officials said deliveries of the improved gun would begin in 
january 
its just taken longer than we thought reitz said 
reitz said the production delay was not having much of an impact 
on the services because the troops still have their older 
weapons theres no shortage 
ralph cole a spokesman for beretta usa said wednesday the 
company planned to begin delivering in april new slides and safety 
pin devices for guns already in use he agreed with reitz that 
deliveries of complete pistols would not resume until may but 
declined to detail the reasons for the additional delay 
the january accident was the fifth in which a chamber slide on a 
beretta cracked sending fragments toward the shooter in this 
case reitz said the incident left a marine only slightly injured 
but prompted the army to establish the new safety standard for gun 
useage 
the slide bolt on the beretta is thrown backward after a shot is 
fired as part of the process of loading a new round into the guns 
chamber 
in a related development the army spokesman said the navys 
seal commando forces had backtracked and decided not to switch 
to the beretta 9mm in part because of concern over the slide 
failures 
the army agreed with that decision because of the special 
circumstances that apply reitz said 
first of all their level of usage is just incredible as much 
as 30000 rounds a year and theyre dragging the guns in and out 
of the water so the navy decided to look at other pistols and the 
army is going to do the same when it comes to our special 
operations forces

the united states threatened with the 
collapse of international trade talks has accepted a compromise on 
its controversial proposal to eliminate farm subsidies agriculture 
officials said wednesday 
the us compromise may help break a stalemate with the european 
economic community that has derailed talks among 100 nations on 
liberalizing trade in everything from corn to computer chips 
the controversy centers around the 12nation eecs rejection of 
a us demand for elimination of farm supports which the united 
states contends distort international trade the sides were unable 
to reach a compromise at a meeting of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade in montreal last december and postponed further 
negotiations until april 5 in geneva 
other members of gatt which regulates international commerce 
have refused to take any action on other pressing trade problems 
until the two economic giants settle their agriculture clash 
the united states has agreed to european language that would 
call for a progressive substantial reduction of support for 
farmers but not total elimination said agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
another agriculture department official speaking on condition 
he not be identified said the eec had indicated to us 
negotiators that it would accept the compromise language proposed 
by the swiss chairman of the gatt arthur dunkel 
what we have tried to do is state it in a manner that might be 
a little more palatable politically to our european counterparts 
yeutter said in an interview on national public radio 
yeutter who represented the united states at the montreal talks 
in his previous capacity as trade representative denied the new 
formulation constituted a compromise for the united states 
as i indicated it may be slightly more palatable in western 
europe and if so were glad to have it be accepted on that 
basis yeutter said but that formulation will get us to the 
ultimate objective of getting rid of the tradedistorting kind of 
practices in agriculture around the world he said 
the eec facing concerted pressure from a larger and more 
powerful farm lobby than the united states has contends it too 
would like to reduce agricultural subsidies but it cannot accept a 
us demand for their total elimination 
the united states says that as long as the europeans support 
their farmers it too must prop up american farmers so they can 
compete on world markets us supports which go mostly for 
production reached about 26 million in 1987 and dropped slightly 
last year because of the drought 
the us position on farm supports has been gradually eroding 
since last year when former president reagan dropped his original 
goal for the worldwide elimination of farm subsidies by the year 
2000 
the united states then took the position that it was not setting 
any date for elimination of the supports but was seeking instead a 
commitment from all gatt members for eventual elimination 
in the absence of such a commitment the united states intends 
to press the eec at the geneva meeting to reduce its export subsidy 
for farmers yeutter said the united states has had to keep up with 
the europeans by increasing export supports for farmers and its 
really sheer economic madness 
another potential sticking point in geneva is a new eec demand 
that the united states freeze current limitations on the size of 
farm lands used for production the united states asked farmers to 
idle some lands last year because of the drought 
yeutter said he would reject the eec demand 
the european community is trying to lock us into that position 
forever and we just cant afford to have that take place he said 
agriculture department officials say they will decide by june 1 
whether to maintain the existing limitations on farm production 
depending on their determination of the past winters drought 
damage

reached the consulate on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office 
building apparently after taking a commercial flight from durban 
we have been in touch with the south african government with a 
view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible 
said gene friedman a us embassy spokesman 
ntombela 27 was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital 
since september he fled as the government announced plans to 
prevent future breakouts by moving hunger strikers to bloemfontein 
a relatively remote provincial capital 
three detainees who escaped in september holed up in the us 
consulate in johannesburg for five weeks and four detainees 
escaped to the west german embassy in pretoria this month all 
seven were allowed to go free 
ntombela detained since september was hospitalized in early 
march for treatment of depression and began a hunger strike march 
13 his lawyers said 
foreign minister pik botha said police were studying ntombelas 
case and a decision would be made later as to whether he could go 
free 
botha said the five men and one woman who entered the british 
embassy at midday wednesday would not be arrested if they left 
even though some had violated their restrictions 
the british embassy said the group cannot stay indefinitely on 
british government premises and should leave 
one of the six was donsie khumalo an official of the congress 
of south african trade unions the main black labor federation he 
was released last week after staging a hunger strike to protest 
being held without charge 
the detainees are held under a state of emergency declared in 
june 1986 to quell antiapartheid unrest in black townships 
like many other freed activists khumalo 39 is barred from 
various political activities required to report to a police 
station twice daily and confined to his house at night 
colleagues of the six said they sought to encourage britain to 
pressure south african authorities to lift restrictions on all 
former detainees 
their move coincided with a visit to neighboring zimbabwe by 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who has been urging 
negotiations to resolve south africas racial conflict 
brig leon mellet a spokesman for law and order minister 
adriaan vlok said detainees who stage hunger strikes in the future 
will be placed in grootvlei prison in bloemfontein and if they 
require hospitalization will be sent to a nearby hospital 
bloemfontein in central south africa is far from other cities 
detainees held there would have more difficulty escaping and 
publicity about the hunger strike campaign might be reduced

president najib asked the united 
nations on wednesday to establish checkpoints along the 
afghanpakistani border to prevent arms and troops from reaching 
moslem guerrillas a spokesman said 
najib made the request in a letter sent to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said foreign ministry 
spokesman mohammad nabi amani 
amani also said guerrillas aided by pakistani troops continued 
rocket and artillery fire in and around the city of jalalabad 
where guerrillas have surrounded government forces since march 6 
amani said the 11th and 18th divisions of pakistans army were 
inside afghanistan in the last 24 hours they had fired longrange 
weapons at afghan government forces 
kabul says the pakistanis are sending a steady stream of troops 
and weapons to help the guerrillas who have been fighting the 
sovietbacked government for nine years 
pakistan like the united states supports the guerrillas but 
denies having troops in afghanistan 
neither the border post proposal nor the accusation against 
pakistan is new but the allegations have increased in vehemence 
and frequency since feb 15 when the last soviet soldiers who had 
been backing najibs troops left the country 
amani said there was no doubt the government was dominant in 
the fight for jalalabad 75 miles east of kabul he claimed that in 
the 24hour period ending wednesday evening government forces 
killed 137 opposition fighters and injured 56 afghan army troops 
suffered no casualties he said 
amani said five civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in 
jalalabad 
the soviet unions official tass news agency said in a dispatch 
from kabul that the cities of herat ghazni and khost also came 
under heavy artillery fire from opposition forces and that four 
children in tose cities were killed 
the figures could not be verified 
jalalabad is the guerrillas first offensive since the soviet 
pullout and would be the biggest city they have captured if it 
falls it would be a major blow to the morale of the government and 
a big boost to the rebels 
the government has not provided a death toll from the jalalabad 
fighting but reports issued since it began add up to more than 
2600 with about 90 percent said to be guerrillas the guerrillas 
give far lower numbers 
in the letter to perez de cuellar najib said the un good 
offices mission to afghanistan and pakistan established to monitor 
the departure of soviet troops from afghanistan should take up 
duty on the border 
amani said the proposal was urgent because the missions mandate 
expires nov 15 
the force of 40 unarmed men from 10 nations does not have a 
mandate as a peacekeeping force its job since the soviet pullout 
has been to take complaints from kabul and islamabad about alleged 
violations by the other side 
the soviet withdrawal was brought about by a unsponsored 
agreement signed in geneva in april as part of the accord 
afghanistan and pakistan agreed not to interfere in each others 
internal affairs

gata kamsky the 14yearold soviet chess 
prodigy viewed as a possible future world champion defected from 
his native land for the freedom to make choices about his chess 
career and his future another soviet defector said wednesday 
kamsky and his father rustam kamsky were at federal 
immigration service offices in manhattan going through the 
paperwork to gain asylum said lev alburt a chess grandmaster who 
defected from the soviet union 10 years ago and since has won the 
us championship 
alburt disclosed tuesday that kamsky and his father asked for 
asylum at the end of play tuesday in the new york open chess 
tournament at the penta hotel 
he said the kamskys were taken in tow by allen kaufman 
executive director of the american chess foundation and two fbi 
agents one of whom was fluent in russian neither of the kamskys 
speaks english 
spokesmen for the fbi and the us immigration and 
naturalization service have not confirmed the defection citing a 
policy of saying nothing about asylum cases for the protection of 
the defectors 
the soviet un ambassador alexander m belonogov had no 
comment 
alburt 43 said he had spoken to the kamskys before they asked 
for asylum 
the bottom line for virtually all defection is the people 
dont want to stay in the huge prison that any communist country 
is he said they want to be free but in each case it may be a 
different kind of freedom 
in their case it was freedom to travel to chess tournaments 
freedom to choose college and so on 
young kamsky a twotime soviet national junior champion was 
heralded as a whiz kid last summer in a dispatch by tass the 
official soviet news agency 
it described him as reading and writing at age 2 and being 
placed in the fourth grade when he started school it said the 
father is a photographer and also coaches his son

the communist party newspaper pravda said 
wednesday that soviet voters struck a blow for reform in 
legislative elections which many official candidates lost and 
three dates were announced for runoff contests 
the newspaper said sundays election the first in 70 years to 
give voters a choice was a vote for the new policies of president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
voters did not simply vote like it was earlier but they 
really made a choice giving their preference to candidates whose 
preelection platforms suited them better pravda said 
choosing peoples deputies the country voted for perestroika 
the official news agency tass said candidates in 275 districts 
failed to win the majority needed for a seat in the new 
2250member congress of peoples deputies 
elections will be held may 14 in 199 electoral districts in 
which neither of the two candidates running for parliament seats 
won the majority it said 
in 76 districts with three or more candidates none of whom got 
a majority runoffs will be held april 2 and april 9 between the 
top two candidates in each race the agency said 
sundays vote was for 1500 of the parliament seats the other 
750 were filled by the party and official institutions without 
elections 
official results will not be released for several days but the 
news reports wednesday added details about the rejection of party 
and government officials 
those in the three largest cities moscow leningrad and kiev 
felt the sting of a frustrated public as did at least 37 top local 
officials around the country 
among the losers was yuri solovyev a 59yearold candidate 
member of the ruling politburo who ran unopposed in leningrad but 
was kept from a majority by voters who crossed his name off the 
ballot 
tass gave the first detailed report wednesday on solovyevs 
failure and said 11 other government candidates also lost in 21 
races it said solovyev got 44 percent of the vote 
leningrad mayor vladimir khodyrev told tass his citys 
candidates lost because the public was poorly informed about their 
activity and voted on the basis of rumors and gossip 
the poor fortune of official candidates could help gorbachev by 
emphasizing public frustration over the leadership and the slow 
progress of reform 
reports from byelorussia and armenia where citizen demands for 
reform have created problems for the party establishment indicated 
the voters either rejected top official candidates or did not vote 
pravda said the losers included v galko city party leader in 
minsk the byelorussian capital and a first deputy premier of the 
republic y khusainov voters also rejected party leaders in the 
southern gomel and mogilev regions which were affected by the 1986 
chernobyl nuclear disaster in the neighboring ukraine 
many citizens of minsk were angered last fall by tough police 
action against a new peoples front grassroots organization and 
groups seeking to build a memorial to victims of stalins purges 
in armenia voters stayed home to express frustration over a 
lack of choice the government newspaper izvestia reported 
at the very climax of the campaign people asked a question 
for which they did not receive a convincing answer the newspaper 
said 
why did a group of leaders of the republic nominated as 
candidates have no opponents it said and added many as a 
sign of protest refused to take part in elections without a 
choice 
in many parts of the soviet union 85 percent to 95 percent of 
voters participated but in armenia the figure was 719 only 53 
percent voted in yerevan capital of the republic 
pravda said losers in the soviet far east included the party 
leaders in khabarovsk region and the birobidzhan jewish autonomous 
region the regional party leader in chita siberia and the leader 
in the tuymen oilproducing region of northwestern siberia

a legislator wednesday introduced a bill that 
would make it illegal for police to impersonate journalists while 
entering arab villages to make arrests 
the proposal comes amid a dispute between reporters and the 
police after two reported instances last week in which plainclothes 
policemen were seen with press or tv signs in the windows 
of their unmarked cars 
reporters usually put the signs in the windows to prevent 
protesters from throwing rocks or firebombs on their vehicles while 
covering the palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
parliamentarian avraham poraz a member of the liberal shinui 
party who proposed the bill said the policemens camouflage 
practice could harm freedom of the press in israel curtailing the 
usually outspoken media 
its important for journalists to be everywhere and have 
access to information he said 
people come to journalists and tell them all kinds of things 
if they start thinking the journalist is really a policeman they 
wont talk and that could damage freedom of the press poraz 
said 
after last weeks incidents involving police masquerading as 
reporters police inspectorgeneral krauss said the practice was 
legal and would continue 
but when israeli journalists and foreign correspondents 
protested he agreed to limit the practice requiring his personal 
permission for using the tactic 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post criticized krauss position 
in an editorial wednesday 
what the police inspectorgeneral has sanctioned in 
principle is the delegitimization of the press in its role as 
observer of the palestinian uprising the newspaper said that 
this should be allowed in a democratic society is inconceivable 
roni shaked head of a committee of journalists who cover the 
territories also argued the police practice endangers reporters 
the security forces and police defend themselves with weapons 
and steel helmets and we have only our pens and the press 
signs he said 
palestinian youths regularly stone cars with yellow israeli 
license plates but they sometimes spare cars with press signs 
reporters frequently have complained that israeli security 
agents and police masqueraded as journalists to move about the 
occupied territories and make arrests 
authorities have denied the tactic was used but the issue came 
to a head last week when a british tv crew filmed the two police 
with the tv sign on their car then watched them arrest a 
teenage palestinian girl 
the idea also has apparently caught on among followers of the 
antiarab former legislator rabbi meir kahane who placed a 
press sign in the window of their van according to a 
photograph in the yediot ahronot newspaper 
in introducing his bill poraz noted that while impersonating 
doctors or lawyers is illegal no such protection exists for 
journalists his bill makes an exception for national security 
cases but even then a courts permission would be required

a 31story highrise that sparked a threeyear 
fight between activists and a developer must have its top 12 floors 
razed to comply with local law a city agency has ruled 
the board of standards and appeals unanimously rejected 
arguments by parkview associates that its upper east side building 
receive a variance allowing it to override zoning laws 
parkviews attorney jay segal said wednesday the firm would 
not decide for at least a week whether to appeal tuesdays decision 
in the state supreme court the firm has 30 days in which to 
appeal supreme court is new york states triallevel court 
parkview which has said it stands to lose 10 million by 
dismantling the foughtover floors had taken the fight to the us 
supreme court last year to avoid lopping off the 12 stories it had 
topped off in 1986 
activists who began the fight against the building hailed the 
decision as a warning to developers in manhattan 
this is a very strong message zoning is not for sale no more 
indulging developers said genie rice president of the 
neighborhood group civitas you cant decide to go ahead with a 
project and then buy your way out 
parkview had continued work on the building for two months in 
the summer of 1986 while its permit was reviewed 
the builder had offered to build about 40 lowincome senior 
citizen apartments in east harlem in return for a zoning variance 
leaving the building intact 
the fight over the building began when ms rice discovered the 
building had been constructed in violation of local zoning laws 
setting the limit for new buildings at 19 stories 
parkview associates bought the site in 1982 and received a 
construction permit for 31 stories in 1985 when city officials 
misinterpreted a zoning map 
when the case went into the courts the new york state court of 
appeals ruled the original permit was invalid and that the building 
owner must share in the blame reasonable diligence by parkview 
would have discovered the correct zoning the court ruled 
the us supreme court without comment left that ruling intact 
if parkview is unable to overturn the boards ruling the 
process for dismantling the extra floors would be the same used for 
tearing down old buildings 
protective scaffolding is placed outside the building with 
workers going from the top down prying off the brick facing 
breaking the concrete floor into movable chunks and torching 
through metalwork

after congress resoundingly rejected a 51 
percent pay raise last month house speaker jim wright was asked if 
the issue would surface again 
i hope not real soon he said i can count 
seven weeks later wright and his colleagues are being asked to 
count again most seem unwilling to do that 
will something get done this year i doubt it house 
majority whip tony coelho dcalif said wednesday something 
needs to be done but im not at all optimistic and next year is an 
election year its even worse 
coelho the democrats chief vote counter was reacting to a new 
raise proposal by a commission that studied the salaries of members 
of congress federal judges and senior government executives 
president bush welcomed the recommendations and said he would soon 
offer specific proposals to the congress 
the commission headed by former federal reserve chairman paul 
volcker proposed raises of approximately 50 percent over two 
years not much different than the package killed last month after 
a firestorm of citizen opposition 
rankandfile members of congress now are paid 89500 a year a 
50 percent raise would boost congressional salaries to 135000 
capitol hills initial reaction could best be summed up as 
thanks but no thanks 
hardly a surprise given the events of late january and early 
february following a proposal that congressional salaries be 
raised by 51 percent 
opponents notably radio talk show hosts took little note of 
the fact that the package also covered judges and managers of many 
of the governments most important and sensitive programs the 
nations anger was directed at congress 
the talk show hosts and their callers portrayed the lawmakers as 
greedy donothings angry constituents flooded the capitol mail 
room with letters and tea bags to protest polls showed 
overwhelming public opposition to the raises which were due to 
take effect automatically 
facing all that wright decided the pay plan should go to a 
vote the outcome was as inevitable as death and taxes 
afterward wright said it was time to move on bush seemed to 
concur 
what you dont want to do is come in and when the wounded are 
still lying on the battlefield start fighting another battle he 
said then 
bush apparently believes now that the wounds have already healed 
coelho said bushs leadership is vital to any hopes of passing 
pay raises for members of congress federal judges and government 
executives but he quickly added that the president would have to 
get republicans in line before the democratic leadership would 
embrace a new pay plan 
everybody does their own thing around here instead of doing 
what is in the best interests of the institution coelho said 
you can get a lot of mileage out of opposing pay hikes if youre 
thinking about running for the senate from iowa 
that was a shot at rep thomas tauke riowa a leading opponent 
of the pay raises voted down last month 
coelho didnt say it but hopes of winning a pay raise could 
rest on getting ralph nader in line too 
nader led the talk show assault on the last pay raise package 
and was quick to criticize the new one 
president bush should apply his flexible freeze philosophy to 
the salaries of top government officials the selfstyled 
consumer advocate said 
coelho asked if any new attempt at pay raises would likely meet 
the same fate as the last replied 
sure the ralph naders and the talk show hosts will prevail 
its not that a majority of the lawmakers dont think they 
deserve a hefty raise 
rep dan rostenkowski dill drew a standing ovation last 
month when he insisted each member of the house democrat and 
republican is worth 135000 
the question now is whether enough of the lawmakers think its 
worth trying again to convince the american public of that 
coelho doubts it 
i count the votes and i dont count enough of them on either 
side of the aisle he said we have a tendency to shoot 
ourselves in the foot we certainly have on this one

officials worked around the clock wednesday to 
restore contact with a space probe circling the martian moon 
phobos but hopes were fading that they could save the 500 million 
project 
a commission has been formed to determine the cause of the 
failure of phobos ii and present its conclusions in a week said 
sergei zavgorodny an official at glavkosmos the soviet space 
agency 
in an interview with the newspaper izvestia glavkosmos head 
alexander dunayev said scientists were awaiting the commissions 
findings before taking further action 
scientists at moscows space research institute which developed 
the project to explore mars and phobos its biggest moon met 
throughout the day wednesday 
one expert emerged and gave a gloomy assessment of the future of 
the spacecraft whose companion probe phobos i became lost in space 
in september after a ground controller sent an erroneous computer 
command 
the situation is bad and honestly there are fewer and fewer 
hopes chances to regain contact with the probe are very small 
said alexander zakharov a project scientist 
a soviet tv commentator suggested that western news reports 
claiming the problem was catastrophic were exagerrated and 
cited successful studies by the craft of solar radiation and the 
surface of mars itself conducted before the communication failure 
the report on the evening news program vremya featured 
detailed maps of the martian surface compiled photos taken by the 
spacecraft 
ground control has received sporadic radio signals from the 
spacecraft an unmanned spacecraft launched in july but no regular 
contact he said 
izvestia said the problem occurred monday when ground 
controllers were trying to reorient the spacecraft to take 
photographs of the martian moon after the maneuver it said 
controllers were unable to contact the craft despite repeated 
attempts 
dunayev said there were seven or eight possibilities as to why 
communications failed he did not elaborate and efforts to reach 
him were unsuccessful 
loss of phobos ii would be a severe setback for the 480 million 
international phobos project led by the soviet union twentytwo 
countries and the european space agency have contributed technology 
or experiments to the project and the united states was helping 
track the two craft with nasas deep space network 
loss of communications apparently would prevent phobos ii from 
dropping two small landing craft onto the surface of the martian 
moon soviet news reports in january said the spacecraft was to 
approach the moon next month to analyze its soil with a laser and 
then release two landers 
roger bonnet science director of the parisbased european space 
agency said there is some hope of regaining contact with 
phobos ii its not zero he added in an interview 
its a disappointment but the mars phase was a great success 
we obtained unique information on the surface of mars its 
atmosphere its magnetic field and its environment bonnet said 
in washington nasa spokesman jeff vincent said the soviets had 
not asked the united states for help but that the agencys tracking 
network is monitoring the craft there is nothing we can do for 
them he said 
tass announced jan 30 that phobos ii went into orbit around 
mars the previous day after a sixmonth 111 millionmile voyage 
from earth and was studying the planets climate and soil 
soviet space officials have said the mission would help them 
prepare a manned mission to mars early in the 21st century 
phobos ii was launched july 12 in a program to unlock mysteries 
of the red planet and phobos tass said in december tass said 
some instruments aboard phobos ii failed but most were fixed and 
the problems would not prevent the completion of its program 
phobos i was lost only three months after it was launched july 
7 and ground controllers have been unable to communicate with it

two police officers were buried in 
kosovo province on wednesday in ceremonies that illustrated the 
stark ethnic differences that divide the people of the troubled 
region 
in one village an ethnic albanian police officer was laid to 
rest in an unmarked grave after a procession where the only women 
allowed to be present were the victims mother wife and daughter 
in another village a serbian officer was buried by a priest 
following a church service attended by thousands of men and women 
the only things the services shared were a deep sense of 
mourning and a large police detail that frisked those attending for 
concealed weapons 
perhaps the killing of an ethnic albanian and a serb will 
serve to sober nationalist passions that have erupted in our 
land said a policeman guarding one of the funerals he refused 
to give his name 
officer jetulah kuchi an ethnic albanian and officer miroljub 
tanaskovic a serb both died of gunshot wounds suffered during 
clashes earlier this week between ethnic albanians and police 
kuchi 31 a father of four and the commander of the police 
station in podujevo was buried in suva reka village in a moslem 
funeral 
most of the 200 mourners were ethnic albanian men wearing 
traditional domeshaped white hats and filing past his photograph 
moments before the coffin was lowered into an unmarked grave in 
keeping with moslem customs 
his mother wife and daughters were the only females allowed to 
accompany the coffin while other women relatives remained at home 
weeping loudly 
albanian men and boys lined the narrow winding unpaved streets 
leading to the moslem cemetery in suva reka 40 miles south of 
pristina as policemen carried the coffin on its last journey 
patrolman tanaskovic was laid to rest hours later in a different 
cemetery in accordance with the rites of the serbian orthodox 
church 
at least 5000 serbian men and women gathered around the 
yellowandorange striped orthodox church in preoce six miles 
south of pristina to pay their last respects to tanaskovic 
the 34yearold patrolman married with one child reportedly 
died when a sniper shot him in the town of titova mitrovica a 
bearded orthodox priest conducted part of the burial ceremony 
people attending both funerals were frisked in suva reka at 
least five sovietbuilt t55 stood guard to prevent further 
demonstrations 
at least 23 people were killed this week in clashes in kosovo 
province after the legislature in kosovo which is part of serbia 
approved constitutional changes giving serbia more control over the 
province 
serbs said the changes were needed to protect them from 
persecution at the hands of the ethnic albanians who are in the 
majority ethnic albanians said the changes robbed them of autonomy 
they won in a 1974 constitution

syrian forces blasted lebanons christian 
enclave with rocket fire wednesday ignoring a ceasefire called by 
the army commander the main christian militia threatened to strike 
back with double cruelty 
we are adhering to the truce despite the random syrian 
shelling that has targeted even hospitals the army commander 
gen michel aoun told a news conference but our patience has 
limits 
aoun said the syrian leadership was acting in a terrorist 
way and he said he would complain to the un security council 
and the arab league 
salvos fired from multibarreled rocket launchers thundered over 
the lebanese capital all day despite the truce aoun proclaimed at 
midnight in response to an arab league appeal the shelling 
intensified at nightfall 
we warn the aggressors who are entrenched inside residential 
districts against this massive escalation said the lebanese 
forces the christians main militia if it continues we will be 
compelled to retaliate with double cruelty to stop these criminal 
practices 
police said two people were killed and 16 others were wounded in 
the syrian bombardment of east beirut since the fighting began 
march 8 123 people have died and 388 have been injured 
the us embassy said ambassador john mccarthys residence in 
the christian suburb of yarze was struck by a syrian shell tuesday 
night damaging the living quarters but causing no casualties 
an embassy spokeswoman said mccarthy was in the bomb shelter at 
the time 
col joseph shidiak who commands a police unit protecting 
diplomats said the belgian and turkish embassies near the 
presidential palace in suburban baabda and the residence of british 
ambassador alann ramsay in rabieh also were hit by syrian rockets 
this week no casualties were reported 
a communique by aouns headquarters said the latest bombardment 
caught residents of east beirut as they were emerging from shelters 
to buy food and take stock of the damage from six straight nights 
of attacks 
militiamen in shweifat just south of beirut from where syrians 
and allied druse fighters have been firing into the christian 
heartland appeared disgruntled 
we do not like to kill our lebanese brethren said a fighter 
with druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
who identified himself only as abu antar 
we dont like this dirty war civilians are dying on both 
sides he said the fighting can last for as long as we and 
they have ammunition 
police said at least 250000 people have fled west and south 
beirut in recent days 
the shelling has damaged power plants leaving some areas in 
total darkness and others with only a few hours of electricity a 
day 
the fighting began after aoun clamped a blockade on illegal 
ports operated by moslem militias these facilities have been 
depriving the government of an estimated 100 million a year in tax 
revenues 
syria keeps about 40000 troops in northern and eastern 
provinces as well as moslem west beirut under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to end the 14yearold civil war 
christian leaders say syria can no longer play the role of a 
neutral peacekeeper because of its bias toward moslems 
the moslemchristian rift deepened six months ago when president 
amin gemayels sixyear term expired and parliament was unable to 
elect a successor 
before he stepped down on sept22 gemayel named aoun head of an 
interim military cabinet 
moslems and syria rejected the appointment

democrats rejoiced wednesday over jill longs 
surprise victory in a normally republican congressional district in 
indiana while both political parties turned their attention to 
elections next month in alabama and wyoming 
neither democrats nor republicans claimed any important national 
trend in tuesdays returns from indiana in which long defeated 
republican dan heath by about 1700 votes to capture the house seat 
once held by vice president dan quayle 
but republican party chairman lee atwater said he was 
ashamed at the loss of the seat that had been a safe one for 
the gop and conceded that the race looked very tough next week 
in a heavily democratic region of alabama other republicans 
insisted their candidate was an underdog in the wyoming race even 
though the seat has been in gop hands for a decade 
democratic spokesman mike mccurry said his side holds the upper 
hand going into the final week of the alabama campaign he said if 
atwater is ashamed of the outcome of the indiana race hed be 
apoplectic if the democrats followed up with wins in alabama 
and wyoming 
in strict numerical terms the outcome of the three races will 
make scant difference in the house where the democratic majority 
will stand at 259174 when long is sworn in next week 
but that didnt stop the party professionals from scrutinizing 
the indiana returns or vying for public relations advantage in the 
two elections to come 
its hard to read this as a referendum on george bush but on 
the other hand absent a strong national republican agenda these 
local candidates dont have much to stand on mccurry said 
obviously we regret the loss said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater he said that the race reflected a lot of local 
issues but i dont think we would read much more into it 
long who received congratulations from quayle in a telephone 
call told reporters the contest was just a race between two 
individuals in northeast indiana 
long a 36yearold business professor who had twice been 
defeated in congressional campaigns will take the house seat given 
up by republican dan coats who was appointed to the senate after 
quayle was elected vice president 
alabamas election next tuesday pits democrat glen browder 
against republican john rice to fill the seat vacated by the death 
of longtime democratic rep bill nichols 
the wyoming election april 26 is to choose between democrat john 
vinich and republican craig thomas to succeed dick cheney who 
resigned from congress when he was confirmed as defense secretary 
republicans have won five of the last six presidential 
elections but havent figured out how to translate national 
strength into state and local strength said mccurry spokesman 
at the dnc 
the gop used personal campaigning by quayle coats and barbara 
bush in an unsuccessful effort to hold the indiana seat and heath 
aired a television commercial featuring the president 
but several republicans said long was successful because she was 
better known to the voters ran an aggressive campaign and 
capitalized on key local issues particularly her complaints about 
a local tax increase 
the republican party is not going to regain control of 
congress by running against house speaker jim wright and 
injecting george bush into every race said mark helmke a 
republican consultant with longtime ties to indiana 
atwater said i have no excuses we should have won that race 
i am very surprised we lost it 
atwater added that we didnt have the best candidate we 
didnt run the best campaign and on some issues we got snookered 
john buckley spokesman at the republican congressional campaign 
committee said the result in indiana and the possiblity of a 
followup democratic triumph in alabama puts more visibility on 
wyoming he said his organization would spend the maximum allowed 
by law 104000 on the race there and claimed the underdogs 
role for thomas 
vinich narrowly lost a bid to defeat sen malcolm wallop in 
november and is better known to the voters he said 
as for alabama we have a very tough row to hoe and he 
noted that 70000 votes were cast in the democratic primary to pick 
a general election candidate and only about 18000 in the 
republican primary 
at the democratic congressional campaign committee rep beryl 
anthony of arkansas issued a statement recommending that 
republicans spend more time protecting their own seats than 
wasting time with their grandiose plans to target democrats they 
have no chance to win that was a reference to a recent 
declaration by republican campaign boss edward rollins that wright 
would be a major target of republican efforts in 1990

states may not deny unemployment benefits to 
people who refuse to work on their sabbath even if the refusal is 
not based on a religious sects doctrine the supreme court said 
wednesday 
the court ruled unanimously that illinois officials violated a 
peoria mans religious freedom when denying him unemployment 
benefits 
im thrilled said william frazee after learning of his 
legal victory i am thankful for the lords faithfulness 
in a series of previous decisions the justices had barred 
states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse 
certain work because of religious scruples 
but in all previous cases the workers refusal was based on the 
teachings of an established religious group such as the seventhday 
adventists or the jehovahs witnesses 
writing for the court wednesday justice byron r white said the 
courts previous rulings never suggested that people who refrain 
from work because of religious scruples are ineligible for 
unemployment benefits unless they belong to a religious group that 
forbids such work 
the ruling means for example that a methodist or roman 
catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing 
to work on sunday even though neither church bars work on the 
sabbath as part of its official doctrine 
frazee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits 
after turning down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would 
have required him to work on sunday 
frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of 
christianity is that nonemergency work on sundays is forbidden 
the illinois department of employment security ruled that 
frazees rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving 
unemployment benefits 
state officials while not questioning frazees sincerity said 
a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based on some 
tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church sect or 
denomination and not based merely on personal religious 
convictions 
frazee sued and illinois courts ruled against him but the 
supreme court said the state courts were wrong 
white rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for 
frazee would lead to americans seeking sundays off because they 
want to shop play sports or even watch football on television 
we are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away 
from sunday employ if william frazee succeeds in his claim white 
said 
ironically frazee now is employed with the state department of 
employment security 
he said he still opposes sunday work unless one is involved in 
an essential service 
if i were a doctor ambulance driver or the like i would have 
no qualms but those jobs preserve and protect life he said 
in other decisions the court 
ruled in an oklahoma case that state not federal courts have 
the initial authority to rule on a states efforts to tax bingo 
games and cigarette sales conducted by indians outside a 
reservation 
ordered a federal appeals court to restudy the case of 
convicted a georgia murderer who is seeking to overturn his death 
sentence for a 1974 killing

reminiscent of the mission impossible 
television series a major film company plans to testmarket a 
videocassette that will selfdestruct after the movie has been 
watched a et number of times 
mgmua home video has decided to test the disposable tapes 
this summer in an undisclosed city according to herb fischer vice 
president of sales and marketing 
the mission of the new videocassette should studios decide to 
accept it will be to encourage the production companies to sell 
video rental stores more copies of a movie for the same price they 
would pay for tapes with unlimited play that would make it easier 
for movie renters nationwide to find a hot new release at their 
video stores 
it saves you going back three times to get the same film 
said steve roberts president of the los angelesbased s roberts 
co 
the company is consulting on the project for rank video services 
america a manufacturing duplicating company based in torrance 
calif that licensed the patent to the new product 
although these tapes will not go up in smoke when the limited 
number of plays are completed they will erase themselves and 
cannot then be rerecorded said roberts 
it becomes inoperative as a normal cassette said bob 
pfannkuch chairman of rank video services america he said the 
technology for this type of videocassette has been around for three 
to five years 
however it will be the first testmarketing of this type of 
tape that could have a profound influence in the 8 billion 
videocassette industry the first title has not yet been selected 
introduction of the new tapes which will have green cases to 
distinguish them from the typical black cases could meet strong 
initial demand for popular movies said roberts 
he said retailers lose from 520 percent of their potential 
business because frustrated customers who cannot find their 
firstchoice movie leave without renting anything 
a retail outlet currently pays more than 60 for a movie title 
and cannot afford to stock it in depth however with the 
disposable tapes programmed at 20 plays that retailer could buy 
the same movie for about 30 he said 
the goal of this is not to replace the traditional black 
tapes said roberts who explained that retailers would still buy 
the permanent tapes but would also purchase the green disposable 
movies for depth of copy 
however the head of a nationwide organization of independent 
video retailers said the reported problem of overwhelming demand 
for popular movies has been overstated 
our consumer surveys show that customers are generally happy 
and that 60 to 70 percent of the time they get their tape said 
john power president of the nonprofit 2500member american 
video association based in chandler ariz 
the disposable tape in theory is being promoted in a way that 
could sound attractive to retailers power said wednesday but 
retailers are concerned that marketers could eventually decide to 
make all their videocassettes disposable something his 
organization would find intolerable power said 
the price of the disposable tapes will be set as they are passed 
along from studios to wholesalers and finally to retailers roberts 
said rental fees probably will not be affected but customers will 
have to be more cautious about rewinding 
the disposable tapes can be rewound up to 20 minutes into the 
movie without triggering the counter that marks the number of 
plays after that any rewinding would count as a play said 
roberts 
none of the principals involved would reveal any other specifics 
of the technology involved in the disposable tapes other than to 
explain that the movies would be preset to play a number of times 
ranging from 15 to 60

the bush administration has asked congress for 
a 11 billion supplemental appropriation for the veterans affairs 
department for the current fiscal year the department announced 
wednesday 
some of the money already had been announced by members of 
congress including a 303 million request for the departments 
medical care arm 
officials said last fall that the more than 10 billion 
allocated in the regular appropriation was not going to be enough 
to maintain care for veterans whose income is enough to put them at 
the end of the line for care in the 172 hospitals of the veterans 
system 
at the time the shortfall was estimated at 600 million to 1 
billion 
the department has been raiding supply and equipment accounts to 
pay salaries while the administration decided how much money to 
seek approval of the 303 million will end those bookkeeping 
raids the department said 
of the balance of the request 701 million is for increased 
pension and other benefit payments to meet the 41 percent increase 
mandated by congress effective dec 1 such a supplemental 
appropriation is an annual routine 
some 22 million of the increase would be allocated to 
readjustment programs and 130 million to loan guarantee programs 
secretary edward j derwinski said he expected swift 
approval of the request which would bring his departments 
spending this year to 292 billion

the state department acknowledged wednesday 
that it is encouraging leaders of the nicaraguan contras to return 
to their homeland and do battle with the leftist sandinista 
government in the political rather than military arena 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the bush 
administration supports the willingness of individual resistance 
leaders or the leadership as a whole to voluntarily return to 
nicaragua to participate in the political process 
she said it is important to test the nicaraguan governments 
intention to carry out its promises of democratization and 
called on the international community to lend its full 
support and protection to those who return by monitoring their 
treatment inside nicaragua 
a fivenation regional peace agreement calls for political 
reforms inside nicaragua leading to a free and open campaign and 
national elections in february 1990 and one of the seven contra 
political directors said he and three colleagues are likely to 
accept that challenge 
we need a unified candidacy to mount an effective opposition 
to the ruling leftist sandinista party said alfredo cesar a 
member of the nicaraguan resistance political directorate 
cesar said he would return to nicaragua in may if promised 
changes in election and communications law are accomplished and if 
the presidents of the five central american countries come up with 
a suitable plan for eventual repatriation of contra fighters 
he said he would not himself seek election but would work to 
bring together the many political parties in the splintered 
opposition behind a candidate who can bridge the broad spectrum of 
political beliefs in the country we need someone who is above 
politics he said but declined to name who might fit that 
description 
and he said based on private conversations with other members 
of the directorate three others in the contra political leadership 
also were likely to return and involve themselves in the campaign 
leading to national elections next february the other three 
probably will not go back he said 
the bush administration seeking to implement a new bipartisan 
policy approach to central america worked out with congress last 
week is pressing the rebel leaders to return to nicaragua and is 
cutting by at least half the money the united states now spends to 
support the rebels political activities in exile 
cesar said that means us support will drop from 400000 a 
month to about 200000 necessitating the laying off of employees 
and the possible closing of some offices 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed the new policy 
direction wednesday saying wed like to see the focus go now to 
the political and diplomatic affairs of nicaragua we would 
like to see the leadership integrated back into the political 
society there 
as a further step toward translating the new policy into action 
president bush will meet at the white house next week with costa 
rican president oscar arias the author of a regional peace accord 
said fitzwater 
arias who won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for his efforts 
will stop in washington en route to canada to discuss the status of 
the regional peace process and how the new administration policy 
fits in 
in addition bush plans to meet in the next few weeks with 
alfredo cristiani the presidentelect of el salvador who won 
election last week as the candidate of the rightist arena party 
fitzwater said 
under the new policy the contras are being urged to join the 
internal political opposition in their country and become 
contenders in next years elections 
even though its only at the suggestion level its a very 
strong suggestion cesar said in a telephone interview the 
message is that they will no longer support political activities in 
exile the only ones they will support are ones conducted inside 
nicaragua as part of the political opposition there 
cesar said that message was delivered to the rebels at a state 
department meeting when the seven members of the directorate were 
in washington two weeks ago it was repeated in stronger terms when 
a state department delegation traveled to miami to meet again with 
the group last friday at the same time bush was announcing a new 
policy toward nicaragua at the white house 
the whole idea behind that is that political activity should 
be transferred inside nicaragua which is where the testing arena 
is now said cesar 
the new policy arrived at after weeks of meetings with 
congressional leaders calls for a 10month renewal of humanitarian 
aid to the rebels troops now based in border camps just inside 
neighboring honduras 
but it also commits the united states to support a peace process 
undertaken by the five countries in the region and permits the 
rebel aid to be used to relocate the fighters into their homeland 
when political conditions there improve

president bush said wednesday that parents 
dont deserve a tax break for paying tuition to send their children 
to private schools cant afford to do that he said 
everybody should support the public school system and then if 
on top of that your parents think that they want to shell out in 
addition to the tax money tuition money thats their right 
bush told a student group but i dont think they should get a 
break for that 
he said it is the obligation of all taxpayers to support a 
public education system 
the reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax 
credits for parents who send their children to private schools but 
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system 
bush made his comments in a question and answer session with 75 
students spending a week in washington as part of a program to give 
youths an inside look at government the program is sponsored by 
close up a nonpartisan educational foundation 
joseph thill a student at the hawaii preparatory academy told 
bush that his parents pay his tuition but also have to pay taxes 
for public education and asked whether they should get a tax break 
no no they shouldnt bush replied 
bush said he wanted the public education system to be the 
best and i think in many ways it is the best although i am 
disturbed when i see some kids underachieving not being able to 
identify where the united states is on the globe or something of 
that nature 
he said he had been intrigued by the concept of tuition tax 
credits for private institutions including parochial schools 
however he said cant afford to do that because of the big 
budget deficit 
bush also said that the federal government should not be the 
final arbiter on educational matters insisting that role 
should be filled by states and local communities 
on another subject bush who has said he wants to wipe out 
illiteracy within eight years said i dont think the federal 
government can eliminate it he said it will require resources 
beyond government including help from corporations and others

the united states on wednesday welcomed a call 
by the arab league for a ceasefire in lebanon and urged all 
warring groups to comply 
we strongly support that call and we share the arab leagues 
concern about the grave situation in lebanon said a state 
department statement the shelling must stop and the land and sea 
blockades must end 
syrian gunners and their druse allies have been trading 
artillery fire with christian army units in beirut since march 8 in 
the worst sectarian fighting the country has known in four years 
the christians headed by gen michel aoun have blockaded 
southern ports used by moslem militias and the moslems have 
retaliated with a counterblockade of the christian enclave in the 
north 
the united states views the lifting of the blockades as vital to 
restoring some calm to beirut so the sides can negotiate a 
ceasefire 
all parties to the fighting must negotiate their differences 
with one another further civilian casualities and suffering must 
be avoided at all cost the statement said lebanese police 
say 122 people have been killed in the fighting and 376 injured 
the us statement reiterated us willingness to assist the 
arab leagues peace initiative however we can us officials 
say assistance would be in the form of using what influence the 
united states has to get the warring parties to talk to each other 
we cant do it for them said one official we can push 
them to get into the same room we can urge them but we cant 
solve their problem he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the united states is also consulting with other countries who 
wield some influence on syria and on the lebanese christians he

the rapid growth of us aquaculture that 
began a decade ago slowed in 1988 largely because of less 
expansion in the catfish industry the agriculture department said 
wednesday 
overall us production of edible and nonedible aquaculture 
products increased only 40 million pounds last year compared with 
a 1987 growth of more than 100 million pounds the departments 
economic research service said in a preliminary report 
slower growth in the catfish industry which accounts for 
about 45 percent of us aquaculture production was principally 
responsible for the less rapid total expansion the report said 
the slowdown in catfish was partly offset by stronger growth in 
some other aquaculture products such as salmon tilapia and striped 
bass 
despite the throttling back in catfish production total 1988 
output grew 52 percent to a record 295 millon pounds the report 
said catfish growth was more than 32 percent in 1987 and 11 
percent in 1986 
catfish production was accompanied by a 236 percent increase in 
prices paid farmers by processors in 1988 those price averages 
ranged from 161 per pound in california to 71 cents in louisiana 
however higher feed and energy costs led to a 20 percent to 
25 percent increase in production costs which meant that net 
returns to farmers were only 5 percent to 10 percent higher 
the report said 
trout producers surveyed by the agency sold 589 million pounds 
with a value of 636 million between sept 1 1987 and aug 31 
1988 the report said producers also sold more than 361 million 
trout eggs worth 28 million 
production of penraised salmon was estimated at six million 
pounds in 1988 a 70 percent increase from 1987 the report said 
domestic salmon production will probably continue to see large 
gains in the next few years 
imports of fish and shellfish products last year were estimated 
at 45 billion down from 54 billion in 1987 
this marks the first decline in the value of imported fishery 
products in six years the report said at the same time us 
exports of fishery products have increased from 15 billion to 2 
billion 
the higher export value resulted from the decline in the value 
of the us dollar overseas making us products less expensive in 
foreign markets the report said

the world bank is planning to spend 186 
million on rebuilding its headquarters a spokesman said wednesday 
william brannigan of the banks information staff said he hopes 
work can start by the end of this year to remodel the headquarters 
one of the four buildings to be replaced dates back to 1941 
the banks main entrance faces the main building of its sister 
organization the international monetary fund they are just below 
pennsylvania avenue on 19th street three blocks west of the white 
house 
the bank plans eventually to put 1900 permanent employees to 
its new buildings from offices it now rents elsewhere in 
washington in addition to the 3000 workers in the old ones 
when the sixyear project is completed it will save 30 million 
a year on rent brannigan added he eplained the job will be done 
slowly to disrupt the banks work as little as possible 
the new headquarters will have 15 million square feet a 
competition is being held for the design 
the bank is owned by governments with nearly 20 percent of the 
shares held by the united states it is the biggest source of 
lending to third world countries and approved more than 19 billion 
in loans last year the bank turns a profit by borrowing money on 
world markets and putting it out at higher rates of return both 
from borrowing governments and from business investments

a courtappointed physician will reexamine 
former philippine president ferdinand marcos because the results of 
his first physical could be outdated a prosecutor said wednesday 
this is just to confirm the reports of his health and to 
update our own information because the other exam was so long 
ago said assistant us attorney charles labella the lead 
prosecutor in the governments criminal racketeering case against 
the ousted leader 
marcos 71 has been hospitalized at st francis medical center 
here since jan 15 for treatment of respiratory and heart ailments 
he remained in guarded condition wednesday in the hospitals 
intensive care unit 
marcos and his wife imelda are accused of stealing more than 
100 million from their homeland and stashing much of it in the 
united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on 5 
million bail but marcos ill health has prevented his arraignment 
his attorneys say he is too sick to ever stand trial and have asked 
us district judge john keenan of new york for marcos conditional 
removal from the case meaning he would only be prosecuted if he 
recovers 
keenan has yet to rule on that request 
courtappointed physician francis weld of new yorks columbia 
presbyterian medical center examined marcos in october found him 
fit to stand trial weld said marcos appeared to be faking some 
symptoms and that he could not account for some of the pain marcos 
claimed to be suffering 
since then marcos has suffered several bouts of congestive 
heart failure a lung collapse and other respiratory ailments he 
was hospitalized briefly twice before his latest hospitalization 
which began jan 15 
last month lung specialist dr george druger said marcos had a 
50 percent chance of ever leaving the hospital and a 10 percent 
chance of living another year 
labella said weld would probably reexamine marcos in honolulu 
on april 1 although defense attorney john bartko said the date had 
not been agreed upon

a research and lobbying group opposed to 
abortion asked bush administration officials on wednesday to 
investigate the use of abortion as a means of choosing the sex of a 
baby 
the family research council cited news reports as showing a 
significant trend toward sexselection abortions and said the 
evidence suggests that it is overwhelmingly female fetuses that 
are being aborted 
the group sent letters to attorney general richard thornburgh 
and health and human services secretary louis sullivan asking that 
the practice be investigated as a possible violation of civil 
rights 
for unborn female babies to be aborted solely because they are 
female is a grotesque form of discrimination that should not be 
permitted in a society committed to equal rights said the letter 
signed by gary l bauer who joined the council as president last 
year after serving as president reagans domestic policy adviser 
he said that at the least the government should cut off federal 
funding of any medical facility allowing abortions on the basis of 
sex 
our society should not tolerate discriminatory medical 
practices aimed at minorities or women in any of those 
institutions clearly abortions based on the sex of the child is a 
fatal form of discrimination he said 
the sex of a fetus can be determined through amniocentesis or a 
newer test called chorionic villus sampling or cvs which can make 
the determination earlier than amniocentesis

an unusual chemical composition found in 
halleys comet suggests that a star may have exploded near the sun 
during the formation of the solar system some 46 billion years 
ago according arizona state university astronomers 
susan wyckoff arizona state professor of physics and astronomy 
said wednesday that a spectrum analysis of elements in halleys 
comet shows that its ratio of carbon isotopes is unlike any tested 
elsewhere in the solar system 
this suggests she said a supernova exploded near the sun and 
contaminated the gas cloud that later condensed to form the planets 
and other objects orbiting near the sun 
if this hypothesis is correct it means that when the sun 
formed it didnt form as an isolated star said wychkoff like 
many other stars we know in the galaxy the sun may have formed in 
a group or cluster of stars 
one or more of the other stars in the cluster could have become 
a supernova in such stellar explosions she said new chemical 
elements are formed and ejected if this occurred near enough to 
contaminate the cloud from which the earth and other parts of the 
solar system formed then traces of those chemical isotopes would 
be found on those bodies 
halleys comet would have escaped this supernova contamination 
because it is believed to have formed in a region called the kuiper 
belt which is about 100 times farther from the sun than pluto the 
outermost of the planets 
wyckoff said the possibility of a supernova around the time of 
the solar system formation is speculation based on the difference 
in the ratios of the isotopes carbon 12 and carbon 13 the ratio is 
89 parts of carbon 12 to one part carbon 13 in earth and lunar 
samples in meteorites and in the atmospheres of the planets 
jupiter and saturn 
however the carbon ratio in haleys comet was found to be only 
65to1 she said 
the most logical explanation for this difference said wyckoff 
is that the sun had a companion star that exploded she cautioned 
however that more sampling is needed to confirm this speculation 
the 65 is found only in halleys comet but it is the only 
comet that has been looked at said wyckoff the 89 ratio is 
found in virtually every other object that has been looked at 
the astronomer said these ratio differences could also be 
explained if halleys comet formed outside the solar system and 
then through some gravitation perturbation became trapped in an 
orbit of the sun wyckoff said this is considered improbable 
because of the great distances between the sun and other stars 
wyckoff said the speculation will be tested this summer when 
another periodic comet called brorsenmetcalf makes its nearpass 
by the sun 
she said astronomers will use the same technique used on 
halleys to sample the chemistry of the cloud boiling out from 
brorsenmetcalf as the comet zips past the sun 
wyckoff said astronomers can sample the chemistry of a comet by 
using a powerful telescope to capture light reflected from the 
cloud around the object and then breaking this light into its 
wavelengths through a sensitive instrument each chemical isotope 
has a specific spectrum signature enabling experts to measure the 
chemical ratios she said 
the comet study is being conducted by wyckoff and peter a 
wehinger of arizona state eric lindholm of princeton jeanmarc

than a week to try to persuade chinese authorities to give a visa 
to zhu juwang who quit his post at the united nations in geneva 
china contends zhu 28 resigned voluntarily and that they 
replaced his diplomatic passport with an ordinary one after his

because of his marriage to a foreigner 
zu zuginshun who identified himself as a diplomatic counselor 
at the embassy said officials in beijing told the embassy they 
would lelt zhu leave when the embassy informed central authorities 
that zhus fatherinlaw in naples had found him a job 
the fatherinlaw phoned the embassy tuesday about the job zu 
said 
he said zhu did not want to resign the embassy job and wanted 
another post 
the problem is all resolved zu said in an interview he 
can leave at any moment 
an hour after the interview a friend of ms riccardi said she 
had not been told yet of any decision 
earlier in the week an official at the italian embassy in 
beijing said the chinese informed the embassy they were discussing 
the matter with the united nations in geneva and new york and would 
issue zhu a passport once the question about his resignation is 
clarified

a missile race in the middle east is eroding 
israels aerial supremacy and could dramatically change the 
balance of power in the region janes defense weekly said 
wednesday 
it said iraq syria egypt and saudi arabia have missiles that 
could reach israel and libya is rushing to catch up introducing 
even more unpredictability 
arab countries are pursuing billiondollar arms programs 
emphasizing missile development janes said 
israel has possibly 100 nuclear weapons and its survival always 
has depended on air supremacy the respected military affairs 
weekly reported 
the acquisition by iran and major arab military powers of 
increasingly sophisticated missiles capable of carrying nuclear 
warheads is eroding israels technological superiority 
particularly its traditional supremacy in the air it said 
according to janes this has forced israel to consider 
fundamental changes in its military strategy 
through us aid and participation in research on spacebased 
defense israel is trying to develop an antimissile missile 
janes said and its launch last year of a satellite with potential 
stretagic applications alarmed the arabs 
it said the equation changed significantly last year when 
saudi arabia disclosed it had chinesemade df3a css2 missiles 
with a range of nearly 1700 miles and capable of carrying 
13megaton nuclear warheads or 5290 pounds of high explosive 
the df3as were intended as defense against iran although 
they can easily reach israel the weekly said 
growing arms industries in brazil argentina china israel and 
some arab countries undermine efforts by major industrialized 
nations to limit third world access to missile technology and 
restrict systems to a 180mile range and 1100pound payload 
janes reported 
iraq and egypt are working with argentina to develop a missile 
based on argentinas condorii system with a range of 625 miles 
and a 3300pound warhead that could carry nuclear or chemical 
weapons it said 
the weekly said libya was reported to be negotiating with brazil 
for oteiba missiles which have a range of 235 miles and cited 
reports that china is helping iran build a plant to manufacture 
500milerange missiles iran already has chinesemade c801 and 
c601 antiship missiles it said 
iran syria iraq jordan and libya have soviet scud missiles 
with 190mile range janes said and some with egyptian and 
north korean assistance have extended their range with strapon 
boosters 
iraq was believed to have done that in the late stages of its 
war with iran in which a truce was reached last august 
syria has more than 100 scuds plus an estimated 36 scarab 
missiles that could reach israeli cities the magazine said 
israels nuclearcapable jerichoi missiles have a range of 375 
miles and it has tested an advanced version with an estimated range 
of 1000 miles the magazine said it added that the israelis also 
have about 150 usmade lance missiles with a range of 60 miles

a knifewielding man wednesday 
slashed 10 dutch paintings from the 17th century including several 
by pupils of rembrandt a museum spokesman said 
it is an enormous disaster said willem de paus a spokesman 
for the dordrecht museum estimating the damage at many millions 
of dollars 
the attacker a 61yearold unemployed man slashed paintings by 
albert cuyp nicolaas maes and ferdinand bol in the latest among 
several recent thefts and acts of vandalism in dutch museums 
the man who was not identified further under dutch judicial 
practice was being held in nearby papendrecht after he gave 
himself up to police his motive was not known 
de paus was unable immediately to identify the paintings by 
title 
the man entered the museum about 145 pm and inflicted very 
bad damage to the paintings displayed in three rooms before he 
was spotted by a guard via a remote television camera de paus said 
two guards tried to overpower the attacker but he managed to 
escape by threatening them with the knife according to de paus 
theyre really very heavily damaged from some of them he cut 
whole chunks and others have large diagonal slashes de paus 
said it was too early to establish whether the paintings were 
beyond repair he said 
the damaged paintings were from the core of the museums 
collection paus said 
in december three paintings by vincent van gogh were stolen 
from the netherlands kroellermueller museum the works have not 
been recovered 
in may three paintings among them a van gogh and a work by 
paul cezanne were stolen from amsterdams municipal museum they 
were recovered 11 days later 
the incidents have raised concern over security in dutch 
museums where government budget cuts have seriously reduced 
staffing levels

the panama canal commission chairman announced 
wednesday he was canceling a board meeting because of harassment by 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega against waterway employees 
the meeting of the five americans and four panamanians on the 
board that oversees the canals operations was scheduled in 
baltimore on april 5 and 6 all of the members known as directors 
are appointed by the us president 
this decision is the result of the numerous unprecedented 
actions by noriega against canal employees said chairman william 
r gianelli 
if noriega keeps putting this pressure on canal employees it 
could endanger the operations of the canal said michael rhode 
the commissions secretary we believe the canal should be kept 
out of politics he added in an interview 
rhode said the panamanian directors had not participated in the 
boards quarterly meetings since january 1988 
this january the panamanians came to the meeting and read a 
statement saying they would not take part as long as the united 
states continues to recognize eric arturo delvalle as their 
countrys president rhode said delvalle was ousted by noriega in 
february 1988 
the absence of the panamanians has not affected operations of 
the board and the running of the waterway because the us 
directors are in the majority rhode said 
but gianelli feels the canals administrator dennis mcauliffe 
and his senior staff cannot come to the baltimore meeting at this 
critical time rhode said 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drug trafficking 
charges and the united states has refused to recognize the 
authority of his ally president manuel solis palma 
as the bush administration vowed to continue efforts to force 
noreiga to step down the panamanian government began to take steps 
against the canal workers such as denying them license plates for 
their cars 
the 1977 panama canal treaties give the united states primary 
responsibility for canal operation and defense until dec 31 1999 
when panama assumes responsibility and sovereignty over the 
waterway

there is conclusive evidence that eating 
chemically tainted great lakes fish can cause health problems in 
humans a researcher said wednesday at a workshop assessing the 
impact of pollutants on nature 
at greatest risk are infants born to women who eat fish once a 
week caught by noncommercial anglers said wayland swain former 
director of the us environmental protection agencys great lakes 
research laboratory in grosse ile mich 
citing several previous studies swain said such infants tended 
to be born early with low birth weights small head circumferences 
neuromuscular problems and impaired responses to visual stimuli 
researchers have found that toxic pcbs contained in the fish can 
be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy said swain 
vice president of the eco logic consulting company in ann arbor 
mich 
although the research is not new swain said he is the first to 
compile studies on the problem 
he presented his report to the workshop organized by the 
international joint commission made up of representatives of the 
united states and canada the panel acts as an advisory committee 
to governments of both nations on issues relating to the great 
lakes 
other researchers at the twoday workshop discussed health 
problems in wildlife caused by pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls 
toxic chemicals used in electrical and industrial equipment but 
banned in the united states since the early 1970s 
problems cited include reproductive difficulties and physical 
deformities in birds snapping turtles and otters that live in the 
great lakes region 
pcbs are generally very resistant to degradation both in 
the environment and in the human body swain said 
despite the national ban they have remained in the environment 
and are collecting at the bottom of all the great lakes he said 
there are a number of cleanup efforts proposed and some of 
them have been started he said 
my impression is given the effects were seeing across the 
animal species and in the human organism we need to accelerate 
those efforts swain said 
he said his report is based on studies that include a continuing 
investigation by wayne state university researchers in detroit of 
313 mothers and infants 
the researchers are investigating whether the health problems 
noted in infants of mothers who eat great lakes fish continue into 
early childhood 
swain said a similar study of taiwanese infants found effects 
durable into early childhood 
children of taiwanese women who ate pcbtainted rice oil did 
less well on all scales of intelligence than children who were 
not exposed to the chemical he said 
swain said researchers need to determine which of 209 possible 
pcbrelated chemicals are the most toxic 
only a relatively few of them are the real culprits in 
producing the toxicity problem he said 
fish caught by sports fishermen are the most likely to be 
affected swain said 
human consumption of fish sold commercially is generally 
controlled and regulated through the fda us food and drug 
administration so we dont presumably come in contact with 
contaminated fish he said 
fish caught by anglers of course are not regulated 
the workshop was organized to give participants about 100 
scientists from great lakes states and provinces a chance to 
compare research and to encourage more cooperation in identifying 
environmental problems and their solutions said commission 
spokeswoman sally colemisch

president bush has provided a reasonable 
framework for rescuing the thrift industry but his plan relies 
on economic assumptions that may prove too optimistic the general 
accounting office reiterated wednesday 
those rosy predictions about such factors as interest rates 
the economic outlook and the growth of deposits mean the plans 
costs are likely to be somewhat higher than those currently 
forecast the gao said in a report that repeated the conclusions 
its officials offered in congressional testimony earlier this month 
the independent congressional agency also disagreed with the 
administrations plan to finance the multibilliondollar bailout 
separate from the federal budget 
financing the rescue plan as part of the budget is desirable 
the gao said because that would allow financing at the cheapest 
available rates the agency said the offbudget strategy could add 
1 billion to the overall bailout cost during the next decade and 
45 billion over 30 years 
the house and senate banking committees are considering bushs 
plan under which the administration proposes to shut down or merge 
about 350 insolvent institutions and meet commitments from last 
years rescue of 205 others 
bush also proposed placing new capital requirements on thrifts 
and splitting up the responsibilities of the federal home loan bank 
board which operates 12 regional banks 
the administration has estimated the plan will cost 150 billion 
to 200 billion through 1999 including financing costs the 
congressional budget office using the administrations own 
economic assumptions forecasts a 205 billion figure 
without coming up with its own price tag gao said it questioned 
assumptions in the rescue plan that interest rates will fall 
sharply from levels at the end of 1988 higherthanexpected rates 
could increase financing costs and hurt shaky institutions 
the gao also said a recession which some economists believe is 
likely in the next several years could increase the number of 
failing thrifts 
and it said deposits may grow more slowly than the plan assumes 
cutting premium income the plan could cost an extra 7 billion 
over 10 years if deposits grow at only 3 percent a year instead of 
the assumed 7 percent according to rep rep paul kanjorski 
dpa who requested the gao study

the army wednesday sealed off the occupied 
lands for 24 hours and put the entire gaza strip under a curfew as 
troops and police braced for violence on the annual land day 
protest by arabs 
arabs on thursday will mark land day commemorating a 
confrontation in their villages in israels galilee on march 30 
1976 when six people were killed after the army and police opened 
fire on demonstrators protesting government seizure of arab land 
this years land day protest is drawing widespread concern in 
israel officials and newspaper editorials have warned of an effort 
by leaders of the 15month uprising in the occupied territories to 
bring their protest into israel itself 
ariel sharon israels rightwing trade minister said wednesday 
that israelis will not tolerate arab violence within their country 
those radicals among the israeli arabs must understand it will 
not be possible to push the jews endlessly to the wall he said 
last year 30000 israeli arabs marched on land day in support 
of the palestinian revolt there were no major incidents inside 
israel but four palestinians were shot to death in clashes in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the underground palestinian leaders have called for a general 
strike thursday and leaflets distributed in gaza urge palestinians 
to make the land anniversary an occasion to escalate the uprising 
and burn the land under the zionists 
the army sealed off the occupied lands for 24 hours beginning at 
midnight wednesday 5 pm est banning all palestinian travel to 
and from the west bank and gaza the measure was to prevent land 
day violence a spokesman said 
he said the entire gaza strip was placed under curfew as of 8 
pm wednesday 1 pm est that forced the palestinian population 
of 650000 to stay indoors 
when tension rises we have no other choice but to respond 
with wideranging curfews army chief of staff lt gen dan 
shomron said if necessary the army will act very decisively 
i hope the residents understand that to think were just a 
stonethrow away from a palestinian state is only an illusion 
thousands of extra troops were sent to the occupied lands in 
the west bank town of bethlehem hundreds of soldiers were seen 
taking up positions along main roads 
also in bethlehem a palestinian died when an unidentified 
object exploded inside his house the army said arab reports 
suggested the man whose name was not given might have been making 
a bomb 
in scattered stonethrowing clashes three palestinians were 
wounded by army gunfire arab hospital officials said at least 412 
arabs and 18 israelis have been killed since the palestinian 
uprising began in december 1988 
the army said reporters would only be allowed to travel to the 
occupied lands thursday accompanied by military officials 
inside israel leaders of the 810000 israeli arabs also have 
declared their own general strike 
they say the main purpose is to protest unfair treatment such 
as inadequate municipal funding but agree that land day protests 
are also a show of support for the palestinian rebellion 
we are citizens of israel and part of the arab palestinian 
people this is a form of support for their uprising said 
mustafa abu rias municipal council head in the galilee village of 
sakhnin we are acting under the symbol of support for the 
uprising two states for two people 
anticipating trouble police forces have canceled all vacations 
and launched a special operation to counter any land day problems 
inside israel 
we have about 5000 men including 4500 police and border 
police and 500 soldiers said police commissioner david krauss 
we will have sufficient forces to deal with every deviation and 
disturbance 
last week members of new police special patrol units and 
100 high school students held a mock battle in the northern town of 
afula in preparation for land day the students chanted slogans and 
threw rocks and fake firebombs 
arab activists made preparations too 
palestinian flags flew from mosque roofs and utility poles new 
proplo slogans were scrawled on walls in several galilee villages 
in kafr kanna three vehicles were set ablaze and police said they 
suspect arab nationalist motives were involved 
youths in sakhnin where three people died in the 1976 riots 
said they have prepared bottles and other things in case police 
intervene in land day demonstrations

the disabled exxon valdez had complied with 
all modern construction standards for oil tankers but it tore open 
in alaskan waters because no design is immune to the consequences 
of human error a coast guard official said wednesday 
a spokesman said however that the coast guard plans no 
disciplinary action against any of the tankers officers unless the 
results of an investigation by another federal agency of the oil 
spill show it is warranted 
investigators from the national transportation safety board 
looking into the nations worst oil spill said they were focusing 
on actions of the ships captain joseph hazelwood exxon officials 
said he had left the bridge to his third mate when the ship hit a 
charted reef friday and spilled 101 million gallons of oil into 
prince william sound 
its a very new ship i dont see any deficiencies at all 
said joseph angelo assistant chief of the coast guards merchant 
vessel inspection and documentation division 
the safety board is investigating because the coast guard which 
is responsible for tracking vessels in the sound could be a 
subject of the inquiry said coast guard spokesman capt randy 
peterson 
angelo said the 967foot exxon valdez built in 1986 meets all 
the latest construction and equipment requirements including the 
installation of ballasts designed to protect against oil spills 
the current standards that exist for the most modern tankers 
are good said angelo but no matter what you do you cant 
cover every possible aspect if human error is involved 
the coast guard supervises the design and construction of major 
merchant marine vessels and conducts annual inspections of vessels 
flying the us flag he said it has authority over more than 500 
major ships and thousands of smaller vessels 
the exxon valdez one of 72 oil tankers that have loaded crude 
oil from alaskas north slope was last given an inspection 
certificate in november 1988 angelo said its certificate expires 
in 1990 with an interim inspection slated this november 
the exxon valdez was constructed with a single bottom rather 
than the double bottom used in some ships built in the late 1970s 
when the government was considering requiring the added layer as a 
protection against oil spills he said 
instead an international standard for oil tankers was adopted 
which requires waterfilled ballasts around portions of the ship 
rather than the double bottom the ballasts offer some protection 
against oil spillage if a ship either hits bottom or is in a 
collision 
the exxon ship has several ballasts but the impact was too 
severe for them to prevent damage exxon authorities have said the 
tanker has five holes in its starboard side the largest of which 
is 6 by 20 feet 
coast guard spokesman peterson said officials would await the 
results of the ntsb investigation before deciding whether 
disciplinary action might be taken against hazelwood or any other 
officer of the exxon valdez when it ran aground the ship was 
being operated by its third mate gregory cousins who records show 
was not licensed in prince william sound 
the coast guard which licenses all maritime officers and issues 
merchant marine documents to other members of ships crews has the 
power to take away licenses for negligence misconduct or 
incompetence said licensing official frank flyntz 
flyntz said hazelwood since his license allowed him to operate 
the largest ships was a highly qualified ships master who had 
passed extensive training and licensing procedures 
licenses for merchant ships officers have to be renewed every 
five years 
coast guard records show that hazelwoods license was issued for 
the third fiveyear period in new york on dec 12 1986 declaring 
him master of ocean steam or motor vessels of any gross tons 
he also was qualified as a radar navigator and was licensed for 
prince william sound 
cousins whom flyntz described as a highly qualified 
individual was licensed last jan 12 in new orleans as a second 
mate one degree higher than the post he had on the exxon valdez 
he also was qualified as a radar navigator which would include the 
ability to use radar to spot the shoreline and other ships but not 
an underwater reef he is not licensed for the sound 
pilotage licenses have arduous requirements flyntz said 
including the ability to take a blank piece of paper and map the 
waterway with all navigational marks shipping channels and depths 
from memory

a houston procurement firm has been fined 
13500 for allegedly violating federal antiboycott regulations by 
agreeing to require a shipper not to move goods on vessels 
blacklisted by the arab league the commerce department said 
wednesday 
the fine was imposed on daiichi jitsugyo inc a us subsidiary 
of daiichi jitsugyo ltd of toyko whose houston office purchases 
oil and gas drilling equipment 
daiichi allegedly agreed to require a shipper moving equipment 
to oman to agree not to ship goods on vessels blacklisted by the 
arab league it also allegedly failed to report that it received 
boycottrelated requests 
most arab league countries boycott goods and services from 
israel and maintain lists of people and companies doing business 
with israel 
daiichi agreed to pay the civil penalty but did not admit or 
deny guilty 
in an earlier case the firm in 1980 agreed to pay a 9000 
penalty for allegedly furnishing prohibited information and 
violating the reporting requirements of the antiboycott law 
the export administration act prohibits us individuals and 
companies from providing information about their business 
relationships with boycotted countries and from refusing to do 
business with others because of foreign boycotts 
the antiboycott provisions were adopted to keep us firms from 
participating in foreign boycotts which are not supported by the 
united states or which are directed toward countries friendly to 
the united states

the nations first 
private spaceship blasted off wednesday for a 15minute suborbital 
flight that sponsors hope will usher in the age of the us 
commercial space industry 
its the first of many and we think its the real 
breakthrough said bill vance whose company space services 
inc launched the consort 1 
i thought it was terrific said carol lane director of the 
transportation departments division that licensed the consort 1 
its a great beginning 
the rockets payload of six scientific experiments underwent 
nearweightlessness for a little more than seven minutes during the 
flight 
the rocket rose 178 miles and fell to earth about 58 miles north 
of its launch pad at white sands missile range 
houstonbased space services which employs 14 people is the 
same company that pioneered private space exploration by launching 
the conestoga 1 from matagorda island texas with a dummy payload 
in september 1982 
the company dealt with 18 government agencies to get permission 
to launch consort 1 it even had to obtain an export license from 
the state department because the dummy payload landed in 
international waters in the gulf of mexico 
the reagan administration in an effort to open outer space to 
private enterprise directed the transportation department to 
process and issue launch licenses and help cut red tape with other 
federal agencies 
its been a sixyear countdown weve been in a long hold 
said vance space services vice president for finance and 
adminstration when we went up in 82 there was no 
infrastructure for commercial launches to happen 
space services plans similar suborbital launches in the next 
couple of years and is applying for a license to be the first 
private contractor to send a satellite into orbit 
in fact we see the sounding suborbital rocket business as 
where well get a foothold in the industry and the orbital business 
is where well make the big bucks space services spokesman mark 
daniels said 
i think theres a big future for this said space services 
management analyst jim davidson 
the transportation departments 22employee commercial space 
transportation department expects to process 10 launch licenses 
this year lane said 
five companies are offering private launch services and 
florida hawaii and virginia are considering offering spaceports 
for private companies she said 
consort 1 cost 1 million to 2 million the rocket consisted of 
a modified terrier navy rocket booster with a black brant sounding 
rocket as a second stage a 17inchwide 11footlong capsule 
held the payload the entire vehicle stood 52 feet tall and weighed 
6000 pounds at liftoff 
consort 1s payload consisted of experiments that normally are 
carried aboard the space shuttle as getaway specials but the 
experiments didnt need to undergo days of nearweightlessness 
the six experiments were assembled by the university of 
alabamahuntsvilles consortium for materials development in space 
one of 16 commercial development consortiums sponsored by the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
the payload included experiments designed to measure how liquids 
mix in weightlessness how plastic foam forms and cures how 
liquids coat glass surfaces how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and 
how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce 
alloys 
the experiments have applications in medicine the manufacture 
of metal alloys and in construction of space stations 
university spokesman dave dooling said a preliminary look at the 
contents showed the flight was successful 
the scientific team and the ssi team are both extremely happy 
with the results dooling said we think this is an outstanding 
beginning not only for space exploration but for space 
experimentation

mitsubishi heavy industries to develop its nextgeneration fighter 
jet but negotiations continue with the united states over 
coproduction an official said 
the defense agency official said on condition of anonymity that 
the agency decided to sign a contract with mitsubishi on thursday 
or friday even if tokyo and washington do not reach a final 
agreement on the fsx project by then 
takaaki yamada vice president of mitsubishis aircraft 
division called the decision a step forward in the fsx joint 
development project 
a group of japanese legislators meanwhile said on wednesday that 
japan might want to build the fsx aircraft on its own 
us and japanese officials have been meeting this week in 
washington to conclude an agreement on joint development of the 
plane 
japan says agreement must be reached by friday so money for it 
can be included in japans budget for the fiscal year beginning 
april 1 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said wednesday us 
officials are not sure if accord will be reached by then he said 
the delay is due directly to president bushs insistence on 
safeguards to protect us technology 
bush said tuesday he still wants to clarify the agreement 
administration sources said the questions remaining involve who 
will own technology resulting from the project and what percentage 
of the fighters development should be done in the united states 
persisting disagreement over the fsx agreement has generated 
annoyance in japan over us objections to an accord originally 
reached last year 
on wednesday 43 legislators from the governing liberal 
democratic party presented a petition to the government urging it 
to proceed with development of the fighter with or without us 
help 
we have decided that joint development of the next fighter is 
important for the security of our country and should go ahead 
immediately under the agreement since it is crucial to our national 
defense the petition said 
however if there is a concern on the us side we should 
scrap the agreement and develop the jet independently 
under the fsx agreement signed late last year st louisbased 
general dynamics would join mitsubishi as a subcontractor in 
developing the fsx as an advanced version of its f16 fighter 
bush said last week he endorsed the pact for joint development 
of the fsx fighter which was concluded by the reagan 
administration but wanted some changes to protect us technology 
proponents say the agreement was the best deal the united states 
could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to buying 
usmade f16s 
us opponents of joint fsx development complained it amounts to 
a giveaway of advanced aircraft technology that japan could use to 
compete with the united states in the world civilian aircraft 
market 
japanese opponents argued that tokyo should scrap the accord and 
go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on its own 
japan has the ability to develop the fsx independently the 
defense agency official quoted a member of japans defense security 
investigation committee as saying wednesday 
we should cope with the us objection by preparing a 
blueprint for independent development of the fighter

utah officials excited by the prospect 
that two scientists may have unlocked the secret of the sun with 
basic chemistry have pledged 5 million to expand the experiments 
into nuclear fusion 
and the resigning head of the national aeronautics and space 
administration confirmed in washington on wednesday that he will 
head up the project 
university of utah president chase peterson said the 5 million 
will sustain the research while the university and state officials 
negotiate with 200 private corporations that have indicated an 
interest 
the chairman of the universitys chemistry department and a 
british professor announced last week that they had done what has 
stumped scientists for more than 30 years creating energy by 
fusing atoms in glass flasks at room temperature scientists around 
the world greeted the announcement with enthusiasm and skepticism 
including one who warned that if the socalled cold fusion had 
occurred it could pose a serious radiation threat 
the implications of such a discovery are enormous cheap safe 
simple electrical power in an era dominated by petroleumfueled 
political tensions 
potential applications range from 100 horsepower power plants 
small enough for a car to 50megawatt generating plants said 
james brophy university vice president for research 
we know the science is true we dont know about the 
engineering and economics he said 
gov norm bangerter announced tuesday that the legislature will 
convene april 7 to appropriate the funds house and senate leaders 
who had balked on the appropriation until the experiments were 
confirmed were sold on the idea after peterson outlined the 
process during a closed meeting earlier tuesday and promised that 
the agenda for the special session would be limited to fusion 
because the university has applied for patents on the fusion 
process lawmakers are hoping that the state will realize a 
financial windfall by licensing private corporations to use the 
technology 
the numbers are staggering in terms of what this thing will 
bring in if the patents hold said house speaker nolan karras 
house majority leader h craig moody said wednesday he had no 
doubt the legislature would approve the funding its not a 
matter of if it will happen but when he said 
the cash will help the university lure five to 15 world 
experts in fusion and engineering peterson said 
james fletcher 69 the nasa chief who has already been 
recruited is a physicist who was the universitys president from 
196471 
if they do verify the experiment fletcher said it is 
really something gangbusters that would be the best thing thats 
happened since i guess the atomic bomb and that was bad but in 
terms of breakthroughs it would certainly be a bigger factor than 
the transistor when that was built but the jury is still out 
we still have to verify it he added 
university officials said edward teller recognized as the 
father of the hydrogen bomb may visit the campus sometime next 
week 
fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs 
the real question is how do we stay out in front of the world 
on this this identifies utah as a center now for coldfusion 
research peterson said at the news conference 
electrochemists stanley pons of utah and martin fleischmann of 
the university of southampton in england announced last thursday 
that they had sustained fusion for more than 100 hours in a flask 
they said they generated four watts of electricity for every one 
watt they used to power their device 
pons and fleischmanns research will be published in may by the 
journal of electroanalytical chemistry and an article has been 
submitted to the british science journal nature said university 
spokeswoman barbara shelley 
peterson acknowledged the process could prove invalid or without 
practical application but he said he believed the research was 
solid he said several scientists whom he did not identify had 
reviewed the pons and fleischmann article and were optimistic the 
experiment did in fact produce fusion 
john soures a university of rochester fusion researcher said 
that if the utah experiment actually produced energy it also 
emitted dangerous levels of neutron particles

the supreme court heard arguments wednesday on 
whether sculptor james earl reid of baltimore was an employee or an 
independent contractor when he created third world america 
depicting the plight of the homeless for a washingtonbased group 
in 1985 with a handshake the community for creative 
nonviolence a homeless advocacy group commissioned a sculpture 
of a man woman and infant huddled on a steam grate the group 
auctioned donated works of local artists to pay reid 15000 for 
expenses and assistants reid donated his time 
when the group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of 
several cities to raise money for the homeless reid objected 
saying the work was too fragile he urged the group to have the 
work cast in bronze or make a master mold but the group declined 
reid who had the sculpture while making some repairs refused 
to return it and registered it under his name 
the community for creative nonviolence filed suit claiming 
exclusive copyright ownership a federal judge ruled the sculpture 
was a work made for hire and the group had the copyright 
but a federal appeals court overturned that decision saying the 
group owned the work but must share the copyright and any profits 
with reid 
robert alan garrett the organizations attorney told the 
supreme court that in an employment relationship the employer has a 
right to control the product and that congress has recognized such 
a relationship can exist without a written contract 
garrett said organizations have been relying on such laws in 
their dealings with artists 
joshua kaufman reids attorney argued that an agreement 
doesnt constitute employment unless theres a written contract and 
the employee receives all the benefits of employment 
if employers dont provide benefits theyre not entitled to 
fruits beyond the product he said 
this whole issue attacks the spirit of creativity reid said 
after the arguments referring to the statue displayed nearby reid 
said the work that you see is mine my spirit my vision my 
artistry 
garrett however said the group provided reid with the idea 
its specifications and the groups experience with the homeless 
the case is community for creative nonviolence vs james earl 
reid 88293

a group of senators wednesday called on health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan to extend a program 
that provides the drug azt to aids victims who cannot afford the 
costly treatment 
the program is due to expire friday 
without swift action by the administration lifesaving 
treatments will be abruptly terminated for thousands of people with 
aids said the letter signed by sen edward kennedy dmass 
sen orrin hatch rutah and 11 others 
two weeks ago the senate turned back a kennedysponsored bill 
to extend the program when three republican critics refused to let 
the measure be acted on without debate or consideration of 
amendments 
kennedys bill would require the department of health and human 
services to redirect 5 million in federal aids funds to the azt 
program for use through september 
currently nearly 7000 aids victims are receiving azt under the 
program the average cost of the drug treatment is 600 a month 
georgia and kansas have already run out of federal funds 
allocated to them under the program and idaho kentucky and utah 
are due to run out of money at the end of this month according to 
the human rights campaign fund an aids advocacy group 
programs in other states including texas and california which 
account for about a third of all enrollees will have spent all 
their federal money by the end of june other states have enough to 
hold them through the end of august the aids group said 
if the program expires 2875 people would be affected by the 
end of june and 4767 by the end of september the aids group said 
hhs has reprogrammed 10 million under the program since it was 
renewed last september however the senators said the department 
had been authorized to redirect 15 million and they added it 
was the desire of congress when this program was continued that the 
department of health and human services fully fund the program 
through the reprogramming of available aids funds

with divorce as common as it is schools should 
familiarize children with its painful reality the new president of 
an organization of school psychologists said wednesday 
even if a child is not going through a divorce he or she may 
have friends who are and needs to know how to react to their 
troubles said howard m knoff associate professor of psychology 
at the university of south florida 
knoff speaking at the annual convention of the national 
association of school psychologists said 40 percent of all current 
marriages in the country will end in divorce and 40 percent to 50 
percent of all children born in the past decade will at one time or 
another live in a singleparent family 
knoff said the knowledge that a child is not alone in his or her 
difficulties and that parents are still available for support is 
essential to coping with divorce 
children commonly feel they are somehow to blame for the breakup 
these reactions often involve depression withdrawal 
grieving fear and decreased academic and other school 
performance knoff said 
he recommended more counseling and teaching about divorce 
especially for children whose parents are splitting up

attorney general dick thornburgh said 
wednesday hes concerned about a very serious threat of erosion 
in the caliber of people seeking federal law enforcement jobs 
because of low pay 
i cant speak highly enough of those who are engaged in the 
federal law enforcement effort in general today but im extremely 
concerned about the failure to keep abreast of the pay and benefit 
needs of these employees thornburgh said during a luncheon 
meeting with reporters 
he said he was stunned that federal agents such as those who 
work for the fbi and the drug enforcement administration who were 
considered the elite in the 1970s have now reversed roles with 
their state and local counterparts 
thats not all bad he said because it means state and 
local law enforcement agencies are attracting the type and caliber 
of personnel that they need to do their job 
but it does mean that there is a very serious threat of 
erosion in the quality and quantity of the type of people that we 
need in federal service thornburgh said 
ive pledged to my people that ill be a very outspoken 
proponent of their needs he said 
thornburgh said he was concerned not only for the fbi and dea 
agents but also for us marshals prison officials and law 
enforcement personnel in other areas such as the treasury 
department 
in fact the fbi and dea fare reasonably well compared with such 
treasury department agents as those in the secret service and the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
fbi agents start at just over 31500 and can go as high as 
45000 after about seven years according to fbi spokesman greg 
jones the only people who earn more are in management except for 
those in new york there under a fiveyear congressionally 
authorized demonstration project agents earn 25 percent more than 
their salary would be anywhere else because of the high cost of 
living in new york he said 
at the dea nonmanagement agents start at about 24000 and can 
reach in the upper 50000 range according to dea spokesman con 
dougherty 
secret service director john r simpson told a senate panel 
earlier this month that his service was offering 18000 to 
incoming agents and recently had lost a threeyear agent to the 
suffolk county police force in new york where hell earn 55000 a 
year 
meanwhile stephen e higgins director of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms told the senate hearing that starting salaries in his 
bureau were 15000 to 18000 
on other issues thornburgh said 
he is impatient to get his staff in place and has short 
lists of candidates for virtually all the agencies his department 
oversees such as the immigration and naturalization service the 
marshals service and others the short list in some cases 
includes the incumbent he said but he would not disclose for 
which agencies or when announcements would be made on the 
appointments 
he plans no more audits of any agencies such as those that 
severely criticized the operations of the ins and the marshals 
service because those audits were leaked to the news media im 
never going to run another audit again he said 
theyre supposed to be management tools and not hammers to be 
used to embarrass people he said 
his two top aides robert ross and murray dickman have been 
the main people involved in screening of possible judicial 
candidates and that function will remain in his personal office 
they are working with people from the white house counsels office 
in that effort he said 
asked whether he would be concerned about a judicial candidates 
membership in restricted private clubs thornburgh said it was a 
political question and thats something that i think the 
president and his staff are going to have to face with regard to 
what the opinions are on the senate judiciary committee

netherlands and luxembourg and his aide were shot and killed 
wednesday five weeks after the imam distanced himself from irans 
death sentence for author salman rushdie 
imam abdullah al ahdal a 36yearold saudi arabian and moderate 
moslem and salem el behir a 40yearold tunisian who headed the 
brussels mosques social services and library were shot at close 
range in the imams office in the mosque police said 
no one immediately claimed responsibility and no arrests were 
made police said there were no witnesses and that no one heard the 
gunshots 
the two men each were shot twice once in the head and once in 
the neck police said unconfirmed reports said three hooded men 
were seen jumping from a van entering the mosque and then coming 
out again 
the bodies were found by members of the islamic community early 
wednesday evening 
on feb 14 iranian revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini issued a death sentence for rushdie for the satanic 
verses a novel many moslems consider blasphemous 
in a feb 20 interview on rtbf belgiums frenchlanguage 
television network ahdal agreed that rushdies book was 
blasphemous 
but he said of khomeinis death sentence one should not have 
done that rushdie should have first appeared before an islamic 
tribunal he should have explained himself defend himself he 
should have been asked to repent 
in democratic societies everyone has the right to speak his 
thoughts to express himself as he wants ahdal said 
claude van engeland an rtbf reporter said wednesday the 
network had received angry phone calls after the interview from 
callers who claimed ahdal who spoke in arabic was improperly 
translated 
ahdals mosque in a park near the european economic community 
headquarters is part of the londonbased world islamic league 
after the killings police cordoned off the building 
at one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the 
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun several police 
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her 
they said later she was ahdals widow 
rushdie a briton who was born in india to a moslem family but 
no longer practices religion is in hiding in britain moslems 
object to the satanic verses because of a brothel scene in 
which prostitutes take the names of the prophet mohammeds wives 
and because it suggests mohammed wrote the holy koran instead of 
receiving it from allah 
members of the islamic community told reporters outside the 
building their mosque takes a very conciliatory tone 
we respect everybody one said on condition of anonymity 
we do not take radical positions 
ahdal had been in brussels for six years heading the moslem 
community in belgium the netherlands and luxembourg his aide had 
been here for about 10 years 
mohammed sulim a professor of islamic religion asked the 
moslem community to remain calm 
he said we are a few days from the ramadan which moslems 
mark with a month of fasting during the day 
these are days for prayer one must not seek revenge the imam 
was a tolerant man a generous man he lent his money to several

planned parenthood criticized usair wednesday 
for giving discount fares to an antiabortion group whose los 
angeles convention ended in 700 arrests but an airline spokesman 
said politics is not the basis for discounts 
it raises serious legal and moral questions when an airline 
grants consumer discounts to an organization that is by its own 
admission going to break the law by preventing people from 
exercising their rights to reproductive health care said david 
andrews planned parenthood acting national president 
andrews said the discounts encourage the group operation 
rescue in its efforts to disrupt the rights of american 
citizens planned parenthood advocates voluntary family planning 
and says people have the right to choose whether to have children 
the antiabortion group blockaded a los angeles womens clinic 
saturday in defiance of a federal court order police in riot gear 
arrested 725 operation rescue protesters citing most for 
trespassing most of those detained were released 
the los angeles incident was the largest of several operation 
rescue actions against abortion clinics in several cities 
usair spokeman david shipley confirmed that operation rescue 
members got discount fares for their los angeles convention but 
said he did not know how much they were 
he said the airline routinely offers discounts of 30 to 40 
percent to any large group holding a meeting or convention 
including planned parenthood the discount is based on the groups 
size the season and the market and not on its beliefs shipley 
said 
we cant make judgments based on political social or other 
factors were an airline we carry people he said

a lawmaker from the governing motherland 
party shot and killed an opposition deputy in the parliament 
building wednesday the city prosecutor said 
a third lawmaker said he had argued with the gunman over this 
weeks elections and that the gunfire was intended for him 
prosecutor akin oncul said deputy idris arikan was detained and 
will appear at a hearing on thursday arikan allegedly shot 
abdurrezzak ceylan who died while undergoing surgery on the chest 
wound 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency said a ballistic report 
indicated the bullet was fired from arikans gun 
but arikan issued a statement saying that ceylan a member of 
the true path party was shot by another deputy zeki celiker an 
independent 
i drew my gun to protect myself a ballistics report will 
prove that the shot was not fired from my gun arikan said 
oncul said celiker was interrogated after the incident but was 
not detained 
celiker said he was questioned as a witness and that the 
gunfire was intended for him 
arikan drew the gun on me when we were arguing ceylan held 
his arm i walked away and then heard the shooting celiker said 
oncul said arikan and celiker handed over their guns for 
ballistics tests 
two reporters kenan harunoglu and anatolia reporter ismail 
bezgin said they heard the shooting 
i saw ceylan on the floor bleeding and arikan walking around 
with a gun in his hand and muttering to himself bezgin said 
no one is allowed to enter parliament armed but halim aras 
deputy speaker of parliament said it is not always possible to 
search deputies for arms 
arikan and celiker were from the southeastern province of siirt 
ceylan 37 also was from the province and had been a member of 
parliament since 1983 
anatolia said arikan and celiker argued over the results of 
sundays local elections in which the motherland party suffered 
defeats nationwide 
the news agency said arikan held celiker responsible for his 
partys defeat in siirt where the social democrat populist party 
won the mayors race in the provincial capital when rightists 
votes were split between arikans motherland party and ceylans 
true path party 
celiker belonged to true path before becoming an independent 
interior minister mustafa kalemli ordered police to take 
extraordinary security measures in siirt to prevent clashes after 
the slaying 
this is a very ugly incident i hope the reason is not 
political not a bullet was fired under this roof in half a 
century said former premier suleyman demirel leader of the true 
path 
premier turgut ozal telephoned demirel on wednesday and 
expressed his regrets over the killing

canada announced wednesday a review of the 
investigation that concluded ice on the wings was the probable 
cause of the 1985 gander air crash that killed 256 americans 
nearly all of them servicemen heading home for the holidays 
transport minister benoit bouchard told a news conference that 
confidence in the the aviation safety board was jeopardized by 
internal division over the threeyear investigation into the 
nations worst air disaster 
he said retired supreme court judge willard estey will review 
the investigation and present his report in 90 days 
after disputes that often became public the safety board issued 
the report in december approved by five of its nine members 
concluding that ice on the wings was the probable cause of the dec 
12 1985 disaster in gander newfoundland 
four members issued a minority report that said an inflight 
fire or explosion was the most likely cause of the crash killed 
were 248 us soldiers heading home to fort campbell ky from 
mideast peacekeeping duties and eight american crew on the arrow 
air charter dc8 
the new review will look only at how the boards investigation 
was conducted it will not come to any conclusions about the crash 
itself stopping short of the full judicial review demanded by 
critics of the investigation 
the safety board was formed in 1984 so an independent agency 
would investigate accidents rather than the transport ministry 
bouchard said the government still intends to create a new 
agency to investigate all types of transportation accidents as had 
been speculated for some time 
he also named a judge to handle the investigation of the march 
10 crash of an air ontario fokker f28 jet at dryden ontario 
although the safety board already had started its own work 
the crash whic killed 24 was the first fatal crash of a 
regularly scheduled commercial flight in canada in 10 years 
justice virgil moshansky of the alberta court of queens bench was 
named to investigate it

the new review will look only at how the boards investigation 
was conducted it will not come to any conclusions about the crash 
itself stopping short of the full judicial review demanded by 
critics of the investigation 
the safety board was formed in 1984 so an independent agency 
would investigate accidents rather than the transport ministry 
bouchard said the government still intends to create a new 
agency to investigate all types of transportation accidents as had 
been speculated for some time 
he also named a judge to handle the investigation of the march 
10 crash of an air ontario fokker f28 jet at dryden ontario 
although the safety board already had started its own work 
the crash whic killed 24 was the first fatal crash of a 
regularly scheduled commercial flight in canada in 10 years 
justice virgil moshansky of the alberta court of queens bench was 
named to investigate it

after years of bitter debate president francois 
mitterrand on wednesday reopened the louvre as a gleaming 
hightech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the 
main entrance to the medieval palace 
visitors poured in for their first look at the sixyear 850 
million overhaul designed by american architect im pei and still 
in progress when renovations are finished in 1993 the 
centuriesold building will be the worlds largest museum 
the interior of the pyramid is even more extraordinary than 
the exterior i think the modernism goes very well with the 
classical style said franck domingue a parisian who fought his 
way inside the museum that is now known as the grand louvre 
its light its beautiful its superb said martine 
bieriduminy who lives nearby and watched the pyramid go up 
in the beginning people in the neighborhood were against it 
they thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture she said 
but now that it is completed its good for the louvre its good 
for paris its good for france she said 
visitors who once lost their way in dark dusty painting 
galleries on their way to the mona lisa or winged victory 
are sure to appreciate the spacious and airconditioned interiors 
illuminated by skylights 
the days of searching for the louvres entrance also are over 
its hard to miss the 70foot transparent pyramid rising gracefully 
between the museums two main wings in the center of the napoleon 
courtyard 
flanked by three smaller glass pyramids and nightlighted 
fountains the pyramid crowns a vast underground lobby featuring 
ticket windows boutiques an expanded bookstore and a 400seat 
auditorium with topquality acoustics 
from there escalators branch out like the spokes of a wheel 
connecting the pyramid to other portions of the museum and reducing 
the distance visitors once had to trek from one end of the ushaped 
louvre to the other 
the sense of orientation is the primary concern when 
redesigning an encyclopedic museum pei said in an interview 
the pyramid is the center of gravity and one radiates from there 
to the italian french and antiquities collections very easily 
the view from below is breathtaking the baroque achitecture 
added to the louvre in the 19th century looms against the 
everchanging paris skyscape 
i used to pray for sun pei said afterward i realized 
that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it 
takes on the moodiness of the paris sky 
the pyramid links visitors to the underground vestiges of the 
first louvre castle built by king philippe auguste in 1200 as a 
military stronghold to protect paris from english invaders 
from specially built wooden walkways visitors can stroll among 
the restored ruins including the base of the castle keep and 
rounded turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it 
remodeled as its royal habitants demanded more comfort and 
luxury these vestiges were unearthed during recent excavations 
under the cour carre and are displayed under soft yellow lighting 
also on display is a history of the louvre itself documented by 
thousands of artifacts dug up in the napoleon courtyard they bring 
to life the daily routines of parisians over the centuries 
lovers of 15th century and 17th century french art will enjoy 
airy highceilinged galleries on the third floor overlooking the 
cour carre and the pyramid the paintings have been cleaned 
reframed and hung at eyelevel against gray walls illuminated by 
skylights 
this is a gigantic transformation said pierre rosenberg 
the louvres head curator of paintings the real issue is 
creating rooms where one can both learn and enjoy 
one hundred paintings have been taken out of storage on view 
for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by charles le 
brun titled lhistoire dalexandre 
when the grand louvre is completed in 1993 it will house 4000 
items nearly double what it displays today with 650000 square 
feet of additional floor space hundreds of paintings will have 
been taken out of storage and shown publicly for the first time 
peis pyramid in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass 
to be cleaned twice a month by alpine climbers was the most 
controversial aspect of the renovation project initiated by 
mitterrand 
five years ago i had my doubts pei said not many people 
would have bet on this project 
but pei and mitterrand held firm and the tide turned in their 
favor when a fullsize cable model was erected on the spot 
all through the centuries the louvre has undergone violent 
changes pei said the time had to be right i was confident 
because this is the right time

a former justice department official testified 
at oliver norths trial wednesday that in the early frantic search 
for facts about the irancontra affair no one bothered to ask the 
boss president reagan about a possibly illegal 1985 arms 
shipment to iran 
did anybody think to ask this man whether he approved the 
transfer of missiles asked norths lawyer brendan sullivan 
pointing to an easel where he had written in 2inchhigh letters 
pres 
the questioning of the president was going to come after we 
had questioned everybody else said charles cooper a former top 
aide to thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
sullivans intense crossexamination of cooper underscored the 
defenses effort to have the former president appear in court to 
testify for the former white house aide north has subpoenaed 
reagan but us district judge gerhard a gesell has not ruled 
whether he will enforce the summons 
reagans lawyer filed a paper with the court wednesday insisting 
that norths defenders say precisely why they want him as a witness 
and what questions they will ask 
the justice department filed court papers seeking to quash 
norths subpoena for reagans appearance suggesting written 
interrogatories as an alternative 
unlike any other citizen a president and a former president 
both have a duty to protect the presidency and to assure that 
national security and international pece are not compromised 
unnecessarily said the department because it is he who 
speaks for the nation any hurried statement and any answer to a 
surprise question pose a risk to the nation 
the department said the court should consider whether answers 
to written interrogatories would provide north with all of the 
essential facts necessary to a fair trial 
the issue of whether reagan administration officials knew that 
hawk missiles were aboard a november 1985 flight to iran was raised 
at a nov 20 1986 white house meeting attended by cooper national 
security adviser john poindexter and his aide north cia director 
william casey and cia official robert gates cooper said meese was 
there for part of the meeting 
cooper said the topic was testimony casey was to give the next 
day to the house intelligence committee cooper said north proposed 
that casey say no one in the us government knew that the shipment 
contained arms 
cooper said he learned after the meeting that secretary of state 
george p shultz remembered hearing about the hawk shipment a year 
earlier and telephoned meese about the discrepancy 
after cooper did some followup work by talking to people at the 
cia wasnt it time to ask reagan about the november 1985 shipment 
sullivan asked the witness 
i dont know whether it was time to do so but we did not do 
so cooper said 
reagan was asked by the tower commission what he remembered 
about the shipment in which usmade hawks were flown from israel 
to iran in an attempt to gain freedom for five american hostages 
held in lebanon 
the commission headed by former republican sen john tower of 
texas quoted reagan as saying he objected to the shipment and as a 
result the hawks were returned to israel however in another 
meeting with the commission reagan said he could not remember any 
meeting or conversation in general about hawks and that he did not 
recall anything about calling back the missiles 
in the filing with the court wednesday reagan attorney theodore 
b olson said he wants to know from north the specific evidence 
sought by him from the former president and whether it is 
information essential for his defense and not available from other 
less intrusive means 
under an order issued by gesell north submitted to the judge a 
sealed statement of what testimony he wants from reagan but olson 
said in a filing with the court he hasnt been allowed to see it 
and therefore cant respond 
meese one of the last prosecution witnesses wound up his 
testimony wednesday his second day on the stand he was the 25th 
prosecution witness in the trial now in its ninth week 
it was because of discrepancies over the 1985 shipment reagan 
authorized meese on nov 21 1986 to conduct a factfinding 
inquiry which led to the discovery in norths office the next day 
that iran arms sale money had been siphoned to help the contras 
meese said he summoned north to his office on nov 23 a sunday 
the former attorney general testified that after twice urging north 
to tell the truth the national security aide withheld critical 
details about the diversion 
north is charged with falsely telling meese that the national 
security council had no involvement with the diversion and that 
israel a conduit for the arms actually determined the amount of 
money funneled to the contras in fact north and other us 
officials were directing the secret operation investigators later 
determined 
meese testified that north did not mention the involvement of 
codefendants richard secord or albert hakim in the affair and he 
acknowledged that north hadnt mentioned the role of swissbased 
attorney willard zucker who set up dummy companies for the 
irancontra operation 
the exattorney general also said north hadnt mentioned how the 
price of the arms sold to iran had been marked up by 270 percent 
with some of the excess going to the contras 
although the judge has not indicated whether he will direct 
reagan to comply with a subpoena issued by norths lawyers which 
would be an unprecedented appearance for a former president 
gesell has made a number of courtroom references to a possible 
reagan appearance at one point he said preparations should be 
made in the event reagan should appear 
and while meese was testifying gesell stopped a question about 
reagans opinion saying youve asked to have the president 
here hes coming he knows what his views were 
whether that reagan appearance would be in person or merely on 
videotape is one of many issues concerning reagan yet to be 
resolved 
prosecutors already have the former presidents answers to 
written questions and gesell ordered the attorneys wednesday to say 
whether they object to providing those to north

a judge wednesday dismissed a murder charge 
against a man accused of killing a policeman because members of the 
citys elite antidrug squad lied to get the search warrant for a 
drug bust that ended in gunfire 
state attorneys said they would appeal the superior court 
judges decision and try to have the murder charge against albert 
lewin reinstated 
judge charles m grabau told a packed courtroom that he had no 
choice but to dimiss the case against lewin 33 who was accused of 
shooting detective sherman griffiths during the feb 17 1988 raid 
a fair trial is not possible grabau said the 
commonwealths conduct was egregious and the evidence is 
tainted 
but assistant district attorney paul leary said his office would 
continue battling for the cases reinstatement despite the 
conflicting and fraudulent evidence submitted by prosecutors and 
detailed in the judges 30page ruling 
we say the lie doesnt reach the level of egregiousness the 
judge believes it does leary said its in our interest to go 
right to the supreme court 
leary said authorities would seek thursday to keep lewin in jail 
without bail while they pursued the case which has raised 
questions about whether police routinely lie to obtain search 
warrants 
defense attorneys have said the case proves a pattern of police 
abuse in obtaining search warrants and could result in new trials 
for dozens of convicted drug dealers who were arrested after 
possibly illegal searches 
but leary said his office set little store by the cases broader 
implications 
im fighting to have this case reinstated leary said im 
not too concerned about any other cases 
the slain detectives family condemned the judges ruling 
charging him with making a gutless decision 
we are devastated and outraged by the judges ruling said 
the victims brother tommy griffiths 
griffiths a 36yearold member of the police departments elite 
drug control unit was trying to break into an apartment in the 
citys dorchester section when lewin allegedly fired a bullet 
through the door and killed him 
officers had obtained a search warrant based on testimony by an 
informant named john grabau dismissed the case last month after 
detectives failed to produce john in court saying they could not 
find him further lewin did not match the search warrants 
description of the cocaine dealer police had sought 
last week the detectives admitted lying about the existence of 
john who they said was actually a composite of two other 
informants 
the judge agreed to consider reinstating the murder charge 
against lewin after the detectives submitted affidavits clarifying 
the informants joint role in the arrest on wednesday grabau said 
a fair trial was not possible 
the pattern of misconduct from the date of the tragic death 
to the present has been pervasive egregious deliberate and 
intentional he said 
assistant district attorney francis omeara has argued the 
detectives lied to protect their sources from vengeful drug dealers 
and to increase their chances of getting a search warrant 
but max stern lewins defense attorney said the explanation 
did not excuse the detectives repeatedly fraudulent actions 
it was not a lie it was hundreds of lies stern said and 
in an effort to reinstate the case it was just more lies 
three detectives carlos a luna 32 hugo amate 31 and paul 
schroeder 33 have been suspended with pay while under 
investigation by massachusetts attorney general james shannon for 
perjury

the opposition and the government will not 
meet their monday target date for concluding talks on political and 
economic reforms and legalizing solidarity lech walesa said 
walesa chairman of the banned independent union movement and 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak decided after a 12hour 
meeting wednesday that april 5 is the earliest possible date for a 
final agreement in the 8weekold roundtable talks 
it is going quite difficultly but it is not hopeless 
walesa said early thursday as he returned to warsaw from the talks 
in a government residence south of the capital 
we are moving slowly toward the end although there are some 
hard subjects he said we agreed on 80 percent of the 
problems 
kiszczak and walesa could meet again early next week solidarity 
advisers indicated 
walesa and about a dozen advisers looked discouraged as they got 
off a small bus in front of the headquarters of the roman catholic 
church episcopate 
an official statement on the meeting issued by the staterun 
pap news agency said walesa and kiszczak agreed that the working 
teams will continue work so as to hold the final roundtable 
plenary conference on april 5 
the talks which began feb 6 were scheduled to have their last 
workinggroup sessions on thursday and the communist party central 
committee was to meet friday on ratifying the agreement 
but the results of the meeting between kiszczak and walesa left 
doubts on whether the agreement would be ready by then 
walesa and kiszczak said earlier they wanted to sign the final 
accord at a plenary session of the negotiators on april 3 
solidarity adviser bronislaw geremek said the opposition side 
spent the easter weekend studying written agreements reached so far 
but that some problems remained in the areas of politics the 
economy and trade unions 
the general outlines of the farreaching agreement were reached 
some time ago 
in exchange for legalization of solidarity outlawed after the 
martiallaw crackdown of 1981 and other opposition groups the 
opposition would agree to participate in parliament elections in 
june that would guarantee the communist party and its allies 65 
percent of the 460 seats 
a presidency and a senate of about 100 members would be created 
the opposition would be expected to win the senate which would be 
picked in a completely open democratic popular vote 
the communist party would be expected to get the presidency 
elected jointly by the parliament and the senate owing to the 
partys strength in the larger parliament 
in addition the opposition would have access to the mass media 
including a daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one 
program on national tv and radio 
in economic reforms authorities would agree to a formula of 
indexing workers wages to compensate for polands unabating 
inflation more than 60 percent last year 
authorities agreed to the talks in august during the years 
second nationwide wave of crippling industrial strikes officials 
have expressed hope that agreement with the opposition will provide 
political and labor stability so that economic reforms have time to 
work 
they also hope that the accord will help persuade the west to 
invest in poland and help the country finance its 39 billion 
foreign debt 
among the difficulties that remain in the talks are the 
oppositions demand that all workers dismissed for 
solidarityrelated activities in the past be rehired the details 
of the formula of wage indexation and differences on the size and 
the powers of the senate and the powers of the new presidency

federal authorities have smashed a 
billiondollar international operation laundering drug money and 
forced colombias medellin cartel to alter the way it handles drug 
profits the justice department said wednesday 
attorney general dick thornburgh fbi director william sessions 
and other top law enforcement officials said their operation 
polar cap has ended with charges against 127 people and two latin 
american banks most of the charges related to cocaine possession 
and distribution and money laund ering 
but justice officials said one of the defendants eduardo 
martinez eluded capture in panama by the panamanian defense forces 
after he holed up in a bank there wednesday us authorities had 
relied on the defense forces for assistance despite the fact it is 
headed by panamianian gen manuel noriega who is himself under a 
federal indictment for drug trafficking 
charles saphos chief of the justice departments narcotics and 
dangerous drug section said the panamanian defense forces had 
detained martinezs private plane that he had flown to panama city 
as well as his pilots are are hoping hell come back so they 
can arrest him 
thornburgh called the investigation the largest 
moneylaundering crackdown ever carried out by the federal 
government 
agents seized a half ton of cocaine and 45 million in cash 
jewels and real estate and filed civil actions in an effort to 
seize as much as 412 million more in assets of the banks banco de 
occidente of panama and banco de occidente of colombia that are 
deposited in us bank accounts 
the operation reaching across the united states into south 
america and to england had direct ties to the medellin drug cartel 
of colombia and laundered 12 billion over two years justice 
department officials said 
the cartel is responsible for as much as 80 percent of the 
cocaine flowing into the united states according to federal drug 
officials 
there is no more effective way to deal with the business of 
drug traffickig than to take the profit out of it thats what has 
happened with operation polar cap thornburgh said at a news 
conference 
i think its fair to describe this operation as a very hostile 
takeover of a major money laundering operation he said 
us officials said the laundering operation played a 
significant role in the handling of the cartels illegal drug 
proceeds and was known within the drug world as la mina or 
the mine 
agents learned of the ring while operating an undercover 
moneylaundering operation of their own in atlanta as part of a 
joint investigation by federal agencies including the internal 
revenue service and drug enforcement agency 
authorities said that undercover agents received complaints from 
alleged drugworld figures that they were moving too slowly in 
their laundering or processing the money into seemingly legitimate 
accounts 
the agents were told la mina could get the money by wire from 
los angeles to panama within 48 hours according to court documents 
released with the indictments 
federal agents then expanded their investigation into that 
operation using electronic intercepts surveillance and pursuit of 
financial paper trails 
thornburgh said that while it is difficult to determine how much 
impact the federal action will have on the medellin cartel 
common sense tells me when you disrupt an operation that has 
laundered over a billion dollars in two years youre going to 
force some adjustment in their operation 
dea administrator john lawn said that one indication of the 
effect was seen immediately by drug agents when la mina was forced 
out of business he said the phone was ringing off the hook at 
the undercover moneylaundering operation that was continuing in 
atlanta with requests for use of their services 
the atlanta agents were so busy they laundered 4 million in 
three days he said 
if there were other facilities within the united states for 
the laundering of money they would not have come back to a minor 
moneylaundering operation that was causing them trouble with 
getting their money moved quickly lawn said 
arrests began in los angeles in february where federal agents 
charged that large amounts of money was being laundered through 
jewelry dealers who allegedly used phony gold shipments to cover 
the transactions 
thornburgh told reporters during a luncheon meeting in his 
private dining room that martinez of medellin colombia was holed 
up in a bank in panama that was surrounded by panamanian defense 
forces he had been scheduled to meet with undercover agents in 
panama on wednesday 
however later in the afternoon martinez somehow managed to 
escape from the bank said bruce pagel a trial attorney with the 
justice departments narcotics section 
i dont know what the logistics were pagel said the last 
information i had was he was not in custody and they are not 
expecting to take him into custody at the moment 
lawn said the panamanian forces had continued to cooperate with 
dea despite noriegas indictment 
obviously they are circumspect in dealing with them 
thornburgh said of dea these are not naive individuals on the 
other hand theyre faced with the necessity of having to deal with 
law enforcement in central and south america and i assume theyre 
doing the best they can 
martinez is described in the indictment as an associate and 
agent of geraldo moncada whom the government accused of 
organizing supervising and managing for the medellin cartel the 
importation sale and distribution of cocaine in the united states 
and in particular in new york 
the justice department said that among the indictments resulting 
from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed in 
atlanta and eight people arrested tuesday evening in new york 
federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in atlanta miami 
new york and the san franciscosan jose area the department said 
an indictment charges that the general manager of banco de 
occidente of panama william guarin and other bank officers 
authorized the use of the bank to accept wire transfers on behalf 
of the cartel thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegal 
activity by us banks and that the banks cooperated in the 
investigation

police issued an international alert 
for an executive who vanished with 33 million in cash and left the 
countrys largest search and rescue operation near collapse 
authorities said wednesday 
john friedrich head of the nonprofit national safety council 
made headlines nationwide when he disappeared late last week 
australian media said he apparently had no passport was not 
listed on voter rolls and did not have a social security number 
police said they were not sure if friedrich was the mans real 
name his wife shirley pleaded on national television for her 
husband to come home and clear up this mess 
prime minister bob hawke on wednesday said there was no evidence 
friedrich 44 had any links with overseas intelligence services 
as suggested in news reports 
there have been so many fanciful claims made including that 
this missing person is a cia agent hawke said ive had all 
these things checked out and im assured there is no substance in 
these things 
federal police said interpol the parisbased international 
police network was on the alert for friedrich after he was 
reported seen in auckland new zealand and in west germany 
weve got no solid evidence as to whether hes alive or dead 
or if hes in australia or has fled the country a police 
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity he just vanished 
the national safety council was founded in 1927 and is based in 
the state of victoria aside from the military it is the countrys 
largest search and rescue organization with 29 airplanes and 
helicopters 
but the council has debts of 180 million and the government 
has refused to bail it out 
police said the organizations debts were not the result of 
criminal activity by the council 
newspapers said friedrich duped banks in australia and overseas 
into providing loans based on false invoices for equipment that was 
supposed to serve as collateral 
the reports detailed how friedrich engineered the phenomenal 
growth of the council transforming it from a oneaircraft 
operation into an organization with 450 employees 
questions were raised as far back as 1975 about the search and 
rescue operations finances according to reports 
aides said friedrich always sent a deputy to board meetings in 
his place and arranged for couriers to deliver financial documents 
at the last minute so they would be signed without much study 
board president max eise said in an interview with the sydney 
morning herald newspaper that friedrich once lied about where he 
was born and then said im a nonperson 
some politicians have called for a royal commission of inquiry 
the highest form of investigation into friedrichs activities 
following police reports that he might be an illegal immigrant 
a police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said an 
investigation was hampered by conflicting dates on friedrichs 
credentials including his marriage certificate 
friedrich received the order of australia the countrys highest 
award last year a spokesman for governor general bill hayden said 
wednesday he could be stripped of the honor if it is found he is 
not an australian citizen

larry tucker said a three fourweek trial on the treasurers 
removal probably will be held in late may 
earlier the house voted 3960 against a move to censure and 
publicly reprimand the 61yearold democrat a lesser rebuke 
favored by manchins supporters 
the house did approve the censure of state auditor glen gainer 
for his role in the losses the bulk of which occurred from april 
to june of 1987 manchin and gainer serve with the governor on the 
board of investments which supervises investments managed by the 
treasurers office 
when you consider the leadership of the house thats 
behind all of this and how theyve been twisting arms and pushing 
im not surprised at the outcome of this vote manchin said i 
have committed no wrong im going to stay around as long as i 
can 
one of manchins supporters delegate pat bradley referring to 
manchins popularity said voters know hes not a financial 
genius what they do know is he is a leader 
bradley said manchin would fight the attempt to oust him 
manchin testified during 10 days of hearings before the house 
judiciary committee that he knew little about investments he said 
he was betrayed by subordinates he hired to run the consolidated 
investment fund that lost the 279 million 
the committee approved the articles of impeachment monday 
delegate marc harman a republican who headed the impeachment 
move said the evidence against manchin met the state 
constitutional standard of impeachment for maladministration 
incompetency neglect of duty and high crimes and misdemeanors 
the articles specifically charge manchin with failing to 
supervise the fund delegating his power and authority making 
improper investments paying out funds that were not earned and 
covering up the losses 
delegation does not mean abdication harman argued you 
simply cannot delegate to the point where you have no 
responsibility 
if convicted by the senate manchin would be removed from office 
and would be ineligible to run again a conviction also would 
likely lead to the loss of his pension estimated to be at least 
2128 a month 
the last time a west virginia treasurer was impeached and 
removed from office was in 1876 
 
manchin who has spent 40 years in state government was first 
elected state treasurer in 1984 and was reelected last fall

the oil that is defiling alaskan waters has 
revived painful memories for those who saw the california coast 
blackened by greasy sludge 20 years ago in a calamity that helped 
spawn the environmental movement 
its the same thing all over again only on an even larger 
scale said lawyerenvironmentalist robert hopps who was a high 
school senior when the santa barbara oil spill occurred on jan 28 
1969 
the message is you cannot trust the oil companies you cannot 
believe their representations regarding the safety of oil 
operations hopps said wednesday by phone from santa barbara 
where he recently ended his term as president of get oil out or 
goo which was formed after the spill 
about 101 million gallons of oil have flowed into alaskas 
oncepristine prince william sound in the nations worst oil spill 
which happened when the supertanker exxon valdez ran onto a reef 
friday 
the santa barbara spill occurred because of the blowout of an 
improperly cased well on an offshore drilling platform operated by 
union oil co of california 
the california coastal commission marking the 20th anniversary 
of the spill recalled that it spewed more than 325 million 
gallons of oil over 800 square miles of water covered 100 miles of 
coastline and beaches with a thick tarry black goo smothered 
thousands of birds fish and other sea life and helped trigger a 
new age of environmental awareness 
a spokesman for union now unocal corp has disputed those 
statistics contending that only 30 miles of coastline were 
affected by a spill of no more than 840000 gallons however the 
western states petroleum association has said at least 21 million 
gallons spilled 
unocal which paid about 16 million in settlements as a result 
of spillrelated lawsuits also disputes claims that oil still 
leaks from the spill site it says the leakage is the result of 
natural oil seepage from the sea floor 
unocal and other oil companies still drill for oil off santa 
barbara in 1969 there were 10 oil platforms in santa barbara 
channel at the beginning of this year there were 22 with 
applications pending for six more 
the petroleum association said the environment has recovered 
from the santa barbara accident which spurred the oil industry to 
institute safer technology and tougher controls for oil drilling 
and production 
michael neushul a biology professor at the university of 
california at santa barbara agreed that based on limited studies 
the spill wasnt an ecological disaster he said that the santa 
barbara channel appears to have recovered from the deaths of at 
least 9000 birds 88 million barnacles 30000 mussels and 51800 
limpets 
however hopps commenting earlier this year on the 20th 
anniversary of the spill sharply disagreed if that was not an 
ecological disaster there is no such thing as an ecological 
disaster he said 
neushul said studies in santa barbara have not proved that the 
fishing industry there was harmed however he said the result may 
be different in alaska where salmon spawning areas could be badly 
damaged 
the alaskan accident will bolster environmentalists because it 
highlights the nowfamiliar ineptitude of the oil companies and 
government agencies responsible for environmental protection 
neushul said 
the latest spill made him think god how can these exxon 
people be so stupid neushul said the key to oil spills is 
dont spill it in the first place 
hopps said memories of the 1969 accident are almost constantly 
there like a nightmare one expects to live with the rest of their 
life 
i saw hundreds of birds covered with oil head to toe some 
already dead others dying i remember beaches inches thick 
with oil and i remember for years afterward swimming in the ocean 
and getting tar and oil on my body 
lois sidenberg a goo cofounder who now is the groups vice 
president said when she learned of the alaskan oil spill the 
first thing i thought of was getting a scotch old fashioned 
she remembered that in 1969 when you went down to the shore 
and looked all you could do was cry it was such a devastation of 
a beautiful area 
alaskans should get on the president and tell him not to 
permit any expansion of oil development sidenberg said 
asked what he would say to alaskans about their spill hopps 
replied its like asking somebody whos lost a loved one what 
you want to share with somebody under similar circumstances they 
have my sympathy and my understanding but the deed is done

investigators used gardening tools and 
metal detectors wednesday to search woods where the bodies of seven 
women have been found since last summer 
police and a search dog discovered the seventh body tuesday in 
freetown and district attorney ronald a pina said it certainly 
was related to the other corpses uncovered in the area which is 
centered around a highway intersection 
superior court judge courtland a mathers granted on tuesday 
pinas request to extend a grand jury investigation into the deaths 
of the women 
the first six whose skeletal remains were found between july 
and december last year had been involved in prostitution or drugs 
in new bedfords weld square area according to family members and 
police 
investigators identified the seventh body wednesday as robin 
rhodes 29 who had been missing from the new bedford area for 
about a year 
pina said rhodes had a history of heroin addiction but no 
record for prostitution 
a forensic expert said the six women died between october 1987 
and april 1988 three more new bedford women have been missing for 
more than a year 
a police dog searched the area where the last body was found 
last fall but was distracted by the scents from several reporters 
and cameramen in the area and the search was called off police 
said 
police resumed searching with dogs on monday because the weather 
was warmer and state police believed the area merited further 
examination 
information from our investigation indicated that we needed to 
be out and searching those areas again pina spokesman jim martin 
said 
police detective gardner greany said investigators were 
searching for items the killer or killers may have stepped on and 
pushed into the ground 
the killer could have stepped on a piece of metal a key or 
something and it might be helpful greany said 
pina obtained a subpoena forcing kenneth c ponte a lawyer who 
investigators say knew at least three victims to appear before the 
grand jury earlier this month 
police have charged a new bedford man with three roadside sexual 
assaults that allegedly occurred in the area of the slayings the 
man neil anderson is free on 15000 cash bail pending trial 
police will not say whether either anderson or ponte is 
suspected in the slayings martin said investigators were not in 
a position to request an indictment at this time

three men were convicted wednesday in the 
exeuctionstyle murder of a rookie policeman whose death became an 
issue in last years presidential campaign and helped set the 
national agenda in the war on drugs 
scott cobb 25 was convicted of seconddegree murder and 
weapons charges for his role in the death of officer edward byrne 
who was shot five times while he sat in his patrol car guarding the 
home of a witness in a drug case 
about two hours later a second jury convicted todd scott 20 
and philip copeland 23 of the same charges two juries were 
required because scott and cobb implicated one another in 
videotaped statements made after their arrests 
the verdicts from both juries were met by cheers and applause in 
the courtroom from police officers and friends and family of the 
slain officer 
byrnes shooting became an issue in the presidential election 
when his father matthew byrne presented thenvice president 
george bush with his sons police shield 
bush who said it was the most emotional moment of the campaign 
for him showed the shield to audiences around the country when he 
spoke about the need to crack down on illegal drugs 
cobb shook his head listlessly as he listened to the jury 
announce its verdict after two days of deliberations in state court 
scott and copeland who grinned as his verdict was read both 
told reporters ill be back as they were escorted from the 
courtroom 
queens district attorney john j santucci hugged and 
congratulated matthew byrne a former police officer who is now a 
lawyer 
the defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life 
on the murder charges and five to 15 years on seconddegree 
criminal possession of a weapon 
judge thomas demakos set sentencing for cobb on april 24 and for 
copeland and scott on april 25 
cobbs attorney michael fishman said he would file an appeal 
after sentencing 
prosecutors charged that the three defendants along with 
another man david mcclary executed byrne on directions issued 
from rikers island by jailed drug lord howard pappy mason 
byrne 22 was shot at pointblank range as he sat alone in a 
parked police car in a drugriddled queens neighborhood early the 
morning of feb 26 1988 
prosecutors said mason ordered the slaying in retaliation for 
his conviction and imprisonment on a weapons charge earlier the 
same week 
it was a declaration of war against our society and a message 
oppose us and die assistant district attorney a kirke bartley 
said in his closing argument monday 
the trial began on what would have been byrnes 23rd birthday 
byrne was guarding the home of arjune a drugcase witness who 
lived in the crackravaged neighborhood police assigned 24hour 
protection to the guyanese immigrants home after drug dealers 
firebombed it in an effort to intimidate him 
arjune who is now in the federal witness protection program 
testified that he saw scott and cobb from his bedroom window just 
minutes after hearing five gunshots on the street below 
other prosecution witnesses detailed a meeting in a queens 
kitchen where the killing was planned while a former drug 
addictprostitute rachel moore placed all three defendants in the 
area of byrnes car when he was killed 
cobb and scott both took the witness stand in their own defense 
each admitted they were there when byrne was killed but denied any 
involvement in its planning or execution 
the fourth defendant mcclary 22 will be tried later scott 
an admitted drug dealer identified him as byrnes killer during 
testimony 
in the wake of byrnes slaying police established the tactical 
narcotics team or tnt which established a heavy police presence 
in the area tnt has since been extended to other drugriddled 
neighborhoods

shipyard from the sea 
police officials said about 200 strikers were arrested and 700 
more strikers were surrounded by riot troopers in a company 
dormitory at least one police officer was injured the officials

attacked but troopers put out the fire with a fire engine and 
there was no explosion police said

broke out previously at the ulsan yard between strikers and 
promanagement workers the company said the protests were costing 
up to 6 million a day in lost business 
korean news reports said most workers at the shipyard wanted to 
work

the united states is willing to help 
the leftist nicaraguan government if its members hold free 
elections 1990 and still retain power us ambassador deane hinton 
said wednesday 
we are willing to help them economically hinton said at a 
news conference the new administration of president bush is 
ready to give more carrots instead of sticks 
hintons comments seemed to go much further than any the bush 
administration has made so far on central american policy 
the administration in its public statements has not been 
specific about rewards it would offer nicaraguas sandinista 
government if it lives up to its promises of democratization 
privately however the state department holds out the prospect 
of economic aid and normal relations if the country meets its 
commitment including holding free and fair elections next february 
despite his comments hinton said the nicaraguan government 
remains the major obstacle to peace in central america because 
the sandinistas keep supplying weapons to the salvadoran rebels 
hinton also said the aid package bush has proposed for the 
rebels opposed to the nicaraguan government would not endanger the 
peace accords signed by the five central american presidents on 
feb 14 
bush on friday announced a bipartisan accord that would allot 
45 million in nonmilitary to the rebels known as the contras 
congress still must approve the aid which would end next 
february 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has said the proposal 
violates the central american peace accords 
ortega and the presidents of guatemala el salvador costa rica 
and guatemala have agreed to come up with a plan by midmay to 
disband the contra force now living in honduran border camps 
an estimated 11000 contra fighters and their family members 
have lived in the camps since the us government cut off military 
aid in february 1988 
nicarguan embassy sources in san jose speaking on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press on wednesday that nicarguan 
foreign minister miguel descoto will denounce the contra aid 
proposal when he meets with fellow central american foreign 
ministers in san jose on thursday and friday 
the foreign ministers are to discuss progress made since the 
feb 14 accords and the contra aid proposal 
guatemalan foreign minister mario palencia arrived in san jose 
on wednesday and told the ap he did not believe us aid would hurt 
the accords 
we are sure the us government is working in good faith to 
support a peaceful solution to the central american crisis he 
said in an airport interview the new humanitarian aid for the 
nicaraguan resistance is not an intervention

the university of central florida finally 
rid of its bats turned its attention wednesday to 100 stray cats 
many of the felines frequently pregnant have been there since 
the early 1970s living on handouts and hunting mice and birds 
the biggest concern over proliferating kitties is the continuing 
fear that theyll give people rabies animal advocates dont agree 
saying rabies in cats is extremely rare 
but administrators feared a cat bite could bring legal action 
and considered extermination caring students resisted perhaps 
remembering tabbies back home 
school attorney ashmun brown met wednesday with humane society 
director frank andrews and heather harden president of ucf campus 
action for animals formed a month ago 
they drafted a plan to capture the cats find them homes and 
get them temporary lodging 
im praying that we can finally get moving on this said ms 
hardin a ucf junior majoring in anthropology these animals have 
suffered long enough 
ms hardin negotiated agreements with area veterinarians to 
provide free vaccination and sterilization and her group compiled 
a list of potential adoptive owners 
the schools last animal crisis occurred in the fall when a 
bat colony turned up in the gym 
the flying mammals made a terrible mess drove basketball 
players volleyball teams and even weightlifters into the street 
and even disrupted a graduation ceremony 
a bat expert contacted in late december put wiremesh plugs into 
tiny cracks and crevices enabling bats to leave but preventing 
them from returning they gradually moved on to other locales

demonstrators impatient for change under new 
soviet policies are wrongly turning to violence in moldavia pravda 
said wednesday 
thousands of demonstrators with signs reading down with the 
government gathered march 19 in kishinev the tiny western 
republics capital the communist party daily said 
a week earlier more than 20000 staged a similar protest and 
several police officers were seriously injured it said 
the grassroots political groups that organized the protests 
seek changes in the republics language and economic and 
environmental policies as well as a crackdown on widespread crime 
and corruption pravda said 
pravda criticized the moldavian communist party leadership for 
adjusting too slowly to the republics changing political life and 
letting the protests get out of hand 
but it also branded some of the local activists aspiring 
politicians ambitious men and simply unbalanced and socially 
immature people 
president mikhail s gorbachev has allowed greater autonomy for 
the soviet republics under his reform policy of perestroika 
however pravda said the moldavian activists were allowing their 
impatience for change to be infected with the virus of 
nationalistic narrowmindedness 
on feb 25 the republics party chief semyon grossu condemned 
nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed a demand to 
change the moldavian alphabet to latin script as it is in romania 
moldavian and romanian are the same spoken language but 
dictator josef stalin imposed the cyrillic or russian alphabet on 
the moldavians after soviet troops occupied the region during world 
war ii 
grossu said work is under way to gradually reinstitute the latin 
script still used in neighboring romania 
moldavia has retained close ties with romania despite repeated 
attempts by moscow to link it more closely with russia the region 
of 42 million people has passed from turkish to russian to 
romanian and back to soviet control over the past century

a fiery explosion tore through a 
15 million automated rocket fuel mixing building at hercules 
aerospace on wednesday damaging the building but causing no 
injuries officials said 
the early morning blast jolted the western salt lake valley and 
lit up the night sky but eight to 10 workers at the site remained 
protected in a distant bunker company spokesman jack demann said 
by midday investigators and officials from hercules incs 
headquarters in wilmington del the air force and the state 
division of occupational safety and health were probing the 
wreckage of the mixing building and adjacent structures said 
spokesman ted olsen 
it could be weeks before the cause is determined he added 
he said static electricity friction and potential problems with 
the mixture all would have to be considered as possible causes 
the explosion occurred at 1205 am in a new section of the 
plant while 25000 pounds of htpb propellant was being prepared for 
a delta ii space rocket booster motor demann said 
the fuel is mixed in giant bowls by stainless steel blades that 
leave it with the consistency of heavy batter the fuel then is 
poured into rocket cases and cured until it becomes solid 
hercules fire crews responded but acting on company policy did 
not try to fight the fire demann said it died out quickly 
the building in which the fuel was mixed is made of concrete and 
reinforced steel with an interior wall separated by 10 feet of

oscar producer allan carr promised the 
academy awards opening number would be the most exciting 15 
minutes in television history 
it seemed like hours 
for the record the man who took la cage aux folles to 
broadway tried to fulfill his promise with a snow white lookalike 
trilling proud mary to hollywood brat packer rob lowe 
that was after the dancers encased in glittery golden 
fivepointed stars trooped onstage 
as oscar audience members stared blankly a snow white 
impersonator with a voice reminiscent of another cartoon heroine 
betty boop strolled through the shrine auditorium singing spoofs 
of popular songs rewritten with oscaroriented lyrics 
a groan swept through the crowded oscar press room minutes later 
when a somber lowe cast as prince charming tried to sing and 
dance he came up a few octaves and steps short 
all of this took place in a recreation of the cocoanut grove 
the nightclub where the academy awards were originally presented 
amid a bevy of sequined hoofers crooner merv griffin introduced 
various cocoanut grove diners including veteran actors vincent 
price alice faye dorothy lamour and roy rogers 
dancer cyd charisse unreeled a few classic tango steps 
when the number mercifully ended lily tomlin strode down a 
grand staircase at center stage 
well i told them that id be thrilled to do the oscars if they 
could just come up with an entrance she said and think of it 
more than a billion and a half people just watched that and at 
this very moment theyre trying to make sense of it 
as she made her entrance miss tomlin intentionally lost a shoe 
she joked about it recalling the late ed sullivans propensity for 
calling a really great show a really great shoe a dancer from 
the chorus line crawled down the steps behind her recovered the 
shoe and tossed it offstage

politicians stumped for memorable quotations 
to enliven their speeches need look no further than respectfully 
quoted a newly published book from the library of congress that 
is crammed with 2100 oratorical gems from the past 
the book might give some comfort to sen joseph biden ddel 
whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a 
controversy over cribbed comments 
if biden recalls a famous line from president kennedys 
inaugural address in 1961 he might be intrigued that lebanese 
writer kahlil gibran asked much earlier are you a politician 
asking what your country can do for you or a zealous one asking 
what you can do for your country 
the book a threeyear project by suzy platt of the librarys

which members of congress or their staffs over the past 75 years 
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and

the elite of american christianity those in 
the upper echelons of power and influence are found in a new study 
to be sharply divided in their socialpolitical views 
they also assume different priorities for their common faith 
on economic and military issues both mainline protestant and 
roman catholic leaders are on the left and fundamentalists on the 
right on familysexual issues mainliners remain on the left but 
catholics join fundamentalists on the right 
the ideological polarization is immense says social 
scientist s robert lichter of washington who made the study with 
two colleagues he added in a telephone interview 
the differences seem to define the left and right poles of 
american political discourse what surprised me is that the 
mainline protestant leaders are so far to the left and catholic 
leaders also are to the left on economic issues 
the study involved replies to extensive questionnaires by 178 
influential figures of mainline protestantism catholicism and 
protestant fundamentalism compiled through nominations by 
denominations and religious journals 
lichter codirector of the center for media and public affairs 
conducted the study with social scientists stanley rothman and 
robert learner of smith colleges center for the study of social 
and political change 
leaders of mainline protestantism an establishment that 
historically has set the tone for american society were found 
liberal on every dimension although members are fairly 
conservative as shown in other studies 
eighty percent of them say they are political liberals as do 59 
percent of catholics compared to only 13 percent of 
fundamentalists differences paralleling recent voting records 
catholic and mainline leaders are much more critical of 
capitalism about a fourth of them saying the us should move 
toward socialism with big corporations taken out of private 
ownership and run in the public interest 
in contrast only 4 percent of fundamentalist leaders feel that 
way 
only slight majorities of mainline protestant and catholic 
leaders 52 and 64 percent respectively believe private 
enterprise is fair to workers compared to an overwhelming 91 
percent of fundamentalists 
more than 80 percent of mainline protestants and catholics favor 
government action to reduce the income gap between rich and poor 
compared to only 43 percent of fundamentalist leaders 
the fundamentalists also are more hawkish than either mainline 
protestants or catholics with majorities of fundamentalists saying 
the us should be more forceful with the soviet union compared to 
only minorities of protestants and catholics 
most fundamentalists also think it is sometimes necessary to 
undermine a foreign government and that the us military should be 
the strongest no matter what the cost with only about a fourth of 
catholics and protestants agreeing 
but on most sexualfamily issues the alignments change only 
small minorities of catholics and fundamentalists 22 and 17 
percent respectively say women have a right to abortion compared 
to 67 percent of protestants 
also most catholics and fundamentalists 64 and 83 percent say 
women with young children should not work unless necessary 
compared to 28 percent of protestants 
majorities of all three groups consider adultery wrong and also 
consider homosexual relations wrong but only fundamentalists 
predominantly say homosexuals should not teach in public schools 
majorities of catholic and protestant leaders say preference 
should be given in hiring blacks and women but only a minority of 
fundamentalists say so 
concerning christian priorities most catholics and protestants 
54 and 57 percent and 95 percent of fundamentalists say 
bringing people to faith in jesus should be the main church focus 
in the united states 
that also should be the main church focus abroad say 90 percent 
of fundamentalists compared to only 51 percent of catholics and 46 
percent of protestants about a fourth or more giving priority to 
improving the lot of the poor 
the choices here as in other areas were related to political 
ideology the report says 
it notes that the vast majority of selfdescribed conservatives 
select faith in jesus as the churchs top domestic priority 
compared to a minority 41 percent of liberals 
catholic leaders resemble their mainline protestant 
counterparts except on issues of sexual morality on which they 
agree more closely with the fundamentalists the report sums up 
adding 
the views these leaders hold on the public face of the church 
are closely related to their own political values thus religion 
and politics seem as intertwined in the lives of americas 
religious leaders as they are in the life of american society

amid two weeks of protests in february against racial incidents 
at penn state university a young white man grabbed a black student 
by the arm and punched her in the eye why dont you protest 
this he said 
during the past two years 160 us colleges have reported 
incidents aimed at black hispanic asian and homosexual students 
and faculty said howard j uhrlich of the national institute 
against prejudice and violence 
between 20 and 25 percent of all minority students on campus 
have been victimized at least once during an academic year 
uhrlich said citing verbal harassment crossburnings hate 
literature beatings brawls antihomosexual graffiti swastikas 
and racially motivated slurs 
the heart of the problem for many large campuses like ours is 
that a majority of our white students grew up in suburban areas or 
small comunities they have had no positive experiences with 
minorities said grant ingle acting director of human relations 
at the university of massachusetts where a 1986 argument over the 
world series erupted into a racial brawl 
pressured by student minority groups colleges increasingly are 
naming provosts for minority affairs recruiting and retaining more 
nonwhite teachers and creating programs to improve understanding 
a minicourse titled race and rutgers began this semester to 
explore race relations at the new jersey university since the 1960s 
william chace president of wesleyan university in middletown 
conn sent students a letter in january that discussed racial 
relations on campus and the film mississippi burning about the 
1964 murders of civil rights activists 
stanford university president donald kennedy reported in 
february on an incident in which two students were barred from 
campus housing for two quarters for defacing a beethoven poster 
with caricatures of a black person and leaving it near a black 
students door 
eightyeight percent of the freshman entering the university of 
wisconsin this fall will have to fulfill a new ethnic studies 
credit requirement 
some minority students calling attention to the issue with 
protests and sitins have labeled these efforts windowdressing 
they charge that colleges have not responded quickly enough and 
have not issued stiff enough penalties 
other critics question administrators commitment to diversity 
some universities have created a minority affairs office or 
program and say they solved the problem i see on many campuses 
where the minority affairs officer doesnt have any power said 
reginald wilson senior scholar at the american council on 
education in washington dc 
yet when you ask people on campus who is responsible they 
point to that person wilson said generally the colleges that 
seem to be responding unfortunately are the ones where something 
has happened 
since the october 1986 world series brawl at the university of 
massachusetts the school has instituted a tougher conduct code 
that more clearly defines what disciplinary action can be taken it 
also has reinstated a freshman orientation program that encourages 
racial harmony 
our world series event was the most visible major racial clash 
on a us campus i think weve been forced to do more in response 
than others said james langley an associate vice chancellor 
todays students did not live through the civil rights 
movement some dont know the significance of martin luther king 
jr some dont even know who he was langley said despite 
effforts to recruit minorities and to keep the issue in the 
forefront we have a situation that needs close watching this 
campus is not settled its not calm he said 
this university has not had any true commitment to 
diversity said traci davis 20 of springfield mass a membe 
of a minorityrights group on the amherst campus she said the 
university needs to redouble its efforts 
penn state a year ago hung posters at its 22 campuses 
proclaiming racism has no place at penn state the posters 
which included telephone numbers to report incidents were a way 
for the university to acknowledge that there some people thought 
racism was a problem on campus said patricia peterson assistant 
vice president for campus life 
black students who said five black women were accosted by 
whites as they walked downtown near the campus demonstrated in 
february chanting racism no racism must go they demanded 
stiffer penalties for racist acts 
right now they administrators are doing surface changes 
said yvette dudley president of the naacp chapter at penn state 
they say they are open to changes but we havent seen any 
structural changes 
nearly a year after implementing the madison plan a blueprint 
for increasing minority participation on the university of 
wisconsin campus the interfraternity council expelled a fraternity 
in november for incidents that included a slave auction where 
pledges donned blackface and afro wigs in skits that mimicked 
contemporary black entertainers that action came a week after a 
university committee announced it could not punish the fraternity 
the university still hasnt developed an effective plan for 
disciplining students said charles j holley past president of 
the black student union 
not all the incidents involve race 
the national gay and lesbian task force in washington dc 
last year surveyed gay student groups on us campuses more than 
70 percent of the 80 to 90 groups that responded reported some or 
much discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation 
said kevin berrill a task force director 
i think most colleges arent doing anything berrill said 
a couple of schools have taken steps but most administrators are 
not dealing adequately with the problem they have their heads in 
the sand

belying their long history as a simple stodgy 
savings tool certificates of deposit have lately become a hot 
and not so simple investment 
at a time when the bloom is off the boom in mutual funds and 
many small investors are shunning the stock market cds have 
received an added boost from the sharp rise in interest rates over 
the past several months 
banks and savings institutions have been slow to raise the 
interest rates they pay on money market accounts 
but in many areas of the country they are competing feverishly 
to attract depositors with generous yields on cds carrying 
maturities in the sixmonth to oneyear range 
brokerage firms meanwhile are offering wide selections of cds 
from banks across the country in a bid to open or keep accounts 
for customers who arent interested in the other merchandise on 
their shelves 
at least two newsletters now compile and publish information on 
the highest yields available for savers interested in buying 
outofstate cds by mail 
just to keep the pot bubbling there is the problem of insolvent 
savings and loans that the government is now struggling to solve 
even with federal deposit insurance covering deposits of up to 
100000 cd buyers are now putting increased emphasis on checking 
into the financial health of an institution before they entrust it 
with their money 
many investment advisers these days are recommending that savers 
buy cds from a brokerage firm 
a broker can offer convenience and a wide selection of cds 
quite possibly with yields higher than what local banks are willing 
to pay 
the brokers typically collect their fees from the institutions 
issuing the cds so the buyer has no commission to pay 
furthermore a broker may offer to buy back a cd from you before it 
matures eliminating the customary penalty for early withdrawal 
a broker would rather see you invest in stocks bonds or 
something he or she would make a higher commission on says 
robert heady in his newsletter 100 highest yields published in 
north palm beach fla 
but if your mind is made up on cds getting them for you is 
better than watching you walk out the door 
the problem is that many brokers dont look closely at the cd 
choices theyre made at corporate headquarters 
heady argues that you cannot assume brokers have thoroughly 
checked the financial status of all the issuers of the cds they 
have for sale 
he also says many brokered cds pay only simple rather than 
compound interest 
whats the difference over time compounding significantly 
increases your actual yield the amount of money your investment 
earns the more rapid the compounding the greater the benefit 
to illustrate this point notes the bostonbased united amp babson 
investment report a oneyear cd with a stated interest rate of 10 
percent compounded daily would pay you more than a similar cd at 
105 percent simple interest 
if you are inclined to buy an outoftown cd directly by mail 
norman fosback editor of the newsletter income amp safety in fort 
lauderdale fla offers these suggestions 
telephone an institution and verify that the quoted rate is 
still in effect and that the institution will pay interest from 
day of deposit without a hold 
ask for a preassigned account number mark your check for 
deposit only and send a covering letter with full instructions 
including your telephone number

the good news according to the milliondollar 
campaign manager is that republicans are at rockbottom strength 
with the 174 house seats the party now holds in the era of nearly 
invincible incumbents that also is their bad news 
while that means republican strength probably wont go much 
lower it also means the odds are prohibitive against any swift 
comeback from 34 years without a house majority 
ed rollins who was a white house political adviser to ronald 
reagan and managed his landslide reelection campaign in 1984 is 
the man assigned to find the way back it involves the political 
equivalent of heavy lifting but it pays well 250000 a year 
probably over the next four years 
that price tag was not popular stirring resentment among some 
of its presumed beneficiaries since house members are earning 
89500 and didnt dare to vote themselves a raise this year 
rollins is the new cochairman of the national republican 
congressional committee the partys house campaign organization 
he says his goal is to make republicans competitive for the 218 
seats that make up a house majority which they havent had since 
the 1954 elections according to rollins that would put the gop in 
position to reclaim the majority in the mid1990s 
they start at what rollins calls a low point 174 out of 435 
seats thats down from 192 after ronald reagans election in 1980 
rollins figures there are 160 safe gop seats in districts so 
securely republican that theyd stay that way even if the national 
campaign organization shut down and did nothing to help 
but seats that look safe come with no guarantees as 
demonstrated tuesday when the republicans lost the indiana house 
seat once held by vice president dan quayle democrat jill long 
took over a seat that had been republican since 1976 that gives 
the democrats 259 house seats with two vacancies awaiting special 
elections 
republicans are trying return the favor next week in alabama 
where a special election will fill the seat left vacant by the 
death of rep bill nichols the longtime democratic incumbent 
that overall margin probably insulates the republicans against 
significant house losses in 1990 the party holding the white house 
usually has suffered house setbacks in midterm elections because 
the presidents party normally gained swing seats on his coattails 
in the previous election but president bush had no such coattails 
the gop lost three house seats in 1988 
so there is no realignment pending in 1990 in either direction 
but the sheer size of the democratic margin and the better than 9 
out of 10 liklihood that an incumbent will be reelected confront 
rollins and the republicans with a mountain to be scaled on the way 
to anything approaching house control 
rollins already has started republican groundwork for the 
reapportionment that will follow the 1990 census which is expected 
to shift 18 house seats out of the northeast and parts of the 
midwest most of them to the southern and southwestern states that 
have become republican territory 
but there will be redistricting to reflect population shifts 
even in states that do not lose or gain seats rollins says 
republicans will have the technical and legal knowhow and the 
political message to take advantage of the changes 
theres no way to guess the outcome but the last time a 
reapportioned house was elected along with a president in 1972 
republicans won nearly twothirds of the open seats 
rollins talks of emerging from the next two elections with net 
gop gains of 30 seats saying that would put a reelected president 
bush within range of a house majority for administration programs 
during a second term he said it would be a philosophical majority 
like the coalition of republicans and conservative democrats that 
gave reagan his early house victories 
if rollins can deliver that kind of progress hell not only 
earn his money he probably should put in for a bonus 
he advocates a strategy based on confrontation rather than 
compromise telling reporters that republican house leaders always 
should think in campaign terms we are in combat he says that 
hard line fits the style of republican national chairman lee 
atwater and rep newt gingrich of georgia newlyelected as the no 
2 man in the minority leadership 
it doesnt mesh with president bushs ideas about bipartisanship 
in administration dealings with the democratic congress but 
rollins doesnt argue he says whatever works to keep the president 
popular works to the advantage of gop candidates 
rollins says confrontation be part of a twotrack strategy with 
republicans going after democrats back home in their house 
districts even while the bush administration seeks bipartisan 
support for its proposals in washington 
but when bush needs democratic votes there is going to have to 
be some political bargaining 
and if that leads to a call from the white house asking gop 
political operators to lay off democrats who may side with the 
administration 
i hope mr atwater is the one who gets that call said 
rollins

sweeping political and economic reforms 
have been unleashed in algeria by nationwide riots last year in 
which hundreds died 
following a constitutional referendum that opened up the 
oneparty system at least 19 political groups are planning to 
contest the monopoly of the national liberation front in 
legislative and municipal elections due this fall 
the riots in october largely directed against the oneparty 
system instituted at the end of french colonial rule in 1962 left 
176 dead by official count government opponents cited figures of 
500 or more killed but they brought changes that fundamentally 
transformed the structure of the state 
the main architect of these changes was president chadli 
bendjedid who was reelected to a fiveyear term in december 
without opposition 
immediately following his election bendjedid opened a campaign 
for a new constitution which eliminated socialism from the 
basic principles of the algerian state and paved the way for the 
introduction of a multiparty system the constitution was approved 
feb 24 by 734 percent of those voting 
in the current period of transition the 19 groups ranging 
from the communist party and islamic fundamentalists to 
westernoriented liberal and social democratic parties are 
adopting their statutes and future programs 
abderezak bouhara executive secretary of the national 
liberation front said there was no reason why a renewed and 
revigorated party could not confront the democratic opposition of 
other groups for the defense of what he called algerias 
socialist achievements 
the front is perfectly capable of playing the democratic 
game he added 
but ali belhadj leader of the islamic salvation front and 
regarded as one of the unconditional extremists of the islamic 
movement said we are for the full and unrestricted application 
of islamic sharia law our only constitution is the koran and the 
place of women is in the home 
other political opinions ranged widely the rally for culture 
and democracy demands that amazigh the language of the kabyle 
people who have lived in algeria since before the arabs arrived be 
recognized as a national language of algeria the leader of the 
social democrats abderrahmane adjerid said we do not only want 
to distribute wealth but to create it notably by encouraging 
private enterprise 
some time later this year an extraordinary congress of the 
national liberation front will take account of the changes and 
adopt a policy for the future until then president bendjedid 
remains the partys president and one of his close allies 
abdelhamid mehri its secretarygeneral 
an anomoly of the the present period of transition the ruling 
party remains dedicated to socialism and oneparty domination 
in fact rejecting views vigorously expressed by mehri the 
party congress took a position against the new constitution this 
reflected the views of the party stalwarts who feared for their 
entrenched jobs and positions 
but the party was greatly weakened shortly afterwards by the 
simultaneous resignation of all its army members many government 
officials are said to be looking to one of the 19 new parties for 
their future political allegiance 
the new constitution requires that any political group that 
requests it be officially recognized and allowed to take part in 
the future elections the only condition is that the party should 
uphold the constitution itself 
the national liberation fronts official organ revolution 
africaine foresaw a plot to liquidate the party beginning with 
the probability of an abandonment of the party by its 
president bendjedid himself 
the chairman of one of the budding new parties said the 
president would form his own party and take into it all those loyal 
to him 
sources close to the president speaking on condition of 
anonymity said it was not unlikely that those loyal to 
bendjedid would seek to establish a new party they said the 
president himself intended to remain above the political turmoil 
some sources said the simplest solution to the national 
liberation fronts problems would be to change its name but 
revolution africaine commented that there was genuine risk of the 
disintegration of the state and a danger for the construction of 
socialism in our country 
this official party view runs close to an open statement of 
opposition to bendjedid 
it is not clear whether the presidents adroit maneuvering will 
enable him to continue in control of the party long enough to take 
charge of a new more liberal political grouping likely to win 
majority support in the algeria of the future

in 1949 a time of intense westwest 
suspicion and hostility the united states canada and 10 european 
nations created the nato alliance to thwart what they saw as a 
military threat from stalins expansionist soviet union 
now 40 year later the world has changed the west european 
allies are soothed by mikhail s gorbachevs words and actions 
they have become less committed to the united states and they 
foresee a stronger independent western europe 
some of the glue of the last 40 years is losing its potency 
said john cross deputy directaor of the international institute 
for strategic studies in london it will need to be replaced by a 
renewed sense of purpose and vision of the way ahead 
and so this is the state of north atlantic treaty organization 
as it marks its 40th anniversary april 4 
we have to adjust to new developments nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner said in an interview 
that of course is a phase which you could call a crossroad 
not changing our basic course but giving it a new vitality perhaps 
even new speed and adjusting to new challenges 
president bush and other nato leaders are expected to take a 
fresh look at the alliances role at a summit may 2930 at natos 
headquarters in brussels 
the alliance is at a point where its less a problem of 
managing a crisis but rather a problem of managing change said 
ole bierring denmarks ambassador to nato 
jane sharp senior researcher at the stockholm international 
peace research institute in sweden said most of the problems 
associated with nato are byproducts of its success 
the key challenge facing the 16 nations of todays nato still 
comes from the soviet union 
president gorbachevs agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his 
promises of reductions in troops and military spending have 
diminished the perception of that threat at least in the publics 
eyes 
it is very very appealing said gen wolfgang altenburg of 
west germany chairman of natos military committee 
since 45 the publics in europe have lived under the 
impression that well the wars over but it may start again but 
now all of a sudden those nations which were considered to be the 
big threat are apparently no longer a threat 
the alliance also faces changes among its members 
americans seeing a prosperous europe question whether 
europeans should carry more of the defense burden europeans 
enjoying wealth and a stronger sense of identity wonder why they 
should put up with foreign troops and extensive maneuvers on their 
soil 
this whole question of burdensharing is more or less the 
question of which role europe plays in the future said 
secretarygeneral woerner 
europes future is being guided in part by 1992 the plan by 
the dozen nations of the european economic community to eliminate 
trade barriers and form a single market by then all but one 
ireland belongs to nato 
some defense officials worry the public euphoria over gorbachev 
will lessen support for defense spending and other commitments 
the allies have just entered into new negotiations to try to 
lessen the easts strength in conventional weapons 
nato wants the soviets and their warsaw pact allies in eastern 
europe to make much greater cuts to bring the two sides roughly to 
equal strength 
the starting positions of the two sides unveiled in vienna 
austria in early march contain surprising similarities leading 
to optimism about an eventual accord 
but the talks have also added fuel to possibly the most 
controversial issue in nato whether the alliance should modernize 
shortrange or battlefield nuclear weapons 
at the heart of the debate is a plan pressed by the united 
states and britain to upgrade the lance surfacetosurface 
missile military analysts say the lance introduced in 1972 will 
become obsolete in 1995 
the missile has a range of a little more than 60 miles its 
replacement would have a range of more than 250 miles just under 
the limits of the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty 
which eliminates us and soviet landbased missiles with ranges of 
about 300 to 3400 miles 
gen john galvin the american who is natos top military 
commander in europe argues that modernizing the lance will enable 
nato to make sharp cuts in nuclear artillery 
the united states wants a firm commitment from the allies before 
it urges congress to approve money to produce the missile 
but strong resistance in west germany where most of the weapons 
would be based has cast doubt 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany said recently he wants to 
delay a decision on the production of the new missile until 1991 or 
1992 after next years important elections he also wants an 
agreement that deployment plans would be scrapped if progress were 
made on cutting the easts conventional arms 
galvin said recently any discussions on reducing shortrange 
nuclear forces should be delayed until after we were satisfied 
with the successes of the conventional arms agreement 
alton keel the us ambassador to nato insisted american 
support for nato remains strong 
but he cautioned us political backing could be put at risk if 
the perception grew in the united states that europeans were not as 
committed 
its not now at risk but it could be he said

religious leaders are applauding a court 
decision in which churches won the right to sue the government to 
protect themselves against spying on their activities 
the outcome could lead to an injunction against such snooping if 
it is found to be common or might be repeated 
calling the decision beautiful the rev james andrews 
chief executive of the presbyterian church usa commented 
it makes a start on a much needed corrective what it says is 
that we are a democratic country and government agents cant go 
into your house my house or gods house without a warrant 
if they do they can be held liable a federal appeals court 
ruled in midmarch in a suit stemming from a 198586 sanctuary case 
bishop herbert w chilstrom head of the evangelical lutheran 
church in america said the decision clears the way for churches in 
seeking to protect the integrity of their ministries from 
government interference 
seventeen religious groups protestant roman catholic and 
jewish had backed the suit challenging government infiltration of 
congregations as undermining their ministry and abridging religious 
freedom 
the us ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco 
asserting that churches have standing to sue on the basis of 
injuries claimed from government surveilance declared 
when congregants are chilled from participating in worship 
activities when they refuse to attend church services because they 
fear the government is spying on them and taping their every 
utterance all as alleged in the complaint we think the church 
suffers organizational injury because its ability to carry out its 
ministries has been impaired 
those crippling disruptions were reported by four arizona 
congregations three of them presbyterian and the other lutheran 
as a result of undercover operations by the immigration and 
naturalization service 
its paid informants were key witnesses in the 1986 conviction 
and suspended sentencing of nine church workers including two 
catholic priests a nun and a presbyterian minister for helping 
provide sanctuary to central american refugees 
over a 10month period the appeals court related several ins 
agents wearing body bugs infiltrated the four congregations 
attending services recording prayers discussions bible readings 
as a result of the surveilance carried out without warrants 
the court says the churches claimed these effects 
some members have withdrawn from active participationa 
bible study group has been cancelledsupport for the churches has 
declined and congregants have become reluctant to seek personal 
counseling and are less open to prayers and confessions 
chilstrom said the trust which binds a community together was 
ruptured by unnecessarily invasive action by government 
afterward the four congregations joined by their parent 
bodies the presbyterian church usa and the evengelical 
lutheran church in america filed suit for damages and a 
restraining order against the ins 
without seeking to justify the sanctuary movement they charged 
the secret government surveillance crippled their religious 
functioning and also violated constitutional guarantees of free 
exercise of religion 
they asked that the ins be prohibited from such surveilance in 
the future without prior established and compelling government 
interest 
a district court in arizona had thrown out the case without 
trial saying constitutional protections of religious rights apply 
only to individuals not church organizations since churches 
dont go to heaven 
reversing that decision appeals court judge william norris said 
churches do come under constitutional protections observing 
it is the churches whose services have been invaded by the 
government and whose congregants are the targets of the 
surveilance with a concrete threat that their religious 
expressions are being recorded and put on file by the government 
andrews said in an interview from presbyterian headquarters in 
louisville that the decision means the government cannot hide 
behind its status to avoid dealing with the issue of whether it was 
doing something wrong 
he said the decision is important to all religious bodies 
adding 
it doesnt say that churches can do anything they want just 
because its in a church building but that the same procedural 
protections of law apply there as well as anywhere else 
the appeals court said it was unable to assess the likelihood of 
future ins surveilance of churches and returned that issue to the 
district court along with the churches request for an injunction 
against such activity 
assuming the government wont carry the case to the us supreme 
court andrews said therell now be a trial and a legitimate 
opportunity to find out whether this surveilance is standard 
procedure or what 
the government will have to answer the question which it 
didnt have to answer before whether it still is doing these 
things if we find out its still occuring we could get an 
injunction against it

a southern baptist layman who helped mobilize 
the christian right in politics warns against being linked to a 
cultural conservatism that doesnt involve belief in god 
ee mcateer a tennessean who left a longtime business career 
to become head of the conservative religious roundtable here said 
in a recent mailing that the movement has its roots firmly 
planted in the judeochristian ethic 
he adds that to embrace people who do not believe in god is 
morally wrong and will result in the building of a political tower 
of babel 
paul weyrich director of the committee for the survival of a 
free congress said in a subsequent mailing that cultural 
conservatism is not some sort of godless philosophy that 
considers god irrelevant but he added 
i welcome the help of all people who reach the same moral 
conclusion even if they have not reached it on the basis of the 
faith 
mcateer said he fears an attempt to use evangelical christians 
for purely political purposes

michael corrigan heard the horror 
stories in high school attend a large university and youll be 
just a number 
still corrigan had his heart set on the university of michigan 
with a main campus enrollment of about 35000 i wasnt scared 
about the size of the university so much as i didnt want to not be 
able to see my teacher when i wanted to if i was having a problem 
or trouble with my work 
then he found out he could have it both ways 
corrigan signed up for the pilot program a livinglearning 
community that offers a personal approach to education through 
small classes taught by instructors who are resident advisers in 
the dormitory where the students live 
the 26yearold program emulated at other schools draws 
freshmen and sophomores from all majors and cultural backgrounds 
because of its size 400 students they also must take some 
courses with the rest of the population 
people who studied education in the 60s thought a lot about 
the potential for combining academic life with the rest of life 
said director richard meisler known in the academic community for 
his book trying freedom a case for liberating education 
pilot cofounder donald r brown now director of michigans 
center for research on learning and teaching said the 
livinglearning concept originated with monasteries and at the 
college level with oxfordcambridge and while many small schools 
operated with that theory in mind the university of michigan had 
no large public university to turn to for a model 
none of the specific details were simply lifted they were 
really invented he said adding that the schools residential 
college founded in 1967 evolved simultaneously that program 
which also survives is a fouryear program which operates as a 
full college with its own faculty 
outofclassroom contact between students and instructors can be 
a positive factor in student performance said russell edgerton 
president of the american association for higher education 
students would benefit more if tenured professors could 
participate edgerton said but the costs are just astronomical 
thats why students pay a lot more to attend small liberal arts 
colleges 
administrators say the cost of educating a pilot student is 
comparable to that for other students because the cost of 
individualized attention is made up for by the lower cost of 
graduate assistants and more efficient use of space no extra fees 
are charged for participation in the program 
edgerton said a current trend in education is federated 
learning communities in which a group of students takes three 
classes with a common theme such as poverty or hunger the three 
professors would work together on developing course material and 
would team teach 
at indiana universitys collins livinglearning center courses 
usually are designed by a professor and only one faculty member 
lives with the students said director ernest bernhardtkabisch 
john fowler director of the sewall residential academic program 
at the university of colorado said the 18yearold program 
experimented with resident graduate instructors but decided more 
resident advisers were needed the change was made not for 
academics but because students needed more supervision 
like the ann arbor program retention rates are much higher than 
in the whole university and there are fewer students on academic 
probation he said 
its not easier get that out of your mind right now said 
falesa ivory 21 a senior psychology major from chicago who says 
her pilot grades were comparable to her other marks 
the pilot program has not compiled detailed statistics on 
student performance compared to the university at large however 
cofounder brown said the schools housing department kept track of 
each units performance in areas such as academics intramural 
sports and vandalism during the 1960s 
the unit the first pilot students moved into had one of the 
lowest gradepoint averages and one of the highest vandalism rates 
after a few years pilot students were among the highest in 
academics and lowest in vandalism 
a 198184 study conducted showed that while minority students at 
michigan had higher dropout rates than other students those in the 
pilot program had an 80 percent to 95 percent retention rate the 
university at large had a 70 percent retention rate said david 
schoem a former director 
in the pilot program many of the courses may be used toward 
general education requirements students may find them more 
interesting because they deal with specific themes 
raouf mama resident director for academics teaches an english 
composition course focusing on human relationships as they appear 
in literature 
jim hartman who is pursuing a masters degree in environmental 
education teaches a course called planet management focusing on 
issues like world hunger and politics their final exam might be to 
develop a dorm program or display on a specific crisis one group 
of students discussing homelessness decided the best way to learn 
about it was to hit the streets 
hartman also the halls resident director for activities said 
for me the thing about learning is if you can participate and be 
creative have some power in your learning then you have a better 
chance of learning

the baby boy was found at the bottom of a 
motel trash bin his face was swollen his body still strangled in 
the first hours of life and dumped by three people who sped off in 
a latemodel chevy nova 
its such a waste of life said gardena police detective 
bill moreno who is trying to trace the mother by a serial number 
on the videogame box into which the infant was stuffed who 
would do something like that 
the mother who abandons her child is often unwed perhaps has 
lost a job is addicted to drugs or has mental or physical 
problems experts say baby blues postpartum depression 
also can play a part 
i was isolated i felt very alone i didnt feel there was 
anybody out there in the world that could possibly understand what 
i was going through explained gayle marcuerquiaga who left a 
newborn girl in a neighbors trash 
an estimated 20860 children were abandoned in 1986 in the 
united states ranging from babies dumped in the trash to toddlers 
left in foster homes and not reclaimed according to the american 
humane association 
this is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody keeps any 
hard figures said aha spokeswoman katie bond its hard to tell 
if abandonment is increasing she said because it represents only 
1 percent of child abuse and neglect and those reports have 
climbed 212 percent since 1976 
but alex morales of the childrens bureau of los angeles a 
private nonprofit agency which places some forsaken babies in 
foster homes said there is an increase and a change in the 
flavor of whats behind it it seems to be very related to 
substance abuse problems that the adults are having 
its an act of desperation said thomas hicklin assistant 
professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at university of 
southern california 
mrs marcuerquiaga 28 who is appealing her attempted murder 
conviction and threeyear prison term calls her sparks nev 
family typically american she was a young mother juggling work 
family children and financial ruin 
she believes abandoning her baby last april culminated a series 
of events that included her fathers death and a back injury that 
put her husband jim out of work her job as a manicurist didnt 
bring in enough to support their sons ages 8 and 4 the couple 
separated for six months and she got pregnant during a onenight 
stand yet she refused to believe she was pregnant until the child 
was born as she sat over the toilet and even then the child was 
not real 
if it were a child to me that would not have happened she 
said of the abandonment the infant was put up for adoption because 
mrs marcuerquiaga did not want her to grow up with knowledge of 
her first few hours i felt if we brought her home she would 
have to live with this and she deserves better 
in some cases children have been left where there is a 
possibility someone will rescue them such as doorsteps churches 
hospitals 
a newborn boy was found in march 1988 outside a mission viejo 
urgent care center with a bag of diapers a 20 bill and a note 
saying hi my name is brett please find me a good home 
last november a woman pinned a note to the yellow sleeper of 
her infant son and left him on the steps of a roman catholic church 
here the note in spanish said i have no job i have no money 
i am from el salvador 
in january a newborn boy dressed in a tshirt and diaper was 
left on the doorstep of a home in the upscale los angeles suburb of 
simi valley we were just thankful that we were home said 
valerie carrillo it was a shock to open up and see something so 
special on the doorstep 
the rev alberto villalobos who answered a bell at the door of 
st john of god catholic church in norwalk calif in march 1988 
to find a weekold boy said the 22yearold unwed mother was 
driven by fear nobody knew she was pregnant 
the baby had been left with the note please take care of my 
child give him a good home i cant because i dont have one 
from what i know she was a young person down on her luck who 
did what she thought was best for the child sheriffs sgt 
douglas dickinson said of the decision not to file charges the 
mother was not identified 
an abandoned child becomes a ward of the county or in some 
areas the state while authorities search for the parents the 
child is put in a foster home where it might live for up to 1 
years before it can legally be adopted 
psychologists and social workers say most abandoned children who 
are permanently adopted into good homes will not suffer any special 
problems but hicklin said some children think maybe theyre to 
blame or somethings wrong with them they must not be right or 
worthy of their mothers love 
finding parents willing to love a throwaway child is not 
difficult most waiting lines are years long for couples who want 
to adopt an infant each case of abandonment lights up switchboards 
nationwide with wouldbe parents 
people are clamoring for babies said ray lamotte 
spokeswoman for the los angeles county department of childrens 
services they can walk in and hand the baby to us no one needs 
to know their name 
all the newborns abandoned in the los angeles area in the last 
year were unclaimed by parents with older children mothers 
sometimes do return 
a woman who abandoned her 3monthold daughter at a visalia 
hospital in january saying she couldnt pay her medical bills 
later returned for the baby and was offered help by county mental 
health workers 
one of the more publicized cases is that of christina locasto 
who gave birth to a daughter alyssa july 13 on a united airlines 
jet bound from new york to san francisco an airline worker later 
found the child stuffed into a bathroom waste bin suffering from 
hypothermia and cuts on her back 
mrs locasto 24 of staten island ny pleaded innocent in 
july to one felony count of child endangerment custody of the 
child has been given to her paternal grandparents and mrs locasto 
and her husband louis who apparently was unaware of the pregnancy 
visit six hours weekly under supervision 
mrs locasto is in therapy while awaiting an april 13 
preliminary hearing said her attorney richard bennett if she 
changes her plea to guilty she will face no more than a year in 
county jail 
she doesnt want to go to jail said assistant district 
attorney steve wagstaff but were not going to agree to that 
until we find the answer to the question why did she do this 
sharon elliott survived an undetermined amount of time before 
being found christmas eve 1931 along an arizona desert highway by a 
couple changing a flat tire tucked inside a black pasteboard 
hatbox the tiny redhaired waif drew nationwide attention and 
became known as the hatbox baby 
ms elliott 57 theorizes she was born to an unwed woman 
fearful of a disapproving society or perhaps the couple who found 
her had known the mother and made up the story of finding the child 
in the desert 
she is happy to have been adopted but there is a hard edge in 
her voice when she considers throwaway kids theres so many 
places you can take a child dont just dump them like a load of 
trash

fidela pizarra thinks she might make 
enough money to start rebuilding the home she lost in a typhoon 
helen rodica no longer has to beg in the streets to feed her 
family 
their new beginnings come from marie de la soudiere a 
frenchwoman who barks orders and encoura in the 
small secondstory office of thread ofgement at them hope for economic 
advancement or thea 
they are among 40 women from impoverished squatter settlements 
who are making nightgowns being sold in boutiques in the united 
states and a half dozen other places in the world 
de la soudiere brought the women together last year 
theas goal is to provide a decent livelihood for destitute 
women who cannot qualify for government jobs or who fall through 
the cracks of state welfare and assistance programs 
it is among hundreds of cooperatives most supported by foreign 
and local charity organizations that provide jobs for thousands of 
filipinos who otherwise face lives of abject poverty 
de la soudiere who worked with international relief 
organizatioa major tax reform that is 
likely to strip away some of the benefits of buying and selling 
expensive artwork 
despite the egalitarian ideology of the swedish welfare state 
private wealth has blossomed over the last decade bringing new 
money to old and modern art big companies also boost their 
prestige by displaying the best of swedish collections in their 
corporate headquarters 
all this has created a boom in the art market and in art prices 
swedes have a lot of purchasing power right now said hans 
dyhlen director of the swedish branch of sothebys art is seen 
both as an interesting and a relatively secure investment people 
buy art as a form of security planning but buyers he said 
arent very discriminating in their taste 
dyhlen said the competition on the art market increased five 
years ago when a third big quality auction house beijers was 
established in sweden theres a lot happening on the swedish art 
scene right now a lot of young artists have exhibitions and get 
their works sold 
bukowskis auction house sold works last year worth 368 million 
kronor 613 million about four times its sales in 1983 
goran hellstrom of bukowskis information department said 
prices of high quality work have risen dramatically and he had a 
kinder view of local tastes people are more quality conscious 
now then five years ago he said 
under current tax law artwork is exempt from capital gains tax 
after five years of ownership a break that is unavailable to 
sellers of stocks or real estate 
i guess there have been just too many investments in art for 
the sake of evading taxes sven karldstedt a tax official said 
but whether or not the benefits of art ownership will be reduced in 
the tax reform is a political question 
last november a littleknown swedish real estate tycoon hans 
thulin made a splash in the us modern art world within one week 
he bought jasper johns white flag and rebus by robert 
rauschenbert for a total of 133 million a week later he paid 
nearly 2 million at a swedish auction for nils dardels dying 
dandy 
although the business magazine affarsvarlden listed thulin among 
swedens 100 wealthiest families stockholms tabloids reported 
that he declared zero wealth in his 1986 tax declaration and paid 
no income tax in 1986 or 1987 
the average worker pays about half his salary in taxes to 
underwrite social welfare benefits such as free education and 
health care 
but the high taxes also generate what swedes call tax 
planning the search for legal or illegal ways to evade taxes 
for the small investor some companies advertise shares in 
paintings which are stored away for selling after the fiveyear tax 
break takes effect said karlgustav fernlund a member of the 
governmental committee working on the tax revision 
fernlund said such companies were one reason why art investments 
have started to attract attention 
hellstrom said any tax on profits in art would primarily affect 
the quality auction houses and art dealers which keep all 
transactions on file and favor less serious dealers he also said 
a tax could scare away buyers from the national market and 
encourage them to invest abroad despite a 25 percent import tax on 
artwork brought into the country 
the broadened interest in art for whatever reason has 
benefited swedish artists in a country of 84 million 3200 
people are registered artists and stockholm has nearly 200 art 
dealers and galleries 
painters and sculptors in sweden whether they sell their work 
or not can apply for a grant of 40000 kronor 6350 from a 
governmental fund but they cannot qualify two years in a row of 
2300 applicants last year 548 received the grant

nearly five decades ago nazis seized 
valuable 200yearold amber artworks from a russian palace as 
soviet and german troops battled ferociously on the outskirts of 
leningrad 
four years later the amber room treasures vanished inside 
nazi germany in one of the worlds greatest unsolved mysteries 
and now thriller writer heinz g konsalik has retold the tale 
in the bestselling novel das bernstein zimmer the amber 
room a work that combines fact with some highly imaginative 
fiction 
since 1945 stumped soviet officials as well as private german 
treasure hunters have been looking for the collection of amber wall 
panels figures and garlands taken from the famous catherine palace 
the long search has turned up dozens of clues about the fate of 
the amber treasures from suspicions the nazis hid the collection 
inside a brewery cellar to indications the artworks went down with 
a german ship sunk by a soviet submarine in 1945 
last year an anonymous man repeatedly called east german 
officials saying he knew where the collection was but refused to 
disclose the location so far all the guesses rumors and even 
wellresearched hypotheses have led nowhere 
in his book konsalik fuses the history of the amber room 
collection with speculation about what may have happened to the 
treasures 
parts of das bernstein zimmer are wilder and more 
imaginative than most rumors about the collections ultimate fate 
and the writer himself warns not to seriously take those sections 
of the book 
in the novel a greedy american gi in occupied germany steals 
the amber room collection goes on a murder spree to keep it from 
anyone else transports it to the united states and four decades 
later blows the whole thing up while fantasizing that hes peter 
the great 
once again in his new work konsalik has found all the 
ingredients necessary for winning a broad readership espionage 
intrigue war murder and romance 
but the author says he thinks the main appeal of das berstein 
zimmer is the still unsolved question where is the treasured 
collection there is great interest in this subject because the 
amber room remains such a mystery the novel recounts the greed 
of nazi leaders who ordered that the amber room treasures be seized 
as german troops attacked leningrad in 1941 the futile soviet 
efforts to prevent the collection from being taken to germany and 
the artworks disappearance in east prussia during the chaos that 
preceded hitlers defeat 
for two centuries the beauty and splendor of the amber room 
mesmerized those privileged enough to see its treasures inside the 
renowned catherine palace in pushkin just outside modernday 
leningrad the catherine palace was the summer residence of 
russias royal family 
ironically the amber room had german origins in 1707 under 
instructions from prussian king friedrich wilhelm i german and 
danish artists created decorative panels of brilliant amber for the 
charlottenburg palace in berlin 
peter the great fell under the amber collections spell during a 
visit to berlin and friedrich wilhelm decided to give it to the 
russian czar to help secure the friendship of a valuable ally 
according to historical accounts 
the collection was loaded aboard sleds and transported in the 
winter of 171617 to petersburg which is now known as leningrad 
the panels and other amber treasures were later installed in a room 
inside the catherine palace 
in 1941 as german and soviet troops fought savagely on the 
outskirts of leningrad a special german team removed the 
collection from the catherine palace and transported it safely to 
the east prussian city of koenigsberg where it was placed in a 
museum four years later the soviets had turned the tables and 
were defeating german troops within the third reich nazi leaders 
had the amber room collection packed up and ready for transport to 
keep the artworks out of soviet hands but from that point on 
there are only traces of what happened to the treasures 
konsalik thinks the amber room collection has been lost for 
good there are many trails leading to various places but i 
dont believe it will ever be recovered 
more than 91000 hardcover copies of konsaliks das bernstein 
zimmer have been sold since the book appeared in print earlier 
this year according to his publisher hestia verlag 
his work is often ignored by west germanys highly demanding 
book critics who concede his popularity but question the literary 
quality of novels but he has written 122 works and his books have 
been translated into 26 languages he has sold an estimated 72 
million copies of his books worldwide 
with that kind of popularity konsalik has no trouble shaking 
off suggestions that he is not a serious writer 
these people are far more important to me than a dozen or so 
critics he said about those who buy his books

spring came gently this year to gallaudet 
university with no outward sign of the tumult that catapulted the 
nations only university for the deaf to international prominence 
and led to the naming of its first deaf president 
but a year later the spirit of the deaf president now 
protest lives on in newfound pride and assertiveness among the 
deaf in heightened awareness and understanding among the hearing 
the euphoria is still here the energy is still here said 
i king jordan gallaudets president the sense of purpose the 
sense of community its better than it was ever before it gets 
better all the time something fundamental has changed in the 
beliefs that deaf people have about themselves and that hearing 
people have about deaf people 
jordan won his post march 13 1988 after students joined by 
faculty staff and alumni shut down the 125yearold school for 
five days and forced the board of trustees initial choice to 
resign she was elisabeth ann zinser a hearing woman who did not 
know sign language she was gone within a week 
lofty pronouncements emanated by the dozens from protesters 
riding the exhilarating crest of victory last spring god made 
the world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days 
deaf chemistry professor charles giansanti said then nothing will 
ever be the same said countless others 
visionaries or fools the developments of the past year point to 
the former 
enrollment at the 2400student university is up 52 percent 
congress which provides most of the gallaudet budget boosted its 
contribution 62 percent the two congressmen on the gallaudet 
board are learning to sign the new deaf chairman of the board 
developed a plan to recruit deaf board members jordan in constant 
demand to speak has become an inspirational symbol revered by deaf 
people all over the country 
perhaps the most fundamental change is a shift in attitude 
people have developed a lot more confidence in themselves 
said greg hlibok student body president and part of the intense 
quartet that led the insurgency their pride has increased their 
view of the future they look forward to much more than people did 
five years ago theres a wider range of perspective 
off campus the story is similar more people are aware of 
deafness hlibok said through an interpreter before they 
looked at us as a problem today they look at us as people with a 
problem deafness thats all 
the board chairman ibm executive philip bravin said 
gallaudets week in the limelight was enough to propel much of the 
private sector from discomfort to openness toward the deaf 
referring to his and jordans speaking engagements around the 
country bravin who also won his job as a result of the 
insurgency said that countless times we have run into people 
saying that their job or working conditions changed for the better 
overnight as a result of dpn the deaf president now movement 
thats a very positive thing to hear its not limited to a few 
corporations but is very global 
again and again one is told of students landing jobs they were 
never able to get before whether because of their own insecurity 
or an employers intolerance 
one girl told that a pizza delivery job had been filled passed 
by the store next day and saw the help wanted sign again in the 
window she confronted the supervisor and got the job she felt 
that empowerment that a year ago she might not have felt said 
jordan 
since the protest students have a general attitude of i can 
win i can succeed i can achieve what i want said career 
center director sue pressman at the same time she said employers 
have become more receptive to hiring deaf graduates and many more 
companies are participating in gallaudet career fairs 
you do still find a lot of attitudinal barriers she said 
but the deaf protest allowed us to go in and work with those 
people employers are looking to gallaudet for the answers theyre 
willing to hire deaf people they want us to help them theyre 
looking to us to show them the way 
the same heightened interest is evident in gallaudets 
internship program which has expanded rapidly since the protest 
the one big thing is that we have name recognition now we 
never had that before with private companies and its an important 
entree said program director anne nissen 
nissen said she used to have to give a long explanation of 
gallaudet often with little to show for it 
people were always courteous because youre not rude to 
people who are explaining a disability but they didnt follow 
up she said now theres a lot of curiosity and eagerness to 
be attached to a famous place we have milked that 
new participants in the internship program include sears 
roebuck and co saks fifth avenue northern telecom mci 
communications corp atampt bell laboratories and several big eight 
accounting firms students are doing more challenging work nissen 
said and are more likely to complain promptly if a job turns out 
to be busywork 
students say theyre being treated better not only on the job 
but in other aspects of daily life as well when i used to go to 
a restaurant and ask for paper and pen to order some food people 
tended to have a negative attitude said hlibok now theres a 
willingness theyre eager to help 
the other big change the four protest leaders said through an 
interpreter is that the nations deaf community no longer sits on 
its hands when its interests are at stake this was our first 
movement said jerry covell deaf people now feel that were 
entitled to our opinion 
tim rarus recalled his doubts in organizing a capitol hill rally 
to demand telecommunications devices for the deaf on phones at 
federal agencies i thought deaf people arent going to show 
up he said but they did we got a good crowd 
hlibok said another successful rally was held in new york to 
protest threatened budget cuts for state schools for the deaf 
theres an unwritten rule since the protest at gallaudet 
when something happens thats a crisis in the deaf community 
deaf people are going to act he said 
that didnt happen before the protest we asked ourselves 
should we or shouldnt we but now if somethings wrong were 
going to speak out right away 
hlibok rarus covell and bridgetta bourne all said they plan to 
attend law school in the next few years and serve the deaf or 
disabled community in some fashion they are acutely conscious of 
their legacy not only to the school but to the larger deaf 
community as well 
we made history covell said simply now small deaf 
children will look to that and will learn something from it we 
were oppressed and finally we said enough they will do better 
than we did theyll continue what we havent finished

ordinary people extraordinary paintings 
call thomas hart benton a failed artist as one critic does 
quibble over whether regionalism was a legitimate movement in 
american art history accuse him of betraying himself by turning 
away from fashionable modernism to paint realistically 
but because his paintings about everyday people appeal to 
everyday people does not mean they are unsophisticated says henry 
adams curator of american art at the nelsonatkins museum of art 
the paintings his murals especially are bold colorful and 
dramatic they have as adams says the tendency to pop off the 
wall 
april 15 marks the 100th anniversary of bentons birth were he 
still alive the artist could celebrate with his fans at kellys a 
popular saloon and the kind of place where benton would be pleased 
to have his pictures hang an afternoon bourbon party is held each 
sunday in his honor 
or he could attend the opening of the first major exhibition of 
his work since his death the nelsonatkins museum of art will 
display 90 of his paintings beginning april 16 
benton spent much of his life among the intellectual and 
creative in the worlds most exciting cities his home was once a 
gathering place for such luminaries as the poet carl sandburg and 
folk singers burl ives and pete seeger a place where bourbon oiled 
conversation and rita benton set a memorable table 
he was happiest though trudging across the south and the 
southwest sketching farmhands saloon girls and factory workers 
i like people and primarily i paint for them the artist 
said at the height of his acclaim in 1936 if they can see 
something in these paintings out of their own lives i dont care 
what they think or know about art 
the exhibition the first traveling show staged by the nelson 
will close june 18 in kansas city and open aug 4 at the detroit 
institute of arts nov 17 at the whitney museum of american art in 
new york and april 29 1990 at the los angeles county museum of 
art 
by necessity the shows organizers ignored the irony of putting 
bentons work in a museum museums the artist once said are 
graveyards generally run by a pretty boy with delicate wrists and 
a swing in his gait 
that 1941 diatribe to reporters in new york which got worse 
also included some thinly veiled criticisms of figures at the 
nelson it made all the papers and benton was fired from his 
teaching job at the kansas city art institute and by 1948 he was 
excluded from a list of the 10 best american painters drawn up by 
life magazine 
you are constantly trying to figure out whether he was a fool 
or a genius the answer is of course he was both says adams 
whose benton biography will be published as the exhibition opens 
benton loved bourbon and books rita his harmonica and family 
musicales bourbon ordinary ozarks folk telling stories stirring 
up things locomotives and bourbon but most of all he loved to 
paint 
paint he did until the day he died every day in the studio out 
back usually 10 hours a day 
rita found him dead of a heart attack in front of his last 
mural it was for the country music hall of fame in nashville which 
had upset him because he had not quite got the wabash cannonball 
right he was 85 and had just finished the work that afternoon 
jan 18 1975 his wife died three months later she couldnt live 
without him their daughter jessie said 
he got up every morning excited about life and eager to go to 
work adams said this was someone always very alive always 
very excited about the next project there was an intensity in the 
way this man lived they had a way of making things that seem 
ordinary to us the moon or a dead tree stump seem like something 
special 
time magazine put him on the cover dec 24 1934 calling him 
one of the leaders in a new movement in american art called 
regionalism 
benton accepted the label in some ways it was a gimmick adams 
says and declared himself free of modernist and abstract 
directions artists in new york were taking that his detrators 
say was bad 
benton showed promise in the 1920s when he experimented with 
abstraction but betrayed himself by abandoning it said critics 
clement greenberg and hilton kramer 
the person whom we are celebrating here today in my view was 
a failed artist said kramer editor of the new criterion in new 
york 
kramer said that art should be judged for its aesthetic 
qualities not its cultural themes benton fails when judged 
aesthetically he said 
now in the 1980s we are celebrating the second coming of 
thomas hart benton kramer said he is being seen as a very 
model of success but in my view this wont succeed i find it 
mostly myth that he was a great american artist who somehow gave 
american art its quintessential essense 
the tumult of the times in which he lived influenced bentons 
painting a time of great political social and economic change 
yielded themes of growing industry of injustice and of the 
agrarian rural life that was being left behind 
criticism of bentons painting then often had to do with his 
subjects he was at times labeled a fascist and a communist a 
racist and antisemitic however he was most likely a new deal 
liberal democrat according to adams 
his role as a painter was to make the invisible visible there 
is always a message to what benton is doing usually an ambiguous 
one he didnt want people to look at a painting and come away 
feeling smug because they knew what he meant adams says 
bentons greatest works were murals painted for the states of 
indiana and missouri the indiana mural was commissioned for the 
worlds fair in 1933 and now hangs at indiana university the 
missouri mural finished in 1936 is in the house lounge in the 
capitol at jefferson city 
shortly before he died benton said if i have any right to 
make judgments i would say that the missouri mural was my best 
work 
a social history of missouri took 18 months to plan and six 
months to paint 
benton who stood only 5foot2 was quick with his fists as a 
boy in roughandtumble neosho mo and quick with his wits later 
in life selftaught mostly in things other than art he had a 
renaissance range of interests adams said 
i have run into my fathers critics all my life said jessie 
benton but also ive run into people who adore the paintings in 
a mystical way even more then i do 
i think people should remember him as a man who put life into 
art and art into life

the bad old days before abortion was 
legalized were not so bad say antiabortion advocates who contend 
womens lives would not be imperiled if abortion should be outlawed 
once again 
they argue that better antibiotics intensive care units and 
surgical techniques were already halting the serious bleeding 
infections and other complications of illegal abortions before the 
us supreme court overturned state bans on abortions in 1973 
legalization of abortion in the united states apparently did 
not save a single womans life asserted dr john willke of 
cincinnati president of the national right to life committee 
he contends that before 1973 there were not many illegal 
abortions and says that very few women died from abortions 
federal health officials agree that statistics show the death 
rate from complications of illegal abortions was declining before 
1973 
but supporters of womens right to abortion dispute that a 
renewed ban on abortions would not have serious health 
consequences they note there are no statistics on the number of 
women who suffered nonfatal health problems from illegal abortions 
the debate over abortion is intensifying as the supreme court 
prepares to hear arguments april 26 over missouri regulations that 
restrict the availability of abortions both sides expect the court 
to use the case to reexamine the landmark roe vs wade decision 
that legalized abortions in 1973 
opponents of roewade including the bush administration are 
asking the court to declare there is no constitutional right to 
abortion and return to the states the power to restrict or outlaw 
abortions 
in a telephone interview willke said nobody has the slightest 
idea how many illegal abortions took place before 1973 
however he said the number of abortionrelated deaths was more 
concrete because a perforated uterus which is evident on 
autopsy a massive infection a hemorrhage make it pretty 
obvious what has happened 
willke said that in the 1950s an average of 250 women a year 
were reported to have died in the united states due to illegal 
abortions but by 1966 while abortion was still illegal 
everywhere the annual number of reported deaths had dropped to 128 
in 1972 the year before roewade 5 million pregnancies and 39 
abortionrelated deaths were reported 
after 1973 when the ban ended in all states illegal abortion 
presumably disappeared willke said if in fact the 
elimination of illegal abortion eliminated back alleys there 
should have been a perceptible drop in the number of women dying 
that didnt happen the line didnt even blip from 1967 to 1973 and 
1974 it just kept going down at the same slow rate there was 
no evidence of a decline in mortality from legalization 
dr hami atrash acting chief of pregnancy epidemiology at the 
federal centers for disease control said the trend has been 
going down since 1940 just like for any other cause of death 
the cdc did not begin keeping thorough records on 
abortionrelated deaths until 1972 it has two sets of slightly 
inconsistent figures covering some years before 1972 that 
essentially back up the antiabortion groups figures 
sandy smith a spokeswoman for the cdcs national center for 
health statistics said it was possible some doctors falsified 
death certificates to protect victims of illegal abortions 
theres no way to know said atrash even today some 
people say women die of abortions and theyre not reported 
the cdc also does not have figures on how many women suffered 
severe bleeding infections hysterectomies and other complications 
from abortions but survived 
david andrews acting president of the planned parenthood 
federation of america said statistics from the time are not 
terribly reliable because it was an illegal procedure and nobody 
kept count 
but people who lived through that period know that women were 
dying women were maimed many women lost their fertility due to 
botched abortions andrews said 
willke predicted that if abortion should become illegal again 
about 100000 women a year would have the procedure anyway 
an estimated 15 million abortions have been performed annually 
since 1973 
i do know that this time around illegal abortions will be 
considerably safer than they were willke said people who do 
them have had a great deal of experience 
andrews disagreed 
doctors who are capable of providing the service would not 
risk their professional careers he said what you would get 
would be inadequately trained backalley practitioners probably 
people who are not doctors who simply have as their goal the 
exploitation of women 
willke says the best ways to address the problem of unwanted 
pregnancies would be to grant tax incentives for adoption and place 
nonwhite children with white adoptive parents 
he contends a significant percentage of all abortions are 
birth control abortions 
people know they have this backstop so they take chances he 
said when you cant get abortions youre more careful or 
you dont do it have sex

women seeking alternatives to back alley 
abortions found a scattering of oases even before the us supreme 
court legalized abortions 16 years ago 
most of the attention focused on new york which quickly became 
a mecca for women who wanted to end their pregnancies after the 
legislature erased a ban on abortions in 1970 
new york wasnt the first state to ease abortion restrictions 
but it was the only one that did not limit abortions to state 
residents and it was one of only three that did not require the 
consent of a parent or spouse 
women seeking abortions began flooding into the state 
the first legal abortion in the state was performed july 1 
1970 and by the time the supreme court made abortions legal 
nationwide on jan 22 1973 nearly 400000 women had traveled to 
new york to terminate pregnancies 
they found clean facilities counseling and a matteroffact 
candor that contrasted sharply with the shadowy world of illegal 
abortions 
abortion clinic staff members some sporting pink carnations in 
their lapels for easy recognition met flights at airports and 
escorted patients into vans or limousines 
the alan guttmacher institute says legal abortions were 
performed for 48000 women from other states in 1970 155000 in 
1971 172000 in 1972 and 84000 in 1973 new york residents had 
41000 abortions in 1970 101000 in 1971 110000 in 1972 and 
120000 in 1973 
the rush tapered off after the supreme courts roe vs wade 
decision but supporters of the right to an abortion fear the 
current court may reconsider that ruling when it hears arguments in 
a case involving missouri abortion rules april 26 
about 80 clinics and hospitals were licensed to perform 
abortions in new york city each year they aborted as many 
pregnancies as there were live births in the city said jean 
pakter who was director of the health departments bureau of 
maternity services and family planning 
polly rothstein director and cofounder of the westchester 
coalition for legalized abortion recalled limousines from posh 
private clinics meeting patients at airports and bringing them to 
abortion clinics in new york for no questions asked safe 
abortions 
a visit to one such clinic as an observer in 1972 was an 
eyeopener for me she said 
it was a blessing just a blessing for people to have it done 
by a doctor in a sterile clinic breaking the law the sneaking 
around the anxiety attached to it will i get it will i get 
it was removed she said 
we were seeing women coming from all over the country said 
libby antarsh then director of the eastern womens center many 
of the women who came really there were a lot of young girls 
had never been to new york some had never flown or been out of 
their small towns they were terrified 
the waiting room was enormous but on saturdays not an inch of 
floor space was visible she said the patients and visitors 
mostly jeaned smoking young scared blond from states like 
ohio were everywhere 
the center provided abortions seven days a week with a sliding 
fee scale that topped at 150 and ran a free van service to and 
from laguardia airport 
there was a counselor on board as well as a driver we would 
meet the flights try to calm them down talk to them about what 
they might expect for the day said ms antarsh you can 
imagine the tension and feelings of those young women 
the patients went home the same day she said it was easier 
for young women to have an unexplained absence for just a day on 
a saturday they could fly in the morning come home at night and 
no one would know about it 
new york city designated planned parenthoods family planning 
hotline as an official abortion information number it was posted 
on bulletin boards of college campuses and social work agencies 
around the country 
we sat down at these phones and they never stopped ringing 
said marcia lawrence director of communications for planned 
parenthood of new york city there was never a point during the 
day when all five buttons were not lit they were calling from 
everywhere every state in the union 
we always tried to give the woman the strength to truly see 
clearly what it was she honestly wanted to do that was our job as 
we saw it not to push her in either direction she said 
but when someone has hitchhiked from nebraska to new york you 
cannot really say are you sure you really want this abortion 
she has clearly indicated that she wants it 
teenagers were told to ask a trusted adult to call planned 
parenthood help them arrange transportation and ensure adequate 
medical followup 
the flood lasted into the first few months of 1973 until other 
states responded fully to the supreme courts ruling 
it was said ms lawrence of planned parenthood as though 
heaven had opened up and said you have a second chance to make 
everything right and get it back to where it was before it 
made an enormous difference not to be made to feel like a criminal 
when they were trying to make a moral choice in the best fullest 
sense

for mayor marion barry jr the questions these days are the 
same whether hes talking to white businessmen or black reporters 
what is he doing about the murders and does he count drug dealers 
among his friends 
as barry the first militant black civil rights leader to be 
elected mayor of a major american city struggles to deal with the 
crisis in washington an undercurrent of rumors about his own 
alleged drug use undercut his credibility 
while speaking at the capitol press club barry faced the same 
kind of questions from the groups mostlyblack press corps that he 
complains the white media concentrate on 
mr mayor if you had it to do over again what mistakes would 
you acknowledge asked ethel payne who has worked for 30 years 
as a political columnist for the weekly washington afroamerican 
after refusing to admit having made any errors barry asked 
payne for her opinion of him 
i think you have a whole pile of stuff to contend with 
barry smiled uneasily an uncomfortable silence settled over the 
room 
barry is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug 
suspect charles lewis last december city police abruptly called 
off an attempted undercover drug buy from lewis a former city 
employee barry was in lewis hotel room at the time and had been 
there often subsequently lewis was arrested in the virgin islands 
on charges he attempted to sell crack cocaine to undercover fbi 
agents 
barry has vehemently denied ever using drugs he said he never 
saw lewis use drugs 
the media is mixing up two scandals the drug problem and all 
these things about me he told the capitol press club 
earlier a weary barry tried to lecture on drugs at a school in 
the shaw neighborhood one of washingtons most depressed

the view of the police chief washington dc is a safe city 
it has a lower crime rate than 16 cities of comparable size 
those murders says chief maurice turner referring to the 
record number of homicides in washington are occurring between 
the people who use drugs who buy drugs who sell drugs who abuse 
drugs 
he made those comments during a taping for public television 
station weta deluged with press questions later turner conceded 
that despite 4300 arrests last year his department has been 
unable to curb drugrelated violence and may have to wait out the 
bloody turf wars 
i dont know what the hell were going to do he exclaimed 
miami went through this experience detroit went through this 
experience were no different than any other community said 
turner 
but police and criminologists in those cities say the districts 
drug battles are far deadlier 
eventually the turf will be divided predicted turner 
they the prevailing dealers will go out and sell their drugs 
people will pay their drug bills on time and were not going to 
have all of these shootings we have now 
in the meantime he said the community must work together to 
reinforce strong values in young people 
school board member calvin lockridge and local magazine 
publisher bill regardie have charged that mayor barry has used 
drugs about that turner says this ive never asked the mayor 
has he used drugs ive never had any evidence that the mayor uses 
drugs if i ever saw the mayor with drugs he would be arrested

the government is close to indicting drexel 
burnham lambert inc bond financier michael milken and several 
other employees of the investment firm on securities fraud charges 
sources say 
prosecutors have told lawyers for milken and others their 
clients could be indicted this week before civil fraud charges 
against the investment firm are settled the sources said tuesday 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the longawaited criminal indictment of the highyield or 
junk bond wizard would mark a major change of the governments 
strategy in its more than twoyear investigation of the wall street 
giant 
defense attorneys had expected the indictment to follow a 
settlement between drexel and the securities and exchange 
commission of civil fraud charges including insider trading 
brought last year the complaint names drexel milken his brother 
lowell two other drexel employees and industrialist victor posner 
and his son steven 
but with negotiations stalled drexel balking at 
governmentordered sanctions and the milkens mounting legal 
challenges to the firms proposed settlement the manhattan us 
attorneys office reportedly has decided to proceed with the case 
sources close to the situation said lawyers were told that the 
milkens and at least two other drexel employees would be indicted 
this week the sources cautioned that prosecutors had made similar 
statements in the past about pending indictments that never 
materialized 
a number of the attorneys have been told that its going to be 
this week said an attorney for one of the targets 
the sources said the government continues to call witnesses 
before a federal grand jury investigating drexels activities 
milken last year received a target letter from the government 
indicating he would be indicted the charges are expected to 
parallel the 184page sec complaint which detailed 21 alleged 
fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986 
many of the charges detail alleged wrongdoing between milken and 
ivan boesky the nowjailed financier who paid 100 million to 
settle insider trading charges and tipped off prosecutors to other 
alleged fraud deals 
the sec settlement is a crucial precondition to a criminal plea 
bargain in which drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay 
the government 650 million drexel agreed to the pact in december 
to avoid racketeering charges that could have crippled the firm 
assistant us attorney bruce baird who heads the offices 
securities fraud division declined to comment on the milken case 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the company would not discuss 
negotiations in progress a public relations firm hired by milken 
declined to comment 
once milken is indicted the government would have 70 days to 
bring its case to trial unless a judge grants a delay or attorneys 
file motions further stalling the case 
one attorney said the government has indicated it would bring a 
second wave of superceding indictments contending that a first set 
of charges would be used as a pressure tactic to induce milken and 
other defendants and witnesses to negotiate 
an indictment also would shift focus from the sec negotiations 
in which drexel has accused the government of requesting unfairly 
stringent measures against the firm and milken 
negotiations reportedly stalled earlier this month when drexel 
chief executive frederick h joseph balked at a government demand 
to fire milken before the settlement is completed 
drexel already has agreed to fire milken and withhold his 
multimilliondollar 1988 pay as part of the criminal settlement 
milken is challenging the provision in us district court in 
manhattan saying it violates his rights

as the paralyzing strike against eastern 
airlines dragged through its fourth week and directors of its 
parent texas air corp prepared to meet again today there was 
speculation that easterns future could be decided imminently 
the board of directors of trans world airlines inc meanwhile 
met tuesday amid mounting expectations that its owner and chairman 
carl c icahn could be poised to put a longawaited bid for 
eastern on the table 
and there were indications that another group led by outgoing 
baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth was outlining proposals 
to buy miamibased eastern which has been in bankruptcy protection 
from creditors since march 9 
the ueberroth offer to be financed by drexel burnham lambert 
inc would be for 512 million and would give the eastern unions a 
30 percent equity stake in the airline in exchange for wage 
concessions the new york times reported in todays editions 
ueberroth has declined comment 
icahn and his associates were unavailable for comment on the twa 
board meeting late tuesday and texas air refused even to 
acknowledge that its board was gathering but there was speculation 
that the texas air directors could decide to remove chairman frank 
lorenzo who has been under siege from easterns unions or to take 
texas air private 
observers also speculated that minneapolis banker carl r 
pohlad a texas air director could join a bid by ueberroth 
pohlad who owns baseballs minnesota twins reportedly brought 
ueberroth in to negotiate the purchase of eastern pohlad owns 12 
percent of jet capital corp texas airs holding company lorenzo 
owns 487 percent of jet capital 
in miami meanwhile eastern previewed its first poststrike 
training class for pilots tuesday the sixweek course began monday 
with fewer students than the airline projected 
they had more or less hinted around that they were going to 
have 50 pilots but in reality only 35 people showed up air line 
pilots association spokesman hank weber said in miami thats a 
drop in the bucket 
also tuesday unionized workers at four new york cityarea 
commuter railroads asked a federal appeals court to overturn a ban 
against their striking in sympathy with eastern employees the 
court did not act immediately 
an offer from ueberroth for 300 million to 500 million may be 
presented to the texas air board in the next few days airline 
industry and baseball sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity ueberroths term as baseball commissioner ends saturday 
the board was to hold regularly scheduled meetings tuesday and 
today said a source close to the company but other sources said 
substantive discussions probably wouldnt begin until today 
texas air spokesman art kent in houston said the company 
wouldnt comment on whether a board meeting was being held 
indications of ueberroths interest came as takeover specialist 
icahn was reportedly resuming talks with easterns unions about a 
possible takeover 
icahn has publicly expressed interest and has been supported by 
easterns unions 
icahn was meeting again with union officials to discuss a 
possible takeover and hopes to use union concessions to persuade 
easterns creditors to let him take control said brian freeman an 
investment banker with close ties to the machinists union 
us bankruptcy trustee harold jones administering easterns 
chapter 11 reorganization in new york said tuesday he was 
continuing to interview about a dozen candidates for eastern 
bankruptcy examiner he said he hoped to recommend a candidate to 
us bankruptcy court judge burton lifland by late this week or 
early next 
jones declined to name the candidates under consideration 
he called ueberroth an interesting individual who has public 
stature hes an interesting force to bring into the mixture 
jones said noting that any proposed sale of eastern would have to 
be approved by the bankruptcy court

the parent company of northwest airlines says 
its board of directors has adopted a poison pill antitakeover 
defense to thwart a possible takeover attempt by an undiclosed 
investment group 
nwa inc stock soared tuesday to a price near its 52week high 
after company officials revealed the proposal 
the company said the investment group which holds a 49 percent 
stake in nwa recently notified northwest of its interest in 
exploring the possibility of a negotiated leveraged acquisition 
but it said the companys board of directors has determined 
that the interests of the company its employees customers and 
shareholders will be best served by maintaining the company as an 
independent entity and has no intention of pursuing the indication 
of interest from the investment group nwa spokesman kevin whalen 
said he could not comment beyond the companys statement 
trading of nwa stock was temporarily halted on the new york 
stock exchange immediately after the announcement was made when 
trading resumed the price jumped from 6075 a share to 6950 in 
heavy trading and closed tuesday at 7025 up 962 near its 
52week high of 7287 
despite wall streets enthusiasm analysts reacted cautiously 
noting that a formal offer for the nations fifthlargest airline 
had not yet been announced 
i hate to be skeptical but ive seen too many groups 
indicate some special interest and then they dump their shares 
said louis marckesano an airline stock analyst for janney 
montgomery scott of philadelphia if the group is legitimate and 
they have a legitimate offer in mind they should come in with a 
tender offer 
kurt rivard a securities analyst for dain bosworth inc of 
minneapolis said there is less than a 5050 chance this company 
will be acquired 
but that doesnt mean someone wont try to make a run at 
them he added 
a leveraged buyout would leave the company with too much debt 
and impair the airlines ability to keep its fleet modern rivard 
said growing government resistance to consolidation of the airline 
industry reduces the chances of a successful buyout bid from a 
competitor of northwest he added 
whalen said he could not comment on whether the investment group 
has made a formal offer for a friendly takeover of the airline 
northwest would not reveal the identity of the investment group 
the groups identity would be made public under securities and 
exchange commission rules if it obtains 5 percent or more of 
northwests stock 
the price of nwa stock like the stock of other airline 
companies has been volatile in recent months amid takeover 
speculation several companies and individuals have been rumored as 
possible suitors for northwest including carl icahn donald trump 
and american airlines 
jim halvorson a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
said tuesday that the union had not been told the identity of the 
investment group 
we have no notion at all he said 
guy cook chairman of the machinists local 143 which represents 
nearly twothirds of northwests 35000 employees said that union 
would do whatever possible to prevent the airline from being taken 
over by someone who would break it up and sell it off 
mondays action by northwests board of directors sets up an 
antitakeover defense that would make northwest less attractive to 
a hostile suitor intending to break up the company said bob 
gibbons a company spokesman 
under the poison pill plan shareholders will have the 
chance to buy one onehundredth of a share of a new series of 
preferred stock for 225 when a person or group acquires 15 percent 
of common stock or announces a tender offer that would result in 
ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power 
the initial takeover price for a hostile suitor wouldnt 
increase because of the new stock but the acquiring person or 
group would not be able to reap benefits from the sale of assets 
following the takeover gibbons said under the poison pill 
the new owners would have to distribute income from the sale of 
assets to holders of the preferred stock gibbons said he said 
many other american companies have similar antitakeover defenses 
this is a plan designed to ensure that our constituents are 
best served by any offer that we may get whalen said 
nwa reported 1988 record earnings of 1351 million or 463 a 
share up 311 percent from 103 million or 359 a share in 
1987 in august 1986 northwest acquired rival republic airlines 
for 884 million

a federal appeals court reserved ruling on a 
request by unionized workers at four metropolitan area commuter 
railroads to overturn a ban against their striking in sympathy with 
eastern airlines employees 
lawyers for the railroads argued tuesday before the threemember 
panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals that the railway 
labor act requires the railroad employees to stay on the job until 
they go through a series of mediation steps 
until the 2nd circuit decides otherwise us district judge 
robert patterson jrs injunctions against sympathy strikes remain 
in force 
at issue is whether unionized workers at the long island rail 
road nj transit metronorth commuter railroad and amtrak may 
honor picket lines set up by machinists who struck eastern on march 
4 
both the unions and the railroads agree that if all or most 
union workers honored the machinists picket lines the four 
railroads would have to shut down throwing transportation 
facilities into chaos for more than 400000 daily commuters in the 
new york metropolitan area 
on march 20 patterson barred the railroad unions from honoring 
the picket lines and ordered union officials to tell their members 
to go to work if any picket lines went up at railroad facilities 
we have been stripped of the most fundamental right that labor 
has to withdraw its services and to call upon other workers to 
withdraw their services joseph guerrieri jr lawyer for the 
unions told the appeals panel 
he claimed that because the railroad workers have no dispute 
with their own employers they would not have to go through the 
numerous steps required by the railway labor act before walking off 
the job in a sympathy strike 
but bernard plum lawyer for the lirr and metronorth said the 
railway labor act encompassed all disputes and to claim workers 
could strike if they said there was no dispute defies logic

debtridden fruehauf corp is selling its truck 
trailer business but the familiar name still will be on the road 
the buyer says 
we plan to continue in the trailer business we plan to 
continue the fruehauf name said marvin rosenberg secretary of 
green bay wisbased terex corp said tuesday 
detroitbased fruehauf said it will sell its trailer operation 
two shipping dry docks in florida and one in maryland and its 80 
percent interest in cemco a maker of ship loading cranes to a 
terex subsidiary for 2325 million 
the subsidiary frh acquisition will pay 1694 million in cash 
and assume about 631 million in longterm debt in a transaction 
expected to be closed may 15 fruehauf said 
fruehauf still battling debt from a 1986 leveraged buyout also 
will be entertaining offers for its major remaining business 
kelseyhayes co a maker of aluminum wheels antilock braking 
systems and other auto components fruehauf spokesman david a 
hladik said 
anthony g viscogliosi a securities analyst at roney amp co in 
detroit said kelseyhayes will be an attractive acquisition target 
suitors could include german japanese or other foreign 
companies that want a foothold in the us automobile equipment 
market and currently enjoy a currencyexchange advantage 
viscogliosi said 
rosenberg declined to comment on what changes terex plans for 
fruehauf employees and plants 
elsewhere efficiency has ruled when the maker of heavyduty 
offroad earthmoving equipment has acquired troubled companies and 
brought them to profitability he said 
we have focused on manufacturing efficiencies looking at 
their strengths where their profits lie and making sure they are 
not overburdened with large overcapacity he said 
other terex units such as northwest engineering co in green 
bay unit rig inc in tulsa okla and koehring cranes and 
excavators inc in iowa were in financial trouble when acquired 
rosenberg said they are all now profitable 
viscogliosi said shocks and adjustments are likely but predicted 
a favorable outcome 
i would think it would be a plus in terms of morale for the 
employees theyre finally going to get out from under he said 
fruehauf had been reviewing several acquisition proposals 
including one from varity corp a toronto farm equipment maker 
that used to be called masseyferguson that was withdrawn feb 27 
hladik said 
negotiations between terex and fruehauf intensified in the past 
week and were concluded monday night rosenberg said 
fruehauf has sold off divisions and recently proposed a 
recapitalization plan in the wake of the 1986 leveraged buyout that 
created more than 1 billion in debt 
fruehauf managers arranged the buyout with the financial help of 
merrill lynch amp co which obtained a 31 percent voting interest 
to avoid a takeover bid by new york investor asher edelman edelman 
sold his fruehauf stock at a profit and also received a 21 million 
payment from the company 
fruehauf which employs about 15800 people reported losses of 
415 million on revenue of 196 billion in 1987 and losses of 
565 million on revenue of 209 billion in 1988

makers of apple sauces and juices presented 
test results today showing the products to be virtually free of 
alar a chemical that environmentalists say heightens the risk of 
cancer in children 
the processed apple institute which represents most of the 
producers of apple sauces and juices said today tests covering 
4623 samples and a crosssection of brand names revealed only 
eight cases in which detectable levels of alar were found in the 
product 
larry davenport executive director of the atlantabased trade 
association said a detectable level meant a trace of at least 1 
part per million in the sample or 20 times below the tolerance 
level established by the environmental protection agency 
were talking about truly insignificant levels here 
davenport said tuesday in a telephone interview 
there has been widespread concern reported among parents in 
recent weeks over the health effects of chemicals used on apples 
a report by the natural resources defense council a private 
environmental group concluded last month that children are 
especially at risk from such chemicals because they eat a much 
larger volume of apples and other fruits and vegetables compared to 
their weight than do adults 
new york agriculture commissioner richard mcguire whose state 
ranks second behind washington in apple production today termed 
apples totally safe with alar found on only about 20 percent 
and in those cases well below levels that cause concern 
the issue is larger than alar mcguire said on cbs this 
morning let me say that the concern of agriculture in general 
is the removal of many of the other pesticides many of the other 
chemicals that we use in agriculture which makes it possible to 
feed the poor people of the world 
asked whether growers can by without alar mcguire said they 
certainly can and if across the country they do theyll have 
poorer quality apples a short supply in the late winter and spring 
months until the next season comes around 
but jay feldman of the national coalition against the misuse of 
chemicals contended on the cbs broadcast that alar is 
dangerous especially in combination with many other chemicals 
used on foods 
were in a sense assaulting an american through his or her 
daily diet when we sit down at the dinner table he said 
alar technically known as daminozide was singled out by the 
nrdc study although industry and government officials have said 
only from 5 percent to 10 percent of apples are sprayed with the 
chemical alar regulates growth and increases shelf life 
daminozide has been found to cause cancer in test animals and 
the epa has said it intends to ban its use but the regulatory 
process could take several years 
davenport said that the test results assembled by the institute 
were from tests conducted on apple sauce and juice from 1987 to the 
present in four states new york oregon massachusetts and 
washington by regulatory agencies independent testing 
laboratories and processors 
of the 4623 samples eight had traces of alar of at least 1 
part per million with the highest residue being 13 parts per 
million said davenport he said the samples represents brands 
across the board including all the major brands such as mott 
seneca and tree top 
this study confirms that the industry has successfully 
screened alar from its products said hugh ewart chairman of the 
processor groups technical committee 
most apple processors began putting growers on notice in 1986 
that they did not want apples that had been treated with alar but 
davenport said traces of the chemical continue to be found because 
the chemical stays in the trees

trans world airlines has announced plans to 
update and expand its fleet with the purchase of up to 40 airbus 
industrie jetliners in a deal worth more than 36 billion the 
latest in a series of big aircraft purchases by us airlines 
twa the nations eighthlargest air carrier said tuesday it 
had placed firm orders for twenty a330300 widebody aircraft with 
options to purchase 20 more of the twinengine planes 
the two companies said in a statement twa could convert up to 
half the ordered planes and half the optioned jets to a340s 
airbus fourengine longrange widebody aircraft 
twa had been expected to announce an order since last october 
when it said it would lease or buy 60 new narrowbodied aircraft 
the airlines chairman carl icahn said tuesday the company also 
plans to buy narrowbodied planes in the future 
business has been booming recently for domestic and foreign 
aircraft manufacturers over the past two months american airlines 
announced up to 14 billion in aircraft purchases planned through 
1994 including planes by us companies boeing co and 
mcdonnelldouglas corp and the dutch manufacturer fokker 
in january braniff inc said it would buy up to 100 airbus 320 
jets in a deal that could reach 35 billion 
icahn said in an interview that twas new planes would be used 
to expand its fleet and replace older aircraft icahn said the 
carriers planes have an average age of 125 years 
twas unions have complained in recent years about its aging 
planes contending that icahn had agreed to upgrade the fleet in 
acquiring the airline in 1986 
but icahn denied tuesday that the airbus purchase resulted from 
any union pressure to revitalize the twa fleet 
airbus industrie said it expected to begin delivering the a330s 
to twa in late 1994 or early 1995 
twa said it would use the planes which seat 301 passengers 
each on major north american and transatlantic routes 
airbus industrie owned by a european consortium is a major 
competitor of boeing and mcdonnelldouglas 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman craig martin said his 
company had competed for the twa order with its 767 widebody 
twinjet plane 
in the past twa has been a good boeing customer buying the 
companys 727s 747s and 767s in its fleet it currently has no 
boeing planes on order 
william whitlow who follows boeing for the investment firm dain 
bosworth co in seattle said i suspect that airbus maybe had 
some fairly attractive terms in terms of price and financing 
boeings not going to win them all he said referring to 
boeing announcements so far this year of orders for 102 aircraft 
worth more than 82 billion on top of last years record orders 
for 636 jets worth 297 billion 
phil friedman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc said 
he doubted boeings backlog of orders was a factor in the twa 
purchase 
they would have been able to get 767s by 1994 when the 
a330s are scheduled to be delivered he said 
mcdonnelldouglas had no comment on the twaairbus deal said 
don hanson a spokesman for the companys douglas aircraft division 
but he added twa has been a good customer of ours for our 
md80s and we expect that good and fruitful relationship to 
continue 
the narrowbody md80s are among twas newer planes 
icahn took twa private last october in the third quarter of 
1988 the company reported earnings of 88 million up from 571 
million a year earlier while its revenue rose to 127 billion 
from 121 billion 
the company has not yet released fourthquarter figures but a 
twa source said earnings rose during the period

representatives from major coffee producing 
countries will meet here later this week to discuss strategy for 
talks with consuming countries on the future of international 
cooperation to stabilize world prices 
the 25 producing countries belonging to the interafrican coffee 
organization will meet here thursday and friday and the 11nation 
group of producers of the topquality mild arabica type of coffee 
will meet separately on friday 
delegates from both groups said wednesday that a joint meeting 
of all 50 international coffee organization producer members was 
unlikely ahead of mondays start of two weeks of talks with the 
bodys 25 key consuming countries 
this joint meeting is the last scheduled attempt to negotiate a 
new international pricestabilization agreement to replace the 
present one which expires at the end of september 
producers were expected to make proposals for the new pact at 
the joint meeting said jorge ortega mexicos permanent coffee 
representative here 
ortega also is the spokesman for a third group of mild arabica 
coffee producers known as the others members of this group 
include mexico el salvador guatemala costa rica nicaragua and 
peru 
his groups meeting will probably translate into a proposal 
aimed at increasing its share of the market under a new pact 
ortega said 
delegates said that a fight to increase market share would bring 
the others into conflict with most african countries and with 
brazil 
they produce types of coffee less popular with consumers but 
are anxious to hold on to present market shares 
the united states and the european economic community want any 
new coffee pact to increase the participation of other milds in 
the market 
like the present coffee agreement any new deal would probably 
use export quotas to regulate supply and prices

the us justice department is dropping 
its opposition to consolidated freightways incs acquisition of 
emery air freight corp saying it is unlikely a more acceptable 
buyer for the troubled company can be found 
the decision tuesday removed antitrust obstacles to the deal 
under which consolidated based in menlo park calif agreed last 
month to buy wiltonbased emery for 230 million 
the justice department recently asked emery to contact more than 
20 parties the company identified last year as potential buyers to 
see if any were interested because of concerns the consolidated 
deal would curtail competition in the overnight airfreight 
industry 
in a statement issued from washington charles f rule 
assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division 
said the department still believed the acquisition would likely 
prove anticompetitive noting that the industry is dominated by 
only four carriers 
but rule said after a thorough investigation we concluded 
that if the department tried to challenge the proposed acquisition 
emery would be successful in establishing a failing firm defense 
under the antitrust laws 
under the failing firm doctrine an otherwise anticompetitive 
acquisition is not unlawful if two requirements are met the 
company being acquired must show that it will not be able to meet 
its financial obligations through the use of existing assets and 
that it probably would not emerge from a restructuring or 
reorganization as a viable competitor 
the company must also show that no other buyer that would 
represent less of a threat to competition is willing to purchase 
its assets 
we are pleased we have cleared this last regulatory 
requirement patricia bertrand an emery spokeswoman said today 
both companies are anxious to get the merger completed 
consolidated extended its tender offer until midnight friday 
industry analysts said it could have spelled the end of emery if 
the justice department had blocked the sale 
emery lost 51 million last year after losing 48 million in 
1987 
emery is going to get acquired or it is going to go 
bankrupt said mike walker an analyst with legg mason wood 
walker inc in baltimore 
emery is a mess he said its losing a lot of money and 
if consolidated freight cuts it loose it will lose a lot more 
money 
none of the companies being contacted had previously made an 
offer for emery and analysts doubted that another buyer would be 
found 
its a very troubled company said george g morris an 
analyst with prescott ball amp turben inc in cleveland there 
werent any people stepping up to the plate out of the 20 surveyed 
i would doubt very much anything will be changed 
morris noted that consolidated is getting all of emery for 230 
million just two years after emery bought purolator courier corp 
for 348 million 
that should tell you something about the company and how its 
been doing he said 
emerys operations are to be merged with those of consolidateds 
cf air freight inc unit into a new company to be called emery 
worldwide 
walker said the acquisition would give consolidated 40 percent 
to 50 percent of the overnight airfreight business compared to its 
current 20 percent share 
theres more than enough competition out there he said 
consolidated freight is acquiring a very good market position 
but they are not acquiring a monopoly 
consolidated agreed to buy all outstanding emery common stock 
for 775 a share in cash and all outstanding emery preferred stock 
for 2110 a share in stock 
as of tuesday consolidated said that 89 percent of the common 
shares and 75 percent of the preferred stock had been tendered

grain and soybean futures prices crept higher 
this morning on the chicago board of trade reflecting increased 
export demand apparently prompted by a sharp decline in prices 
earlier this week 
soybean futures were supported in early trading by indications 
that the soviet union had made a substantial purchase of south 
american soybean meal earlier in the week 
corn and wheat futures opened fractionally lower following the 
agriculture departments announcement late tuesday that the soviets 
had bought 550000 metric tons of us corn much less than the 2 
million metric tons that had been rumored during tuesdays session 
but grain futures quickly turned higher on news of increased 
export demand for wheat including interest by sri lanka turkey 
and peru 
some traders also remained optimistic that the agriculture 
department would announce further corn sales to the soviets 
in early trading wheat was cent to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 429 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with may at 273 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to 1 cents higher with may at 198 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with may at 764 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 05 cent to 73 cent higher with april at 7805 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 20 cent higher with 
april at 8205 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent lower to 20 
cent higher with april at 4202 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 08 cent to 18 cent higher with may at 3815 cents a pound

former federal reserve chairman paul volcker 
today called inflation a perpetual concern and praised recent 
actions by the the nations central bank to nudge up interest rates 
to combat rising prices 
volcker speaking with reporters at the white house voiced 
particular praise for the policies of the current fed chairman 
alan greenspan 
the inflation rate has been going up some and i think we 
ought to deal with it said volcker 
as fed chairman volcker earned a reputation as the governments 
chief inflation fighter in the early 1980s when he pursued a policy 
of tight credit that drove up interest rates in a successful effort 
to break the back of inflation spiraling in the double digits 
for the first two months of 1989 inflation at the consumer 
price level has been rising at an annual rate of 61 percent at 
the wholesale level prices have been rising at a 126 percent 
annual rate 
volcker who stepped down from the fed in 1987 when his term as 
chairman expired said the economy has been doing pretty well 
it keeps growing what more can i say 
asked directly about inflation volcker said when you talk to 
me i think inflation is a perpetual concern so im delighted to 
see the concern about inflation openly expressed im delighted to 
see what mr greenspan has bene saying about it 
greenspan has argued that higher interest rates are needed in 
the short run to keep a lid on inflation a position that has put 
him at odds with president bush who has said he does not share 
quite the degree of concern over current inflation that greenspan 
does 
i think mr greenspan is well able to take care of himself in 
making those judgments on interest rates volcker said 
he also expressed support of current steps taken by the 
federal reserve generally 
volcker was at the white house to discuss with bush the final 
report of the national commission on public service which has 
recommended pay increases of approximately 50 percent over two 
years for top federal officials volcker is chairman of the 
commission

ford motor co on wednesday announced a new 
incentive program with interest rates as low as 29 percent 2 
percentage points lower than the program it replaces 
the last time automakers financing companies offered interest 
rates as low as 29 percent was in mid1987 
robert rewey fords vice president for north american sales 
said the nations no 2 automaker made the move because car and 
truck sales during the first 80 days of the year fell below 
projections 
rewey said ford had lowered its annual sales prediction for the 
industry to 15 million cars and trucks from 154 million he talked 
about in early february sales during the first 80 days of the year 
worked out to an annual rate of 146 million vehicles he added 
although consumer confidence in the economy remains high rewey 
said car buyers have been hesitating because of recent moves by 
the federal reserve and large banks that have pushed up interest 
rates 
there has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest 
rates in the first quarter of 1989 he said at a news 
conference 
the prime lending rate a benchmark rate on which many other

what this country needs is an emily post for 
facsimile machines electronic mail voice messaging squawk boxes 
and car phones 
technology has outraced etiquette in these new forms of business 
communication producing such modern plagues as junk fax and the 
deadend phone calls to machines known as voice mail jail 
consider these horror stories of bad manners and simple 
ineptitude 
an overzealous sandwich shop operator faxed his menu to a top 
new york state official at the very moment the official was trying 
to send an urgent memo to gov mario cuomo 
the wall street journals chicago bureau had a scoop fall into 
its lap when someone accidentally sent a secret takeover proposal 
to its fax machine 
the irancontra affair unraveled watergatelike when 
investigators discovered a treasure trove of electronic mail 
messages sent by lt col oliver north and his compatriots on an 
internal computer system unknown to the north group every message 
had been stored on computer tape 
in los angeles according to the new york times a man pressed 
the wrong buttons on his phone and sent a private voice love 
message to his entire department 
these cases may not all involve questions of etiquette in the 
narrow sense but they do show that the business world has not 
worked out a comfortable modus vivendi with its own new machinery 
true technology is beginning to solve the problems it created 
for example forbes magazine says future software will be able to 
screen sales pitches from legitimate electronic mail by looking for 
telltale words like insurance and financial planner 
still the time has come for a seasoned practicioner of good 
manners and good sense to spell out certain rules of behavior 
because no one like that has stepped forward here are some 
suggestions for now for 10 tentative communication commandments 
i thou shalt not send unrequested material by fax machine if 
thou must disobey this commandment thou shalt at least keep thy 
junk faxes short and send them during off hours 
ii thou shalt not have a machine answering thy companys main 
phone line even if it does have a pleasant voice people will hang 
up 
iii thou shalt provide an escape route from voice mail jail 
so a caller entrapped in thy system can get back to a human 
operator at any time 
iv thou shalt not clutter thy neighbors electronic mailboxes 
simply because it is easy to code them in on messages 
v thou shalt remember when firing off a message by voice or 
electronic mail that words can sting and illconsidered words could 
come back to haunt thee 
vi if thou insists on sending a backstabbing message thou 
shalt make sure it is going to the intended recipient and not to 
the person whose back is being stabbed 
vii thou shalt not put a caller on a speaker phone 
broadcasting his or her voice around the room unless the caller 
agrees to this invasion of privacy 
viii thou shalt prevent embarrassment by informing the caller 
on a squawk box who else is in the room listening to the 
conversation 
ix thou shalt not discuss sensitive matters by car phone unless 
thou art willing to have others listening in by scanner 
x above all thou shalt never in all thy days refer to 
talking as realtime interfacing

donald c burr built one of the biggest airlines 
from scratch using ultracheap fares to draw millions of customers 
only to see his empire collapse six years later now he could be 
ready to make a comeback 
burr 47 founder of defunct people express airlines has 
started to talk to the press after two years of shunning public 
view he has reemerged at a time when eastern airlines paralyzed 
by a strike and in bankruptcy protection from creditors is 
tottering on extinction 
could burr be putting himself forward as a white knight 
manager to help rescue eastern or gearing up to start a new 
airline to replace it hes dodging the question but 
circumstantial evidence indicates the answer is yes 
burrs formal agreement not to compete against former boss frank 
lorenzo has just effectively expired lorenzo steely chairman of 
texas air corp which controls eastern bought a battered people 
express from burr in september 1986 for 300 million 
at its zenith in 1985 newark njbased people express was a 
wildly successful product of airline deregulation offering 
discount fares to 150 cities and pulling in more than 1 billion a 
year in revenue 
im trying to find a way to reinvent the airline product 
again burr said in an interview 
besides lecturing at universities and writing a book about 
people express during the past two years burr said he has 
informally looked at a few potential new airline deals 
industry sources say he spoke with lorenzo before the eastern 
strike about the possibility of running the carrier burr would 
only say that hes had conceptual talks with the texas air 
chief lorenzo has refused to comment 
what if the rebellious unions at miamibased eastern approached 
him to help take over or run the airline id have to consider 
it he said 
burr talks with evangelical enthusiasm about the airline 
industry whether hes reminiscing about triumphs and travails of 
people express or looking forward to the next chapter of 
deregulation its a talent hes honed on the lecture circuit 
where he commands 10000 a speech 
the airlines are on the verge of unprecedented 
profitability he said perched on the edge of a chair at the 
harvard club in midtown manhattan i would love to see the 
airline industry evolve toward highcommitment service 
organizations 
burrs career path and life have been closely intertwined with 
lorenzos he even served as best man at lorenzos wedding in 
1972 they are only a year apart in age and were both born in may 
under the sign of taurus the bull yet their personalities seem 
poles apart 
with his boyish good looks and disarming ebullience burr is a 
study in contrasts with the gaunt fiercelooking lorenzo who has 
become a leading target of organized labor because of his avowed 
antiunion strategies 
burr born in suburban south windsor conn has been described 
by people in the industry as a preppie entrepreneur lorenzo 48 
grew up in tough streetwise queens ny 
people familiar with the two personalities find it difficult to 
imagine burr working for lorenzo which he did twice and fencing 
with him in one of the most brutally competitive businesses of the 
1980s 
they both attended harvard business school where lorenzo got 
his mba in 1963 and burr received his in 1965 burr then went to 
work as a financial analyst for national aviation corp a new york 
investment company while lorenzo was an analyst for trans world 
airlines inc and later for eastern 
burr was elected president of national aviation in 1971 two 
years after lorenzo created jet capital corp the aircraft leasing 
company that was to become the core of texas air in 1973 after 
lorenzo acquired ailing texas international airlines he recruited 
burr whose national aviation had been an investor in lorenzos 
takeover 
burr became president of texas international where he helped 
chairman lorenzo introduce discount peanut fares that 
revolutionized the industry and made the airline the 
fastestgrowing us carrier 
in january 1980 burr left texas international to take advantage 
of the 1978 deregulation of the industry that let airlines set 
their own fares and fly where they wished 
he started his own lowcost airline people express which 
created an enormous new market of air travelers with a 
payonboard lugyourown bags approach that made his planes the 
greyhound buses of the sky 
after a quick takeoff and supersonic growth people express 
eventually crashed as big competitors undercut burrs discount 
fares to prevent him from taking away their customers after it was 
sold to what was now texas air in september 1986 burr went back to 
work for lorenzo but not for long 
he is careful not to join the lorenzobashing that has become so 
popular the strongest thing burr will say about lorenzo is hes a 
lowcost warhound 
burr says hes too busy thinking about what he calls 
reinventing the product to dwell on the past but as for 
whether hes preparing to fill a void created if eastern 
disappears burr is evasive 
im after the same thing ive been after my whole lifetime 
he said 
end adv for sunday april 2

energy futures prices were mixed in early 
trading today with crude oil regaining some of the ground lost in 
tuesdays selloff 
by noon on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract 
for west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude was 
up 11 cents at 2002 
on tuesday the may crude oil contract had settled at 1991 a 
barrel down 62 cents from mondays close 
in reaction to the alaskan oil spill that temporarily closed a 
major port the contract had gone up 38 cents a barrel monday to 
close at 2053 the highest level since aug 14 1987 when it 
settled at 2057 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange today 
heating oil for april delivery was down 024 cent to 5480 cents a 
gallon and the april unleaded gasoline contract was up 052 cent at 
5920 cents a gallon after two hours of trading 
analysts blamed tuesdays decline largely on profittaking and 
concerns about whether opec ministers will ease production 
restraints during their meeting in vienna this week 
the april contract for wholesale home heating oil plunged on 
tuesday by 254 cents closing at 5504 cents a gallon after rising 
106 cents monday 
april unleaded gasoline which gained 173 cents in the previous 
session settled down 107 cents to 5868 cents a gallon 
mondays rally was triggered by the accident off the alaskan 
port of valdez where an exxon corp tanker ran aground and spilled 
an estimated 101 million gallons of crude oil into prince william 
sound the accident forced the closing of the port temporarily 
cutting us crude supplies by a quarter 
peter beutel an energy analyst at elders futures inc said the 
market sold off tuesday because prices had risen too high too fast 
in the previous session 
i think the market was overbought he said people are now 
cashing in 
also depressing oil prices were worries that the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries might loosen its production quota to 
help slow recent price increases at its regular meeting in vienna 
it introduced an era of uncertainty that didnt exist 
before said william byers an analyst with bear stearns amp co 
opec ministers were upbeat about the strong crude market but 
reluctant to predict that longerterm prices would continue their 
recent climb which has seen wti rising by some 5 a barrel since 
last october 
the 13 member nations agreed last fall to limit their total 
output to 185 million barrels a day in the first half of this year 
to support a price of 18 a barrel

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge dropped 03 percent in february after posting sharp gains 
during the previous two months the commerce department said today 
februarys decline in the departments index of leading economic 
indicators was the first drop since a similar dip last september 
and the largest since a 08 percent drop last july 
it was in line with widespread expectations that the economy 
will slow this year 
the leading index designed to foretell economic activity six to 
nine months into the future had advanced 06 percent in december 
and 07 percent in january after vacillating during much of 1988 
with labor markets tight and factories operating close to peak 
capacity analysts say some slowdown is needed to keep the economy 
from overheating and inflation from spiraling 
however analysts are divided over whether the federal reserve 
board can successfully engineer a controlled slowdown that 
restrains economic growth just enough to ease inflation without 
causing a recession 
the fed for a year has been pushing up interest rates in order 
to relieve inflationary pressures and it intensified those efforts 
after sharp price increases were recorded in january and february 
at the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater pointed to the indexs increase at an annual average rate 
of 15 percent since august 1988 and 35 percent since february 
1988 
the trend is still upward and one months figures dont 
provide a real basis for judging any change in that trend he 
said 
in another report today showing the impact of higher interest 
rates the government reported that sales of new singlefamily 
homes plunged 94 percent in february to the lowest level in more 
than a year 
the commerce department said sales retreated to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 626000 in february following a 25 
percent increase in january and a 37 percent gain in december 
fitzwater also sought to minimize the housing statistics 
saying monthly housing sales vary substantially 
he said the figures also reflected higher interest rates and 
probably some slowing in the economy 
irwin kellner chief economist for manufacturers hanover trust 
co in new york said in advance of todays report that the jagged 
behavior of the leading index suggests the economy has been 
slowing down from its overheated pace and that the economy is 
continuing to slow down as we work our way into the second quarter 
of 1989 
kellner said that despite the federal reserves efforts to 
prolong the life of the economic expansion even as it restrains 
growth the odds are growing each day that the central bank 
will push the nation into a recession 
in february eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading 
index declined with the biggest negative factor being a drop in 
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment 
the other negative factors were a drop in building permits a 
decline in manufacturers orders for consumer goods a contraction 
in the money supply a dip in an index of consumer expectations an 
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits faster vendor 
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in 
manufacturers unfilled orders 
two indicators made positive contributions an increase in 
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand and rising 
stock prices 
one indicator was unchanged last month the length of the 
average work week 
the various changes left the index at 1452 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 over the past 12 months the index has risen 35 
percent after climbing 24 percent over the previous 12month 
period 
the economy began the new year with strong momentum but a 
number of government reports on its performance in february pointed 
downward including drops in retail sales housing construction 
orders for durable goods manufacturing employment and factory 
operating rates 
economist david levy of levy economic forecasts in chappaqua 
ny said that with evidence of an economic slowdown likely to 
mount the fed probably will ease its grip on the money supply by 
midyear 
the probability is very good that we will avoid a recession 
levy said 
the traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three 
straight declines in the leading index the components of the 
composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting 
abilities but when the new index is applied retroactively it 
flashes two false recession signals since the 198182 economic 
downturn 
the economy grew a robust 39 percent in 1988 the best showing 
in four years but most private analysts expect the gross national 
product to expand only by about 27 percent this year slowed by 
higher interest rates and a worsening of the trade deficit 
president bush is counting on a 32 percent gnp gain to allow 
the administration to reduce the federal budget deficit without 
raising taxes but few economists believe the administrations gnp 
forecast is realistic

federal regulators today seized control of 20 
subsidiary banks of mcorp texas second largest banking company 
and pumped in 300 million in government money 
the action put all but five mcorp subsidiary banks under 
government ownership regulators transferred 116 billion in 
deposits of the failed banks to a new governmentowned 
institution deposit insurance bridge bank of dallas 
the federal deposit insurance corp which insures commercial 
bank deposits up to 100000 said the failed banks opened for 
business today and service to customers would continue 
uninterrupted 
as far as the customers are concerned it will be business as 
usual for all 20 banks said l william seidman chairman of the 
fdic 
seidman would not estimate how much the government will 
ultimately have to spend to restore the banks to health saying he 
did not want to reveal that figure to investors expected to bid on 
the banks 
however private analysts have said they expect the failure will 
cost the fdic already depleted by a postdepression record 221 
bank failures last year 1 billion to 2 billion 
that would make the transaction the third most costly commercial 
bank rescue after first republicbank of dallas in 1988 continental 
illinois of chicago in 1984 
we are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as 
possible seidman said but he added that the agency may extend 
its april 3 deadline for offers 
mcorp which has 86 offices lost 903 million last year it is 
the last of the large texas banks to needing to be recapitalized 
either through federal rescue or private merger 
in a statement today mcorp said the five remaining banks and 
the trust subsidiary form the nucleus of a new beginning for 
mcorp which still intends to file for bankruptcy protection 
while the nature of of mcorp has been altered dramatically a 
solid healthy core remains chairman gene h bishop said we 
are extremely pleased that this group of five mbanks had the 
strength and resourcefulness to withstand the incredible pressures 
of the economic downturn over the past several years 
regulators said the 20 insolvent banks had assets of 154 
billion including assets of 64 billion at the lead bank in 
dallas and 32 billion at the next biggest subsidiary in houston 
the five remaining insolvent banks have assets of about 3 billion 
comptroller of the currency robert clarke the chief regulator 
of nationally chartered banks the figure was triggered by demands 
beginning monday on the lead bank in dallas both from depositors 
and from the other banks in the holding company 
on tuesday it became clear as the day wore on that the 
dallas bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of 
depositors clarke said five of the banks were insolvent 
standing on their own and the remaining 15 failed after the dallas 
bank could not meet their demands for deposits the demands of all 
outside customers were met he said 
federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators 
legally could not take control of the five mcorp subsidiary banks 
that remain solvent the move against the 20 has triggered a battle 
over assets held by the holding company regulators maintain that 
holding company assests should be used to defer federal costs in 
rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks but mcorp has resisted 
that 
the fdic intends to pursue potential claims against mcorp for 
liabilities and obligations of mcorp to the 20 subsidiary banks 
that were closed the agency said in a statement 
seidman the fdic chairman declined to say how large the claim 
against the holding company is except to say it is substantial 
and material since last year the insurance fund had been 
trying to force the holding company to inject 400 million into 18 
of its banks 
for future cases the fdic is seeking legislation from congress 
that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up 
sister institutions that fail 
the fdics move came a week after creditors of mcorp forced it 
to seek protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
the holding company had halted payments on 466 million in debt 
last october but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their 
claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with 
the fdic 
reportedly among those interested in buying mcorp is a robert 
abboud chairman of first city bancorporation in houston which was 
itself rescued by the fdic in 1987 with 1 billion 
other likely bidders are kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the 
pritzker family of chicago and a group led by harry gray former 
chairman of united technologies corp 
the 20 mcorp banks seized today were mbank abilene mbank 
alamo mbank austin mbank brenham mbank corsicana mbank dallas 
mbank denton county mbank fort worth mbank greenville mbank 
houston mbank jefferson mbank longview mbank marshall mbank 
midcities mbank odessa mbank orange mbank round rock mbank 
sherman mbank wichita falls and mbank the woodlands 
the five remaining solvent banks are mbank brownsville mbank 
corpus christi mbank waco mbank el paso and mbank new braunfels 
a six subsidiary mtrust corp also remains solvent 
all creditors and depositors even those with accounts higher 
than the 100000 insurance limit are fully protected at all of 
the failed banks except the subsidiary in abilene depositors with 
more than 100000 in that institution will have to pursue a claim 
against the bank and may lose a portion of their uninsured funds 
the fdic appointed james gardner chairman of mbank dallas as 
president of its new governmentowned holding company it said it 
will seek a new chairman from outside the mcorp system

an aggressive exporter for decades japan finds 
itself on the receiving end as asian neighbors pursuing the 
japanese path to success edge into its home market for products 
ranging from clothes to cassette players 
the government is squeezed between domestic demands for 
protection from foreign exporters and international pressure to buy 
more abroad to cut japans mammoth trade surplus 
at least one prominent economist heizo takenaka of osaka 
university has suggested avoiding the us pattern of limiting 
some imports to protect domestic industries 
writing in a recent issue of the economist magazine takenaka 
said such restraints have weakened the competitive power of 
american industry and damaged the economic wellbeing of 
consumers 
south korea and taiwan are leading the asian assault on the 
japanese market capturing the dominant share of textiles 
manufactured goods from asia really began taking off in japan 
over the last year or two because the yens rapid appreciation has 
made them very inexpensive said naruaki fujisaki of the asian 
institute of developing economies 
and we can expect the trend to continue the researcher 
said adding that the new competition has forced japanese 
manufacturers to set up operations in east and southeast asia 
where labor costs are lower 
south korean exports to japan surged by 156 percent in the first 
nine months of 1988 with textile exports growing 160 percent 
machinery 165 percent and steel products 224 percent according to 
the ministry of international trade and industry 
taiwan expanded exports to japan by 152 percent in 1987 with 
textile products up 165 percent and machinery 182 percent ministry 
figures show 
japanese investment in asia meanwhile soared by almost 110 
percent in the fiscal year ended march 1988 to 4868 million 
compared with the yearearlier period the japan external trade 
organization reported in january 
japans textile makers whose losses nearly doubled to 7 
billion in 1988 from 34 billion a year earlier have taken steps 
to protect themselves 
after imports of south korean knitwear soared by more than 60 
percent last year domestic makers accused the south koreans of 
dumping a customergrabbing strategy of selling goods at up to 40 
percent below the fair homemarket price 
south korean sweater makers avoided the first japanese 
government investigation for dumping by agreeing in february to 
limit japanbound exports for three years to within 1 percent of 
the 1988 volume of 634 million sweaters 
we were not only thinking of the knitwear sector said 
kagayaki miyazaki head of the japan textile federation the 
rules that we established will also contribute to steel cement and 
other sectors 
the agreement however has raised criticism that japan is 
backtracking on its pledge to promote free trade 
as a country heavily dependent on global markets japan should 
normally be expected to be the leader in the battle against 
protectionism the nikkei shimbun japans leading economic 
newspaper commented editorially it called the agreement overly 
protective 
for years japan has been the target of charges by trading 
partners that its manufacturers have been dumpers themselves some 
of the most recent charges involved semiconductor computer chips 
to meet foreign demands the japanese also have been voluntarily 
restraining some exports such as usbound cars 
japan is under pressure from the united states and other trading 
partners to reduce its trade surplus by absorbing imports from 
developing asian nations that have been relying on us and 
european markets 
its overall trade surplus totaled 774 billion in 1988 with 
the united states accounting for 4761 billion finance ministry 
figures show 
kazuaki hasegawa of the trade ministrys international trade 
policy bureau said the knitwear dispute was a special case and 
that japan is committed to unrestricted trade and importing more 
from neighbors 
in japan the knitwear association consists of small and 
mediumsize companies and if theres a sudden increase in imports

that case we need countermeasures the united states also has 
negotiated restraints with such major textile exporters as south 
korea taiwan and hong kong 
most of japans 8000 knit makers who employ 150000 workers 
are smalltime operations in a fading industry 
but in such major japanese sectors as steel petrochemicals and 
electronics asian neighbors are working to establish a foothold 
too 
steel imports almost half from south korea rose from 29 
million tons in fiscal 1985 to 5 million tons in fiscal 1987 with 
foreigners holding a 10 percent market share domestic makers are 
starting to clamor for a dumping investigation 
japans petrochemical industry faces keen competition from the 
south korean taiwan hong kong and singapore in the near future a 
governmental advisory committee warned in a recent report 
south korea is due to start two large chemical plants in 1989 
and others are planned in taiwan and other asian nations 
japanese electronics and appliance makers saw profits climb in 
1988 from sales of more sophisticated products such as largescreen

japans most powerful business organization said 
wednesday its members will increase direct investment in developing 
countries to aid those indebted nations 
the federation of economic organizations said it had established 
two new semigovernmental groups composed of representatives of 
leading japanese corporations to promote direct investment in the 
third world 
its important for us to provide not only money but technology 
and management to help develop industries in such countries 
prime minister noboru takeshita said at a meeting of the federation 
the two new groups the japan international development 
organization jaido and the committee on international cooperation 
projects are considering investments in some 80 proposed projects 
including an industrial park in the philippines a copper mine in 
mexico and rubber and eucalyptus cultivation in other countries 
jaido will be set up as a joint stock company with capital 
provided by 98 corporations and the governments overseas economic 
cooperation fund it will use its funds for direct investment in 
joint ventures 
the second group will act as liaison between jaido and 
appropriate government bodies it also will examine jaidos 
proposed investments in light of investment guidelines endorsed by 
the government and the federation of economic organizations to 
ensure the projects are not aimed at promoting japanese exports 
although no projects have been chosen members of the groups 
said four or five would begin this year and 10 would be selected in 
1990 
the projects will be joint ventures with developing countries or 
international organizations such as the world bank and the united 
nations industrial development organization 
following the example of the japanese government the federation 
decided to involve japans private sector in economic development 
efforts members said 
private business is willing to take risks in supporting the 
selfhelp efforts of others kazuo haruna of marubeni corp told 
reporters after the federations gathering 
in a related development the government wednesday approved a

grain and soybean futures prices closed little 
changed wednesday after a quiet session on the chicago board of 
trade 
corn and soybean futures finished slightly lower reflecting 
disappointment in the agriculture departments announcement late 
tuesday that the soviet union had purchased 550000 metric tons of 
us corn traders had been expecting a sale of about 2 million 
metric tons 
losses in the soybean market were limited by indications that 
the soviet union had made a substantial purchase of south american 
soybean meal earlier in the week 
wheat futures ended mostly higher on signs of increased export 
demand for us wheat including interest by sri lanka turkey and 
peru analysts said 
trading activity has slowed ahead of fridays usda quarterly 
grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate those 
reports will form the basis for projections about grain and soybean 
prices during the summer growing season 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 1 cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 428 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with may at 273 a bushel oats were 1 cent lower to 
cent higher with may at 197 a bushel and soybeans were 1

real estate holdings in tokyo and other 
valuable assets of nwa inc make the parent of northwest airlines 
an attractive takeover target but analysts on wednesday said 
significant hurdles could ground a possible buyout bid 
nwa stock activity remained heavy wednesday in the wake of 
tuesdays announcement that an investment group is interested in a 
possible acquisition but the price was down 250 a share to 
6787 in late afternoon trading 
northwest has not identified the investment group which it said 
holds a 49 percent chunk of the airlines 291 million shares 
the group recently notified the eaganbased company of its 
interest in exploring a negotiated leveraged acquisition 
northwest disclosed however no tender offer has been made to 
shareholders and the company wont say whether the investment group 
has made a formal purchase offer to the board of directors 
northwest vowed tuesday to remain independent 
louis marckesano an airline analyst at janney montgomery scott 
inc in philadelphia said he issued a buy recommendation 
wednesday morning for northwest stock because of the takeover 
speculation and because balance sheet fundamentals suggest the 
stock could reach the 80 range by the end of this year without a 
takeover 
its still below what the stock should be trading at 
marckesano said 
the airline company has become a takeover target because it is a 
perennial money maker with assets that could be sold for much more 
than their book value he said 
northwest described by aviation daily as the nations fourth 
largest airline in revenue passenger miles reported a record 
profit for 1988 of 1351 million up 31 percent from 1987 
there are assets to be sold and they could certainly stand a 
lot more debt than they have marckesano said someone who 
wanted to take it over in the 90 to 100 a share range thats 
perfectly feasible 
a buyer could quickly sell northwests land holdings in tokyo 
for example and use the profits to repay debt incurred in the 
acquisition of the airline marckesano said late last year a 
japanese group offered to pay 350 million for part of the downtown 
property the entire holdings could fetch as much as 500 million 
analysts have said 
northwests pacific routes the envy of the industry also could 
be sold to repay acquisition debts marckesano said a new owner 
also could raise money by selling some equipment and then leasing 
it 
he said he isnt concerned about a poison pill defense 
adopted monday by northwests board of directors because he said it 
merely protects against someone stealing the company 
robert decker of chicagobased duff amp phelps agreed that the 
poison pill wont stand in the way of a legitimate offer but 
he said a sound leveraged buyout proposal is unlikely 
the scenario i can see is someone coming in and buying the 
airline and running it like it is decker said to make that 
doable it cant involve a lot of debt so it cant be a leveraged 
buyout then youre down to a very few potential buyers for it 
in a leveraged buyout the buyers typically borrow heavily 
against the cash flow or the assets of the target to make the deal 
too much debt would cripple northwest because the airline will 
need all the cash it can muster in coming years to buy new jets 
decker said the average aircraft in the companys 312jet fleet is 
144 years old compared with the industry average of 117 years he 
said 
mark daugherty of dean witter reynolds inc in new york said the 
burdensome debts of a leveraged buyout would also make the company 
especially vulnerable in an economic downturn 
the idea of cutting back on capital spending and letting 
excess cash flow pay down the debt i dont think you could really 
get away with that daugherty said 
daugherty and decker also said the us justice department could 
pose a problem for suitors interested in a breakup of the airline 
the proposed sale of routes airport gates or other transportation 
operations at northwest would be subject to antitrust 
investigations limiting the number of potential buyers they said 
the industry is more concentrated today there are fewer 
players said charles f rule assistant attorney general in 
charge of the justice departments antitrust division for that 
reason one can say that a proposed further concentration is likely 
to attract a good deal of justice department scrutiny 
yet another potential problem could rise from labor ranks at 
northwest guy cook chairman of the international association of 
machinists district lodge 143 which represents nearly twothirds 
of northwests 35000 employees said wednesday that workers would 
go as far as staging an illegal strike to prevent the sale of 
northwest to a hostile buyer 
our message to any potential buyer is very clear cook said 
if there is an indication on their part there will be a breakup 
theres going to be all out war on this airline

stock prices edged higher in another quiet 
session today on wall street 
traders said there were no factors clearly moving the market 
since government statistics on the economy fell in line with 
expectations and prices of bonds and stocks were little changed 
the commerce department said its index of leading indicators 
fell 03 percent in february following a revised 07 percent 
increase in january 
the figure was close to wall streets forecast and thus had 
little effect on trading said peter vandenberg a market analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc 
the bond market was flat for most of the session before rising 
late in the day the dollar remained buoyant resisting dollar 
sales by the federal reserve and major european central banks

ford motor co smarting from lowerthanexpected 
early 1989 sales said wednesday it would offer cash rebates of up 
to 4000 and newcar financing as low as 29 percent 
there was no immediate indication that rivals general motors 
corp and chrysler corp would match the move by ford which also 
said it was scaling back its fullyear projections for industrywide 
car and light truck sales 
gm and chrysler currently offer cash rebates of up to 2000 and 
financing as low as 49 percent on a variety of cars and trucks 
ford which had been offering similar incentives cited rising 
interest rates that have sapped consumer demand and slowed sales as 
prompting its steppedup program 
robert rewey fords north american sales vice president said 
vehicle sales during the first 80 days of 1989 fell below 
expectations and ford was lowering its prediction for industrywide 
car and light truck sales to about 15 million from the previous 
154 million 
people still want to buy cars and trucks but there may be 
some hesitation rewey said 
part of that hesitation stemmed from the recent rise in interest 
rates set by the federal reserve and banks banks have boosted 
their prime lending rate used as a benchmark on a range of 
consumer and business loans to 115 percent from 105 percent at 
the first of the year 
the banks have boosted their rates in response to interest rate 
pressure by the fed which is attempting to curb inflation by 
tightening credit 
rising rates have ratcheted up house payments for people with 
adjustablerate mortgages causing a slowing in consumer spending 
for durable goods such as cars and trucks rewey said 
there has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest 
rates in the first quarter of this year he said 
we believe the federal reserve actions have generated what 
they wanted to generate he said 
vehicle sales between jan 1 and march 20 this year by the eight 
companies making cars in north america were 54 percent behind last 
years pace automobile sales were off 82 percent and truck sales 
were 03 percent lower than in the yearearlier period 
us sales during the first 80 days of the year have been 
running at an annual rate of about 146 million vehicles rewey 
said typically march and april are big buying months as americans 
prepare for the summertime driving season 
automakers and analysts have said since late last year they 
expected sales to decline from 1988 the secondbest ever but 
there has been concern on wall street that recent sales figures 
were lower than anticipated 
its not surprising given that the 20day sales numbers for 
march do not look good said analyst jeannette garretty of the 
bank of america in san francisco this first quarter is showing 
up very weak 
incentives cut directly into profits and analysts are reviewing 
fords earnings picture 
my guess is that it may prevent fords firstquarter earnings 
from being higher than last years said david healy of drexel 
burnham lambert inc of new york they could be down about 10 
percent 
but joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton in new york said 
fords financial strength overseas would cancel out lower profits 
in north america 
there are offsets to the costs of these incentive programs 
he said so we may not see a significant reduction in earnings in 
the first quarter im not going to change my numbers 
wall street also has been concerned that the industrys vehicle 
inventories have been running higher than anticipated wards 
automotive reports a weekly industry publication said that by the 
end of february there was an 78day supply of cars on dealer lots 
fords car inventory stood at 82 days on march 20 and truck 
inventory was 76 days rewey said virtually the same since the 
first of the year

gasoline and crude oil futures prices spurted 
ahead wednesday while wholesale home heating oil slid back slightly 
the contract for may delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude recovered nearly half of the amount 
lost in tuesdays selloff 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may wti contract ended 
the session at 2020 a barrel up 29 cents from tuesdays 
settlement on tuesday the may crude oil contract shed 62 cents 
from mondays closing level 
prices were bid up in the energy pits monday as traders weighed 
the implications of an oil spill off the alaskan port of valdez 
which caused the temporary closure of the port reducing us crude 
supplies for a time 
among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
unleaded gasoline for april delivery rose 150 cents settling at 
6018 cents a gallon the april heating oil contract finished off 
042 cent at 5462 cents a gallon but contracts for may june and 
july delivery all posted gains 
john h oconnell a senior energy analyst at refco inc said 
energy futures weakened in the early going wednesday and then 
gained fresh upward momentum mainly because of buying in the 
gasoline pits 
everybodys in love with gasoline said oconnell 
traders have been buying gasoline in recent weeks amid 
speculation that supplies could be tight this summer in the 
northeast if refiners in the region are required to alter their 
methods gasoline refining changes which would cut 
pollutioncausing emissions have been proposed in a plan aimed at 
reducing smog in the northeastern states 
oconnell said some of the gasoline buying wednesday may have 
been caused by a change in the new york mercantile exchanges 
contract specifications the exchange made the change to comply 
with recently altered industry practices 
meanwhile crude oil buying may have been spurred by indications 
that the opec countries are in no hurry to establish higher crude 
production levels 
an opec monitoring committee met wednesday in vienna austria to 
formally review the cartels priceboosting strategy 
subroto secretarygeneral of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries said the eight panel members 
discussed a range of topics in the fourhour closeddoor meeting 
but he refused to elaborate 
the function of the committee is to review prices and to 
review production quotas he said we are not going to 
make any decision

a california company can pursue its 970 million 
bid for prime computer inc once details of investment banker 
drexel burnham lambert incs financial role are disclosed a 
federal appeals court ruled wednesday 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court 
ruling blocking the takeover bid by mai basic four inc on grounds 
that drexels role in the deal made it a cobidder 
but the appeals court said an injunction against the bid issued 
in december would be lifted after tustin califbased mai basic 
makes specific disclosures to the securities and exchange 
commission 
the decision requires mai basic to provide drexel financial 
statements records of recent stock trading activity and 
identification of all drexelaffiliated officers and directors 
mai basic president william b patton said the company would 
work with drexel to comply with the court guidelines and disclose 
all pertinent documents 
mai basic has offered 20 a share for natickbased prime which 
is four times the size of its suitor 
but patton said legal infighting could prove moot after prime 
shareholders hold their annual meeting may 12 
the whole thing is going to come down to a proxy fight 
anyway he said weve applied to the sec for approval and 
were expecting it any day after that the court actions become 
nothing more than legal jostling 
prime spokesman joe gavaghan said the appeals court ruling 
affirmed the companys position that stockholders need additional 
information before deciding on the takeover 
us district judge a david mazzone last month continued his 
order blocking mais bid while asking for additional information 
about how drexel would finance the deal 
in january mai basic said the wall street firm was confident it 
could raise 875 million to finance the takeover despite its guilty 
plea in a massive securities fraud settlement

sugar futures prices bounced back from recent lows in active 
trading wednesday on indications that cuba was renegotiating some 
of its deliveries to trade houses so that it could meet its 
commitments to the soviet union 
on other markets most energy futures advanced gold and silver 
futures retreated grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock 
and meat futures were mixed 
sugar settled 50 cent to 89 cent higher on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in may at 
1220 cents a pound 
the rally erased nearly all the losses that had followed last 
weeks statements by the soviet union that it had bought all the 
sugar it needed for this year 
analysts noted some signs wednesday that moscow may be planning 
further sugar purchases despite its statements to the contrary 
but the main impetus for the runup was heavy buying by the 
french trade house sucres et denrees which was believed to be 
scrambling for supplies because it had agreed to return to cuba 
150000 metric tons of sugar for redelivery to the soviet union 
the possible cause is that russia put pressure on cuba and 
they had to fulfill their commitment to russia said eric 
dunlaevy a sugar trader with balfour maclaine corp in new york 
cuba might have said to the trade house something like we owe 
you sugar can we have it back and repay you in 1990 
cuba the worlds fourthlargest sugar producer has 
overcommitted itself on sugar sales for the past two or three 
years analysts said 
they are committed to ship 42 million tons to the soviets 
this year and they have to say what commitment do we meet that 
commitment or our commitment to the trade houses said analyst 
kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital markets inc 
this indicates they are going to try to meet their commitments 
to the soviet union he said 
crude oil futures rose moderately on the new york mercantile 
exchange after a day of volatile activity linked to concerns about 
the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska and an opec monitoring 
committee meeting in vienna austria 
heating oil futures finished mixed but gasoline prices rose 
sharply in reaction to an american petroleum institute report 
showing a largerthanexpected drawdown in us gasoline stocks 
last week 
west texas intermediate crude settled 26 cents to 37 cents 
higher with may at 2020 a barrel heating oil was 42 cent lower 
to 44 cent higher with april at 5462 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 65 cent to 159 cent higher with april at 6018 cents 
a gallon 
gold futures fell slightly while silver posted steeper losses on 
new yorks commodity exchange as inflation fears continued to ease 
following the commerce departments report of a 03 percent decline 
in the index of leading economic indicators 
gold settled unchanged to 130 lower with april at 38350 a 
troy ounce silver was 36 cents to 58 cents lower with may at 
5808 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished little changed in a quiet 
session on the chicago board of trade 
trading activity has slowed ahead of fridays usda quarterly 
grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate

the dollar lost some ground in choppy domestic 
trading wednesday after rising in foreign exchange trading overseas 
gold prices were mostly lower republic national bank of new 
york quoted a bid of 38180 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 pm 
est compared with 38300 late tuesday 
the dollar closed higher in europe and remained relatively 
strong when dealing shifted to new york traders noted that 
activity had slowed to a trickle in the afternoon and that buying 
was mostly speculative in nature 
the dollar has made a key surge to the upside and is now 
beginning to stabilize said jack barbanel a senior vice 
president at gruntal amp co 
traders believe that there is still room for interest rates to 
move higher despite a spate of recent government statistics 
showing the economy may be cooling down higher interest rates 
support the dollar by making dollardenominated securities more 
attractive 
the major central banks with the exception of the influential 
bank of japan tried to depress the dollar by selling the currency 
but analysts noted that their effort was restrained 
while the central banks want to make their presence known one 
gets the impression that they are not willing to really turn the 
market around at this stage said steve leach a currency analyst 
at chemical bank 
feeding that sentiment were comments by michael boskin chairman 
of the council of economic advisers who indicated the dollar 
remains at competitive levels for us manufacturers despite its 
rise this week to sevenmonth highs

eastern airlines seeking to lure passengers scared 
off by a fourweek strike has expanded an ontime guarantee for 
northeast travelers and offered a 25 gift check for all passengers 
on the eastern shuttle and on 14 nonstop flights between 
washington and boston 
the airline announced wednesday that beginning april 3 all 
travelers flying eastern between boston and washington will have 
the price of their tickets refunded if their flight departs more 
than five minutes late the passengers will receive a 25 american 
express check just for flying eastern on those routes 
both the ontime and american express offers on the shuttle and 
nonstop flights between boston and washington will be good until 
april 30 the airline said the carrier also discounted the 
nonstop bostonwashington flights for weekend travelers 
eastern was extending a shuttle ontime guarantee that started 
march 20 and would have expired march 31 and expanding that 
guarantee to the nonstop bostonwashington flights 
cash or a chargecard credit will be offered to any passenger 
who qualifies for the refund or the customer can choose to receive 
a free oneway ticket on the same route for future travel 
the incentives are a direct response to disappointing passenger 
loads on the shuttle and union activity designed to keep passengers 
off the onceproud commuter line eastern runs between washington 
new york and boston 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said easterns passenger loads 
have been running less than half of the prestrike levels on many 
of the 120passenger dc9 planes that make the 60 to 62 shutttle 
flights each day less than 10 percent of the flights use boeing 
727s with a capacity of 177 passengers 
ashlock conceded that union strategies to keep people away from 
eastern have had an effect he said picket activity by the 
machinists and pilots in boston and new york has contributed to the 
reluctance of passengers to fly the shuttle 
ashlock said passenger loads on the san juan puerto rico and 
latin american flights have been stronger but the incentives are 
needed to bolster the shuttle which accounts for more than half of 
the carriers approximate 105 to 110 flights each day 
the airline also said it is offering a special 98 weekend 
roundtrip discount fare on bostonwashington flights during the 
month of april 
previously the fare ranged from 238 to 368 depending on how 
early the ticket is bought 
passengers must complete both flight segments between saturday 
and sunday of the same weekend the carrier offers 14 round trips 
daily between the two cities

texas energywrecked economy doomed mcorp despite 
the bank holding companys focus on real estate instead of energy 
loans analysts said wednesday after regulators seized control of 
most of the bank holding company 
once texas real estate markets began to slip there really was 
very little they could do said banking analyst michael starr at 
duff amp phelps inc in chicago what youre seeing in the real 
estate market is simply what started a decade ago in energy 
problems mcorp is at the tailend of feeling those problems 
twenty of mcorps 25 banks including the two largest in dallas 
and houston were declared insolvent late tuesday and early 
wednesday and the federal deposit insurance corp took over 
management under a newly chartered federally owned deposit 
insurance bridge bank na while regulators look for a buyer for some 
or all of the banks 
the fdic pumped 300 million into the banks but officials would 
not say how much government aid ultimately will be required 
analysts have said the price tag could run between 1 billion and 
2 billion 
while it was the soft real estate market mcorps own 60story 
tower in downtown dallas is only about 60 percent rented that 
undercut the bank a move late last week began the final tumble 
sn phelps amp co a connecticutt bondtrading firm and two of 
its employees sought to force mcorp into bankruptcy because it had 
not made payments on a little more than 2 million in bonds they 
held 
mcorp had suspended payment last october on about 470 million 
in bonds and preferred stock 
mcorp on monday said it would seek protection instead from 
creditors under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code 
the resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on deposits 
federal regulators speaking on condition of anonymity said 
between 50 million and 100 million was withdrawn tuesday from 
mbank dallas the firms lead institution the withdrawals came 
both from individual depositors and some of mcorps other 
subsidiary banks the regulators said 
the federal reserve bank of dallas said wednesday the fdic told 
the office of the comptroller of the currency it would no longer 
provide open assistance to mcorp 
the occ then advised the federal reserve bank of dallas that 
under these circumstances they did not consider mcorp a viable 
financial institution according to a statement from the dallas 
fed therefore tuesday march 28 1989 the dallas fed called 
mcorps loan 
the dallas fed would not reveal the size of mcorps loan but 
figures from the central banks statement of condition indicate 
that loans from the dallas branch have gone from 778 million on 
jan 26 to 123 billion on march 23 
mcorp is the latest large bank rescue in texas although other 
institutions notably texas american bancshares inc of fort worth 
and national bancshares corp of texas inc in san antonio have 
asked for federal assistance and word could come at any time on the 
resolution of those problems 
earlier this decade the texas economy was booming on 
projections of 50perbarrel oil and that optimism spread to 
developers who rushed to put up project after project some on 
flimsy or nonexistent demand according to experts 
a recent survey of real estate owners and developers found 89 
percent who strongly agreed or somewhat agreed that the 
dallasfort worth market is overbuilt 
in its thirdquarter report to stockholders mcorp said asset 
quality problems largely releated to loans secured by real estate 
and assets acquired upon foreclosure adversely affected the 
companys financial performance 
the bank reported a thirdquarter loss of 517 million and the 
fdic says mcorps 25 banks lost 213 million in the fourth quarter 
and 903 million for the entire year 
mcorp has yet to release full financial results for the quarter 
and year 
the straightforward honest answer is that the state of texas 
was hit by an economic hbomb that had effects on real estate 
portfolios energy portfolios international portfolios and 
domestic portfolios said robert d rieke a banking analyst with 
the dallas firm of rauscher pierce refsnes inc 
to its tribute mcorp has been able to withstand the fallout 
longer than anybody else said rieke once a vicepresident and 
treasurer at mcorp 
oil prices dropped rather than rose in the mid1980s and the 
impact hit houston first and later the dallas economy 
duff amp phelps starr said mcorp probably was guilty of some 
overaggressive lending but not to the extent of some other 
texas banks and most of its loans were to largely reputable 
developers 
mcorp chairman gene bishop who had attempted to put together a 
private recapitalization plan said wednesday the five banks left 
form the nucleus of a new beginning for mcorp 
but neither rieke nor starr expect that effort to be successful

the maker of maalox is suing the maker of 
peptobismol in a battle between stomach remedies 
rorer pharmaceutical corp of fort washington pa contends in 
the suit filed in federal court in new york that peptobismols 
labeling advertising and promotion are false and misleading 
in its suit rorer contends sweeping unsubstantiated 
statements by peptobismols maker procter amp gamble co have hurt 
the sales and reputation of maalox rorers 40yearold antacid 
rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they have 
lost in sales but the suit calls the sum substantial 
teri glover a spokeswoman at procter amp gambles headquarters in 
cincinnati said the company had not seen the court papers and 
could not comment 
procter amp gamble acquired 88yearold peptobismol in 1982 when 
it bought norwich eaton pharmaceuticals which also is named as a 
defendant in the suit 
rorers suit also alleges that a new maximum strength 
peptobismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved by 
the us food and drug administration 
in addition rorer said it is disturbed that procter amp gamble 
contends peptobismol treats a host of ailments including 
heartburn indigestion nausea and upset stomach 
rorer contends peptobismol is effective against only heartburn 
fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in food 
and alcohol 
the fda has specifically found that peptobismol is not 
effective for most of the claims for which it is promoted said 
the suit filed thursday 
brad stone an fda spokesman said the agency had no comment on 
the suit 
the maalox line of overthecounter antacids is the bestselling 
antacid in the nation and the world it had us sales exceeding 
105 million last year giving it about 15 percent of the market 
for antacids said richard driansky a vice president and chief 
counsel for rorer a division of rorer group inc

hewlettpackard co said wednesday it 
will begin selling leading models of its computer workstations 
through the nations two largest industrial distributors a move 
reflecting the falling prices of the machines throughout the 
industry 
the company said it has signed distribution agreements with 
schweber electronics and hallmark electronics corp to sell some 
models of its hp 9000 series 300 which adheres to atampts unix 
system v interface definition issue 2 
digital equipment corp has been offering its midsized 
workstations through industrial distributors for some time and 
hewlettpackards strategy represents an industry trend needed 
because prices of the computers have become dramatically cheaper in 
recent years said technology analyst adam cuhney at kidder peabody 
amp co 
it is simply not very appropriate any longer because of how 
affordable these machines have become to devote the resources of a 
direct sales force to selling them cuhney added 
new yorkbased schweber part of the lex electronics company 
has 39 us locations and 408 sales representatives hallmark 
based in dallas has 35 us locations and 170 sales 
representatives 
entrylevel workstations have dropped to less than 5000 so 
many small and mediumsized companies now can afford workstations 
for engineering design and commercial applications said richard 
c watts director of marketing for hps computer products division 
watts said the distribution agreements will allow hps direct 
sales force to concentrate on fortune 1000 companies 
the worldwide market for general purpose and technical 
workstations highpowered desktop computers that range in cost up 
to 80000 is estimated at 4 billion and growing rapidly such 
machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities over standard 
personal computers particularly in visual displays speed and 
mathematical calculations

the leader of northwest airlines largest 
union said wednesday he would vigorously resist if someone succeeds 
in buying the airline with the intent of breaking it up 
our message to any potential buyer is very clear said guy 
cook chairman of international association of machinists district 
lodge 143 if there is an indication on their part there will be 
a breakup theres going to be allout war on this airline 
cook said management at northwest would not disclose to him the 
identity of the investment group that the company says is 
interested in acquiring the airline 
northwest parent nwa inc on tuesday said the investment group 
holds 49 percent of the companys 291 million shares and has 
shown an interest in a negotiated leveraged acquisition 
the airline which has vowed to remain independent wouldnt say 
whether the group has made a formal purchase proposal and the group 
has not made its intentions public 
cook whose union represents nearly twothirds of northwests 
35000 employees said he suspects the investment group would have 
to borrow a lot of money to buy northwest to repay debts of the 
leveraged buyout the new owners would probably sell some of the 
companys assets and eliminate some jobs he said 
if a hostile takeover artist threatens to break up the airline 
cook said the unions would consider their own takeover of 
northwest he said the unions could possibly outbid a hostile 
suitor by agreeing to contract concessions as part of their own 
leveraged buyout 
a spokewoman for teamsters local 2747 which represents about 
7000 northwest flight attendants said the union would not comment 
on the situation

cfm international a joint venture of 
general electric co and the french manufacturer snecma announced 
wednesday that it has negotiated a 1 billion contract to supply 
usair with as many as 250 cfm563 model jet engines 
cfm international which is based in this cincinnati suburb 
said the 1 billion supply agreement is the largest in the 10 years 
since it began selling jet engines 
the cfm563 is used in the boeing 737300 737400 and 737500

four companies plans to offer shareholders a 
chance to exchange up to 56 billion in stock for new financial 
instruments called unbundled stock units have come unraveled 
american express co dow chemical co pfizer inc joined sara 
lee corp in saying wednesday they wouldnt proceed with plans to 
offer to exchange up to 20 percent of their common stock for the 
unbundled units called usus 
in trading on the new york stock exchange the prices of all 
four companies stocks rose american express rose 25 cents a share 
to 3112 pfizer rose 62 cents a share to 5712 dow chemical 
was up 125 a share at 9087 and sara lee was up 62 cents a 
share at 48 
the company decisions came a day after their underwriter and the 
inventor of the new securities shearson lehman hutton inc 
advised them that the securities and exchange commission staff 
objected to an accounting treatment that shearson said was an 
important motivation for making the exchange 
shearson said the sec staff believed the new securities should 
be counted among total shares outstanding in determining a 
companys earnings per share 
that ruling would frustrate a key motivation for a company to 
offer the exchange reducing the amount of its common stock 
outstanding and thereby boosting earnings per share 
shearson said it therefore would recommend that the four 
companies withdraw the planned offering of usus and all four agreed 
under shearsons plan each usu would consist of a 30year bond 
a preferred stock share and a stock appreciation certificate the 
three components could be traded separately in combinations or as 
a unit 
shearson said the exchange would give companies a way to reduce 
the amount of stock they have outstanding without taking on a big 
debt load as would be required with normal stock buybacks or 
restructuring 
the firm felt it could also help boost stock prices by calling 
attention to the reasons people buy stock the dividend the 
chance that the dividend will be raised and the hope that the stock 
price will rise and by possibly helping to actually lift its 
stock price 
while we believe this innovative plan would have created 
excellent value for our stockholders we will aggressively pursue 
other attractive financial concepts that offer us opportunities to 
create shareholder wealth john h bryan jr sara lees chairman 
and chief executive said in a statement released late tuesday 
howard l clark jr chief financial officer for american 
express said we are disappointed that we will not be able to 
incorporate this new financial instrument into our stock repurchase 
program 
at the same time we applaud the innovative creative efforts 
that shearson put into the project he said 
american express owns 705 percent of shearsons outstanding 
stock 
the companies on dec 5 each filed their plans to make the 
exchange and the sec staff has been reviewing those plans 
brokerage industry analysts said that while industry followers 
admired shearsons creativity in creating the usu many 
institutional investors were skeptical about the plan 
some investors didnt like the idea that usus would carry no 
voting rights others questioned whether there would be enough usus 
in circulation to create a liquid market and others were skeptical 
that the market price for the usu would match or exceed that for 
the common stock 
nonetheless ron gallatin the shearson managing director who 
oversaw development of the usu concept said he was confident there 
would have been enough institutions interested in making the swap 
that the exchange would have been successful

american officials are uncertain whether an 
accord will be reached by the japaneseset friday deadline for a 
controversial jet fighter the two countries hope to build together 
the white house said wednesday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the delay in 
reaching an accord to build the controversial fsx fighter is 
directly due to president bushs insistence on safeguards to 
protect us technology 
we dont know well take it a day at a time fitzwater told 
reporters when asked if the friday deadline would be met 
its not a hard and fast dropdead deadline either well do 
the best we can fitzwater said 
the japanese government claims the agreement must be nailed down 
by friday so that money for it can be included in its budget for 
the upcoming japanese fiscal year which begins april 1 
we still cant put a timetable on it fitzwater said 
he said talks were still progressing at other levels even 
though japans chief negotiator on the project returned on tuesday 
to tokyo 
the presidents proposal and position on it has remaind rather 
firm through all of this which is one of the reasons why its 
taking so long fitzwater said 
bush has said he supports the project negotiated by the reagan 
administration but only with certain conditions under the plan 
general dynamics and japans mitsubishi heavy industries would 
jointly build the new plane to be modeled after the americanmade 
f16 fighter 
in tokyo an official for japans defense agency said wednesday 
the japanese government would sign a contract with mitsubishi for 
development of the fighter jet despite the continuing negotiations 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
government would sign the contract on thursday or friday for 
development of the fsx even if the two countries do not reach a 
final agreement on the project by then 
takaaki yamada vice president of mitsubishis aircraft 
division said the defense agencys decision to sign the contract 
was a step forward in the fsx joint development project 
a group of 43 legislators from japans ruling liberal democratic 
party said japan might want to build the aircraft on its own 
the legislators presented a petition to the government urging 
that it proceed with development of the fighter with or without 
us help 
japanese opponents have argued that tokyo should scrap the 
accord and go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on 
its own 
among the outstanding disputes are questions over who owns the 
technology that emerges from the project how many of the fighters 
would be built in the united states and how to protect 
sophisticated us computer software used to fly and control the 
plane 
im told there are pieces of those issues that are still 
unresolved fitzwater said

four opposition parties opened talks on wednesday 
about forming a coalition government they hope may replace the 
scandalridden cabinet of prime minister noboru takeshita whose 
popularity has nosedived 
the mass circulation newspaper mainichi shimbun reported 
wednesday that only 9 percent of those responding to its poll 
supported takeshita the lowest rating since the newspaper began 
such surveys in 1947 
in mainichis last poll in december support for takeshita stood 
at 18 percent 
the newspaper linked the sharp drop to a widening 
stockprofiteering scandal involving influential politicians 
bureaucrats and businessmen and to a new 3 percent sales tax that 
goes into effect on saturday 
takeshita has rejected opposition demands that he resign and let 
the public give its verdict in new elections after the latest 
polls he reiterated a vow to push through political reforms to 
restore public trust in government 
elections for half the seats in the upper house of parliament 
are due this summer a serious setback could cost takeshita his 
leadership of the governing liberal democratic party and 
consequently his position as prime minister

desperate fishermen in a fleet of small 
boats wednesday fought the nations worst oil spill with booms 
rakes and shovels while state officials launched a criminal 
investigation into the disaster 
meanwhile a harbor pilot and coast guard official told 
investigators they smelled alcohol on the breath of the tankers 
captain before and after the vessel ran aground friday in prince 
william sound a federal official said 
but both agreed that exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood 
appeared competent said william woody chief of the fourman 
national transportation safety board team assigned to the disaster 
as the 101 milliongallon spill spread over more than 500 
square miles a former top port official charged that cutbacks had 
left operators of the port of valdez with illmaintained booms no 
barge to take on oil and virtually no properly trained people to 
respond to the disaster 
at least 40 people and five fishing boats were sent to protect 
one of the worlds largest salmon hatcheries at port san juan 
other vessels made a stand at eshmay bay and main bay 
the spill is all over prince william sound gov steve 
cowper said it is headed for montague strait 
wind and currents have stretched the slick into ragged patches 
of shifting irridescent oil on crystal blue water the heavy goo 
surrounds several islands gravel beaches and rocky points smeared 
with a black band of oil 
the strait is an outlet to the gulf of alaska and cowper said 
that is where everyone hopes the oil goes rather than bouncing 
around like a pinball in prince william sound and polluting it for 
years 
once in the gulf cowper said there is no way of telling where 
the oil might go if it continues southwest as it has it could 
jeopardize valuable fisheries around kodiak 
valdez mayor john devens has estimated the loss to the fishing 
industry at 150 million 
despite fears of immediate damage to the fisheries some 
officials warned the worst may yet lie ahead 
this spill will devastate the ecosystem long after wildlife 
that now has been exposed has died said jon lyman a spokesman 
for the alaska department of fish and game he said thousands of 
birds including bald eagles may die in the coming years nearly 
100 birds have been caught in the oil already 
the oil invading estuaries and coves is far worse than is being 
described exxon and other official sources said kathy frost a 
marine mammal biologist 
there are animals in the oil she said we dont know what 
it will do with them there have been few experiments now its 
happening in real life 
meanwhile exxon officials said they hoped to finish unloading 
the stricken tanker by friday exxon spokesman don cornett said 
390000 of the 1 million barrels that were left on board after the 
spill had been pumped into the tanker exxon baton rouge 
deputy attorney general ron lorenson arrived in valdez and said 
he was conducting a criminal investigation 
the only crewman willing to talk to investigators has been 
robert kagan who was at the helm woody said he told 
investigators he received a flurry of orders calling for hard turns 
just before the tanker went on a bumpy ride 
exxon officials said hazelwood was not on the bridge when the 
tanker struck a reef onehalf mile outside of established shipping 
lanes third mate gregory cousins was giving the orders 
on the advice of their lawyers hazelwood and cousins have 
refused to talk to investigators woody said delaying a public 
inquiry by perhaps weeks 
hazelwood who had his drivers license suspended because of a 
drunken driving conviction was given a bloodalcohol test after 
the accident but woody said it may have been too late for the 
results to be conclusive 
hazelwoods mother told the associated press that her son had a 
history of alcohol abuse and that exxon was aware of it 
cowper told a team dispatched by president bush that a federal 
takeover of the effort was unnecessary 
now i think weve got a command situation i think is going to 
work he said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told bush things were 
more positive than they appeared earlier in the week white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington 
skinner environmental protection agency administrator bill 
reilly and coast guard commandant paul yost planned to return to 
washington on thursday 
mayor devens said his community felt a little betrayed by 
the oil industry and its inability to clean up the mess as it had 
promised 
the seattle times reported in wednesdays editions that the oil 
industry consortium operating the valdez port had cut back its oil 
spill cleanup resources severely in recent years 
the cutbacks prevented the consortium from acting quickly in the 
early hours of the spill when it still might have been contained 
said james woodle retired coast guard commander and general 
manager of the port of valdez from 1982 to 1984 
you cant clean up everything in 48 hours woodle said 
but you can contain it and they could have done it with this one 
if they had the manpower the initial response 
charles odonnell superintendent of the marine terminal at 
valdez said the consortium alyeska pipeline service co was 
operating under a plan approved by state and federal authorities
